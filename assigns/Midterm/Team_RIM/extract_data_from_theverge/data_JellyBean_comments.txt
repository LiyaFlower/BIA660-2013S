<p>Still lags&#8230;lmao.</p>
<p>iOS lags. I have used the newest iPad and it lags when going from the first screen to the search screen.</p>
<p>This is true, but otherwise, I don&#8217;t know any egregious lag in my 3rd gen iPad. My iPhone is a different story. Lag city.</p>

<strong>&#8220;With Google Now, Android Puts Apple&#8217;s Siri To Shame&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Now, shall we give Siri a rest?</p>
<p>comment from YouTube</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>This﻿ is not voice recognition&#8230; this is sorcery.</strong><em></em>&#8221;</p>
<p>:))</p>
<p>As with Dieter&#8217;s video walk through of Siri vs Now, he seems to be rooting for Siri.</p>
<p>He is the only tech writer I&#8217;ve see (outside of Apple fanboy sites) that says Now isn&#8217;t as good as Siri.</p>
<p>In my use with both, Siri can do things like &#8220;remind me to put out the trash when I get home&#8221; &#8211; a nice feature but when it comes to day to day information I would otherwise search the web for, Now  destroys Siri. Both in speed and information returned. (google search right below the &#8220;card&#8221; is a stroke of genius!)</p>
<p>This is a huge step forward for Google and while Apple will beef up Siri over time, I am left wondering if Google&#8217;s model for content consumption through voice or text will seriously put a hurt on any competition! We&#8217;re talking about a system that learns from your Google searches! Apple doesn&#8217;t have that kind of back-end to work with. Out of the gate Google has access to years of what I&#8217;ve searched for and my trends.</p>
<p>I for one can&#8217;t wait to see how this all plays out. Either way, it&#8217;s a win for the consumer!</p>
<p>I thought &#8220;Google Now&#8221; was the feature that automatically provides you at-a-glance information and that &#8220;Voice Search&#8221; is what Dieter compared.  Does the &#8220;Google Now&#8221; name encompass the new voice search as well?</p>
<p>Techincally you&#8217;re right. But because voice search is at the top of Now and the answers return in the &#8220;card&#8221; style layout, I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that Now will refer to Now/Voice Search from here on out.</p>
<p>Google Now sounds a lot like Bing local scout to me. Not sure why that parallel wasn&#8217;t drawn in the review.</p>
<p>Microsoft are terrible at naming their products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bing Local Scout&#8221;?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right. They should have called it CoffeeCoffee instead.</p>

<p><strong>Google Voice Search is really impressive!</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>In my use with both, Siri can do things like "remind me to put out the trash when I get home" – a nice feature</em> but when it comes to day to day information I would otherwise search the web for, Now destroys Siri. Both in speed and information returned. </blockquote>
<p>This is actually a pretty important distinction. Siri is billed as an assistant, not a search tool. It&#8217;s supposed to be better at helping you with those things. The speed argument is interesting, and somewhat pointless, IMO. No one is going to be complaining that much over a half a second in speed differences. Now and Siri, while similar in many respects, direct comparisons aren&#8217;t necessarily the best measure. They are different enough (as are their use cases) to be able to &#8220;destroy&#8221; eachother in various different scenarios.</p>
<p>Yes, Now is undoubtedly faster, but it&#8217;s also, undoubtedly, less overloaded by users. Whether or not that will eventually affect it&#8217;s speed is yet to be determined, but Siri was quite fast before it was heavily used as well.</p>
<p>Now/voice search replies to me as if I was asking a question to a human who knows the answer. An almost instant reply.</p>
<p>Siri on the otherhand feels more like a computer looking up the answer and then replying.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see about speed. Google has always been one of my favorite companies as far as database speed is concerned</p>
<p>Did you not read comment you were replying to?</p>
<p>Yes Google malice faster currently, but give it some time and it may disclose Siri.yes google now is much faster than siri as of now.  But when users actually have it it may slow done quite a lot.</p>
<p>Then again it will probably only be on .00001% of android devices after a year, so it may stay this fast forever.</p>
<p>Eagerly anticipating the launch of Google Malice.</p>
<p>Maybe you didn&#8217;t read.<br />
&#8220;We’ll see about speed. Google has always been one of my favorite companies as far as database speed is concerned&#8221;</p>
<p>If I have an actual personal assistant but I have to tell the person every single thing I want it to do, then I would fire him/her.<br />
Personal assistant supposed to take care of everything for you and from time to time, you would ask for something extra.</p>
<p>In that regard, Google Now is a more personal assistant than Siri</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit awesome/scary to think about. But a good idea of a perfected &#8220;personal assistant&#8221; is Jarvis from Iron Man.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather every Android phone ship with my boy here&#8230;.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news_img/10101/_10101.jpg" /></p>
<p>Just be sure it doesn&#8217;t blow the doors off&#8230;</p>
<p>Nice one!</p>
<p>Haha, now go watch &#8220;The Trip&#8221; with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, where they continue to give Michael Caine impersonations. Great Flick!</p>
<p>I want to Get Carter with Key Lime Pie too.</p>
<p>Can you have Google Now remind you of something when you leave/arrive at a location? Because I&#8217;d fire any personal assistant that couldn&#8217;t do something that basic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d fire the assistant that didn&#8217;t remind me that if I don&#8217;t leave now for a meeting across town I will be late, due to traffic.</p>
<p>Thankfully, location based notifications aren&#8217;t new in Android.</p>
<blockquote>In that regard, Google Now is a more personal assistant than Siri</blockquote>
<p>Although I haven&#8217;t used Now (don&#8217;t have it on my Nexus yet), it seems like it would make for a relatively useless personal assistant &#8211; at least in my line of work.</p>
<p>I currently feed Siri lines such as, &#8220;remind me in an hour to call Maria&#8221; or &#8220;Schedule an appointment with Dave on Thursday&#8221; and Siri does just that. Siri is also great for dictating emails (&#8220;Email Ben and tell him I&#8217;m going to be late&#8221;) or texting, hands free.</p>
<p>Best I can tell, Google Now can&#8217;t do any of that. So unless my job involves lots of trivia (what is the capital of Botswana?), I can&#8217;t see how it would be a better personal assistant.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t you get it? google voice search is just a part of google now.<br />
Google Now does so much more than voice search (and yes you can set up appointment with it too)</p>
<p>Siri&#8217;s strong point seems to be understanding natural language better to take actions. <br />
Now seems to be good at aggregating and presenting very relevant info based on time and location pre-emptively. And its fast at that.<br />
Its only a matter of time Siri&#8217;s voice becomes more human(I guess Apple will shoot for fall) and also faster. But there&#8217;s a wish, what if apple partnered with facebook to provide that preemptive information. If done correctly Facebook would be a huge leverage for Apple.</p>
<p>I think this sums up the difference between siri and google now the best:<br />
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-now-better-than-siri-2012-7" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/google-now-better-than-siri-2012-7</a></p>
<p>Siri is slightly better at setting up appointments and all that, but you need to tell it what to do. Google Now just do it based on your history.</p>
<p>You probably need to go have a look at some of the youtube videos, it can certainly do some those things. <br />
If you say &#8220;remind me in an hour to call Maria&#8221; it will set an alarm for an hours time. Google has had voice dictation for ages, and is now available offline, so it can do all of that (email and texting). Generally it does it quicker as well.</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t do the schedule an appointment phrase, it fact it doesn&#8217;t seem to want to set appointments with the calendar at all (ie the reminder is set with an alarm not a calendar appointment),. Could be a patent issue, maybe just haven&#8217;t worked out the right implementation&#8230;. who knows these days. It does at least still give you the card for your next appointment , and the reminder to leave now with travel time is great.</p>
<p>Google Now has the voice recognition as well. It can and will do all sorts of those you mentioned.</p>
<p>To me, Google&#8217;s approach is an enhanced version of Siri. It has the info ready for you when you need it and can also take actions based on your need.</p>
<p>More importantly, it&#8217;s so much faster and works offline, too.  Since google has already pretty much everything of me, I am sure it will manager my life a lot of better than Siri, which I have to feed it every single time.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t schedule appointments using Google now or Reminders that are not on the same day.</p>
<p>Google Now isn&#8217;t search.  Google now is adaptive based off of previous search history but it runs in the background, and learns and evolves as you use it. <br />
Driving yesterday I swiped up and Google Now gave me the weather in my current town (Manhasset Long Island) and the time to my home location, noting that there were 3 minute delays along the way.  <br />
It was there for me at aswipe. I didn&#8217;t ask, it anticipated what I might want. A good assistant, but definitely not search.  Last night when I used it it showed me the current score of the Yankees game, which was going on live.</p>
<p>Google Now isn&#8217;t an active process. That is still searching with some pleasant looking cards for results.  It aggregates the info into from previous searches and will provide it when it think appropriate.</p>
<p>Does it help me add an appointment to my calendar, not really. But it will tell me when I swipe it if I will be late due to traffic. Or if my plane is delayed, or traffic will mean me arriving late etc.</p>
<p>Often overlooked (and sadly so, because we are far to easily giving it up nowadays) is that Google Now requires me to surrender my entire habits and life to Google, to be leveraged for other purposes. Siri requires me only to ask a question. Yes, Now is potentially great, but only if you&#8217;re willing to be wholly locked in for it. Also, if things like targeted ads, &#8220;suggested people&#8221; on G+, and similar algorithmic things through Google, FB, whatever that claim to be able to deduce relevant things to your interests and needs are any indication, it will quickly become more work to curate than it&#8217;s usefulness provides (and most people probably won&#8217;t notice). I will always know better what I want and am looking for than any algorithm will be able to deduce. I&#8217;m uncommonly idealistic in my views of what technology should do for us, and at what cost to our own personal value.</p>
<p>Me to so I have a my Android attached to a dummy acct. and I don&#8217;t use facebook..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to sell you or anyone else on it.  I simply stated it wasn&#8217;t search it was more akin to a predictive assistant. Your comparison seemed to misunderstand what it is and what it was actually was doing.<br />
I am a deep rooted nerd, and find interest in all things tech. My Location services are turned off except for during the three day test and it surprised me by giving quick access to useful information.  It surprised me that it was useful. (for me)</p>
<p>I use twitter and RSS and a few other tools to help scour news sources daily in an an effort to reduce the time it takes me to get the information I am seeking. Google Now is just another tool that can reduce the effort for certain tasks. Sure I could go outside, check a thermometer, thumb through a farmers almanac for historical weather patterns and protect my privacy or it can be pushed information.</p>
<p>I use an iPad and Android devices and soon a Nexus 7. I am well aware that both are tracking me out the ass.</p>
<p>if Google Now was an assistant.. it would have a fresh hot cup of coffee with just the right amount of sugar and cream in it ready for you when you entered the office.. and on fridays it would know you wanted a bagel with it. NO CREAM CHEESE.</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t hear about the food card in Google Now?</p>
<p>Never seen a better setup for a sudo make me a sandwich joke. Yet, no one did. Maybe it was TOO obvious.</p>
<p>Mate, you failed to understand one thing: if you decided to take advantage of either of these two technology, you will be tracked up anyways. If you hire a personal assistant, you will still need to tell her your work, your life and habit. For this case, instead of telling everything to a real person, you just tell to Google. That&#8217;s tradeoff. You cannot have a good assistant experience without telling anything about you. Nothing can come from nowhere and know what you like.</p>
<p>The difference between Google Now and Siri is one requires you to ask every single time, and the other one has the info ready for you already without you even openning your mouth.</p>
<p>You understand that this is Google, right? Google isn&#8217;t a new service they&#8217;re launching. People can already Google. There&#8217;s millions of hits every day already. It&#8217;s not slowing down.</p>
<p>Two things to remember -</p>
<p>First &#8211; Google&#8217;s back-end is second to none &#8211; they already deal with millions of users all the time in search and scale beautifully.</p>
<p>Second &#8211; Google&#8217;s voice recognition has been shrunk and can fit on the device &#8211; thus will likely fall to sending voice data to the cloud only when it fails locally.</p>
<p>Siri is a 3rd party acquisition that Apple has done very nice things with &#8211; but they do not have the back-end information that Google already has and they do not have the voice recognition expertise in-house that Google has &#8211; Nuance I believe still handles a lot of the voice stuff for Apple.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s voice, according to my understanding (and I might be wrong here) &#8211;  was developed in-house and was available in Android before Siri.</p>
<p>Siri is basically something that combines stuff from multiple vendors &#8211; Nuance, Wolfram, Google, Yelp and the like &#8211; and puts a shiny wrapper around it. It is a lot less integrated than what Google has &#8211; and all you need to do is look at a classic PC vendor that buys the CPU from a vendor, the OS from another, the memory from another etc&#8230; and assembles it all together to understand that there are real limits to how much you can push these together.</p>
<p>Apple will have to bring an awful lot of these pieces in-house to really keep up with Google as time goes on, one suspects.</p>
<p>Regarding your &#8220;win for the consumer&#8221; remark &#8212; I whole-heartedly agreed.  I was annoyed with Apple thinking they were &#8220;years ahead&#8221; with the Siri technology because it made me think that they would drag their feet with updates.  Indeed there were things the old Siri app could do that iPhone 4S Siri can only do in iOS 6 (e.g.: book a table, pull up movie times).  The old Siri app could even buy you movie tickets which I did not see in Apple&#8217;s iOS 6 demonstration (perhaps the partner for movie ticket purchases is still under negotiation).</p>
<p>I love that Google is taking on Apple on this front because it will light a fire under Apple to improve the performance (especially by moving some of the processing from the server to the device &#8212; at least I hope).</p>
<p>Nothing like having an iPhone 3GS that could voice-dial without a data network and an iPhone 4S that cannot with Siri turned on.  Worst scenario is when I get in the car from home and need to call somebody as I am driving away.  The iPhone 4S is still on WiFi because I am in my garage or driveway, but if I attempt to use Siri, it will lose the WiFi signal before it completes and Siri will tell me to try again.  I have to wait until I see the cellular network activate to try again because it no longer processes &#8220;Call Dave&#8221; on the device.  It should handle things like &#8220;Call [Name]&#8221; or &#8220;Call My Wife&#8221; or &#8220;Call My Brother&#8221; or &#8220;Call Home&#8221; without the server (I do like that Siri knows how contacts are related to me).</p>
<p>My other gripe with iOS 5 was along the same lines.  While I use and love WiFi sync to iTunes, when I place the iPhone in my car cradle and start the car it begins charging.  It then tries to sync with iTunes because it is still on WiFi, but in a matter of seconds it will no longer be on WiFi and the sync will fail.  iOS recovers nicely from this, but I wish I could tell it to wait until it is sitting on the charger with WiFi for a full minute before initiating an iTunes sync.</p>
<p>Now this video is great, as the guy is asking questions most other people haven&#8217;t. Didn&#8217;t know the new voice search was this good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used me both and I got to say I still think Siri works better than JB google search on my galaxy nexus, but that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>Who of all the posters with tech boners has actually used Now?</p>
<p>To me it sounds like all those other personal assistants that know what you want to do before you say it that came before it. They were all huge failures. Why should this be any different.</p>
<p>Now will be hit and miss &#8211; sometimes it shows you useful stuf, other times it adds to the noise. Even if it was 90% correct people would get annoyed and turn if off; and I dont think its going to be anywhere near 90%.</p>
<p>for voice recognition and search, sure, but the AI features are not going to work. As for SIRI &#8211; it was pretty bold to include natural language processing and even though its better than anything before it, people have complaints. But Apple did the right thing limiting its scope to small, useful things where AI can help and be a net positive.</p>
<p>Business Insider is trollish trash. Anyone who posts a link from there should be ashamed of themselves, regardless of the content.</p>
<p>Let me think about that.</p>
<p>Let me think about that.</p>
<p>Let me think about that.</p>
<p>Let me think about that.</p>
<p>Let me think about that.</p>
<p>As an iOS user, I have said it before, and I will say it again.  Siri&#8217;s biggest problem (actually a regression from the old voice control) is that it ALWAYS uses the server to figure out what you have said.  This adds a lag time in between question and response that is sometimes annoying.</p>
<p>Setting reminders, timers, and managing calendar is great with Siri.  Asking natural language questions is hit or miss.  Dieter&#8217;s review highlights some of the advantages and disadvantages to Google&#8217;s solution.  To me the biggest advantage is the local handling of voice interpretation regarding speed.  Apple needs to add this back into their voice control solution because it just makes things snappier.  This issue may diminish as Apple builds out more data centers and starts shipping LTE devices which have less latency, but there is something to be said for on-device voice interpretation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the only on device interpretation in Jelly Bean is dictation, not anything in Now</p>
<p>I think Google Now is also contacting the server as its offline voice recognition is not nearly as accurate as its remote recognition.  Would be nice to find out. Perhaps they&#8217;re using a hybrid solution, but my bet would be that it&#8217;s all server based.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case then the speed difference is likely attributable to:</p>
<p>1) Apple&#8217;s needs to quickly beef up their cloud presence to increase response time.  They are slowly doing this with new data centers planned in Oregon and Reno, Nevada.  All I can say is &#8220;more&#8221; &#8212; no better way to spend that $100B in cash.</p>
<p>2) Galaxy Nexus has low-latency 4G LTE and iPhone 4S does not, meaning that server round-trip is much faster on the Galaxy Nexus.  Though putting both on WiFi should create a level playing field.</p>
<p>Speed difference is also attributable to Siri&#8217;s reluctance to search the web since they don&#8217;t contract to have a directly integrated web search &#8212; they instead launch Safari.  From a user perspective, having Google as a provider just as Wolfram Alpha or Yelp would make the most sense.  Google is just really good and fast at search &#8212; there has never been any denying of that.</p>
<p>some do, not my HSPA+ version!</p>
<p>but that&#8217;s a great point. I would hope for the sake of their tests, they would both be on wifi, same dns, etc.</p>
<p>This test was conducted with both phones on Wi-Fi and Siri is still beaten rather easily so it&#8217;s definitely not related to cell network data transfer speeds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw-RzN4xYyE&feature=relmfu">YouTube Link</a></p>
<p>Then its a reflection of Google&#8217;s experience with parsing and interpreting search queries quickly as well as Siri&#8217;s reluctance to do a Web search because (heaven forbid) that would take you to Google.</p>
<p>Too bad Apple does not contract with Google as one of its Siri providers. :)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it. So Siri never searches on Google?</p>
<p>Unless you say &#8220;Search the Web for XYZ&#8221;, Siri will only search the Web as a last resort.  It first tries Yelp!, Wolfram Alpha, and a few other sources depending on your query.  Sources could be &#8220;Find my Friends&#8221; if you ask &#8220;Where is My Wife?&#8221; or it could be your calendar or your SMS messages or your email.  If Siri can&#8217;t find what you need it will ask you &#8220;Do you want me to search the Web for XYZ?&#8221;  When Siri searches the Web there is no pretty card for the response &#8212; it just launches Safari with whatever default search engine you have configured and inputs your query in the search box and executes it.</p>
<p>So if your intent is to search the Web, Siri is slower because it has to launch Safari and you have to specifically tell it to &#8220;search the web&#8221; unless you want to answer Siri&#8217;s follow-up question.</p>
<p>If Siri had specially designed cards that were fed by Google, Bing and Yahoo (similar to Wolfram Alpha and Yelp!) then Siri would be faster and more seamless at searching the Web.  The three potential Web search engines on iOS are Google, Yahoo and Bing (you configure your favorite in settings, but default is Google since Google paid for that right).</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus used for testing NOW does not have 4G LTE. It&#8217;s the pentaband GSM version with 3G.</p>
<p>While I dont think Now will work very well there is one thing that Google does better than anyone else on the planet: Build fast servers. Have you ever observed the speed of the typeahead on google.com? Its uncanny &#8211; its crazy fast, faster than should be allowed given my lag.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, still has got to figure all that stuff out, and besides its not core to their business so maybe their servers will never be as good as Googles.</p>
<p>That guys videos are really good. Thanks for the link.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get this guy, he&#8217;s the only person who says Google Now isn&#8217;t as good as Siri. Hell most people are blown away by how impressive Google Now is compared to Siri.</p>
<p>Which iPhone do you have?</p>
<p>Yup.  Also lags on web browsers, Facebook, etc.</p>
<p>Oh god yes. I was trying to show Facebook to my Android fanboy friends and the damn app kept crashing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not apples fault its facebooks fault. They have one of the poorest apps avalible in the app store. The one for the iPhone always crashes.  The iPad version crashes less but it still sucks.</p>
<p>What about Safari?  That&#8217;s not Apple&#8217;s fault?</p>
<p>We werent talking about safari. We are talking the Facebook app. Plus safari doesnt lag on my new iPad.</p>
<p>&#8230;and anyhow, Chrome is so sweet. I have plenty of Apple hardware products, but I have a full integration of Google services. They know software(cloud) for sure. Now I have to JB my iPhone (again) so I can make Chrome my default browser.</p>
<p>Safari lags on my new iPad. it&#8217;s annoying as hell.</p>
<p>As soon as I touched reply button to rebook you for saying &#8211; Safari crashes, it crashed for me for the very first time in about 3 months or so, I&#8217;m on iPad.<br />
On a different note, Angry Bird Seasons is crashing extremely frequently on 4S. Any other user facing issues with games &amp; Game Centre sync ?</p>
<p>Something must be wrong with your iPad.  I&#8217;ve yet to see a tablet that is as smooth with its browser than Safari is on any version of iPad.</p>
<p>It may be the best out there. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t possibly ever lag.</p>
<p>safari doesn&#8217;t lag but it constantly freezes on heavy sites that has flash. What&#8217;s funny is that it doesn&#8217;t even play flash!</p>
<p>Adobe Flash is not supported in Jelly Bean either <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3125219/flash-mobile-android-4-1-not-supported" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3125219/flash-mobile-android-4-1-not-supported</a></p>
<p>but works great!</p>
<p>It is supported. It just won&#8217;t offer you a download in the Play Store. You will still be able to download it from Adobe.</p>
<p>for now</p>
<p>No. It&#8217;s not supported by Adobe. Hence, not supported. Adobe won&#8217;t be developing new versions for mobile, and won&#8217;t be releasing to any Jellybean devices. Though it does currently work, which is what I think you meant to say.</p>
<p>Honestly I get more crashes on my iDevices (iPod Touch, iPad and iPhone) then I do with the 100 apps I have on my Nexus.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re full of shit. What iOS devices do you have. Which apps crash and which 100 apps on your gnex don&#8217;t crash?</p>
<p>facebook, flipboard, instagram, safari, pulse constantly crashes on my iDevice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had one App crash on my iPhone 4s</p>
<p>Yeah my iPhone is doing pretty good.</p>
<p>Safari crashes frequently when opening heavy sites (like theverge)<br />
Many apps that use the webview engine, or whatever it&#8217;s called, like flipboard crash often too.<br />
And when Safari is not crashing it suffers from severe checkerboarding, which I find way more annoying than a little bit of lag.<br />
I know it may be difficult to accept for you but yes, iDevices do crash and they do lag.</p>
<p>Severe checkerboarding?  iOS does not even use the checkerboard as of iOS 5.</p>
<p>I am talking about the effect (as in redrawing) , not necessarily the actual checkerboard pattern. Thought that would be obvious.</p>
<p>In last one hour, I&#8217;ve got Safari to crash on new iPad. And Game Centre &amp; Angry Bird Seasons to crash on 4S !!!<br />
What&#8217;s your point ? Just trollin&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Since you want to me repeat myself. I have the iPod Touch 4G, New iPad, and iPhone 4. All running the 5.1.1. The iPod has around 100 apps, the iPad around 50 apps and the iPhone has 26 apps.</p>
<p>I said that I get MORE crashes on my iDevices not that apps on my Nexus don&#8217;t crash.</p>
<p>Do you also want some screen shots or a picture Mr. Denial?</p>
<p>Also I do have the right to buy whatever I want.</p>
<p>This is pretty bizarre considering I have the new iPad and an iPhone 4 and can count the number of crashes I see in a month on one hand. I use both daily.</p>
<p>1. Do you also use a Nexus also?</p>
<p>2. I don&#8217;t remember having an app crash on my Nexus in over a month.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had an app crash on my iPhone or iPad in a month either.<br />
Perception. Anecdotes, etc.</p>
<p>thats cause you arent using it&#8230; besides for 10mins to read your book before you sleep, and if you are using it, then you arent using much. My sisters iPad crashed 3 times in 3 differnt apps in less than 30mins. She put it down and grabbed her HP TX2000 and did everything in Windows.</p>
<p>That would have been entirely believable if you&#8217;d withheld the last sentence :-P</p>
<p>Hahaha.  Windows.</p>
<p>So your another person who doesn&#8217;t use a Gnex everyday like me, yet you think that you can compare your situation to mine.</p>
<p>Please, point out where I mentioned the nexus at all.</p>
<p>Thats the whole point, I am speaking as someone who has experience with both. I&#8217;m not one of those fanboys who claim that their (insert name) is superior but have no idea how the other stuff works and how it just might be better. I also own a WP7 for fun.</p>
<p>I made no claims of superiority or any implications about the performance of a Nexus. I only pointed out that your anecdotal evidence is no more or less valuable than my equal anecdotal experience. I have used all the platforms though, and they all have their relative strengths, and they are all equally prone to instability, as any computing platform is.</p>
<p>Also, if you have to try so hard to let everyone know you&#8217;re not a fanboy, then you&#8217;re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Hey, if you don&#8217;t get a crash notification it didn&#8217;t crash, right?</p>
<p>LOL, yeah right.</p>
<p>i can&#8217;t i&#8217;ve seen this either, and i run the iOS beta&#8217;s. Generally, there is less over all lag still to this day (even with my sg2 and gnex)</p>
<p>it&#8217;s also about touch response time (something addressed somewhat with butter).</p>
<p>Obvious troll is obvious.Stupidity of android user is unthinkable</p>
<p>Ha, I&#8217;m not sure if someone with the username &#8220;Androidsucks&#8221; is allowed to call anyone else a troll. Reminds me of ol&#8217; &#8220;Blackberryhater&#8221; on Engadget&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120964/facebook-objective-c-app" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120964/facebook-objective-c-app</a></p>
<p>beat ya:D</p>
<p>actually, while fb is a terrible HTML app, it&#8217;s not totally their fault. Apple should have let 3rd party applications use nitro by now, which would speed up a ton of stuff in the FB app by about 300%.</p>
<p>objective c ftw tho.</p>
<p>Great point actually. The blame can be put everywhere. But at the end of the day I cae about a good experience.</p>
<p>So, when programs on Windows crash, or cause a BSOD people whinge endlessly about how its Microsofts fault.  When programs on iOS crash constantly, its the programmers fault, not Apple.</p>
<p>Excellent.  Well, until its Safari, Mail crashing then who is at fault? ooo,mmaybe the camera app, thats great when it dies.   Usually at the most inopportune moments.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just as bad on Android.  Doesn&#8217;t crash, per say, but it&#8217;s quite freakin slow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry for being a grammar nazi, but it&#8217;s <em>per se</em>. It&#8217;s Latin for <em>in itself</em>.</p>
<p>If you want your phone to look bad &#8211; show someone the facebook app. It&#8217;s suckiness is platform agnostic buddy.</p>
<p>Device are you using .. ? <br />
I&#8217;ve had a 3rd gen iPod touch, iPhone 4, 4S, iPad 2&#8217; new iPad, and rarely get any lag.</p>
<p>One of the smoothest things on iOS is safari. Obviously if they&#8217;re older devices, you&#8217;re goings to  more lag using newer software</p>
<p>In my house, I have, 2nd gen ipod touch, 4th gen iPod touch, iPhone 4, iPhone4S and two iPad2&#8217;s</p>
<p>All of them lag at points.   Not consistent.  Safari can be a pig, especially on The Verge.  iPod Touch 4th gen&#8217;s are slow as dirt.</p>
<p>Yes&#8230; Yet my GNex scrolls through the same sized music collection much smother than my &#8220;new iPad&#8221;. I describe that scroll behaviour &#8211; sand in my eyes.</p>
<p>Same for me. IOS lags in certain areas still, but it&#8217;s no big thing. Android and iOS deal with limited hardware and have to use tricks to compensate for it. It works find in 70 % of the time and in the rest it lags and stutters. Personally I find ICS (CM9)  on my SGS II more fluid and less laggy than iOS on my iPad 2, but both are fine to use.</p>
<p>my sg2 is no where near as smooth as my iPad 2 (jailbroken and running about 20 dylibs) It&#8217;s night and day.</p>
<p>And jellybean? You know, the topic of this article?</p>
<p>Actually it less less to do with ICS vs. Jellybean and more with Samsung screwing up the experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running AOKP on my SGS2 with the right touchscreen settings (thresholds not! altered by Samsung) and it&#8217;s definitely smoother and faster than any iDevice.</p>
<p>And that is only ICS&#8230; hard to imagine how Jellybean could be better.</p>
<p>sorry for replying to someone who has the same phone as me with an experience i had.</p>
<p>sigh. </p>
<p>Jesse you bitter old goat, take it stride like you normaly do&#8230; oh wait you never take anything in stride&#8230; you know you want JB in its official form&#8230;</p>
<p>i&#8217;ll be getting it earlier than most (my gnex is straight from google) I can&#8217;t comment on how buttery butter is until then:D</p>
<p>and i&#8217;ve admitted i was wrong at least 10 times on this forum, it happens to us all, but i&#8217;m not a old goat. Maybe a middle aged one.</p>
<p>He said CM9/ICS. You might be still on Gingerbread, or Samsung&#8217;s butchered version of ICS.</p>
<p>My iPad2 lags a lot, all over, my GNex, on ICS, not too much but still present. I don&#8217;t know why people claim iOS doesn&#8217;t lag&#8230;</p>
<p>i have both those devices, and find it to be just about the opposite of what you said. It&#8217;s noticeable too, so idk.</p>
<p>interesting&#8230;.</p>
<p>yup. Don&#8217;t think your lying or anything, could be perceived perception, could be that i&#8217;m more sensitive to input lag, and your more sensitive to transition lag. (they are very different)</p>
<p>input lag imo, is the most by far important. A button not registering when you click it is infuriating, on any platform.</p>
<p>Roger that. I think this is the first time I have ever agreed with you&#8230; good to see we can agree. :D</p>
<p>i&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be the last. I love my android products, i would say i have more android devices than 95+ % of the android enthusiasts here. That&#8217;s not going to make me lie about my experiences:D</p>
<p>I have a new found level of respect for you now.</p>
<p>I have terrible lag on my iPhone 4, and my 3G before it.  iPad 3 has been pretty good so far.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m constantly being told by tech pundits that iOS devices don&#8217;t lag, so I guess the 1 to 5 second delay between hitting my unlock code keys and their black dots showing up on screen is just a hallucination!  I don&#8217;t remember it starting out that way, though. I think I remember them all being slick as snot for the first few weeks.<br />
This is why I personally suspect that it has to do with what you have installed on your device.  Probably related to the number of push notifications and/or background processes.  Not solely dependent, of course, but related.</p>
<p>Like most things, as they age, they slow Down. This is probably the majority of your problem.</p>
<p>I would&#8217;ve thought so, too&#8230; except I&#8217;ve restored from scratch several times.  Once when the iOS 5 upgrade wrecked everything, once when I tried jailbreaking (wasn&#8217;t happy with the experience), and once when I turned myself back in to jail (see previous).  It was never as slick as it was at the beginning, but in each case, I immediately reloaded my crap-ton of apps and notifications.  Push notifications on two email accounts, numerous social networks, and a number of games.</p>
<p>Sounds like there is something wrong with your iphone</p>
<p>My iphone 4 is jailbroken &amp; never re-installed now 2 years old, and no lag whatsoever.</p>
<p>Could it be whatever tat You and Nexi have on your respective devices? e.g Live wallpapers = SLOW for Android a lot of the time.</p>
<p>Perception bias<br />
It exists all over<br />
just look at the completely different anecdotal posts all over this thread</p>
<p>My experience is that its a different lag between iOS and Android.  iOS stalls at times when you are launching an app or first unlocking the phone.  Android tends to lag when something is being animated and something else wants to be processed in the background.</p>
<p>In iOS the UI rendering takes precedence, but when something has to load or the device has to be brought back from sleep there can be a noticeable stall.  My experience is that most iOS lags are on the lock screen.  Sometimes I go to slide a lock-screen notification and nothing happens because the UI is not ready for me yet (still waking up from sleep).  Same goes with the standard slide-to-unlock bar on my iPhone 4S.  Once the wakeup occurs, things are typically smooth since UI rendering tends to successfully override anything else I am doing 99.9% of the time.</p>
<p>Android&#8217;s project butter sounds like it was about figuring out which background processing were overriding UI rendering and fixing that.  iOS has had that sort of optimization since inception.  iOS struggles more as it tries to fight between putting things to sleep to conserve battery life and making them be instantly available &#8212; unloading an app means having to reload it to use it again.  Android typically sacrifices some of the battery life to keep things always running and ready to go.  Keeping things running and ready to go can also expose you to third-party app bugs that could crash things unexpectedly.  Shutting down a third-party app limits its ability to crash in the background and screw something else up.  There are trade offs to each, just like their are trade offs between buying a Porsche and a Ferrari &#8212; either way you still get a great car (or gadget) in the end.</p>
<p>Well said. While I dont have lag on my iphone i am developing iphone apps and so I am acutely aware of all the tricks one needs to employ to get a non-laggy app. The thing that ios nails is the drawing pipeline, and that was awesome from day one &#8211; opengl rendering all the way, and it shows.</p>
<p>Project butter is the reason i am going to consider android devices again going forward. Tried a few brand new Samsung top end models in the mall and the stuttering is both obvious and unacceptable. Only the SGS 3 seemed a little better. I know theres no reason hardware side for this to happen, its all software. With Butter Google has actually got some people with game experience on board, people who understand and care about FPS. Cool!!</p>
<p>People are usually comparing iOS to Android when they say it &#8220;doesn&#8217;t lag&#8221;.  it&#8217;s all about perspective.  I find scrolling in any Android browser (haven&#8217;t tried Jellybean) to be distinctly less responsive to scrolling in Safari on similar hardware.</p>
<p>As an aside for why that happens &#8211; iOS will stop loading the webpage while you scroll (touch takes precedence), whereas Android continues to render it (touch is equal). Not necessarily better or worse, but that&#8217;s probably what you&#8217;re seeing.</p>
<p>True.. But internals wise the newest ipad is pushing waaaay more pixels and has less brute force hardware then the nexus.</p>
<p>The new iPad is months newer, and using a better CPU. I fail to see the &#8216;less brute force hardware&#8217;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tablet pushing a crazy high resolution. 2048×1536 px 264 PPI</p>
<p>And the cpu is only slightly faster and it has 1gb of ram. The gnex basically has the same internals and isnt pushing near that many pixels. For god sakes look what they had to put in the nexus 7 to make jb run smooth.</p>
<p>thedifference in the number of pixels in the Nexus 7 vs. the Galaxy Nexus is negligible</p>
<p>Not sure where you&#8217;re going there, the N7 has no hardware that isn&#8217;t common place now.</p>
<p>The iPad uses a Dual Core CPU  with Quad Core GPU with and 1GB of RAM<br />
vs<br />
The GNEX with a Dual Core CPU on 308MHZ GPU and 1GB of RAM</p>
<p>These two aren&#8217;t the same.</p>
<p>I think he means they both have a dual core cpu and video chipsets, in a tablet form&#8230; thats where he thinks they are the same hardware&#8230;</p>
<p>i kid&#8230;</p>
<p>No one puts a gun in Apple&#8217;s head and force them to jam so many redundant pixels that human eye can&#8217;t even see at normal distance. Apple did it for marketing, little else. Furthermore, Apple has the luxury of tweaking cpu build, not Google.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not for marketing. They are quite easy on the eyes.</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 4 (326 ppi) and a 1st generation iPad (132 ppi). The difference in legibility between them is like night and day, especially for extended periods of time. Getting displays to a pixel density that mimics print is way more than just marketing. If you&#8217;re going to sell a device whose primary functions include reading long-form content at close range, resolution matters. A lot. I actually spend more time reading my news feeds on my iPhone than I do on my iPad because the screen on the phone is just so much easier on my eyes.</p>
<p>Resolution isnt so much the key as it would be ppi for laser printer quality.</p>
<p>I have an iPad 2 and my wife uses an iPhone 4S &#8211; and quite frankly &#8211; I do not see the difference as that big of a deal. It might be different for other people &#8211; but for me &#8211; the retina display is not a big deal.</p>
<p>FWIW &#8211; I no longer use an iPhone and moved to a Lumia 900 with a pitiful resolution &#8211; but I find it&#8217;s screen to be better than the iPhone&#8217;s  because of that anti-glare filter. I can use the Lumia all the time &#8211; even in direct sun-light with my sun-glasses, the iPhone is a lot harder to use in these conditions.</p>
<p>I understand it is different for everyone &#8211; but for me, the crazy resolutions on the latest iDevices and Macs are not that useful.</p>
<p>You must be one of those people who turns their desktop monitor resolution down to 800&#215;600.</p>
<p>And immediately maximizes every window even on a very high resolution monitor so there is 9 inches of white space on either side of every web page.</p>
<p>Ugh not the &#8220;marketing&#8221; thing.  Really?  You might as well say Project Butter is &#8220;marketing&#8221;, at least Apple didn&#8217;t need to come up with a buzzword for having a non-laggy UI.</p>
<p>Because they haven&#8217;t a non-laggy UI?</p>
<p>Are you serious? &#8220;new iPad&#8221; has a GPU that has 2-3x more raw power than Tegra3. The CPU is slower, but pixels are pushed by the GPU, not CPU.</p>
<p>Also GNex is about 4 times slower than &#8220;new iPad&#8221; and 2 times slower than iPhone4S, on GPU front.</p>
<p>Better CPU, no. Better GPU yes, which is what it needs to push those pixels.</p>
<p>A higher pixel count does not exempt them from scrutiny. Just because it has more pixels does not mean the user experience should suffer &#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing it doesn&#8217;t suffer. iOS5 runs very well on the new iPad. I&#8217;m not sure what people are referring to in terms of lag.</p>
<p>In terms of lag, I am fairly certain that there is nothing to bicker about. However, if I purchased an iPad 3, I would surely think that games would perform better compared to the iPad 2. (see <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/26/3019105/retina-display-new-ipad-graphics)" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/26/3019105/retina-display-new-ipad-graphics)</a></p>
<p>Of course &#8220;better&#8221; is subjective as it&#8217;s a battle between more details vs. more pixels.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to take out the last &#8220;)&#8221; after the URL for it to work.</p>
<p>My comment above applies to you. User experience is much better compared to android especially with the hardware they use to accomplish it with. look at the nexus 7 compared to the ipad 3 for example.</p>
<p>As I saw in this review, the user experience is on par with iOS in terms of lag.</p>
<p>UX does not care about the hardware it is running on. It does not matter if it took little hardware to make things smooth or a powerhouse to accomplish the same. This is all invisible to the user.</p>
<p>Technically the level of integration of Nexus devices aren by no means less than that of iOS devices. Each version of Android built is designed first for the Nexus device, then ported to all the other ones. If Google finally got the lag/smoothness issues down in JB, then by all means it should be just as good, if not better due to the decreased pixels and increased cores, than the New iPad.</p>
<p>Actually, the GPU in the A5X in the new iPad is faster than Tegra3&#8217;s GPU, same for CPU and memory bandwidth. GPU and Memory bandwidth matter most in hardware accelerated UI. People miss that fact&#8230;</p>
<p>The best comparison between iOS and JellyBean would be the iPhone 4 VS Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S1 (both are VERY similar, hardware-wise), with the iPhone 4 running the A4 chip and the SGS1 running the Hummingbird chip.</p>
<p>ICS is already comparable to iOS on my SGS1 (AOPK, no overclocking whatsoever, actually i&#8217;m using a conservative governer), I&#8217;d imaging it would be better than iOS while running JellyBean.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, scrolling in Safari on a complex web page does not appear to be any slower on a 3rd gen iPad vs the iPad 2.  The GPU is clearly enough to handle the additional pixels in that scenario.  In fact, I don&#8217;t know of anything the 3rd gen iPad is slower at graphically except 3d games trying to push the full resolution which we aren&#8217;t even discussing here.</p>
<p>not a good comparison, the SoC on the new iPad is better comparable to the Exynos 4 Quad (both CPU and GPU), not the OMAP 4 on the Nexus. If we&#8217;re talking GPU wise (which really what matters in hardware accelerated UI rendering), then the new iPad has a MUCH faster/powerful GPU. Again, it&#8217;s more comparable to Exynos. We&#8217;ll have to see how JellyBean runs on the Galaxy S3 for a good comparison.</p>
<p>No lag on the iPad 3 when loaded up and moving through the UI. If you are having problems backup and restore your iPad.</p>
<p>It lags when I launch Facebook. Also when scrolling to the top on most long pages.</p>
<p>Facebook isn&#8217;t iOS&#8217; fault. It&#8217;s the creators of the Facebook app. Just like how Tweetbot doesn&#8217;t lag for me.</p>
<p>Yes iOS is perfect. You are right. Anybody who disagrees is wrong the world needs someone upright like you call him &#8220;full of shit&#8221;. Thanks for being in the comments of evey single freaking article about Android to defend your religion.</p>
<p>No I just have to set people straight. Just like it isn&#8217;t googles fault that there are so many ugly android apps, it isn&#8217;t apply fault if people don&#8217;t code their apps correctly. There are different factors which reflect the performance of each thing and you can&#8217;t just look at one.</p>
<p>The browser lags quite a bit. App switching lags and stutters. Hell, just typing this comment on an iPad 2 and iOS 5 caused it to lag.</p>
<p>mike, you have an iPad 2? Over 3 screen names surely you would mention this?</p>
<p>Did you mis-reply? I have an iPad 2 and a GNexus, hoping to get a GSIII soon.</p>
<p>aren&#8217;t you mike / seppuku?</p>
<p>Who? WTF is up with you dude? You&#8217;ve been stalking me and calling me &#8220;mike&#8221; for quite a while, and now you&#8217;re surprised that I have different devices than whoever you think I am?</p>
<p>easy there tiger; i could be mistaken. I thought you were this guy because of similar writing styles / identical views, and your registration when he was banned. my apologies if your not.</p>
<p>This is a VERY disturbing post. Internet Stalking&#8230;</p>
<p>clicking on his profile is stalking? I guess i just stalked you too.</p>
<p>Wow. So you&#8217;re stalking me and analyzing my writing because you think I&#8217;m someone who was banned? Creeper much?</p>
<p>I dont see Jesse as a stalker, he is just very analytical. Truth on the other hand you are rather defensive all the time, and think everyone one is after you&#8230; trust me nothing is further from the truth.</p>
<p>Shhhh, truthisfree is the most objective, level headed user on this here website&#8230;</p>
<p>/s of course</p>
<p>.szszszszszszszszs&#8230; oh how it burns&#8230;</p>
<p>He just admitted to stalking my comments and analyzing my writing style. On an online forum.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t see anything slightly odd/stalkerish about that?</p>
<p>i think you need to get over yourself lol. Lookin to see when you registered is one click.</p>
<p>If you think that is stalking, (apart from the desperation in your attacks against me) then you might want to go offline. This isn&#8217;t stalking.</p>
<p>again, and truthfully: get over yourself.</p>
<p>The fact that you remember when a user was banned and compared it to another user&#8217;s registration date is evidence enough that you take this way too seriously. Projection dude, you&#8217;re doing it.</p>
<p>the fact that you&#8217;ve elevated this to this level just says your attacking from the defense. You should calm down, and again, get over yourself.</p>
<p>also; to be clear: i don&#8217;t know when seppuku was banned. I just know that a loud presence was replaced with another loud presence.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not the only one who thinks you&#8217;re Mike.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to set us straight, we made our choice of OS so let us live with it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re like an annoying pastor trying to get people into his church.</p>
<p>Agreed, it really isn&#8217;t Apple&#8217;s fault that the FB app lags. iOS has been more stable for me than ICS on my SGSII.</p>
<p>dude, I don&#8217;t know about you but I am experiencing serious lags when going to the spotlight search screen.</p>
<p>Yep. I bought a 3rd gen iPad for work (I&#8217;m porting an iOS app to Android), and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Things still lag, and the OS isn&#8217;t as intuitive as people make it out to be relative to Android (in fact, I&#8217;d argue Android 4.0+ is easier to use). Another place of terrible lag is the Game Centre.</p>
<p>Game Center is notorious.  iBooks is a debacle as well as the new Podcasts app.  Apple first-party apps are going downhill fast!</p>
<p>Thats cause the lead software designer has left the company, and the hardware designer is leaving too.</p>
<p>Not only does it lag, but it lags while doing LESS than Android does.</p>
<p>I have both and ICS Tegra2 tablet (for a year) and the new iPad (for 3 months). I can only speak to ICS, but its lag is very very noticeable. I have not noticed any lag on the new iPad in 3 months of using it.</p>
<p>What until a few more months.  With each iOS update, the previous device gets laggier and laggier until it&#8217;s unusable.</p>
<p>My iPad 1 suffered a slight bit with its first OS update.  It was very noticeable around the iPad 2 release.  And now with iPad 3 out, it&#8217;s unusable.  If you read the reviews on lots of first party apps, iPad 3 is starting to feel the effects.  Just a warning&#8230;</p>
<p>I hear you, my iphone 4 hasn&#8217;t been the same since ios5. Probably going to hold off on updating to ios6 incase the same problems with the iphone 3g to ios4 happens. That was some pretty bad lag.</p>
<p>My iPad 1 is basically unusable.  I constantly force close apps and restore but I can barely scroll across home pages.</p>
<p>You know, it would probably be more useful with iDroid installed :V</p>
<p>The iPad 1 is in trouble, it&#8217;s the most RAM starved iOS device.  Which is one reason why it&#8217;s probably not getting iOS 6 and isn&#8217;t all that amazing with 5.</p>
<p>thats probably because you have 30 apps open in the background&#8230;</p>
<p>Not possible with iOS.</p>
<p>Sorry, but iOS crushes Android in terms of lag. Most notably, touch inputs. My Galaxy Nexus was beautiful, but just didn&#8217;t respond as well to scrolling and inputs as my iPhone 4S. It looks like this difference was pretty obvious, as that&#8217;s Google&#8217;s major push for Jelly Bean (butter). <br />
I HAVE noticed that when there are a lot of apps open on the iPhone that keyboard inputs can get laggy. This is remedied by closing apps, but still obnoxious.</p>
<p>Sure it does. I believe you.</p>
iOS lags as well. Happens all the time on my iPhone 4. On the iPad 3, not so much. But I would hope so, considering it's hardware.
<p>It really doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve been running the developer preview version of JB on my SGN since last week and it&#8217;s completely smooth, 100% of the time.</p>
<p>So no more lag while accessing the recent apps list? How about pressing the Home button when you are on the four home screen panes that are not the main one? Pressing Back or Home from app drawer to return to the home screen is also liquid-smooth now too?</p>
<p>Um, yes. Did you watch the high speed camera video?</p>
<p>It really is much much smoother</p>
<p>it&#8217;s high speed slowd down&#8230;. Not the best way to demo non-laggy performance.</p>
<p>The point is to show the smooth frame rate. I guess we can agree to disagree, but I think it&#8217;s a pretty good way to show it.</p>
<p>I see where you&#8217;re coming from though. I would have showed real time performance in the video too though.</p>
<p>Probably less noticeable in real time since those animations they were showing are pretty quick. Speed is probably similar, but the smoothness (better framerate) at which animations happen make things more fluid.</p>
<p>Because a 30fps video can accurately show the 60fps Vsync&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never say that an OS is perfect but I just tried all those things on my JB Nexus and they are really sooth, noticeably smoother than before.  The only one that is ever iffy is recent apps when you are in a memory hogging app, sometimes there is a bit more lag than I would like.</p>
<p>Actually. Yes. That would be correct.</p>
<p>No offence but people said the sam thing when 4.0 launched. Even in Josh&#8217;s review, it specifically said lag was gone.</p>
<p>It still lags. As do other OS&#8217;s.</p>
<p>They all lag. It&#8217;s such a stupid thing to fight over. When it doesn&#8217;t lag people try to do more faster and then it just starts lagging again. There&#8217;s got to be something to talk about though, and they are making an effort to make things smoother.</p>

<p><strong>My Windows Phone never lags</strong>. It&#8217;s the smoothest out of all OS&#8217;es I have tried.</p>
<p>Also, since Google now themselves admitted that Android 4.0 performance sucks, will Josh admit too? Or will he continue denying it and IT WONT BE MENTIONED IN ANDROID 4.0 device reviews, like before.</p>
<p>Talk about double standards. Not once was lag mentioned in 4.0 devices review, Not once.</p>
<p>Now excuse me while I go back to my &#8220;old, and awful&#8221; OS</p>
<p>Improving on something doesnt mean the previous version was bad.  Why make improvements in the first place?  Nothing is perfect.  Even iOS or WP</p>
<p>Please point me where Google admitted 4.0 &#8220;performance sucks&#8221;</p>
<p>My take-away for that section was that the majority of the people are still on Gingerbread, which is a little disappointing.  This is unfortunate consequence of mixing Google rapid release with non-forced updates.</p>
<blockquote>with non-forced updates.</blockquote>
<p>kidding?</p>
<p>I own a Galaxy Nexus, and I&#8217;ll tell you exactly where. They showed it at Google IO. Click on a quick contact so that the little card comes up. Hit back to make it go away. Do I agree that it sucks? Hardly. And I don&#8217;t care how smooth WP7 is, having a lack of selection of applications is like buying a new computer. You can only us MS paint for so long.</p>
<p>ICS didn&#8217;t lag ; Jelly Bean is  just much more fluid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to get into the argument about lag, but you do realise your comment is an oxymoron?</p>
<p>For JB to be more fluid, ICS has to be less fluid, which by definition means it lags at least in part.</p>
<p>Nothing is perfect. Rather than a blanket ICS didn&#8217;t lag statement, I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s nothing wrong in admitting fault and say ICS barely lagged at all.</p>
<p>lag and stutter are not the same thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because Windows phone doesnt do multi-tasking properly.</p>
<p>But what about when neither device is running any 3rd party background apps (and just running the standard set of OS background processes and a front facing app?)</p>
<p>There is no excuse for you.</p>
<p>Trolololol.</p>
<p>Of course your Windows CE phone doesn&#8217;t lag &#8211; providing you don&#8217;t touch it, of course.</p>
<p>Well since Microsoft admitted that WP7 sucks, will you admit it too? (See? Two can play at that gem)</p>
<p>This is a pretty rotten, trollish comment. It sucks that you started the thread out in this manner. Please don&#8217;t do it again.</p>
<p>On a side note, I&#8217;m using a Galaxy Nexus with JB as my daily driver, and it&#8217;s incredibly smooth. Every mobile phone on the market — iPhones included — can lag from time to time. I don&#8217;t notice any prevalent issues, and I use my phone <em>a lot.</em></p>
<p>Watch out, badass, etc.</p>
<p>&#8230;and I think Google Voice Search (Jelly Bean) is way better then Siri !!!</p>

<p>Dude, we got it the first time. We got it the second time.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. You&#8217;ll notice that this guy has been trolling for months.</p>
<p>Yeah we&#8217;re looking into it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great to hear Josh, keeping trolls in check is essential to keeping the great level of discussions we have here at the Verge!</p>
<p>Also, the guy right above your post.</p>

<p>And thanks for keeping things awesome, Josh!</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t. Trolls suck. But freedom of expression on the internet is essential. So long as nobody is personally attacked, there&#8217;s no real harm. Censorship is a slippery slope!</p>
<p>Just keep pumping out the quality works and rise above it! Most of us appreciate it.</p>
<p>agree. </p>
<blockquote>Freedom of expression is essential. </blockquote>
<p>It sure is and he should express his stupidity somewhere else when the admins express their disapproval of this troll. The Verge =/ US Govt. The comment section for this article is now 95% filled with useless opinions that are entirely unrelated to the topic of the article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually using JellyBean on my Galaxy Nexus. I was hoping to find something useful or new about JellyBean that I hadn&#8217;t realized or read somewhere else. I stopped reading after the first 50+ comments were so pointless and unrelated to the article that I just started scanning the rest of the comment section for funny GIFs until I noticed Mr. Topolsky even had to chime in.</p>
<p>I admit that&#8217;s a problem, but banning people won&#8217;t solve it. He&#8217;ll just come back with a different username. The end result of banning someone will just be a more pissed off individual with a vendetta, who will return more trollish!</p>
<p>Generally I just scan down to first level comments, and if it&#8217;s a reasonable start, the comments are usually good.</p>
<p>If they would let us colapse the trollish discussions, this would keep them from banning people, while not letting the trollfests affect everyone that much!</p>
<p>Well said, also <strong>Dieter Bohn</strong> minor typo &#8220;The interface is looks like Android’s Holo theme&#8221;</p>
<p>That guy is an Apple fanboy/ troll. If he does continue to persist in this kind of attitude you should just suspend his account or something (as a last resort).</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll add the option to collapse all responds to a comment in a future version of the site. This way comment sections can&#8217;t get ruined like this.</p>
<p>The point is, Android now with jelly beans is noticeably smoother , that&#8217;s a huge leap forward from an OS that is known to be laggy. <br />
Small lags will always be present on such a sophisticated OS like Android . Heck even iOS that doesn&#8217;t even do the same level of multitasking lags from time to time (I should know because I am also an iphone owner). What is important is that the Laggy nature of Android is slowly becoming a history now. Android now is probably 90% smoother compared to when it was still on Froyo.</p>
<p>Only OS that doesn&#8217;t is WP for now.  I do however look forward to trying out jb on my gn</p>
<p>Congratulations.  You win the &#8220;troll of the day award&#8221;.  Your single first comment has effectively turned the entire first several pages of comments on this article into a tech fan argument about lagging.  Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; depending what you are doing, all devices can lag or stutter a bit.  Can we drop that and move on?</p>
<p>its still beta sir. Your beloved iOS is laggy and a finished sold product. Try again.</p>
<p>Trolling a troll isn&#8217;t helpful.</p>
<p>wasnt trying to troll I hate it when that happens&#8230; I was just trying to make a funny :( ill climb back into my sad panda hole&#8230;</p>
<p>we all get sucked into it sometimes. I&#8217;ve even been baited into an argument today lol. Just gotta keep trying.</p>
<p>The share menu lags because it scans the installed applications to see which ones should be displayed on the list. Then it picks up their icons and populates the list. If iOS had a share menu, it would make you wait on a Loading screen before the whole list is ready so that it does not lag when you are scrolling.</p>
<p>You expect 100% fluidity? You do no there is NO OS out there that has that kind of fluidity right?</p>
<p>And if you say iOS doesn&#8217;t lag well, hate to break it to you but it does.</p>
<p>Know what doesn&#8217;t lag? WP7</p>
<p>All comments below this one: Epic Burn to Bio10.</p>
<p>Scrolls like Project Butter.</p>
<p>D&#8217;OH!</p>
<p>I wonder if the Project Butter to reduce lag is a workaround for the limits within Android or a proper longterm fix. Seems an improvement though which was needed.</p>

<p>Dieter&#8230; Excellent. Thorough. Masterpiece. Good work!</p>
<p>Both Hands on the Keyboard Mmmkay?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m impressed with the updates on Jelly Bean 4.1. I hope Windows Phone 8 releases more information on their &#8216;unreleased&#8217; updates too!</p>
<p>This is a step ahead the current version of iOS.</p>
<p>Yes&#8230;that&#8217;s pretty much what was said in the article, which I doubt you or any of the fast trigger commenters above have actually read.</p>
<p>For me being the one not having read it, you still got here pretty quickly&#8230;</p>
<p>And yes, I just looked at the pictures and went straight to the comment section, that&#8217;s where the fun is.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t claim to have finished it and I didn&#8217;t comment on it as I haven&#8217;t read it, but I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that seconds after it was posted the lower right hand corner of my screen was already showing the fervent activity of trolls and attention seekers.</p>
<blockquote>I wish I could say that Android 4.1 is on par with iOS on an iPhone 4S when it comes to its reaction to my finger&#8217;s taps and swipes — but iOS still takes the crown here</blockquote>
<p>Wait&#8230; did you read the article?</p>
<p>There was way more to the article than reaction/speed.</p>
<p>Clearly you didn&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote>However, compared to what they bring to the table <strong>today</strong>, I think Jelly Bean is a stronger offering</blockquote>
<p>but by all means, keep the belief that as of yet unreleased software is way better than something people re using today.</p>
<p>I was under the impression JB wasn&#8217;t out yet either.</p>
<p>Yet, here&#8217;s a review&#8230;almost as if someone is using it right now! I&#8217;m shocked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the reviewer doesn&#8217;t have access to the iOS beta, yet still made his statement, but Ol&#8217; Nate up there is still clinging on to the hope of more as of yet unannounced features&#8230;which is nice, but a little strange.</p>
<p>if you had used the iOS 5 betas, or looked into the release cycles, you would see what he&#8217;s said has happened, multiple times in Apple&#8217;s history. They hold their cards.</p>
<p>Either way, they are both pre-release software.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funnier is comparing the &#8220;speed&#8221; as if an animation couldn&#8217;t just be cut.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that that&#8217;s what this boils down to: whose animation is the nicest.</p>
<p>There were a lot of Android users a couple of versions ago talking about how iOS was terrible because of the animations, and that their Android devices were better/faster because they didn&#8217;t animate at all. Google is now seeing the benefits of a more immersive UI through animation. These little details are the kind of things that Apple seems to get right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Yes, they realized that flashy pictures smooth over any perceived slowness. I don&#8217;t personally prefer it, but if it makes the &#8220;lag&#8221; trolling go away, so be it.</p>
<p>No, they don&#8217;t just smooth over any perceived slowness, it&#8217;s immersion. The user feels more engaged in the UI, not just covering up lag. The experience and perception that a user has of an interface while using is as important, if not more important than the static visual design of that interface.</p>
<p>Who cares? He can only compare and contrast that which is in his hands now. What is wrong with you? You&#8217;re expecting him to knock it for not having as of yet features he&#8217;s convinced iOS might have in the future?</p>
<p>what is wrong with me? All i said was don&#8217;t knock the guy for saying apple do things like that, cause they do.</p>
<p>what&#8217;s wrong with you? Hug?</p>
<p>I like how the verge deleted my comment. whatevs</p>
<p>Because you make a lot of technically clueless statements, that can be considered trolling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a step ahead of the next version of iOS too if what they showed of iOS6 is all there is to it. It&#8217;s especially upsetting because Apple rarely updates their stock apps and when they do,  it&#8217;s only at the end of hardware cycles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an Apple fan through  &amp; through, but I love Google&#8217;s typography in what I&#8217;ve seen of Jelly bean.</p>
<p>i was a big fan of droid sans, the first android font. I usually install it on my iOS devices too:D</p>
<p>I liked that Tron styling from Honeycomb which was otherwise a terrible OS.</p>
<p>I thought Honeycomb/ICS looked alright (on Moto Xoom, only experience)&#8230; different, certainly.  But after about two or three weeks, I found myself wanting to change the font and color scheme.</p>
<p>If you were to rate this update on a scale from 1-10 where would it fall?</p>
<p>As someone who has used it since it was leaked, I give it a 9 or 10 easily. ESPECIALLY for a prerelease.</p>
<p>As far as OS&#8217; go, Id give it a solid 8.5.  iOS would get around a 5.  WP7 would get around a 6.</p>
<p>HA</p>
<p>What you smokin homie?</p>
<blockquote>Another set features that&#8217;s sorely missing from Android: Find my phone, remote lock, and remote wipe. </blockquote>
<p>How do I access this?</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;that&#8217;s sorely missing</strong><br />
<strong>&#8221;sorely missing&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>&#8220;missing&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There are a lot of apps that do this, some of which are free. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidlost&feature=search_result">Android Lost</a> in case anyone is interested.</p>
<p>Seek Droid is my preference. I got it for free, but it&#8217;s a fantastic app (I think there&#8217;s a free version now anyhow).</p>
<p>Really can&#8217;t beat <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsdroid.cerberus&hl=en">Cerberus.</a> Remote lock/Wipe, record audio/video remotely, track phone, etc. And it is usable on multiple phones (up to 5) with one license.</p>
<p>doesn&#8217;t really makes sense to me if the device is stolen. what kind of thief keeps the phone on and does not throw out the SIM.</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s based on the phone ID, not the SIM. In fact, there is an alert that will automatically send you a notification (via email) if the SIM in the phone is replaced. The alert will include the device&#8217;s location, SIM info of the SIM inserted and can alert other phones to the SIM card change via text message.</p>
<p>Oh, I read that as &#8220;JB introduces features that have been missing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2/jtr.jpg" />I’m slightly confused by "Google now offers voice search capabilities." – My phone has Gingerbread and I’ve been using Google voice search on it since last December.

<p>&#8220;attack on lag&#8221; that camera app was lagging pretty hardcore in the video. I like how they took the filmstrip idea directly from wp.</p>
<p>From use, it appears to actually try to focus the shot before taking it &#8211; instead of the autofocus it used to have. I think this is more a fact of the ROM than anything.</p>
<p>True. I was just surprised with the claims google was making. Obviously the os is smoother but with the nexus shutter speed and project butter there should have been any lag there.</p>

<p>Android user: &#8220;I got JB!&#8221;<br />
iOS user: &#8220;You jailbroke your phone? cool!&#8221;</p>
<p>Android users don&#8217;t jailbreak their phone, they root it. But &#8220;A&#8221; for effort.</p>
<p>The point billyandika is making is that in iOS communities, jailbroken phones are referred to as JB, so the confusion can occur. I myself have already had this same interaction with an iOS-toting coworker.</p>
<p>Well, then the joke doesn&#8217;t make sense at all.</p>
<p>It makes sense, it just isn&#8217;t particularly funny.</p>
<p>Really!? Lol.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/8805103.jpg" /></p>
<p>In fact the practice has almost always been referred to as rooting. It only really began being called jailbreaking by iPhone users.</p>
<p>The term jailbreak was coined before the release of the first Android device. So the term rooting hasn&#8217;t &#8220;always&#8221; applied</p>
<p>Rooting = getting root*. It&#8217;s a linux/unix term and as such TOTES** predates iOS:<br />

<p>Android user ICS and JB only 9% <br />
iOS 5 user: 90%</p>
<p>The average Android user that cares about OS upgrades: 0%</p>
<p>Everyone cares about os upgrades. No one likes to not be up to date.</p>
<p>Really?  My wife is on Gingerbread right now.  She thinks the OS names are cute and know nothing of the features of the different versions. She would upgrade the OS if the if it&#8217;s pushed out by the carrier, but she&#8217;s not going to search it out.</p>
<p>Just because people don&#8217;t know or care doesn&#8217;t change the fact that all users deserve to be up to date if they can be.</p>
<p>Not saying people don&#8217;t deserve it, I believe everyone deserve the latest and greatest their phone offers. They just don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s out there.  Neither Google nor the carriers advertise on tv or send out emails when the next version of Android is out. Only people like us reading tech blogs care.</p>
<p>How is it a fact that all users deserve to be up to date? Did anyone ever sign a contract in receiving updates?</p>
<p>Ignorance is not the same</p>
<p>as?</p>
<p>as half finished thoughts posted to a web forum&#8230;apparently. LOL</p>
<p>Ignorance is not the same as not caring.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that people don&#8217;t care until their favourite app or website stops working. Guess what? Most XP users know that there is Win7, but still don&#8217;t care enough to upgrade.</p>
<p>6 people at my desk, 3 w/ iPhone, 2 w/ Android, 1 BB.. I&#8217;m the only one who knows which v of OS his phone his on&#8230;<br />
&#8220;WE&#8221; care.. and since we&#8217;re online on these kinds of forums all the time we think what we read here of other users represents the world..</p>
<p>When iOS 5 was coming out all the phone on my twitter account with iPhones started telling each other to update. They said a whole bunch of cool things would happen. So I thought a lot of people would. Also I met a girl last week with a nexus s and she got ics forced onto her device. She had no clue what it was and hates it. So I guess both are true. Just matters what people you are surrounded by.</p>
<p>What you are surrounded by doesn&#8217;t change the fact that there&#8217;s a gross disparity between iOS and Android users being on the latest version. Know why this exists? Because most Android devices won&#8217;t be getting 4.0 while every iOS device for the last 2-3 years will be getting iOS 5.</p>
<p>Never mind the fact that half of them will be getting somewhat crippled versions of iOS 5. It&#8217;s also far easier to update &lt;10 devices than it is to update 100+.</p>
<p>Twitter is a TERRIBLY skewed sample of the general public.</p>
<p>Those people on Twitter were also the ones who thought that iOS 5 magically gave their iPhones LTE capability.</p>
<p>i wonder if Apple counts devices that are not compatible for iOS5 LOL!</p>
<p>probably not.</p>
<p>Android user ICS and JB getting all the features of those releases: 100%</p>
<p>iOS5 users getting full featureset of iOS5: debatable</p>
<p>Also, I am comfortable knowing my 2 yr old Android has been through 2.1 to 2.2 to now 2.3 without a path for 4.0+ &#8230; I&#8217;m due for an upgrade anyways. Once I get my next phone, I&#8217;ll still keep my old one as a PMP.</p>
<p>So in all reality, I&#8217;ll have two Android devices alive and well running both 2.3 and 4.0+&#8230; which puts it at 50% old version and 50% newest version. It&#8217;s not 100%, but that&#8217;s only because I won&#8217;t trash my perfectly good device and Google doesn&#8217;t want to give me a gimped software upgrade just so I can say I have the latest <em>number</em>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t true. I have a Nexus S. It has no face unlock in the official ICS update. This argument is beyond retarded anyway, but you&#8217;re talking rubbish.</p>
<p>One can understand that there are technical limitations, but Apple goes far beyond technical limitations and well into marketing.</p>
<p>Face unlock does not work on the Nexus S  reliably. It is purely a hardware issue, not a marketing/business decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Full&#8221; (I use the term lightly, if you don&#8217;t care about Siri, then you don&#8217;t care) iOS 5 is about 20, though, right?</p>
<p>that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll mostly refer to Android 4.1 as &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221;, using &#8220;JB&#8221; when I&#8217;ve already mentioned &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221; or when I&#8217;m tweeting and can&#8217;t shorten some words.</p>
<p>I really like how smooth the Google Now voice is compared to Siri.</p>
<p>It also delivers the results faster than Siri, in nearly every video I&#8217;ve seen of it in action.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping someone can port Google Now to ICS. It&#8217;s my only hope of getting it as of now.</p>
<p>What phone do you have?</p>
<p>A rooted Sprint Galaxy S2 on an unofficial, &#8220;alpha&#8221; build of ICS CM9.</p>
<p>JB should port quickly. The hardware interactions haven&#8217;t changed much, if at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1749045">Your wish has been granted.</a></p>
<p>I finally jumped on the Nexus train after using skinned Android, and honestly I don&#8217;t know why people do that to themselves.  Its such a horrible experience, and why I always reached for my 4S when doing anything despite having a newer Android device.  Even with ICS I can honestly say I reach for my Nexus more now.  And thats with iOS Beta 2.  But using iOS 6 Beta I&#8217;m positive this is only &gt; 50% of what iOS 6 will be.  The redesigned apps look awesome, and I&#8217;m thinking/wishing/hoping those changes come systemwide with iOS 6.  One thing is for sure, they need an overhaul.  The only work I have to describe ICS is polished, which is insane considering how inconsistent even Gingerbread was.  Now that Jelly Bean adds fast to polished, Apple better come strong.</p>
<p>All that said, if you buy a non-Nexus device, you&#8217;re either a masochist or a sucker&#8230;most likely a sucker.</p>

<p>&#8230;so you&#8217;re the former.</p>

<p>Or a user that needs nothing more than basic, cheap phone?</p>
<p>As someone whose first Android device was a cheap one (Samsung Intercept), and who now owns a GNex running JB, ugh.  It was painfully slow and lagged terribly, to the point where I just bought an EVO 4G outright.</p>
<p>This just in, Verge commenters <strong>hate</strong> when you state the obvious.  More on the 6&#8217;oclock news when Carl Monday files his special report.</p>
<p>Just to let you know, Intel&#8217;s &#8220;tock&#8221; is the big change, (new microarchitecture) and the &#8220;tick&#8221; is the subtle change (die shrink).</p>
<p>Yeah, Dieter totally got that one backwards.</p>
<p>Makes sense. tock is a louder noise.</p>
<p>Looks nice but nothing to sway me away from ios.</p>
<p>Honestly maybe you should try it. I have been using stock Android on the Gnex and iOS on the iPhone 4 for a while now and to me Android is way better, this update is just a bonus. The Nexus is my personal phone and the iPhone is my work phone.</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 4. I have been using the iPhone since the 3G. iOS has been great to me. I&#8217;m looking forward to ios 6. Seen a lot of hands on videos and it&#8217;s all the things I&#8217;ve wanted. Nothing really compells me to use android. I thought of trying a gnex but it&#8217;s at the end of it&#8217;s life cycle. Plus iPhone 5 and iOS 6 are coming out soon. I have an iPad and I love the iCloud syncs between apps. The keyboard, Siri works well, I love how they are integrating yelp, I like the animations, the themes, the font, the new app store, the apps, music, videos, tv shows, I don&#8217;t use any google service but search and maps. Soon I won&#8217;t need to use maps. <br />
So there is a lot attracting me to IOS.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re trolling</p>
<p>Irrelevant top level comment maybe, but I don&#8217;t think he is trolling at all. Everything he said is based on personal opinion and may be true to him. Android isn&#8217;t for everyone.</p>
<p>Except this:<br />
&#8220;I thought of trying a gnex but it’s at the end of it’s life cycle.&#8221; That seems pretty far from the truth.</p>
<p>Right. The GNex isn&#8217;t even a year old and will be the first to get Jelly Bean&#8230;. So there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at the end of its life cycle. Google will announce another phone in the fall/winter.</p>
<p>That is not the same.<br />
An example of a device that is at the end of its lifecycle would be the iPhone 3GS.</p>
<p>Yes, everyone who has an opinion different form yours, in this thread, is trolling.</p>
<p>I dunno, I see you around a lot of Android articles.</p>
<p>Someone might be a closet Android fan ;-)</p>
<p>I love your view.  You might actually get through life without experiencing anything new.</p>
<p>They sure do come up with the stupidest names for the operating systems.<br />
Planet-Privacy.tk</p>
<p>they&#8217;re all desserts, and all listed alphabetically based on release.<br />
Apple codenames OS X after big cats. and Microsoft has been codenaming its recent Xbox-related projects after beach cities in northeastern Brazil (Kinect was &#8220;Project Natal&#8221; and what may be &#8220;Kinect 2&#8221; or &#8220;Kinect 2&#8221; is &#8220;Project Fortaleza&#8221;).</p>
<p>Has anybody noticed that the Gnex with Jellybean has way better Signal strength?</p>
<p>If they somehow increased the signal strength on the GSM version then that would be awesome. I always have less bars and a weaker signal compared to the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Thats weird, Josh said that he always gets better speeds with a Nexus. I have a better signal with my Nexus but mine is on T-mobile and my iPhone is on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Have you done a speed test with both? Maybe Google and Apple just have the signal icons set differently.</p>
<p>I have done speed tests, but that is not really relevant because the Galaxy Nexus cannot take full advantage of AT&amp;T&#8217;s HSPA+ network. I had an iPhone 4S and my GNex right next to each other, on the same network, and the GNex got 3.2 Mbps while the iPhone got ~8.0 Mbps.</p>
<p>And when I am at the local bar I will get failed/dropped calls on my GNex while the iPhone can make calls fine and can access the internet (both having 1 bar)</p>
<p>I think something is wrong with your Nexus because it does take 100% full advantage of AT&amp;T&#8217;s HSPA+. The test that Josh did were with the Galaxy Nexus and the iPhone 4s. Even on T-mobile the Nexus phones (Nexus One, Nexus S, and GNex) all get faster speeds. My old 3G Nexus One used to get faster speeds then the Sidekick 4G (3G+) on T-mobile.</p>
<p>Did you only compare the bars or did you take a look at the exact signal strength in dB? Bars lie.</p>
<p>I must say that, design-wise, Google really has stepped up their game. 4.1 looks very clean and streamlined now and thats definitely a great thing. I still prefer my iPhone when it comes to daily use and reliability/performance, but there&#8217;s no denying that iOS is looking quite long in the tooth from a design standpoint. Some of the new apps/interfaces are great but the whole OS itself could benefit from a large scale overhaul.</p>
<blockquote>I wish I could say that Android 4.1 is on par with iOS on an iPhone 4S when it comes to its reaction to my finger&#8217;s taps and swipes — but iOS still takes the crown here. </blockquote>
<p>Can The Verge or someone with a high-speed camera substantiate this? I have the latest iPod Touch and Galaxy S2 and I never felt any differences in reaction time (although it&#8217;s possible because iPhone uses different hardware than iPod).</p>
<p>It uses radically different hardware</p>
<p>The iPhone 4S has a dual core A5 while the iPod touch has a single core A4.</p>
<p>iPod Touch =/= iPhone 4S, but also: Your Galaxy S2 is not running 4.1, so the comparison you made isn&#8217;t really valid either.</p>
<p>Best mobile OS ever. I wonder if the proper release can possibly be even better than what I&#8217;m running at the moment, which is amazing.</p>
<p>Gorgeous, wonderfully modern UI. I&#8217;ve switched to my Nexus as my main device with this release. So long as Apple insists on interfaces that involve stitched leather and faux tape recorders, I think I&#8217;ll be staying on this side.</p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t launch google talk nor tell you the latest appointment?  Seriously?  I&#8217;m disappointed.  (I&#8217;m not saying this in comparison to Siri, just saying they seem like obvious queries)</p>
<p>App launching and changing device settings has not been implemented yet, but they will come</p>
<blockquote>nor tell you the latest appointment?</blockquote>
<p>The Google Now homescreen shows you it&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, but I think it would make sense to be queried against with voice.  I think technology is FINALLY moving toward technology as assistants rather than feature laden stuff that requires a lot of interaction to use.  On a side note, perhaps google can name their digital assistant Jarvis.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to look like an idiot talking to my phone/then getting angry when it doesn&#8217;t recognise my accent. This is the best thing about Google Now &#8211; you can type your queries in. SO much more productive IMO.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s just saying it should be an option on voice. I agree that some people &#8211; like you &#8211; would prefer accessing these things without voice, but a lot of other people would also love it on Voice Search. It&#8217;s not a win or lose situation.</p>
<p>I really like that Google Now feature. It would be nice if Siri could do the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m not quite sure why he suggested Siri was better or could do more. Other than the two commands he said at the beginning which were siri-specific, Android can do more and do it better.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a Windows Phone fan, but Jelly Bean looks pretty awesome. Sadly, the real ugliness of Android is OEM skinning and poor update delivery. It&#8217;s going to be a really long time before the majority of Android users out there even gets a glimpse of Google Now.</p>

<p>Can someone write a plugin to replace the verge videos with the youtube versions?</p>
<p>Or you could subscribe to the Verge Youtube channel.</p>
<p>Great, thorough review.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t know Dieter was a Twins fan. He&#8217;s now my favorite XD</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could say that Android 4.1 is on par with iOS on an iPhone 4S when it comes to its reaction to my finger&#8217;s taps and swipes — but iOS still takes the crown here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that this argument is VERY generalized when it should only be specific to the iPhone 4s rather than iOS as a whole.</p>
<p>Android 4.0 and beyond uses the GPU to accelerated the UI. What this means is that a faster GPU should render the UI faster. The Galaxy Nexus, in particular, has a VERY outdated GPU (PowerVR 540) that is sub-par when compared to the Galaxy S2 (Mali 400 MP4) or the iPhone 4S (PowerVR SGX543 MP2)&#8230; Also, The resolution and screen size of the Galaxy Nexus is higher than the iPhone, which also displays and renders more objects.</p>
<p>Stock ICS felt WAYYYY faster on the Galaxy S2 than it did on the Galaxy Nexus. I&#8217;d wait to see how a stable JellyBean ROM on the Galaxy S2 performs and compare that with the iPhone 4S&#8230; I&#8217;m not even going to mention how it&#8217;ll be on the Galaxy S3, bet we can imagine.</p>
<p>I see what you mean when I witness the same game played on the Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy S2 side by side.</p>
<p>I really am considering the Next Nexus phone as my next device at the end of the year but there are a few features that I am worried about lacking/transitioning from my iOS/OS X life.</p>
<p>Any advice&#8217;d be great.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/28/3123690/some-questions-from-a-potential-ios-convert" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/28/3123690/some-questions-from-a-potential-ios-convert</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really in the iOS/OS X ecosystem, I don&#8217;t see a point. All the apps you&#8217;e purchased, you&#8217;ll have to get used to new counterparts, you&#8217;ll lose iCloud integration, and more than likely have worse battery life/signal.</p>
<p>That, and you&#8217;ll not be on the latest version of Android within 8-10 months because your device &#8220;isn&#8217;t supported,&#8221; and I bet your current iOS phone will be for the next 2 years (unless it&#8217;s a 3GS).</p>
<p>Google has had a cloud ecosystem for a lot longer than Apple, their services are arguably better and can do more too. And they integrated with Apple&#8217;s, so they will upload all your iTunes songs for free, and more.</p>
<p>If you buy a Nexus you&#8217;ll not have upgrade issues. I hardly think that just because you bought some apps on iOS is a good reason to stay, especially with all its limitations and how far ahead Android is.</p>
<blockquote>Google has had a cloud ecosystem for a lot longer than Apple, their services are arguably better and can do more too. And they integrated with Apple’s, so they will upload all your iTunes songs for free, and more.</blockquote>
<p>This is fairly subjective. Docs/Drive is certainly worse than Pages/Numbers/Keynote, and Apple&#8217;s iCloud offers third party developers more features than any of Google&#8217;s current offerings. Yes, many of google&#8217;s web based services are very mature, and very good, but Apple isn&#8217;t looking to compete with all of those, their cloud offering is a very different kind of beast.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d get a Nexus so support wouldn&#8217;t be as much of an issue.</p>
<p>It would a annoying, expensive and tough to leave the iOS/OS X ecosystem 9as it would be vice versa too) but I&#8217;m just so unimpressed by iOS 6. I&#8217;m getting very bored of iOS. I mean, it serves all my purposes wonderfully, I&#8217;m just bored. Which I guess is a pretty flimsy reason.</p>
<p>Jellybean just looks so great.</p>
<p>If there was more than any other time to try out Android, now is the time. Also, using an Android device will really open your eyes about the ecosystem instead of basing it off writer&#8217;s opinions.</p>
<p>- former solely iOS enthusiast, now all-around mobile enthusiast</p>
<p>I doubt you read this post as Nexus devices by definition are Google devices which receive update support before any other device. Google&#8217;s Nexus S which premiered with Gingerbread has received Ice Cream Sandwich and now is officially receiving Jellybean regardless of it&#8217;s 2 year life span.</p>
<p>Also, something must be biased when you generalize that any Android device will &#8220;more than likely have worse battery/life signal.&#8221;</p>
<p>I switched from iOS to Android and never looked back. Just get a Nexus. Google&#8217;s ecosystem integrates really well too for the most part. Google Music is free and syncs your iTunes music with it.</p>
<p>Did you read my post? For my preferences it&#8217;s not as easy as just uploading everything to Google music (and I don&#8217;t want to, I like a &#8216;home hub&#8217; way of living).</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t mean that to come off as rude as it did, I apologise.</p>
<p>Am I incorrect in thinking that it was Apple that borrowed swipe to camera from android?</p>
<p>Nexus 7 will have this, correct?</p>
<p>Correct. I already preordered mine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m utterly impressed with Jelly Bean. I didn&#8217;t expect that Google could find so much room for improvement after releasing Ice Cream Sandwich. Not that ICS was perfect but it was really a giant leap forward for Android.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the build for the Galaxy Nexus available a developer preview? Why isn&#8217;t this mentioned in the review?</p>
<blockquote> In truth, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve seen everything that either of those competing operating systems will bring to the table by the end of the year. </blockquote>
<p>No  reason there couldn&#8217;t be a second Android update near the end of the year.</p>
<p>Very impressed with Android under the UX guidance of Matias. What used to be very geeky &#8220;lots of bits thrown together&#8221; is now seeming like an integrated whole. And Android really has nailed the data and cross-app integration &#8211; probably Apple&#8217;s weakest point.</p>
<p>This is just all good stuff, both for Google and where it pushes the industry.</p>
<p>Agreed. Not trying to over-glorify Matias but ever since he joined Google, Android has really seen marked improvements in its overall aesthetics and UI design.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s like night and day.</p>
<p>Does Google Now require GPS to be enabled?  Or, does it perform better if you have GPS enabled?  I ask because currently GPS saps battery like a son-of-a-mug, and I don&#8217;t ever have it on unless I need it for directions.  I assume that it is getting more accurate data if it is on, thus the reason for asking.</p>
<p>Secondly if it is yes to all the above, we are then expected to have it on.  I wouldn&#8217;t like living in a world where my battery lasts only a few hours.  It just seems we are going that route.</p>
<p>I assume google now would not require gps but it wuld make it more accurate and be able to provide better data for you. also gps only uses battery when it is in use. leaving it on has no effect on the battery.</p>
<p>This is my point, Now and other apps will be pinging the GPS all the time.  The idea that  a phone in the near future will know who you are and where you are and give you relevant data based on that information hinges soley upon the GPS being on all the time and being used.  Battery life is going to get pwned.</p>
<p>No it does not require GPS.  Been running JB over the weekend and gave it a go with GPS on and off.  Obviously it pinpoints your location better with it on, but it&#8217;s not necessary.</p>
<p>Google have a good idea where you are without the GPS chip. I think it&#8217;s from the wifi &#8211; but it&#8217;s spookily accurate.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good video doing the rounds on G+ showing off some stuff the voice search can do &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo</a></p>
<p>Most impressive.  /Vader</p>
<p>Jelly Bean is going to rule when I get it on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus some time next year&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>FOF.</p>
<p>Too dark, add some colors Matias!</p>
<p>Google Now is a game changer.  True to form, Google will iterate it quickly and it will become indispensable for Android users.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s something that their competitors will have a difficult (if not impossible) time answering.</p>
<p>You can take a look at Jelly Beans tablet interface if you configure an Android emulator with tablet specs (primarily the correct screen density and resolution) and it will show you something that looks like a tablet mode for ICS or HC.  The Android team probably added another screen density that allows large screen devices to show up in a similar way to phones.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be sweet if face unlock blink detect could be patterned to unlock the phone as well?  Check it: wink right eye, blink, wink left eye, wink left eye , and boom &#8211; unlocked phone.  This way, even if someone is your doppelganger, you still have a small level of additional security.  I mean, if you are going to use face unlock, why not have the option for a patterned unlock?</p>
<p>Google, make it happen&#8230; considering face unlock/blink detect code is already in place, this should be a relatively easy add.</p>
<p>Lol, seriously?? btw, not all people can wink.</p>
<p>Exactly &#8211; maybe my doppelganger can&#8217;t wink, lol.  A patterned blink/wink unlock doesn&#8217;t need to be forced, but if Google IS forcing users to blink to unlock phones using face detect, why not let me blink/wink in sequence if I want?</p>
<p>Sounds interesting, but I, for one, would not be interested in performing a complicated series of winks in public, while looking at my locked phone.</p>
<p>Throw in some accelerometer gestures and you can unlock your phone and tell someone to steal 2nd at the same time.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen to the quality of the first comments on a given article if comments were locked out for the first ~5-10 minutes after a new article was posted&#8230; actually encouraging folks to read the article.</p>
<p>This is a great idea. Seriously.</p>
<p>How about some consistency in our video formats Verge. I expect to be able to watch the video reviews on your mobile Site because I&#8217;ve been able to in the past.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re streamer is also not great, just save a lot of people headaches and post everything to YouTube please. I would love to watch your JB review in Chrome on JB but I guess y&#8217;all didn&#8217;t get the flash memo. Sad for a tech Site.</p>
<p>I liked iOS more the Android but now Android is much better than iOS nothing really new did come with iOS 6</p>
<p>I went from iOS to Android and never looked back. Just get a Nexus.</p>
<p>I got a Windows Phone its even better than the new Android :D</p>
<p>You funny.</p>
<p>Do you Stalk me ?</p>
<p>sorry did mixed up you with some one other</p>
<p>get a Nexus if you&#8217;re in the US or you hack it to get direct updates from Google.<br />
unless Samsung releases Jelly Bean for the non-US Galaxy Nexus a week or two after Google releases it.</p>
<p>looks good can&#8217;t wait for this OTA update<br />
5.0 dat Key Lime :P</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo&feature=youtube_gdata_player" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>
<p>I fail to see how you or anyone can think Siri is better.</p>
<p>Just wait for iOS 6 and you&#8217;ll see why, it&#8217;s right around the corner.</p>
<p>I already saw the video of iOS 6 Siri vs. Android 4.1. Not much of a difference from how it is now. Android still looked way better and could do more, was more accurate, and far faster.</p>
<p>That, and it actually resembled a human speaking.</p>
<p>So since very few people will see Android 4.1 until at least next year, we should be comparing Jelly Bean to iOS 7, lol.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to buy a phone with 4.1 on when it is released, so no, it should be compared to iOS5.</p>
<p>Because iOS6 won&#8217;t be out when Jelly Bean releases.</p>
<p>Nope. Actually Nexus devices will have it in two weeks dude.</p>
<p>Exactly &#8211; only new devices, but long/unclear roadmaps for everyone else. I will be curious to see in 6 months how many people actually have Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>No, not new devices. Only Nexuses. There are Nexus Ones, Nexus Ses, and Galaxy Nexus, the latter are over half a year old. The Nexus S was a year before that, and it got ICS.</p>
<p>Sigh &#8211; replace new with Nexus in my previous post. That&#8217;s what I get for commenting during work.</p>
<p>Haha, okay, fair enough. But still, if you care about updates, get the Nexus phone. Simple. With iOS you don&#8217;t even have a choice about other kinds of phones. With Android you can do the same thing: buy one phone model and get guaranteed updates. I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with that.</p>
<p>Exactly!  Somehow having the <em>choice</em> to choose other devices with varying screen sizes, skins, physical keyboards, gimmicks&#8230; at the expense of regular updates is a negative thing?<br />
Trade-offs: Life&#8217;s full of em.</p>
<p>the Nexus One didn&#8217;t get ICS and won&#8217;t get Jelly Bean from Google.</p>
<p>Much better performance but still stutters/lags around a bit&#8230;</p>
<p>Camera app looks just like the WP7 one which I&#8217;ve had for a year now&#8230;nice copy job&#8230;</p>
<p>Holy shit! It&#8217;s almost like smartphone operating systems are borrowing ideas from each other! I would have never guessed!</p>
<p>Yeah still lags. I&#8217;ll stick with Windows Phone.</p>
<p><strong>Thats useless search bar&#8230;<br />
</strong><br />
i cant remember if ICS on GNex let me remove it, but playing with the GNex on JB i am really annoyed by this big google search bar. If this had functionality e.g. you can type in it while the homescreen stays there, i would still complain about the fact you can not remove it. This bar does nothing you cant do by swiping the screen up or prssing a 1&#215;1 Google Search launcher, plus its really intrusivie compared to its ICS Version. Basically, JB on GNex wastes two lines of screen real estate for those Softkeys and for this damn search bar</p>
<p>Verge folks, i kow you love stock, i know why and I accept that this&#8230;BUT how can you let something designed so stubborn and un-elegant slip below your radar?</p>
<p>Cyanogenmod 9 is your best friend. Or just use apex launcher. you can remove the draded thing if you want.</p>
<p>maybe, but this is a review of Stock JB. You can remove this bar on Sense and TouchWiz as well</p>
<p>Another Thing: JB is still super stubborn when it comes to syncing the adressbokk with e.g. facebook. And dont get me that &#8220;its facebooks fault&#8221; shit. I can do it on the HTC One, i can do it on the Galaxy S3 &#8211; why t.f. die Google break this?</p>
<p>Seems like a good thing to me. Have you read about the problems with iOS6 having Facebook integration and how Facebook is changing contact info automatically? I would hate for my phone to automatically delete all my contact info and replace it with something else, because Facebook wanted to.</p>
<p>i just want to have a choice, and my choice is to sync facebook like i did, and con do on other Androids. Stock Android is not the answer two all prayers, its good, but its missing so much as well</p>
<p>Why cant i configer when to sync my mails in its exchange client? I dont want work mails to arrive in the middle of the night!</p>
<blockquote>And dont get me that "its facebooks fault"</blockquote>
<p>As Google has published the new API and there is plenty of documentation yes, it is Facebook fault</p>
<p>seriously, why do i as a customer have to worry about childish fights on who did not read whos memo on which API? I just want stuff to work as it does on other phones, not a nerd war. Google, if you want to score outside of the IT Squad, have those discussions BEFORE you dump products on the market</p>
<p>If haqxsync can do it why can&#8217;t facebook <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mots.haxsync&hl=en" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mots.haxsync&amp;hl=en</a></p>
<p>Disable the google search app through app settings, it will disappear.</p>
<p>but Now with swipe up is still there?</p>
<p>hmmm, tired that. now i have just a grey bar. I want my homescreen space back!</p>
<p>63° in San Fran&#8230;..FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU</p>
<p>Over 100° in St. Louis. #f7u12</p>
<p>Ill take my 65° and slight breeze, in Seattle, hey its not raining&#8230;</p>
<p>1. It was just a joke</p>
<p>2. That is the point of the joke &#8211; only new devices, but no clear road  map for everyone else.</p>
<p>Great stuff! Wanting to buy an Android phone as I feel iOS has stagnated with iOS6.</p>
<p>Not sure about buying a Galaxy Nexus this late though, may just wait for a new one. My iPhone 4S should keep me going for a while longer.</p>
<p>Have you looked at the Nexus 7? I just preordered mine. Awesome tablet from everything I&#8217;ve seen. But yeah, the next Nexus is close enough to wait.</p>
<p>I have, however. I&#8217;m still not fully sold on Android from an application perspective.</p>
<p>From an OS, I feel the core OS is more important on a phone, but on a tablet the application and general content ecosystem is more important and I&#8217;m don&#8217;t think it is up to standard yet.</p>
<p>Perhaps i&#8217;ll more, but from a tablet perspective I think i&#8217;m still happy with iOS (iPad 3rd gen).</p>
<p>Well the Nexus 7 I think is small enough to run non-tablet apps very easily and have it be suitable. However, Android apps work differently than iOS ones, in ways that don&#8217;t really need specific tablet apps. Look up &#8220;fragments&#8221; and read about that. It basically lets one app look very different on different sized screens, sort of like how websites do.</p>
<p>Offline maps is awesome! cant wait to try it out. At least I don&#8217;t need Jelly Bean for it. I wonder when Cyanogenmod 9 will jump on it. My sensation is waiting&#8230;</p>
<p>Looks good, but I&#8217;m not liking the new, less Tron-like, less blue UI. That was my favorite UI ever from a pure looks perspective.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, it&#8217;s notification city up in here.&#8221;<br />
&#8212; Dieter Bohn</p>
<p>Reading these test notifications in the video was fun.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more impressive than the new OS is this review, amazing job. Thanks for respecting your readers intelligence.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a real discussion that does not degrade into iOS vs Android. I have yet to see it happen.</p>
<p>Welcome to nerd sports. Pick a side and root for your team.</p>
<p><em>Find my phone, remote lock, and remote wipe</em></p>
<p>These features have been available for quite a while on Android. You need to download the app called &#8220;Google Device Policy&#8221; from the Play Store. This app can also be used by organizations to enforce a minimum level of security on their users&#8217; devices (for instance, impose a PIN instead of the normal swipe-to-unlock screen.)</p>
<p>The video quality is really bad. Get me some HQ or HD, please. I noticed the same thing on the last Mobile Show.  Nice review, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Use the 4S as my daily, but can&#8217;t wait to try this out on my Nexus S backup.  Hopefully, it fixes the lagginess  on that phone.</p>
<p>Did you install a task killer on it? If you did, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s laggy. Never install a task killer on Android. They are useless and should be banned. They CAUSE lag, poor battery life, and force closes.</p>
<p>No I didn&#8217;t.  Touch response isn&#8217;t as fast, web browsing isn&#8217;t bad, but my main issue is with apps like Facebook and Twitter.  They always seems laggier on the Nexus S, but I&#8217;m not sure if that is a refresh issue that Android is known for?</p>
<p>Nice review, and JB looks great, can&#8217;t wait for the Nexus 7.<br />
From every videos comparing Google Voice search vs Siri I&#8217;ve seen so far, Google&#8217;s solution seems to deliver much faster and accurate results. I also love the its voice sound as opposed to the &#8216;robotic&#8217; tone of Siri.</p>
<p>This one is amazing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo&feature=youtube_gdata_player" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHkhp6BwnGo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this a developer preview? There might still be minor bugs that needed to be fixed before the source is officially released.</p>
<p>JB looks great, and so did ICS. Of course unless you have a Nexus device or are willing to install Cyanogenmod, your phone won&#8217;t get it for 6-18 months&#8212; if you&#8217;re lucky. If not, your phone will never get it.</p>
<p>Google kinda-sorta addressed this with their &#8220;platform development kit&#8221; at I/O, but the proof is in the pudding&#8212; will recently released devices like the SGS3 , HTC ONEX, RAZR MAXXX, etc, get JB in the next 3 months?</p>
<p>(I doubt it very much.)</p>
<p>I doubt it too, but if you care about updates at all then you should get a Nexus if you don&#8217;t want to root. Either way, I think Google should work on creating some kind of framework for OEMs to add more features and skins to Android but not touch the underlying OS so Google can update that directly but it will look and work the same, but have more features.</p>
<p>Since they only got it 2 weeks before the announcement of JB I wouldn&#8217;t expect it coming much faster than previous versions. The effect of the PDK will first shine with the next android version</p>
<p>Google should probably release a 4.1.1 update to fix the folders running way from app problem and quick access to shortcuts even from locked screens.<br />
If it&#8217;s a widget, just move everything around. If it&#8217;s a 1&#215;1 app or shortcut, putting it over a folder should widen the circle to indicate letting go would put it in the folder, but if the user holds it there for 1 second, then it should move.</p>
<p>Probably by the end of year not more than 5% devices will have it :)</p>
<p>all i care is about my device.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it kind of irresponsible for the review not to mention that it&#8217;s a pre-release version of the operating system?  It&#8217;s true that nothing major will change between now and release, but it should still be mentioned.  Also, it&#8217;s possible that &#8220;problems&#8221; called out in the review could be fixed (e.g. folders moving out of the way).</p>
<p>So what happens when you turn the Nexus 7 to landscape mode when you&#8217;re on the home screen?  Does Jellybean just maintain its portrait orientation?  I too am curious as to whether that&#8217;s the new default.  Wasn&#8217;t landscape generally the default for previous Android tablets?</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m not mistaken, the N7 stays on portrait orientation when you&#8217;re on the home screen.</p>
<p>As an iOS user since the beginning I find the current state of Android rather shocking. It&#8217;s not just as good as iOS, it&#8217;s far superior on every level. The UI is clean and modern, (and free from hideous skeumorphic crap), the widgets look useful, Google Now looks much better than SIRI, and obviously Google Maps are generations ahead what the iPhone has now or will have when Apple downgrades us all to it&#8217;s own amateur hour maps.</p>
<p>I just wish there was a killer stock Android device to buy. The Galaxy Nexus was never that great even when it was new (poor screen and ancient GPU), and there&#8217;s no sign of the next Nexus phone.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 is pretty killer.  But I get it that you&#8217;re talking about phones.  Those I&#8217;d expect by the holidays.</p>
<p>Come to the dark side, we have cupcakes, and doughnuts, and eclairs, and frozen yogurt, and gingerbread, and honeycombs, and ice cream sandwiches, and jelly beans.</p>
<p>and Key lime is on the whats coming soon list&#8230; :D</p>
<p>They totally should have named it after meat.</p>
<p>Android Lamb Shank. Who wouldn&#8217;t want that?</p>
<p>give me some rosemary and thyme, grill over charcole/mesquete  <strong>Delish</strong></p>
<p>There should be at least 5 Nexus devices this fall, from 5 top manufacturers. So you should wait a bit more until November or so. They will also come with Android 5.0 (the one after JellyBean).</p>
<p>Great review. You remained objective while praising which is always good. I particularly liked the idea you put forward at the end:</p>
<blockquote>Location, identity, history, and personal preferences are all combined into an organic information system that&#8217;s as promising as it is ambitious.</blockquote>
<p>The idea of an Android becoming more <em>organic</em> is a theme which seems to be trailing us this year.</p>
<p>The Google Now voiced the baseball game incorrectly.  The result showed that the Twins won the game while the voice program noted that the Twins had lost.</p>
<p>I thought this version of JB was a &#8220;pre-release&#8221; for devs. I can understand reviewing new features but some things can still change or be improved by the time an official OTA Final Build Release of version of 4.1 is out. So why not wait to review that version?</p>
<p>Is there any indication that the features of Google Now are possible without the information being kept to sell you ads?<br />
The passive &#8220;always knowing&#8221; aspect of the service seems great, but not if the information is constantly feeding to Google for other reasons (for me). It is certainly an ambitious undertaking, but I just feel like I would trust someone besides Google to be able to do it without leveraging that data as a commodity. Obviously, I&#8217;m kind of in the minority with that type of mentality, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>i used to hate android with a passion but 4.0 blew me away &#8211; 4.1 looks amazingggg</p>
<p>question is now&#8230; when will we see the next nexus device?</p>
<p>I would guess we won&#8217;t see the Next Nexus device until Fall of this year.  at least based on past.</p>
<p>hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p>so around the same time as the iphone 5!</p>
<p>decisions, decisions&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple maybe have kept <strong>some</strong> features hidden for the launch of iPhone 5. Maybe they are major ones, maybe they are not. After all this was their main event for iOS. The fall one will be mostly about the new iPhone.</p>
<p>Same with WP8. It&#8217;s not much new in it compared to WP7, as far as direct user benefits go. I doubt they will add anything too major to it by fall, because they need to already start working with manufacturers to launch it in fall.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Android 4.1 was a &#8220;minor&#8221; upgrade for Android (even though it seems bigger than both iOS 6 and WP8). But the really BIG one will be Android 5.0, which is also launching this fall. So yeah, I don&#8217;t see how both Apple and Microsoft can top Google this year.</p>
<p>you think that Android 5.0 is coming this fall? Did I miss something at I/o?</p>
<p>most definitely NO. At max another incremental update.</p>
<p>Dieter, it&#8217;s a shame to have such dirty fingernails on video, it&#8217;s even worse than the bike gloves in the gaming PC building video!!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s sadly true!</p>
<p>I just got my unlocked Galaxy Nexus and put JB on it. This thing rocks. Google Now especially, it rips apart Siri. I got a feeling the next Nexus phone is going to own.</p>
<p>Someone needs a manicure.</p>
<p>so when is this coming to my Verizon Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>Android owns ios.</p>
<p>They finally got rid of Roboto?!  DOMO ARIGATO!</p>
<p>&#8230;ok, I&#8217;ll go now.</p>
<p>that font IS Roboto.</p>
<p>That was a great Christopher Walken impersonation during the offline dictation part of the video. Also, great in-depth review, now I know exactly what I&#8217;ll be getting with Jelly Bean. Now i just have too wait a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to try Jelly Bean myself. I&#8217;m sticking with Nexus devices until such time that Android&#8217;s PDK would help OEMs fast track in updating at least their flagship devices.</p>
<p>Why do I feel like this is what ICS should have been initially?</p>
<p>Google Now seems&#8230;dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honey, take a look at this cat video, cool right?&#8221;</p>
<p>- Google Now has detected it is =Wank Time=<br />
Displaying Anime tentacle porn.<br />
&#8220;NOOOO&#8221;<br />
- Google Now has detected &#8220;denial&#8221;. User does want his tentacle porn, but is ashamed. Displaying tentacle porn, stop button omited</p>
<p>so since matgis duarte slagged metro, android is starting to look more and more like metro in every new iteration&#8230; except it is still messier.</p>
<p>I thought the selling feature of the camera was no shutter lag? Has it gotten slower in 4.1?</p>
<p>No, they just added a different animation to it. If you try snapping pics really fast in 4.1, it just skips the transition animation.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait till the CM team gets their hands on the source for this. All the current ports seem to be plagued with nagging problems. Definitely not going to rely on Verizon for an OTA update any time soon.</p>
<p>Nice review!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to completely ignore the whole Android vs iOS vs Blackberry fight (Windows Phone get back to me when you actually have a known presence in the market&#8230; sorry). This looks like Google is finally letting Android mature instead of throwing the baby out with the bath water each time. It seems to me a big issue with the fragmentation (that is very real on Android) is the constant refresh of everything from the ground up. Based on what I see here in Jelly Bean, device manufacturers who have working ICS builds for existing &amp; future devices in their pipeline should be able to transition to JB in short order. At least that&#8217;s my 2 cents.</p>
<p>Yes, I think Google did a pretty big overhaul of the architecture with ICS. Now they are just going to build on it. Although, every 2 major dot-oh versions they might still shake up things quite a lot (Android 6.0). I don&#8217;t think Google wants Android to become <strong>too</strong> stagnant.</p>
<p>That being said, I do wish they release only one major version of Android per year, instead of 2. This way manufacturers get to actually have some time to port the new version to all (most?) of their phones by the time another version is out. In the current state, you barely get to see a handful of phones with the new version, before another one comes out&#8230;and so on.</p>
<p>They will still have the same time and still require the same time to update regardless of the number of updates to Android.</p>
<p>Technology waits for no one.</p>
<p>to buy or wait for iphone 5? this is the vexing question&#8230;</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t new Nexus phones due out around the same time?  More vexing questions to ponder&#8230;</p>
<p>this is going to make it harder for me to sleep now.</p>
<p>where have you heard this vexing rumor?</p>
<p><a href="http://crave.cnet.co.uk/mobiles/google-plans-five-nexus-phones-and-tablets-for-jelly-bean-50007964/">Google plans five Nexus phones and tablets for Jelly Bean</a></p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus II (Samsung), Xperia Nexus (Sony), One Nexus (HTC), Optimus Nexus (LG), RAZR Nexus (Motorola &#8211; part of Google)?<br />
and will most of them have a global launch? and will the non-Google Play Store-boought devices be updated by Google?</p>
<p>Xperia Nexus sounds sweeeet!</p>
<p>your questions are appropriate but vexing. i dream of the future where android devices are updated silently like google chrome desktop browser.</p>
<p>but first someone needs to disrupt the carriers.</p>
<p>wait for iphone 6, that will be better than iphone 5.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? I&#8217;m holding out for iPhone 9 and iOSX Furry Kitty!</p>
<p>is it true that iphone 6 will be a nanobot?</p>
<p>Every time I see this Google Now is creepy talk, I stop taking people seriously. From what I understand, you have to opt-in to the service. If I&#8217;m wrong about that, then you are definitely able to opt-out of it. How can something be creepy if you know what it does, yet you still allow or enable it to function. Nothing about Google&#8217;s services are creepy unless you allow them to be. That onus is all on you. And let&#8217;s not act like Google&#8217;s the only one tracking you either. They all do, and they all give you the option of either opting in or out.</p>
<p>personally I don&#8217;t like android UI, but if you do then I guess it good to see the OS getting stronger. After my time with froyo/gingerbread i&#8217;ll probably never go back.</p>
<p>Froyo and Gingerbread are NOTHING like the Holo UI in 4.0+.</p>
<p>You left just in time for their major UI overhaul!</p>
<p>I never realized how laggy ICS was they&#8217;ve made a MASSIVE improvement.</p>
<p>Check this: <a href="http://goo.gl/NMb9z" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/NMb9z</a></p>
<p>Basically, &#8220;laggy&#8221; Android is because of bad design decision in the very beginning of system development&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><em>&#8230; Android in the longer run have to rewrite the GUI toolkit to avoid the issues such as animation running in the main UI thread as well as giving the UI a real-time priority as on the iOS&#8230;</em></blockquote>
<p>You probably missed that Andrew Munn, the source for that rant, retracted all of his comments and apologised for his &#8220;inaccuracies&#8221;.</p>
<p>google Now is the most significant thing in this update, really interested to see how this evolves. Siri was designed to lessen the &#8220;friction&#8221; of certain tasks on a phone but just replaced tapping with frustrating lags and misinterpretation. I like the idea that phone is actually learning from me. Makes android really appealing to me, and I&#8217;m heavily invested in Apple&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>Does it feel good to see the world in a new light?  I know it was for me when i left WinMo&#8230;</p>
<p>A few things&#8230;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t remote wipe available if the phone is tied to Google Apps for Business? I know it&#8217;s nothing like a built-in feature for individuals, but it&#8217;s at least something.</p>
<p>I thought landscape mode was available on the home screen via accessibility settings?</p>
<p>I also figured the swipe-to-camera that was available since ICS was more &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from all the third-party lock screens and ROMs that were available prior (Same goes with the widget resizing and auto-arranging icons). iOS unlock-to-camera was featured in 5.1 first, correct? A number of months after ICS?</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of borrowed features, I believe Microsoft owns the whole swipe right to gallery from the camera app thing. Well, at least they have a patent for it. I remember reading all the &#8220;iOS totally ripppped off Microsoft!&#8221; headlines when iOS 5 introduced this feature. I know Microsoft and Apple have cross-licensing agreements, but how is Android going to battle this one?</p>
<p>No, being able to access the camera from the lock screen debuted in iOS 5 before ICS.  iOS 5.1  brought the swipe gesture to it, but you could still use it before that by double clicking the home button.</p>
<p>Nice android review Dieter :)</p>
<p>I wrote up an editorial about the Google Nexus 7 on my blog and back referenced your android review.</p>
<p>Come check it out : <a href="http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html" target="_blank">http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html</a></p>
<p>I just have to say it again: Dieter looks damn good with his beard.</p>
<p>That twitter logo its outdated.</p>
<p>Twitter is yet to update its Android app with the new logo.</p>
<p>i have it.</p>
<p>Dieter: check this out for some great Google Now questions:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2012/07/03/video-40-questions-to-test-out-googles-new-voice-search/" target="_blank">http://www.droid-life.com/2012/07/03/video-40-questions-to-test-out-googles-new-voice-search/</a></p>
<p>No matter how many times I try to switch Android, knowing that its the superior OS, I always end up back on iOS. I can&#8217;t put my finger on it, but something about Android ruins the whole experience for me.</p>
<p>Something about something that you haven&#8217;t tried ruins the experience for it &#8230; Hmm.</p>
<p>Take the plunge. There&#8217;s more to see than the iOS ecosystem.</p>
<p>regarding fragmentation<br />
The only thing not fragmented in iOS is the version number. Yes, most iOS devices are on the same version number, but the features are not. People seem to forget that Siri is not available in iphone 4 or ipad 2&#8230;.nor does turn by turn navigation.</p>
<p>The API versions won&#8217;t be either &#8211; so it will be more straightforward for developers. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8211; I think that most of the fragmentation complaints are a lot of blah blah, but you&#8217;re being a little disingenuous here.</p>
<p>False Equivalency. God, you guys need to get some new material.<br />
Ask a developer if Android is fragmented.</p>
<p>Of course, the vast majority of features and APIs are the same.  Pointing out a couple that are not does not really make it the same as a bunch of Android 2.3 devices that can not ever use apps targeted at 4.0.</p>
<p>Project Butter is great, but I wish the &#8220;war on lagginess&#8221; was declared in earlier versions of android.  Nonetheless, good to hear they realize the importance of O/A navigational smoothness moving forward.</p>

<p>Great Steve Jobs Quote.</p>
<p>Thanks for copying&#8212;er.. coming, Mattias</p>
<p>interesting to see that notification menu now comes down over the top status bar which displays time/battery etc! slight change but I do like it!</p>
<p>How many new features are officially coming in Jelly Bean&#8230; Compared to over 200 on iOS 6? Honest question.</p>
<p>See 0.1 update.</p>
<p>is not fast, is still lagging</p>
<p>because you&#8217;ve used it. .</p>
<p>Thanks for the unbiased insight &#8220;iPhonetheKing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Does anyone know, would it be possible with these new notifications to answer messages in the notification area? So if you get a gtalk notification, you pull it down, answer, and you don&#8217;t have to leave the  current app you&#8217;re in, or open the gtalk app. I think that would be sweet!</p>
<p>Good review. Thanks</p>
<p>I am actually quite impressed.  Not impressed enough to make me switch from iPhone but if I did not have a phone it is definitely a serious contender.  I would have to wait until Windows phone 8 comes out to decide where my next purchase will lie.  Mind you I suppose Apple could pull a rabbit out of a hat and convince me to go with them but as I will need to keep my old iPhone anyway to continue using all my old equipment if they change the dock connector they will have to produce something truly awesome to convince me to stay with them.  I am not sure they actually can do that now that His Steveness is no longer at the helm.</p>
<p>I just bought a Galaxy Nexus to try after using iPhones past four-plus years. I think there will be a lot to like, but I&#8217;m not sure it will be enough to continue using Android after the release of the next iPhone. Some items I&#8217;m missing already while using the Galaxy Nexus:</p>
<p>- Quick access to the camera app from a secured lock-screen.<br />
- Number of apps and polish compared to the Apple App Store.<br />
- Android OS is not as cohesive as iOS.<br />
- The build quality is not as beautiful.<br />
- The top right of the screen, and the back of the phone heat up quickly. I never had that problem with an iPhone.<br />
- The wired earbuds don&#8217;t give access to voice control, and they don&#8217;t have volume adjustment.<br />
- The voice control only reliably gets contact names right while using a bluetooth headset. When I press the microphone button on the Google search bar, it&#8217;s not understanding most of my contact names.</p>
<p>What I like in Android and Galaxy Nexus so far:<br />
- The dedicated multitasking button and app switching pane.<br />
- The Google suite of apps, like Gmail and Maps.<br />
- The extra screen real-estate.<br />
- Voice dialing problems aside, I like the Google search bar on the home screen.<br />
- Not being kicked out of the Play app store when I start downloading an app.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how the Jelly Bean update affects my evaluation, and how using the Galaxy Nexus as my daily driver over the next few months works out.</p>
<p>Cheers to competition! It&#8217;s great to see the quick iteration of smart phones.</p>
<p>Luckily iOS 6 finally fixes that stupid &#8220;kicked out of the app store when you start downloading&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>All great points.</p>
<p>An additional thing I wish Android would have is the double click on earbuds to skip to next track.</p>
<p>My experience over the last 6 months with my Galaxy Nexus is quite different to yours (as a previous iPhone user switching to the Gnex) but some of those points are coherent and make sense.</p>
<p>However, i have to argue that my iphone also heated up in similar areas when i played apps on it for a while. Also, not having volume control on the earphones is a passable con, since you can easily control the volume with the buttons on the side of the phone (which i don&#8217;t find a hassle at all).</p>
<p>Dieter does it again.  Great review.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t Dieter clean-shaven a few days ago on the Vergecast? His facial hair must grow ridiculously fast.</p>
<p>Just a FYI, Diane Hackborn said that they aren&#8217;t ditching the HC/ICS tablet view.  They just felt that it was too cramped on the Nexus 7 so they stuck with the phone layout.</p>
<p>Good review. Hopefully this will light a fire in Cupertino.</p>
<p>Yes. This is finally an Android OS that looks exciting.  I may get a Nexus 7 just to play with it.  Apple really didn&#8217;t show much with iOS 6.  The new iPhone better have some new tricks.</p>
<p>Looks to me like both iOS 6 and Jellybean will add a similar amount of new functionality based on watching both presentations.  I&#8217;m getting a Nexus 7 myself to play with though.</p>
<p>glad I bought a nexus</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Android Key Lime Pie will have an audible notification features. You heard it here first.</p>
<p>Will their be a re-review after Google &#8216;patches&#8217; Apple&#8217;s patent?</p>
<p>So out of curiosity why is the video review never a Youtube embed? With Chrome for Android I can no longer watch videos in reviews, but Youtube videos either run HTML5 or at least bounce me out to the dedicated app</p>
<p>Sorry, but this will put Jelly Bean to sleep.<br />

<p>Goodnight.</p>
<p> Excellent review as always, Dieter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, the Android ecosystem still faces a fundamental fragmentation question. The majority of Android devices in consumers&#8217; hands today are now two versions behind&#8221;</p>
<p>Most people are on 2.3. Gingerbread<br />
 <br />
Honeycomb<br />
Ice Cream Sandwich<br />
Jellybean</p>
<p>I realize Honeycomb was a tablet OS, but that&#8217;s just a lame excuse (and people were pissed when Google first told us we couldnt&#8217; have Honeycomb on our phones). Most users (about 90%) are on an OS 3 versions behind.</p>
<p>You realize that OS version numbers are arbitrary.</p>
<p>I mean they could all have been 0.1 releases and it wouldn&#8217;t mean a thing.</p>
<p>Jellybean is a 0.1 release. Also, Honeycomb as a version behind is NOT a lame excuse. How can you be behind on something you can&#8217;t even get your hands on [smartphone].</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I listed the Names of the OSes.</p>
<p>Gingerbread<br />
Honeycomb<br />
Ice Cream<br />
Jellybean</p>
<p>The names are even more arbitrary.</p>
<p>Not really. The names denote &#8216;significant&#8217; upgrades to the core OS and UI, while the version numbers are pretty much arbitrary.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t understand how you can boast about a new OS when the majority of Android smartphone users can&#8217;t get it when they want it like in iOS. I just bought a SSGS3 from an iPhone 4s and I really wish I could get jelly bean when it&#8217;s released. To me that&#8217;s where the focus should be. Granted I&#8217;m brand new to the android world, but it seems like a basic fundamental aspect of creating a new OS. So that anyone and everyone can get it when it&#8217;s released. I&#8217;ve always been able to get the newest iOS when it was released.</p>
<p>If you want the latest OS get a Nexus device plain and simple.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t google find a way to update new OS releases in the form of an iTunes application as Apple does? Is it that complicated?</p>
<p>its the carriers and the OEMs stupid.</p>
<p>do you know of a browser called chrome that updates silently while you are sleeping in your bed. its not that complicated. at least for google.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s OTA, and that&#8217;s as simple as it gets (even Apple does it now because they realized people are too lazy/ fussy to go on a program on your computer, plug in the device, update the phone, then having to disconnect the device from iTunes again).</p>
<p>If you want to blame someone for slow updates to non-nexus android devices, it&#8217;s the OEM&#8217;s and the carriers.</p>
<p>How many iPhone variations are there?<br />
Iphone (not supported)<br />
Iphone  3g (not supported)<br />
Iphone 3GS<br />
Iphone 4<br />
Iphone 4S</p>
<p>So there are 3 iphones.</p>
<p>How many Android phones are there:<br />
Hundreds? Thousands?</p>
<p>And Unlike Apple, Google isn&#8217;t selling these phones except for the Nexus.</p>
<p>Wow. The home screen /keys look amazing. After seeing this it only makes me think ICS was just a beta version of Jelly bean. My goodness it looks amazing. I wonder which OS, ICS/Jellybean is on LG&#8217;s Google TV.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean looks sweet.  Can&#8217;t wait until this is ported to the Evo LTE.</p>
<p>They sure do come up with some silly names!<br />

<p>If you need a &#8220;force stop&#8221; button the OS is a fail. I wish Google would ditch Android and adopt MeeGo.</p>
<p>Why does having a &#8220;Force Stop&#8221; button under Applications &gt; Manage Applications mean the OS has &#8220;failed&#8221; ??  What a stupid thing to say<br />
That&#8217;s like Jobbs saying having a file manager means the OS has failed &#8211; an equally stupid statement</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the greatest OS that Android has produced to date, yet it won&#8217;t make it on to more than 10% of the handsets out there. Sad.</p>
<p>It will make it to 100% of the Nexus devices though?</p>
<p>Right, but&#8230; if you&#8217;re saying that Google should make a hardware device, and that experience is great, then what is Google doing really? They&#8217;re doing exactly what Apple does. And Google doesn&#8217;t want to do that&#8212; they would lose badly if that were their strategy.. they&#8217;re an advertising company, they want to sell ads on Android.</p>
<p>Still no real-time audio without a million hacks on Android?  Must be all that Java running on a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Here are some of the improvements:-</p>
<p>The UI looks more fluid and rich.<br />
Better support for bi-directional languages.<br />
The new notifications look awesome.</p>
<p>The Direct Wifi service discovery feature allows peer to peer connections. This will give a boost to various mobile connected devices. You may connect your Wifi camera directly with your phone and upload pictures. Data available from a multitude of phone inputs like GPS, compass, NFC etc can be shared easily across devices.</p>
<p>Another important feature for the developers is App encryption. Many paid apps are distributed freely and developers loose a lot of money. App encryption will ensure that at least 10 year olds don&#8217;t hack their devices and give away apps for free.</p>
<p>Android Jelly Bean brings support for Television screen. Android is being used on set top boxes as an OS for TV. But the OS wasn&#8217;t supporting non touch input devices until now. The new support for television screen will help developers in optimising their apps for television screen.</p>

<p>Not related to the article, but is there a simpler way to find out who someone&#8217;s replying to rather than trying to visualize an imaginary line in your head to follow? Cuz some of these comment strings are just&#8230; PHEW.</p>
<p>Great review &#8211; Thanks! Can&#8217;t wait to use it.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of iOS Features that they added. ;)</p>

<p>Is it mid-July yet? My Nexus is waiting for you, Jelly Bean!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just hoping that JB for the Galaxy Nexus becomes available at the same time for all devices. I mean, as much as I would prefer an unlocked and international version of any device, Verizon LTE is the teet that keeps me with them.</p>
<p>Now, if they ever force me off of my unlimited plan, I&#8217;ll have to choose between AT&amp;T or T-Mobile and purchase a Galaxy Nexus directly from the Play Store.</p>
<p>How do you compare the speed of 4.1 vs 4.0 vs 2.3?<br />
Do you have a rooted device where you can load all three for common hardware specs? Otherwise the processing power of the latest flagship Nexus device might account for the extra speed &#8211; or lack of battery hit with the new multi-tasking CPU strategy.</p>
<p>Sweet jeebus. Dieter is soooooooo frickin hot.</p>
<p>I have been reading the comments here  for some time now&#8230;..alright. But who wants to use android&#8230;.. very fragmented (I mean it). now first things first; smoothness&#8230;.. let me ask honestly I have ordered a Google nexus 7(if proof needed, shall provide.)to check if its suitable to use internally for a few hundred employees because of its price. I have ordered it after knowing it will not be smooth, but for employees its enough as they will need more than one device in few months due to the nature of my industry. will it last long as my ipad 3?. Moreover is it a copy of many concepts, like smoothness from Windows phone, and other inspiration from earlier apple products? if tis true will someone shamelessly claim as innovation like google has claimed? please de-clog my belief&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants to use Android..&#8221; ? Fact: More people are using Android than IOS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty much in the same situation as you, as I wanted to buy a Nexus 7 to check how its corporate competitiveness (unfortunatly I can&#8217;t).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a iOS and Android user (Android Phone, iOS tablet), and Android has come a long way. A very long way, from an unusable mess, to a very usable OS with lots of features. And yes, they have been inspired a lot by WP (i.e ViewPager) and iOS in general (only fandroids will deny this). I was actually quite impressed by the way WP distanced itself from iOS and provided a very different experience, while Android uses pratically the same UI conventions as iOS (and the ones they didn&#8217;t use, like the menu, are being depracated because of ActionBar which is iOS like). This is fact, not a moral judgement.</p>
<p>Sidenote:: Yes, iOS copied notification center. We all know that.</p>
<p>Moving along, I develop for both iOS and Android and Android is becoming more and more competitive. It always gave you more freedom but only now has the UI and general fluidity come to a level, where that freedom can actually provide a better user experience. Android SDK is still a piece of rubbish, the profiling tools pale in comparison to iOS, but now I think it worth it and I am investing more and more development time on Android.</p>
<p>From a technical non-emotional point of view, I don&#8217;t really think Google can claim a lot of innovation with Android, but they have some good stuff. Google Now seems like a great product and innovative, so maybe now that Android has reach a great level of maturity, they will start innovating a lot more.</p>
<p>By the way, GC is a cancer. Give-me direct control of memory management or implement something like Apple&#8217;s ARC. Yes, I know it&#8217;s impossible since it&#8217;s Java based, but it&#8217;s actually JVM that brings down Android with all its ineficiency&#8230;. maybe in Android 7.0&#8230;..</p>
<p>PS: Direct memory management is harder to do, but from a perfomance point of view, I find it critical. Most of the times a application lags, it&#8217;s from GC_FOR_ALLOC messages&#8230; That&#8217;s why Apple disabled GC in iOS, while they have it on the Mac.</p>
<p>Love the Google Now UI. It&#8217;s a shame they do not use that same UI for the rest of Android. It would make Android look a lot better.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if Google Now takes into account Google searches on other devices?  i.e. Would my Google searches on Chrome on my Win7 machine be included in Google Now&#8217;s suggestions?  Or do I have to use the my Jelly Bean device for all searches?</p>
<p>From my experience with JB on my Nexus the &#8220;Card&#8221; feature develops from the Google Now searches on that device. The exception may be things like Google Maps locations. Not sure about sports. Any other search google tracks as normal and probably assists with future searches on all devices.</p>
<p>The Twins lost to the Royals even though they scored two more runs?</p>
<p>I am quite excited about the Google Now, but can anyone say how is the battery consumption with this feature? I believe we have to keep the location services turned ON.</p>
<p>Can we all start speculating on what Android 5.0 K_____ will be? I&#8217;m starting at Krispy Kreme.</p>
<p>Key Lime Pie.</p>
<p>Forgot about that. Thank you</p>
<p>People are barely on ICS. . . Actually almost no one is on ICS. Speaking in terms of the general public of course.</p>
<p>heh, I&#8217;ll never get JB on my Evo3D, that&#8217;s for sure.. :(</p>
<p>If you want Google&#8217;s software, buy one of Google&#8217;s phones, or don&#8217;t complain.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not against you, I just hate that people twist the existence of more than one Android phone (as opposed to only one Apple phone) into a negative, when it really means more choice for those who don&#8217;t care about updates (those who do have one choice, just like Apple customers &#8211; so no disadvantage there).</p>
<blockquote>If you want Google’s software, buy one of Google’s phones, or don’t complain.</blockquote>
<p>This is a terribly unhelpful viewpoint.</p>
<p>Well if you want the newest update then there is only one phone to buy. Isn&#8217;t that how it works with iOS on the iPhone?</p>
<p>Yes, but saying &#8220;if you don&#8217;t do X, then don&#8217;t complain&#8221; is not helpful for the community or platform as a whole. Constructive criticism, and a company&#8217;s ability to positively improve from it, is a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a viewpoint, it&#8217;s just how it is. Apple has one phone, Google has one phone. <br />
Constructive criticism is out of place here.</p>
<p>All the other Android phones are just additional choices, which Google isn&#8217;t responsible for. Faster updates would be nice, of course, but there is no &#8216;right&#8217; to complain to Google, as they really have nothing to do with it &#8211; Android is not just Google&#8217;s OS, it is an open source platform for others to &#8216;innovate&#8217; upon.</p>
<p>So, not only are complaints out of place, but even more, it is actually <strong>wrong </strong>to suggest that Google should &#8216;force&#8217; OEMs to update their phones.</p>
<p>This is because &#8216;forcing&#8217; OEMs to update their phones or remove skins is not what Android is about &#8211; in fact, it&#8217;s exactly the opposite of what Android is about. Android was designed as a &#8216;tool&#8217; to prevent monopolies (like iOS) that stifle innovation and as such, it must not be controlled, censored or whatever.</p>
<p>So, please, tell me what the downside would be to Google taking a more active approach in the future of the platform? No one is suggesting they &#8220;force&#8221; OEMs to do anything, but they should create ways for it to not even be an issue. You can deflect all you want, but it IS a problem for google, even if it does rest in OEMs hands, and as companies like Apple and MS use the issue to bolster their position, it will become a larger and larger problem. Looks like Google is trying to go the right direction with a PDK and the failed update alliance, so at least they&#8217;re actually trying, and not just running around making excuses like their cheerleaders are.</p>
<blockquote>So, not only is there no reason to complain, it is even <strong>wrong</strong></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re already doing pretty much everything that is possible in that regard.<br />
Android was designed for compatibility from the ground up.</p>
<blockquote>but it IS a problem for google</blockquote>
<p>No, it is not.</p>
<blockquote>and as companies like Apple</blockquote>
<p>who are years behind even compared to outdated Android versions like Gingerbread&#8230;</p>
<blockquote> and MS</blockquote>
<p>who are even further behind and having <strong>real </strong>problems behind the scenes, because of their &#8220;promise&#8221; to update phones (i.e. everybody has to wait until even the last WP7 phone is ready, which causes <strong>even longer delays</strong>, although you don&#8217;t notice because it&#8217;s simply not announced).</p>
<p>Quote fail :-(</p>
<p>Plus, let me add that running an outdated version is not that much of a problem if it&#8217;s still better than the newest versions from the competition&#8230; we should <strong>stop measuring by version numbers</strong> and start comparing features.</p>
<blockquote>who are years behind even compared to outdated Android versions like Gingerbread…</blockquote>
<p>See, now you&#8217;re just sounding like an idiot.</p>
<p>No, just having fun watching people&#8217;s reactions when they get confronted with the cold, hard truth.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with which OS is better. I happen to disagree with you re iOS vs Android but that&#8217;s not the point (and besides, I think it&#8217;s more a matter of personal preference).</p>
<p>The point is, in the words of Steve Ballmer, &#8220;developers developers developers&#8221;. I&#8217;m willing to accept that the Android ecosystem offers users more choice in the way of devices and OSes but the current fragmentation isn&#8217;t benefiting anyone and in the long run is going to hurt users (it actually already is).</p>
<p>Why? Because trying to develop for all the devices and OSes out there in the wild is near impossible. The average  TTM for an Android app vs the same app on iOS is much much larger and the quality will usually be lower because you have to appeal to the lowest common denominator in order to support the most devices. Add to that the monetization problems on Android (users are far less willing to pay for content and even consume less free content than iOS users) and for many developers except perhaps vey large and wealthy companies &#8211; the ROI for developing for Android simply isn&#8217;t worth it. Despite the larger market share, most of us would rather invest our resources into improving our iOS version.</p>
<p>The future of mobile is no longer about one OS or another &#8211; it&#8217;s about content and services. Android needs these just as much as iOS otherwise its users will bail. And in order to get them it needs developers on board who are receiving worthwhile compensation for their efforts. Currenty that&#8217;s not the case, at least compared to iOS.</p>
<p>To claim that users shouldn&#8217;t complain if they didn&#8217;t buy a Google phone or that this isn&#8217;t even Google&#8217;s concern is condescending and missing the point entirely. Most consumers have never even heard of Froyo, Gingerbread, ICS or Jellybean. Many (esp. Samsung users) don&#8217;t even know what Android is. All they know is that they bought a cool touch-thingy-phone that someone (probably their carrier) recommended to them but for some reason Temple Run crashes every time they launch it. Do you really think the best way to fix this is to simply berate them for being &#8220;dumb&#8221; and not buying a Nexus? I can&#8217;t see how making it their fault will win back their love.</p>
<p>Google can claim that upgrades aren&#8217;t their responsibility but that&#8217;s just burying their heads in the sand. It&#8217;s definitely their concern and I&#8217;m sure they think about it a lot &#8211; because if this fragmentation continues and spirals out of control, users and developers will either  abandon Android or it&#8217;ll simply split into incompatible flavours maintained separately by each OEM. I doubt that&#8217;s a future they want to see (which is maybe why they bought Motorola&#8230;).</p>
<p>Good points except&#8230;</p>
<p>I travel quite a bit around the US for work. I also have deep connections in open source communities going back to the early 90&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t  know many developers who don&#8217;t universally agree that the biggest issue is not the monetization of apps on iOS or Google Play, but how to get noticed in a sea of 600,000+ apps &amp; growing daily. Apples curation efforts miss just as many good apps as Google&#8217;s open ended approach so it&#8217;s not exclusive. You cannot simply make  a decent app then release to Apple or Google &amp; suddenly see big money flowing in the bank acct. It takes time to get noticed, if you are lucky (most good to great indie developers are expert self promoters) &amp; even more time to get paid a livable wage for your efforts. The reality is app deveolpemnt for most, my best guess is 95% of all developers in these app ecosystems, is that they fail or it&#8217;s a very liited part time income.</p>
<p> Like it or not there is a reason the big software publishers are still around &amp; not going away anytime soon.  And this coming from somebody who used to be heavily involved in the old BBS days with a profiatble board &amp; wrote lots of shareware. But reality of ever increasing costs coupled by lack of promotion &amp; distribution made me take other avenues. Distribution, regerdless of the Android-iOS-Windows build on the phone being used isn&#8217;t so much the issue as getting noticed is. Otherwise the besy app ever is just floating aimlessly at sea in the respective app store.</p>
<p>Oh &amp; my daughters ultra cheap LG Lucid runs Temple Run flawlessly.  Somehow I suspect there aren&#8217;t too many of Samsungs phones it&#8217;s crahsing on constantly.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re missing the point. Google doesn&#8217;t control what the device manufacturers/carriers do with each device that makes it to market, except for the Nexus devices.</p>
<p>Each hardware manufacturer is beholden to the carriers. If Verizon decides not to pick up a particular HTC device, it&#8217;s a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars for HTC. Android is open source, so many hardware manufacturers use it to base their software on, but in the end they have to cater to whatever the carriers demand. It&#8217;s been noted several times that carriers demand differentiation &#8211; which you and I read as fragmentation. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s what sells phones in the retail stores.</p>
<p>Google has tried using every carrot it can to practice more control because it doesn&#8217;t have a stick to make everyone fall in line. They literally cannot stop manufacturers from building devices and not updating them with the latest and greatest. Google&#8217;s only recourse it to keep putting out devices that set the gold standard and hope the market reacts by demanding equal or better from rival devices.</p>
<p>What else would you have them do?</p>
<p>So answer this if Apple can update all their one phone around the world with in a few days. How come Google can not update their one phone outside the US since it is their phone.</p>
<p>Carriers.</p>
<p>iOS Monopoly? Not in Smartphones that is for sure it started at 0 <br />
I guess in tablets you can say it has had a monopoly and if you do iOS vs Android, yes iOS Has the larger market penetration can that really be called a monopoly?</p>
<p>If by only one phone you mean the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone 4, the iPhone 4S, the iPod touch, and two generations of iPad, all able to update on the day that the OS is released.</p>
<p>Like Google updating the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus at the same time. Nice try though.</p>
<p>All 1Products use the same software and have the same basic inner workings. The only difference between the iPods/Phones is the lack of cellular radio.</p>
<p>Same &#8216;software&#8217;  but you also have to kill 700meg downloads for each of the devices, as its the same, but a little different.</p>
<p>But then, google can update nexus devices on day one, but only for the USA.  Hi ho google, there are other countries out there who ahve been purchasing your devices.</p>
<p>Not sure if the iOS 5 to iOS 6 upgrade will work this way, but all updates to iOS 5 have been downloadable from the device and are usually around 50meg.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s just the painful truth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the equivalent of &#8220;if you don&#8217;t like it, move&#8221; or &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have anything to hide, you shouldn&#8217;t worry about the government tapping your phone&#8221;.<br />
It&#8217;s intentionally dismissive, and serves only to distract from the actual problem.</p>
<p>But then there really isn&#8217;t a problem.</p>
<p>Most of your viewpoints are unhelpful as well. Do have something to add here?</p>
<p>Hopefully with a cusom rom considering that the 3d(cdma) has cm support.</p>
<p>*custom.</p>
<p>All well if people in the general public want Jelly bean or ICS they should figure it out like the rest of us.</p>
<p>No. Some of the general public doesn&#8217;t know any better but there is a segment that does want ICS/JB but may not have the time/expertise to do it &#8230; people can&#8217;t be arsed. They will just pick a different OS with a more curated experience on their next device.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so simple. OWN A NEXUS!</p>
<p>&#8230;Except on Verizon? I have no doubt that the only way I&#8217;ll see 4.1 in mid July is by making it happen myself.</p>
<p>I know, right?!</p>
<p>lol&#8230; The sprint nexus got ICS a month ago.</p>
<p>A nexus isn&#8217;t the be all answer!  The Nexus one was great but the Nexus S was poor  and the Galaxy Nexus made its worst offence again by not including a MicroSD slot!</p>
<p>The only version for sale in the UK is the 16GB verison which is pathetic.  32GB isn&#8217;t much better, I bought a 32GB card two freaking years ago.  I won&#8217;t even consider a Nexus again (I had the first one) until they sort that out.</p>
<p>The Nexus S wasn&#8217;t poor&#8230; though everything you&#8217;re spewing is all personal opinion and preference. You&#8217;re complaining that 32GB isn&#8217;t enough memory for your phone&#8230; local storage is dying. Get over it. Too much money is riding on &#8220;cloud&#8221; storage and services.</p>
<p>Most people in World are not too open to being corporate lap dogs with their information like in the states. They want to have their information not somebody else.</p>
<p>Local storage will die the day unlimited data plans return with no throttling or overage charges.</p>
<p>Next Never?</p>
<p>You can buy a class 10 64GB microSD card for £45-£55 depending on the day.  With that you don&#8217;t need a data connection or to suffer the much higher battery drain that streaming requires.  Don&#8217;t defend its removal, expandable memory is extremely useful.</p>
<p>I say the Nexus S is poor because it was rushed.  Basically a watered down Galaxy S (which launched 8 months prior!) and was missing the notification LED and MicroSD slot the Nexus one had. Two very useful features.  Then as if to prove Google have no idea what they are doing the button arrangement was different (no big deal, just embarrassing). <br />
 Watch the CES josh did with Matias Duarte when he was at Engadget. The Nexus S was a last minute thing and it shows.</p>
<p>i&#8217;ll have to tell you i love my nexus s i have to say though google shouldn&#8217;t do that again with the carrier specific nexuses. penta-band the damn thing and screw CDMA. i&#8217;m waiting for the next nexus to come out.</p>
<p>pardon?<br />
I love my Nexus S, I don&#8217;t have a single complaint about it.</p>
<p>Eww, no.</p>
<p>Subpar hardware mixed with great software = average phone. I rather just flash Jelly Bean on my One X and have a better foundation than the crappy GNexus.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to put JB into the beastly SGS III&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Organism@@ hoho@!!!!</p>
<p>Too bad that &#8216;superior&#8217; device won&#8217;t receive JB before a subpar GN.</p>
<p>Subpar hardware? I&#8217;ve owned the Galaxy Nexus for months now.. and I love it. The camera is the obvious down point of the phone, but it&#8217;s still good for camera on a phone. The camera doesn&#8217;t make the hardware subpar. I&#8217;d prefer having updates over the air from Google, than a better camera on say an SGS3.</p>
<p>The super quiet external speaker and creaky thin battery cover are killing my nexus for me. i consider it subpar when the par is the One X.</p>
<p>I use a nexus one. Device not exception to the rule.</p>
<p>I loved the shit out of my nexus one. That is until I wore out the power button and tried the DIY solder repair. It didn&#8217;t quite ever work again after that. :(</p>
<p>My 2 year old nexus s is by todays standards a dinosaur. Its a single core, average RAM, on.y clocked at 1ghz, and the screen spec is wayout of date. But its got software that is newer then the galaxy s3 that came out less then a month ago.</p>
<p>If you can do with out an SD slot, and will put up with some boring design, theres no phone like a nexus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always, well not always but for the last few years, been a little crazy to me that the same people that have championed the choice of android are now saying &#8216;&#8217;well, if you want the updates, then stick with nexus&#8217;&#8216;. There&#8217;s only 1 nexus per year, how is that any different than having 1 iphone per year? You have no choice.</p>
<p>I always thought that was the beauty of android and windows phone, choice. If you don&#8217;t like the build quality of samsung, or materials i should say, you&#8217;re free to go w/ moto, htc etc. If 4.65 is too big, you can go w/ 4.0&quot;.  If price is a concern for you, and you don&#8217;t wanna pay top dollar for the best SAMOLED+ HD screen or SLCD2 display, you can move down market to a price point where you&#8217;re more comfortable. But this &#8216;&#8217;if u want to stay up to date go w/ nexus&#8217;&#8217; is really a troubling path that i&#8217;m pretty sure android as a whole doesn&#8217;t want to go down.</p>
<p>Android already went down that path.</p>
<p>I think what those people mean by saying &#8220;buy Nexus&#8221; is that if you truly care about having the latest version of Android on your phone, then the Nexus line is what you should buy. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re saying no one should buy a One X or an SGSIII, but buyers need to think about what they really want from their phone when spending hundreds of dollars and signing a two year deal. For some, the hardware and features of a non-Nexus device might be what they&#8217;re looking for, but they shouldn&#8217;t be surprised that they&#8217;re not getting quick, direct updates from Google. If you can deal with certain things missing, but care more about stock, upgrade-able Android (I fall into this camp), you should buy a Nexus.</p>
<p>I do wish that all phone manufacturers could push out updates immediately, but due to the fine line Google has to walk with carriers/OEMs/customers, I think they&#8217;re doing all they can to deliver timely updates. I&#8217;m not a OS programmer so I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s possible, but it&#8217;d be nice if Android could somehow be installed in a similar fashion as Windows: installing the OS over a standardized BIOS/kernel that communicates with the hardware making it easier to upgrade without recoding every single aspect of a particular device. Again, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s even possible, but it would be nice.</p>
<p>Alright then&#8230; so go wait for them with open arms. In the mean time gtfo!</p>
<p>So Google should just wait until everyone got ICS? <br />
Surely not. <br />
It&#8217;s not there fault that Samsung and the others want to cook their own meal. <br />
I for my part never ever buy a non Nexus phone again.</p>
<blockquote>I for my part never ever buy a non Nexus phone again.</blockquote>
<p>only the gsm version&#8230;..otherwise might as well own a brick from 1996!</p>
<p>I live in Europe so no need for another version.</p>
<blockquote>I for my part never ever buy a non Nexus phone again.</blockquote>
<p>Just learn to put your own ROM on it. I&#8217;ll still buy the best hardward available and then just put custom ROMs on it. Get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been flashing roms since WinMo but its still not a solution to the problem at hand really.  Typically unless the ROM has really matured, which if your trying to get the latest and greatest Android version is almost never, your still going to have lots of issues. FC&#8217;s here and there and just random quirks. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I am going to continue flashing for a long time. but they are never 100% unless its a CM7/9 that has really really been vetted.</p>
<p>ICS was a major overhaul of the system (hence 4.0), it needs graphics acceleration which is sometimes hard to provide with old chipsets.<br />
JB is just a minor update, looks like it doesn&#8217;t need much low level development. Those with ICS will likely be able to run JB</p>
<p>Android devices will be divided in 2 categories: pre-ICS, post-ICS</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on ICS since December, so it&#8217;s high time for 4.1 in my opinion.</p>
<p>Also, nearly 10 % are on 4.0, which is after all 40 million people.</p>
<p>you mean 5%. and after all a negligible amount.</p>
<p>A couple months ago it was 7% so I doubt the number has gone down by now. In fact, ever since AT&amp;T and T-Mobile released ICS updates for the S2, the share of ICS devices on my apps went up to 13%.</p>
<p>7 is not &#8220;nearly&#8221; 10.</p>
<p>So over 20 million people then. Sorry.</p>
<p>Stop using the number as if the fact that it is a large number is supposed to be impressive. It is 7% of users, that is poor.</p>
<p>You need some perspective. It&#8217;s a new mobile OS not the cure for cancer and the VAST majority of the population doesn&#8217;t give a shit what version of any OS they&#8217;re using. They want a phone that works, takes pictures, play angry birds and look at facebook. They upgrade every 2 years and stay with what they have unless an update is pushed OTA. For the crying nerds like yourself you can install a custom ROM and have what you want.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re on the Verge right now&#8230; if we are only supposed to talk about things equal to a cure for cancer or things that the majority of the population give a crap about they might as well shut the site down right now.</p>
<p>Short version, it is a total firstworldproblem, as is 99.5% of the content on this site.</p>
<p>7 is an old number and it probably is at 10% now.</p>
<p>Yea I am pretty sure its at 10% or higher with all the sales of HOX, HOS and GSIII</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re saying Google should stop improving so fast to wait for carriers to update? LOL</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Microsoft has been doing with WP7 and why they were unable to catch up &#8211; until they finally cut the cord with WP8.</p>

<p>7% of 400.000,000 are on ICS. But your right almost no one is on ICS.</p>
<p>This is versus <strong>80%</strong> of 365,000,000 iOS devices being on iOS 5.  So <strong>yes</strong>, almost no one is on it.</p>
<p>You know that mathematically, comparing a large number with a substantially larger number does not actually make the first number any closer to zero right?</p>
<p>Or buy a Nexus device. If you want upgrades right away that is.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be sad, it just version number with small changes.</p>
<blockquote>Actually almost no one is on ICS.</blockquote>
<p>Well in a couple of week when the Nexus 7 ships millions of people will be using Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m anticipating deep fried oreo cookie.</p>
<p>Krispy Kreme is a registered name.</p>
<p>Kool-Aid. The Android mascot could hang with the Kool-Aid man, maybe bust down some walls.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s been serving up the &#8220;Kool-Aid&#8221; since it launched Android.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always a bad Apple in every bunch.</p>
<p>That bad Apple turns into Android.</p>
<p>This makes no sense.</p>
<p>Your right! They absolutely copied Apple who serves more &#8220;Kool Aid&#8221; than anybody!</p>
<p>Oh yeah!</p>
<p>Can we call it Krack?</p>
<p>&#8220;Cake&#8221;</p>
<p>I found it impressive that they seem to have created a far more useful version of Siri without ripping off anything about it.</p>
<p>Or a far more useful version of the already useful voice search/actions without any pretentious/over-hyped advertising that came with Siri. I routinely find that I can consistently ask my Gnex to do things that Siri can&#8217;t on my wife&#8217;s 4s. Obviously Siri is better at parsing natural language, but for many similar queries current Android won out.</p>
<p>FIFY: &#8220;Siri <strong>was</strong> better at processing natural language.&#8221;</p>
<p>How can you possibly say &#8220;was&#8221; still? There are no real comparisons here.</p>
<p>Well, Siri was better at it. I can ask it a question in normal english, and it gives me a normal english result.</p>
<p>Now, though, voice actions have pulled very strongly ahead.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t possibly say that though with any sort of actual information beyond your personal dedication to all things Google.<br />
You saw a few basic, command like voice searches on stage.<br />
There was no indication that Google Search is better than Siri at recognizing and properly parsing natural language.</p>
<p>Siri&#8217;s strength is not in it&#8217;s ability to hear your voice and produce search results based on what you said, it&#8217;s in it&#8217;s ability to know that when you say &#8220;do I need an umbrella this afternoon&#8221; it is a query for a weather forecast, or when you say &#8220;remind me to take out the trash when I get home&#8221; you want a geo-fence based reminder triggered at your home address. Siri is more than search.</p>
<p>The future is not in the software&#8217;s ability to give you better search results or respond to commands, it is in the software&#8217;s ability to understand what you mean, even if you don&#8217;t say it explicitly, and for it to be able to do so for many tasks, not just search related things. Siri isn&#8217;t 100% there either, but it&#8217;s still ahead of Google in it&#8217;s ability to parse and understand natural conversational language.</p>
<p>This is a good articulation of the difference in purpose between the two. Personally, I&#8217;d rather be able to flawlessly and consistently get the results I want using a subset of defined commands than to have the software attempt to parse conversational English and give hit or miss results. I do like that Siri can (once in a while) pull out the relevant results and present them right there in the window (vs. opening a google search in the browser for every request), but the consistency just isn&#8217;t there. I&#8217;ll be very happy if the improved Google voice search/actions can do this well.</p>
<p>On iOS I get both.<br />
The Google Search app has voice search.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, one of Siri&#8217;s strengths also became a weakness, it is also a learning system, and it improves with use; unfortunately, people can be stupid sometimes, and tainted the results (I believe the same thing is happening with Google search being tainted by social feeds). Maybe Apple has a reset button, or hopefully as more people use it, it will get smarter again.</p>
<p>And yet based on those same few tech demos you can so easily dismiss the voice actions because of your personal dedication to Apple?</p>
<p>Troll away.</p>
<p>Key Lime Pie will not be Android 5.0 it will be Android 4.2</p>
<p>They should have just called Android 4.1  Peanut Butter.</p>
<p>YESS 60fps everywhere!!</p>
<p>yea, that&#8217;s amazing! but the name is really awful!!! ^^</p>
<p>How? It&#8217;s  simple to understand for those of us that hear it, and the vast majority of consumers will never hear it&#8230;</p>
<p>Come on now, it&#8217; gonna be smooth as butta</p>
<p>About time really! This is way overdue.</p>
<p>Who knows give them some time and they&#8217;ll make some nice transitions too.</p>
<p>Yes this is off topic. But want to see a awful transition. Send an email through the mail hub on Windows 8. It is the most horrendous thing I have ever seen.</p>
<p>LMFAO</p>
<p>RETINA FPS :D</p>
<p>retina fps? really?</p>
<p>what does that even mean</p>
<p>Retna frames per second? Have a sneaking suspicion that Apple uses 120Hz displays to achieve their smoothness.</p>
<p>I believe he is just jabbing at Apple Marketing.</p>
<p>I think that was a snarky remark about Apple&#8217;s problem with smooth framerates on the Retina MBP and iPad 3.</p>
<p>Fake edit: hey, the new beta of iOS brought inline spell check.</p>
<blockquote>Have a sneaking suspicion that Apple uses 120Hz displays to achieve their smoothness.</blockquote>
<p>In that case you would be very wrong.  In fact it&#8217;s so silly I actually laughed.</p>
<p>exactly&#8230;what does that mean.</p>
<p>oooh<br />
magic</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for it to be on my Galaxy Nexus.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t this just prove that ICS and al the versions before it were laggy?</p>
<p>NO no no, they were all acceptably smooth</p>
<p>Difference between being laggy and appearing laggy.</p>
<p>That makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>yes it does in a way. Choppy animations appear laggy, but dont really slow you down in reality. Being laggy means there is lag when you click something and something actually happening. Appearing laggy is more to do with visuals, being laggy is in regards to time.</p>
<p>My Xoom was laggy in all respects pre-ICS.  Post-ICS not laggy.</p>
<p>Exactly. It always bothers me when people refer to choppiness as &#8220;lag.&#8221; Lag would be if you swiped to scroll and it hesitated before actually scrolling. It could be perfectly smooth and still be laggy.</p>
<p>That may be you definition. It&#8217;s not mine.</p>
<p>Then you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just his definition. It&#8217;s the definition.</p>
<p>Low FPS is not lag, it&#8217;ts choppy.  BUT,  finger tracking delay, the other half of the coin they dropped, is lag.</p>
<p>pseudo-troll? This is false cause aka correlation != causation aka <em>cum hoc ergo propter hoc</em>. Because something was improved may or may not imply that it was flawed.</p>
<p>No. ICS was the introduction of &#8216;no lagg&#8217;. I was surprised that Google don&#8217;t mind throwing that &#8216;feature&#8217; under the bus so quickly by calling it out and showing it against their new OS in a slow mo demo.</p>
<p>Like when the retina iPad came and trounced all over the old one.</p>
<p>Everyone on Nexus devices (the clever people) are cool as they&#8217;ll get this new OS today. Everyone else is shafted. It&#8217;s that whole can&#8217;t unsee what I&#8217;ve now seen idea.</p>
<p>Fair point. I&#8217;m just saying &#8220;doesn&#8217;t this just prove that ICS and all the versions before it were laggy&#8221; is a logical fallacy.<p>Lag in versions &lt;4.0 can be demonstrated; further  proof isn&#8217;t needed, and if it was this wouldn&#8217;t be it.</p></p>
<p>Kinda like saying doesn&#8217;t Crysis 2 prove that Crysis looked bad. All the devices have some degree of &#8220;lag,&#8221;  whats important is that the situation keeps getting improved.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t one of the big problems in that regard that Apps targeting Pre-Honeycomb versions of Android did not use Hardware accelerated rendering? You could force them to do so using a setting but some Apps would have bugs with this setting.</p>
<p>Any word on wether they adressed this as most Apps are still targeted towards the older Android versions?</p>
<p>Even the smoothest ICS device has demonstrable lag next to a last gen iOS device. That&#8217;s what is important, the fact that they are still behind the competition.</p>
<p><img src="http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/dynamic/imgs/091207/Big-Bang-Theory-Gorilla_320.jpg" /></p>
<p>I know right, like ICS wasn&#8217;t smooth already! LOL</p>
<p>It ISN&#8217;T. I&#8217;ve used it daily since launch, and the little hiccups are frustrating.</p>
<p>sorry are you on stock ROM? I&#8217;m used to custom ROMs, they&#8217;ve been buttery smooth for me. Try it yourself, but you&#8217;ll probably say its too hard. Wait for Jelly Bean then!</p>
<p>Custom ROMs are not a solution. A device should just be smooth. A lot of people can&#8217;t be arsed to mess about their device just to get it to work as advertised.</p>
<p>FYI, I have TF101 &#8230; stock Asus ICS on it &#8230; it lags and stutters. Also, apparently FlipBoard not comparable with my device. Am I going to go out of the way to root it, install custom ROM and mess about to get it to not stutter/run properly &#8230; hell, no. Can&#8217;t be arsed.</p>
<p>Whoa there&#8230;custom roms may not be a solution FOR YOU. But for those of us that take pride in modding our systems, it is more than acceptable.</p>
<p>Custom roms are not a solution for problems with Android. The Open Handset Alliance cannot rely on the enthusiast community to solve their problems.</p>
<p>Tell that to the Linaro team.</p>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s what aku was saying: not that custom roms don&#8217;t work for some, but that they certainly should not be relied upon to work for all.</p>
<p>Custom ROMs should not be used to FIX issues as is often the case with Android devices. Instead they should be used to improve, personalize and make your device a better fit for you if you choose to put in the time. However, most of the time the knee jerk answer to &#8220;I have such and such issue with my &#8230;&#8221; is &#8220;Put such and such custom ROM&#8221;. No, my device should work out of the box. My HTC Desire was just a broken device from start to end, my TF101 is good most of the time but hardly perfect &#8230; this has to end. People will move to move curated OS experiences as I have.</p>
<p>Well technically they aren&#8217;t buttery smooth, just margariney smooth.</p>
<p>More like crunchy peanut butter smooth&#8230;</p>
<p>hahaha NO</p>
<p>Indeed, but, at least Google has finally realised that UI&#8217;s should be consistently  smooth and fluid.</p>
<p>Until the carriers get a hold of it.</p>
<p>And OEMs&#8230;</p>
<p>LG can&#8217;t wait to get their hands on it and bring a whole new generation of lags and crashes.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, the bane of the end users. Man, with ICS (and now with JB&#8217;s further refinements) Google is slowly elevating Android above the shitheap it used to be but OEM&#8217;s and the networks just can&#8217;t keep their dirty hands off it.</p>
<p>Non non non my friend, Ice Cream Sandwich is smooth , but Jelly Bean is Buttery Smoooooth, say it with me &#8216;Buttery Smooooth&#8217; make sure you pout as you enunciate the &#8216;smoooooth&#8217;</p>
<p>Well, ICS isn&#8217;t laggy on my Nexus. Yes it&#8217;s a custom ROM, but it&#8217;s still ICS. And it&#8217;s doing a hell of a lot more than stock ICS from Google. So no, I don&#8217;t think ICS is slow or laggy, but Gingerbread and before definitely were.</p>
<p>&gt; Yes it&#8217;s a custom rom</p>
<p>shush.</p>
<p>Gruber?</p>
<p>offline voice recognition, ok, I love you google.</p>
<p>Totally &#8211; this was one of my &#8220;Wow&#8221; moments, where I actually found myself saying it out loud (on my own in a hotel room)</p>
<p>I had to wait until the end of April for ICS on my Sensation, and now Jelly Bean is out. I&#8217;m always a step behind =[</p>
<p>You and most other android users.</p>
<p>I had to wait 3 days after buying my Sensation before I found a suitable ROM on XDA-devs. I know I know not everyone is down for that. But I am pretty sure I will have JB on this phone (or whatever my next is) within a couple weeks of its release into the AOSP.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a complete novice (read: never done any rooting, ever), but I&#8217;m considering learning. Was the Sensation difficult to do?</p>
<p>(NOVICE)</p>
<p>Sensation is awesomely easy to do now that XDA&#8217;s released their All-in-one service kit.</p>
<p>And once you do it once, you know how to do it over and over and over again until you get the perfect setup that you&#8217;ve always dreamed about.</p>
<p>I bought a desire HD / Inspire 4g like 3 months ago and put an ICS AOKP Rom on it. Have been pretty sad that they still didn&#8217;t have really good camera drivers for it, and still getting some FCs ( think it was IceColdSandwich), so I bit the bullet and bought a galaxy nexus as soon as the price dropped on the play store today. So Exicted!</p>
<p>And by most&#8230;93%</p>
<p>Could&#8217;ve had a nexus!</p>
<p>At the time that I was renewing my contract the Galaxy Nexus wasn&#8217;t available, since my contract was June time. I&#8217;m thinking about it though!</p>
<p>Butter and Jelly Beans — I think I just got a stomach ache.</p>
<p>Oh god ugh why did you have to give me that image</p>
<p>What, buttered popcorn jelly beans?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re better than you think</p>
<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vKSBC1FwOZk/S1Djk2RWKiI/AAAAAAAAARU/PtLAx6Q2CPk/s400/jelly_belly_buttered_popcorn_bulk.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend this, but I simply cannot recommend this.</p>
<p>Cool, Android just implemented IntelliscreenX from iPhone jailbreak :)</p>
<p>You&#8217;re kidding, right?</p>
<p>Not at all.<br />
Quick replies, expandable notifications, etc. All available in IntelliscreenX for a year now. Good on Google though, because those are very good enhancements.</p>
<p>Well jailbreak devs got pull down notifications from Android so&#8230;</p>
<p>If you really want to start a &#8220;they copied it first&#8221; kind of pissing contest, you may want to still wait a few years when the list may grow beyond one feature.</p>
<p>You actually started it&#8230;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Cool&#8221; in my reply wasn&#8217;t actually sarcastic. It is a cool capability, and as I said in the very next comment &quot;those are very good enhancements&#8217;. The difference is I was just giving credit where it&#8217;s due, instead of championing google for some pointless reason.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re much too non-chalant for being right and not being an asshole at the same time. What&#8217;s wrong with you?</p>
<p>shit just got real.</p>
<p>look. it&#8217;s all downhill after Froyo. Why? cuz that&#8217;s the phone I paid good money for and i ain&#8217;t buyin another one: :p.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the Siri Competition</p>
<p>my thought exactly &#8230; at first i was thinking maybe they&#8217;ll develop something to counter Siri&#8230; then i was surprised that they just snuck it into search&#8230;. genius i tell ya!</p>
<p>Of course it is going to be in search. That is there Bread and BUTTER.</p>
<p>OH NO! Your phone is going to talk back to you! I thought that was just a gimmick?</p>
<p>The ability of hypocrisy&#8230;.definitely a human only quality.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get why some people didn&#8217;t see the point of Siri.  It may not have been perfect, but it was functional.</p>
<p>Better issue to unfold will be which is better&#8230;.</p>
<p>A win all around now that Apple has some serious competition.</p>
<p>No, you asking your phone to tell you a joke is a gimmick.  Acknowledging a command isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And you can use Siri every single day without asking it a joke question if you want. The system as a whole is a gimmick because it can do one thing with a programmed personality, and still do everything else the &#8220;non gimmick&#8221; product can do?<br />
That&#8217;s just fanboy validation bullshit.</p>
<p>I never said that Siri is a gimmick, only that it has one.  You&#8217;re the one that generalized voice response as a gimmick.  I was just clarifying that there is a difference between responding with a joke and acknowledging what I just asked for.</p>
<p>The UI is looking really nice.  I always considered Android butt-ugly, but they apparently hired some people with style-sense.</p>
<p>You must have missed out on ICS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with @deepcover. I thought ICS had a fairly ugly aesthetic too, but I&#8217;m liking what I see in Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Yea Jelly Bean seems to be a more refined look. Like they gave ICS some braces, hair extensions, laser hair removal and a shower.</p>
<p>Those icons are still gross.</p>
<p>I actually really like the stock ICS icons. What I don&#8217;t like is the inconsistent third party icons. That&#8217;s what is good about Apple&#8217;s (albeit tacky) everything is a shiny rounded rectangle. Home screens look consistent.</p>
<p>THEY ARE ALMOST THE SAME.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost the same. Sometimes I think people just crave a new OS just for the new wallpapers.</p>
<p>UI had Matias Duarte all over it</p>
<p>has*</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time</p>
<p>So much WebOS + awesomeness in Jelly Bean. Matias is a beast!</p>
<p>I think we can all agree on that! Matias did an AWESOME job on the UI</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call it pretty, but I thought he did a great job on honeycomb. It was &#8220;cool&#8221;, just not something you&#8217;d want to show off in public.</p>
<p>Offline voice input is huge, now it&#8217;s time for Apple to make that happen before iOS 6 launches.</p>
<p>Apple can&#8217;t compete with this. Google have far too much data to create this knowledge from. Google = Winner.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s data is irrelevant to offline voice input&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, I realize I&#8217;m in the minority, but Google having more information on me is NOT a good thing, IMO.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t use Google services&#8230; see how easy that was.</p>
<p>Still irrelevant to Offline voice input.</p>
<p>I believe the &#8216;data&#8217; that Schomozo was referring to was generic search data for the knowledge graph &#8211; this is not personalised data, it&#8217;s giving the data on the web context.  This still has nothing to do with offline voice input, but I&#8217;d be surprised if the context garnered from the knowledge graph wasn&#8217;t included in the natural language processing engine.  (Hands in the air, this is pure speculation, I&#8217;m not a Google engineer)</p>
<p>That would actually be an interesting feature for Microsoft to include, given that since Windows Vista offline Voice recognition was integrated into the system (it&#8217;s there in Windows 8 as well but it currently looks like Desktop only)&#8230;</p>
<p>They&#8217;d have to compact it down to phone size &#8211; Maybe I&#8217;m stuck in the past but Ms don&#8217;t have a great track record of making things &#8216;small and light&#8217;.</p>
<p>Would be interesting to have a look at Windows RT if it is included there. If it is, it already runs on the same Hardware the Windows 8 Phones will be using.</p>
<p>I am not sure about this but I think that MS stripped a lot of legacy code out of 7, hence the XP mode to get some shit to work. Possibly even more so with Win8</p>
<p>I think making offline voice input work is a technology problem solved by smart software engineers and not by the amount of user data a company has.</p>
<p>But how can you improve voice recognition without having voice to use?  I&#8217;m sure Google has been gathering voice samples for years through Voice Search and Google Voice.</p>
<p>Looks a bit too &#8220;Metro&#8221; for my tastes, but it&#8217;s very nice to see Google actually starting to care about design.</p>
<p>Agree completely. I could never understand why people said ICS looked good, but this, this looks nice.</p>
<p>I agree with egojab.</p>
<p>Interpol? Uh&#8230;ICS is still very much present. Mostly just some added UI elements that enhance what was already there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a minor difference, but things looked a lot more refined. At least in what they showed on stage — especially on the Nexus 7 tablet. Perhaps it was more the apps that they showed off?</p>
<p>Google now knows all, It sees all, It RULES ALL!!!. um I mean&#8230;</p>
<p>They copied the &#8216;hair joke&#8217; from WWDC. Cool.</p>
<p>This is making iOS6 look downright archaic.</p>
<p>This is true. <br />
Apple = your parents daily driver<br />
Android  = cool kids daily driver.</p>
<p>I would say cool kids don&#8217;t define themselves by what phone OS they use.</p>
<p>True. Maybe &#8216;edgier types&#8217;..?</p>
<p>No. I would just not define people by what operating system their mobile phone runs.</p>
<p>But google users are better&#8230;</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just trying to be edgy so I can fit in :(</p>
<p>Not &#8220;defined by&#8221;, but that&#8217;s just what they use.</p>
<p>Well, hopefully by 2014 enough people will be on JB to matter :)</p>
<p>Why do you keep hating!?!If your not using Android why should Android updates bother you</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not hating, and it doesn&#8217;t actually bother me, but it matters because I appreciate progress and improvement in tech. I may not use Android every day now, but I&#8217;m always open to it in the future, and improvements to any of the three major mobile OSes will inevitably drive progress in the others, and we all win.</p>
<p>FWIW, my lack of desire to use Android every day now has less to do with the platform, and more to do with my personal ideas being at odds with that of the company behind the platform. I can appreciate the capabilities and improvements of the Android platform, and still choose not to use it based on the poor (in my opinion) choices that Google is making in other areas.</p>
<p>Seems like a waste of energy to me&#8230; enjoy your day, and before I forget, happy Google kicks ass day! :-)</p>
<p>Appreciating progress sure seems like a more valuable use of time than just being a cheerleader.</p>
<p>Except you&#8217;re not appreciating progress&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d certainly appreciate if Google did something to make it a lot faster than that.</p>
<p>Trolling all day, trolling all night. Please stupid troll get outta my sight :-)</p>
<p>This place will be better when you go back to middle school in the fall.</p>
<p>Well go then. You could use some proper education.</p>
<blockquote>it doesn’t actually bother me</blockquote>
<p>20+ posts on this Android article alone, most of them adding nothing to the conversation? Clearly <strong>something&#8217;s</strong> bothering you.</p>
<p>Yeah, the idiots who think just posting a comment on a forum means something bothers me. That&#8217;s pretty bothersome to realize the Verge comments are quickly getting overrun with Youtube commenter quality preteen bullshit.</p>
<p>&#8230;by 2014 ICS will be the defacto OS for Android. Google doesn&#8217;t care about fragmentation.</p>
<blockquote>Google doesn’t care about fragmentation.</blockquote>
<p>This is true. But they <em>should</em>, and the fact that so many Verge users (and Android users elsewhere) defend Google for this, and don&#8217;t expect more, or better action on Google&#8217;s end, is kind of a sad situation where users are more invested in defending their team than in improving their platform of choice.</p>
<p>They should not. Just because you think they should doesn;t make it so. WP showed that fixing fragmentation does not work. It&#8217;s been holding back iOS for years now too.</p>
<p>Everybody with even half a brain can see that Google&#8217;s approach is working just fine. In fact it&#8217;s working best of all strategies currently in the market.</p>
<p>Just go back under your bridge. And stay there.</p>
<blockquote>Jelly Bean will be distributed as an over-the-air update from mid-July to the Galaxy Nexus, the Motorola Xoom, and the Nexus S.</blockquote>
<p>And sometime in late 2013 for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Based on how the last update went, expect Verizon to get it by September or October.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine so.</p>
<p>All I can do is cry. Was hoping not to have to root a nexus phone. Oh well.</p>
<p>uh&#8230;why did you even buy one then?</p>
<p>Pretty excited for the more informative notifications, this is what I was looking for!</p>

<p>Disturbing. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m all happy that my gnex will be getting a &#8220;butter smooth UI&#8221;, but to call that a new feature is sort of sad. A smooth UI isn&#8217;t a feature, it&#8217;s a minimum requirement in my opinion. I guess it&#8217;s nice that google is finally catching up on that front.</p>
<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ve been continuously disappointed in Android&#8217;s graphics system up to now. This update looks to finally address that.</p>
<p>Triple buffering is a feature. The tool for finding slowdowns is a feature. Butter smooth is the name of the project working on these things. They never claimed a smooth UI as a feature, ICS is very smooth. They simply stated that they have been working to make it <em>smoother</em><br />
I have a Gnex, my friend has a 4s. The 4s has just as many if not more slowdowns and stutters as the Gnex. And the 4s is frequently disappointing in terms of speed because of its lack of 4g. Something about a loading bar slowly creeping along to load a website just doesn&#8217;t scream &#8220;slick&#8221;.</p>
<p>Agreed. My GNexus with ICS runs 95% perfectly smooth (with very rare stutters) and I&#8217;m running a live wallpaper and several widgets. I&#8217;ll still be happy to get the update though and have it be even more smooth.</p>
<p>but it&#8217;s still not as smooth as ios, and you would know that if you had ever used an iphone for more than 1 minute. That was the point I was making.</p>
<p>To quote Josh: &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what I know&#8221;. I&#8217;ve used friends iPhones several time and I happen to own an iPad and use it regularly. There was definitely a noticeable difference between my OG Droid and iOS by the GNexus to me seems to be right on par with my iPad for smoothness and the GNexus is doing more.</p>
<p>flashed jelly bean on my galaxy nexus this morning and google delivered. ics was great, jelly bean is just better.</p>
<p>Sweet!</p>
<p>no no no. I have owned an iphone in one form or another since it came out, and I owned the iphone 4s. I now use a galaxy nexus. the difference in smoothness, whether it be scrolling or app loading, is significantly different between the two phones. you can stick your head in the mud and say the two platforms are equivalent, but they aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t used both platforms for significant amounts of time, then you don&#8217;t get to comment here. You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re missing if you&#8217;ve only ever used an android phone. If you spend significant time with an iphone, you will realize just how smooth and seamless everything in the system flows. I like my galaxy nexus, but it is not as smooth as ios, plain and simple. and it does bug me.</p>
<p>And I really don&#8217;t care how they make the operating system smoother. To my knowledge, Apple nor Windows have never made big announcements about some new technology they are using to speed up the UI. It&#8217;s always been taken for granted that these operating systems are smooth, and no big feature announcement was needed.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a minimum requirement, and Android didn&#8217;t have it before&#8230; then how do you already own an Android device?</p>
<p>&#8220;Project Butter is the major new innovation in Android 4.1, focused on making the entire UI &#8220;fast, fluid and smooth.&#8221;</p>
<p>RIIIIIIIIIIGHT. There&#8217;s some &#8220;feature&#8221; that Google says this about at nearly every I/O about every new version of Android. &#8220;We&#8217;ve gotten ride of the lag!&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s 50% faster now!&#8221; &#8220;There&#8217;s no more stuttering!&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay. We&#8217;ll see. And even if they do get it sorted out so that Android runs on a $600 phone the way it should, IT&#8217;S ABOUT EFFING TIME.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair. The Galaxy Nexus is $400 of contract, which is what they demoed.</p>
<p>Even at $349. As someone else said, it&#8217;s sad that a &#8220;fluid UI&#8221; is a &#8220;new feature&#8221; after four iterations of an OS. A fluid UI should be a basic requirement for any OS (or are we in 1978 again?).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a requirement, people these days just feel entitled to shit like this. Just because it looked like it was slower doesn&#8217;t mean it took any longer to process your touch when you were scrolling. The phone is faster because of Jelly Bean, the phone <em>looks</em> faster because of Project Butter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like WP clamoring over the fact that they have a separate camera button. Most phones no longer have these buttons because users don&#8217;t really care.</p>
<p>Same with this ridiculous obsession with &#8220;smoothness&#8221;. It&#8217;s a third tier priority so Google rightly did not focus too much on it at first.</p>
<blockquote>Android 4.1 Jelly Bean will be distributed as an over-the-air update from mid-July to the Galaxy Nexus&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>Except for VZW&#8217;s G&#8217;Nex, whose Jelly Bean OTA will come seven months later.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel bad. 1% of the 2% of Android phones currently on the market will get this update. It&#8217;s the Google way. Develop OS updates with new features, smile a lot, make cute videos about them, talk about how cool it is, and then never give a crap when .5% of your market&#8217;s devices are actually updated.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the JellyBean update rolls out by the end of July for MOST devices that got updated (or shipped with) ICS.</p>
<p>ICS was the milestone for faster updates. Updating ICS devices to JellyBean will be MUCH, MUCH, MUCH easier than updating Gingerbread to ICS.</p>
<p>Also, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if MOST OEMs already have the JellyBean source. It&#8217;s already launching with the Nexus7 tablet, which means it&#8217;s already &#8220;finished&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Hopefully &#8211; with Asus being the partner on the Nexus 7, the rest of the Asus line will follow suite pretty swiftly.  Fingers crossed for my TF101.</p>
<p>It only takes about a month or two, it just seems like forever becuase you really want the update. They just need to change the CDMA drivers and get rid of Google Wallet. They were originally going to release the VZW Galaxy Nexus a week earlier until they did real world testing and there was a flaw in the software that brought down the 4G network.</p>
<p>Edit: Or so verizon engineers suspected.</p>
<p>i feel bad for people that wait for OTAs on a nexus/google experience device.</p>
<p>Wahooo….my GSIII is now out of date…here is to waiting a year for AT&amp;T to update it.</p>
<p>Looks awesome. So happy I have a Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Loving what I see in the Jelly Bean update, and I&#8217;ve <em>hugely</em> disliked Android up to now. They&#8217;ve really gone in the right direction. I like how competitive this industry is.</p>
<p>&#8220;Project Butter is the major new innovation in Android 4.1, focused on making the entire UI &#8220;fast, fluid and smooth.&#8221;</p>
<p>oh good, I&#8217;m glad they&#8217;re getting around to this 10 versions in.</p>
<p>Project butter is not a feature. it&#8217;s the team behind the new UI speed improvements.</p>
<p>"The UI really is fast this time, not like the last one" – every release of Android ever,</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>Froyo is the first time I heard it, since then every update has been: &#8220;it&#8217;s like an iPhone now, last version sucked, we know we know, but THIS TIME it&#8217;s like the iPhone&#8221;.</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve never wanted my android phone to be like the iphone, it&#8217;s why i chose it in the first place.</p>
<p>and yes, ICS is leaps and bounds better than gingerbread.</p>
<p>Gingerbread was already better that iOS yes. Imagine how much better it is now.</p>
<p>i like my android devices but i would not say gingerbread is better than iOS.</p>
<p>Most people would though.</p>
<p>What improvements to the camera have been made?  I love my Galaxy Nexus except for the camera which takes awful pictures unless the subject is sitting completely still.</p>
<p>tempted to buy a galaxy nexus and use it on tmobile</p>
<p>If T-Mobile has good coverage in your area, go for it. Check out their monthly 4G plans (if you buy a cheap phone form walmart, you can get the $30 plan which is boss.</p>
<p>yea tmo has pretty good coverage in nyc&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.but idk i really dont wanna spend 350+ on a phone :/ gonna try and get tmobile to give me the gs3 for 199 lol</p>
<p>The thing is, you&#8217;ll end up paying less for the Galaxy Nexus because it&#8217;s off-contract. With the GS3, you end up paying a lot more for it over time.</p>
<p>How will he end up paying less?</p>
<p>Off contract plans are cheaper&#8230;</p>
<p>This is why I own a Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>My condolences.</p>
<p>The only way I&#8217;d own one is if it came with Exynos&#8230; OMAP4 = No bueno&#8230; PowerVR 540 is getting ANCIENT for crying out load.</p>
<p>If one of the upcoming Nexus phones gets either Exynos 5 Dual or Snapdragon S4 PRO, then I&#8217;m all in&#8230;</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t go overboard on useless specs. So you&#8217;ll never like a Nexus device. For the rest of the world, the Nexus is pretty much the best device available though.</p>
<p>They should market it more, but I guess Google don&#8217;t really want to upset their partner too much.</p>
<p>Funny how the RAGE over Windows 7 to Windows 8 is not felt for ICS to JB. Fanboys be fanboys I guess</p>
<p>What is there to rage over? The Galaxy Nexus is going to be getting Jelly Bean in July (not Fall) and that device came out before the Lumia 900. Jelly Bean also doesn&#8217;t have quite the same potential to kill app&#8217;s backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>You were right about one thing though, <em>fanboys will be fanboys</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not raging because of either. But for those who &#8220;hate&#8221; Windows 8, it&#8217;s Metro they hate because of the huge change of UI language from the traditional desktop to Metro, and/or removing the old start menu. I think everyone&#8217;s over-reacting about Windows 8 though because it&#8217;s basically the same Windows (you can always revert back to the desktop) but instead of a start menu you have &#8220;tiles&#8221; now&#8230; I love it myself.</p>
<p>That said, the difference between Windows7-8 and Android 4.0-4.1 is very different. Jellybean is an incremental update that improves both the performance and UI of Android ICS and also adds more features. All welcome features and improvements that everyone wanted. There wouldn&#8217;t be any reason why anyone would &#8220;hate&#8221; it, pretty much on the contrary.</p>
<p>Google: &#8220;The .03% of Android users who own a Galaxy Nexus will get 4.1 in July. Everyone else? We don&#8217;t know, and we certainly don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

<p>You should see someone about that, monkey boy.</p>
<p>Name calling monkey boy after a GIF of a black guy just looks &#8230;. wrong?</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.head-fi.org/3/3c/300x306px-LL-3caa55d0_RykerClapping.gif" /></p>
<p>Wow that clean look in google now, reminds me of metro and wp7, nice job android team!</p>
<p>Seems like a webos and ics had a baby duarte style.</p>
<blockquote>from Jelly Bean onwards, paid apps will be delivered with a device-specific key</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean exactly?</p>
<p>Install Google Wallet now, because you can&#8217;t copy apks around anymore.</p>
<p>Only paid apps are extracted. You&#8217;ll still be able to move apks around.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s meant to stop piracy.</p>
<p>There goes the appeal of Android for many :)</p>
<p>TBH many apps were using the Licensing module already, which did a similar job as to what they announced today, but unlike Jelly Bean&#8217;s key encryption thing, it required changes in the app.</p>
<p>So the pirates were already having a tough time, now it will be even harder as Google uses encryption across ALL paid apps.</p>
<p>You think that Google won&#8217;t encrypt Wallet to appease VZW?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll still be able to install paid apps on all your devices through the Play Store, right?</p>
<p>Project butter&#8230; something ios has done since 2007 lol</p>
<p>At the expense of literally pausing everything when touch occurs&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a nice upgrade. But, iOS has its own set of issues and making a snarky comment about Android is pointless unless they&#8217;re both perfect.</p>
<p>Not&#8230;. having held 2 iphones 3g in my hand today, its smooth like a ride on stairs</p>
<p>can&#8217;t wait for the JB 4.1 update though&#8230; i think i will like my GNex again&#8230; :)</p>
<p>XDA Devs &gt; OEM &gt; Carriers</p>
<p>Flashing my One X &gt; OTA GNexus</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funny is the GNex will have the OTA even before you get your One flashed.</p>
<p>True, but when I do flash Jellybean, my One X will be better, faster and stronger than the GNex.</p>
<p>That phone is a true letdown. The only thing going for it is OTA straight from Google.</p>
<p>Yeah I don&#8217;t regret getting my Nexus back in December but if the One X was out at the time, it would have been a no-brainer.</p>
<p>even if you owned the thunderbolt?</p>
<p>the thunderbolt killed any chance of me buying another HTC phone.</p>
<p>Not at all. I had the HD2 before the Nexus and LOVED it. HTC ftw.</p>
<p>Yeah. A seven month old phone not being as good as one released more recently&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yeah let&#8217;s hope that doesn&#8217;t become a regular thing now.</p>
<p>too much logic, i can&#8217;t handle it!</p>
<p>besides, it&#8217;s not like these quad cores are going to have much use anyway. Unless you are playing games, the CPU barely breaks a sweat on a Gnex. Most of the time it&#8217;s on 300Mhz or 700Mhz anyway.</p>
<p>A seven-month-old phone that is even inferior to the Galaxy S2, which is a 12-13 month-old phone in all aspects but the screen (debatable)&#8230;</p>
<p>It IS a let-down to many. Before the Galaxy S3, NOTHING ran stock ICS smoother than the Galaxy S2&#8230;</p>
<p>The new functions of the camera are copies of the WP7.</p>
<p>Which were not original concepts at the time. So what?</p>
<p>But were they present on commercial smartphones? I think not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m confident with the &#8220;manufacturer&#8221; preview version available for partners 2/3 months prior release will cut by half or more the deployment of JB. in case the phone is within the 18 months support agreement betwheen the manufacturer an Google.</p>
<p>That 18 month support agreement is bullshit, especially when contracts are 24month at length. By the time you get the update, your already wanting out of your current phone or your contract. Google should cut that down to 6 &#8211; 9 months, 6 months perfectible.</p>
<p>If OEM can crank out several different phones a month with Froyo or Gingerbread builds on tap, they can make less phones and focus on upgrading (if hardware possible) the ones already out in consumers hands. Google REALLY needs to drive this topic at home.</p>
<p>It was guidance, not a requirement. And, if the <strong>hardware</strong> partners had to put more focus in keeping their devices up to date with the latest <strong>software</strong>, there&#8217;d be less devices to choose from.</p>
<p>what cyanogen mod is in the houseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\</p>
<p>I bought my nexus s 2 years ago and it is more up to date then the galaxy s 3 that came out less then a month ago.</p>
<p>Gonna wait for CM10/AOKP/Gummy to incorporate Jellybean myself before I commit to making it my daily driver. Custom ROMs just give so much more than default Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,, when you want to slide your widget around, icons will rearrange themselves automatically&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.hahaha, take your time already</p>
<p>Jelly Bean for Nexus S you say?  Oh Yeah.</p>
<p>Wow it only took them 4 years or something to figure out that Android lags &amp; stutters.</p>
<p>Better late than never I guess but jeez, it really is about time.</p>
<p>Tried a Galaxy Nexus yesterday in the mall &#8211; the stuttering, lagging slide to unlock switch was a huge turn off from the get go. No way I am paying money for this! It&#8217;s 2012, and the slide to unlock switch on an iPhone has not lagged from day one, 5 years ago. Its attention to detail that&#8217;s lacking.</p>
<p>The real problem is that the hardware in the Galaxy Nexus is terribly underpowered for the screen resolution it&#8217;s running.</p>
<p>No, the real problem is thousands of people in the mall installing what they want on a phone that probably hasn&#8217;t been rebooted in 2 months.</p>
<p>This &#8220;terribly underpowered&#8221; Galaxy Nexus still has better spec than the other platforms&#8217; offerings.</p>
<p>I do only wonder how the project butter-Ui will feel like, presumably not that much of a difference.</p>
<p>Nice update, although I really don&#8217;t like the dark theming.  It looks like the UI is designed for pimple covered teenage boys.  Fortunately, that&#8217;s an easy fix. ;-)</p>
<p>$350 GN with 4.1 is tempting.  I hope that delivery and price model continues with future Nexus phones.  And, I would be quite happy if the rumored upcoming Nexus cohort contains a 4 inch version.  The faux tablet and compensating for something users can have all the mega sized phones they want.  I want a phone that works as a portable phone, for my needs.  And I want a phone that actually gets updates, hence a Nexus.</p>
<p>Project Butter is all good, but I&#8217;m really disappointed that Google didn&#8217;t come out with a unified messaging platform for messaging, talk and voice.</p>
<p>Umm&#8230; Gtalk?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, I meant the unification of google talk, the g+ messaging app, and google voice. The ability to use one app/portal for all messaging, with delivery receipts, and defaulting to texting when necessary, would be really cool.  I think that would make it a whole lot more uniform experience, but that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>i&#8217;d enjoy that</p>
<p>Ahhhh darn it !!! I just got a galaxy s3&#8230; Awesome hardware&#8230; but&#8230; I WANT JELLY BEAN !!!  :(</p>
<p>hopefully it wont be too long before the GS!!! receives the update, it could really do with some of those new features.. the new google+ and youtube apps are great, I WANT JELLY BEAN</p>
<p>damn i meant GSIII</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; TouchWiz with ICS is still bad&#8230; can&#8217;t drag icons on top of one another to create folders&#8230; home screen looks bad&#8230; easily fixed with a custom launcher but still.. I really hope vendors don&#8217;t change the stock UI in the future.  If they want to add value , they should provide extra back end stuff like the really cool power saving mode in the GS3 or 50GB of dropbox etc&#8230;.  Please DON&#8217;T MESS WITH THE UI &#8230; and they can bring out updates faster !!!</p>
<p>With all that location based data, are Google Now and the new Siri-like search features US only? That would really suck&#8230;.</p>
<p>I wonder if releasing Android 4.1 this time around &#8220;hints&#8221; no more official Nexus phones to introduce every new upgrade? Is this why they&#8217;re going to release &#8220;multiple&#8221; Nexus phones from several manufacturers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m confused, I can&#8217;t seem to co-relate. If the next line of Nexus phone(s) ship with Android 4.2, wouldn&#8217;t that be too fast of a pace for OS updates? Or are they moving the release schedule to June of every year?</p>
<p>I know that upgrading ICS to JellyBean will be a LOT easier than upgrading Gingerbread to ICS&#8230; But this is just too fast&#8230;</p>
<p>Google Now was really uncalled for. It only adds complexity to the OS and duplicates features of Maps, weather widget, search  etc. There are dedicated Apps for all these things. I really don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>And it runs in the background, using data and battery.</p>
<p>I just really hate aggregator apps. They do a lot of things badly/superficially. You&#8217;ll bump against its limits very fast.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to use it&#8230; plus it&#8217;s a gesture away, so instead of searching for each individual app you can access relevant information quickly. Let&#8217;s wait and try it before we dismiss its functionality.</p>
<p>So, does this mean the GNex is the best android device all over again?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Selling my iPad and Lumia 800 and replacing them with a Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 seems a compelling option :p Really hope these features make it across the pond for when I go to uni :)</p>
<p>I look forward to getting this on my GSII&#8230;oh wait I&#8217;ll probably have gone through 2 new phones by the time Sprint pushes this to me</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus &#8211;  The phone that Google software engineers use.  Look at all the Google IO presentation images, examples.  They&#8217;re all of the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best phone in the world.  Sure some have faster processors, but the Galaxy Nexus is not slow, especially with custom Kernals installed.  No phone has a better operating system than a Nexus.</p>
<p>Look at the picture at the top of this page.  It&#8217;s a Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>personally id use iOS or Win Phone 7/8 before android but whatever&#8230;.. if you love android then good for you.</p>

<p>Google Now is exactly what I have always wanted the smartphone to be. I&#8217;ve been thinking for some time now it would be great if it had some actual &#8220;smart&#8221; to go along with the oodles of general purpose computing. I figure Siri was the first step towards that, but it wasn&#8217;t proactive, you had to choose to interact with it. This is what I want, this is where the game is going. We have apps to do just about everything, and everyone has a really solid platform. Now it gets intelligent</p>
<p>Everyone with GSM Galaxy Nexus, get your Jelly Bean here: <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1737849" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1737849</a></p>
<p>Using it now, and it feels like a DREAM! Its as if a supercar got nitro-supercharged! Its like a new phone again! I&#8217;m loving everything about JB so far!</p>
<p>not really sure what you would call the style that this google now video used, but i&#8217;m really starting to get sick of it. Which apparently Google is really into, and now come to think of it I&#8217;m not really super into the Nexus Q &#8220;lets talk about how much we ourselves love out product&#8221; style either. The surface video was kind similar as well. Actually they are pretty much exactly the same in a lot of ways.</p>
<p><img src="http://s1-04.twitpicproxy.com/photos/large/606992517.png?key=7201280" /></p>
<p>Have it running on my Galaxy Nexus and it&#8217;s GREAT!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably root it on my HTC Sensation and have a clean Android for once.</p>
<p>&#8220;from Jelly Bean onwards, paid apps will be delivered with a device-specific key&#8221; <br />
Oh damn, there goes half my apps.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;ll get the Jellybean update for the Verizon GN by, what, 2037?</p>
<p>why wait?</p>

<p>And the Gallery is a but messed up.</p>
<p>The UI is so ugly.</p>
<p>trololol</p>
<p>Opiniononon</p>
<p>what&#8217;s a pretty UI to you then?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say I have a pretty UI choice but I like Window&#8217;s 8 UI &amp; iOS&#8217; UI is clean, simple &amp; straightforward. I dislike the Android UI, particularly on this tablet &amp; even on my Galaxy Nexus. It&#8217;s still very clunky to me. I want better &amp; something beautiful from Google. This ain&#8217;t it to me.</p>
<p>understandable. i can&#8217;t stand iOS.</p>
<p>so far, i&#8217;d have to say windows 8&#8217;s metro ui looks the most compelling. at least android 4.x looks far better than 2.x and 3.&#215;.</p>
<p>I like the Metro UI because it&#8217;s different, it&#8217;s rather unique. Whilst the Android UI seems like a rebellious younger brother to iOS. Android has indeed improved, but it really hasn&#8217;t made a mark of it&#8217;s own in terms of it&#8217;s UI, for me. I long for something more beautiful &amp; original, I don&#8217;t care who designs it.</p>
<p>Grid 10&#8217;s UI is unique. But it&#8217;s not pretty. <br />
You like the Metro UI because of it&#8217;s being Metro, because it&#8217;s beautiful, it just happens to be different.</p>
<p>I understand it&#8217;s just an opinion, and I try to respect them.  But you must be on crack, metro is blocky and plain.  Yes it gets the job done (if you don&#8217;t want much), but you get what you get and that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Metro is not just the home screen though, check out the pocket now comparison of the actual apps.</p>
<p>While I like Metro quite a bit, I think that Android 4.0 is fantastic, and 4.1 looks even better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how one could call it ugly.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re at it, it&#8217;s arguable that Android has surpassed iOS in terms of aesthetic design&#8230;</p>
<p>VERY arguable! It&#8217;s pure taste &amp; that&#8217;s just mine.</p>
<p>What I find ironic about your statement is that the &#8220;UI&#8221; of iOS is hardly original nor is it beautiful. The grid of icons will always find its origins with Xerox. Then when you talk about colorful icons with a consistent background, you have Palm&#8217;s PDA iconography. The beauty of iOS is in its simplicity because it defaulted to the lowest common denominator in only being a grid of icons. Apple&#8217;s imposed restrictions also don&#8217;t allow you to put icons wherever you want or in a disarrayed fashion, so there is an &#8220;order&#8221;. It satisfies the OCD in all of us. Beautiful is subjective; original it proves not.</p>
<p>Metro UI is very much like iOS in that there a physical restrictions on the UI elements. You have forms of rectangles and they&#8217;re limited to where they can be placed. I would argue (and have voiced previously) that the new changes to the UI that allows users to change the size of the Live Tiles has introduce some disorder to what was otherwise a clean aesthetic. Clutter is a distinct possibility now with Metro.</p>
<p>Android&#8217;s UI was never meant to be constrained by these aesthetic rules which most people gauge beautiful, but I would argue that Android&#8217;s UI is the most original. You need only take a look through the Verge Forums, at the entry entitled &#8220;Post Your Homescreens.&#8221; The exercise of a user&#8217;s individual aesthetic has produced a number of original creations. How you access apps, controls, functions are all different. You can make Android to emulate Windows Phone. You can throw a grid of apps on the homescreen. Or you can mix and match apps with widgets. Beauty is there fore in the eye of the beholder. Originality is their expression.</p>
<p>All the other elements of the UI are pretty much similar. How you access menus, toggle, etc. are pretty standard. What you think about the faux-realism aesthetic (fake brushed aluminum, linen, leather bindings, etc.) is a personal take. We know many are not fans. I&#8217;ve read vegans who absolutely abhor that their iDevice simulates leather.  But all that is also part of the UI.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, choose what you think is right for you. If you hate the UI so much on the GNex, sell it. Sounds like you&#8217;re an iOS guy anyways. It&#8217;ll relieve a lot of the stress you&#8217;re feeling when you interact with your device. No one should have to use a device that brings them so much disdain.</p>
<p>IOS UI looks like it is from 2002. it&#8217;s been left in the dust by windows and ICS. Now the cards being added to google like in chrome and google now is making it even more attractive.</p>

<p>See what i mean? JB looks fresh and evolves, IOS is stagnant and archaic.</p>
<p>iOS is clear to the point and easy to read. It&#8217;s a much better UI.</p>
<p>No, I don&#8217;t see what you mean. What is &#8220;stagnant and archaic&#8221; about it? All you did was post a picture. Except we already know what iOS looks like.</p>
<p>They call it stagnant and archaic because Apple didnt have to change the UI simply because theyve got it right the first time. Not unlike Android that they had to make heavy revamps all the time. Remember how the ugly the first UI was?</p>
<p>I agree with Ralph. Good UI isn&#8217;t just pretty, it gives you what you need in a clear, concise way. I think your pictures only show that the iphone has a better UI. In the JB pictures, you have a very tiny and hard to read map, and unnecessary background pictures that distract the eyes. The iOS picture is clean, simple, and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Yeah you guys are right about the UI needing to be clear, IOS does that very well. I still stand by my opinion that IOS looks old and ugly, which is entirely contradictory to it&#8217;s hardware.</p>
<p>Oh, you&#8217;re one of those people that wants everything to change all the time, for no other reason that &#8216;just because&#8217;. So glad people like you are in the minority</p>
<p>And you seem to be one of those annoying people who think any change however minute is incredibly bad.</p>
<p>Nice try putting words in my mouth. Change is great when it has a useful purpose. What you people are found shouting from the rooftops is a visual makeover not for any functional purpose, but without any justification given whatsoever.</p>
<p>But the IOS menu page is completely useless and any  design change to make it use the screen more effectively is a pro.</p>
<p>You tell notrelevant that he&#8217;s one of those people that puts words in your mouth but you did the same to me one post before. Calling me one of those people who want design changes just so it looks different, even though the design change from 2.2 &#8211; 4.0 made android that much cleaner and more efficient.</p>
<p>What do you mean by the menu page? All you said was it looks &#8216;outdated&#8217;. What functionality are you proposing?</p>
<p>Mainly something that with information that updates so you can get information without having to enter and exit apps.</p>
<p>So like live tiles and widgets.</p>
<p>That came in  iOS 5, and it&#8217;s called notification center. All relevant incoming information goes there</p>
<p>everything changes so how is it that he&#8217;s in the minority?</p>
<p>why would anyone want to buy anything new if it looked and functioned exactly like its predecessor?</p>
<p>Pointless to talk in absolutes about design. It&#8217;s a personal preference. In the example you have here I think iOS looks much nicer.  In my opinion the Android UI has always suffered from clutter and lack of focus. If I&#8217;m asking about my meetings what the hell does baseball have to do with it for example?</p>
<p>I think everyone forgets that it was everyone else catching up to IOS. So when the UI does change it will be very very drastic.</p>
<blockquote>If I’m asking about my meetings what the hell does baseball have to do with it for example?</blockquote>
<p>You assume that it&#8217;s a response to a question. Probably because you didn&#8217;t actually watch the keynote.<br />
It&#8217;s not a response to a question, that is a start screen of Google Now. It&#8217;s more in the direction of relevant information display, something like Microsoft(and everyone else) mostly failed with &#8220;glanceable information&#8221;.</p>
<p>Um actually i don&#8217;t see what you mean at all. Like what so ever lol.</p>
<p>In your example, I much prefer the iPhone!  I am glad there are peeps out there that are far different than me however =]~</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>Agreed, IOS looks the same since 07. It works fine but is limited and bores me to death.</p>
<p>If a phone is entertaining you that much you might want to take a deep breath and ask your self. Has my life really come to this? I don&#8217;t understand. A smart phone should be straight forward, to the point, and get the job done. That&#8217;s exactly what IOS does. The vast majority of android users don&#8217;t even know what version of the OS they are using let alone care.</p>
<blockquote>If a phone is entertaining you that much you might want to take a deep breath and ask your self. Has my life really come to this? </blockquote>
<p>lol</p>
<p>&#8230;and you honestly think that same majority of iPhone users know what version of iOS they&#8217;re running? Much less care?</p>
<p>If anything iPhone users are much LESS tech savy than Android folk are&#8230;.</p>
<p>That can be taken as an insult, based on your opinion, which is probably based on some people who didn&#8217;t know what version of iOS they&#8217;re using, which is the same for almost anything that has a &#8220;version.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being &#8220;tech savvy&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean you need to know which version of software you&#8217;re using, and knowing your version (some numbers strung together to make the speaker feel superior in some way) doesn&#8217;t make you tech &#8220;savvy,&#8221; it just makes you a person who knows what set of numbers your OS represents.</p>
<p>Someone who is tech &#8220;savvy&#8221; should be able to use tech and make his/her life simpler, more convenient. Regardless of the ever so important OS version.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re making it sound like people using Android know a LOT about tech. Sales show that they both sell pretty well. They can&#8217;t ALL be stupid on one side and &#8220;tech savvy&#8221; on the other.</p>
<p>Sweeping generalizations spoken like a true sweeping generalizer.</p>
<p>how about this example then: i have many friends who use iphones and they all ask me how to do this or that even though i&#8217;m an android user.</p>
<p>for some reason, android is more intuitive to me while iOS feels backwards. mostly, navigating menus is a chore in iOS to me.</p>
<p>Feeling intuitive to you is a personal opinion, and voicing that particular thught is totally within reason, but calling a group of people who chose a specific product either savvy or not is just wrong.</p>
<p>it is in my experience that iOS users know less about their devices and tech in general than android users. it&#8217;s a small sample size but that&#8217;s what i&#8217;ve noticed.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not unlike people who drive accords and camrys knowing less about their cars than wrx and evo owners.</p>
<p>I understand your point on the automobile selection, and why you would think so, but I disagree, especially on the OS front.<br />
Reason being : If we start with the car comparison, and all the cars in question were  automatic transmission, driving one car doesn&#8217;t make it so drastically different from a different model. Pretty similar. It gets you from point A to B, regardless of how fun or challenging it might be. <br />
Then the difference of demographic comes down to taste and budget. <br />
However, if the comparison was focused on driving stick vs auto, then there would be a strong trend of difference. Now taking that idea to the choice of phone OS, Android and iOS both try to make the user experience smooth. (Whether they succeed or not is up to the manufacturer, but the point remains the same: &#8220;using a smartphone to simplify and mobilize the digital life.&#8221;) <br />
It&#8217;s not like with Android, rooting is obligatory, and with iOS, jailbreaking is impossible. Most of the people using smartphones probably use the stock interface. Whether it&#8217;s iOS or Android.</p>
<p>Of course, everybody has their own sample group to base these assumptions on, but it&#8217;s still just a personal assumption.</p>
<p>My point is that categorizing people into groups and calling them less &#8220;savvy&#8221; in some aspect is an insult to the rest of the group. That is all.</p>
<p>the same can be said of iOS users&#8230;</p>
<p>in general, Android users are more tech saavy than iOS users.</p>
<p>Why does it matter if it looks the same? As long as they keep updating it with more functionality, isn&#8217;t that what really matters?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve actually found Android to be increasingly sexy lately. Looking at the new Jelly Bean shots and the customizations people have in the home screen thread, I really can&#8217;t help but wonder why anyone prefers WP.</p>
<p>I understand that a lot of people don&#8217;t like the skeumorphisms that exist in iOS or just how locked down it is in terms of customizability. I <em>get</em> that. WP doesn&#8217;t offer any customizability over iOS though. You can&#8217;t even have a wallpaper. You&#8217;re stuck with app <blockquote>icons</blockquote> tiles with solid colors, cut corners, and large text buttons. I guess it&#8217;s a matter of taste, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned metro is just the most boring thing to look at.</p>
<p>Windows 8 UI is a useless square crap. If that is a pretty UI to you, there&#8217;s nothing to talk about at all.</p>
<p>useless? doubt it.<br />
square crap? opinion.</p>
<p>i doubt you have much to talk about at all anyways.</p>
<p>iOS&#8217;s UI is tacky, plasticky and incredibly dated, drenched in glossy glass buttons and ugly textures. It&#8217;s genuinely hideous. The minimalism of Android 4.x is very attractive and its biggest weakness is simply the number of third party widgets that don&#8217;t mesh with it. The Windows Metro thing is pretty but maybe taking that a bit too far in how rigid it is.</p>
<p>The trend of calling people who have different opinions &#8220;trolls&#8221; is really annoying</p>
<p>Agreed. We should, however, find an alternate word to describe those who just write four words to state their opinion as if it was a fact, and give absolutely no argument whatsoever to support it. Because that&#8217;s annoying as hell too.</p>
<p>Why does the homescreen have to look like such a garbled mess. FFS someone please kill widgets already. They&#8217;re so clunky.</p>
<p>guess what? you have the option of not adding widgets to your homescreen!</p>
<p>Get outta here with that silly &#8220;logic&#8221; stuff!</p>
<p>You got 2 options: You can accept the facts or you can close your eyes and live in the fairy world. Is that simple</p>
<p>Shh&#8230; Don&#8217;t tell the Apple fanboi that there are &#8220;options&#8221;, it will be too big of a revelation to him.</p>
<p>But you have to add apps to your homescreen if you want to organise them,  which is annoying.</p>
<p>Do you know what you just said? the new Android UI is heavily inspired by Metro UI. Thus if you say Android looks ugly, you also say Metro UI looks ugly which is bogus. This is the future. It&#8217;s clean, it&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s finally smooth.</p>
<p>Guess that makes Android an ugly knock off?</p>
<p>I thought Jelly Bean looked impressive from the Keynote, but you really have to use it. It is considerably smoother, and adds all sorts of cool animations. The stock apps are updated in cool ways and everything just feels much cleaner and faster. It honestly feels alot like the upgrade to 4.0</p>
<p>If you have ANY kind of Gnexus i highly recommend flashing one of the builds floating around I believe all of them are supported (Vicious has one out for the Verizon one already with no bugs).</p>
<p>I thought it would have a few new feaures that were cool and the performance wouldn&#8217;t be noticeably. It DEFINITELY is. It is easily as smooth as iOS now, maybe smoother.</p>
<p>FWIW, the impression given on this very article said it still isn&#8217;t as smooth as a recent iPad.</p>
<p>Well, his opinion seems based on first hand experience with 4.1, while yours is &#8220;what some guy at a website wrote about it&#8221;.</p>
<p>If topsnus did use 4.1 and found it smoother than iOS, it is unlikely that you will convince him otherwise just because someone at The Verge doesn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>No, he said it isn&#8217;t as fast. Not the same thing. The animations may be longer/slower but still animate at a higher framerate.</p>
<p>Woah something wrong happened here.</p>
<p>this post is worthless without VIDEO</p>
<p>They FTFY.</p>
<p>Pardon the ignorance, but what&#8217;s FTFY?</p>

<p>Must be an unclosed tag or a copy and paste error somewhere. WEB DEVELOPERS TO THE RESCUE!</p>
<p>Looking at these screenshots and having used S3 flavour of ICS for some time i understand that i don&#8217;t really like stock Android&#8230;it&#8217;s nowhere as pretty, functional or intuitive as the Touchwiz variant&#8230;in my opinion.</p>
<p>still excited about the notifications and homescreen management additions. knowing samsung, though, i&#8217;m probably gonna get JB somewhere around 2015</p>
<p>The pics of it running in an emulator don&#8217;t do it justice compared to the demo we saw at I/O</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus comes out in December. ICS for S2 comes out in March. Of course, carriers got to delay it until June. But if Samsung&#8217;s clout with the S3 is a sign, the S3 will probably get JB around the same time as the Verizon Nexus: Q3-Q4 2012.</p>
<p>really hope so. Where i live carries don&#8217;t interfere, luckily :)</p>
<p>Well once JB is released for the GSM Galaxy Nexus in July, the devs will grab that and simply adapt it to the CDMA model. The only thing that separates the two are the Radio drivers and you can keep the Radio drivers from ICS and still get all the JB goodness. I could be wrong though.</p>
<p>For those of us that care about what version of Android our phones are running just install your own, it&#8217;s very empowering. In a perfect world we shouldn&#8217;t have to do this, but Verizon and AT&amp;T are an Oligopoly and that means they can do what ever they feel like.</p>
<p>Always preferred HTC Sense to Touchwiz.  I moved away from that to the stock ICS look of CyanogenMod.  Never looked back.  But I can&#8217;t help but feel I must be colour-blind, as I look at TouchWiz and always feel like the designer has smeared shit on the screen.   :-\</p>
<p>my only experience with Sense is on my friend&#8217;s One X. Yeah, let&#8217;s just say i&#8217;m not a fan. Not of the design, not of the (lack of) useful additions</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard lots of good things about the One X, and the Sense 4.0 is definitely a step up from their Gingerbread version.  But, each unto their own!</p>
<p>Sense 4.0 is alright&#8230; but my CM9 alpha rom is much better.  A little bit more development and it will be perfect.  Stock ICS is really good its definitely time for manufacturers to make launchers the come default and can be easily turned off.</p>
<p>What device are you running CM9 on?</p>
<p>The new Samsung skin looks much cleaner than Sense 4.0</p>
<p>You might find it interesting to note that the main developer behind CyanogenMod now works for Samsung on Touchwiz.  Touchwiz on the S3 is definitely closer to stock with useful additions.</p>
<p><em>de gustibus non est disputandum</em></p>
<p>I prefer prompt updates and choosing my own apps.</p>
<p>This, too!</p>
<p>well the S3 only came with the S Planner and S Note preinstalled, no more bloatware :)</p>
<p>I agree. It really is up to a person&#8217;s preference in a device.</p>
<p>I like the look of ICS but having been accustomed to TW on my Note, It&#8217;s pretty easy on the eyes&#8230; untuitivity-wise haha!</p>
<p>Looking at these screenshots? Please do not comment before using stock ICS for a few days.</p>
<p>funny&#8230; i for one cant stand the cartoony touch wiz. though i can stand the new touch wiz from the s3.. i still prefer vanilla android.. then maybe sense 4.0.</p>
<p>extra touch wiz features like the toggles on the notification tray can be added through third party apps.</p>
<p>to each his own i guess. lovely that we get to choose which flavor of android to consume. good thing i really prefer the stock experience so i have a galaxy nexus and a nexus one before that. first one to get jelly bean! :D</p>
<p>thats one big problem with samsung. they take forever to update. with all the extras they crammed on the s3 version of ICS it could take forever for them to update to jelly bean.</p>
<p>well, that&#8217;s your opinion&#8230; but my opinion is: AAAAAAAAAAre you kidding me??</p>
<p>Stock Android is much better than any other grid based UI out there. In my opinion, the current android is just a grid based verision of Windows Phone. They share a very similar design language.  Clear, sharp and FRESH.</p>
<p>Touchwiz is pretty much a iOS ripoff. Well, those iOS elements got trimmed down quite a bit in S3, but still&#8230;. the color, the style and some details don&#8217;t really fit into holo design.</p>
<p>On the other hand, well, I don&#8217;t have too many problems with iOS UI beside the limitations and its outdated look&#8230;&#8230;. Seriously,  it&#8217;s not a better UI but just works for those who don&#8217;t do much customization or simply just want a phone works most time&#8230;.</p>
<p>I, as a causal graphic designer&#8230;.. hate iOS ui&#8230;. happy with Metro and want stock androic on every android device!!!!</p>
<p>Guess what, every UI ever arranges things in grids. iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Symbian, Maemo, Bada, WebOS. If I hear one more person throw the &#8216;grid&#8217; term around I&#8217;ll find some way to punch them in the face.</p>
<p>I agree. It&#8217;s completely bare. But some people like it that way. And the endless customization options are there to suit your needs.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re confused there. Touchwiz is the ugliest bit crap you can get on android.</p>
<p>For just a .1 update it seems to be packing alot</p>
<p>Definitely more new features here than a couple of iOS major updates.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a joke, right?</p>
<p>Well with iOS you atleast know that you will get the update when they ship it.</p>
<p>You will too if you get a Nexus device.</p>
<p>and with all the apps supported</p>
<p>Except for Google Wallet on the Verizon Galaxy Nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t come with the phone, but you can definitely install it. I&#8217;m running stock on my Vz Gnex and have it installed from the Play Store.</p>
<p>But the average consumer doesn&#8217;t know that. They&#8217;ll buy for example a GS3 and wonder why their friends G Nexus is running a newer version of android than theirs.</p>
<p>To be honest, the average consumer probably doesn&#8217;t wonder what version their Android device is running.</p>
<p>You mean &quot; update&quot; as it is really has been the same forever.</p>
<p>Compared to what Android was 4 years ago, they did need a lot of work.</p>
<p>The counter to that would be that there&#8217;s less to work on, when you are already ahead, &#8220;and still didn&#8217;t keep up with our swiping fingers as quickly as they do on a recent iPad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trolls gonna troll&#8230;</p>
<p>that&#8217;s what she said!</p>
<p>And not really, when you look at what ICS already can do. Compared to pre-ICS, yes it&#8217;s a big leap forward. At least they didn&#8217;t show off Face Unlock!</p>
<p>Yes but that&#8217;s understood because for phones it was a jump from 2.3 to 4.0</p>
<p>I said that. then you said the same thing. so what&#8217;s your point?</p>
<p>After updating to 4.0.4, I must say face unlock is very much improved. I started to use it as default and have been using it ever since. If you&#8217;ve updated, give it another shot.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t go by version numbers on Android. Each named update is a major update. And named updates haven&#8217;t necessarily come with full version numbers.</p>
<p>Yes, a (space) lot.</p>
<p>What does the .1 have to do with it?  It really just says that incrementing by a &#8220;dot&#8221; or a whole number does not have a consistent meaning in terms of the number of features added.</p>
<p>Can you try out the new notifications stuff? Long press on a notification to see which app created it and be able to block notifications per app.</p>
<p>For example being NOTIFIED whenever the temperature changes? heheheheheh</p>
<p>Just watched the dev section on the notification improvements and it looks like a pretty awesome addition to me. Will massively help to get things done quickly without interfering with whatever else you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Google Now looks really interesting but will need some personal hands on time with it to judge whether or not it&#8217;s useful.</p>
<p>So in 2020 when you&#8217;re actually developing for this thing, you&#8217;ll be all set. Till then, it&#8217;s Gingerbread Gingerbread Gingerbread..</p>
<p>The average life of a phone is around 2 years tops. Even low end phones are now coming out with 4.0.3 and 4.0.4.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re wrong. As usual.</p>
<p>no feedum troll</p>
<p>Landscape mode?</p>
<p>No rear cam?  My HP TouchPad sympathises!</p>
<p>Never used mine on my iPad after the day I got it. Where do you miss a camera?</p>
<p>Some people have different use cases for their tablet. Some may use it to scan documents or take quick work-related snapshots.</p>
<p>For example, I will occasionally take a snapshot of a document with my iPad at work  and upload it to Evernote.</p>
<p>I can literally count the number of times I&#8217;ve done this on one hand, though, so I understand why Google and Asus didn&#8217;t mind saving a few bucks to leave it off the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Well I use the back camera a lot.<br />
During video calls I often need to show the person I&#8217;m talk to, something in front of me, and therefore shift back and forth between the front and back cameras.</p>
<p>So, back cameras are very important for video conversations, just like front facing cameras. I&#8217;m surprised no-one realized that</p>
<p>How about just turning the device around? Isn&#8217;t that hard to do, do it isn&#8217;t That important.</p>
<p>Of course if you do that, the &#8220;view-finder&#8221; is going to be on the wrong side.</p>
<p>I see a very valid point about the missing back camera. If I were going to put a camera on a tablet device, I believe I would use a low resolution camera such as the front facing camera. However, given that this tablet is indeed smaller than other ~10 inch tablets, it almost wouldn&#8217;t seem that ridiculous using it to take photos.</p>
<p>&#8230; except you can&#8217;t see where you&#8217;re pointing it. Have you ever tried to do this with a laptop? It&#8217;s impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the Nexus 7, however, it was a little hard to tell without having an Ice Cream Sandwich device side by side, and still didn&#8217;t keep up with our swiping fingers as quickly as they do on a recent iPad. &quot;</p>
<p>lmao it&#8217;s still laggy.</p>
<p>It may not be lag, but a scroll speed setting (not something that is user configurable unless you hack).</p>
<p>whatever it is its going to look bad and make the user experience worse.</p>
<p>Everybody seems to think the user experience is so great on iOS and WP7 when in fact they are in many cases slow than Android and hide it through transitions.  These are things that people adapt to.  Flaky movement&#8230;less so.</p>
<p>Spot on.</p>
<p>Monkey boy doesn&#8217;t seem to get this. He trolls hard in this area.</p>
<p>hm yeah, im the one trolling when the verge and other outlets are reporting the nexus 7 still isn&#8217;t as smooth  as the iPad.</p>
<p>watch the videos. jeez. and it&#8217;s only the verge that has &#8220;reported&#8221; this.</p>
<p>just because they didn&#8217;t catch the lagginess on video doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t there. the guy wrote that he saw it. i&#8217;ve seen posts by people at i/o that got to play with it that also say it isn&#8217;t as smooth as an ipad.</p>
<p>Why even read reviews if you&#8217;re going to completely base your opinion off prepared videos shown during press events?</p>
<p>iPad is perfectly smooth only in the home screen swiping. It lags here and there; and scrolling isn&#8217;t all that buttery smooth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter of degrees.  Scrolling is buttery smooth in everything I can think of except complex rendered web pages in non-Safari UIWebViews (unless the private _setDrawInWebThread is enabled on it, which I want to slap Scott Forstall for not making a public API).</p>
<p>Scrolling through my music collection on my &#8220;new&#8221; iPad is like someone throwing sand into my eyes(but maybe that&#8217;s just me). Safari is smooth, though.</p>
<p>ahaha what? Well if the slowness of iO<br />
s and particularly Windows Phone are hidden by transitions maybe Matias and Co could learn a thing or two or three and implement them maybe? (Crap now Call me maybe is in my head). I will tell you bluntly that their UX&#8217;s are great (specially wp7s).</p>
<p>Everybody thinks the user experience is great on iOS and WP7 because it is great. People don&#8217;t care about why their ui looks smooth as long as it looks smooth. the jellybean ui apparently still doesn&#8217;t look smooth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re confusing speed with responsiveness. If I tap something and something happens (albeit a transitionary state) that <em>feels responsive</em>. Not doing anything then showing the result of my interaction instead gives the impression of laggy response.</p>
<p>This is the excuse I keep hearing but it makes no sense. When I scroll a web page on Android it takes a split second to respond then the page lags a few pixels behind my finger. On WP7 it begins to move a lot sooner (enough so that it&#8217;s imperceptible) and seems to scroll at a 1:1 rate. When I had my Galaxy Nexus I tested this by starting at the bottom of the page and moving my finger really slowly across the screen, it was obvious that the web page and my finger were moving at completely different rates; the page element that my finger was directly above when I started the scroll wasn&#8217;t the same as when I ended it. How exactly are iOS and WP7 employing trickery to hide this?</p>
<p>Or how about the keyboard, on my Galaxy Nexus it was still easy to get my keyboard to severely lag at will. On WP7 this is near impossible. How exactly is MS employing trickery to make it seem as if the keyboard is keeping up with my taps?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not seeing lag or anything slow about JB in the hands-on youtube videos I&#8217;ve been watching.</p>
<p>i suppose it&#8217;s laggy if you&#8217;re swiping your finger at an idiotically fast rate just to show that it&#8217;s laggy</p>
<p>Or I suppose it&#8217;s buttery smooth if you film the animations at an idiotically fast frame rate just to show that&#8217;s it&#8217;s buttery smooth.</p>
<p>Works both ways.</p>
<p>What? They show off usage from an actual device on stage&#8230; not a simulation. Goes one way..</p>
<p>Nice write up, but there is no such thing as a nice picture of David Cameron..</p>
<p>Wait, why are there Google Apps on an emulator?</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s Google&#8217;s emulator?</p>
<p>Because there is an emulator image that comes with google apps, and one that doesn&#8217;t</p>
<p>My mistake, Calendar isn&#8217;t a Google App.</p>
<p>why do you guys use the locked up tablet in the atrium when you all got one in a bag? should be way more convenient, no?</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have theirs yet.  The booth opens in the afternoon, according to Vic.</p>
<p>No one will get their tablets until 4PM PDT.</p>
<p>And mid-July for the rest of us!! AARRRGGHHHH!!</p>

<p>You&#8217;re using that wrong</p>
<p>I thought so, when I posted it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take 2-weeks wait over 6 months or not knowing exactly when any time of the day.</p>
<p>HTF (like wtf) do people produce results like this, &quot;and still didn&#8217;t keep up with our swiping fingers as quickly as they do on a recent iPad. &quot;  I have an OG Evo 4g that keeps up with my swiping fingers as fast as I can possibly swipe them.  I feel no lag when compared to my new iPad.</p>
<p>Actually, I do get a lag on my new iPad when I accidentally swipe all the way over to the search space&#8230;it hiccups for a second as it brings up the search UI.</p>
<p>you could see a certain lag during the keynote as well.. it&#8217;s too bad! but i&#8217;m sure it will be discussed more in depth in the upcoming review! :)</p>
<p>All previous high-end Android reviews i&#8217;ve seen have all said there&#8217;s no lag and it&#8217;s buttery smooth. So, either they&#8217;re lying, or this new level of non existent lag is unnoticeable unless you film it at very high speeds to capture it.</p>
<p>to be clear i&#8217;m an android fanboy and i own a GSII with Cyanogenmod 9&#8230; but there is something about iOS touch input that is 1:1 ratio with interaction, i really hope that project butter gets to that eventually. i guess it&#8217;s not there yet &#8230; &quot;and still didn’t keep up with our swiping fingers as quickly as they do on a recent iPad. &quot;</p>
<p>to sum up .. I AM DISAPOINT :(</p>
<p>Really? Bring up the music app on a new iPad and try scrolling fast through a large collection, it&#8217;s really hard on my eyes every time.</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t see lag in an unoptimized ported sdk version of JB on my nexus&#8230;then surely someone is making something up when it comes to lag.</p>
<p>Who knew Sean Hollister had a such a profesional announcer voice?? Love it!!!</p>
<blockquote>still didn&#8217;t keep up with our swiping fingers as quickly as they do on a recent iPad.</blockquote>
<p>When will google fix input lag? Ugh&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the price of proper multitasking.</p>
<p>Well, according to them anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the price of a bad core design decision. iOS favors UI rendering above anything else. Android doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>When scrolling a webpage in iOS, the page stops loading until you stopped scrolling. in Android it keeps loading up, seemingly slowing down the device.</p>
<p>Hence, iOS looks smoother but loads more slowly. I prefer smooth looking over faster loading though.</p>
<p>I would think with a quad core device they could afford to give the UI a dedicated thread.</p>
<p>iOS does not stop the page loading while you are scrolling.  In any case, once the page loads iOS is still smoother.  And I don&#8217;t think iOS loads pages more slowly in any significant way.  Most comparisons of similar generation devices show similar page load speeds.  Add to that the fact that even a large fairly complex page  (say, theverge home page) only takes several seconds to load.  I usually don&#8217;t need to begin scrolling and reading like mad before it finishes. :)</p>
<p>THAT&#8217;S NOT INPUT LAG.</p>
<p>Watch the video. It&#8217;s more likely acceleration and deceleration. I noticed no dropped frames in the video.</p>
<p>Whatever you want to call it, the scrolling doesn&#8217;t keep up with the finger. It&#8217;s not nearly as close to 1:1 movement as in iOS.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well documented. Android users need to stop living in denial about it. Project Butter is more evidence that it&#8217;s a legitimate issue in the user experience.</p>
<p>Scrolling actually does move with your finger as long as the finger stays on screen. There is an elastic band effect, that is not lag. The thing is there by design. Now you might not like it, but it&#8217;s not technically lag.</p>
<p>Did I see a Final Fantasy App at the :30 mark?</p>
<p>I saw it too&#8230;<br />
WTF google?? why u no announce it??</p>
<p>Does any one know when the next Nexus phones will be announced?</p>
<p>Tomorrow.</p>
<p>Fall, and has always been Fall.</p>
<p>Has anyone asked anything about dock availability?</p>
<p>It looks just as shitty as every other non-Apple tablet. That&#8217;s not to say I have or want an Apple tablet. I actually don&#8217;t care for the 10&quot; form factor. But nobody else seems to be able to make anything that doesn&#8217;t suck. So I&#8217;ll go without entirely.</p>
<p>what makes it look shitty? what are you expecting out of a $200 tablet? or how about any non-iPad tablet?</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t I click on the replies in my user profile any more? It was working at the start of the week, now they&#8217;re not showing as a link in IE or Firefox.</p>

<p>banana.gif</p>
<p>Mind is not blown. That &#8220;Google Now&#8221; feature is super hidden and super pointless. There are a lot of dedicated Apps for any interest out there. Such aggregator apps will always be lacking if they don&#8217;t offer an API. If they do, the complexity of managing them goes way up. It&#8217;s why I hate Flipboard  (Basic integrated services suck,  but managing it to my preference sucks even more).  Googles just want  to shove ads down our throat.</p>
<p>The Music and Video Apps look really bad and are still US only. Not cool.</p>
<p>I like the notification and Home screen  additions though.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was no need to release this now. Just more rage from all the users who just got ICS.  Poor OEMs just got screwed:)</p>
<blockquote>Googles just want to shove ads down our throat.</blockquote>
<p>duh. how do you think they make their revenue?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty Funny that Google Now uses a gesture that seems to suggest its&#8217; the &#8216;Siri&#8217; clone&#8230; then you open it up, and it&#8217;s&#8230; iGoogle.com ( I mean the aggregator web page Google has had for years but no one uses). Nice. It looks like Yahoo did back in the 90&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a portal with a bunch of stuff it thinks I care about, fed with GPS data.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t see an ad in any card in Google Now. Could you point one or for all of us?</p>
<p>I am confused. The phone pictures have the old stock browser, but the Nexus 7 pics have Chrome. If both are Running JB why don&#8217;t they both have Chrome?</p>
<p>Was that Final Fantasy (00:30)? I know that Final Fantasy is released on Android in Japan but is it als available in the US?</p>
<p>probably a FF soundtrack album</p>
<p>if it is just the music, it will show as &#8220;google play music&#8221; right? This has the app title as final fantasy</p>
<p>Looks great but the simplest feature they still haven&#8217;t added: battery percentage in the notification bar.</p>
<p>Google now and the new notification changes already beat out what IOS6 brings and this is just a &#8220;.1&#8221; update. Haha great job Apple.</p>
<p>2 things, firstly, iOS 6 isn&#8217;t out yet, and Apple always holds back a few surprises, secondly, a .1 update on Android isn&#8217;t the same as a .1 update on iOS. By that logic, ICS should have been a tremendous disappointment and JB is jus catching up, because ICS was a jump from 2.3 for phones.</p>
<p>Well, you can download the iOS6 dev preview already&#8230; I don&#8217;t think there will be a major update or improvement beside screen resolution bump in iOS 6. Apple doesn&#8217;t have too much to hide except a new phone I suppose.</p>
<p>From those leaks of next gen iPhone and current apple strategy, I am not expecting something really impressive is gonna happen. <br />
a 4&#8217; screen<br />
b 1gb ram<br />
c a bit thinner design<br />
d bigger battery<br />
e iOS 6</p>
<p>are the best the new Phone could get.</p>
<p>I cannot figure out your second point by the way&#8230;.. How comes ICS jumping from 2.3 to 4.04 is a tremendous disappointment??? JB is really an enhanced version&#8230; But there&#8217;s no real catching up on the Google&#8217;s side (except Siri vs Knowledge Graph Search).</p>
<p>Apple is actual the one who is trying to catch up.</p>
<p>There is nothing for them to catch up on though. Widgets are not Any more useful than notification center for more users, side loading apps hasn&#8217;t proven to be the end all to app quality, and however much Android proponents scream &#8216;choice&#8217; at the top of their lungs, there isn&#8217;t really any, all the different tiers are basically using the same conponents. Do you want a high end phone with a not giant screen? Too bad, this is how OEMs win their pissing contests. There may be high, mid, and low choices, but there is no mix and match model.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things Apple can toss in ios between now and October, but even if they don&#8217;t, there is nothing in JB that somehow makes ios obsolete or even archaic. It&#8217;s a different approach, iOS will be ahead in some ways, Android in others. Depends on what you value, and what you need.</p>
<p>This post is a joke right?  Choice is what separates Android from everything else!</p>
<p>Want a quad core cpu?  Covered.  Dual core?  Check<br />
Want an HD amoled screen?  Check.  HD LCD screen?  Check<br />
1gb memory vs 2gb?  check<br />
expandable memory vs non-expandable? Check<br />
Single, dual, quad, or 12 core gpu?  Check</p>
<p>Please tell me more about how all of the tiers of android phones are using the same components.<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t know a snapdragon, from a hummingbird, or a exynos from a tegra.</p>
<p>That choice isn&#8217;t yours though, it&#8217;s the OEMs&#8217; and carriers&#8217;. You can&#8217;t choose a galaxy s3 with a 4.3 inch screen. You can&#8217;t get a OneX, or a gNex with an SD card slot. You cant get a Nexus on Verizon without a bit of bloatware and an absent Wallet app. You will give up any number of choices in order to get any other one. They all sure sold you with the hype though. The next version of Android really should be called Kool-aid. Keep drinking it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take an iPhone with an SD card slot.</p>
<p>Wait, whaddya mean they don&#8217;t make one?</p>
<p>How so? Most of these features were in iOS5 including the ability to manage notifications on a per app basis and action items for individual notifications. Didn&#8217;t see anything about lock-screen notifications in 4.1 but I may have missed it.  Didn&#8217;t see anything similar to the &#8216;do not disturb&#8217; feature of iOS6 either. Both systems are pretty good in my opinion. (I do wish Android would clear mail notifications when you&#8217;ve already read the message on another device like iOS does with IMAP accounts)</p>
<p>Android has been doing something similar to DND for ages. Since 2.2 I believe.</p>
<blockquote>I do wish Android would clear mail notifications when you’ve already read the message on another device like iOS does with IMAP accounts</blockquote>
<p>GMail does that. Not sure about the mail client though.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s a pretty boring update. Though, i think that&#8217;s a good thing. Because phones are just NOW getting ICS. The SIII will be available in the US and will come with ICS. I think if they made a drastic change it wouldn&#8217;t work. People don&#8217;t realize that in the beginning android was not keeping up with IOS, for years they actually where no where on the map. Even when they started to get noticed from HTC phones and Moto phones the UI was really really bad. They only caught up with IOS with ICS. Android will keep the ICS look for a while now that they finally have the OS the way that they want it. Just like IOS has stayed the same looks wise for these past years. Theres no reason to break something that already works. IOS will eventually have a new UI but theres a point where the technology has to slow down for the user. Take windows for example, even now no drastic changes have been made to it&#8217;s look. OSX another example, no drastic UI changes for years. Why? Because it&#8217;s just not necessary yet. We will keep seeing various tweeks and things added to all of these operating systems. But i can tell you right now that the general look and feel of android ICS and beyond will be the same for quite some time.</p>
<p>And when i say windows i mean the desktop version not windows 8. Windows 8 is the frist step in many many  many years decades in fact of a drastic change to the operating system.</p>
<p>There you go HTC and Samsung. That&#8217;s what you get for not listening and not including on-screen buttons, haha! What now? Access Google now by long pressing the menu button?</p>
<p>I made the mistake of starting to read the comments for this article. Trolls. All I wanted to say.</p>
<p>Those Google Now cards look like they took some &#8220;inspiration&#8221; from the Metro design language &#8211; the typography looks a lot like Segoe UI.</p>
<p>not really. More like webs cards</p>
<p>maybe one or two year latter, we will smile to our mobile and say politely : Mirror Mirror, please tell me&#8230;</p>
<p>People whine too much.</p>
<p>I look at this in a very simple way.  Theres 2  groups to discuss about here. People like us who are tech enthusiasts and &#8220;normal&#8221; people. And normal people outnumber us VASTLY. Most people don&#8217;t care about Jelly Bean or Metro and iOS. Most people just want a nice looking device that works. Part of the great success of Apple that no one talks about is all the press they get. You see their products here, on tv, on the radio in movies and theres a lot of word of mouth involved too. Little Johnny goes to Timmy&#8217;s house and sees his iPod then he goes to home and asks mommy and daddy for one. Normal people look at their products and say &#8220;pretty&#8221; ill take it. They have no idea it has iOS5 and all that crap. Android is really useful but to who? us? or the normal people. Its a big freakin mess, you have to dig everything out and it&#8217;s clear that Google lacks some good designers. I think Android&#8217;s success comes from it being free and all the saturation by the OEMs not because it&#8217;s highly customizable and open sourced. I cant really comment on WP because its not even a contender. But It is the most radically different than the other 2. Maybe a little too bland with the Metro UI but it gets to the point.</p>
<p>Not at all impressed. This is supposed to be a year&#8217;s worth of work. <br />
I cant help thinking oems are holding Google back</p>
<p>Another article on the Verge sais it was a total work of four months. I&#8217;m not impressed either, it is not that smooth. Now it can lag at 60 fps</p>
<p>I hope the Emulator is a little bit faster now and needs less ressources!</p>
<p>Google seems to be in mid air, right above the shark.</p>
<p>&#8230;And again Google, where is the native battery percentage on the notification area?? RLY?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite impressed. Might buy one of those tablets while I wait for the Surface.</p>
<p>Sean, swiping away from the multi-task list doesn&#8217;t clear anything from memory so you &#8220;can launch them fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>No words.</p>

<p>Might get the longest story-stream on the Verge. I will make a novel out of it.</p>

<p>#fuckapple</p>
<p>You posted that twice. I upvoted that twice</p>
<p>Wow. Apple may have more pressing matters on their hands&#8230; at 10:55 AM EST today, Apple stock officially passed the $564 barrier making it officially a BEAR stock (20% drop).</p>
<p><img src="http://s10.postimage.org/awxbzemx5/aapl_down8.png" /></p>
<p>Just. Look. At. The. Ticker.</p>
<p>Stock is collapsing.<br />
I just finished writing this post and it&#8217;s down another $1/share. Probably because they just got sued and lost (VirnetX).</p>
<p>Actually, just to clarify: The market may be reacting to the recent lawsuit against Apple by VirnetX patent violation in products like FaceTime ( <a href="http://wallstreetpit.com/97716-apple-aapl-hit-with-368m-in-damages-in-virnetx-patent-suit/" target="_blank">http://wallstreetpit.com/97716-apple-aapl-hit-with-368m-in-damages-in-virnetx-patent-suit/</a> ) and also the issue that on Monday, Apple&#8217;s lawsuit against Motorola was thrown out of court ( <a href="http://themarketsareopen.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/aapl-us-court-throws-out-apple-inc.html" target="_blank">http://themarketsareopen.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/aapl-us-court-throws-out-apple-inc.html</a> ) so there are some confidence shakers which may explain the continued decline in stock but it may perhaps stabilize and be, well, a bargain&#8230; if it goes back up to $700+</p>
<p>They also very much relate to Apple accepting way lower profit margins than before with the iPad Mini, and cannibalizes its own product with a less profitable one (absolutely and relatively, of course).</p>
<p>That seems incredible to me.</p>
<p>There is something genuinely in my heart for Stephen Colbert that no one else shares.</p>
<p>Is the Mitt Romney?</p>
<p>Apple is becoming a company we laugh at and this sort of behavior is why. If every news of new product of yours is made fun of and you keep on litigating even though you are the most popular tech company now. It&#8217;s sad. Well the iPad vs Surface ad says it all. We find every new Apple stuff funny <br />

<p>Many  were already making fun of Apple well before the litigation. Remember Ballmer laughing at the original iPhone?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s what you get when you&#8217;re at the top. You have everyone else criticising everyone you do.</p>
<p>Just like you criticising Ballmer?</p>
<p>How is citing something somebody did criticising them?</p>
<p>First they laugh at it. Then a few years later they copy it. Then they laugh at Apple protecting what they worked hard to achieve.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the price of being the best in a world of wannabes I suppose.</p>
<p>I wish that all companies could contribute and promote innovation but I guess that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>No, we&#8217;re laughing at Apple trying to take the honors for other companies innovations. Like suing manufacturers of tablets because they&#8217;re tablets.</p>
<p>I wonder what came first, Apple&#8217;s needs for litigations or their lack of innovations? Is this why people are exiting the company now?</p>

<p>Do you seriously believe that &#8220;lack of innovation&#8221; bullshit?</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t you instead be  talking to Google about not putting LTE on their flagship phones or something?</p>
<p>As if their last flagship didn&#8217;t have lte?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t the Galaxy Nexus have LTE, last year?</p>
<p>Which they dropped, this year.</p>
<p>and selling the flagship at half price?</p>
<p>Yes, drop specs and make it cheaper &#8211; true innovation right there.</p>
<p>Dropped specs? Snapdragon S4 Pro murders Omap 4, 768p lcd beats 720p pentile, 2gb ram &gt; 1gb, 8mp camera &gt; 5mp, and 2100 mah battery bests 1750 mah .</p>
<p>It just dropped LTE..its not even developed yet. All other specs r fantastic..infact its faster than iphone 5.</p>
<p>Your trolling is pretty innovative if you ask me&#8230;</p>
<p>Wow really the Nexus 4 has dropped specs REALLY? haha.</p>
<p>Okay, so&#8230; In your imaginary world Apple are more innovative because they introduce the tech a year later&#8230; because the new Nexus, which isn&#8217;t even made by Samsung, doesn&#8217;t have LTE?</p>
<p>Oooookay&#8230;.</p>
<p>No, because Apple introduce a phone that not only integrates LTE, but is thinner, stronger, lighter, has a longer battery life  and still beats anything else in processing performance so developers have a prime platform to develop their ideas.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I call innovation. Maybe your definition is different and more suited to your reality.</p>
<p>stronger?</p>
<p>Just to stir the pot, Xcode is hard as hell to set up for a person that has never used it before. The eclipse SDK took under an hour to install and set up. I made an app. I feel much more comfortable with that than Xcode. Does it help my point that I was using a MacBook?</p>
<p>Really? Xcode is pretty much ready to go for iOS and OSX development as soon as you start it.</p>
<p>Eclipse and the Android SDK isn&#8217;t particularly taxing either, I&#8217;m not sure why it&#8217;d take you an hour if you aren&#8217;t taking in download times.</p>
<p>Xcode is hard to setup? Really!?!  My first install (2009) took about 10 minutes and my most recent  (July) took a few minutes. What was so complicated?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about Xcode, but I do have to say it was incredibly easy to get Visual Studio working for Windows Phone development. Far easier than Eclipse, and I&#8217;ve been a Java developer longer than I&#8217;ve been a C# one.</p>
<p>Your reality seems pretty distorted.</p>
<p>You mean they took the same phone, made it an inch longer ,and played catch up and called it innovation.</p>
<p>Android (what the story is about) is software. The phone (which the story is not about) is hardware. I can see why you are confused.</p>
<p>How does jelly bean infringe apples patents? Oh, I guess that one about universal search. Maybe? Jelly bean doesn&#8217;t use bounce back.</p>
<p>The bounce back patent was thrown out already. Its no event a patent any more.</p>
<p>If they are so innovative why cant they add a simple bluetooth file sharing :P and adding 1extra row of icons doesnt change anything. They have the same design inside n outside..gawd..how boring can they get.</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s defintion of innovation is making something new, not taking existing ideas and polishing them up (which seems to be your definition of innovation). <br />
So yeah, I think his view is more suited to reality and not just his reality, but one shared by all rational people</p>
<p>GSM galaxy nexus did not have LTE. VZW Galaxy Nexus is not &#8220;flagship&#8221; software was always late and I ended up just learning to compile it myself. It lost the sense of a Nexus because updates that were less than 100MB got put off for ages when all the cool GSM people had it. The VZW Galaxy Nexus was a &#8220;ya do one for them, ya do one for yourself&#8221;. to me at least.</p>
<p>I fail to see how that is in any way lacking innovation, maybe you should look up the word.</p>
<p>Why, is dropping specs and communication speeds called innovation in your dictionary?</p>
<p>did you just say the Nexus 4 &#8220;dropping specs&#8221;? wow&#8230;where have you been? and there is HSPA+, you know.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve proven yourself to not be worth my time.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t unsee that split infinitive.</p>
<p>If you have no friends to send pictures of  cats ( or genitalia) to, then you don&#8217;t mind the lack of LTE.</p>
<p>How much speed do you actually get with LTE..and dont forget iphones LTE works in very few countries..whereas HSPA+ works in almost every country. In my country i get 7-10mbps in hspa+ n thats preety good. LTE is also there and it avg speed is around 40-60mbps but it does not support iphone&#8217;s frequency..like i said LTE is not yet developed. Use ur brains sumtimes and do sum research. Wts the internet for.</p>
<p>With my iphone there is a very noticeable difference compared to my old iphone, and I&#8217;m on AT&amp;T in Detroit &#8211; supposedly a poorly deployed network in a, well, poorly developed city.<br />
The speedtest app routinely shows &gt;25/10 (up/down).<br />
The nexus 4 looks great but I&#8217;d never go back to a non-LTE phone.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s this garbage about dropping specs you&#8217;ve been spouting? The only thing they didn&#8217;t include is LTE, which the GSM variant didn&#8217;t have anyway. LTE is not a standard. Its broken and its a mess. Google wanted to make ONE phone that would be compatible with virtually any GSM carrier in the world. Creating specific LTE models for each carrier is expensive and would&#8217;ve pushed the price of the Nexus 4 to similar levels as any other flagship. Apart from that, its top end in every other way. Its got bleeding edge specs and apart from the GPU, beats the iPhone 5 in everything. It has NFC, Miracast and 4.2 JellyBean is years ahead of the lame joke that is iOS 6. Where exactly is this innovation on recent Apple products that you talk of?<br />
And yeah, come and babble here when you can buy a 16 GB current-gen iPhone for $350.</p>
<p>No, i held it back the first time, but now i think you deserve to be flagged.</p>
<p>Having LTE or not is not innovation ok. If ur country doesnt have good HSPA speed thats not others problem.</p>
<p>Apple has the smallest budget for R&amp;D among big players, but the most effective one: many use Apple&#8217;s innovations and throw out their own, despite of much larger R&amp;D budget they poured.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t use their innovation, they use their balls. Meaning they won&#8217;t come up with something new unless it&#8217;s proven.</p>
<p>How about keeping to the facts instead? Samsung and others has much bigger R&amp;D budgets because they&#8217;re hardware manufacturers. Because they&#8217;re involved in a heck of a lot more markets and products than Apple. Remember, Samsung literally produce and sell anything from tiny chips to refrigerators, televisions, tanks, cars, ships, real estate&#8230;.</p>
<p>How about Nokia and their R&amp;D?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been in manufacturing of both phone hardware and network hardware for 30 years. Apple don&#8217;t manufacture, they assemble. No need for patents then.</p>
<p>Oh here I was thinking Apple had developed their own range of computers since 1976 and still actively develop in many areas including display technology, ARM designs and Flash memory.</p>
<p>Must be my imagination.</p>
<p>are you seriously comparing the markets that Nokia and Apple are in?</p>
<p>Whaswrongwitchu?</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s comparing the markets? We&#8217;re talking about effectiveness of R&amp;D expenditure.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;m really not: confusing the Nokia Siemens Networks (carrier infrastructure)  joint venture with the main Nokia company, unlike the parent poster.</p>
<p>Industrial design is not R&amp;D. Apple&#8217;s R&amp;D is not as effective as you might think. For $2.5bn they managed to produce a manually laid out CPU core and a new LCD panel.</p>
<p>Everything else is external R&amp;D or industrial design.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s miniscule compared to what the likes of Samsung, LG or even Nokia do. Nokia has a network business too. Heard of Nokia Siemens? And Samsung? Samsung&#8217;s electronics division itself is bigger than Apple and does a TON more R&amp;D and actually creates a majority of the stuff that goes into Apple products. They are real manufacturers. Its foolish to compare Apple and Samsung. Similarly LG. You&#8217;re blinkered and are looking at just phones, tablets and computers.</p>
<p>If Apple were just assembler, why Samsung and Google ask patent royalty to Apple? The royalty is already paid when Apple bought the components from manufacturers.</p>
<p>What was Apple&#8217;s defence there? You&#8217;re just confirmed what I wrote.</p>
<blockquote>The royalty is already paid when Apple bought the components from manufacturers.</blockquote>
<p>That is not always the case, some components include patent licenses and some don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Tell me the list of innovation from iphone4 &#8211; 5. Actually from 1 -5.</p>
<p>Bitch please.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s R&amp;D is &#8216;soft&#8217; R&amp;D. Its about taking existing third party technologies, tightly integrating them and then iterating till a successful combination is found. Its not &#8216;hard R&amp;D&#8217;, they don&#8217;t create genuinely new technologies like IBM, LG, Samsung etc.. (Admittedly, Apple does influence the direction of a lot of &#8216;hard&#8217; R&amp;D. What the biggest customer wants, gets). Its foolhardy to compare R&amp;D effectiveness when the goals of those R&amp;D programs are substantially different.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funny is that Apple sets record profits what seems like every quarter but&#8230;wasn&#8217;t there a report in which they ranked behind several other companies in the amount of money they invest in R&amp;D? I&#8217;m sure someone can get that source. Apple&#8217;s hardware is beautiful, but its OS is showing its age. Especially when compared to the latest versions of Android. It doesn&#8217;t take an Android fanboy to see that. I have several friends and family that have seen its limitations. Apple is feeling the heat.</p>
<p>The only reason the os is showing its age is because it has been out there for five years now and doesn&#8217;t change every quarter. That&#8217;s because Apple built it right from he start. They knew they wanted a simple, multi touch os that would scale nicely on only a few portable devices with arm architecture. Android on the other hand is a mess that was created from both qwerty and touch screen devices with a ton of screen sizes and he lowest common denominator of processors to support al those crappy no name phone brands out there. So when you say Apple doesn&#8217;t change it&#8217;s software enough, you&#8217;re right. But why should they when they did it right in the first place?</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should they when they did it right in the first place?&#8221;<br />
&#8230;<br />
In your opinion. I&#8217;ve personally never liked their too simple design. They force simplicity upon their users. Most people would never be limited with the simplicity, as they ain&#8217;t &#8220;geeks&#8221;. However the young generations are much better at technology in general and know how to setup their phone. Thus simplicity will be in the way. The advantage with android is the choices.</p>
<p>A bit of a silly comparison:<br />
iPhone = The dictator, tells you what you can do with your phone.<br />
Android = The rebel, you can do what ever you want within reason.</p>
<p>True story: my dad needed to upgrade from a BlackBerry Curve 8330&#8230;let that sink in for a little while&#8230;I suggested he get an iPhone because it&#8217;s simple and he&#8217;ll get the hang of it quickly.  My dad is 62 years old.  He ended up choosing a Galaxy S2, learned how to use it all on his own, and loves it.  I asked him why he didn&#8217;t get the iPhone and he said the screen was too small and that it was too simplistic.  iPhone does a lot of things well, but it&#8217;s a boring OS.  Even for old people.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, they did do it right the first time.  That&#8217;s why they didn&#8217;t feel the need to add multitasking or a notification center in later versions, right? Oh, wait&#8230;iOS does what it does well.  That is, it&#8217;s great at being a very boring OS.  Don&#8217;t  take my word for it though, go ahead and ask some of the people that have been using it for the last few years.  That&#8217;s where I got my information from.  Regular people that don&#8217;t go on thes tech blogs and flame out.  That&#8217;s right, flame out.  To quote my sister as she swiped between screens of apps, &#8220;That&#8217;s all it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>lemme fix it for you</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they laugh at Apple, litigating because it cant compete anymore&#8221;</p>
<p>It keeps happening and it will continue to do so, Apple releases a product that revolutionizes,  the others scramble to compete, Apple holds the crown for 2 or 3 years, then competition mauls the crown out of Apple&#8217;s hands and Apple is forced into a minority&#8230;. Apple&#8217;s cycle is more or less the same deal that with iMacs and OSX vs. Windows and &#8220;PC&#8221;.</p>
<p>Holy hell! Learn the difference between popularizing and innovating already!!!!</p>
<p>Please explain the difference to us all. As I see it, innovative things can be popular and popular things can be innovative. In fact, the popular part is probably more important than the originality of the innovation. Edison didn&#8217;t harness and create distribution for electricity first but he popularized it. He innovated AC power distribution and commoditized it. But I suppose he didn&#8217;t innovate anything either.</p>
<p>Edison didn&#8217;t invent AC power. In fact, he was against AC power. Edison was also an asshole.</p>
<p>Exactly. Edison was for DC power. Could you imagine what it would look like outside if all the power plants were pushing DC to the houses?</p>
<p>Nikolai Tesla FTW.</p>
<p>&#8230;.. Damn you new Swype-ish Android keyboard&#8230;.<br />
Nikola*</p>
<p>Innovating means creating something original. Popularizing means to take something that already exists in some form, tweaking it slightly and then bringing it to the masses. All of Apple&#8217;s products were popularizations of existing concepts.</p>
<p>Also as already mentioned Edison was for DC power and used to electrocute animals to &#8220;demonstrate&#8221; the dangers of AC power. So yes, he was a dbag.</p>
<p>In your mind, and in the minds of those who think like you, is Apple the only company in the world that innovates?</p>
<blockquote>I wish that all companies could contribute and promote innovation but I guess that’s not going to happen.</blockquote>
<p>Except that Google never laughed at Apple and Apple is hardly contributing anything. These lawsuits are exactly the opposite of &#8220;contribute&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yea, too bad there aren&#8217;t any real innovators. Look Microsoft, blatantly copying iOS and OSX.</p>
<p>Tell me one patent that Apple holds that is related to the core technology and functionality of their products. One. When did they ever research on core networking technology? When did they ever research and come up with better screen tech? Samsung and all of these other &#8220;copycats&#8221; you talk about, however, very much make sure that you get faster data, or voice at all, or better screens, etc. They innovate the CORE technology. Apple just does look &amp; feel. It innovates there, but nowhere else, so get off your high horse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how we automatically attribute a sense of mockery and derision to the plaintiff as if suing is a bad thing. It&#8217;s surprising that this is just is the case, because the law is first and foremost made to protect the innovator.</p>
<p>I am not saying that the defendant must lose; but the automatic attribution of sick jokes to the plaintiff is not pleasing any body except for the trolls on all these websites. There&#8217;s this law; it is practiced. Apple wasn&#8217;t the first to sue; it never was. It&#8217;s following on others steps and the boundary conditions of the patent law and trying to set things straight.</p>
<p>Maybe you never made shit you so you feel this way; but unfortunately there&#8217;s a law that protects innovations; Apple&#8217;s using it. Deal with it.</p>
<blockquote>Apple wasn’t the first to sue; it never was</blockquote>
<p>I can imagine an alternate plane of existence where Apple is suing people for suing people.</p>
<p>I am sure you will still be trolling in that alternate plane of existence.</p>
<p>Just like your lips will still be flapping&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>Apple wasn’t the first to sue; it never was.</blockquote>
<p>Only one problem. There are things called verifiable facts that say that this statements is factually incorrect. Apple sued HTC and Samsung first. Apple sued Microsoft, back in the 80ies.</p>
<p>80ies.  That&#8217;s funny&#8230;I&#8217;ve never seen it written like that before&#8230;that&#8217;s like eightyies.</p>
<p>Hey grammar nazi. You do realise that that is because it&#8217;s spelled eighties?</p>
<p>Hey &#8211; how&#8217;s it going?  I do realize that.  I wasn&#8217;t correcting your grammar or being a nazi.  More of a spelling issue than a grammar issue anyway.</p>
<p>80 is pronounced eighty.  If you write out 80ies it would be eightyies. Normally you just see 80&#8217;s or 80s.  I just thought it looked funny.</p>
<p>Haha, 8ies then :D</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually an excellent point.  Does the same go for the 70ies and the 90ies?  It&#8217;s hard not to read that as 70 IE&#8217;s, which is kind of a nightmare :P</p>
<p>Its quite ironic that this video makes fun of Garageband when Windows Marketplace is in dire state.</p>
<p>Those ads can be hilarious as you want. The Surface RT is still a load of shit that can&#8217;t even run Cut The Rope properly.</p>
<p>It does run Cut the Rope properly.</p>
<p>When I downloaded the Dev Preview the thing wouldn&#8217;t even open<br />
Now it&#8217;s out,  and lags REALLY badly on Windows RT.</p>
<p>Cut the Rope only lags a bit in one area .. the &#8220;world&#8221; select (as opposed to the stage select).  The actual gameplay is fluid.  Not sure why the world select lags, but there&#8217;s two ways to look at the issue:<br />
1) it&#8217;s the first thing people see, so that&#8217;s very bad<br />
2) it&#8217;s where you spend the absolute least amount of time, so it&#8217;s not important.</p>
<p>take your pick</p>
<p>Thank for the linky :D</p>
<p>nice ad : )</p>
<p>You&#8217;re kidding right? Surface has gotten bad reviews all the way across the board. Truly DOA. Obnoxious dubstep on a fake ad isn&#8217;t going to sell surface tablets. Give your head a shake.</p>
<p>Probably best that way. If you say anything, Apple could sue, since it&#8217;s probably copyrighted.</p>
<p>I have some. Apple, stop spouting absolute BS.</p>
<p>They no longer innovate,they are failing to shoe me anything that i would consider real innovative stuff. The only wsy they can TRY to slow down the Android machine is litigation. Once these illegal patents are revisited by the courts and they will because theyre ridiculous, Apple will be in BIG,BIG trouble. They are fighting inside company Apple , just the beginning of the end. Fuck Apple.</p>
<p>ENOUGH ALREADY. I&#8217;m Pro-Apple (Currently) but this is just ridiculous!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Pro-Apple in this case because Samsung needs a slap and stop copying everythin g(and i don&#8217;t mean swipe to unlock or rounded corners, i  mean &#8220;S-Voice&#8221; and the first Galaxy and all that shit).<br />
And you&#8217;re totally right. This shit needs to stop. This is like a tech kindergarden. The cool kids are fighting while MS and Nokia are watching &#8211; but the latter will be the more successfull at the end.</p>
<p>Samsung didn&#8217;t create Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Your argument is invalid.</p>
<p>Tell Samsung to drop the iPhone 5 lawsuit they rushed int then.</p>
<p>Tell Apple to stop they lawsuits, and they will probably stop.<br />
They&#8217;re just &#8220;defending&#8221; themselves.</p>
<p>All companies are just &#8220;defending&#8221; themselves aren&#8217;t they.</p>
<p>When Samsung never attacks somebody, and only uses his patents on the one that attacks them. Then yeah.</p>
<p>About the others, that&#8217;s a big comma, here Apple is all thermonuclear on Android.</p>
<p>Considering some revelations in Jobs&#8217; biography, Apple is not defending anything.</p>
<p>Samsung loaded it onto their hardware and sold it.  I guess that&#8217;s where Apple seems to feel that they have legal footing here.</p>
<p>What Apple feels is the people&#8217;s balls in their hands, and are squeezing as hard as they can while many people don&#8217;t seem to care.</p>
<p>They are going after Android and are using their recent win on the US Samsung lawsuit as leverage.  The way claims on these software patents gain traction is when they are tied to hardware.  But in reality Apple seems to sincerely think they invented fucking smart phones and no one else is allowed to make any.</p>
<p>Wake the F up, dammit.  Without competition we&#8217;d end up in that 1984 scenario Apple itself was railing on 28 years ago..</p>
<p>They can shove they damn lawsuits where the sun don&#8217;t shine.</p>
<p>*adult language used for emphasis because this pisses me off. I hope no one is offended.</p>
<p>The whole things a mess, I agree.  I&#8217;m waiting to see some updates to this article that explain things a little better.  There&#8217;s a surprising amount of fluff here.</p>
<p>Filings here : <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20121106215405759" target="_blank">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20121106215405759</a></p>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<p>If apple believed they invented all smartphones they would go after windows phone and that os too. They are not. They continually go after Samsun and is android operating system which everyone agrees beats more than a passing resemblance to patents that apple owns. I suppose you would give a company notorious for ripping off others a pass though.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably not seen Apple&#8217;s licensing offer to Samsung? WP7 was on the list of devices that would require a license(though with a discount).  <br />
So yeah, while they aren&#8217;t going for those devices in the lawsuits, they do actually believe that those infringe on their patents as well.(and we have court verified proof of that)</p>
<p>apple and microsoft were dominating and dictating the market to their own benefits and in several occasions they helped each other out to keep it that way. android came out of nowhere, and it did not play by the &#8220;rules,&#8221; which meant customers get cheap but capable devices, which they fully own, progress is ongoing and they&#8217;re not milked for every little feature. i can understand they both hate android, the carriers hate android and the manufacturers hate android, even samsung which keeps an outdated version of android alive, skinned to look like iOS, to milk their customers. its actually nice that this OS came so far, pissing all over these bloodsucking companies &#8211; and its about time.</p>
<p>I agree with the Samsung part too (Mainly &#8216;S-Voice&#8217;) but JELLYBEAN? THAT&#8217;S PURE GOOGLE.</p>
<p>But Google doesn&#8217;t charge for it?  And I would be realllly interested to see Google get involved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like Samsung could end up being Google&#8217;s &#8220;Pearl Harbor&#8221;.</p>
<p>I would love to see Apple start pokimg at Gpogle only to have Google (pardon my language) bitch-slap the crap out of Apple&#8217;s lawyers because they think they can make money off of these rediculous lawsuits and stuff. That would totally make my day. Because some of the things Apple is suing for are ridiculous. (My opinion. Hope I don&#8217;t offend anyone here)</p>
<p>Get a clue.  S Voice is based on Vlingo which was out long before Sori.</p>
<p>And then they changed it to give it speech bubbles, a single button with an audio form wave, pretty much the same personality, and very similarly formatted data.</p>
<p>Just like Apple changed the basic voice input to be a voice assistant when they saw Samsung integrating Vlingo. But that&#8217;s of course not a valid argument&#8230;</p>
<p>The GS II with S Voice was demoed in February 2011. Apple bought Siri in April 28, 2010.</p>
<p>Even if S Voice had come first, you can&#8217;t ignore all the stuff Samsung took from Apple in S Voice. Just because it&#8217;s cosmetic and aesthetic stuff, it adds to joy of use and makes it a completely different product.</p>
<p>And they just decided to put it after Siri with the same appareance.</p>
<p>I dont see how Jellybean has anything to do with the lawsuit against the samsung phones, even when the Galaxy Nexus is a samsung product, the OS version in it has NOTHING to do with Apple&#8217;s infrigement and whatever this whole drama is about.</p>
<p>S voice is an iteration on valingo which was out with the original galaxy s and we&#8217;ll before siri. So I have no idea why that would be a problem, and could be the main reason apple doesn&#8217;t bring that up.</p>
<p>How are you still pro-Apple?</p>
<p>Oh come on, don&#8217;t blame the product &#8211; blame the people!</p>
<p>The product is just as twisted as the people. Aside from the litigiousness of Apple, iOS is one of the most closed systems ever. If you bought a desktop computer where you couldn&#8217;t install any application Apple didn&#8217;t approve of, how would you feel? Apple stopped being innovated at least three years ago. Ever since, they&#8217;ve continued building very high quality HARDWARE, but the software is severely lacking.</p>
<p>Because I love developing for iOS! I admit iOS is outdated compared to Jellybean but I feel more at home developing for iOS (In other words I enjoy the experience from making apps or games). The hardware is great but the software? iOS 6 sucks (Which is why I&#8217;m still on iOS 5..1.1).</p>
<p>Why do you love developing for it when you just said the software sucks? I wouldn&#8217;t ever develop for iOS just out of principle. Locking more people in the future into using iOS and Apple-only products is ridiculous. If you code for Android, it&#8217;s like your app will probably always be around and work on something. I don&#8217;t see iOS lasting more than 5-8 years.</p>
<p>The operating system sucks, doesn&#8217;t mean the apps suck! Besides I said iOS 6 sucks, not iOS 5.1.1 I felt that was the last good update they&#8217;ve done. Also developing for Android is a pain (Long story). Don&#8217;t get me wrong I love Jellybean but if you read one of my posts regarding on why I switched back you&#8217;d understand. iOS will always feel like home to me and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a bit biased against Google. HOWEVER I&#8217;m not blind enough to see that they are just as evil as every other company and that this lawsuit is certainly a ridiculous one!</p>
<p>So, you don&#8217;t use or develop for Android because it doesn&#8217;t have as many good apps as iOS. Catch-22 much?</p>
<p>No&#8230; I don&#8217;t develop for Android because it&#8217;s harder. <del>sigh</del> here we go again. First off I have to modify textures or shaders to match with certain GPUs that each handsets have. When I want to develop for Tegra 3 I have to consider that along with developing for devices without Tegra 3. At times I get annoyed with Java. There are tons of reasons why I chose not to develop for Android not because Android doesn&#8217;t have as many good apps as iOS (Which is BS because Android is catching up on quality apps) Like I said iOS is more of a home to me, it&#8217;s easier for me and it&#8217;s my preference.</p>
<p>Ah, yes the easy way out, always a good way to get ahead and be a successful dev.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is an attack towards my preference but if so, I&#8217;m sorry I chose the &#8216;easy way out&#8217; as I felt it was best for me!</p>
<p>So I guess you might say you&#8230;<br />
&#8230;Took the easy way out.</p>
<p>Are you a developer? No? Do you know Objective C, C++, Java, Python or hell even Ruby on Rails? If you can&#8217;t say yes to any of these then honestly just stop saying &#8216;easy way out&#8217;. So what if it&#8217;s the easy way out? Does it bug you? Is your life okay? Is Android getting hurt that I chose not to develop something? Is your family injured? Sorry I tried being nice but you just pushed it off. You don&#8217;t know the life of being a small team of developers working hard to get an app onto the market. Also not ONCE have I said I&#8217;ll ever stop developing  for Android &#8211; it&#8217;s just not the time yet. Hope you&#8217;re okay with me taking the easy way out and your butt doesn&#8217;t hurt from that.</p>
<p>Let the person be.  He stated why he uses iOS and why he codes for iOS.  Android has a much broader selection of hardware, to the best of my knowledge that will always make it harder to code for at worst and just about the same as iOS at best.  I hear you FatalWish.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Fair enough. I understand and respect your choice. Nothing wrong in it.</p>
<p>Thanks, don&#8217;t get me wrong my team and I will attempt to develop for Android it&#8217;s just not suitable for us as a team right now. Android and iOS but only if Apple stops this BS. Thanks for understanding!</p>
<p>*Android and iOS can be the future for us &#8211; I wish there was an edit function AFAIK I don&#8217;t see one!</p>
<p>Do you know how tired your arguments are?</p>
<p>(Android user here, since 2010)</p>
<p>Actually from a developer standpoint no matter how &#8220;tired&#8221; the argument still is, its still true.</p>
<p>What would you do if you were required to created 3 or 4 different files for everything you did at work?, or if you were required to do you work at the same time for 4 different clients wanting the same thing, but in different languages?</p>
<p>This is no different than the age when a web developer had to make almost 3 full pages in order to make them work with all browsers.</p>
<p>In that time we used &#8220;Best seen with xxxx at yyyyxyyy resolution&#8221;, now we say &#8220;It&#8217;s better on iOS because it&#8217;s simpler than all the different flavors of Android&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh please, Samsung went straight in with a lawsuit against the iPhone 5 after launch.</p>
<p>Did you seriously expect Apple to sit there and watch Samesung drag its flagship product through legal without any counter response?</p>
<p>This  is about Jellybean not Samsung&#8217;s flagship products.</p>
<p>Was writing about Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5, which Samsung immediately sued Apple for just after launch, remember?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3441914/samsung-apple-iphone-5-lawsuit" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3441914/samsung-apple-iphone-5-lawsuit</a></p>
<p>Kids who use words like samesung are honestly impossible to take serious.</p>
<p>Good lord, the sun will still rise tomorrow.  Apple will still release nifty SoCs on their iDevices, Google will still write funky search data based prediction services, and Samsung will still sell lots of active digitizer based large smartphones.  I can&#8217;t see how anyone can still get stressed out over this stuff.</p>
<p>This is 100% sarcasm-free.<br />

<p>Google should send a package to try to mend relations with Tim Cook. A jar of jelly beans to be exactly.</p>
<p>Maybe a horse&#8217;s head&#8230;</p>
<p>This guy has the right idea</p>
<p>Android extermination pledge will be sufficient.</p>
<p>Of course they do.</p>
<p>They should just preventively add anything Google comes up with from this point on and say it was stolen.  Fuck it.</p>
<p>So, basically, they&#8217;re calling out Android.  The fact that it&#8217;s on a Nexus is irrelevant when it&#8217;s stock Android.  Okay, Google, why are you continuing to stand on the sidelines with this?</p>
<p>oh boy. i would hate to see the comments if Google ever went on the offensive.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s about time Google step in instead of letting Samsung fight all be themselves. This is aiming directly at your heart, can&#8217;t let this continue.</p>
<p>This was always ridiculous,  but now it&#8217;s totally out of hand. Apple is whining like a spoiled child. But anybody notice this comes as soon as a report came out stating that their tablet market share has been reduced to only 50% and Android on the whole is being adopted 6 to 1 compared to iOS</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure Google is providing massive assistance and legal counsel to Samsung without being directly involved as they&#8217;re not named in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that Apple and Google has a lot of agreements that have defensive clauses. Suing each other would trigger them. So it&#8217;s not really in Google&#8217;s or  Apple&#8217;s interests to start first.</p>
<p>Enough, please.</p>
<p>Apple2012. Argue for everything you can.</p>
<p>Thinking of buying a Lumia, as a way of voting with my wallet.</p>
<p>Nexu 4 for me.</p>
<p>Thinking of buying a Llama, as a way of voting for free sweaters.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tAQH7.png" /></p>
<p>Fuck Apple. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>Yeah, samsung&#8217;s not really helping though.</p>
<p>By having Jelly Bean on some of their phones?  Oh, the audacity!</p>
<p>No, by suing the iPhone 5 when it came out &#8211; and at least copying 100 pages worth of features.</p>
<p>Android has more features then iOS, plain and simple. I mean I seriously laughed when Apple said at the iPhone 5 event, &#8220;Introducing Panorama mode&#8221; , Yea, I&#8217;ve been using it since ICS came out! And you Apple fans lap it up, it&#8217;s like you let them get away with selling you the same overpriced product year after year with a few added features that are nothing special but because it&#8217;s Apple all of a sudden it&#8217;s the best thing ever. I also laughed when they said &#8220;You now get an extra row of icons&#8221; Oh&#8230;.gggrrreeeaaatttt. Everyone copies everyone at the end of the day (yes even Apple copy) but Apple are playing dirty by trying to stifle competition. If ever WP8 get&#8217;s a nice bit of marketshare, I guarantee they go after WP8 devices.</p>
<p>This joke is far from over.</p>
<p>I guarantee 100% that Apple will not go after WP8 devices since Microsoft and Apple have a mutual agreement that prevents this.</p>
<p>As for Panorama I was using apps that did it well before the new iOS (and well before ICS), but the one is iOS is quite nicely implemented.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s natural that Android has more features on paper, Google (and Samsung) take the shotgun approach and put everything they can plus the kitchen sink. Do all of those things work even reasonably well? Sorry but no. Things like &#8220;Face Unlock&#8221; in the end are just gimmicks that hardly every work or are too easy to fool to be useful.</p>
<p>Apple may not put in as many but instead focus on things they know they can make work properly and offer a better polished experience &#8211; without rushing out for Butter.</p>
<p>With this &#8220;shotgun&#8221; approach Samsung  tries quite blatantly tried to mimic everything Apple put out. Stuff like S Voice, the home button, the icons etc (detailed in that famous Samsung &#8220;design&#8221; document) are made to be so similar to the point of being comical.</p>
<p>The S3 looks like an iPhone how? The Note, Note 10.1 and Note 2 look like the iPhone how? Samsung had the button first: <img src="http://laughedge.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/hey-apple-who-is-copying-what.jpg" /></p>
<p>New Touchwiz skin looks nothing like iPhones icons: <img src="http://images.itechpost.com/data/images/full/2012/08/28/2308-android-4-1-and-touchwiz-5-for-galaxy-s2-i9100g-how-to-tutorial.jpg" /></p>
<p>You Apple fans use the same old tired arguments that just ain&#8217;t true no more.</p>
<p>What other Android phone from a major manufacturer has a home button?</p>
<p>As for the rest of the copying please spare us the bullshit. I&#8217;m sure you read Samsung&#8217;s own 100+ page document detailing what to copy from iOS. You cannot unsee that.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache.megatechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/apple-patent-500x318.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here’s another example of the pot calling the kettle black and then dusting itself in even more black paint. Apple is set to receive over one billion dollars from Samsung for patent infringements, but it looks like Apple isn&#8217;t exactly opposed to copying other people’s ideas either. In fact, they’re going even further and trying to patent other people’s ideas.<br />
What you see here is an Apple patent for a "face unlock" feature on an iPhone.</p>
<p>As for you&#8217;re other question about home buttons:<br />
<img src="http://cdn2.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net//Review%20images/TechRadar/Mobile%20phones/Sony%20Ericsson/Xperia%20Mini%20Pro/xperia-mini-pro-hands-on/mini-pro-hands-on-1-580-90.jpg" /></p>
<p>Get your facts right.</p>
<p>Apple applied for that face unlock patent well before Google. <br />
Apple actually got that technology from their purchase of Swedish firm Polar Rose in 2010.</p>
<p>I also see three buttons on that Xperia, not 1 home button.</p>
<p>You asked: What other Android phone from a major manufacturer has a home button?</p>
<p>And there it is. If you are going to be nit-picking like that then Samsung&#8217;s count as 3, I certainly see 3:<img src="http://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2012/06/06/279705.jpg" /></p>
<p>Oh&#8230;no&#8230;I forgot, It&#8217;s a Samsung phne so Apple fans can only see the one button! Silly me!</p>
<p>So erm..get you&#8217;re facts right&#8230;.bro!</p>
<p>TROLOLOLOL</p>
<p>nice usage of knowledge, thanks for shutting that idiot up (hopefully)</p>
<p>I like your comments, benrees. Am your reader :)</p>
<p>The same three buttons that EVERY Android device has had since ever. Typically ignorant iFanboy. /sigh</p>
<blockquote>Apple applied for that face unlock patent well before Google.</blockquote>
<p>:D &#8220;face unlock patent&#8221;</p>
<p>So important innovation to be patented&#8230; Curious, how many scientist were involved into the innovation process, making prototype, testing it and put into the production.</p>
<p>I bet it takes years and lots of brain activity&#8230;</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t that be Apple&#8217;s 2 page document? I mean, not much yiu can do with that stale OS really.</p>
<p>That was back with the Galaxy S1 and maybe the S2. But you Apple fans still insist they are copying Apple NOW. When they are clearly not, proved by my pictures (of current Touchwiz skin) and their current design of the S3, Note, Note 10.1 and Note 2. Guess what, they are not copies of iPhone and they still sell loads!! Does it hurt you to see and know that???</p>
<p>ath0&#8217;s reply: But&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;But&#8230;&#8230;.erm&#8230;..I&#8217;m going now. Going to stare at my icons on my iClone. OOOoooOOOhhhh shiny!!!</p>
<p>Good god! Just because it has a home button it does not mean it has been copied from Apple. <br />
WTF are you high on? Tim Cook&#8217;s poop?!</p>
<p>Actually they all do, they are not capacitive buttons but they are definitely home buttons. Also phones before Iphone had home button- placed under the screen ( home button is most certainly not apple invention)</p>
<p>jeeze stop it already apple this is getting old</p>
<p>Yeah Apple. That&#8217;s really all you can. Just stay on your laurel. No need to innovate anymore. Just rise the prices up. Trick more on how to not pay taxes. You are so cool. Eventually get fat and die bitch!</p>

<p>Not that different from Samsung or other Tech companies.</p>
<p>Hah!</p>
<p>If Apple&#8217;s yearly track record is no different from any other tech companies (I disagree btw), then why is Apple so loved and protected by the media? They basically released 4 rather predictable hardware refreshes, 1 new product based on a competitors&#8217;s formula, and one sw release with some major issues. The rest of their public activity was&#8230; lawsuit lawsuit and more lawsuit.</p>
<p>Are you forgetting Apple&#8217;s entire Mac line and OSX for some reason?</p>
<p>Forgot OSX, sorry.</p>
<p>Maybe&#8230; because they&#8217;re.. erm&#8230; forgettable?</p>
<p>Apple is everywhere in the media because it paid to be placed there.</p>
<p>wait, why add JB?</p>
<p>what has been infringed?</p>
<p>this doesnt even make sense.</p>
<p>unless im mistaken APPLE are the ones copying from google&#8230;not vice versa.</p>
<p>google should&#8217;ve seen this coming @ iphone1 and simply pulled all their support&#8230;</p>
<p>this is what happens when you build your competitors up, they bite the hand that feeds them.</p>
<p>Google had shit at iPhone 1. Apple going with them was the best thing that ever happened to them, even Schmidt said so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that Internet is the best thing that happened to Google&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what has been infringed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of electrons.  No one else is allowed to do that except Apple.</p>
<p>ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha</p>
<p>Probably some lockscreen bullshit and a couple icons.</p>
<p>Exactly! The shit they&#8217;re pissing their pants about tend to be trivial things. They (Apple) appear to be solidly in the &#8220;I&#8217;m bigger than you, so I&#8217;m going to try to push you around&#8221; camp and they&#8217;re finding any tiny, inconsequential thing to try and throw around. I REALLY hope that this will result in a huge backlash for them. A tainted company, and a tarnished brand is just what they deserve for being so goddamn petty.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#8217;m done now.</p>
<p>Yep.  Seems like the only way out is to create a device that you have got absolutely no reason to touch or look at.</p>
<p>Time to Innovate&#8230;lol that could be a campaign slogan.</p>
<p>And that seems to be exactly the problem that is leading to this behavior &#8211; where do they go from here to maintain their stature?</p>
<p>Though I suppose this is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>Anyway and on that note, take a look at this futuretech &#8594;  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz17lbjOFn8" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz17lbjOFn8</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty cool video.  I could see something like that getting paired up with Project Glass.</p>
<p><strong>Grabs popcorn</strong></p>
<p>Please no popcorn again. Get something else.</p>
<p><strong>Grabs Jelly Beans</strong></p>
<p>Grabs Sonic</p>
<p>Agreed the &#8220;Hole in the bottom of the popcorn bucket&#8221; gag gets old.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s equidistant from all sides, then Apple has a patent on that and you&#8217;re gonna be sued into the dark ages. Want some butter with that?</p>
<p>I would actually like to know what they think Jellybean infringes. Especially since Google went out of their way to specifically design around Apple patents.</p>
<p>Slide to unlock was amended to be a slide in any direction. And, they could try and say Google Now infringes on the on-device search patent.</p>
<p>Google specifically stated that Google Now works around the universal search patent by sticking to online search sources.</p>
<p>Yeah they issued an OTA update to all American GNexus&#8217; (Nexi?) to remove the Unified search to work around that patent as far as I remember. <br />
I really can&#8217;t think of anything that would infringe in Jellybean as it stands.</p>
<p>It could just be a bullying tactic and a way for a smaller company to spend millions defending themselves against and obviously pointless lawsuit.</p>
<p>A slide in any direction with no set starting point, no set stopping point, no specific location, and no predetermined distance.</p>
<p>Not joking.</p>
<p>And the distance can be zero and still infringe according to Apple. In other words, you can&#8217;t unlock a phone by touching the screen in any way.</p>
<p>Another day, another dispute. I&#8217;d say this is getting ridiculous, but to be honest, it&#8217;s far beyond it.</p>
<p>A part of me wants to see Google go &#8217;Fuck this. No Apple products can use ANY Google service. No Search, Gmail, Maps (yeah yeah), Chrome, and what have you..</p>
<p>Ahh well, to be honest, Goog needs the Apple users more than Apple needs Google services.<br />
Pushing those Mac users deeper into the Apple ecosystem isn&#8217;t a good plan.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve gotta to the reverse.  More and better access to Google services.  Get them addicted to Google Crack instead of Apple Crack.</p>
<p>A lot of Apple owners quickly learned that their devices are nearly useless without world class services like Google Maps, Navigation and Streetview.</p>
<p>You got to be kidding.</p>
<p>Nope. My wife used the maps and streetview a lot for quickly showing real estate, etc to clients. She has a Galaxy Note 2 now.</p>
<p>You know there&#8217;s streetview on the web now and there&#8217;s an app for that too. Can&#8217;t believe that was the whole reason, especially not for a Note 2.</p>
<p>Pretty certain that she wanted to make things out on the display while holding it naturally at waist level hence she got the Galaxy Note II instead of the iPhone5 that would require holding it up to her face and squint.</p>
<p>That was a terrible bait-and-switch. Better luck next time.</p>
<p>Do you really want to give Bing a boost big enough to rival Google? If Google EVER drops iOS support they&#8217;d lose BILLIONS of searches and Apple would have no where else to go but MS.</p>
<p>Steve Ballmer&#8217;s wet dream come true, Google&#8217;s worst nightmare.</p>
<p>PS: Typed on my iPhone 5 ; )</p>
<p>Bing &#8211; only useful in US.</p>
<p>Wrong, bing maps has the best maps for Europe. The bird view etc.</p>
<p>Except that we are talking about search.</p>
<p>PS: Bing Maps are good? Draw a vertical line through Copenhagen. Everything left of that line is acceptable and everything to the right is barely acceptable.</p>
<p>Just murdering any urge I have to buy any Apple device ever again.</p>
<p>I hope engadget reported on this because I know the comments over there will be fun.</p>
<p>Guys. Calm down. This will fade away in time. Android isn&#8217;t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>Samsung asked for this when then sued Apple over the iPh9!3 5 right after launch.</p>
<p>go go Apple :)</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; Go Apple! &#8220;Steal&#8221; technology from others and turn around and say that you were stolen from.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-07/apple-told-to-pay-368-2-million-to-virnetx-in-patent-trial-1-.html">Apple Told to Pay $368.2 Million to VirnetX in Trial</a></p>
<p>Oh so if its Apple that pays its just fine, if its the other way around patent system is broken.</p>
<p>That was never my position. I&#8217;m just pointing out the hypocrisy of Apple and fanbois.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine with both Apple paying up for its screw-ups just like I&#8217;m fine with others paying Apple.</p>
<p>Something the Verge failed to mention.  Which make apple look like even bigger asses:<br />
<a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/11/05/federal-judge-dismisses-apples-wisconsin-lawsuit-against-motorola-with-prejudice/" target="_blank">http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/11/05/federal-judge-dismisses-apples-wisconsin-lawsuit-against-motorola-with-prejudice/</a></p>
<p>Why does trying to defend from a Motorola patent attack make Apple bigger asses?</p>
<p>Motorola are the ones pulling the dick move of using FRAND to impose product bans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple, however, said it would only agree to this if the court&#8217;s determination were a maximum of $1.00 per iPhone to license the patents.&#8221;<br />
HAHAHAHAH</p>
<p>Most other wireless patent pools charge around 70c-99c  for similar standard essential patents, $1 per unit is well within the industry average pay.</p>
<p>Any proof or it is your usual pro Apple nonsense?</p>
<p>Ps, Nokia got a 2% from Apple fior their FRAND patents according to all the sources. Qualcomm has been asking almost a 4% for their patents.</p>
<p>No, if there is a failure to pay for the FRAND patents, it&#8217;s understandable to try and impose a product ban.</p>
<p>The problem both sides have is that they will never come to agree on a price to pay for those patents. Apples mistake currently was trying to get a judge to decide the matter but at the same time declare they won&#8217;t abide by it unless they like the outcome.</p>
<p>It was a shitty and ultimately stupid move on their part to play the courts like that.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t join a patent pool for industry standards and then charge arbitrarily based on you liking the other company or not.</p>
<p>Then when the other refuses your ridiculous demands you go on to ban their products.</p>
<p>Industry standards critical for interoperability  cannot be at the mercy of this.</p>
<blockquote>You can’t join a patent pool for industry standards and then charge arbitrarily based on you liking the other company or not.</blockquote>
<p>Who is doing that? Is there any sentence saying that any company is charging non FRAND?</p>
<p>While Apple was asking Samsung to pay $30 pet phone made by Samsung to license its patents, all the while asking the courts to make Motorola charge Apple no more than $1 per device.  I know it&#8217;s FRAND vs Trade patents, but asking $30 all the while trying to force your competitor to accept $1 is ridiculous.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the really the difference between FRAND and others patents.</p>
<p>Btw, Motorola initially demanded 2.25% of the iPhone unsubsidised sale price, which is around $30 too.</p>
<p>&#8220;but it could conceivably draw in Google&#8217;s operating <strong>system</strong> itself in a way that hasn&#8217;t yet happened in Apple and Samsung&#8217;s battles.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is straight up pathetic, even more so than the whole apology thing, Google has made numerous workarounds to avoid Apple&#8217;s patents and make their stock OS their own. To me it seems Apple is just trying to grab on to some extra excuses to have their way. Pathetic.</p>
<p>This</p>
<p>Its funny how they are only suing updates to Jelly Bean up until September of this year. Funny they are not suing updates October and on when the Asus made Nexus 4 came out.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it obvious? They&#8217;re suing Samsung, not Asus</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the point, they have a personal vendetta against Samsung, just because they are the biggest competitor to them.  They don&#8217;t go after Asus who makes a pure stock Jellybean device with the same exact software as the Galaxy Nexus in both the Nexus 7, and also LG who also have the same stock Jelly Bean OS in the Nexus 4.  They also may not wasn&#8217;t to fight the other OEMs at the same tome, in other words divide and conquer and not fight them all together collectively, or avoid a huge fight with Google directly.</p>
<p>The vendetta is fully justified since no other company copied so much from Apple and to make matters worse Apple were paying them billions as suppliers.</p>
<p>So the best they can come up with is target a device that runs zero samsung software?</p>
<blockquote>In particular, Apple seeks to add infringement charts to include the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 device.</blockquote>
<p>The Samsung Note 10.1 runs a lot more Samsung software than &#8220;zero&#8221;.  The Galaxy Nexus had already found to be infringing, so it&#8217;s not really new in this case.</p>
<p>Interesting they&#8217;d try the Note when they lost on all counts in the last trial when it came to the Galaxy Tab. Especially considering the Note is even less like the iPad.</p>
<p>Yes, and there was already an initial judgement against Samsung for a separate patent trial. So when is enough enough???</p>
<p>Samsung being a supplier is not relevant to the argument. Apple simply has to find a new supplier or become their own supplier.</p>
<p>What you call a &#8220;personal vendetta&#8221; others, less emotionally invested in a global corporation, would call &#8220;business&#8221;.</p>
<p>I mean Nexus 7, but also they are not going after LG who make the Nexus 4, released in October.</p>
<p>Announced last week.  To be released next week.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous now, Apple has to understand that we have to all share innovation in this stage of the game now. Obviously not going overboard and taking whole ideas of a OS, but little things like &#8220;Pinch to zoom&#8221; and &#8220;auto correct&#8221;.  Either way we should remember what Steve Jobs said &quot; I will destroy Android , its a stolen product. I&#8217;m going to go thermonuclear on this&quot; oh Steve, we should all share each others ideas once in a while.</p>
<p>Samsung is not sharing, why should Apple give them anything?</p>
<p>Samsung sued Apple&#8217;s iPhone 5 so of course Apple had to sue Samsung back: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3441914/samsung-apple-iphone-5-lawsuit" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3441914/samsung-apple-iphone-5-lawsuit</a></p>
<p>Apple sued first.. This Lawsuit has been in the making since the last one. The iPhone 5 came out after that.</p>
<p>Wait until George Lucas updates it &#8211; then Greedo will sue first &#8220;as was always my intention&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple sued first and won, at least for now &#8211;  I&#8217;m sure we all remember.</p>
<p>Samsung could easily have accepted it there or just appeal that case by itself, but no&#8230; they went straight for  revenge by suing quite publicly the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Now of course they get sued back, again.</p>
<p>Noooope try again. <br />
Apple filed two lawsuits against Samsung. You mentioned the first that went to trial and Apple won. They then filed a second lawsuit against a bunch of newer devices that weren&#8217;t included in the previous trial in late August. <br />
 The iPhone 5 was released a month later.  This article relates to that second lawsuit that Apple filed. <br />
 So Apple haven&#8217;t sued back at all. Samsung sued Apple back for their first two suits. <br />
 Please pay more attention if you&#8217;re going to comment about this stuff.</p>
<p>Please read this very article!</p>
<blockquote>during a hearing at which Samsung was also scheduled to explain why it should be allowed to include the iPhone 5 in its own countersuit against Cupertino.</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for supporting my point. <br />
Quote: &#8220;Countersuit against Cupertino (AKA. Apple)&#8221;. <br />
I&#8217;m glad we can finally agree on something.</p>
<p>From the article you linked (first paragraph actually&#8230;)<br />
<blockquote>Samsung has asked Judge Paul Grewal to allow it to include the iPhone 5 in the company&#8217;s latest <strong>countersuit</strong> against Apple.</blockquote></p>
<p>Ah yes. You made the classic mistake that people often make. You assumed that metalfx actually read what he had posted. Absolutely no guarantee of that unfortunately.</p>
<p>Wow really, you don&#8217;t say&#8230;</p>
<p>This is the exactly the response to that move by Samsung.</p>
<p>Your a fool, samsung and apple is a different story, im talking about the android OS.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re the fool then since this case is specifically against Samsung.</p>
<p>Just stop metalfx. In this case the facts win, not your alternate reality&#8230;.or is it opposite day?</p>
<p>then why throw Jellybean on there?</p>
<p>Because Apple wants to add the Note 10.1 to the lawsuit and that now runs Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Plus the Galaxy Nexus from the previous case where Apple won now has been updated to Jelly Bean too.</p>
<p>I still dont see how Jellybean infringes on anything that Apple has popularized and/or integrated into there system, believe me I try real hard to be as less one sided as possible, but Apple isnt really helping itself with these lawsuits&#8230;.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Apple are just trying to make money where they can.</p>
<p>If Apple really believe that Jelly Bean infringes on iOS technology, then they should man up and sue Google. Wimps.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t because Google gives Android away for free basically.  It&#8217;s open source software, Google can wipe it&#8217;s hands clean of this.  I might be wrong, but I don&#8217;t think you can sue them for a free product.  They are dastardly evil and diabolically brilliant when they bought the AOSP and now gave it to the world of device makers to try to ruin Apple.</p>
<p>why ruin? they brought an alternative. ruin is up to apple, they can either rest or invent. i dont see how its so bad to have several competitors out there and as a customer i dont care who takes from whom, its pretty obvious they all have taken inspiration from each other, as it should be.</p>
<p>Oracle v Google.</p>
<blockquote>They can’t because Google gives Android away for free basically.</blockquote>
<p>So, why Oracle sued them? Perhaps is because your reason doesn&#8217;t hold?</p>
<p>Even if for the sake of argument Google can&#8217;t be sued, isn&#8217;t it about time they rallied and stepped in?  The Jellybean argument is now about the OS&#8230; if Apple were to win, wouldn&#8217;t that mean all the other OEMs would back off from using Jellybean?  So then what?  Many consumers not getting the &#8216;latest and greatest&#8217; will think the devices are outdated and not buy them.  The fight was against Sammie, but the Jellybean argument is now a threat to all OEMs.</p>
<p>God&#8230;this just needs to stop. I enjoy using Apple products very much but there&#8217;s just no excuse for this behavior. Completely freaking outrageous&#8230;.I grew weary from just reading the title.</p>
<p>For fuck&#8217;s sake&#8230;</p>
<p>OH GOD APPLE PLEASE STOP.  I love you so please STOP already.  Don&#8217;t make me hate, don&#8217;t do it&#8230;..</p>
<p>Apple can&#8217;t stop with Samsung/Motorola/etc suing them back can they..  It would be like stopping in a pool full of hungry sharks to see if they would just let you go.</p>
<p>They either all agree on a settlement or this has to continue.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#8217;t stop regardless.</p>
<p>Apple inc., as any life creature, has its destiny, its nature, if you will. Most obviously it wont change itself on a bit in a future. I wish you&#8217;ll make the right desicion soon, and start enjoying common and shared to each other technologies. Apple going to go into the history as an arogant and selfish company.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t Apple be suing Google? Or all the manufacturers that use Android?</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em &#8230;. Sue &#8217;em!</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m on 4.2 so I guess I&#8217;m safe.</p>
<p>Nexus 7? Nexus 10?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/ipad-mini-display-quality-falls-short-of-android-rivals-according-to-tests-1110550" target="_blank">http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/ipad-mini-display-quality-falls-short-of-android-rivals-according-to-tests-1110550</a></p>
<p>The test seem to confirm what most folks already suspected. Amazon and Google have packed better screens into smaller tablets at a lower price, yet it&#8217;s Apple that is continually talking about other companies making &#8220;compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried reading that PDF from Apple but the legal jargons make my head spin.<br />
Will someone be so kind to point out exactly what feature/function of the Galaxy Nexus and Jelly Bean violates Apple&#8217;s patents?<br />
It&#8217;s blatantly obvious with the Galaxy S and SII but Galaxy Nexus??</p>
<p>wah, they can sue Samsung for using Google&#8217;s operating system without Google being sued. &#8220;Magical&#8221; &#8220;brilliant&#8221;<br />
what is the difference between the Jelly Beam on this one and on the other?</p>
<p>Apple can&#8217;t stand getting shafted!!</p>
<p><img src="http://adland.tv/files/imagecache/storyimage/apple-store-china_0.jpg" /></p>
<p>LOL wanna bet which side of the store is more profitable?</p>
<p>Why are you a shareholder? I love when Apple fans bang on about how much profit Apple is making off of them by ripping them off, unless you&#8217;re a shareholder then you want to be able to get you&#8217;re device as cheap as possible! It&#8217;s not something to be proud of at how much Apple riped you off for an iClone 5.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t Samsung fans like when Samsung turns their billions in profit? They sure appear to around here, especially when they mention sales numbers. Otherwise why do  fans care about shipped number anyway, do they get a commission on every sale?</p>
<p>In reality profits are a good sign. It&#8217;s better to be on a platform that makes profits than being tied to a company struggling to make ends meet like RIM and now HTC.</p>
<p>When that company updates their products, even older things, it&#8217;s even better!</p>
<p>All I care about as a consumer is &#8220;Am I getting ripped off?&#8221;. Paying that much for an iPhone I say yes. To me market-share is more important then how much profit a company is making off of me.</p>
<p>That is only your opinion. Looking at Samsung&#8217;s profits of $7.2B last quarter they don&#8217;t seem to be doing too bad &#8220;ripping off&#8221; (in your sense) their own customers either, all that plastic they use for their phones must be helping their bottom line. It is a lot cheaper than metal after all.</p>
<p>But they don&#8217;t bump their prices to get a silly profit margin or hold back hardware so they can use the better hardware for it next year to make you pay for it again. Look at the iPad Mini, Next year it will be the same thing but a bit lighter a little bit more horsepower and of course Apple&#8217;s fab &#8220;Retina Display&#8221; and guess what? All for the same price as the current one is now. They are so predictable, they could of gave you what they will give you next year for the same price today!! Except Apple want the highest profit margin out of you as possible and also to get you buy into that profit margin again next year! And this is what I see as a rip-off. Come on, tell me the Nexus 4 or 7 is a rip-off? Tell me the Nexus 10 is a rip off? I don&#8217;t buy pure Samsung devices, I buy Nexus because I&#8217;m smart. Samsung have nowhere near as much profit margin as Apple and you know it.</p>
<p>Ah the good old plastic line.</p>
<p>You know, the one thing that makes me not want to buy a Nexus 4 is that it&#8217;s back is made of glass and not plastic.</p>
<p>Ever heard of elasticity&#8230;they have a huge range of products..</p>
<p>Why, yes I am. I send a sincere thank you too all those people who overpaid for their electronics.</p>
<p>Wallpaper?</p>
<p>There should be a story thread in The Verge called &#8216;Apple vs. the World&#8217;. :P</p>
<p>Frivolous.  So friggin&#8217;  frivolous. The gates of hell probably sports a big &#8217;ol Apple logo.</p>
<p>What is apple trying to accomplish here?  These lawsuits are not going to stop android, that&#8217;s been proven over the last couple of years.  Why keep wasting everyone&#8217;s time?</p>
<p>I foresee a future in America where the only smartphone you can have is an iPhone.</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<p>As much as I really like the iPhone as I&#8217;m a proud owner of one, even I don&#8217;t want to see a future like that.</p>
<p>There will always be a place for people to have options in my book.</p>
<p>And the only place you can eat is Taco Bell.</p>
<p>¡Las 3 conchas!</p>
<p>Dear Mr Apple,</p>
<p>Just Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop STOP!</p>
<p>Go back to the lab and produce innovative software&#8230; iOS is so old the skeomorphist wall paper is metaphorically peeling off. Make the curve looking forward rather than following it looking over your shoulder.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>A non-apple consumer wanting innovation in the market place.</p>
<p>I think one of the writers here referred to iOS6 as &#8220;Scott Forstall&#8217;s twisted fantasty&#8221; &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t agree more!</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new?</p>
<p>Currently every major hardware and software creator is guilty of some form of imitation. What annoys me is that increasingly all those companies are choosing to invest significant portions of their budget into patents, lawyers and litigation.</p>
<p>What annoys me even more than that, is when a company goes crying to the courts but then acts like a petulant school child when things don&#8217;t go their way (ala Apple and the UK legal system).</p>
<p>Oh Give me a Fucking Break!! -Apple</p>
<p>I ran out of popcorn</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple hopes&#8230;&#8221; they should better pray for the own future! I hope google makes a point.</p>
<p>These companies are being childish.<br />
Cut the crap already, and grow up. And Samsung, please stop dragging down Android.</p>
<p>Samsung have made Android relevant. No one has done more to make Android a dominant force that they have.</p>
<p>Not saying that they&#8217;ve always been &#8220;right&#8221; in how they&#8217;ve achieved that, but Android would not be where it is without Samsung.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m dense and just missed it in the article but what is Jellybean infringing upon?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re probably arguing that 4.1 contains the same features as previous versions and is therefore included. So you&#8217;d look at the original suit.</p>
<p>How on earth do people get so worked up about the business practices of two multinational corporations? Good grief.</p>
<p>Seriously apple? You have got to fucking chill. This has got to be one of the reason why supervillains are born.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to love when people start buying nexus phones   due to the price without contract ($299-349.99) and see in increase of people switching to it because it&#8217;s a easier choice to get and not a bad one at all. Then you will get company&#8217;s having to drop their prices because of it if they want to maintain selling their overpriced phones (Apple). Get em where it hurts in their pockets!</p>
<p>More rubbish from Apple.  Clearly still running scared after realising their competition is better than them.</p>
<p>Seriously, I hate to sound like a troll&#8230; but wow.  Maybe if Apple started making innovative products again (original iPad? iPhone 4?) everyone else would be free to innovate without the threat of legal action.</p>
<p>I hate the way apple does &#8220;business&#8221;.  If Henry Ford used apple&#8217;s mentality, he would have sued all other car makers for having 4 wheels, and a steering wheel.</p>
<p>Innovation doesn&#8217;t happen without copying! How far is it going to go? Why didn&#8217;t the first cellphone maker to use a touch screen sue apple for putting a touch screen in it&#8217;s first iphone? because it is ludicrous. What apple is doing is appalling, and should not be allowed.</p>
<p>My friend is a law professor so I for one am glad for all these lawsuits.  Who else will keep all these young lawyers employed?</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t they sue everybody else that uses Jelly Bean? Or just sue Google. Why only their biggest competitor?</p>
<p>Let me get my popcorn out.</p>
<p>Take this anecdotal info for what you will, but a few observations:</p>
<p>- I personally  know about 6 or 7 people who owned iPhone 3GS , 4, and 4S, who have switched to Android since the iPhone 5 launch.  Among them were the GS3, the Note 2, a used Rezound, and a RAZR MAXX.   I asked why the 4 user (who is totally not tech inclined) why she got the GS3 and her reason was that she &#8220;wanted a better phone&#8221;.  I think it was the screen/camera.<br />
- Only one friend switched from a Gnex LTE to the iPhone 5, because he didnt use/need all of Android&#8217;s  features and wanted something simple for calls/text/web and said that it was</p>
<p>My nephew is his selling his iPad to get a Nexus 7 and a phone upgrade on Sprint, having owned the EVO at launch and briefly an EVO 3D.</p>
<p>All over Facebook, my non-Verge reading family and friends are openly mocking Apple.<br />
I myself have owned at least 6 Android phones, two Android tablets, and decided to give the iPad and  4S a fair shake, and having come from Android where I can customize so much, the iPhone and iPad felt boring to me, and I sold them within a few moFor me, I think Im justb</p>
<p>Apple is sueing itself into being one of the most loathed companies of all time. Yes they make quality products but they are getting out of touch. These suits cost millions of dollars and creates lots of negativity. Instead apple needs to focus on maintaining a good relationship with it&#8217;s existing customers. Instead of lawsuits apple, how bout a customer loyalty program that at the very least gives repeat apple customers credit at the itunes store or discounts on their products which cost a lot more then competing products.</p>
<p>The only reason they don&#8217;t is tht they are making tons of money doing it. They just want more money. It&#8217;s called Greed. And Apple has a lot of it.</p>
<p>A damn shame.</p>
<p>lies, damn lies, and statistics&#8230;.</p>
<p>Finally (slowly) riding the world of some of the crappy Gingerbread Phones.</p>
<p>Whenever I see gingerbread on a phone, I die a little inside for the people using them.</p>
<p>Yep, knowing that some won&#8217;t give a high end Android phone a chance.</p>
<p>High end Android phone will be the same after couple months.</p>
<p>Nexus</p>
<p>or WP8. Nexus 4 has no LTE and bad battery life.</p>
<p>Has LTE in Canada and the battery life is actually quite good. How is that Skype bootloop treatin ya?</p>
<p>With LTE in Canada it would be even worst. It&#8217;s already bad without LTE. GSMARENA already did the battery test.</p>
<p>What Skype boot loop?</p>
<p>Agreed.  What &#8220;Skype boot loop?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://mobilesyrup.com/2013/01/03/skype-preview-for-windows-phone-8-gets-version-bump-loss-of-functionality-as-it-attempts-to-fix-stability-issues/" target="_blank">http://mobilesyrup.com/2013/01/03/skype-preview-for-windows-phone-8-gets-version-bump-loss-of-functionality-as-it-attempts-to-fix-stability-issues/</a></p>
<p>They, admittedly solved it now. That was a childish dig. My bad. I like to think the quality of my comments are above that for the most part.</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 has LTE.</p>
<p>Admittedly it&#8217;s for a network that doesn&#8217;t exist yet, namely, T-mobile&#8217;s future LTE network. But that just means it will have LTE next year.</p>
<p>This year.  2013.</p>
<p>you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about concerning battery life.  the difference between 3G and lte/hspa+ incredibly noticeable, the difference between lte and hspa+ hardly noticeable.    I doubt most would notice.</p>
<p>I doubt that considering HSPA+ is closer to 3g technology than LTE is.</p>
<p>Bad battery life? Is that what we call 10 hours of run time now?</p>
<p>10 hours, hell.  I just got 28 hours off of a charge with almost 3 hours screen time.  50% HSPA, 50% WiFi.</p>
<p>Franco kernel tho &#8211; otherwise stock, rooted.  I got less battery life stock but still awesome.</p>
<p>Not really. ICS and above on decent hardware will always be responsive as the day it was purchased even without an upgrade. Yes, it will be annoying not to have the latest and greatest, but if its fast when you buy it, its actually a risk to upgrade the software to a version that may reduce the user memory (and slow down the phone).</p>
<p>Crappy hardware and user-unfriendly 2.x versions of Android will always feel slow.</p>
<p>My VZW Galaxy Nexus is holding up fine, its all about the software on them. Moto&#8217;s may still put an overlay but the phone runs like a charm, got my Dad a RAZR M for Christmas and his phone just won&#8217;t die, and yet still runs like a charm.</p>
<p>Most people do not care if their phone is high-end or low end. If it works, they&#8217;re happy.</p>
<p>The problem is most low end phones run like crap.</p>
<p>and ICS 4.0 is on 29.1% of all devices, making gingerbread less than 50% now.</p>
<p>I die a little inside too.</p>
<blockquote>Whenever I see gingerbread on a phone, I die a little inside for the people using them.</blockquote>
<p>Upgrading my wife&#8217;s SGSII from 2.3 to 4.0, I took major flak for screwing up her phone as it caused her docomo mail app to go on the fritz. So it&#8217;s not all roses you know&#8230;</p>
<p>Could be worse.  When I upgraded my SGSII, I got stuck in a loop with apps crashing at startup until the phone gives up and reboots.  I had to wipe it to get it working again.  So, now I backup my data before I do major OS upgrades, which is sadly not as easy on Android as it ought to be.,</p>
<p>Sounds like updating old school macs software,  pre osx.</p>
<p>And then I think about how many times I recommended it back then.</p>
<p>Ridding?</p>
<p>My direct boss has a Captivate stuck on GB with no way to update (no computer can &#8216;see&#8217; the phone.) I know a pay raise is waiting for me if I can get it working&#8230;.perhaps I need a jig =/ Not of the musical kind</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t tried this, as I don&#8217;t have a captivate, but I decided to google your problem and found this thread that may be helpful for gaining root on the device. Once you have that, upgrading should be a lot easier. <a href="http://androidforums.com/captivate-all-things-root/147711-root-captivate-no-usb-cables-easy.html" target="_blank">http://androidforums.com/captivate-all-things-root/147711-root-captivate-no-usb-cables-easy.html</a></p>
<p>won&#8217;t work..the Cappie on GB has a 3e recovery. On Froyo it was possible because the 2e recovery didn&#8217;t check signature verification.</p>
<p>Hey thanks for looking into it. I find my lack of Googling disturbing =/<br />
as Pressuredrop said 3e recovery checks will prevent it, though the thread you provided has a user linking to a modded version. I&#8217;m going to lend him my old Vibrant while I tinker with his Captivate. If I get this working I&#8217;m buying you a beer. Or a Nexus 4 depending on the raise I get :D</p>
<p>EDIT *as &#8216;greatestNiothing&#8217; said</p>
<p>Progress!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nice, I think a lot of devices will start being replaced around this time as 2 years time expires. Hopefully old OSs will go away soon.</p>
<p>Still not in my S3 because stupid carrier and warranty.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for gingerbread to be gone. Although with Froyo, Ecalir and  Donut still holding onto 11.6% it may take awhile. Anything before ICS represents Android in it&#8217;s awkward youth stages(IMO). You just cringe everytime you see a picture of it&#8217;s zity face, huge hands, and mouthful of braces grin. Don&#8217;t worry though, he grew up just fine.</p>
<p><img src="http://memecrunch.com/meme/DJQV/ics/image.png" /></p>
<p>You just won the internet!</p>
<p>Lots of crappy GB phones still being sold everywhere, so it will be a long time still for GB. But the market that buys apps buys the high end phones, so this will help improve apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;juggernaut Samsung has been pushing Jelly Bean to its flagship phones&#8221;<br />
I know many people with an S2 and none of them have ICS yet, even though I&#8217;ve told them to upgrade. Gingerbread is gonna be alive for a loooong time!</p>
<p>My old Sprint GS2 has had ICS for awhile. Cannot speak to the other variants.</p>
<p>I think what he was getting at is that the update is available, they just haven&#8217;t done it yet. I think this is a common problem with a lot of Android users who come from feature phones and are used to buying and using a phone &#8220;as-is&#8221; for the extent of their contract. There&#8217;s also probably a bit of &#8220;update anxiety&#8221; among a large portion of the public that are worried about change or problems.</p>
<p>True. I know a lot of people who aren&#8217;t into tech like we are that just dismiss update notifications when they pop up. The average person doesn&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>And its no different with Apple users. E.g., I was not upgrading my ipads to ios6 until they got the youtube apps. People just assume that all apple users are on the latest version, but Apple never publishes any data about it. If anything, upgrading tends to be more complicated for ios and may involve itunes if you dont have a few spare gigs on your device. and itunes is usually an ordeal of a few hours where it first slowly backs up all the movies and other crap and then fails the upgrade a couple of times before you are free to move on with your life.</p>
<p>So the iPad mini event in October where they announce that 200 million devices were running ios6 after 1 month is apple not announcing figures?</p>
<p>Apples and oranges.  Can&#8217;t compare a unified hardware/software company to Android.  Yes &#8211; they get impressive update speeds, but so does the Nexus.</p>
<p>I agree with you. I was just pointing out that apple does talk about adoption of iOS.</p>
<p>The s2 has had ICS for quite a while.  Tell your friends to update their phones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s progress but this is a interesting caveat.</p>
<blockquote> Android devices that recently accessed Google Play </blockquote>
<p>Is that new or something? Isn&#8217;t that bit you quoted always the case when Google updates these stats?</p>
<p>Pretty much all phone that are being used.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be surprised, there is an alarming amount of people that just use the apps on the phone once they&#8217;ve downloaded their copy of Angry Birds.</p>
<p>That makes no sense.  You&#8217;re always signed into the Play Store; how do you think the apps get update notifications?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how these charts are always made. It just means it doesn&#8217;t count any Android device that doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;Google certification&#8221;, like the Amazon tablets. Unless, i guess, people root them and side load the store.</p>
<p>Ya but the Fire is barely android with the way Amazon forked it. It makes sense for that to be treated as a separate product.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still Android, just not Google controlled Android.</p>
<p>At its core yes but it is so different that I wouldn&#8217;t consider it to be. it is a content machine that is locked down. As far as I am concerned, that is not android.</p>
<p>On top of that, google doesn&#8217;t &#8220;control&#8221; android. If you want, you can replace every google service on the device. Google doesn&#8217;t stop you from doing that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m aware. But you won&#8217;t get access to the Google goodies if you do that. Which is why I refer to the majority of Android as Google controlled.</p>
<p>I see your point. I just don&#8217;t think the wording makes sense. It is more so &#8220;those who CHOOSE to be in the google ecosystem&#8221;. Using gmail, search, play, youtube, talk, plus, voice is a choice. You can use any one of them or none at all if you want.</p>
<p>Youtube:  Vimeo, Dailymotion, Break<br />
Gmail: Outlook, Yahoo Mail, Exchange<br />
Talk: Whatsapp, kakao, Kik, Facebook Messenger, Chaton, Skype.<br />
Search: Bing, Duckduckgo<br />
Plus: Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare<br />
Voice: This one is difficult to replace but can be done to some degree with Skype.</p>
<p>You can&#8217; t do any of this on Amazon devices along with the fact that they closed the code which is why I say it has no business in these numbers.</p>
<p>Scratch my last comment. The Fires source has been released.</p>
<p>Not as interesting as you make it, it just means that they didn&#8217;t count devices that have been turned off for the past month(android devices does access google play in the background as well, if it was ever used with google play). And obviously they have no way of getting numbers on people not accessing the play store..</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with that? I have a Nexus One sitting in a drawer that was replaced by my Galaxy Nexus a year ago. I would hope this isn&#8217;t counted but, now that I think of it, I did turn it on and update some apps recently, so it&#8217;s probably in there.</p>
<p>I remember the older charts actually say &#8220;within 2 week time frame&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason why older devices are not showed up on this chart is because of the lack of dev support for older platforms. Hence, older phone access Google Play less but that doesn&#8217;t mean the real world usage is low.</p>
<p>If Google wants to prove exactly how it looks like out there, just the Gmail sync clients&#8230;</p>
<p>The charts are still based off of a 2 week time frame, its just cutoff on the image the Verge used. The Droid-Life link has the full image.</p>
<p>They make these charts for developers, if people with eclair aren&#8217;t downloading apps, it makes sense to ignore them</p>
<p>Not everyone download apps / access store every 2 weeks, and new phones gets there often to download essential apps. It&#8217;s a distorted image that Google is trying to convince developers to move on with the latest SDK.</p>
<p>The same will soon happen to WP7 as well&#8230; unfortunately.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but the Play Store app regularly connects to look for app updates.  I think that happens at least daily.  So, even if you never use the app itself, it could still be reporting in to Google regularly.</p>
<p>And whats wrong with doing that? The people who are getting left out aren&#8217;t contributing to sales. This is a chart of people who are looking for apps. Thats significantly more useful information than the distribution of users. While I&#8217;m sure this metric is pretty close to the actual handset distribution, it would be bad for developers if it included a bunch of users who exist, but don&#8217;t download anything.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really what&#8217;s happening here though. If your Android phone could connect to the Play Store in the two week window of this survey, it did. The Play Store is constantly connecting to check for updates. Assuming your device is on, has an internet connection, and has the Play Store, it is in this statistic.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people will simply never update due to carrier fuckarounds&#8230; and Kies&#8230;.</p>
<p>I understand Google&#8217;s desire for openness but they need to create some restriction on oem and carriers. They need to inform them not to modify Android so much that it prevents timely updates. All Android devices should have a min standard that allows rapid updates. This is why I only buy Android phones from the Play Store.</p>
<p>A major reason Android is successful is because its openness gives carriers more control &#8211; I don&#8217;t think creating restrictions like WP8 and iOS would help Google.</p>
<p>But this is creating an inconsistent and bad customer experience.</p>
<p>Only for the techie who is always looking for the latest and greatest. If you want this, get a Nexus which is guaranteed supported for two years with updates.</p>
<p>People keep pointing to windows phone but lets not forget what just happened to all the windows phone 7 users who, unlike the gingerbread owners, have zero chance of an upgrade.</p>
<p>Not really. Most people buy the phone because it has features that they like. It will never lose those features, and they will keep liking it. If you need to get upgrades, by now you know you need to buy a Nexus. Its a feature like a big screen or a keyboard.</p>
<p>Sounds like a WP8</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And we all know the success that&#8217;s been both in user experience and sales&#8230;</p>
<p>Yea, they are usually some of the highest rated phones in customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>What made gingerbread adoption so much higher than newer versions?</p>
<p>Likely reluctance of the OEM&#8217;s to port ics+ to their existing and new devices, when they had  working GB sources(ics brought MANY changes)</p>
<p>Relatively minor update from Eclaire &#8211; Froyo. Most phones that launched with either were eventually updated to gingerbread. This includes The original Droids and most of the first  Galaxy S devices which were all very popular. (and many of which continue to be used today, apparently)</p>
<p>Android development shifted to Honeycomb (which was tablet only) and the phone industry continued to churn out GB devices.</p>
<p>True, I was still using my original Galaxy s up until Xmas lol, had it updated to cyanogen mod 10 though.</p>
<p>I think GB was around the time when Android devices really took off. Even more than when the OG Droid was released.</p>
<p>OG Droid which was evetually updated to GB, which can be counted amound those 2.3 devices. In fact Droid 2, 3 and 4 are all still on GB, huh?</p>
<p>Wait NVM, looks like original Droid stopped at Froyo, officially.</p>
<p>Droid 4? WTF. Just ignore me, I&#8217;m spreading rumors, apparently.</p>
<p>Everything before the Droid 4 is stuck on Gingerbread. I&#8217;d have to double check Droid OG, but the 2 is. I have a retired 2 Global &amp; 3 in my desk on gingerbread. The 4 is on ics.</p>
<p>Think of ICS as the WP8 of Android world. Some upgraded the Gingerbread devices anyway, but others didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Ace &amp; S.</p>
<p>According to the graph, the number of Jelly Bean devices that recently accessed the Play Store, was the same as Android 2.2, or Froyo. That&#8217;s Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>Damn you, Samsung Vibrant!!</p>
<p>&#8230; and Motorola Droid!</p>
<p>Not really, its a normal distribution, one trending upward, one trending downward.</p>
<p>I meant the numbers as they stand currently, relative to the current state of Android, and in the overall time scheme of updates and release history. I also wonder how the iOS adoption rates compare, in terms of the very early versions.</p>
<p>How far was ICS penetration after six months?</p>
<p>Never mind, I somehow missed the line in the article that states the Jelly Bean adoption rate is quicker than ICS.</p>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t surprising as Jellybean was a fairly minor update comparatively.</p>
<p>Cosmetically, you&#8217;re correct, but for everything else, JB was a major upgrade.</p>
<p>10mm</p>
<p>UP TO MY ARM<br />
<img src="http://static4.fjcdn.com/comments/OH+Hey+look+Insanity+Wolf+s+Flesh+Light+_cc4bf8406ebbb07d5dc9237521c67d1a.jpg" /></p>
<p>So on more than 50 Million devices which is a nice number. People shouldn&#8217;t forget that there are millions of old devices acound which will never be capable of running ICS or later because it would slow it down a lot or doesn&#8217;t have enough space.</p>
<p>Sucks for the saps stuck on GB or below. At this point, though, I would think a lot of these people are nearing the end of their contracts or have passed it, so I feel like a lot of people don&#8217;t upgrade by choice.</p>
<p>Jellybean makes ios stale as a glaze donuts at Walmart</p>
<p>I upgraded my mother from an on-contract HTC Wildfire (Android 2.2) to an off contract Nexus 4 (4.2). She&#8217;s saving $25 a month and even though she was initially apathetic toward the upgrade, now I can&#8217;t remove the phone from her hand.</p>
<p>Many consumers are not aware of how bad their current user experience is.</p>
<p>Bought my wife a N4..she gave up on it after 15 minutes and picked up her GS2.</p>
<p>GS2 is a good phone though. The Wildfire is a piece of junk but my  mother was still wary of change.</p>
<p>Just goes to show you may not prefer iOS, but Apple made some very smart decisions when they architected their platform!</p>
<p>Android has some pros, but it sure is a messy platform in many respects.</p>
<p>Most consumers don&#8217;t care about having the latest update, so I don&#8217;t think this is as big a deal as its made out to be.</p>
<p>I agree about consumers, but that doesn&#8217;t negate the fact that they are missing out on new features, capabilities, security fixes, bug fixes, more robust apps, and so on whether they know it or not!</p>
<p>It also hurts the platform because devs have to cater to the lowest common denominator!</p>
<p>sure but what can you do. a manufacturer sells phones, a carrier sells subsidized contracts. when the very corporations that get hurt by updates, making old phones last longer, get to pull the levers you can bet what the outcome will be. they skin in order to keep android out of the equation. android has 4 relevant devices, gnex, 4, 7 and 10. the rest is pretty much hangbait.</p>
<p>You can do exactly what Apple did and keep the control! Hence the iOS platform doesn&#8217;t have these issues.</p>
<p>Apple architected the iDevices, the iOS platform, and their business model for the best experience for end users and consumers. Google architected the Android platform to get as much market penetration as possible as fast as possible! Huge difference in the outcomes those two approaches yield.</p>
<p>locking an os has downsides, too you know. i would miss the creative impulse that a thriving community brings for one. a close circle where outside influences are shut off can hurt as well and that&#8217;s what is happening right now as you see good old ios getting long in the teeth. the developers sitting on that are old now, they are out of ideas, they have no clue whats going on. months ago they still thought paper-shredders were the cool new thing that everyone needs. meanwhile android brought more important stuff in a minor revision than its counterpart did in two full years. and thats the main difference, open source is not limited to constraints. open source can be abused, sure, but when it works its more of a movement than anything.</p>
<p>I am not denying that both approaches have pros and cons, but I think overall from a macro perspective the better choice for a seamless experience and the average user is the way Apple went.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think iOS devs are out of ideas at all. In fact devs are leading innovation in many ways on the platform, and all of the new or innovative apps come to iOS first still. Why? Because it is a better environment for devs in many ways. So one could argue that Apple was even more forward looking than Google because they didn&#8217;t simply leverage the open source community (and all of the baggage and issues that come with that and the way they implemented their platform), but they leveraged devs to push innovation on their platform and architected it in a way that is actually hospitable to them and where they can actually make money!</p>
<p>Your one point about a paper shredder can be attributed to one man, Scott Forstall, who is now fired from Apple. I don&#8217;t think that shows iOS is desperate to catch up at all. Yes there are features iOS can add that Android has already implemented, but Android has fundamental implementations in their architecture that can never be fully fixed because they are inherent to the way the entire ecosystem in architected. That to me is a MUCH bigger problem!</p>
<p>i was talking about ios developers, though. i fully agree, ios is the better plattform and has a better eco system and more developers are building for it. but the people that are actually working on ios, they are grampy&#8217;s now, in their 70s. they have no clue in hell how to make a modern os. and thats probably the reason the eco system thing is changing as other systems gain traction and markets quickly.</p>
<p>I hear what you are saying, but have you ever met the whole iOS team lol? How do you know they are all old &#8220;grampys&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are a bunch of young, bright people on the team that are wicket smart. I mean I haven&#8217;t met them either, but I would venture to say there is a mix and depth of talent. Scott Forstall, like him or not, was a young guy for having been in such a high position! He is also extremely smart even if his design taste is not the best and he is a total jerk.</p>
<p>I think something to take into account is that with a platform that huge and successful even Apple has to be careful about making huge changes. Historically Apple is less afraid than any company to take risky moves like that. But you have to preserve the empire to some extent as well!</p>
<p>I mean just look at how they were crucified for the lightning connector. They used the dock connector for a DECADE, might as well be 100 years in tech time, as long as they could before not being able to go further and needing to be more compact etc. I mean I understand that it was a big shift for the ecosystem built around the dock connector but it had to happen eventually and I think they waited as long as they could. I do not think it was just about money.</p>
<p>Point is they have to walk a fine line. But I do not think Apple is done innovating at all!</p>
<p>Make us proud with iOS 7 and OS X 10.9 Jony :)</p>
<p>STILL no easy HTC One X Jelly Bean update.</p>
<p>Explain easy?</p>
<p>this is what happens when manufacturers and carriers get in the way of progress</p>
<p>good to see it growing however</p>
<p>There are likely now (or within the next month) more devices running Android 4.0+ than the total number of devices running all versions of iOS.</p>
<p>iOS is on roughly 500 million devices. Is Android on 2 billion yet? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>My last phone was a Galaxy S and it doesnt have an OTA gingerbread update, you have to manually download it and install via computer. It is not even 2 years old.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running on Froyo&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p>Flash an updated ROM, quick! Follow me to the internet!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to have some sticky shoes.</p>
<p>Im on a htc desire HD (inspire 4g) running Jb  better than GB with sens&#8230; Google should support developers pushing  ICS and above to &#8220;legacy&#8221; devices.</p>
<p>Frankly, calling 4.2 JB as well is the most confusing thing Google has ever done. For one thing it&#8217;s nothing like 4.1, maybe other than Project Butter there was more change from 4.1 to 4.2 than from 4.0 to 4.1. All I can guess is that they tried not to look like they have made a half-baked effort for 4.1.</p>
<p>Wow&#8230; 10%&#8230; And I&#8217;m sure Key Lime Pie is right around the corner&#8230; Lol</p>
<p><strong>Sigh</strong></p>
<p>Root your phones boys and gals</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder if it would benefit Google to try to force OEMs hands with timely updates by threatening to pull Google Services (which are not open source) from Android devices that are not updated to the newest OS within a specific timeframe.  They could also do themselves a favor and set hardware guidelines like Microsoft does with Windows Phones.</p>
<p>What happens to the millions of devices that are no longer in use. I have 2 old devices that will never get another update ever. Yet they are still connected to google play. Will we ever be able to remove these from the stats?</p>
<p>If they aren&#8217;t in use then they won&#8217;t be connecting to Google Play and therefore won&#8217;t be included in these stats.</p>
<p>I guess I need to somehow decommission all my old Android devices to fluff the numbers? And here I thought replacing my phones and tablets with new devices would automatically erase the old ones from the statistics.</p>
<p>These numbers come from actual Play store access, so your old unused devices aren&#8217;t affecting the numbers at all.</p>
<p>I just hate the fact that those 48% of Android users will never give Android a second thought after their contract is up. Gingerbread <em>was</em> horrible. Android only got good with ICS, maybe even JellyBean. And most will never even get to use a phone with an Android version above 2.3 because of ignorance.</p>
<p>As more flagships to be launched by more Android makers, more phone will be staying with 2.3, 4.0 and 4.1, this is how Android evolves. IF you wanna try 5.0. ditch your phone and buy a new one. Otherwise, no way.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s always been pretty clear that Android&#8217;s version adoption can be almost directly correlated to new device sales. The amount of ROMs and stuff like that that drive up the install base of older devices is pretty low, overall. What do these numbers really tell us? That 10% of Android users now have a phone that&#8217;s less than a year old. Beyond that, nothing. The older devices aren&#8217;t losing share because they&#8217;re getting updates, they&#8217;re losing share because they&#8217;re getting replaced. What that means, mostly, is that next year, this whole mess gets a whole new layer, but the problem remains. I think Google knows this, and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve lengthened the time between releases, to not further expose the reality of the problem. By the time JB makes significant market share gains, KLP will be out (or whatever L will be), and we&#8217;ll be having this conversation all over again.</p>
<p>It would be nice if they first invest time (and money) in getting all OEM&#8217;s on 4.0 instead of even thinking about 5.0&#8230; Well, at least we know after this WMC that 2013 will be the year of ICS.</p>
<p>Froyo 2.2 next iteration Gingerbread was 2.3 not 3.0.<br />
Jellybean will be 4.1, not 5.0.<br />
Get a clue.</p>
<p>And what came after Gingerbread 2.3? Honeycomb 3.0. After that? ICS 4.0.</p>
<p>To be fair Honeycomb is 3.x because it&#8217;s a whole different platform (essentially a spin-off).</p>
<p>Considering it went from 2.0/1 Eclair, 2.2 Froyo, 2.3 Gingerbread&#8230;I think it&#8217;s more likely to be a 4.x bump than a full bump like 5 would be.</p>
<p>But if they&#8217;re going to incorporate the whole Android@Home thing, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was an integer bump.  That&#8217;s arguable a new platform.</p>
<p>And what came after Gingerbread 2.3? Honeycomb 3.0. After that? ICS 4.0.</p>
<p>Just sayin&#8217;. Too early to tell what number it will be, but by no means is it absolutely 4.1.</p>
<p>Why not 5.0?</p>
<p>2.x was all made for the smaller, smartphone platform. Honeycomb, 3.x was made specifically for tablets, and ICS 4.o was the transition to a single Android that can be used on both smaller devices and tablets.</p>
<p>Because unless there&#8217;s another huge barrier to break through it will be an update like Eclair/Froyo/Gingerbread<br />
3.0 honeycomb was a tablet spinoff<br />
4.0 was the convergence of mobile &amp; tablet</p>
<p>Unless something major is happening or Google have decided to drop number convention then it should be 4.x</p>
<p>5.0 will probably (not definitely, of course) be for a whole major revision/update</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you&#8217;re right. I doubt they&#8217;d have a huge feature bump like they did with the redesigned interface of ICS so soon after 4.0. I&#8217;d wager it&#8217;s going to be a 4.1 or 4.2 rather than a 5.0.</p>
<p>How about you get one. It may be 4.1 or may be 5. Depends on the changes they introduce.</p>
<p>You just proved that the  numbering system and naming system is totally haywire. And you&#8217;re giving someone attitude for not being able to predict the next version number?</p>
<p>You lose.</p>
<p>Nop&#8230; if they did  it it would be money out of the window. They can&#8217;t force it to anyone and it will never be in the agenda of the OEM.<br />
They should enforce a policy of &#8220;raw android experience&#8221; on every phone upon it&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>OEM&#8217;s would lose money or so they think because they only way they can all get to 4.0 on time is to take off their skins but then they would lose all brand recognition. Well that is the lie they tell everyone but we all know that they can&#8217;t mess with WP7 and they don&#8217;t say anything about that.</p>
<p>Not saying this is the reason, but WP7 isn&#8217;t exactly a stellar success.</p>
<p>Yeah because they should wait for all the carriers to test 4.0 on every phone before they even think of starting 5.0.  Also, (according to Motorola), carriers want differentiation with stupid Android skins so that takes even longer to build into the OS.</p>
<p>How much <strike>say</strike> clout do you think Google has over the OEM&#8217;s and Carriers in updating their hardware to the latest OS? I agree they need to resolve the situation but short of paying these companies to do it what can they do?</p>
<p>Nothing. In the OEMs&#8217; eyes, they&#8217;d rather sell you a newer device than update current ones for free. Google&#8217;s job it&#8217;s to update Android&#8217;s source code, and that&#8217;s what the do &#8212; drive innovation.</p>
<p>You still have OEMs Releasing devices with 2.3 in 2012, smfh. They want to sell devices and make money; fxxk what version it has cuz it&#8217;s usually horribly skinned anyway. It&#8217;s their business model, and many of them are losing business to Apple, the other Android OEMs, or other platforms with such idiotic moves like that.</p>
<p>One of the only things they can do is to set up as much as possible to be run on the App level vs the OS level. Instead of having things tied to a potentially stalled OS level update control what they can which in this case is the App upgrades.  Things such as Gmail/Nav/ and Chrome can be updated and not stalled by VZW or or HTC/LG etc.  <br />
I suspect the Chrome Beta will see tremendous amounts of updates, in the near future, to keep the Customer Experience moving forward when the OEM&#8217;s are disinterested.</p>
<p>Get a Nexus.  Most people don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>It might not even be 5.0.</p>
<p>Froyo was 2.2<br />
Gingerbread was 2.3</p>
<p>Jelly Bean really might not be that big of a change. Or maybe it will. Probably not though. ICS is a big enough departure from Gingerbread on a low level. That&#8217;s why ROMs are coming out so slowly for them. They are coming out, but the CM team has themselves admitted they may not be able to beat OEMs to stable releases this time around. That&#8217;s saying something!</p>
<p>To be fair, CM took in so many devices that they need to get the code to work for that that&#8217;s also significantly slowing them down. There are plenty of ROMs out there from others that are working just fine on some of the more popular phones to develop for. I do agree with you that it probably won&#8217;t be 5.0 after such a jump to 4.0 just a few months ago.</p>
<p>Yeah, CM is working on 56 devices on 14 different OEM&#8217;s, every major carrier, across different CPU&#8217;s, while having to overcome not having driver&#8217;s and source-code necessary to port properly and also security meant specifically to keep them out. The fact that they are even giving the OEM&#8217;s a run for their money shows not only the commitment of the CyanogenMod team, but also that OEM&#8217;s are being pretty lazy with their updates if a team of hacker&#8217;s working for free/on donations can get the updates out competitively.</p>
<p>I agree with the caveat that if the carriers weren&#8217;t in the way with mandating design, code, and &#8220;testing&#8221;, that I believe OEMs could release their updates six months sooner.  The fact is that the carriers are their customers not us.  We bought phones from the carriers (at least in the US).  They are the ones on which we should dump most of our blame.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html">current Android OS distribution</a> (this is updated monthly) but it generally takes around a year for a &#8220;new&#8221; version of Android to become significant in market share terms.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is the way Android is developed; in a closed environment with the OS only being made available to partners when complete meaning a lot of work still have yet to be done to tailor the OS for hardware other than what it was originally targeted. Then there is vendor (manufacturer) testing and carrier testing &#8211; a tediously convoluted process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure things will improve unless Google adopt a different development/release process but arguably they don&#8217;t need too &#8211; Android is doing just fine!</p>
<p>What can Google do? Unless they start forcing them to stop skinning in order to speed up the process, Google has no control over the manufacturers speeds of updates.</p>
<p>Who said it will be 5.0? gingerbread was 2.3 and froyo was 2.2, Also I really hope jellybean is mostly under the hood improvements.</p>
<p>Also 2.0 and 2.1 were both eclair&#8230;.</p>
<p>I think Jelly Bean will likely be more like 4.1, 5.0 would have to be something special.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean could be 4.1 or 4.5 or 10.0</p>
<p>No one knows what is going into it so trying to predict the version number is pretty hard.</p>
<p>And irrelevant.</p>
<p>Google already said form the beginning that they would release Android updates at their schedule, and if OEMs cannot (or more correctly, do not) want to keep up, well, tough. As long as Google continues with the Nexus lineup, I don&#8217;t particularly mind.</p>
<p>I wish Google would invest 0 time into helping OEMs and tons of time into building their own brands.</p>
<p>If you want the best Android experience, it should come from Google. They&#8217;re doing a pathetic job of being an industry leader. Look at their competitors. The &#8220;Microsoft phone&#8221; (Nokia&#8217;s Lumia series) are the best selling WP7 devices on the market and Apple only has 1 iOS phone (so they are #1!). Where is the Nexus? (not even close to first).</p>
<p>If Google crushed the competition, this &#8220;fragmentation&#8221; crap would go away, because everyone would basically be on a Nexus.</p>
<p>The difference is, Apple is also a hardware company, making phones for profit. Google is NOT a hardware company. Their main income is not from selling Android/hardware. Their main income is from advertising, so to achieve that, the more the merrier, and to get more Android in more hands, they give it for free to any OEMs and carriers to do whatever they want. Google is not interested in you having the best Google experience, Google is more interested in having everybody on their browser seeing google ads, regardless of the experience.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t care how many Nexus devices are sold.  This doesn&#8217;t make them any money.  In fact, if Nexus were to dominate, they would lose their diversity of OEMs which would make the overall platform weaker.  Nexus is a platform for developers (and us geeks).</p>
<p>Maybe you should just get an HD2 and be running it on time like a Nexus device&#8230;</p>
<p>Hint hint!</p>
<p>LOL, I&#8217;d assume they were indeed delicious. =D</p>
<p>Cant we code name with healthy  food items?</p>
<p>No. Android users must become fat.</p>
<p>They could do Jicama (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%ADcama)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%ADcama)</a>, but people would think we&#8217;re back to the Hs.</p>
<p>Jasmine tea?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve done desserts the whole way, why stop now?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think they won&#8217;t use &#8216;Jello Pudding&#8217; for release after that.</p>
<p>Jello is a trademark can&#8217;t use that.</p>
<p>Android 4.1</p>
<p>nope.avi</p>
<p>i wonder if those are jelly bellys in that bowl. jelly bellys are the best.</p>
<p>They should of called it &#8220;bruschetta&#8221; (if you don&#8217;t know it, google it!)</p>
<p>Wait a sec.</p>
<p>They need to work on improving this chart before they can push JB (<a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html)" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html)</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?&cht=p&chs=460x250&chd=t:0.6,1.0,7.6,27.8,0.5,58.1,0.1,1.4,1.9,0.3,0.7&chl=Android%201.5|Android%201.6|Android%202.1|Android%202.2|Android%202.3|Android%202.3.3|Android%203.0|Android%203.1|Android%203.2|Android%204.0|Android%204.0.3&chco=c4df9b,6fad0c" /></p>
<p>At this rate, everyone will be stuck on Gingerbread.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html</a></p>
<p>I am the 1%&#8230;.with ICS.</p>
<p>Yup me too on my Gnex and Asus Transformer.</p>
<p>i am the 1%&#8230;..with android 1.5</p>
<p>For thee best experience and satisfaction, only go with Nexus devices. Google started their own line for a reason.</p>
<p>..unless you want the best battery life (like the razr maxx)..</p>
<p>&#8230;or a stylus like the galaxy note. &#8230;or a tegra 3 chip.. ..or a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going back to cupcake since they are tastiest.  I can&#8217;t believe that many people really prefer gingerbread.</p>
<p>Do they?</p>
<p><img title="Hosted by imgur.com" src="http://i.imgur.com/53pqo.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>So 2 months after the iOS 5 launch, almost half of iOS devices were on 5.0.1.</p>
<p>6 months after the ICS launch, 1% of Android devices are on 4.0 or 4.0.3.</p>
<p>What is your point exactly?</p>
<p>My point is that you were talking about the number of versions of Android that are out there not that they weren&#8217;t all on the same number. Don&#8217;t try to change your words around bro.</p>
<p>Wut.</p>
<p>Reading comprehension is not your friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this rate, everyone will be stuck on Gingerbread.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nowhere do I mention the number of Android versions.</p>
<p>What did you have in mind when you suggested to &#8220;improve this chart&#8221;?</p>
<p>To make a move to push carriers towards ICS.  I don&#8217;t see how that would be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Me neither. But if carriers are reluctant to move to ICS, do you expect Google to just drop all development of Android and wait until every phone is on the same version?</p>
<p>I expect Google and Android users to put fire to the carriers feet. But it seems that few people care. This situation will turn into a disaster for developers in the next few years.</p>
<p>Trust me, there&#8217;s nothing Google would like more than have manufacturers update their phones to ICS yesterday. And I&#8217;m hopeful the Motorola acquisition will help. Failing that, Google can&#8217;t just sit on their thumbs until the problem is fixed.</p>
<p>So you want low level Android designers and engineers to stop what they are doing and start managing client relationships with carriers and OEMs.  You should really consider writing the next business self help book.  I&#8217;m sure it would be a best seller.</p>
<p>Why are OEMs still releasing Android 2.3 phones at MWC12?<br />
Imagine if the the iPhone 6 launched with iOS 4.3 this fall.</p>
<p>2 things:</p>
<p>1. ICS&#8217;s code wasn&#8217;t launched 6 months ago.</p>
<p>2. I don&#8217;t see &#8220;half&#8221; of iOS devices on 5.0.1 on that chart. Which chart are YOU reading?!</p>
<p>Please take a closer look. The pie chart includes Android.</p>
<p>Not to mention the chart isn&#8217;t intended to show actual numbers of users on different OS versions.</p>
<p>6 months is debateable. The first ics phone wasnt released till long after the sdk was released.</p>
<p><strong>28.64% + 4.80% + .02%  = 33.46%</strong></p>
<p>Where did you get 50% from?</strong></p>
<p>ICS hasnt been out for 6 months.</p>
<p>Since we are all linking to charts:<br />

<p><img src="http://www.designsojourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/design-management-vs-design-thinking.jpg" /></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t even show the hopelessly fragmented black sheep of the Android family like the Nooks, Kindle, Archos, and countless Chinese $99 tablets that don&#8217;t have the Android Market and will never get Android updates.</p>
<p>Please. The Kindle fire and nook hardware are very suitable and aren&#8217;t black sheep. Amazon has shown it is dedicated to the kindle fire and will certainly continue to update it. It isn&#8217;t running stock android, the updates from 3.0 to 4.0 to etc. are not landscape changing for a device like that.</p>
<p>Yes there is some crappy hardware that isn&#8217;t google approved but you can&#8217;t lump the nook and fire into that statement.</p>
<p>The Kindle Fire and Nook can be considered basterdized versions of Android, controlled heavy handedly by their respective OEMs via System stifiling atrotious looking skins.<br />
Perfect tablets from the dumbed down state of america</p>
<p>So we meet again..</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall meeting but nice to meet you now :) What do you have for us today?</p>
<p>wow fail. This is a chart showing # of app crashes for each OS broken down by version. It has nothing to do with version penetration/adoption/whatever.</p>
<p>There is a partner lag time that comes after each new major Android release. Right now we&#8217;re barely four months from the release of ICS, with most makers publishing plans to release Android 4.0 on capable devices in the very near future.  I&#8217;d say they are doing quite well.</p>
<p>Seriously? Late 2012 for most Moto Droids is not the near future.</p>
<p>No, they need to keep improving Android. If the manufacturers are slow as hell with ICS, that in no way should and will stop Google for continuing work on the OS. What you should be saying is manufacturers (and carriers) need to stop BSing around with the updates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s way too late in the game for Google to force standardization on the OEMs. I wish it would happen, but it won&#8217;t. Maybe more people will start buying Nexus devices. Anyway, I can&#8217;t wait to get JB or whatever it&#8217;s called on my Nexus.</p>
<p>And how.</p>
<p>Google definitely needs to keep improving Android.  It just seems rather odd that their improvements aren&#8217;t getting out to &#8230; you know&#8230; most of the people using Android.</p>
<p>No, you need to work on improving that chart. We all do. It is not Google&#8217;s job to force OEMs to keep up, they make the code public and the OEMs should rush to get it to buyers&#8217; hands. If you want the latest updates, stop buying phones that do not recieve them. Vote with your wallet and show that you care.</p>
<p>Android does not work the same way as iOS, and it is not distributed the same way. If you want the latest version of an OS, iPhone and Nexus are your options.</p>
<p>Even with Nexus whether or not you get the latest up date is a guess.</p>
<p>ORLY?</p>
<p>I think the chart is pretty good, no need to improve it.</p>
<p>Badum tss.</p>
<p>and yet it doesn&#8217;t make a difference because they all function the same. I&#8217;ve used a ton of devices and after  2.2 there really haven&#8217;t been any major features added. 2.2 is compatible with most apps and provides and enough performance and functionality. Heck some people still make do with 1.6 I know plenty of people with G1&#8217;s and Archos 5&#8217;s.</p>
<p>So Google&#8217;s big hoopla over 4.0 was a farce?  Nothing to see here?  They should&#8217;ve just stopped development at 2.2?</p>
<p>4.0 is a big deal. Android 2.2 is comparable to iOS 3 or 4. 2.3 is comparable to iOS 4 or 5. ICS is comparable to iOS 5. iOS 4 works perfectly fine the majority of your uses. Major revisions are major revisions, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the old version suddenly sucks. If the majority of people are on a &#8216;modern&#8217; version of Android, that&#8217;s an accomplisment.</p>
<p>cuz of this my next gonna be iPhone, eff Android</p>
<p>? or you could just buy the phone from google? I dont know why people dont understand this. I would try and type it out for you but people already have countless amounts of times</p>
<p>Why should Google slow down with innovation just because OEMs can&#8217;t keep up?  If you are so worried about it buy only nexus phones. That&#8217;s what I do.</p>
<p>Google? Innovation? ha. ha. ha.</p>
<p>Yup. You don&#8217;t get to make the world&#8217;s #1 smartphone OS by grabbing other people&#8217;s inventions and calling them your own.</p>
<p>can&#8217;t tell if you&#8217;re being sarcastic or not.</p>
<p>Your right, you do it by giving it away for free.</p>
<p>Nailed it!</p>
<p>AND REALITY HAS SUNK IN.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good artists copy, great artists steal&#8221; &#8211; Andy Rubin</p>
<p>or, you know, through real innovations.</p>
<p>I would agree if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that the Nexus line truly does not represent everything a phone has to offer. Multiple radios for use on any carrier anywhere, external storage instead of having to rely on the cloud,  keyboard, etc etc then you have idiots like Verizon that either add more crap on it or disable stuff. So its not just a matter of keeping up, not everyone can drop so much for a new nexus phone every 6-12 months.</p>
<p>This reminds me of my favorite Mitch Hedberg joke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everytime I go to a craft fair I see a jar of jelly beans that says &#8216;Guess how many jelly beans are in the jar, and you win a prize?&#8217; C&#8217;mon man, let me just have some. I tell you what, you guess how many I want. If you said a handful, you are right.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://i.qkme.me/67xc.jpg" /></p>
<p>This is why I won&#8217;t buy anything that isn&#8217;t nexus</p>
<p>jelly beans = fragmentation&#8230;and most of the time jelly beans = party in my mouth</p>
<p>Seriously, you know how many flavors of Jelly Beans there are? Cmon&#8230;</p>
<p>Nilay&#8230; Did you count how many jelly beans were in the bowl??!!  That could be a clue as to when they will release it!  ARGH&#8230; Opportunity lost&#8230;</p>
<p>well played, google.</p>
<p>Google should really begin marketing Android as a brand. It has public awareness but to show people what differentiates it from iOS or Windows Phone. They have the money why not do it?</p>
<p>This is what Rubin mentioned. Bringing attention to the strength of their ecosystem vs Apple/Microsoft</p>
<p>What ecosystem would that be?  by the time the carriers are through crippling the OS it&#8217;s a closed system. I would hardly call syncing with gmail a real ecosystem.</p>
<p>Google services, including google music.<br />
Android market that sells Apps, Movies, and Music.<br />
Potentially a future tie in with home entertainment devices.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything Apple already does. Or at least they are trying to strengthen that aspect of Android so it is comparable.</p>
<p>Google had always been ahead of the game with seamless cloud syncage.</p>
<p>I think it really hurts that most consumers think everything is a &#8220;DROID&#8221; because Verizon has put more behind that brand than Google has behind Android.</p>
<p>Yea and Motorola could at least have given Droids a GOOD name.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to hoping that the Android version for the letter M is Macaroon.</p>
<p>That would be cool. My vote would be for Madeline but I bet they go with Marshmallow.<p>K will be Key Lime Pie, unless they have something weird up their sleeves like kiffles. And I can&#8217;t think of anything for L other than Lemon Something.</p></p>
<p>The real question is will Google license Zagnut when they finally get to Z?</p>
<p>Incidentally, what I&#8217;m sure are supposed to be jets of flame emitted from the Android&#8217;s feet as he flies look to me a little like jelly <em>fish</em>. #justsayin</p>
<p>I was thinking they looked like two Hadoukens.</p>
<p>This is a great idea on Google&#8217;s part.  Make everyone feel like crap by announcing the next upgrade when so many people haven&#8217;t even received the previous one.</p>
<p>Google continuing to develop and release major builds of Android faster than OEMs can keep up. And OEMs continuing to sacrifice current, and well performing builds of software in favor of gimmicks (Galaxy Note, Beam) and sluggish skins (everything but stock). Too bad Google doesn&#8217;t have the balls to simply say &#8220;Stock or GTFO&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google finally nailed it with ICS. There is absolutely no need for these skins anymore. They&#8217;re all going to be inferior to stock going forward.</p>
<p>By &#8220;nailed it&#8221;, you mean released an OS that 99% of the users cannot upgrade to yet? Or an OS that the few users that have it (Asus tablets for example) find unstable?</p>
<p>Galaxy Beam and Note both are interesting to me. I can see the merit in both of them. Neither are designed as the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; model that is going to get all the sales. That is the S&#8217;s</p>
<p>Anyone else notice that an Android tablet is plugged into tv running chrome?</p>
<p>FU Google! While everyone is stuck with GB, your manufacturers and carriers have piled on so much crap we can&#8217;t even get upgrades to ICS. Who the f&amp;^ck thinks they will ever see Jellybean on their phone?</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you show off a product we will actually get on our phones the next year.</p>
<p>Lol&#8230; tell them. When did Google ever own the manufacturers or carriers. Your funny : )</p>
<p>Your grammar is funny.</p>
<p>June 2010 &#8211; Release of iPhone4 with <strong>iOS 4.0</strong></p>
<p>October  2011 &#8211; Release of <strong>iOS 5.0</strong></p>
<p>Total time lapse: 16 months. So for everyone complaining about phones not getting upgraded, you would have went <strong>16 months</strong> from release day of iPhone 4 before you could get the next major release</p>
<p>By comparison:</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S II &#8211; released with <strong>2.3</strong> Let&#8217;s say October 2011 (it was a month either way depending on carrier)</p>
<p>16 months from then: <strong>Feb 2013</strong></p>
<p>If Samsung releases a 4.0 upgrade prior to that date (it is believed to be coming next month in March), it will blow away the time frame between MAJOR software releases by the iPhone.</p>
<p>Can people slow down and re-read what I just wrote?</p>
<p>Timely upgrades from Apple are smoke and mirrors because you are basing it one one release point.</p>
<p>With Android the releases are all staggered, but if you actually sat down and looked at one particular phone line you would see it make sense. For the most part. There are low end phones that wont get upgraded. You get what you play for. There are carriers who have screwed updates and slowed them down (see Galaxy S original)</p>
<p>Did Android 4.0 come out before a couple of months before the SGSII will get it? Yes. Is there an absurd wait period for it? No.</p>
<p>iOS 5 was &#8220;revealed&#8221; in June 2011. It wasn&#8217;t released until October. <em>4 months later</em>.<br />
How long was the time frame from ICS release (November 2011) to a potential March release of ICS for SGSII? <em>4 months</em></p>
<p>My Droid X ultimately received 3 major software versions 2.2, 2.2, and 2.3. Just another example to use.</p>
<p>If Jelly bean is released following a year to year scheduled in November 2012, and Samsung does in fact update the GSII 4 months after (March 2013, based on timing with ICS release), it would have went through <strong>two</strong> major software releases in the same time frame between iPhone 4 release and it&#8217;s <em>first</em> major software update (about 16 months). Obviously this is saying they do release it (and carriers don&#8217;t interfere), but the principle of timing is evident.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t recommend enough.</p>
<p>Correction, the Galaxy S2 was released in May 2011, not October.</p>
<p>Not in the US, where updates have been hampered by carrier control</p>
<p>You use the first launch dates for iPhones, so the same shall apply to Samsung first launch date for the SGS2, which is May 2011.</p>
<p>Fine, but all your doing is supporting my smoke and mirrors argument. Let&#8217;s try it again:</p>
<p>SGS II released in <strong>May 2011</strong> with <strong>2.3 Gingerbread</strong>. At the time this was &#8220;up to date&#8221;</p>
<p>ICS released <strong>Novemeber 2011</strong><br />
Either way, if the update comes as expected in March, it is still only <strong>4 months</strong> that the phone is not &#8220;Up to Date&#8221;.</p>
<p>The point remains the same. It isn&#8217;t Google&#8217;s fault the S2 was released in the summer, months before ICS was ready. Hence they could not engineer a phone built with that. The only phones that get that privilege are the Nexus phones.</p>
<p>Apple controls hardware and software releases, so it&#8217;s easy for them to release phones and software at strategic points.</p>
<p>Again, not everyone is perfect, the system is not perfect, and some OEMs have been terrible.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t compare it with Apple because they control both hardware and software and engineer their phones accordingly.</p>
<p>Ok I read it twice still a bunch of questionable facts, straw men and warmed over apologia&#8230;</p>
<p>The main problems are:</p>
<p> (1) that &#8220;time between major updates&#8221; and &#8220;time not up to date&#8221; are not the same thing.  No one cares about the former except people looking for an angle that makes Android look better.  Everyone cares about the latter.</p>
<p>(2) iOS may undergo major updates less frequently but the in between updates are also much more substantial.  4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 comprise more then a single &#8220;major update&#8221; worth of improvements from the many security updates, bug fixes, stability enhancements and other quality of life updates to major feature releases &#8212; Airplay, HDR photos, mobile hotspot, Nitro JS engine, Airprint, Game Center, movie rental streaming, etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what facts are questionable, I tried to double check everything I put. There could be something wrong, in which case someone can chime in. As for the rhetorical points, well I simply was trying to state my opinion.</p>
<p>At the end of the discussion, the fact is the update/software set-up for Google is less than ideal than Apple. That isn&#8217;t Google&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>Apple can show something, work on it, release it for every iteration of their hardware because they control it.</p>
<p>Google can show something, release it for their Nexus devices and the source code, and then other manufacturers have to go to work. Are some of them much worse than others at getting updates out? Yes of course.</p>
<p>To address point #1, the &#8220;time not up to date&#8221;  is controlled by Apple. It&#8217;s why I said it&#8217;s &#8220;smoke and mirrors&#8221;. Apple is the hardware and software developer, they are developing software that runs on their hardware.</p>
<p>OEMs do not have access to the Android code until it is finished. This difference means that Apple can release when it&#8217;s finished. OEMs have to take the code and adapt it. Are their skins and changes crap sometimes? Yes. But the fact is even at its stock core there are changes that need to be made.</p>
<p>So naturally there is a &#8220;time not up to date&#8221; that is 100% out of control of the OEMs (and Google). Once again, some are worse than others at extending that time, but it will NEVER be as perfect as Apple because of the different structure. People need to accept that. It&#8217;s why phones still get released on Gingerbread. All the engineering was based around that OS level.</p>
<p>As for #2, I don&#8217;t know the complete change logs of each update. But I believe most of what you mentioned were brought about in &#8220;major&#8221; jumps. All Android phones have gotten OTA updates that consist of bug fixes/security enhancements,/etc. that aren&#8217;t considered part of the direct Android upgrade cycle. So I could kind of say the same thing about Android</p>
<p>Oh yum! I like jelly beans and I probably have a better chance of getting Jelly Bean than ICS for my Droid 4.</p>
<p>By the time Jelly Bean is released, Verizon would already have Droid 9 Maxx, and would rather you to upgrade and extend your contract than update your Droid 4.</p>
<p>Sure Google, keep releasing updates that noone gets to use. How&#8217;s your 1% ICS userbase doing? By the time JB rolls out, most of us will still be on gingerbread and maybe a few % on ICS.</p>
<p>Try actually pushing manufacturers to force an update for recent hardware why don&#8217;t you? A 6 month old phone should be able to receive ICS or any update, but it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Immense failure of the Android platform.</p>
<p>Ahh! A scary, colorful germ-pit!</p>
<p>what are they gonna do when they get to a letter that has no dessert counterpart&#8230;or better yet when they run out of letters?</p>
<p>they&#8217;ll start over with letters, but something else that isn&#8217;t desserts.</p>
<p>How about a series of 26 named after features promised for but pushed from previous versions where they actually release those features?</p>
<p>BOOOOOOOOOOM!! Nice&#8230; one Verge!</p>
<p>its just an internal codename, why do you nerds care so much?</p>
<p>im a phone nerd, but in the end of the day, i dont care about the internal codename of a fragmented phone OS with a boring UI</p>
<p>You use to be cool man&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh snap!</p>
<p>android is fragmented shit</p>
<p>ur fragmented shit</p>
<p>Lets try&#8230;.</p>
<p>1. Alpha (1.0)<br />
2. Beta (1.1)<br />
3. Cupcake (1.5)<br />
4. Donut (1.6)<br />
5. Eclair (2.0)<br />
6. Froyo (2.2)<br />
7. Gingerbread (2.3)<br />
8. Honeycomb (3.0)<br />
9. Ice Cream Sandwich<br />
10. Jelly Bean<br />
11. K ?<br />
12. L ?<br />
13. Mango!<br />
14. N?<br />
15. O ?</p>
<p>Ahhh&#8230;. I give up.</p>
<p>Microsoft already took Mango.</p>
<p>If by &#8216;took&#8217; you mean, used the word and no one on earth knows about it.</p>
<p>Kinda like the original &#8216;iPhone&#8217; Trademark</p>
<p>Klondike Bar? Kit-Kat? Nah, there&#8217;s only one: Key Lime Pie.<br />
Lolly-pop or Licorice Stick.<br />
Mango? No way. How &#8217;bout..CUPCAKE! I mean, dang YouTube, how about Marshmallow.<br />
No Bake Cookie? Nila Wafer? Nutterbutter?<br />
Orange Creamsicle, Oreo</p>
<p>Some of these name brand options are a real opportunity for certain food companies :)</p>
<p>Key Lime Pie, Lollipop, Marshmallow sounds pretty good for upcoming version names. But for the others, they can&#8217;t use candy/sweets brand names unless they license the rights, can they?</p>

<p>Do you have ideas for the remaining?</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t they just call it Ice Cream?  Why tack on the unnecessary Sandwich?</p>
<p>heh, why not?</p>
<p>You remember Froyo (Frozen Yogurt)? Well, supposedly they thought Ice Cream would be too similar, so they decided to call it Ice Cream Sandwich.</p>
<p>That makes Jelly Donut highly unlikely then because Donut was already used.</p>
<p>Because it combines Honeycomb from tablets and Gingerbread from phones and combines them into one unifying OS, like a sandwich.</p>
<p>Bahaha, you&#8217;re giving them way way WAY too much credit</p>
<p>I think the B was 1.1, I remember getting an update for my G1 a few months after I got it and cupcake was about 4 months after that.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, 1.1 was known as &#8220;Petit Four&#8221; internally.</p>

<p>Doubtful. Even Z has zabaglione. And X can be many Chinese desserts since lots of words start with X.</p>
<p>I knew it!</p>
<p>ahahahahaha more mythical, amazing features that get pushed back again</p>
<p>Mythical, amazing features are reserved for Apple products.</p>
<p>Not sure if this warrants the exclusive tag&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, it is exclusive, even if it was one of the names that people thought it would be (along with Jello shots). </p>
<p>&#8220;the "game-changing stuff" that had originally been scheduled for Ice Cream Sandwich is now being pushed to Jelly Bean&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope this is not true. </p>
<p> Is this the game changer stuff that was meant to be in Honeycomb?</p>
<p>Its always being pushed back. So now ICS will pretty much be gingerbread in a new color</p>
<p>ICS will probably be the merger of honeycomb and gingerbread with little else.<br />
For 6 months that is going to be a major challenge</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, why would anyone want to upgrade? Honeycomb isn&#8217;t very polished on tablets, how is it going to magically work on phones?</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll most likely be very similar to what it is currently on phones. The UI is meant to change depending on screen size, they&#8217;re not just shrinking Honeycomb onto a phone, so it&#8217;ll just be UI tweaks.<br />
For the end user, it just means both Gingerbread and Honeycomb get tweaked, and that apps sync well across tablet sizes, as I understand it. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just heard it trumpeted too often that ICS is &#8220;bringing Honeycomb to phones&#8221;. For myself, I personally hate the UI styling of Honeycomb, and don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s a well thought-out version. While we shall see what benefits it will bring in the near future, there&#8217;s really nothing about Honeycomb that makes me want it on a phone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard anyone say ICS is &#8220;bringing Honeycomb to phones&#8221;.</p>

<p>A quick search on Google wouldn&#8217;t have hurt. Also complimented by real world discussion, which it seems you don&#8217;t have much of.</p>
<p>How bout reading those articles before appearing like a prick. Those articles all say they are bringing honeycomb FEATURES and ELEMENTS. Noone said they were going to bring the Honeycomb styling to mobile devices.</p>
<p>Noone&#8217;s falling for your straw man fallacy.</p>
<p>Thanks for ignoring the real-world argument I brought up. That&#8217;s the impression Google has given in general, and I have been specifically told so.</p>
<p>Is design not an element? No one is falling for your desperate dismissal. Some quotes from the previous sources:</p>
<p>&#8220;UI elements&#8221;<br />
User interface elements. That&#8217;s very, very close to the look consumers will see.</p>
<p>&#8220;a  &#8220;holographic&#8221; user interface&quot;<br />
You going to argue with this?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re pathetic. Stick to phandroid, you won&#8217;t get flamed for blind pro-Android comments there.</p>
<p>Oh you don&#8217;t like the blue theme?  Cuz what Honeycomb brings to the table is a great multitasking tool, many browser enhancements and smooth animations.  The launcher is way powerful also.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember when they said Gingerbread would bring a &#8220;major UI overhaul&#8221; only then to find nothing but a black notification bar <strong>sigh</strong></p>
<p>To be fair, they did fix the copy&amp;paste issue which was just painful in FroYo.  It&#8217;s still klunky but a lot better now.  Also I like the orange effect when the page reaches the end and the new keyboard. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t mean to troll but it&#8217;s funny how WP7 was flamed for no C&amp;P on launch, when it launched before Gingerbread&#8217;s release (of course something is better than nothing, but still). I&#8217;d bet that most Android users eventually got proper C&amp;P around the same time or past the rollout of NoDo.</p>
<p>IMO the orange effect is a bad workaround the Apple patent. The Microsoft workaround is actually very clever. If you&#8217;ve used a Windows Phone, the content actually &#8220;squashes up&#8221; when you reach the end then spreads out again. This gives the impression of scrolling past the edge while not infringing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference between &#8220;oh, shitz, i have to tap and hold then choose &#8216;select text&#8217; then select my text then tap again to copy&#8221; and &#8220;oh, shitz, no copy and paste, i can&#8217;t do much.&#8221; This is why people dissed WP7&#8217;s lack of copy &amp; paste. It also had several missing features that existed at the time in both iOS and Android.</p>
<p>But Mango&#8217;s on par with the rest of the OSes :)</p>
<p>My Android phone still does not have proper copy’n’paste and that’s running Gingerbread.</p>
<p>Huh? What phone would that be.</p>
<p>Xperia Play. But I’ve noticed already that I have to lower my expectations, coming from an iPhone. Highlighting and copying text on Android is just so clunky and inconsistent, it’s incredible. Only WebOS was even worse than that. I’d like to know how Microsoft scores at copy’n’paste.</p>
<p>Copy and Paste has been in Android from the beginning&#8230; not all applications expose it the way they should though, and that isn&#8217;t a fault of the OS, but instead of the application.  The frustrating problem is that this is also true of some of Google&#8217;s applications.  The framework is in place, but if it isn&#8217;t utilized, it doesn&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>On the Xperia Play, I&#8217;m sure where you are missing Copy and Paste is a product of the applications you are using.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s obviously going to be a bit more than that. For one thing the Nexus Prime is apparently being built without hardware buttons (too late to change that surely). so there is going to have to be some major UI changes at any rate &#8211; in which case the tablet/phone unification deal could still be on track. I think the Music Beta mobile app offers a preview of what might be on the cards in that regard.</p>
<p>Very disappointing to here some supposedly very cool stuff is being delayed, but maybe it&#8217;s better than releasing half-finished software. Talking of Music beta, perhaps they were planning some major cloud offering which they haven&#8217;t been able to get ready yet at the required scale. Schmidt enthused strongly about such things in that SalesForce video posted a couple of days ago, without saying anything specific at all. </p>
<p>Anyway, I hope ICS is followed in relatively short order by Jelly Bean. I think Apple&#8217;s iOS5 cloud integration is going to go down very well indeed so Android needs to be offering something pretty compelling to avoid the ever-present risk of being labelled the &#8220;poor man&#8217;s iphone&#8221;.</p>
<p>And I really can&#8217;t wait to choose between the Nexus Prime and the iPhone 5. I&#8217;ve been using this Hero for far too long.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen you at the &quot;Hero Owner&#8217; meetings&#8230;especially in the &#8217;I&#8217;m waiting for the Nexus Prime&#8217; room. Maybe that&#8217;s because I was briefly in the &#8216;Maybe I&#8217;ll settle for the Samsung Galaxy S II&#8217; room. I think I have left that room&#8230;maybe&#8230;.HELP!</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s because I actually spent a little time in &#8220;Considering the Nexus S&#8221; and have just been hanging around in the lobby since then. Whilst the arrival of the more advance hardware of the Galaxy SII relatively soon after the Nexus S did vindicate my decision to give the latter a miss, the Galaxy never really appealed.<br />
So come away from that room. It only leads down to the &#8220;Waiting ages to get updated to Ice Cream Sandwich&#8221; stairs, and I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;d want to descend them just to reach the &#8220;Will I ever get Jelly Bean?&#8221; dungeon. It&#8217;s horribly cold and lonely down there.<br />
No, the Nexus Prime waiting area might be frustrating for a while, but it&#8217;s only two months and then they&#8217;ll fling open the doors to a beautiful garden where there will be Ice Cream and Music and a perennially updated OS.</p>
<p>The iPhone party also serves the premium booze.  Golden Goose anybody?</p>

<p>you can really call it the &#8220;poor man&#8217;s iphone&#8221; they just jack the price up for a shit product cause unfortunately the majority of civilization are too fucking retarded and stupid to think for themselves and know what theyr doing, again you can hardly call it poor as most phones are on plans for a low upfront cost or a few dollars a month repayment.. people on the dole can afford a fucking iphone with a telco, and it dosn&#8217;t stop them from being fucking retarded and wanting one in the first place. <br />
not going into the fact just you just compared iphone to android, the only similarity they have is a touchscreen, iphone and apple is a disgusting joke, jobs is the genious in all of this, he&#8217;s sold shit products and made everyone think they have the &#8216;brand&#8217; name, when they spend shit all on producing the product, and fuck all effort creating it, meanwhile everyone actually looks like a dumbass for having an iphone. genious.</p>
<p>Darwin&#8217;s beard! You know what your comment makes me think? That when we stop going to war over resources, when we stop going to war over religion, when we stop going to war over economics and politics and ideology, we&#8217;ll still be killing each other over some shit or other.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next next version is going to be really awesome&#8221;</p>
<p>And most phones will get it as soon as the next version after that comes out.</p>
<p>Apple is doing the same thing.<br />
Do you think &#8216;multi-tasking&#8217; was originally scheduled for iOS4?</p>
<p>Actually Google is acting more like Apple do with hardware than with Software.  With their OS releases Apple publishes major features months in advance, around the time that developer betas start to show up &#8211; it&#8217;s only with hardware releases that they turn on the stealth mode.</p>
<p>So 5 months from IOS 5s expected release we knew almost everything about it, whereas 2 months from ICS we know almost nothing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Google behaving this way of course &#8211; so long as testing doesn&#8217;t suffer for it, in fact it&#8217;s good marketing both because it makes for a nice big reveal and because if a feature gets pulled it can do so quietly even at the last minute.</p>
<p>To me at least, the thing that matters most in ICS is system-wide hardware acceleration, and I can&#8217;t see Google not throwing that in, with Honeycomb already have it.</p>
<p>It still kills me that my girlfriend&#8217;s iphone 1 scrolls text smoother than my droid x (with CM7).</p>
<p>I know what you mean. Hardware acceleration is my last hope for Android. Scrolling, even typing, zooming, going through pictures is ugly without a dual core. I&#8217;m a fan but they better fix it asap or I might get the i5 if it&#8217;s good enough.</p>

<p>Android&#8217;s Upcoming future version after Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 is Android Jelly Bean 5.0</p>
<p>Check it out below :</p>

<p>&#8220;the "game-changing stuff" that had originally been scheduled for Ice Cream Sandwich is now being pushed to Jelly Bean&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope this is not true. </p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait. This&#8217;ll probably be Google I/O&#8217;s 2012 big announcement.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait. This&#8217;ll probably be Google I/O&#8217;s 2012 big announcement.</p>
<p>You jellin&#8217; or just jelly?</p>
<p>You jellin&#8217; or just jelly?</p>
<p>Darn. I was hoping for Jello Shots.</p>
<p>Man, I got so excited that someone had made Android Jelly Beans. Now I have to live with the fact it&#8217;s only the name of an OS :(</p>
<p>Delicious! Though hopefully this doesn&#8217;t mean Ice Cream Sandwich will be a disappointment&#8230; </p>
<p>i was hoping for krispy kremes. brb.</p>
<p>Gingerbread came out?</p>
<p>Gingerbread&#8217;s been out for a long time!</p>
<p>yup 2.3 is Gingerbread. Dont feel bad.</p>
<p>I love how Android makes me hungry</p>
<p>There was me, getting ready to eat my jelly bean sandwich.</p>
<p>Comments thread! Let&#8217;s all predict what&#8217;s coming after &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start with K: Kola Kube!</p>
<p>Next up: M. Go!</p>
<p>Surely, after K comes L?  Lemon Lollipops anyone?</p>
<p>Ah! Sorry, I&#8217;m going crazy again. Will update for accuracy now! Thanks!</p>
<p>Lemonade is nice, by the way.</p>
<p>Now: M! Go people!</p>
<p>Lemon drops is an easy one.</p>
<p>Moon pie. Marshmallow Fluff</p>
<p>I think &#8220;N&#8221; might be a futuristic candy not invented yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling it!</p>
<p>Try KY Jelly. At the rate these updates come along &amp; further fracture Android, that is what you need to soothe the f&#8230;ing Google is giving you.</p>
<p>And that is coming from an Android user by the way</p>
<p>Wow, I&#8217;ve been hearing this every time a new update comes to Android. Every time they say these &#8216;amazing features&#8217; are in e nest version and always &#8216;pushed back&#8217;. This is really starting to irritate me. Google needs to get eir shit together.</p>
<p>I hear you&#8230; it&#8217;s irritating, but google really doesn&#8217;t <strong>need</strong> to do anything.</p>
<p>they&#8217;re doing just fine&#8230; As long as ad revenue keeps coming in, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re using android 1.5 on a toaster oven &#8211; they get paid just the same.</p>
<p>maybe the moto acquisition will help them innovate more than just immitate and acquire&#8230;</p>
<p>After Jelly Bean comes Krispy Kreme.</p>
<p>Pretty sure that would result in trademark infringement lawsuit, lol.</p>
<p>Infringement, litigation<br />
doesn&#8217;t matter</p>
<p>They could just buy Krispy Kreme&#8230;. $500 million would be probably be the most expensive donut ever&#8230;. </p>
<p>Google would swallow Krispy Kreme whole :)</p>
<p>They only use these as code names. The fact that the code names go public means nothing. They&#8217;re technically not official names outside Google.</p>
<p>Lemon Lime&#8230;Marshmallow Madness&#8230;?</p>
<p>is that ubuntu releases?! =o)</p>
<p>Nutty Nougat&#8230;Orange Marmalade&#8230;</p>
<p>Too close to what a donut looks like.</p>
<p>What about Karamel?</p>
<p>If you think that is going to happen&#8230; well your wrong!</p>
<p>The only piece of software.. isn&#8217;t it in-cra-ab-la  (insane old engadget podcast reference) </p>
<p>I&#8217;m officially predicting Android Knickerbocker Glory as the version after Jelly Bean</p>
<p>You can use this image for your Android logo, I just made it. It fits Android Jelly Bean much better. <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dEbmeldB36g/Tmqap_frxfI/AAAAAAAAFFE/LkKTHRlQReU/androidjellybean.png" target="_blank">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dEbmeldB36g/Tmqap_frxfI/AAAAAAAAFFE/LkKTHRlQReU/androidjellybean.png</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to guess &#8220;K&#8221; is going to be &#8220;Key Lime Pie&#8221;. &#8220;L&#8221; is Lemon &#8220;Lemon Meringue&#8221;.</p>
<p>After that they can call it &#8220;Killed Apple&#8221;</p>
<p>Or Killed Battery.</p>
<p>Maybe you should wait until they haven&#8217;t had like 10 record breaking quarters in a row before you start with that shit.</p>
<p>Record breaking in terms of loss of market share yeah</p>
<p>Eh, not with Nokia and RIM to compare them to.</p>
<p>Do you get a lot of twitter followers looking for that amazing sense of humor you have?</p>
<p>twitter sucks, I&#8217;m big on Google+ and YouTube</p>
<p>twitter sucks, I&#8217;m big on Google+ and YouTube</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally, our source tells us he’s hearing that the "game-changing stuff" that had originally been scheduled for Ice Cream Sandwich is now being pushed to Jelly Bean&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope they&#8217;re not talking about hardware acceleration support. This is very disheartening though, to say the least.</p>
<p>Err&#8230; If hardware acceleration at the end of 2011 is game changing, I don&#8217;t know what to say.</p>
<p>dude, hardware acceleration is already in honeycomb</p>
<p>only partially, one area where it&#8217;s absent is in the browser where it really matters. screw third party browsers</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in my browser (Tab 10.banned).</p>
<p>Yeah but we have yet to see it in Android Phones even though competitors have had it since day one. It was supposed to be in Gingerbread and now IceCream Sandwich is supposed to bridge a gap between honeycomb and gingerbread and one of the only bridges I can think of is hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>This has been Google&#8217;s MO in regards to Android for a while. Wake up and smell the shit.</p>
<p>Hardware acceleration has already been done. It&#8217;s called Honeycomb.</p>
<p>But we are talking about Ice Cream Sandwich, the OS update for mobile phones.</p>
<p>I was just talking about this with my family at dinner last night&#8230;we decided that it had to be Jelly Bean, since Jello was copyrighted, I&#8217;m glad to see that we deduced correctly!</p>
<p>Whenever I bring up geeky stuff like this with my wife she looks at me like I&#8217;m stupid.</p>
<p>Thats one fucked up family.</p>
<p>Thats one fucked up family.</p>
<p>Ok, so when are Android Gummy Bear or Android Twinkie coming?</p>
<p>&#8220;the "game-changing stuff" that had originally been scheduled for Ice <br />
Cream Sandwich is now being pushed to Jelly Bean&#8221;</p>
<p>That is so Google, always in the beta, always delaying the &#8220;game-changing stuff&#8221;</p>
<p>This changes everyth&#8230; err nothing.</p>
<p>What? no jujubes?</p>
<p>So far they&#8217;ve avoided sweet treats/desserts with any associated brand. They&#8217;re keeping it generic. They could have gone with Jelly Tart&#8230;but I don&#8217;t think they want to advertise how they&#8217;re going to tease us once again&#8230;</p>
<p>I have a hunch that since they now have  to compete with Windows 8, Android will transition from a mobile OS to a fully fledged one, they will need to do this otherwise W8 will gobble up all their tablet marketshare (or lack there of)</p>
<p>Yet Google chose to unify the PHONE with the tablet. If they plan on taking on Windows, then either Android will be forked by themselves or the phone experience will be a clunky mess.</p>
<p>Exactly, so this why Google are in a really tight situation now. It would be interesting how  exactly they will tackle this if this is in fact the case.</p>
<p>But to be honest, Microsoft also has to come across the issue of how they are going to differentiate programs (not apps) from ARM and x86 processors as there is no legacy support</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s kind of shady. We see Android tablets &amp; phones to be sharing the same operating system with identical everythings on top in ICS. What I see Microsoft doing is essentially segregating desktop and tablet now, with the tablet being primarily touch and the desktop primarily legacy. Perhaps Google will be doing that too &#8211; essentially having to create two separate experiences in one operating system that changes based on the hardware.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m not wrong, Steven Sinofsky has hinted at the possibility of WP apps on W8.</p>
<p>It was the NVIDIA boss instead</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking integrated chrome OS via a dock &#8211; like the moto atrix but googley.</p>
<p>Yeah they&#8217;ve talked about combining Chrome OS with Android sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Ice Cream Sandwich is supposed to combine elements of Gingerbread &amp; Honeycomb&#8230;I can&#8217;t see why Jelly Bean wouldn&#8217;t combine ICS with Chrome. Though probably not likely, it doesn&#8217;t sound implausible&#8230;</p>
<p>If i had my guess, Chrome and Android combo wont come till Jelly Bean. Plus the current phones might be ble to handle that type f change. Some major Api over haul would be needed as well.</p>
<p>I think I know the whole series. </p>
<p>Yeah, looks like I&#8217;m sticking with Windows Phone.</p>
<p>This is the funniest comment so far!<br />
&#8220;sticking with Windows Phone.&#8221;<br />
absolutely hilarious!</p>
<p>A few more months it might not be that funny, the UI of that phone is quite nice. Huge developer base. Windows will gain market share come end of the year and have big gains come 2012. Mark my words.</p>
<p>The ui is nice everywhere but on the homescreen. I want my Widgets. It works, I would just gchose androids homwscreen any day over wp&#8217;s</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sticking with telepathy. Fewer dropped calls. No tiered data plans. And virtually no lag&#8230; unless I&#8217;ve had a few beers.</p>
<p>So in other words &#8220;ice cream sandwich&#8221; will not introduce hardware acceleration. My guess would be that Google want to save this feature for dual core phones, which presently make up less than 5% of the (android) smartphone market. <br />
It&#8217;s a sad truth, but I&#8217;ve yet to use a multi-core handset that didn&#8217;t suffer from lag.</p>
<p>H/W acceleration was part of HC, so should be part of ICS too. Whether they finished HC&#8217;s incomplete implementation is another story&#8230;</p>
<p>Have y</p>
<p>Quadcore phone? Jeez, that would cook my leg, dual core is hot as it is already.</p>
<p>Quad core? Just for smooth scrolling and a non-laggy UI? This is Android&#8217;s problem, and just like Windows a decade ago, it needs optimization for the current hardware and not expect a quad core just to run okay.</p>
<p>They should have called it Jaffa Cake. Sounds like unifying the OS has been harder than expected. I certainly hope in addition to the unification they finally put some polish on this thing.</p>
<p>Yognaught?</p>
<p>Just like they said that Gingerbread would be a game-changer when compared to Froyo. </p>
<p>Not an exclusive, not even new, this name has been floating around almost as long as Icecream sandwich.</p>
<p>I called it Jelly Bean months ago. It was either going to be Jelly Bean or Jewish Mother <del>- both are just so sweet. :</del>)</p>
<p>I think a Jewish Princess would be sweeter than a Jewish Mother, but still not as sweet as a Druish Princess</p>

<p>IMO the strength of Verge is reporting on products which actually exist.  Ice Cream Sandwich hasn&#8217;t been released and attention is being diverted from it already. This is a curious marketing strategy if the source is  from inside Google.</p>
<p>Really &#8230; Jelly Bean, Penis Bean who cares, they already named this one Ice Cream Sandwich, so it can only get better.</p>
<p>Penis bean you pulled that out of the random word file? hmmmmm. Pulled out. I made a funny.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not Jelly Bean, it will be Jawa Juice. Many Bothans died to bring me this information.</p>
<p>tinyurl.com/2df4ccp</p>
<p>Call it Juice! How awesome. I would buy anything running on Juice. Jelly Bean is corny. Juice is badass.</p>
<p>I think you misunderstood: he said it&#8217;ll be a &#8220;name-changer&#8221;.</p>

<p>I hope it is more than just &#8220;Jimmies&#8221; on my &quot;Ice cream sandwich. &quot;</p>
<p>Jell-o!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I called this via twitter on May 15th. @future_appleceo:twitter &lt;- &#039;tis me</p>
<p>OK Whats with the names?!?!?! Ohh and when is android &#8220;strawberry dildo&#8221; coming out XD</p>
<p>I thought is was going to be Jelly <em>Roll</em>, not Jelly Bean&#8230;</p>
<p>I was hoping Google would go the way of brand licensing and name it Jello or Jujyfruits</p>
<p>Everything will be pushed off until &#8220;Kugel&#8221; is released.</p>
<p>My money&#8217;s on &#8216;Key Lime Pie&#8217; for the next version. I hear everything worthwhile is being withheld until Key Lime Pie is out.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t say your joke will prove to be true (althought it just might)&#8230;but I&#8217;m willing to bet even money that the next name will indeed be Key Lime Pie&#8230;.because there&#8217;s NO OTHER DESSERT that starts with K (that isn&#8217;t part of a known Brand).</p>
<p>&gt;Ctrl + F<br />
&gt;Jaffa Cake<br />
&gt;only 1 result</p>
<p>Son I am disappoint</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see what name they would pick when it gets to Q, X, etc.</p>
<p>Well, the Honeycomb version was pretty much an early beta and phone guises of Android lacked revolutionary features they promised.</p>
<p>If Google continues with this rather unfortunate trend it set up and has been following, we&#8217;ll end up with Android &#8220;Rocky Road&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;which it has always been for end users when it came to updates from OEMs as, for example, not even some phones released after Gingerbread will ever get that update.</p>
<p>Ice Cream Sandwich haven&#8217;t come out yet now got new Jelly Bean name&#8230; Idiot Google&#8230; such a rubbish OS.</p>

<p>I was hoping that ICS would smoooooth out the UI of Android. I really hope that its not what has been put back to Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>BTW what is the screen refresh rate on Android? I hear that iOS is around 60hz</p>
<p>Your missing Jelly Donut!</p>
<p>They already had a version named donut, so I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d go that route again.</p>

<p>Honestly, who cares what it is called? You have no idea what ics or the next version will include so why talk about it? It would be great if you could write about something solid</p>

<p>You are a troll, because I care. :p</p>
<p>and K  is for Krabby Patty .. </p>
<p>They&#8217;ll have to call it Java Jello as part of the settlement terms with Oracle </p>
<p>Most people still don&#8217;t even know what ICS will do other than:<br />
1) &#8216;merge&#8217; the tablet and phone OS<br />
2) fully open Android again.</p>
<p>2) &#8211; believe that if you will</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess we’ll see. My point is that there seems to be a lot of hype over this ICS, but we have very little in the way of details.</p>
<p>Android will never go back to the level of &#8220;openness&#8221; that they had before. There is too much for Google to lose. It is one thing for the likes of Amazon and Baidu to fork from Froyo or Gingerbread &#8211; imagine if they have source to ICS right away. No, if they do O-S it, it will be once all the manufacturers who bow down to Rubin&#8217;s control have got theirs one step ahead.</p>
<p>I sense, from here in Paris (across the pond, yeah), a feeling of concern: (1) the be speckled J., with the American rethotics kicking, is: &#8220;I am right, and only I, am right; and I will be happier again when N. is out of my sight.&#8221; (2) N.: &#8220;Is rational thinking out of the window now in this country?&#8221; (3) P.: as long as my job is safe, I talk to anyone in my normal friendly tune; even I do not like that person. (3) J.: Yeah, I know. I am still a woman and I am cut out all the time while opinionating, and I am kind of getting used to it now.&quot;</p>
<p>Man, this some mighty fine uber shit we&#8217;re smokin here.</p>
<p>in ten years&#8217; time the answer to &#8220;who&#8217;s smoking now&#8221; will pop up in your face&#8230;</p>
<p>Listening to a This is My Next Podcast, I don&#8217;t hear success but hear the very repeated story for The Verge in the long run (7 years, 10 years from now), before even it&#8217;s already started: the repeated story of Yahoo!, AOL, HP&#8230;</p>
<p>Cocaine is a helluva drug huh</p>
<p>im not a fan of any OS, but i am curious of what exactly ICS will contain.</p>
<p>Jam? Jell-o? Jujube? Jelly donut?  Jelly tart?</p>
<p>The Android team is not being creative enough.</p>
<p>They made a terrible decision releasing Honeycomb half-baked.  They should have simply held off and launched ICS properly in October (or earlier).  Now they&#8217;ll have wasted time and effort on ICS and are behind on Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Two contradicting sources.</p>
<p>Original Text: Jelly Bean fixed as name, no game changing stuff in ICS</p>
<p>Update: Jelly Bean possible name, game changing stuff in ICS.</p>
<p>At least a combination of these statements will be obviously right. Wow&#8230;.</p>

<p>Okay google, we get it. We know you guys are just the cutest, lovable search site that names their phone updates ice cream and jelly beans, and have random doodles on your search page. When the shit hits the fan and absolutely none of our private information is private anymore, google won&#8217;t seem so  adorable then. </p>
<p>I deleted my Gmail account yesterday after Google wouldn&#8217;t let me view a page unless my mobile phone number was provided. Yes I could have entered any old random shit, but that&#8217;s not the point: it&#8217;s the principle of not having to give out my private details to some multinational conglomerate.</p>
<p>What the hell website was that????</p>
<p>Surely this Jelly Bean version is going come up with many new features.<br />

<p>"EXCLUSIVE: Next Android version, number unknown, may be called Jelly Bean, or not, and it may have unknown features that were previously scheduled for the upcoming Ice Cream Sandwich, whose features, again, are unknown as well."</p>
<p>That&#8217;s called illusion, making clients (us) feel like having read something exclusive so to getting the attention&#8230; (while in fact like farting in the air to make people run for their lives in the fear of cannons)&#8230; better reading news sources with research and solid confirmation; that way when it does explode there is at least something in the bang&#8230;</p>
<p>Saw way too much news with &#8220;rumour&#8221; and &#8220;?&#8221; mark in it in 2011&#8230; way too much&#8230;</p>
<p>EXCLUSIVE: We may or may not know that something may happen but only if there&#8217;s a possibility of the rumor of this coming to fruition based on non-confirmed and anonymous sources.</p>
<p>All we can is that we&#8217;re pretty sure that this might happen some time in the very near or very far future. For now our speculation and wonder will fill the void. </p>
<p>Google is increasingly trying to surprise and surpass their competitors. But be careful not to make this grueling process for users due to the excess. Consumers are not well get used to a version of Android and then comes another oneimmediately. You need time to digest the news.</p>
<p>Will this be the version that eliminates the lagginess?</p>
<p>or the force app closes, or the bugginess</p>
<p>or the force app closes, or the bugginess</p>
<p>good article</p>
<p>&#8220;What we don’t yet know is the version number — in fact, Google has yet to say what Ice Cream Sandwich’s version number will be, much less Jelly Bean’s.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hate, hate, hate how the &#8220;Game changing stuff&#8221; is always delayed. They&#8217;ve been saying that since last year (wait for GB! wait for Ice Cream!)</p>

<p>i predicted this name Jelly Bean months ago, during uStream. check the records to see if im right</p>
<p>Does it really matter if you predicted the name a few months ago?</p>
<p>Hey I predict apples next ipad name is going to be ipad 3. There is on the record now give me teh credit I deserve lol..</p>
<p>I was thinking Jubilee, as in Cherry Jubilee</p>
<p>I BET 100 bucks those ice cream sandwich UI changes<br />
are going to be a rip of microsofts metro UI.</p>

<p>i read this article that Android not only pans to overpower the present market, but also persists to rule the future! And in this desire, they have released the Jelly Bean! but  the speculations are primarily based on the version code of the operating system. <a href="http://radiomobiletech.com/blo.." target="_blank">http://radiomobiletech.com/blo..</a>.</p>

<p>wow, what a name easy to remember and as well as it will make famous, Waiting to see what kind of features there will be. Hopefully google will not disappoint us. </p>
<p>Next name for Android &#8211; Jam</p>
<p>Next name for Android &#8211; Jam</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited. Get this out before the iPhone 5 and they&#8217;ll be getting somewhere. </p>
<p>I hope the next one&#8217;s Key Lime Pie. :D</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a Christmas present no one expected&#8230;</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t agree more. Hopefully Motorola will quickly release to unbranded phones outside America as well.</p>
<p>i am in Europe,  nothing yet. I wouldnt be surprise to get the update after 1-2 months&#8230;</p>
<p>I want to believe that Google loves us and will start having real customer service.</p>
<p>Except this christmas present bricked my phone!  I have an encrypted but unrooted stock phone, and after installing the OTA update last night at midnight it cannot unencrypt my data and is stuck in a boot loop after I enter my password.  Thank Motorola!</p>
<p>Oh, wow. Not like jelly bean and Razrs havent&#8217;t coexisted for months or anything.</p>
<p>Actually, just the HD versions got Jellybean so far.</p>
<p>Unless you custom ROM&#8217;d.<br />
Those were buggy as hell though.</p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>Kudos for Motorola!</p>
<p>Sarcasm? Jelly bean came out in July.</p>
<p>How many phones that came out in 20111 are running 4.1.2 that aren&#8217;t named Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>THAT! Thanks man.</p>
<p>I think that someone pushed the button a little early. It looks like the download isn&#8217;t finishing. Android Central is reporting that the download isn&#8217;t finishing. My wife&#8217;s Razr Maxx isn&#8217;t updating at al..</p>
<p>not finishing here either on my droid razr i . . .hmmmm</p>
<p>Always great to see a device that&#8217;s just a year old getting the latest OS update, just a few months after its release. Congrats you guys.</p>
<p>Latest? I think latest would be 4.2, and it&#8217;s being updated to 4.1&#8230; I mean if it&#8217;s being updated&#8230;</p>
<p>Ah well, at least it&#8217;s updating to a new dessert name, isn&#8217;t it? I guess you can&#8217;t have a year old phone and expect it to run the latest and greatest without having to fiddle with it.</p>
<p>Read this and immediately started frantically pressing the system update button. No update yet, sadly.</p>
<p>I bought the Galaxy Nexus so I could get the official update when it comes out, and the freaking Razr beat me to it!!!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s awesome to be rooted :) Been on 4.1 and newer since this summer and now currently rocking 4.2.1 for the past couple weeks courtesy of AOKP.</p>
<p>Again I said official update..</p>
<p>Ummmm you have jelly bean on there. Though no 4.2 &#8230;. So not sure how your missing this version of jelly bean..</p>
<p>And 4.2 will likely be pushed out in the next couple weeks. The binaries for the Toro(Verizon GNex) were already released if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p>Everything&#8217;s out for the Toro version, there are a bunch of also roms out for it, it&#8217;s just the usual waiting for Verizon to approve it</p>
<p>Aosp, not also</p>
<p>The one being pushed to the Razr is a newer version then the one on the Toro&#8230;</p>
<p>Hmm just strange, asked to update twice, and didnt finish each time&#8230;.this suX (Droid Razr i, Missouri USA)</p>
<p>Has anyone with a Razr Maxx got it yet?</p>
<p>The open non-droid version.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got it&#8230;installed and working. My wifes Razr stopped halfway through. Looks like someone jumped the gun, and then it got pulled. It does work great on my Razr though! Webtop is still there, OTA Rootkeeper worked to keep Root, and Mobile Hotspot still works like it did before. Very responsive and more available RAM being reported :-)</p>
<p>JB update means a JB kernel, which means working CM10 and no rotation bugs or anything! Hallelujah</p>
<p>Rotation bugs were in CM9 too</p>
<p>Its true! the update was available just now and apparently it failed :( they better not be trolling</p>
<p>I tried to copy the update file before it installed on mine, but I couldn&#8217;t find it anywhere even using ES File Explorer with Root access&#8230;</p>
<p>And in case people don&#8217;t believe it&#8230;lol<img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h154/bradleyem/Screenshot_2012-12-24-16-04-41.png" /></p>
<p>I just got notice of the update and tried to fetch it over 4G.  If failed and now my device says it is  up to date  on 4.0.    I tried it over both wifi and 4G. What gives???</p>
<p>hate to say it but someone at motorola screwed up and sent it out then stopped it, razr maxi is not getting the jellybean update&#8230; my dad works for motorola and he said its not coming to the maxx just the maxx hd so if ya want it u gotta buy a new handset&#8230;</p>
<p>If they went this far into development of Jellybean for the Razr/Razr MAXX, that a final build was released, then pulled, you can pretty much guarantee that it will get the update eventually. We may have to wait awhile for the real release. Or, hopefully, someone was able to save the update file before they installed it, so it will become available for download. Since I got the update installed, I&#8217;ll have to look for bugs. Maybe thats why it got pulled, who knows&#8230;..</p>
<p>Well tell your dad thats part of the reason motorola has lost a lot of customers and without customers it will eventually hurt his paycheck.  They shouldn&#8217;t make devices they can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t support.  Tell him that for me , ok?</p>
<p>Pretty new Jelly Bean notification bar, and 349<img src="http://i63.photobucket.com/albums/h154/bradleyem/Screenshot_2012-12-24-17-49-56.png" />MB available RAM&#8230; Used to be only around 200MB with no apps running :-)</p>
<p>Still saying no update available for me&#8230;..</p>
<p>Let me be the first to remind you that you have two clocks on the same damn screen.</p>
<p><img src="http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/yea-fuck-yea.gif" /></p>
<p>Motorola actually doing the right thing? wow</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Christmas miracle!</p>
<p>Im hesitating betwen Razr HD and the HTC One X. I&#8217;m buying next week!<br />
Some user opinions please. Thanks! ;)</p>
<p>Yawn&#8212;I already got my &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221; update on my cellphone nearly a month ago! :)</p>
<p>Is this rolling out east coast to west coast?</p>
<p>Its not rolling out anywhere now&#8230;it was pulled. The push was a mistake.</p>
<p>The good news is its already on XDA&#8230;<br />

<p>Why can&#8217;t Google stop playing footsie with OEM&#8217;s and put all their energy into an Xphone range with Motorola ?</p>
<p>When I got off work I saw that I had an update available. I updated immediately. They update installed. I got home and told my wife update. She tried and it but they error message kept saying they update failed. Jelly bean makes them phone a whole lot smoother. They lag I experienced in their past on the phone on a consistent basis seems gone. Google now is great. One thing I&#8217;ve always admired about their iphone is how smooth they operating system seemed. Since then update their droid razr seems on par.</p>
<p>Bravo Moto!!! Meanwhile my Moto Photon (2011 phone) sits here on 2.3.5 Gingerbread with a locked bootloader that you refuse to unlock so I can&#8217;t even put a custom ROM on it. Screw you moto from all the customers you screwed over on the updates.</p>
<p>Those feelings are shared by a large part of the Android community&#8230;Gingerbread is still the norm for the majority of users!!</p>
<p>Got it two weeks ago on my Atrix HD. Very happy, both with the update and the fact that it happened at all. Now for 4.2&#8230; Though really, I don&#8217;t need it since 4.1 got the Google Now improvements, I use Swype so I don&#8217;t need the gesture keyboard and I don&#8217;t care about lockscreen widgets.</p>
<p>I believe that Android 4.2 is only for the Nexus 4 phone for now. All other phones that were running 4.0.x (&#8220;Ice Cream Sandwich&#8221;) should have gotten or will soon get the 4.1 upgrade.</p>
<p>I just read my post. Auto correction was not my friend on that post. I hope every one understood what I was trying to say.</p>
<p>I like the battery life on the Razr Maxx, but my God I hate this phone. It is the biggest piece of lag-shit I&#8217;ve ever seen. My Galaxy S3 blows it away. We use the Maxx&#8217;s for work, and they&#8217;re average at best.</p>
<p>I have your phone, the 4.1 update fixes a great amount of the lag. After it&#8217;s installed jellybean really does run like butter (hence project butter.) Lol I even grabbed my sisters iphone and tested app times, they were on par with each other!</p>
<p>The lag is gone after the update. You may like the phone better once you receive it. I do. I was thinking about going to an iphone because all the Android phones I have purchased had lag. Since the update I have changed my mind. I I&#8217;m sticking with Android. If my phone runs this good with the specs it has and the jelly bean update. I can only imagine how the newer phone with there up to date specs will run with jelly bean.</p>
<p>on the 24th the HTC One S also got a massive Update with JB and Sense4+<br />
Why is this not newsworthy while the RAZR is?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather spend the extra 50 for a Nexus 7.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather spend the same amount of money for the chinese Ainol Quad Core tablet with IPS HD display and USB 3.0 <a href="http://www.pandawill.com/ainol-novo7-venus-quad-core-tablet-pc-android-41-ips-hd-screen-7-inch-16gb-dual-camera-white-p70965.html" target="_blank">http://www.pandawill.com/ainol-novo7-venus-quad-core-tablet-pc-android-41-ips-hd-screen-7-inch-16gb-dual-camera-white-p70965.html</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you right now&#8230; I ain&#8217;t giving my money to no panda&#8230;</p>
<p>Straining to think of a gag involving Ainol and pandas&hellip;just&hellip;can&rsquo;t&hellip;find..one. Gah!</p>
<p>Apparently everyone wants to make a Nexus 7. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s very compelling without the guaranteed updates though.</p>
<p>yeah, that&#8217;s the main reason why I feel like I should wait for the Nexus 7 successor even if the specs were better (they aren&#8217;t here) but I guess I&#8217;m not as price sensitive as the target market this is aiming at</p>
<p>For the price very impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s dirt cheap. Can&#8217;t complain much. It&#8217;ll help boost the Android tablet marketshare, which in turn will boost the App development.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d partially consider it at $99 as a novelty/beater device. At a $150 price point, no thanks. I really don&#8217;t know why anyone wouldn&#8217;t just save up the $50 difference and get a Nexus 7 instead.</p>
<p>Pricewise it&#8217;s right in between a cheap Chinese tablet and the Nexus 7, and many of those cheap tablets are now available under some of the usual local relabelers (Coby, etc)  Given my past experience with Acer tablets (anyone ever try an A100?)  I wouldn&#8217;t pay the extra money if I wanted a &#8220;just good enough&#8221; tablet.</p>
<p>What about ram?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got 512mb of goat</p>
<p>Except the Nexus 7 feels like something twice its&#8217; price, but this looks right on the money.<br />
What ever happened to being more like Apple, Acer?</p>
<p>And once again, the Android makers flood the market with cheap junk and fragment and dilute the brand.</p>
<p>Thank god.  I&#8217;d hate to have to buy something in a market where there is a stiflingly small number of options.  I&#8217;m capable of making my own decisions, and would rather have too many options than too few.</p>
<p>I rather buy cheap junk then expensive junk. That is, if i would be in the market for a tablet.</p>
<p>It seems the race to the bottom is alive and well.</p>
<p>A pile of crap, fire the VP who designed this crap!</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re Amazon or Google, I don&#8217;t think you can afford to sell a &#8220;budget&#8221; tablet.  They make their money in other ways.</p>
<p>WTF is MediaTek?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been making processors for DVD players for the last decade, and recently branched out into S0Cs for crappy tablets.</p>
<p>Weaksauce.</p>
<p>I wonder how terrible the battery life is. If the original budget Acer Iconia 7&quot; tablet is any indication, it&#8217;ll be south of two hours.</p>
<p>Really? A guaranteed hot mess on arrival.  Lord help the consumer who&#8217;ll purchase this crap-tablet. :-)</p>
<p>Oh yeah boy!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry but&#8230;. <strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!</strong></p>
<p>My &#8220;Check Now&#8221; button is about to give way.</p>
<p>That does nothing. Just wait. One day it will be there.</p>
<p>but it&#8217;s really a lot of fun, just pressing that button until BOOM, it shows the update. So satisfying!</p>
<p>Could take weeks&#8230;</p>
<p>There are ways to force it to find the update. Just delete the data for Google Services Framework, and select Check Now again. It will give you a new place in line, which could be in the front or in the back.</p>
<p>Either way, I&#8217;m not listening to any of you guys. I&#8217;m too busy pressing that button every two minutes or so.</p>
<p>Interesting.  I don&#8217;t have root.  Do I need it?</p>
<p>No man. This is official.</p>
<p>I meant to delete the Google Services Framework data. :P</p>
<p>No, you don&#8217;t.  But just a note here, if you do this, and happened to check the web version of the play store, it won&#8217;t show your device until you use the play store app on your phone again.</p>
<p>Manage Apps &#8211; &gt; Google Services Framework &#8594; Clear Cache</p>
<p>Woo Hoo!  Now if only I had the g-nex I ordered to go with it.</p>
<p>For clearing Google Services Framework? No, just go to Manage Applications, All Applications, scroll down, select Google Services Framework and select Clear data.</p>
<p>It might not work, since Google probably didn&#8217;t start the rollout fully yet. Also, you might run into minor issues with the Play store, so I won&#8217;t recommend doing it unless you know your way around. Though all issues usually get fixed by clearing Play store data multiple times too.</p>
<p>TY. :)</p>
<p>Minor issues like the disappearance of GMail and YouTube from the &#8220;My Apps&#8221; list on the Play store. Nothing severe.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re savvy enough to do this, chances are you&#8217;ve already manually flashed the update.</p>
<p>I just manually flashed the IO zip a week ago. Far too lazy to do this again. :P</p>
<p>Do it.  I was running the I/O for a few weeks and the OTA (after the framework trick) gave my 4.1 phone 4.1.1.</p>
<p>..and that&#8217;s from the I/O rom yeah? Just woke up to this news so backing up etc now.</p>
<blockquote>There are ways to force it to find the update.</blockquote>
<p>this is not the way to force the update. The way to force the update is by installing wu&#8217;s kit so you have fast boot on your computer, (not to root, just to make sure you have fast boot installed and the samsung drivers) and boot your phone from the command line into clockwork. Flash the patch, done:D</p>
<p>all files are posted <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/how-manually-flash-jelly-bean-update-your-galaxy-nexus">here</a>.</p>
<p>if you don&#8217;t have command line experience tho, i would wait.</p>
<p>I said &#8220;force it to FIND the update&#8221;. Big difference. Forcing the update on the phone is exactly what I did (flashed the zip in cwm)</p>
<p>Same, i checked multiple times because of the title. Then read the article and it said &#8220;Going out in the next few days&#8221;. Way to mislead us with the title. It&#8217;s not rolling out now&#8230; It&#8217;s rolling out in a few days.</p>
<p>in fact it is rolling out right now check the google+ post. allso the update.zip 4.1 (i/o version) to 4.1.1 final is alrady avalable on xda devs. <br />
loocks like there ist no update for the 4.0.4 yakju phones at this moment</p>
<p>FYI, if you are rooted <a href="http://blog.talawah.net/2012/07/how-to-manually-ota-update-your-galaxy.html" target="new">you can manually apply the OTA update</a>.  You don&#8217;t even need to connect to a computer.</p>
<p>I predict a buttery smooth roll-out from here.</p>
<p>+1</p>

<p>I usually hate this things.</p>
<p>But I like this one.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>Now I hate myself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the power of the pelican.</p>
<p>I knew you&#8217;d comment on this picture.</p>
<p>Already got it on the Verizon Galaxy Nexus!</p>
<p>OTA orrr custom ROM??</p>
<p>Custom.</p>
<p>Which JB rom are you using? Has it been stable for you?</p>
<p>I am not. I just knew he was. I have a GSM model running the ROM Google gave out at IO.</p>
<p>I have the same ROM and it works flawless. Not a single issue I have found!</p>
<p>I have several. Notification lights come up wrong colours&#8230; radio needs work&#8230; :(</p>
<p>ROM FTW! You will be waiting for months if you expect an OTA</p>
<p>You probably mean for non-Nexus devices.</p>
<p>No, for the Verizon Nexus.</p>
<p>Toro was re-added to the AOSP list&#8230; so it shouldn&#8217;t be long.</p>
<p>For some reason the ToroPlus may take longer though&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>Forgot to add GSM in there. I have the unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexus. ROMs are fine, but the reason I bought it was to stay away from all that (already done enough with my previous Android phone). Official OTAs FTW :)</p>
<p>My entire computing experience will change in sync this month, JB on the GN, NExus 7, Mountain Lion. Best update month EVAR!</p>
<p>Agreed. Mac + Android = the best technological solution IMO.</p>
<p>Android + Linux = what most googlers on the Android Team use so i&#8217;ll take that solution. IMO ofc.</p>
<p>Most of the Google team the public sees use Macs. I have yet to see on with Linux. But hey, what do I know?</p>
<p>Android is linux, and it&#8217;s a hell of a lot easier to build Linux on linux than on OSX.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t automatically mean that that is the solution they use. And just because Linux is easier for the, to dev Android with doesnt mean that is their personal OS choice.</p>
<p>While I am sure there are Googlers that use Linix, I haven&#8217;t seen any. At any rate I&#8217;m transitioning to Android from iOS, (can&#8217;t fully transition until I have a 10&#8217; Nexus tablet.) . But as far as OS X? I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for ANYTHING else on the market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that the no one uses OSX there, and i&#8217;d agree that for personal work a good number of them use OSX. But i&#8217;m saying that for building (like not apps, but the actual OS itself) on linux.  For work on the android team they probably use a Mac that ssh&#8217;s into a linux box where they can build it, or just out right use linux itself.</p>
<p>It is a matter of preference. You can directly build Android on OSX by the way. You don&#8217;t need Linux.</p>
<p>I use Ubuntu as a android user and developer. And Yes, Google uses goobuntu. Not only is a mac OS based on the similar to linux/unix kernel, most macs you see are personal computers used by employees. Mac is a toy compared to a linux based powerful workhorse platform.</p>
<p>Google uses Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goobuntu" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goobuntu</a></p>
<p>they use mac&#8217;s too.</p>
<p>The ThinkPads they use are most probably running Goobuntu.</p>
<p>employees get a choice when they work there&#8230;thinkpad or macbook. they&#8217;re not allowed to run windows on the general network there, so non-macs usually run goobuntu. some macs run goobuntu as well.</p>
<p>I hope you don&#8217;t get burned like you did with your Droid X again.  :)</p>
<p>This is true im learning how to build android apps. They recommend Mac OS X since the file system is similar. You can get around faster. Its a nightmare on Windows.</p>
<p>How is the filesystem similar?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s UNIX.</p>
<p>I know this.</p>
<p>Personally I hate OSX but it is good enough for development. You certainly don&#8217;t have to use Linux to work on a Linux distribution.</p>
<p>You do know that Macs can run Linux, right?  I saw several Android / Google employees running Ubuntu at I/O.</p>
<p>(Not deriding Macs or OS X, I use it daily)</p>
<p>to even further murk the waters, MacPorts, which is awesome.</p>
<p>HomeBrew &gt; MacPorts!!!</p>
<p>Googlers have nothing against Apple <strong>products</strong>.</p>
<p>Googlers salary also comes from ads displayed on Macs (and iOS devices).</p>
<p>Sergey Brin and Lary Page both have a Mac if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>Linux? Nope. OSX? Yes</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used OSX, so I don&#8217;t have an opinion.</p>
<p>You should defiantly try it.</p>
<p>I defiantly (in a defiant manner) tried it and did not like it. Personally I find Windows on Linux distros (with lightweight desktop environments such as XFCE) much more usable.</p>
<p>Auto-correct typo. And Windows anything is just a horrible experience to me. But to each his own.</p>
<p>Sure. There is no point in OS fanboyism. It&#8217;s a matter of taste and I think usually people like an OSjust  because they are used to it. Human beings tend to avoid change.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the same&#8230; but Windows (before 8) is just a horrible experience&#8230; which is why the average user just uses t he browser&#8230; they can&#8217;t figure out shit else in windows lol and OSX isn&#8217;t an option to them becease there is a MASSIVE learning curve if you&#8217;ve never used it</p>
<p>They use Linux, in fact, a Google employee gave a keynote last month on where they use Ubuntu. Turns out, it&#8217;s widely used.</p>
<p>Google employees can either use OS X or Linux. Both OS&#8217;s can compile Android (where Windows can not).</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>More like Windows+Android,  since the majority of Windows users are people who use Android devices and Google services</p>
<p>We were talking about the best combination. Not the most common.</p>
<p>You usually need to install device drivers to use ADB for devices on Windows.</p>
<p>Linux and OS X you have access to the core and you can adb without installing any drivers.</p>
<p>UGH!!! F U SPrint GNex!!!!! GRRRRrrrr!!! Now i have to wait!!</p>
<p>And they said the Verizon G-Nex wasn&#8217;t a Nexus.  Sprint&#8217;s is even less!</p>
<p>Dude&#8230;..thanks&#8230;.LOL Thought i couldnt get anymore down!!!</p>
<p>Look on the bright side, the OTA is gonna happen this month instead of next year for all the GNex&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Dude you have a nexus, you&#8217;re good!</p>
<p>(A fake one)</p>
<p>I dunno about that one. Sprint had Google Wallet from the start. VZW still needs to catch up. They also lagged on the 4.0.4 update. Sprint was on that ASAP.</p>
<p>Google said all GNEX devices by the Month&#8217;s end.  They&#8217;ve got shit rollin&#8217;.</p>
<p>Google Lies at IO</p>
<p>They said that today.</p>
<p>where did they say this? That&#8217;s good news if true, because they have zero control over how long Verizon or Sprint take to test JB&#8230; so if they DID say this today, they must have got the nod from the carriers that the update will be pushed this month.</p>
<p>Nexus Google+ post.  They said &#8220;all&#8221; Galaxy Nexus devices by the end of the month.  We&#8217;ll see what that means&#8230;</p>
<p>Somebody let me know if you get the OTA today on a phone already running the JB release from IO.</p>
<p>Everyone should be getting it. The OTA should be 4.1.1.</p>
<p>Everybody but those poor suckers on VZW.. Oh wait I&#8217;m one of those suckers.  Not too horrible since I put a ROM on the day it OTA&#8217;d for IO &#8230;</p>
<p>nexus s???</p>
<p>Later</p>
<p>Near future.</p>
<p>Fall.</p>
<p>What a pleasant surprise! My RSS feed showed two posts from other sites about 4.1.1 rolling out to the Nexus 7 and I thought this post was the same. Didn&#8217;t read the title thoroughly. Can&#8217;t wait to get this!</p>
<p>Jelly Bean will be the next 7% eating up most of ICS portion of the pie.</p>
<p>So what. This post is about Nexus devices getting the update.</p>
<p>All non-Nexus devices shouldn&#8217;t even follow the Android version numbers. It should just be, TouchWiz 4.0 (Android compatible) or Sense 4.0 (Android Compatible). Because that&#8217;s what they really are.</p>
<p>For minor point releases maybe. For major point releases (like 4.1) not really. There are new APIs and significant changes under the hood and to core components. In terms of user experience maybe that is how they should be labeled, but that is not what version numbers are about.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s a good thing. isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>i wonder how scott forstall will deride jelly bean. (referring to WWDC when he called ICS a &#8220;dairy product&#8221;). not trying to troll or start a flame war, it just kind of stuck with me. kind of like a jelly beans sticking to my teeth.</p>
<p>maybe he&#8217;ll ride up on stage on a green felt pony, wearing a hand-stitched multi-colored patchwork quilt leather sombrero, and throw jelly beans at everyone, yelling how do you like them beans!!? ;-P</p>
<p>hopefully someone grabs the .zip file and uploads it soon, save me waiting for it to hit my device!</p>
<p>Hoping for the same thing here!</p>
<p>CHECK UNIVERSAL SEARCH!!! IF you have the update installed.</p>
<p>Hey guys, just a quick question: Josh said you guys don&#8217;t use the &#8220;royal we&#8221; but it&#8217;s used in this post. Not that I&#8217;m complaining, because I use the royal we when I write my blog posts. Just wondering which side of the issue  you guys have taken.</p>
<p>I think he was referring to reviews and not news pieces</p>
<p>Oh I was referring to this:<br />
<blockquote>we covered</blockquote><br />
In this case, Dieter Bohn did the review, not The Verge staff entirely.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHA! +1</p>
<p>Imagine how much smoother it will rub with project butter!</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m sorry, I just had to make the joke.)</p>
<p>I think that was the joke haha</p>
<p>My thumb is getting bigger every minute just pressing the Check Now button. It&#8217;s just fun.</p>
<p>For non-Nexus owner, expect your update as a Christmas present.</p>
<p>Pretty sure most will just be getting Ice Cream Sandwiches for Christmas :)</p>
<p>Ahhhhh can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>Nexus. S. Now.</p>
<p>Send me the update now, Google! I promise, my first question when trying out the new Google search won&#8217;t be anything related to weather.</p>
<p>Would love to know if/when any one running a JRN84D device received this update&#8230;﻿</p>
<p>Just checked XDA, people with the I/O phones are getting a small update that takes them to 4.11 i think.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1764536&page=6" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1764536&amp;page=6</a> <br />
thats the link where they are discussing it. apparently the update zip is there too if you can/want to do it manually</p>
<p><a href="http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/google_takju/edfff6d328f1.signed-takju-JRO03C-from-JRN84D.edfff6d3.zip" target="_blank">http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/google_takju/edfff6d328f1.signed-takju-JRO03C-from-JRN84D.edfff6d3.zip</a></p>
<p>If we are running the I/O image  of 4.1 and install this 8meg zip from Clockwork Mod Recovery, will it retain all of our settings in JB? Or will it wipe and we have to re-login and start over?</p>
<p>Delta. You will not have a wipe, I believe.</p>
<p>COME.ON.VERIZON</p>
<p>heres the link for all you suckers :P <a href="http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/google_takju/edfff6d328f1.signed-takju-JRO03C-from-JRN84D.edfff6d3.zip" target="_blank">http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/google_takju/edfff6d328f1.signed-takju-JRO03C-from-JRN84D.edfff6d3.zip</a> taken from XDA</p>
<p>this takju 4.1 &gt; 4.1.1 <em>only</em></p>
<p>basically updating the I/O update to 4.1.1</p>
<p>those of us still on a stock 4.0.4 build are not yet in luck. it must be very soon</p>
<p>check my latest post</p>
<p>nice one, so pretty much if you&#8217;re on takju there&#8217;s nothing to stop you updating!</p>
<p>i&#8217;m on yakju. at this point it&#8217;s tempting to flash to takju.. patience.</p>
<p>What about LTE phones?</p>
<p>No</p>
<blockquote>Update: A Google spokesperson has informed us that the company has not pushed out any changes to search functionality in connection with the Jelly Bean update.</blockquote>
<p>Wait, so does that mean no Google Now in the update? I hope this won&#8217;t affect my Nexus 7&#8230;</p>
<p>i havent noticed no search differences. Google Now is still there obviously but the local search is still there too.</p>
<p>Ah cool, I wasn&#8217;t sure what the update implied&#8230; It did seem a bit unlikely that they&#8217;d ship it without Now</p>
<p>They&#8217;re talking about the software update that changes the search functionality, Apple apparently patented a search using multiple databases. Some versions of ICS have been updated to not search multiple databases (play store, web, music library) but results would have to come from one place, the web.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still confused whether &#8220;no change in search functionality in Jelly Bean&#8221; means that no change with respect to the ICS version(which has the older version of voice search, not the new unified one) or with respect to the one introduced at the I/O(the original made voice search, before Apple sued). Or to be simple, does it still have all the search functions introduce at the I/O conference?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kinda what I  was asking and it seems the answer is that its the search introduced at I/O&#8230; I don&#8217;t have one, so I&#8217;m not 100%, but I think that may be the case&#8230;</p>
<p>Still waiting on my Galaxy Nexus to get the update. I&#8217;m running ICS.</p>
<p>Come on, Google!</p>
<p>You have ICS on your Galaxy Nexus? Whoa.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s crazy dude.</p>
<p>No sh*t bro.</p>
<p>It blows my mind every time I read these how there is never a single mention of the Verizon Gnex. How hard is it for the big V to at least acknowledge that Google released a new version that some people might actually want and give some BS train for why it will take 3 extra months to get it on devices? Google&#8217;s similar silence seems like a tacit admission that Verizon is just plain giving them the finger.</p>
<p>well&#8230; there&#8217;s at least this&#8230;.</p>
<p>Jean-Baptiste Queru (Google employee that works on AOSP):</p>
<p>&#8220;As for AOSP on the VZW Galaxy Nexus, it essentially matches the GSM version now. &quot;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always been possible to create custom builds for the VZW Galaxy <br />
Nexus (we&#8217;ve always distributed all the files we could), but from this <br />
point you can expect that they&#8217;ll be easier to develop and that <br />
they&#8217;ll work better in Jelly Bean than they did in Ice Cream Sandwich. &quot;</p>
<p>this could possibly mean Verizon will be faster to update this time around.</p>
<p>The Nexus idea is no carrier branding (well that matches a lot of other phones too), the CDMA ones have carrier branding therefore they are not real nexuses.</p>
<p>Carrier branding is not a problem. Problem is radio, which is carrier-proprietary. That was the only reason why vzw gnex was such a trouble afaik</p>
<p>My point, though, is that even if Google gave Verizon a perfectly functional, bug-free JB build, VZW would still inexplicably delay it. Google can&#8217;t simply push the update to the phones, or even distribute a &#8220;Google-blessed&#8221; ROM for us to load legitimately.  The only option is to unlock the bootloader (and subsequently be frowned upon by Verizon) and load a community-developed ROM. I have done this, and I&#8217;m pretty happy, but that does not forgive Verizon&#8217;s utter lack of regard for consumers.</p>
<p>I know the radio is proprietary which makes it a fake nexus too.</p>
<p>I wonder what the wait will be like for Sprint users. The delay for ICS for the Nexus S 4G was a few months. I could imagine the same for the Nexus S again (still rockin mine), but the same for the Galaxy Nexus would be unacceptable. I recall quite a growing mob of sprint users as the delay continued. Hopefully they get their act together this time around.</p>
<p>6 months.</p>
<p>heres the 4.0.4 &gt; 4.1.1 update zip: <a href="http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/google_takju/5c416e9cf57f.signed-takju-JRO03C-from-IMM76I.5c416e9c.zip" target="_blank">http://android.clients.google.com/packages/ota/google_takju/5c416e9cf57f.signed-takju-JRO03C-from-IMM76I.5c416e9c.zip</a></p>
<p>can anyone vouch for this?</p>
<p>I vouch for this.<br />
Because the file is hosted on google.com and it looks like every other OTA URL ever.</p>
<p>Only works if you&#8217;re running a takju build ;)</p>
<p>I also believe it will work on yakju since they are essentially the same (Takju=Yakju+GWallet) but I cannot say for sure.</p>
<p>Thanks was a bit excited and only glanced at it before downloading.</p>
<p><img src="http://t.qkme.me/352tgr.jpg" /><br />
when yakju? WHEN?</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>is there a way to update with out having to unlock the bootloader? i didnt do it when i got my Galaxy Nexus from the play store and id rather not wipe it if i dont have to.</p>
<p>Just wait for the OTA.</p>
<p>So how do I install? Sorry I&#8217;m new to Android. Just received my GSM Nexus.</p>
<p><strong> OMG SHAKING AND CRYING  ;aslkdfjas;lkdfjals;dkfjals;dkfjas </strong></p>
<p>*clicks &#8220;Check Now&#8221; whilst sobbing inconsolably</p>
<p>Just received my update. Is it just me or is this faster than the preview build.all this was typed with android speech to text. No mistakes were made in the making of this comment :-)</p>
<p>I guess I spoke too soon&#8230; still pretty good though.</p>
<p>Dang, I&#8217;m jealous. Really want the update, mainly for Google Now.</p>
<p>Do you have a yakju or takju galaxy nexus?</p>
<p>Takju</p>
<p>I know I sound like a newb, but how do you tell?</p>
<p>Google Play store GNEX are Takju.</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it sorry but I really need to know my built type</p>
<p>From the XDA forums: Using any file manager app, go into your /system folder and open the file called &#8220;build.prop&#8221;. Find the line that starts with ro.product.name. Whatever comes after the equals sign (=), that&#8217;s the firmware you have.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also easily plug your GNex into any computer and access the files from the device.</p>
<p>Wish the verge would gather some info for Canadian gn users on how its acceptable that our devices are so out of date compared to the rest of the gun variants.</p>
<p>If someone with yakju gets it let us know!</p>
<p>Wiped yakju and installed takju fresh from a factory image and then updated from a zip of the new 4.1 update. Totally worth it, even if I only got it a day or two ahead of time.</p>
<p>my galaxy nexus just got 4.0.4 two days ago. I feel like I&#8217;m the last person with it.  I think 4.1 will take me&#8230;&#8230;mmmmmmm&#8230;&#8230; months</p>
<p>New modem from the I/O build?</p>
<p>OH, and clicking check now never worked for me. I ALWAYS had to wait for OTA unless I installed it manually</p>
<p>I thought a different article mentioned that the way JellyBean executes search skirts around Apple&#8217;s patent, therefore JellyBean phones do not infringe that particular patent. Is that accurate?</p>
<p>In google play it mentioned  US$ 349 = 19 449.3981 in Indian rupees ( INR ) .so  i like to buy this phone. This phone is available in the same rate of RS. 19 449 in INDIA. <br />
PLEASE REPLY&#8230;.</p>
<p>What was the question?</p>
<p>nope. The play store isn&#8217;t selling galaxy nexus in india and samsung has decided not to release it either, because they want everybody to focus on the Galaxy SIII</p>
<p>Its available at 25K &#8211; 26K INR on ebay.in. Its not oficially available in India and I don&#8217;t think it will be made available in near future.</p>
<p>But I love google for supporting Telugu/Kannada/Hindi languages with Jelly Bean. I keep spamming the update button but still no sign of it..</p>
<p>Come hither! come hither, sweetheart!</p>
<p>Has anyone on Yakju got the update yet? At all? I&#8217;m talking coming from 4.0.4, not the IO 4.1 build.</p>
<p>The IO devices were Takju. There is no known Yakju update at this time. Seems Google is rolling out the update to US handsets at the moment, international updates may start any time now. Depends if they&#8217;re being distributed from UK/EU servers, if so the European Google branches need a few hours to organise and roll out the update. Their UK offices have only been open 2 hours at the time of this post so it&#8217;s not an awful long time for them to get everything together. Might start seeing the update hit Yakju devices by this evening or more likely tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Unless they&#8217;re rolling out to a small percentage of users first, seeing if any devices spontaneously combust or tear space-time asunder. Then once everything looks good, roll out en mass. Probably best for a small number of people to experience difficulty rather than everyone.</p>
<p>Not yet. I think i&#8217;ll have to end up waiting a bit longer for the 4.1.1 update because i&#8217;m running a variant of Yakju (Aus version to be exact). Hopefully i won&#8217;t have to resort to manual installations, since 4.0.4 came OTA in May for me.</p>
<p>I wonder when Samsung decides to deliver it to all the builds that aren&#8217;t getting updates straight from Google.</p>
<p>Anyone had the update in the UK yet?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in UK and I haven&#8217;t yet.</p>
<p>Nor me.. :-( &#8211; Waiting on a Nexus 7 too.. the suspense!</p>
<p>Following a thread about the OTA update on xda and at least one person has got it on Vodafone UK via OTA, not manually&#8230;</p>
<p>HOW DO I KNOW MY FREAKING BUILD TYPE???</p>
<p>download &#8220;Android System Info&#8221; from the Play Store. In the app go to System &#8212;&gt; BuildInfos. If it&#8217;s yakju it should say google under Brand and yakju under Product</p>
<p>Must suck to have a fake one right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/2FKMW"><img title="Hosted by imgur.com" src="http://i.imgur.com/2FKMW.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Woo! Grabbed the Yakju update from XDA/Google because I&#8217;m impatient.  This is VERY smooth.</p>
<p>Fuck my fucking life. I&#8217;m yakjuzs.. I&#8217;ll never get the update :&#8216;&#8217;&#8217;(</p>
<p>Unlock the bootloader and flash a takju build.  It&#8217;s so <em>easy </em>on the Galaxy Nexus.  The hardest part is probably getting the drivers installed in Windows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Mac and I suck at rooting I still don&#8217;t know how to do it&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a forum that details every instruction on how to do ANYTHING to the Galaxy Nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t grade 3 anymore, I&#8217;m not going to spoon feed you.  You might actually have to read for 30 minutes before you go flashing your phone.</p>

<p>On mac, you need to either copy adb and fastboot to your /bin/ directory or cd to where you put the files and then call them using ./adb and ./fastboot in terminal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry but I&#8217;m a big big big noob at this stuff so I&#8217;m still confused like writing stuff in the terminal and stuff</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Mac and I hate my life</p>
<p>Should be at America to receive the update in first place? huh? When at Europe?</p>
<p>the update  is rolling out globaly <br />
i got mine 3 hours ago here in germany</p>
<p>so jealous&#8230;. so so very jealous&#8230;<br />
I have yakju ordered from UK but used on T-Mobile here in the USA.<br />
Cant stop restarting my phone and &#8216;check now&#8217;</p>
<p>Have you got a Yakju or Takju phone? My phone is Yakju and no sign of update till now! I envy you.</p>
<p>Yakju and Takju are basically the same apart from Google Wallet.</p>
<p>After tireless hits of the &#8220;Check Now&#8221; button for a couple of days&#8230; got the Jelly Bean update for my lovely Galaxy Nexus, Right Now! (Denmark) Can&#8217;t say how much I&#8217;m excited. :-) Its buttery smooth! I never imagined it would get this smooth and this responsive. I loved my phone previously, now i&#8217;m simply mad with it.</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for this post, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought a thing about this. I would&#8217;ve gone along with my week and some day a wonderful surprise would be waiting for me in the status bar. But no. Now i&#8217;m all anxious checking my phone over and over yearning for JB. Damn you!!</p>
<p>Totally agree, would have been a better day without all the &#8220;check now&#8221; button pushing. I thought the reason I bought an unlocked hspa variant straight from google would mean I&#8217;d be getting this shit first!</p>
<p>Lol &#8211; you are getting it first! they dont&#8217; send it too all devices the same instant. they spread it out over a week or so, but it&#8217;s still months before anyone else will get it. <br />
We&#8217;re just a little too crazy about it!</p>
<p>what about the people with CDMA Nexus S 4G?<br />
i think i&#8217;ll have to rely on ROMs from now on. HURRY UP CM10</p>
<p>Google does not care about CDMA people.</p>
<p>Day 2, still no update on my Nexus from the Play Store.  I guess I need to just accept that I probably won&#8217;t have the update by the weekend.<br />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lj7deakZuh1qbg6y3.gif" /></p>
<p>Will this update come to a GSM Galaxy Nexus with yakjuux (4.0.1) with this rollout?</p>
<p>Dude, yakjuux is 4.0.4 already i think. It eill come nonetheless, but if you are 4.0.1 something is wrong</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, my phone won&#8217;t get the update. I think I may have to unlock the bootloader and manually do it, I&#8217;m not very good at that stuff though.<br />
Ugh!</p>
<p>unlock the bootloader and flash takju, youll get the update then.</p>
<p>there are plenty of instructions on XDA: <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1366806" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1366806</a></p>
<p>Well, my main issue is I have yakjuux not yakju. Can I still go straight from yakjuux to takju?<br />
My bootloader is now unlocked btw.</p>
<p>Nevermind, I just now put takju on it. Just waiting for Jelly Bean now. <br />
Thanks for the help!</p>
<p>you can put jellybean on right now if you want to do it manually :) <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1764536" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1764536</a></p>
<p>How do I install it?</p>
<p>Nevermind, just saw the thread. Thanks!</p>
<p>After refresh spamming it finally came through.  Thank the Based God!</p>
<p>which version were you running?! yakju or takju from play store?</p>
<p>Takju from the Play Store</p>
<p>Yup, 48 hours after this post and I&#8217;m running 4.1.1, yakju Galaxy Nexus, Vodafone UK.</p>
<p>Just got my update. GSM unlocked yakju (dallas,tx)</p>
<p>Still no update&#8230;Does it always take this long to roll out an update?</p>
<p>Got it an hour ago. I&#8217;m running Takju from the Play Store.</p>
<p>I bought a GN in The Netherlands but live in Germany. Checked for an update endlessly in DE to no avail. Crossed the border today, checked for an update once and voila. Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Totally in love with my phone again.</p>
<p>Yes, its finally here!</p>
<p>way to go HTC</p>
<p>I have the Evo 3D and it was painful waiting for official ICS. I was on custom roms to escape most of the lack of updates, however these devices still rely pretty heavily upon final builds of the skinned roms for proper drivers and kernels to be ported to the custom roms. I am defiantly picking my next Android phone based off of the previous history of updates, and right now thats coming down to a Nexus device or a Samsung.</p>
<p>I had an EVO 3D also.  I hated the fact that the phone was a clunker and I should have waited.  I ended up getting a Galaxy S III and I can tell you from my experience, it is a far superior phone than anything I&#8217;ve ever had and it&#8217;s everything I&#8217;ve ever wanted in an Android phone.  It&#8217;s light, battery doesn&#8217;t need charging in the middle of the day (and i&#8217;m a heavy data user) and it&#8217;s just fun to use for everything.</p>
<p>Take my advice:  Get a Galaxy S III.  You won&#8217;t be sorry.</p>
<p>For the first time Samsung updates it phone to a new version Android before HTC. but I guess Samsung fanboys well go all over HTC right now&#8230;..</p>
<p>You&#8217;re joking, right?</p>
<p>I read an article a few months ago, in the US it seems HTC is the best company to update devices. I think that&#8217;s what he was talking about. It may not be the first time, but overall, HTC had a better update record.</p>
<p>Ignoring global updates to support an argument, I see&#8230; :)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about global updates. It could still be the same. I googled for this info for a while, but there is no comparison yet. If you find one, I&#8217;d be interested.</p>
<p>Of course you don&#8217;t. But you know about late US updates, and is apparently upset about it.</p>
<p>Everyone with the tiniest interest in US Samsung updates know that it&#8217;s the US carriers delaying the updates, not Samsung.</p>
<p>We get our updates very quickly here in Australia, months and months before the US gets them let alone the Samsung product. We have had the Galaxy S111 4G for over a month now :)</p>
<p>Whats with the irritated  tone, I didnt say HTC is better&#8230; Quit being such a Samsung fanboy. Btw, the discussion is about updates to unlocked versions of the phones. And I think no manufacturer deserves praises on this aspect.</p>
<p>Android vs Android!! Stop the madness!!</p>
<p>I remember getting the Gingerbread update on my HTC Evo 4G in a fair amount of time.  I&#8217;m assuming because the SII and SIII were big sellers and with the new Iphone launch there had to be  some pressure to get these out.</p>
<p>Now the question is do the carriers give a crap or not if these get out quickly? Especially the ones that carry the Iphone.</p>
<p>No actually he is right</p>
<p>Not about the international versions though.</p>
<p>true, but when when the country you live in isn&#8217;t getting it you kind of don&#8217;t care that others are.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s only for the flagship model. The others are usually forgotten.</p>
<p>One X will be updated in October. See MoDaCo&#8217;s inside tip. So it&#8217;s just 2-3 weeks head start for the S3.</p>
<p>Right, so nothing official from HTC, just an &#8220;insider tip&#8221; from PocketPC POS site whose claim to fame was having an extremely disorganized app store for Windows Mobile and Palm OS in the 2000s. Great.</p>
<p>MoDaCo is not related to Pocket pc&#8230; The fact that you dont know who he is desqualifies your post&#8230;</p>
<p>Meanwhile HTC&#8230;..good to see the S2 being supported and not given a value pack.</p>
<p>ICS on the S2 and S3 are two different animals.</p>
<p>Yeah, the skin is different, but it isn&#8217;t a value pack, it&#8217;s literally Jelly Bean with every new feature JB introduced.</p>
<p>HTC updated before Samsung up until now, HTC still have a far better track records.</p>
<p>Maybe Galaxy Music is the Galaxy Players but they couldn&#8217;t be bothered to write out the 5+ screen sizes?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my suspicion, but we&#8217;re waiting to hear back from Samsung for confirmation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/products/galaxy-music/6196" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/products/galaxy-music/6196</a></p>
<p>That is a really confusing lineup. Wow, i can only imagine how average joe feels if a samsung lineup</p>
<p>You mean for the guys and gals that are tech-savvy enough to check a tech blog about upcoming changes to their phone but for some reason can&#8217;t read the packaging on their phone to figure out which from the Galaxy range they have?</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t believe anyone who&#8217;d visit a site like this wouldn&#8217;t spend the ten minutes necessary to run one of the far superior third-party ROMs out there. My old original Galaxy has been on Jellybean most of the year&#8230;</p>
<p>Depends on the device. For things like Samsung&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not a big deal. For HTC owners, you spend forever and a day just trying to get S-OFF.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that just the truth.  You can use their warranty invalidating Bootloader unlocking tool only to find that you have to do a wire trick and burn an sd card in order to (maybe) get s-off.   What the hell was HTC thinking?</p>
<p>My Droid charge doesn&#8217;t have a functioning Jellybean ROM, or even ICS for that matter so I&#8217;m stuck on Gingerbread.  The closest there is happens to be an ICS rom that doesn&#8217;t support data (which is my primary use on the phone).</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe someone who reads the Verge cannot figure out that XDA ROMs won&#8217;t solve every single problem. For the JB ROM to be stable, the developers need the updated drivers for the various hardware components within the phone. Unless there is a developer reference device out there using the same chipset and running JB, they won&#8217;t be able to pull a dump of the OS image and recreate it for the target device. The best they can do without official drivers is to rebuild the kernel from the source, which is extremely time-intensive and still likely to be full of bugs. It wasn&#8217;t a big deal to move from Froyo to Gingerbread, but for phones that launched with GB and didn&#8217;t get upgraded, most devs have struggled to get a working ICS build without native drivers.</p>
<p>D&#8217;oh! One of the reasons I went for HTC One X was because Samsung were notorious with version updates.  Seems I got that one wrong :-(</p>
<p>It seems they have finally realized that continued software support tomorrow will sell phones today.</p>
<p>I have 5 coworkers that just bought a galaxy s2 just because they have the latest updates.  100$ at 10$/mo</p>
<p>LOL! Obviously you haven&#8217;t heard about HTC&#8217;s track record. I had a HTC Desire which HTC swore would be updated to gingerbread. Then it was taken back. Then the taking back was taken back. Then another backflip. Then another, ad nauseum.</p>
<p>Same with the Desire HD. ICS update cancelled due to non-existant reason.</p>
<p>Unless you live in Poland I think you are calling it a little early.</p>
<p>The heard the criticism and made fundamental changes to their approach with Touchwiz. It&#8217;s not about framework, it&#8217;s about being able to drop it on top of the OS and have it just work. Basically the complete opposite of what HTC opted for.</p>
<p>One X update is announced for October, not officially, but from a reliable source. I guess it&#8217;s a bit funny to say bad things about HTC for just 2-3 weeks delay. Just consider that Samsung released a Nexus this year with Jelly, it&#8217;s obvious they had a head start in developing it for the S3&#8230;</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t at all. Don&#8217;t buy into that crap. The Nexus team build a solid generic phone. The Flagship team didn&#8217;t see JB until the rest of the OHA got their hands on it, which was about a week before CyanogenMod got their hands on it and look at how long they&#8217;ve had CM10 (JB) running on the S3 and its variants.</p>
<p>Interesting. How do you know this for sure? Samsung has some influence with Google, unless you have solid inside information, I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know for sure. But in all the interviews regarding Nexus devices, this has been the rhetoric. Why wouldn&#8217;t I believe it?</p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a difference between official statements and reality. If they had thedev kit and did not use it unofficially, they&#8217;d be stupid, imho.</p>
<p>This is the same reasoning i had for finally deciding on the GS3.  I&#8217;m on Sprint so I figured the GS3 would get updates since it&#8217;s the same across all carriers versus the LTEVO being specifically tweaked for Sprint.</p>
<p>So these updates really do affect people decisions.  I thought it was always just something used to argue against android as a whole.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for Jelly Belly for my Note 10.1! :D</p>
<p>They&#8217;re updating almost all new devices, wow!</p>
<p>See &#8211; updating your phones is much easier if you are not owned by Google. No, wait, what?!<br />
<em>[Sent from my Motorola Defy+]</em></p>
<p>Already installed. If you tried the latest beta FW this one won&#8217;t surprise you.</p>
<p>The update is so seamless that I can&#8217;t find the &#8216;easy mode&#8217; widgets..</p>
<p>Interesting list, I&#8217;m not a Samsung fan to say the least but kudos to them for updating all those phones!</p>
<p>But if I&#8217;m not mistaken, all those low end models like the Mini 2 and the Ace Plus are still on gingerbread as of now? Weird that they&#8217;ll see Jelly Bean then&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, if that&#8217;s true even my moms phone will be updated to JB, and it&#8217;s very low-end.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame the Galaxy Tab 7.7 Isn&#8217;t getting the update but the 10.1 is.</p>
<p>The article says  Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, not  Galaxy Tab 10.1 which is what I have… No Jellybean for me, not even ICS yet.</p>
<p>My old ass xoom got jellybean awhile ago.</p>
<p>If the Mystery device getting Jelly Bean is the Galaxy S I,  I will flip the freak out. I know it won&#8217;t happen&#8230;..but if it did..if it did&#8230;&#8230;MAN, I&#8217;d lose it. I hope I&#8217;m not near a table because it might flipped.</p>
<p>SGS is perfectly capable of running JB so I don&#8217;t see why not. :)</p>
<p>If the SGS jumped to Jellybean, it would have been supported for 5 OS versions which is unheard of. Like the Nexus series, it got supported for 3 versions.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a little sad a company gets praises for updating your phone. It should go without saying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a question of whether you consider the jump an &#8220;update&#8221;, like a service pack for Windows, or a &#8220;new version of the OS&#8221;, like Vista to Win7&#8230;</p>
<p>I tend to think of it as the latter, so for the SGS2 to get both updated to both 4.0 and 4.1 is pretty darn generous/remarkable.</p>
<p>and it&#8217;s for free ! you don&#8217;t get windows 8 for free if you already have a pc running windows 7 or xp.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about Android, but Apple gives iOS away &#8220;for free&#8221; (of course you pay for development by buying an iPhone) in order to make money with devices.</p>
<p>But i&#8217;m not saying they should give it away for free, i&#8217;m saying they should make it available. If i bought a pc with Vista preinstalled, i could but Win7 and install it myself. They could at least sell a new version of Android if one is available. I don&#8217;t want to be forced to buy a new phone in order to get a new OS. I can understand if older phones are not supported, but if i bought a non-Nexus phone with ICS now, i wouldn&#8217;t know if i&#8217;d get Jelly Bean in the near future.</p>

<p>Minus all the Goolge features that make Android good.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.im/gapps" target="_blank">http://goo.im/gapps</a><br />
Free.</p>
<p>Free as in pirated?</p>
<p>No, they are the Google Apps (GMail, Play etc)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure Google don&#8217;t want people using them without their approval.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/05/12/google-android-skyhook-lawsuit-motorola-samsung/" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2011/05/12/google-android-skyhook-lawsuit-motorola-samsung/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Google maintains tight control over its OEM partners by restricting access to apps like Gmail, Maps, and Market with a strict license agreement that hinges on Android compatibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only for OEMs. Google does let custom ROMs go free with no penalty.</p>
<p>Google themselves made the gapps package for ROM users that still wanted the Google services while still being able to use their handset as they see fit</p>
<p>Then why did Google kick up a fuss about LG (was it LG?) having Google apps on their Android fork?</p>
<p>Mind you, the Google Apps can only be used on certified devices. However, once it is a certified device, it does not matter if it is rooted or has a custom ROM.</p>
<p>Forking Android isn&#8217;t allowed by Open Handset Alliance members, <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/oha_faq.html">it&#8217;s in the FAQ</a>. LG could fork Android but they would be forfeiting their OHA membership, and losing Google support.</p>
<p>But those ROMs aren&#8217;t members of the OHA, so why do Google provide them the apps?</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Google_Apps">this wiki page</a> about Google Apps. Seems to be what Force Close said above, that the mirrored copies are repackaged so that they can be installed on officially certified devices.</p>
<p>Interesting, I didn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p>Yes it is allowed, and no it isn&#8217;t &#8220;in the FAQ&#8221;. Most OEMs have forked Android, but their forks are 100% compatible and pass the certification tests.</p>
<p>No, they certainly didn&#8217;t. Those packs are assembled by users who rip them from stock roms and then package them up, resign GoogleBackupTransport.apk (hopefully, otherwise it won&#8217;t work) and upload them to goo.im.</p>
<p>The best thing to do, really, is to get a device that has official support from Cyanogenmod. Then you&#8217;ll always get fairly timely updates until such time as it&#8217;s no longer reasonable on your hardware. I&#8217;m already running a reasonably solid CM10 Jelly Bean build. I&#8217;m glad to see my phone (The S II Skyrocket/LTE) named in this thread, as official builds might provide some extra optimizations and help kill any remaining bugs, but for the most part I&#8217;m taken care of already.</p>
<p>Think about it, Samsung may also be updating all the phone currently in america, bcuz they dont ko the outcome of their pending lawsuit. So why not make everything available in their roster marketable until they know better&#8230;.</p>
<p>The recent 215 mb update via Kies should tell you something :)</p>
<p>Eyes on Motorola.</p>
<p>The interesting part is that they are updating the low end phones for the first time (some of them will even jump from GB to JB).</p>
<p>galaxy music? Maybe Samsung just lost track of all their phone&#8217;s names.</p>
<p>or maybe they leaked something accidentally?</p>
<p>The iOS-6-remark was really unnecessary. CyanogenMod hat &#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; a long time ago&#8230;</p>
<p>Most of the touted android features were already in jailbroken form before on iOS &#8230; your point being?</p>
<p>If you say it, it&#8217;s gotta be true!</p>
<p>I hear somebody has released Google Maps for jail broken iphones.<br />
When will Android phones get Google Maps?</p>
<p>I heard someone released Android 5 for jailbroken iphones. Google are so far behind the real nerd community.</p>
<p>Obviously they were, jailbreakers take the best.</p>
<p>:D plan-9 bunny</p>
<p>Yeah! Like pull down notifications, right? Even though the developer admitted he released it a long time after Android showed off the feature.</p>
<p>&#8220;and a &#8216;blocking mode&#8217; that sounds remarkably similar to Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Do Not Disturb&#8217; function&#8221;</p>
<p>Trolling much?</p>
<p>Because Apple invented the &#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; concept.</p>
<p>The SGS3 has had it since it got released if I&#8217;m not mistaken? Along with the busy sms of course.</p>
<p>Trolling? I&#8217;m not sure you understand what that word means.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you do, but look it up again. It applies well here, surprisingly.</p>
<p>I hope Verizon gets into the wagon soon&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Blah blah blah&#8230;.Ive had mine soo long its old to me..(jellyBean)!! America is supposed to be so advanced but dammnit, moves to slow&#8230;I purchased the international version and got it not long after it jumped off for  9300&#8230;.BTW&#8230;SHHHH, I bet we&#8217;ll see a new nexus for the holidays&#8230;..</p>
<p>I got a headache reading this.</p>
<p>I thought it was just me.</p>
<p>So how will this update work? Will the phone get a notification or do you have to continually plug into Kies and hope for the best?</p>
<p>All you gave to do is hit &#8216;about&#8217; in settings. I just did, took 5 minutes, and now to see whether it was a good move&#8230;</p>
<p>Dont do it!</p>
<p>If you like the way your SIII works, just leave it alone. You could risk ruining it! I upgraded my Skyrocket from the default Touchwiz to a ICS update and it totally ruined my experience. The phone is way slower,  CRASH ALL THE TIME and is less intuitive than it used to be. Ex: I used to be able to edit an item on my calendar now that&#8217;s not an option.  Ex2: Sometimes I hit the power button on the phone to wake it up and the lock screen for me to enter my password missing so I have to restart the phone just to start using it!</p>
<p>Samsung updates can be really shitty! Just a word of caution.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know this happened with Android. However, it&#8217;s the same thing with iOS. iOS 5 completely ruined the 3GS, and now I guess iOS 6 is ruining the experience for non-Americans..</p>
<blockquote>iOS 5 completely ruined the 3GS</blockquote>
<p>This myth never dies I guess&#8230;</p>
<p>Are you kidding? Had you ever actually used phone, you&#8217;d be aware what a POS it was. Awful lag and daily crashes of Safari, even with all extra stuff disabled. There&#8217;s a thread about this in Apple forums that is like +100 pages long.</p>
<p>Had I ever? I guess over 2 years of daily use would give me some credit but maybe that&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s currently running iOS 6 without a problem (apart from the store redesign&#8230; fail). iOS 5 also ran without a problem. <br />
What&#8217;s more likely, me having a special edition 3Gs or you talking nonsense?</p>
<p>So true.  So true.  iPhone 3GS has likely seen its last update with iOS 6, but given the performance boost that iOS 6 has given to my 4S I would not be surprised if iOS 6 does even better than iOS 5 at improving performance on the iPhone 3GS.</p>
<p>The 3GS is god awful with iOS 6, granted it is better than iOS5, but still horrible.</p>
<p>Is it? My 3GS is noticeably slower with iOS 6 despite it adding virtually nothing to the phone.</p>
<p>iOS 5 was brilliant on the iPhone 3GS.  So much better than iOS 4 was.  I accepted the iOS 4 speed reduction from iPhone OS 3 because it was just a new version running on older hardware.  I was blown away by the performance boost that iOS 5 gave to my iPhone 3GS.  I almost cancelled my iPhone 4S pre-order after upgrading, but I wanted the better camera too badly.  iOS 6 improves performance on the iPhone 4S as well according to recent benchmarks.</p>
<p>After all the lawsuit bad PR, I doubt Samsung would push a buggy update to it&#8217;s flagship device . . . They need all the customer goodwill they can get.</p>
<p>I updated my S2 to ICS and it worked way better than it used to. Of course, I used like for a day before going back to CM9, but still.</p>
<p>So they are updating all of those?   This couldn&#8217;t possibly be the result of the lawsuit&#8230;.  Maybe they have a touchwiz that looks and acts less like whatever nonsense that they were supposed to be  infringing and the updates change that.</p>
<p>Take it easy on that cool aid.</p>
<p>IF they were updating to circumvent Apple ridiculous claims, they wouldn&#8217;t have to change the whole OS, would they? Just fix whatever details they felt were necessary, like the clock icons, for instance&#8230;</p>
<p>The oldest device they are updating is the Galaxy S II, first released Jul. 31, 2011.</p>
<p>I gut mine June 1 2011 though&#8230;</p>
<p>got&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>please get an edit function on this forum</strong></p>
<p>So&#8230; you didn&#8217;t gut your phone?</p>
<p>That was later&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m already on Jelly Bean, but the official support would be awesome.</p>
<p>I am sticking to nexus branded devices &#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s like an iPhone user saying they are going to stick to iPhone devices.</p>
<p>Galaxy Ace didn&#8217;t even get ICS, and it&#8217;s only like 6 months older than Galaxy Ace Plus. But whatever. Hopefully all these phones will also get the <strong>next</strong> 2 versions of Android.</p>
<p>Probably not. JB is already good enough smoothness wise, now we just need more consistency.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>The next two versions of Android will (probably) come this winter and next summer. I sure as heck hope the GS3 at least will get both of those.</p>
<p>Anyone in Canada getting this yet?</p>
<p>So much for Samsung.</p>
<p>Poland?</p>
<p><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=poland" target="_blank">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=poland</a></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. Obviously I didn&#8217;t know Poland was a country.</p>
<p>Google has 2 research/dev offices in Poland. ICS was released in Poland first as well. <br />
Why so surprised &#8211; go and see polish online banking sites and other stuff to realize that in some areas Poland is like 2 generations ahead of most &#8216;western economies&#8217;</p>
<p>Hey, relevant information! Did not know either of those two facts about Poland, now I see it.</p>
<p>hahahaha.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Relay isn&#8217;t on that list and it just launched last week&#8230;</p>
<p>You heard it here first folks Apple invented Do Not Disturb.</p>
<p>I need to make a list of writers who&#8217;s articles I should just totally ignore.</p>
<p>Can the Verge let us make a list of commenters whom we can ignore?</p>
<blockquote>&#8230;and a &#8216;blocking mode&#8217; that sounds remarkably similar to Apple&#8217;s &#8216;Do Not Disturb&#8217; function.</blockquote>
<p>He never said that Apple invented it, but simply provided reference for anybody wondering what &#8220;blocking mode&#8221; was.  How dare he mention Apple!  They are evil!  Evil, I say!!!!!</p>
<p>why there is Gnex photo?:D I am pretty sure to be running JB for few months now&#8230; :)</p>
<p>I mean, it is samsung, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Half a year after Google released Jelly Bean&#8230; that&#8217; s what i call lame</p>
<p>The update from ICS to JB is not as big from GB to ICS.</p>
<p>JB has very few new features.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t make it any better, it makes it worse</p>
<p>Well, it means you can still happily live with ICS.</p>
<p>Half a year? Google released JB at Google IO, which was the end of June. Missed first grade maybe?</p>
<p>But he excelled in the trolling class.</p>
<p>I think there was a phone with a smooth, stable operating system released last weekend&#8230;</p>
<p>Agreed, the Razr I is a really nice phone.</p>
<p>Ah yes, that one with the extra row of icons, right?</p>
<p>I think it got lost somewhere.</p>
<p>Glad to see another Galaxy Victory fan!<br />

<p>Polandball can into jelly bean.</p>
<p>Some people on this site forget that the average joe hates updates. Viewing facebook after the iOS 6 update you wouldn&#8217;t believe the amount of people complaining. &#8220;OMG, 1 hour to update&#8221;. (yes, i did consider unfriending all offenders)</p>
<p>eyes on att</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting here for the Brazilian updates.</p>
<p>This is why HTC, LG and Motorola are all failing. Motorola is the worst of them with their 2011 phones. They made this big announcement about &#8220;ICS or $100 credit&#8221; and then backtrack and say the offer&#8217;s good for the US only. At the same time, they release an ICS schedule for a number of 2011 phones, and then backtrack again. Remember the 2011 Atrix 4G, the so-called future of phones with its shitty laptop dock? Still on Gingerbread. Atrix 2 may well face the same fate. Droid RAZR onwards might survive, but they&#8217;re not even a year old, so hurray for that.</p>
<p>This is good from Samsung and will carry goodwill with their customers.  Its also good that JB is a minor update to ICS which means containing the upgrade is easier for manufacturers.  Anybody who put out a phone that supports ICS should have no excuse in not supporting JB.  Since JB should be less hardware intensive due to Project Butter, then older hardware should run better on it.  The only reason a manufacturer can give for not offering the upgrade is not wanting to invest any money on their end in supporting a phone you already bought because they want you to buy a new phone.</p>
<p>As a Galaxy S Advance owner I&#8217;m glad the phone isn&#8217;t forgotten, it&#8217;s actually my favourite of all the phones I&#8217;ve had.</p>
<p>Just keep hitting check for updates&#8230;.how long can this continue?  Help me!!</p>
<p>There are a lot of indirect good results like.<br />
1. Competition will be forced to update their phones<br />
2. Most of the Samsung phones share a lot of similar hardware, so expect some more phones which are not in this list can get get update from XDA guys, as it&#8217;ll be easier to fork the upadte rom for other similar phones.<br />
3. I these phones can be able to bring up at level where they can be updated for JB which is good jump. Then I&#8217;m sure some of them can also be pushed into next version of Android.<br />
4. Some good rom&#8217;s to study, which might solve some existing problems of some of the custom built roms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited, 5 of my phones will get updated.  :)</p>
<p>So basically nobody can tell when a specific model will be updated. Whats the news?</p>
<p>No JB for Galaxy Tab 7.7?? But yet the crappy 7.0 gets it?   Are you s#!t&#8217;n me Samsung?</p>
<p>Yay, the Samsung Galaxy S II will get the update.</p>
<p>So, when they say Galaxy SII, does that mean just the international version or are all the versions (US carriers) on track to get the update anytime soon?<br />
That&#8217;s pretty important.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what versions it means.  I&#8217;d say it is likely that all versions would get it.  Starting with the GT-I9100, then the other models like the GT-I9100M, GT-I9100P, GT-I9100G, etc..  The international model is a guarantee though.  And I have the international model (the GT-I9100M is just a &#8220;special&#8221; model for some Canadian carriers that is locked down.  It has the exact same specs, and can use the non-locked down international firmware which labels the device as a GT-I9100, or my carriers firmware which labels it as a GT-I9100M.), so I will be able to safely and comfortably flash that new firmware when it is available.</p>
<p>Hard to believe. The original Galaxy S does not get a ICS update because it&#8217;s just a Single Core 1000Mhz with just 512Mb Ram.  That&#8217;s what Samsung said&#8230; Just checked the galaxy mini 2 specs. Single Core 800Mhz with just 512Mb Ram and this phone will get a Jb Update? HAH?!</p>
<p>And this, people, is why everyone should get an unlocked nexus.</p>
<p>To those in the states, save a lot of money by buying unlocked and then going prepaid. The contracts are cheaper too&#8230;</p>
<p>Going on 3 months later and Vodafone New Zealand user are <strong>still</strong> waiting.<br />
Samsung&#8217;s response to enquiries has been &#8220;Unfortunately release plans for this update have not yet been confirmed&#8221;</p>
<p>Last Samsung handset ever.</p>
<p>by 2014 maybe 5% will have it</p>
<p>Ohhh hahahahaha&#8230;.. <strong>kneeslapper</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting on 4.0.2 or 4.0.4 for my Galaxy Nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>Trying turning off airplane mode.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost impossibly easy to update the GN yourself.</p>
<p>And yet, so very few have done it.</p>
<p>Mostly because they don&#8217;t actually care enough to update, or they love to complain online.</p>
<p><img src="http://static.stuff-review.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/galaxy-nexus-clear-4-0-4-ota-update-install-0304.png" /></p>
<p>Precisely why I find Silver Arrow&#8217;s comment hard to believe.</p>
<p>Apparently, carrier-locked Galaxy Nexii sold in Canada have yet to receive the update. But again, it&#8217;s impossibly easy to do yourself.</p>
<p>can you point to a guide? or where to download 4.0.4?</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1626895" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1626895</a></p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; impossibly easy&#8230; Only 5 steps&#8230;</p>
<p>With <em>literally</em> 31 sub-steps.</p>
<p>Impossibly easy.</p>
<p>Settings → About phone → System Update → Download<br />
That&#8217;s it. <br />
The instructions above are for flashing a different ROM not an update.</p>
<p>The Canadian carriers haven&#8217;t released. So, no. That won&#8217;t work. Read. The. Comments.</p>
<p>Actually, it is VERY simple to get the updates.  All you have to do is download and install the drivers from Samsung, then change your build &#8212; probably yakuxw which is the Samsung Canadian build &#8212; to the official Google build which is yakju.  This does not involve rooting of any kind.  Within minutes you should start getting the updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed people complain about this.  It&#8217;s very easy to do.</p>
<p>Which is it? the 31 steps, what yaotly said with his few steps or what you said? Write down how many steps is required to change build.  And everyone is going it&#8217;s so easy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re talking about regarding 31 steps.  After making sure to back-up your phone, these are the steps 1) download and install the Samsung drivers from the Samsung mobile website 2) download and install the official Google build of ICS (yakju). Reboot your phone.   Done.  It could not be more simple.</p>
<p>This requires NO rooting.  You&#8217;re just putting on the actual Google build of ICS&#8230; you know, the one that gets updates from Google, not Samsung?</p>
<p>What ever happened to buying a product and just using it out of the box and work how it is promised?? Was it in the manual that said:  Galaxy Nexus will get all the latest updates if you go find and install it yourself it&#8217;s really easy.</p>
<p>Listen, I&#8217;m not sure what to tell you.  The Canadian Galaxy Nexus owners who have not received updates were not promised anything by anyone and the phone did/do work out of the box.  So your assumption someone has been wronged in some terrible way has no basis in reality.</p>
<p>If Canadian owners of Galaxy Nexus want to receive the very regular updates directly from Google over the air they have two choices 1) do something about and procure the actual Google build or 2) do nothing other than whine and complain in various forums.</p>
<p>There is not much else to say/write.</p>
<p>Just download the Galaxy nexus toolkit it does all the steps for you. you tell it what you have and what you want and it makes it happen.</p>
<p>Point is, this shouldn&#8217;t be something the average consumer has to do to update. Updating should not take 44 steps. That&#8217;s why Android is for geeks, not consumers. I&#8217;ll admit it, I quite enjoy ICS on my touchpad (dreaded 2.3) but it seriously is a beta product not made for consumers.</p>
<p>Or you can just download the one click root and update guide by ??? I forgot but its on xda and use it I use it everyday and I love it&#8230;..</p>
<p>Actually, 44 sub steps.</p>
<p>Settings &#8594; About phone &#8594; System Update &#8594; Download &lt;-click!</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>One more time with feeling&#8230;</p>
<p>CANADIAN GALAXY NEXUS AREN&#8217;T GETTING THE UPDATE OVER THE AIR.</p>
<p>So no &#8211; that won&#8217;t work. Stop suggesting it.</p>
<p>This is because Samsung and the carriers are choosing not to provide the update.  If you have a Galaxy Nexus with a crummy Samsung/Canadian carrier build, CHANGE IT!  Its not hard to do and when you do you will start getting the updates immediately.</p>
<p>I am apologizing in advance, this is a tad unrelated rant. Here it goes&#8230;</p>
<p>You know what I don&#8217;t get. Why do people say &#8220;click&#8221; for a touchscreen. &#8220;tap&#8221; makes a lot more sense. Again, sorry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because what you&#8217;re seeing on the display is a simulated button. You click or press buttons, you do not tap them.</p>
<p>Nobody clicks real buttons. Click refers to the mouse.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right. I&#8217;m tired.</p>
<p>You just admitted you were wrong on the internet.. and apologised. The mayans..</p>
<p>Sorry to be a smart-ass, but you do &#8220;click&#8221; a mouse button.</p>
<p>it is indeed an abuse of language, you tap the screen of your smartphone.</p>

<p>Please tell me this was a reference to the pic of that guy&#8217;s firm abdominals.</p>
<p>Poor guys. Not even few months have passed and their phone already lost support. (won&#8217;t be getting WP8) tsch-tsch-tsch.</p>
<p>But will be getting WP 7.8 and vast number of new apps well into the future will run just fine. I guess getting an update and most new apps is now no support to some.</p>
<p>Im nervous for you guys after what MS did to the whole WinMo dev community</p>
<p>Everyone should be nervous, how long did it take sprint nexus users to get ICS?, how about the rest of the phones, or even though most iPhones, iOS devices, will have the current update number, will they have the same features? You never know now&#8230;</p>
<p>Over 90% of android users haven&#8217;t and never will get ICS and a new major update is rolling out that will probably have even less updates and you guys have the nerve to make fun of windows phones??!!!!</p>
<p>Devices like the S2, HTC Desire, the Note, the Galaxy Tabs, etc. are all scheduled for an ICS update in the US. Europe and Asia generally already have ICS. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s way more than 10% of Android users. In fact, I remember that the S2 alone was 18% of Android users.</p>

<p>Sorry, here&#8217;s from the official source: <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a><br />
According to Google, ICS is on roughly 7.1%</p>
<p>No you won&#8217;t all you are getting is the UI refresh!! Whipdy doo</p>
<p>Weird thing is the people who don&#8217;t have WP7 are complaining more about this than the people that do&#8230;</p>
<p>The people around me with WP7 don&#8217;t give a damn&#8230; they know their phones won&#8217;t get NFC, Better Screens and Dual Core CPU even if they got the full update.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just ultra excited to see what Nokia will do with all the badassery in WP8 !</p>
<p>People I talk to do give a damn because it still won&#8217;t let them get the newer apps etc all they are getting is the UI refresh per microsoft. The things you suggest are all hardware related that has nothing to do with w8&#8230;Obviously you wont get a new screen what kind of answer is that.</p>
<p>You should be excited to still see Nokia in business in 2 years.</p>
<blockquote>Weird thing is the people who don’t have WP7 are complaining more about this than the people that do…</blockquote>
<p>The people who are complaining are the same people that always does: Android-fanboys. These pathetic creatures usually are usually found in their mother&#8217;s basement and they feed on hatred against Apple and Microsoft.</p>
<p>and everybody stuck on gingerbread</p>
<p>Buy a google phone</p>
<p>Why? Jelly Bean is same shit as Ice cream sandwich. Looks like a minor upgrade.</p>
<p>ICS improvement over previous version is mere version number, that&#8217;s why carriers &amp; makers don&#8217;t feel necessary to upgrade their devices.</p>
<p>Haha&#8230;</p>
<p>What do you want a WP8 upgrade so apps are no longer compatible? Or how about an iOS update which is really just piecemeal of new features that should be standard to entice an upgrade?</p>
<p>Newsflash until a non profit becomes a tech giant any company will have glaring flaws. And when another company comes in to save the day by offering a fix it&#8217;s because they are greedy and need your money to fund vacations and exotic cars not rainbows and unicorns..</p>
<p>You really can&#8217;t point to iOS when you&#8217;re discussing the issue of product support. If there&#8217;s one thing Apple does right, it&#8217;s bringing their latest OS to the most devices it  can. Even if it means certain things must be turned off.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re kidding.. an iphone 4 can handle turn by turn nav flawlessly.. Don&#8217;t drink the koolaid.. Every Android phone in the fragmented spectrum has voice control and nav.. But since Apple says the hardware doesn&#8217;t allow it it&#8217;s ok.. When there really is a hardware limit on putting ICS on mid range devices.. Yet mysteriously these mid range devices run iOS 6 features easily..</p>
<p>iOS devices get all the updated and new APIs. That&#8217;s one of the reasons that ecosystem is so dominating.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the difference: &#8220;Even if it means certain things must be turned off&#8221;&#8230;There is the fundamental difference between Apple and Google. Apple locks down and decides what features you shd be having..Google gives you the freedom to choose what you want to have it&#8230;different schools of thought..Not that one is greater than another..and thats a win for the customer&#8230;those who want to be spoon fed, will choose apple and those who feel like a grownup and want to things by themselves will choose andriod. Simple !!!</p>
<p>Yea but, but..the jelly beans..new dessert.. Jelly beans on my ice creams. Must. Upgrade. Seriously.</p>
<p>STFU, did you read the article? There is a change in the search bar!!! I can&#8217;t wait to get on my HOX /s</p>
<p>ICS was a major update, you must never have actually used ICS.</p>
<p>Android the fastest, most reliable errors in mobile.</p>
<p><img src="http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/4795/forceclose.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yeah, nothing ever force closes on my iPad.</p>
<p>Oh. Wait. No.</p>
<p>Besides, judging from that launcher, it&#8217;s probably not ICS in your picture, which is easily the most stable version of the OS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d agree with the first statment.</p>
<p>Nothing ever force closes on my GNEX (GSM 4.0.4 awaiting JB).  Rock solid.  It just is.</p>
<p>Things always force close on my iPad. Except the iPad doesn&#8217;t prompt you that something force closed. It just sends you to the homescreen wondering what happened.</p>
<p>It must be the old iPad. Try the NEW iPad</p>
<p>I believe that this falls into the Apple way of thinking that started on desktop machines. They seem to have this &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to know that, just do what we say&#8221; thing going on.</p>
<p>Oh look, the comments descended into an iOS vs Android argument&#8230; what a fucking surprise.</p>
<p>It would be a surprise if you have been living under a rock.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re merely comparing two OSs way of handling errors. They both have their own advantages/disadvantages.</p>
<p>But this story has nothing to to do with iOS.</p>
<p>On an iPad right now and apps do crash on it. Only difference is that iOS doesn&#8217;t tell you it crashes so imbeciles like you believe it is perfect.</p>
<p>So true. iOS just dumps you back to your homescreen leaving you think you must have hit the home button by accident.</p>
<p>It is not a bad idea though. I hate to see the the little force close window&#8230; If the app would just crash and start from home it would be fine. Maybe android can copy that on jelly bean. It&#8217;s like on windows you get the stuck windows and you never know if it will work again or the little rainbow on the Mac, it&#8217;s annoying.</p>
<p>They make it think that its your fault genius. I read somewere, might of been here, that iOS apps crash more but since there isnt a prompt you don&#8217;t realize it. Google should adopt something like that into Android i never report it but i guess if you wanted the pop-up there could be some sort of setting to turn it on.</p>
<p>how can you not realize an app crashed, if you just watched it crash ? I doubt any of that information would have been posted here.</p>
<p>PREACH!!!!</p>
<p>No apps  has crashed on my iPad (Though using it since last couple of months only) but yeah apps do crash on iPhone, even on my 4S.</p>
<p>Yea the reliable errors probably have something to do with why there are less.. Any good young man reports his errors to the dev and saves a kitten from being incinerated.</p>
<p>Reporting errors is like voting in the presidential election.. relatively meaningless.</p>
<p>I have had issues solved by emailing the dev&#8217;s with logcat&#8217;s.  People want to support their products and if you give them the information and care a little they will make sure you are satisfied.</p>
<p>Maybe you should use Apps made by devs who give a shit..</p>
<p>1-Download ROM Manager<br />
2-Repair permissions<br />
3-Reboot<br />
4-Voila!</p>
<p>iOS crashes too. The difference is that they do not tell you so and just ike others have pointed, bump you back to the home screen. The crashes of course also happen more often on older iOS devices like my iPad running the latest iOS5.1.1. On newer and better devices, it occurs less. And if you use a better Android device running ICS, such as the ones from Galaxy Nexus onward, you will find &#8216;force closing&#8217; a rare treasure to find. I hope you will be more objective rather than rely on uninformed sarcasm. ;-)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a really old version of Android on a skinned device.</p>
<p>Oh look, an Android user is making fun of fragmentation on a competitor&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>dont understand why the F**K, non-andriod users come and comment on a purely android article&#8230;f***ing trolls&#8230;</p>
<p>I suspect that&#8217;s rather how Android users will feel when 3 months passes, no update, 6 month passes, no update, 1 year passes, you phone manufacturer tells you they wont update you&#8217;re phone&#8230; Oh I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m a WP user, at least future updates aren&#8217;t in the hands of the manufacturer. WP8 will be fresh start with it&#8217;s new, future proof, RT core (and 18 months of guaranteed updates).</p>
<p>*your phone manufacturer<br />
*update your phone</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<blockquote>Oh I’m so glad I’m a WP user, at least future updates aren’t in the hands of the manufacturer.</blockquote>
<p>8107</p>
<p>I guess you didn&#8217;t hear the news about WP8&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a third option, I think. Something about being a lot of effort for people who are not as heavily invested in their smartphone, or maybe people that literally don&#8217;t get it (because, maybe, there are people who are decently intelligent that still are not knowledgeable about rooting and flashing their ROM, as crazy as that might sound). I think probably we could come up with a few more reasons, if we tried really hard.</p>
<p>I thought higher numbers was a feature..</p>
<p><strong>Scoof</strong> I should never have to do this for myself. ever.</p>
<p>Then have your manservant do it.</p>
<p>I know right? Thinking is like that too. Apple products FTW!</p>
<p>Get over yourself, the Galaxy Nexus is a developer phone. It&#8217;s MEANT to be rooted and unlocked. Why do you think the LTE version is unlockable on Verizon if Google didn&#8217;t intend for the phone to be used that way? There&#8217;s been only a handful of high-end phones that have been able to be unlocked on VZW since the Droid X started the eFuse precedent.</p>
<p>Apple better be on top of the updates with a closed-source platform and a phone so locked-down. Look up the word open source and you&#8217;ll see why not receiving an update immediately isn&#8217;t a big deal for the Gnex. The people that do care will root and do it themselves, the people that don&#8217;t care&#8230;don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not ONLY for Devs, I&#8217;m not a Dev but I buy only nexus devices because they get cool updates that don&#8217;t need ROMs (but on an unlocked device ROMs are easy).</p>
<p>Point is, they are usually great devices with long term updates and people like that.</p>
<p>A &#8220;developer phone&#8221; sold in stores, advertised on buses and carrier locked&#8230;. weird.</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus sold directly by Google on the play store&#8230;not the ones sold by the carriers..therein lies the difference&#8230;</p>
<p>Still advertised very publicly on the Play store. I&#8217;ve recommended it to several non-developers. It&#8217;s a $400, contract free, GSM world phone, which makes it an awesome deal for anybody.</p>
<p>Also, the lack of updates only exists on the carrier-sold Nexii; The unlocked versions have always gotten updates immediately.</p>
<p>I get where you&#8217;re coming from but the GNex is a consumer device, first and foremost. I shouldn&#8217;t have to unlock or root my phone (or even know what those terms mean) to get ANY updates..especially updates that can affect basic and necessary functions like signal and dropped data/calls or battery life  etc. On a phone that is supposedly delivering the &#8216;Google Experience&#8217; and cutting edge software and updates! This is why most people buy a Nexus device (or at least why I will ONLY buy Nexus devices when it comes to Android) but so far its been a huge dissappointment on this front.</p>
<p>This is totally unacceptable. I can&#8217;t believe people are actually blaming the user for not being smart enough to root, unlock and manually update their phone haha..crazy. I love ICS and my GNex, btw. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m passionate and critical of Google when they drop the ball.</p>
<p>By and large, Google hasn&#8217;t dropped the ball, it&#8217;s the carriers selling the phones and locking the updates to them, rather than Google. The unlocked GNexs sold through the Play Store (yakju) have received immediate updates.</p>
<p>Wtf?? Just for devs? It is in the store, its advertised &#8230; It &#8217;s for everyone. Not just devs.</p>
<p>Someone must have lied to him at the store. Way to burst his bubble, man!</p>
<p>That yourself part 90% of people will not do because they do not wish to void warranties or are not tech literate enough to want to attempt to flash a ROM. This phone is Googles direct baby and alot of people still do not have the requisite updates.</p>
<p>They do if they got it from Google.</p>
<p>Well that should be true, guess you guys in the States are lucky because the direct units over in many other countries do not get the updates in a timely manner at all.</p>
<p>Still?  Have it on my SGS2&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..so do I.</p>
<p>wish i had it on my sgs2</p>
<p>CM9. Yeaaaaah buddy.</p>
<p>you can&#8217;t get OTA when you&#8217;re rooted</p>
<p>but you can just download the OTA zip and flash it manually</p>
<p>but if you&#8217;re not rooted, this is how you can force the update:<br />
go to settings &#8212;&gt; apps &#8212;&gt; allapps &#8212;&gt; google services<br />
and delete the cache and data<br />
reboot &#8212;&gt; BOOM</p>
<p>The OTA update for my phone has been pulled so even doing that will not give an update</p>
<p>Does that <em>really</em> work?</p>
<p>no it doesnt <em>really</em>. I have up on that method with my GNEX, took me  4 weeks AFTER the update came to Canada and got pushed out for me to get it. This was still many months after the update came out for the GNEX in the states.  Kind of a stupid process.  Could not do a manual update either, which I was able to do with a Nexus S</p>
<p>Yes, it works.</p>
<p>That worked for me.</p>
<p>(Once you update remember to log in to Google Play from the phone in order for the device to re-appear on your list of devices in Google&#8217;s database)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received OTA updates while rooted. You just have to be on a stock ROM.</p>
<p>Stock recovery is also very important, you might get the OTA but it won&#8217;t install if  you don&#8217;t have the stock recovery. But is easy as hell to flash back to stock recovery <strong>cough</strong> Galaxy Nexus ToolKit <strong>cough</strong>.</p>
<p>Aaaaaand, if you&#8217;re knowy enough to root it, you&#8217;re probably knowy enough to be able to flash in a new recovery.</p>
<p>Again the round robin of flash flash flash flash. People just want the damn updates not about of look here look there flash this root that.</p>
<p>Who cares man, just big updates are important. If you don&#8217;t have 4.0 yet than you can complain.</p>
<p>Stop this nonsense. People are trolling WP7 fanboys for having logic that stupid.</p>
<p>No one is trolling WP7 fans for having logic. If they had logic, they&#8217;d have bought an Android phone.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>How insightful your comment is. Adds so much to the discussion.</p>
<p>+1 to that. Bravo.</p>
<p>You must have never tried a wp. It&#8217;s actually awesome, and the apps look great, but still needs time to develop properly. <br />
I have used 5 android phones so far, now using a HOX, but wp has something going with their own platform.</p>
<p>I have, and while I will admit that the UI is visually stunning and modern looking, it&#8217;s simply not all that usable. Icons are an excellent example. The two things people look for when they identify an icon are color and shape. All the icons in WP are the same color, so that removes a bit of instant recognizability. iOS has the exact opposite problem.</p>
<p>In addition to that, I&#8217;ve found that I&#8217;m not as fast on a WP as I am on my Nexus. The UI is nice, but it&#8217;s not laid out as logically, and that kills my personal productivity.</p>
<p>So.. 93% of Android users</p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t happen to already have 4.0.5 on it already would you? My Nexus S has had ICS 4.0.x since december</p>
<p>Then you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>Check whether you have which <em>yakju</em> version of GN. Mine was under Samsung for OTA updates. Flashed it back to <em>yakju</em> which comes under Google. Now waiting for JB OTA. ;-)</p>
<p>Same here. My Nexus is controlled by Samsung in sweden. What a joke.</p>
<p>There is a very easy way to fix that, I hope you know this?? (Flash to yakju version)</p>
<p>Yes, there is a quick solution and it&#8217;s quite easy to follow although it can be daunting or harrowing if you are unsure and doing it alone. without experience. But there is always the first time. ;-)</p>
<p>The update was pushed about a month ago. There is something up with your phone. Did you unlock the bootloader?</p>
<p>Stop being a pussy. Root, and flash it yourself. Zero  risk, if you follow directions. 0.1% risk if you dont follow directions.</p>
<p>- Canadian Galaxy Nexus user.</p>
<p>Blame your carrier.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a stock Google phone, why are they letting the carriers have control?</p>
<p>How hard is it to get updates straight from Google? Apple manage it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they don&#8217;t have a choice. Apple can pull it off because modifying the software is illegal. Android is open source, so carriers are legally entitled to go in and change whatever they want at any level before distributing a phone.</p>
<p>yet&#8230; true</p>
<p>haha u made me crack up really loudly at work</p>
<p>Any chance that the Xyboard will run Jellybean? I don&#8217;t have a Xyboard nor do I own an android device.  I just like to use Xyboard and Jellybean in the same sentence. Perhaps they should call it the Jellyboard Xybean?</p>
<p>Xyboard? Seriously? A Xyboard? I forgot that name actually made it on to the final product.. &#8220;Will my Xyboard get Jelly Bean?&#8221; should not even be allowed to be a sentence. That ish is just  hella ridonkulous.</p>
<p>Did you even read my post you dope? Read it before you comment. It is clearly tongue in cheek dumdum.</p>
<p>maybe so, but no denying his accuracy.</p>
<p>4.1 is actually the % of phones it will ever be on.</p>
<p>&#8230;I love my Galaxy Nexus but these jokes are still kinda hilarious.</p>
<p>+1 sir.</p>
<p>I have a One X, and yes, yes they are.</p>
<p>You are [will be, anyway] the 95.9%!</p>
<p>Occupy Mountain View! We are the 95.9% !!!</p>
<p>Well&#8230;.. Then we&#8217;ll be waiting for Android 110, you know when 100% of Android devices get Android 110 and 10% of Apple&#8217;s devices will too.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but cringe at your logic, but I love the message!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that Google announces that they&#8217;ve discovered a way to bypass carrier restrictions and make future updates more modular.</p>
<p>Lol .. dont you just said people dont give a fuck about upgrade?</p>
<p>Lolwut? Taking comments out of context for 500, Alex?</p>
<p>I was saying that if you didn&#8217;t update your Galaxy Nexus to 4.0.2, you most likely don&#8217;t care enough to at all, or love to complain online.</p>
<p>ICS improvement over previous version is mere version number, that’s why carriers &amp; makers don’t feel necessary to upgrade their devices.</p>
<p>With other releases, I might be inclined to agree, but GB &#8594; ICS is definitely bigger than that.</p>
<p>Please make this be the truth.</p>
<p>Good one, made me lol :)</p>
<p>Damn. It&#8217;s like 90-something degrees outside today man, Google is gonna have a serious heatstroke after that one.</p>
<p>as long as it doesnt get 5% of the features.</p>

<p>Let me know when you get the flaming lemons down.</p>
<p>wut?</p>
<p>The post is a lie!</p>
<p>How many phone books do you think Robert Downey Jr. was sitting on in that shot?</p>
<p>LOL. But did you know that Galaxy S2 holds 20% of the Android marketshare? So, if only Samsung updated only ONE of their many models, Android 4.0 share would immediately jump to 20%.</p>
<p>Google needs to kick manufacturers in the butt and push them to either provide quick upgrades or just run stock Android for good.</p>
<p>There is an Android 4.0 update for the S2. The issue is whether or not people care enough to download it.</p>
<p>also up to the carriers to push out the update too</p>
<p>Here in the UK we&#8217;re lucky enough to have carriers that don&#8217;t try and get involved with all that stuff. Their influence over manufacturers is no where near as bad as it is in the US. ;)</p>
<p>Its generally like that everywhere BUT the US.</p>
<p>Canada&#8217;s telco industry makes the US&#8217;s look like paradise by comparison. It&#8217;s the one thing that makes me feel better about our shitty healthcare.</p>
<p>Something which I think many people don&#8217;t bother about due to the phone not actually notifying of an update or the lack of hype like a new version of ICS</p>
<blockquote>There is an Android 4.0 update for the S2.</blockquote>
<p>please link me to the legit update, that won&#8217;t hurt the warranty on my work phone that i can&#8217;t root, since there just &#8220;is one&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230; lol.</p>
<p>you can install any OS you want on it. rooting isn&#8217;t anything special, its just logging in as admin aka superuser.&#8217;</p>
<p>The &#8220;legitimate&#8221; way to get ics is with Keis software via sammy at <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/kies/" target="_blank">http://www.samsung.com/us/kies/</a> install, plug in phone, and you should get a prompt with step by step instructions to upgrade.</p>
<p>Full guide here <a href="http://www.knowyourmobile.com/samsung/galaxysII/galaxysiiuserguides/1281300/how_to_update_your_samsung_galaxy_s2_to_android_ice_cream_sandwich_via_kies.html" target="_blank">http://www.knowyourmobile.com/samsung/galaxysII/galaxysiiuserguides/1281300/how_to_update_your_samsung_galaxy_s2_to_android_ice_cream_sandwich_via_kies.html</a></p>
<p>Or you could do it yourself, adn get the AOSP version from xda if you don&#8217;t like touchwiz. It does not void your warranty, as you can simply refer back to sammy default (especially easy if you have clockwork mod/nandroid and do a backup).</p>
<p>Just to be clear, that last paragraph of mine is not &#8220;hacking&#8221; any more than upgrading Windows to the newest version on your pc.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that still trigger the flash counter?</p>
<p>The flash counter?  Are we making up things now?  The phone has no memory of being flashed or not, and Samsung still warranties phones that have had rom&#8217;s flashed on them.  <br />
So flashing back to stock before sending the phone in for repair is not a big deal at all, neither is flashing rom&#8217;s custom or otherwise.</p>
<p>Just to clear things up, am I making that flash counter feature up?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>No, official ROMs don&#8217;t add to the flash counter, it&#8217;s just the custom ones that do.</p>
<p>Or you could just find it yourself. This is what I&#8217;m talking about when I say that the issue is people just not putting in the effort to upgrade.</p>
<p>The fact that I had to use Kies to get this, rather than a simple OTA carrier push made it much more difficult.</p>
<p>And it screwed up my phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t blame people for not updating their phones.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s model, and maybe Microsoft&#8217;s new WP8 model, seems to be the right way to update phones.</p>
<p>Hopefully Google is taking notes. OEMs and carriers DON&#8217;T CARE.</p>
<p>GSII does NOT hold 20% of Android Marketshare. Not even close. I&#8217;m not sure where you got that number, but it&#8217;s false</p>
<p>Until recently, I believe the HTC EVO 4G (WiMAX) was the best selling Android phone.  I think the GS II overtook it sometime last year.</p>
<p>A phone which is on ONE single network in US is the largest selling Android&#8230;What sort of pathetic logic is that? Please show me a link where it says EVO 4G sold more than 25 million units.</p>
<p>It may have been US-only, but here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npdgroup.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111114a#" target="_blank">http://www.npdgroup.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111114a#</a>.T-S4MY7tLVs</p>
<p>Similar reports for every quarter from release of HTC EVO 4G through late 2011 when Samsung Galaxy SII overtook it.  So it was the best selling Android smartphone in the US since mid 2010 through late 2011.  Pretty impressive considering that Sprint is the third-largest carrier in the USA.  A large percentage of their smartphone sales were the HTC EVO 4G.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see some numbers backing the &#8220;20% of Android Marketshare&#8221; quoted above.  I believe that is a total overstatement.</p>
<p>Yeah, according to my developer console the GS2 is 10pc of my app installs.</p>
<p>According to mine it is 27.22% Bound to vary by country. Most of my users are in the UK.</p>
<p>Yeah, the GS2 is very popular here.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t they do some PR bull about a upgrade alliance or some phony baloney?</p>
<p>Yep, at the same time they announced Android@home.</p>
<p>Neither went anywhere&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the next version of android, not jelly bean, but the one after, so maybe then I will get jelly bean. :)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really care as long as my G Nex gets it.<br />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4yk1sH7Mr1r91g01.gif" /></p>
<p>Could not agree more&#8230;. This is the reason I picked Nexus over S3. It has virtually the same screen and it will not be outdated in a matter of weeks. And it is cheaper too.</p>
<p>Until all your apps are buggy and devs don&#8217;t care about fixing them yet because only 1% of users are on 4.1.</p>
<p>I had an N1 before my Gnex and never really had this issue.  Are you speaking from experience or just bashing?</p>
<p>He really hasn&#8217;t got a clue. ICS problems were fixed by devs almost immediately. Because devs like cool new tech and tend to have dev phones :)</p>
<p>Well all the devs that matter</p>
<p>No, there are a lot of cool apps but they are never updated.. Just look at ea apps. I want to play them but they don&#8217;t even work on my device (HOX)</p>
<p>EA is pretty terrible as a mobile developer, almost as bad as they are at developing for PC.  Battlefield 3 was a bug storm for me and most of my friends.  If it wasn&#8217;t such an awesome game I never would have put up $60 for it, and I won&#8217;t buy their mobile games after I got burned with my old galaxy tab.</p>
<p>I know all of the reddit apps I used when I had my gnex had various bugs for a while and I didn&#8217;t get the phone until the end of January.</p>
<p>The point of Android is that its forwards compatible so almost any app will work fine on higher versions of Android than its intended.</p>
<p>I thought that is called &#8220;backward&#8221; compatible.</p>
<p>Apps are forward compatible, the OS is backwards compatible. As long as you don&#8217;t switch up which is which, you&#8217;re golden like the gate bridge.</p>
<p>So fucking true</p>
<p>Why is it just recently that iOS, Android or WIndows Phone, updates are always a controversy</p>
<p>Each party ruins the other ones.  Trolls come in on WP8 announcements, and just rage the shit out of them.</p>
<p>Then they come in on iOS6 announcements, and rage the shit out of them, now it&#8217;s android&#8217;s turn.</p>
<p>It sucks, and is useless, but that&#8217;s why.  Seriously, android isn&#8217;t going anywhere, and neither are the other two.  And thankfully they&#8217;re all going forward.</p>
<p>Hey now, you&#8217;re not allowed to make sense here! This is the internet! Gpusw l</p>
<p>Disregard that last bit&#8230;.</p>
<p>This is the internet, we never disregard anything!!!!</p>
<p>What an asshole&#8230; Who are you trolling with that comment?..</p>
<p>because tech nerds need to cyber-fight and someone will undoubtedly begin to bash one OS.</p>
<p>Its just like the car forums.</p>
<p>&#8220;tech nerds need to cyber fight&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine how awesome that would have sounded in 1986. I would be imagining two cyber-punk types trying to wirelessly hack into each others neural implants.</p>
<p>Or hack into their friends neural implants to have a unwilling double agent&#8230;</p>
<p>I sense a movie deal&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s 5 % more than WP7.8 devices getting WP8.</p>
<p>True, however the WP7.5 devies will be getting WP7.8&#8230;  That&#8217;s one more update than many Android phones get.  If Nokia were Samsung, we would have been told that there would be no more updates at all.</p>
<p>This pissing match must look hilarious to an iOS user.</p>
<p>LOL agree.</p>
<p>Update numbers are just for showing how much cooler you are then your other Apple user. Luckly you all get the latest number update even if your phone can&#8217;t support the features. Lucky Apple owners. iOS is sooOOoooOOOoo much better. right? RIGHT?</p>
<p> /s</p>
<p>At least they aren&#8217;t left in the dust after a year <strong>stares at HTC EVO 4G</strong></p>
<p>Now what features are you missing?</p>
<p>Lol, Evo 4g, by now, it must be rooted to be usable.</p>
<p>And yet my question isn&#8217;t answered.</p>
<p>You are aware that version updates of any OS don&#8217;t just consist of user features but also APIs.</p>
<p>Even with the 3GS getting iOS6 lite it still means devs can totally confidently target iOS6.</p>
<p>Sadly the average poster here doesn&#8217;t seem to understand the importance of APIs. WP7 users are about to discover this importance in a big way once WP8 is out.</p>
<p>Well &#8230; at least Microsoft has good reason not to upgrade WP7.5.  Google on the other hand just does not care.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t understand how it works.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to understand, we just want to defend these companies&#8217; platforms as if we were paid by them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to&#8221; is not a &#8220;good reason&#8221;</p>
<p>Seriously doubt a single core 1.4 GHZ processor could handle the Windows Core. Face it, Windows Phone was a transition OS. I think that is a little different then Apple not including some of its features (can&#8217;t recall specifics).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it can, ever since WP8 will actually target low-end devices as well. Now if it doesn&#8217;t target low-end, WP8 is an actual death sentence for WP.</p>
<p>iOS6 does not offer any of its unqiue &#8220;features&#8221; for the still capable iPhone 4. Forced amputated by Apple for monies! So eat that. Sad iPhone 4 user :(</p>
<p>Samsung have always been excellent at updating their phones (US carriers on the other hand&#8230;)</p>
<p>GS1 &#8211; two major updates, to Froyo and then Gingerbread (no ICS due to lack of RAM)<br />
GS2 &#8211; one major update so far, no reason not to expect one to Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>You really sound like an ass hat.</p>
<p>iPhone 4S &#8211; 0 major updates</p>
<p>haha, true.</p>
<p>I was wondering why they changed that. I liked the X.1, X.2, etc, updates. I would rather have that then major yearly updates. Whatever, maybe after 5ish years, they have something like writers block. Typing block???</p>
<p>iPhone 4 &#8211; 0 major updates</p>
<p>( I know all I got was iOS 5 which gave me half of the notification options my first Android phone had)</p>
<p>Yeah, iOS 5 and 6 really don&#8217;t offer anything innovative over 4.</p>
<p>Yeah iCloud was no big deal at all. LOLWUT</p>
<p>GS1  (no ICS due to lack of RAM) ???<br />
The Nexus S with the same 512 MB of RAM does have ICS. That was just a lame excuse from Samsung, just like when parents told their kids the dog &#8220;run away&#8221; when it actually died.</p>
<p>ICS plus the touchwiz interface was too big.  Soooo glad I stick to Nexus devices.</p>
<p>This. And for the 99% of GS1 that don&#8217;t read tech blogs a TW free ICS would have been a terrible customer shock.</p>
<p>GS1 isn&#8217;t a nexus device. It isn&#8217;t obligated to have updates.</p>
<p>So I guess getting update 8 months after OS release is considered excellent by your standard.</p>
<p>more of an Android standard not his standard</p>
<p>carrier standard not an Android user standard.</p>
<p>touché</p>
<p>It is the fucking standard, specially of you have an android device. Same carriers have the iPhone.. How long does it take?. Same carriers have wp devices, how long does it take?.. Now, I don&#8217;t know about BBs, but hopefully Samsung is gaining some weight to push updates if they decide to do it, it would be hard thoug with all the changes in software and hardware they made to ICS and android standards,</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t know what &#8220;closed-source vs. open-source&#8221; means, do you?</p>
<p>I still wish the carriers would push the value pack update to me. Its not ics but it does get some features of it. At least samsung doesnt pretend it is ics.<br />
Ugh. Btw i wish suggestions would actually show up on my swift key trial.</p>
<p>SGS has an issue with ICS due to the partition layout, not RAM.</p>
<p>Stock ICS runs smooth as butter on my GS1 (Devil Kernel).</p>
<p>Yes, the official firmware only went up to GB, but fact is, if you are really bothered to get the next version of Android on it, its about an hour away.</p>
<p>For all those stuck on GB, they are obviously so happy with what they have that they can&#8217;t afford an hour to experience the awesomeness of Stock ICS (with plenty of user space memory available).</p>
<p>Android users can get a copy of the new 4.1 wallpaper to apply to their own phones.  We&#8217;ll call this the Android 4.0.9 update.  That should be &#8220;more than enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>I see what you did there ;-)</p>
<p>And the new search widget. We gave you the new widget.</p>
<p>Android users can get that style of update by installing a skin or launcher from the market.</p>
<p>Hey, android users can play dumb and not complain!</p>
<p>yeah, because that&#8217;s the same thing&#8230; SMH<br />
WP8 is a shift in the kernel and hardware so it makes sense to update older devices to 7.8 and bring the features they can to older hardware while keeping the user experience smooth.<br />
correct me if i&#8217;m wrong but JB, ICS and GB all use the same kernel right? the thing holding them back is carriers and OEM&#8217;s adding crap to their platform and not letting users have the vanilla experience that would allow android to run smoothly on said hardware.</p>
<p>They all use the linux kernel, but they&#8217;re each a different version. froyo, GB and HC were all in the 2.6.something and ICS is 3.0</p>
<p>The ICS kernel was roughly 70% new code, so it was a huge update.  I doubt whether there will be another massive kernel update in the near future.  Its still the US carriers slowing down updates to make sure they are &#8220;acceptable&#8221; to them.</p>
<p>I like intelligent comments. Yours was an intelligent comment.</p>
<p>FYI: I believe:</p>
<p>2.2 used 2.6.32<br />
2.3 used 2.6.35<br />
3.x used 2.6.36<br />
4.0 uses 3.0.8 (at least on my nexus).</p>
<p>I agree with Orangestrat, it&#8217;s about the Major shift from a Mobile kernel to part of the Windows NT(?) kernel, which is now being called the Windows Core (it would have been better for Apple to call it the Mac OS X Core in their Apple computers, but, their is no way Apple would put that in iOS. To un-ethical&#8230;</p>
<p>The Apple Core [rolls eyes =) ]</p>
<p>Oh, buuuurn.</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>&#8220;by 2014 maybe 5% will have it&#8221;. Still much better than iPhonoes. None of the iPhones will have it. They all are stuck with outdated mobile OS.</p>
<p>Oh no!  Not our iPhonoes!</p>
<p><strong>Obvious Troll</strong> is <strong>Obvious</strong></p>
<p>More like obvious joke is obvious&#8230;</p>
<p>You do realise that you posting crap over in this thread is very much a trollish behaviour, considering your name.</p>
<p>So?.. This shit goes on everywhere, wp news have android shitheads commenting, apple news the same, so it&#8217;s ok to have iOS shitheads here. It is just the way it is. Sadly.</p>
<p>This one is blatantly obvious, if you didn&#8217;t get the irony.</p>
<p>Lol &#8230; now you talk like a real 5 years old.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>But the thing is, by the end of the month, 100% of HSPA+ Galaxy Nexus&#8217; will have it.<br />
Basically, if you care that much about updates, buy that phone..</p>
<p>I would get that phone because it&#8217;s unlocked at $400. That, along with T-Mobiles insane Monthly4G plans, it&#8217;s a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>What about sprint&#8217;s galaxy nexus?</p>
<p>End of the year, hopefully?</p>
<p>What does that say for the whole idea of Android offering choice?</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be the slowest Android adoption yet! (Considering ICS just passed 7% less-than 6 months after the release of the first device).</p>
<p>I believe that Gingerbread was still slower then ICS.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the memory footprint and driver model changes.</p>
<p>If the footprint is the same or less, and if the driver model stays the same, then vendors might just leap-frog to 4.1.</p>
<p>A little optimistic, no?</p>
<p>how many brand new nokia lumia 900s are going to get windows phone 8????</p>
<p>And how many otters does it take to change a light bulb?  Wait, relevance?  Oh yes, there is none, like your comment.  What does lumia 900&#8217;s getting win7.8 have to do with androids not getting updated?     I will ask the otters, perhaps they can explain it to me.</p>
<p>Barely 5% have ICS now and it is almost 7 months out.  I think you are too generous without your estimate.  Maybe .5% would be more accurate.  By the time Jelly Bean has 5 %, KrispyKreme 5.0 will be out and most phones will still be on Gingerbread.</p>
<p>I think you are thinking too simplistically at the numbers and assuming that the current ICS adoption rate will move forward.</p>
<p>Fact is, that Android phones exist on multiple tiers. At the low-end, GB or Froyo might be the best that the hardware can aspire to (ICS really needs 512MB RAM and many phones still ship with or have shipped with 256MB or 384MB).</p>
<p>As time move on, a higher proportion on low-end phones will hit the 512MB RAM threshold as the high-end settles on 1GB and soon to be 2GB. Some low-end phones will never get ICS, or at least not an ICS that would be usable. The Android stats do not split phones up by OS version / RAM size. If they did, you would see a much higher adoption rate on &gt;= 512MB devices and approximately zero on &lt; 512MB devices.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s approach is to claim that all phones get the latest update (3GS gets 6.0), but then to disable features that the hardware cannot deal with (lots and lots of features disabled for 3GS). New software cannot magically create new hardware into your phone.</p>
<p>So, ICS adoption rate is slow due to the wealth of low spec Android phones (which is awesome by the way for it allows affordable internet connectivity in the third world).</p>
<p>Another factor in the slow ICS adoption rate is that the kernel and driver model changed between 2.3 and 4.0. This is equivalent to the leap from XP to Vista. Lots of hardware required new drivers compiling and the build process had to be completely changed for 4.0+. I am speculating here, but I don&#8217;t expect this same kind of kernel level change for 4.1, meaning rollouts for compatible hardware should be faster for 4.1 versus 4.0.</p>
<p>Putting this all together. More and more ICS capable hardware is shipping, and 4.1 will likely be a release that involves a lot less effort for carriers to bastardise (assuming they&#8217;ve already pre-bastardised ICS). As such, 4.1 should have a much faster adoption rate than 4.0.</p>
<p>Am I the only one who imagines vergers laughing like squidward after leaving comments like this?</p>
<p>This is lame.</p>
<p>Come on, it&#8217;s like me stating &#8220;Windows Phone 8 not coming to existing devices lol&#8221; on every Windows Phone article or &#8220;iOS no app-to-app communication can&#8217;t even add to system-wide share function&#8221; on iOS articles. These are simply realities of the respective ecosystems and everyone here knows about them.</p>
<p>Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>Cool beans!</p>
<p>JB : ICS :: GB : FY?</p>
<p>Hooray! I had a feeling uit&#8217;d be 4.1. I mean, 5.0 right after 4.0.x doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Even with Google&#8217;s mindset.</p>
<p>Well, you didn&#8217;t try to make sense of it.  1 and 2 were builds for phones, they gave 3 to tablets, and 4 is uniting them.</p>
<p>I think you missed his point</p>
<p>To be announced at Google I/O?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have to imagine so!</p>
<p>Jelly Donut. Jell-O. Jelly</p>
<p><a href="http://gifsforum.com/images/image/you%20jelly/grand/why_so_jelly.jpg" target="_blank">http://gifsforum.com/images/image/you%20jelly/grand/why_so_jelly.jpg</a></p>
<p>So Jelly Bean will be out before I get ICS?!?!  Thats awesome.  Gonna get the unlocked Nexus when it has Jelly Bean preloaded</p>
<p>What phone do you have?</p>
<p>Galaxy Note for now.  Still on Gingerbread for the foreseeable future, then I&#8217;ll get Gingerbread + whenever the Wizified ICS update comes to AT&amp;T</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one phone that has enough of a modded version that it takes too long to get updates. It might even be worth it, at least the skin and additional stuff on the note makes sense.</p>
<p>will be removed in 5..4..3..</p>
<p>Hmm. First phone with Jelly Bean. Doe s that mean the report  about the 5 Nexus devices from different OEMs was false?</p>
<p>Why would it be? The moment Google releases the build, the OEMs have to make the phone, let alone release it. Meanwhile, we just slap the Jellybean ROM on the Galaxy Nexus and be done with it.</p>
<p>Means 4.1 will be out by Summer whereas other devices aren&#8217;t till Fall.</p>
<p>Maybe Jelly Bean isn&#8217;t the next major update, but an intermediate update and we&#8217;ll see a major one (5.0?) in the fall with the 5 Nexus phones</p>
<p>You are correct sir.</p>
<p>Google has said they are now only doing 1 release a year of Android.  So we will not see 5.0 until next year most likely.</p>
<p>Depends whether they consider 4.1 &#8220;major&#8221; as 4.0 was released last year and 5 could be this year is 4.1 isn&#8217;t &#8220;major&#8221;.  I tend to doubt that though.</p>
<blockquote>Lockheimer added: &#8220;In general, the Android release cadence is one major release a year with some maintenance releases that are substantial still.&#8221; That statement would suggest a fall 2012 time frame for the release of Android 5.0, given that Android 4.0 was released last November, he acknowledged.</blockquote>
<p>- Hiroshi Lockheimer, vice president of engineering for mobile at Google.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9224652/Google_exec_hints_of_Android_5.0_release_this_fall_" target="_blank">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/print/9224652/Google_exec_hints_of_Android_5.0_release_this_fall_</a></p>
<p>It depends if computerworld made the assumption 5.0 would be next. He acknowledged a release in November, but CW might have made the 5.0 assumption. They often do make bad, bad assumptions.</p>
<p>They never said that. In fact, Matias said that he wants them to accelerate because &#8220;computers still suck&#8221; and they need to iterate quickly.</p>
<p>He said they need to iterate quickly, not accelerate releases.  Because of the way they have to deal with OEMs, they realized that two major releases a year is impossible for their partners.</p>
<p>I think this is more like the incremental updates they have on iOS so I know they usually stop at something like #.5</p>
<p>Copy of my comment from Droid-Life:</p>
<p>It seems very very odd to me that Google would do this &#8211; especially when before the ICS announcement, it was leaked that they&#8217;d left &#8216;game-changing features until Jelly Bean&#8217;. (I&#8217;m guessing that means Majel and other &#8216;game-changing&#8217; improvements, whatever they may be). &#8216;4.1&#8217; doesn&#8217;t sound game-changing, feature wise &#8211; &#8216;5.0&#8217; does, as 4.0 did when ICS released.</p>
<p>Still, if Jelly Bean is 4.1 I&#8217;ll be very happy &#8211; but again, this only increases the chance that OEMs aren&#8217;t going to update. We&#8217;ve got, what, not even 10% of the Android world on ICS? Again, it seems odd to me.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re reading too much into the numbers. Though too be fair so does the press at times.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: launching &#8220;5.0&#8221; with 4.0 stats being as it were would be terrible PR.</p>
<p>But why couldn&#8217;t 4.1 be ICS? Same content, different name.</p>
<p>Then launch 5.0 in the autumn with the new Nexus(es).</p>
<p>There really isn&#8217;t much to read in to version numbers. Remember that 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.x were all different code names with only incremental number changes, but had pretty big changes.</p>
<p>Because everyone expects JB at I/O, if they don&#8217;t there will be massive dissapointment</p>
<p>No they don&#8217;t &#8211; they expect some kind of new version of Android, whether that be Jelly Bean or updated ICS.</p>
<p>Would you be disappointed if they announced Jelly Bean for release in the fall/autumn and released 4.1 as updated ICS?</p>
<p>Not really &#8211; if the APIs change significantly enough (Majel for instance), they&#8217;d be better off giving it a new name.</p>
<p>I also think they might not be releasing 4.1 at I/O, but it&#8217;d be good to announce it and some of the features, considering everyone just got excited about iOS6.</p>
<blockquote>Would you be disappointed if they announced Jelly Bean for release in the fall/autumn and released 4.1 as updated ICS?</blockquote>
<p>Meaning JB is not shown at I/O? Yes, totally.</p>
<p>Well, they demonstrated a bit of ICS at I/O last year. I&#8217;d be fine with it if they announced it as Jelly Bean, gave us a logo, and told us about some cool new features. Oh, and formally announced Majel as well.</p>
<p>Everyone will call it Jelly Bean &#8211; the numbers don&#8217;t really mean jack.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t read that much into it. Google has to come to the party this year. They need a siri competitor (and it needs to be better), they need to improve google maps to steal Apple&#8217;s thunder before it even starts and they need to add features I haven&#8217;t even considered yet. Its on this year, iOS 6 was a decent upgrade, WP8 is a newsworthy upgrade. This year is the year for them to shine.</p>
<p>Why is everyone so bothered about Siri-like app? I&#8217;ve never understood the fascination with voice control, you look like a tit and its not often faster.</p>
<p>It goes back to the Apple obsession, really. It&#8217;s not that a Siri-competitor is necessary, it&#8217;s that all of these guys think that the only way to do things is to do them like Apple. Occasionally, they&#8217;re right, but usually they&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>I actually wrote something like that in my business exam today was a question about Acer&#8217;s directors seeing the tablet market as risky anywhere story for another day.</p>
<p>But I do agree with you it is just blindly following Apple so they can say to Joe Public that they have what Apple has, but Majel(?) does seem like a better system especially when integrated with Google&#8217;s best product of search</p>
<blockquote>but Majel(?) does seem like a better system especially when integrated with Google’s best product of search</blockquote>
<p>Siri already does that, actually. And so does Google&#8217;s already existing voice command abilities.</p>
<p>Exactly &#8211; Voice control bizzle has been on phones for an age and no one uses it, because it&#8217;s stoopid.</p>
<p>Manufacturers seem to have replaced it with Vlingo on almost every Android phone I have used</p>
<p>It has its situations, but yeah I&#8217;m not that stoked about it but its what the press want. If they don&#8217;t release one it&#8217;ll be incredibly bad press.</p>
<p>It depends on the use case. I&#8217;ve noticed that for placing reminders and scheduling calendar events, natural language is a far better, faster way of doing things.</p>
<p>For example, saying &#8220;Wake me up at 9am&#8221; and having the system set the alarm is better than opening your alarms app/widget/whatever, creating a new alarm, scrolling the time to 9am, and setting the day.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely a good usage scenario. But I&#8217;d also like to be able to type that in and have it work as well (Google Calendar on desktop does this really well), because if you&#8217;re somewhere you can&#8217;t talk then the whole idea is useless.</p>
<p>There are some particular use cases when you need to go hands-free, or where it&#8217;s more convenient to do it. I think Windows Phone has a good chance at covering these use cases since third-party apps can tap in to the voice commands, granted the recognition is good enough. Apple might get the most media coverage, but I believe Microsoft &amp; Google may get the job done better.</p>
<p>Eclair (2.1) to Froyo (2.2)<br />
Froyo (2.2) to Gingerbread (2.3)<br />
Honeycomb for tablets (3.0)<br />
Ice Cream Sandwich for phones/tablets (4.0)<br />
ICS (4.0) to Jellybean (4.1)</p>
<p>You&#8217;re (conveniently) forgetting:</p>
<p>Eclair (2.0) to 2.1 (also Eclair)<br />
Honeycomb (3.0) to 3.1 and 3.2 (also both Honeycomb)<br />
Reportedly, Google also considered releasing 2.4 (Gingerbread) as an interim update to 2.3, but it never happened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not conveniently forgetting anything.  Google has been pretty consistent with the versioning.  Codename changes generally mean significant consumer-facing changes.  Point-releases for the same codename (like your Eclair and Honeycomb examples) are important under the hood changes resulting in a new platform version (aka API level).</p>
<p>At every point release release they&#8217;ve changed the API level. At every .0 release they&#8217;ve changed the API level.</p>
<p>Also: sorry if I sounded threatening when I said (conveniently). I didn&#8217;t mean for it to come across like that, but it&#8217;s very hard to express tone of voice in written text.</p>
<p>2.0  was really Droid/Milestone exclusive.</p>
<p>4.1 probably would mean the APIs aren&#8217;t changing much so there will be little to do for devs to update their apps.  I would expect the next major version jump to require a lot more changes for devs.</p>
<p>Frankly, 4.0 wasn&#8217;t that big of a change. The only thing I did is change the target API and not a single line of code.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the idea behind Android though. The API levels are supposed to build on each other. So you can be level 12 compliant without changing anything despite originally writing to level 8 or whatever.</p>
<p>The point is now that you have targeted a higher API you have more available to you, though apparently you decided not to use it (or at least not at that point)</p>
<p>When did Google actually mean something they said ? It doesn&#8217;t matter, they change their mind everytime, it&#8217;s actually the company policy to be able to release products more faster.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t expect big game changers!</p>
<p>however 4.1 makes more sense than 5.0 according to me since before this honeycomb thingy they always incremented by 0.1 for the big updates</p>

<p>Maybe 25:10 is actually a clue?</p>
<p>That they invented the 26 hour clock?</p>
<p>or they are teasing a date.</p>
<p>You mean like October 25? This would be a Thursday, pretty sure Google&#8217;s date for releasing any new phones is &#8220;as-soon-as-f-ing-possible&#8221;.  GNex was seriously the rockiest launch for a phone I&#8217;ve ever witnessed.</p>
<p>It would have not been a rocky launch if a certain Steve Jobs didn&#8217;t expire too close to the original launch date.</p>

<p>fu*kin &#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t have words for you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. They moved it back out of respect for him. If he hadn&#8217;t have died right when he did, it would have gone ahead as planned. There&#8217;s no need to be all offended about a simple fact.</p>
<p>keep telling yourself <a href="http://androidandme.com/2011/11/devices/the-samsung-galaxy-nexus-and-the-launch-that-could-have-been/">that</a>, mate.</p>
<p>Nobody is going to take you seriously with that username</p>
<p>O rly ?</p>
<p>Nope, I&#8217;m not taking you seriously.</p>
<p>Google did move the date of the Galaxy Nexus announcement back because of Jobs&#8217; tragic and unfortunate death.</p>
<p>LOL not again please&#8230; XD</p>
<p>Well, just one more time then&#8230;</p>
<p>Jobs&#8217; death prompted an obvious outpouring of grief from the whole tech community &#8211; Google recognised Jobs&#8217; achievements, and as a mark of respect, moved the date of their phone and new OS announcement back.</p>
<p>When I said that the GNex had the rockiest launch ever- I wasn&#8217;t referring to its announcement.. The actual launch (on Verizon) was a clusterfuck, there were so many dates for when it was supposed to be available and Verizon wasn&#8217;t saying a thing, then eventually loaded it w/ some of their own apps.</p>
<p>Quit taking everything so personally. It&#8217;s a pretty widely known fact that Google pushed back the GNex back because of Steve&#8217;s death. They even said that there were tons of Google employees who were grief-stricken over his death, so they moved it back out of respect for Steve and for those who were grieving.</p>
<p>The AOSP issues and technical problems with the CDMA version would have occurred if Jobs had expired or not. I think that&#8217;s what iOS 6 is saying.</p>
<p>this changes everything&#8230;. again</p>
<p>2+5 = 7 <br />
1+0 = 1</p>
<p>So 7/1 = July 1st</p>
<p>As wicked as that is, Google wouldn&#8217;t do a hint like that in base 10&#8230;</p>
<p>You can see more of the homescreen in the Google I/O app screenshots.  Along with the 26 hour clock.</p>
<p>You know what place operates with 26 hours?<br />

<p>DS9 also debuted Google Glass.</p>

<p>So does that make Google the Dominion?</p>
<p>&#8230;and in the meantime on a starship debuted Google Android.</p>

<p>Why are people so awesome here? :D</p>
<p>Because they have <strong>Brains</strong> here ?! :/</p>
<p>DON&#8217;T CALL THE ZOMBIES IN!</p>
<p>Yes, I never mention The Verge on any other site I visit (mostly because all the other sites I visit are just for kicks and laughing at trolls. It is really fun.)</p>
<p>ITS A HINT FOR THE STARTREK COMPUTER MAJEL!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>If this is really Jellybean, it&#8217;s disappointing that the app launcher and phone icons weren&#8217;t moved to the navigation bar on the home screen.  In other words, the &#8220;Home&#8221; and &#8220;Back&#8221; buttons don&#8217;t need to be there until you actually enter an app.</p>
<p>That Frog UI was a good example of how to do this: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3094096/frog-design-android-feel-ux-sharp" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3094096/frog-design-android-feel-ux-sharp</a></p>

<p>There&#8217;s just a new wallpaper.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a very nice wallpaper at that.</p>
<p>Better than the ICS default one:</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.androidcommunity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wallpaper_chroma.jpg" /></p>
<p>iam an iOS but i like ICS Default wallpaper better then this new crap.</p>
<p>What?! You use iOS??? &#8230;no way.</p>
<p>No. Read carefully. He <strong>is</strong> iOS.</p>
<p>i Love the default one! Organic + Retro + Futuristic, all in one!</p>
<p>Why is the search bar&#8230; greyish? I don&#8217;t like that.  I like how nearly invisible it is now. :&lt;</p>
<p>They want to draw attention to their voice commands I would imagine.</p>
<p>BOOOOO. maybe.</p>
<p>Either way it&#8217;ll probably be super easy to go back with a custom launcher, this is android.</p>
<p>Thank you! I find it ridiculous that I had to come down this far to find someone who realizes what an ugly step backwards a solid gray search bar would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Retina&#8221;</p>
<p>7% of people will have ICS before Jelly Bean is announced. That&#8217;s kinda sad. Might as well consider each Android version a &#8220;release preview&#8221; since OEMs will never be able to keep up at this rate.</p>
<p>If people really did care, everyone would buy Nexus handsets. Sadly that isn&#8217;t the case (although I wish it was).</p>
<p>If Google really did care, it would have released the Galaxy Nexus everywhere and not just in a handful of markets.</p>
<p>Just from Wikipedia:<br />
United Kingdom, Ireland,  France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Slovenia, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Canada, The United States, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bahrain &amp; Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Hnadful?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t spell handful&#8230;.. #fail</p>
<p>Compare that to the markets the iPhone 4S is sold in and you&#8217;ll see that it is in fact handful. Even Samsung&#8217;s other phone are sold in more markets. The Galaxy Nexus, for example, is not available in a major market like India.</p>
<p>Google has historically sold the Nexus devices in limited markets. Even now when they put up the Galaxy Nexus on the Play Store it&#8217;s only available in the US. It&#8217;s like they don&#8217;t want people to buy them.</p>
<p>Thats OEM blocking. Google has always said that the GNex or any other nexus are &#8220;developer phones&#8221;, I&#8217;m sure because of OEM pressure.</p>
<p>I am waiting for them to snap and do a MS surface on it using Moto :P, that&#8217;ll be awesome.</p>
<p>More like carriers don&#8217;t people to buy them.</p>
<p>+ carriers don&#8217;t want people to buy them&#8230;.</p>
<p>/edit button?</p>
<p>But they can still sell the handsets directly in other markets without having to go through the carriers. They are not even doing that.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t know any better. The Nexus phones never get any significant marketing push by neither the manufacturers, or the carriers.</p>
<p>Samsung would rather push the S2/S3 because it&#8217;s a &#8220;Samsung experience&#8221;, and the carriers don&#8217;t want to end up as dumb pipes, so they order customized, branded phones with their bloat preloaded.</p>
<p>But what if someone wants a phone with better hardware?  I mean, should I not recommend the GSIII to anyone because it&#8217;s skinned?  There are a lot of great non-Nexus phones out there.</p>
<p>I thought I had read that GSII&#8217;s would be getting the ICS update Q2 of &#8216;12.  If that&#8217;s the truth, they&#8217;re waiting until the end of the quarter because I haven&#8217;t seen the announcement, nor have I gotten the new OS.</p>
<p>Which Galaxy S II do you have? I got it around April (can&#8217;t exactly remember when) with the first of the international i9200 updates.<br />
<a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s2-ice-cream-sandwich-update-comes-to-unlocked-handsets-1076369" target="_blank">http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s2-ice-cream-sandwich-update-comes-to-unlocked-handsets-1076369</a></p>
<p>Sprint, in the US.  Hopefully it comes soon, I liked what I was seeing while playing with a friend&#8217;s GNex.</p>
<p>International version has it I think it is mostly US carrier variants that don&#8217;t</p>
<p>By the release schedule, there is no international version. There is a single, global if you must call it something, device and the crap that US gets.</p>
<p>Essentially the same thing though and global could be confused with its radio capabilities</p>
<p>I Bought an LTE Galaxy Nexus.  It took VZW 6 Months to push out an update to 4.0.4 from 4.0.2.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if it is a nexus. It is the carriers that are stalling here.  <br />
They say it was to guarantee and improve performance of the radio. My radio actually freezes and loses signal more frequently.  I have to reboot it every so often now as well. due to their fixing of it. <br />
MS got it right with the early adopter option, the spoke about with WP8.</p>
<p>I can only speak from the experience of a GSM Nexus owner. Luckily for me, the GSM Nexus One, Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus was far better for updates than any of the CDMA Nexus handsets.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree at all with what Google have let Verizon do to the Gnex  in the U.S. Appalling.</p>
<p>Thank you for grokking my pain.  It is shameful. It also is a shame that the carriers have been allowed so much power after seeing the abuses of the ATT/Bell monopoly.</p>
<p>If google advertises the nexus handsets like Samsung does with the gs3 or htc does with their one series there could be greater adoption</p>
<p>Hence why i hate every verge writer acts as if every skin is the bane of everyone&#8217;s existence and thus us it as a negative in a review.</p>
<p>Costs too much unlocked.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a 7-percenter!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the reasons why this release is 4.X.</p>
<p>When Google calculates the platform shares after JB is released, they can group it together with the 4.0.X numbers, thus inflating the 4.X platform share.</p>
<p>No, JB will obviously going to be different API platform and they are grouped separately from each other.</p>
<p>terrible grammar there, my bad.</p>
<p>Only minor versions are grouped together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be much higher soon. With all the One Xs, EVOs,  and Galaxy S3s out there. On top of the Nexus phones tat already have it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be*</p>
<p>Hoping they drop the source code straight away.</p>
<p>Will the Nexus S get it?</p>
<p>I think one should keep in mind that Google nixed ICS from going to the original Nexus One, officially.</p>
<p>Because the Nexus One didn&#8217;t have an ICS compatible GPU.  Nexus S should do Jellybean just fine.</p>
<p>Sadly, that is wrong. Qualcomm have released ICS compatible drivers for the development community.<br />
<a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/qualcomm-releases-adreno-2xx-gpu-binaries-for-ics/" target="_blank">http://www.xda-developers.com/android/qualcomm-releases-adreno-2xx-gpu-binaries-for-ics/</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s cool and all, but it happened <em>4 months</em> after Google open-sourced ICS.  That&#8217;s well beyond 2 years into its lifespan.</p>
<p>I think it might have been more due to the ROM storage space.</p>
<p>This. To put CM9 on a nexus One you have to reformat part of your SD card so you can install some of the ROM there because theres pretty much no built-in space. If the nexus One had no SD slot and an adequate amount of space, it&#8217;d have ICS officially.</p>
<p>Correct answer! You can put ICS on the N1, but the internal storage space is very tight when you&#8217;re all done. Pretty much everything third party has to go to SD and preferably as many non-core G-apps as you can.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t due to GPU, but rather due to internal storage space. ICS was way too much for that paltry 512MB internal storage.</p>
<p>this might be a crazy thing but here i go . IMO !!! ICS is soo much better then what iOS is .( i do use iphone 4s and one x and galaxy nexus everyday .) why not just refine ICS , make it less buggy and fix all the problems . and wait till next year to release jelly beam crack .</p>
<p>Cuz that&#8217;s is exactly what JB is going to be, hence the 4.1 designation.</p>
<p>Honestly, there really isn&#8217;t a reason for anyone to say any of the mobile operating systems are better than the other.  With Windows Phone 8&#8217;s announcement, they each serve a purpose.</p>
<p>None are better than any other, just in different spots.</p>
<p>I use Wp7, iOS and Android daily and couldn&#8217;t agree more. Each platform has their relative strengths and weaknesses and, when you get right down to it, they&#8217;re just different approaches to accomplishing the same things.</p>
<p>The way I see it, there&#8217;s no real standout among them and while I can understand why someone would have a preference for one over another, I&#8217;ll never understand how you can be a geek and limit yourself to using just one platform. I&#8217;ve got to have them all. :-)</p>
<p>What do you think is better about ICS? Anything I can think of is at best a minor bullet point and is countered by some strength iOS has in a different area.</p>
<p>fragmentation of android will always be of discussion&#8230;root your phones and install up-to-date stock roms and your problem is solved.</p>
<p>probably all phones that have ics roms should get jellybean assuming that there isn&#8217;t any further system requirements</p>
<p>you shouldn&#8217;t have to void your warranty and flash some basement dudes rom to get your phone up to date. sorry.</p>
<p>Rooting doesn&#8217;t necessarily void your warranty (I know a hell of a lot of people who have rooted and ended up having to send their phone off for repair for a non root related fault, and get the phone back with no service charge), and a lot of the &#8216;basement dudes&#8217; do development as a full time job or are doing something related at University/School.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re right, but if you&#8217;re not technically inclined to tinker with your software to make it better you should go to a closed ecosystem and and not whine about system bugs or fragmentation</p>
<p>i can do all that crap,  i used to have a nexus one and messed with it all the time. i just realized i shouldn&#8217;t have to do that stuff to get the latest firmware.</p>
<blockquote>fragmentation of android will always be of discussion…root your phones and install up-to-date stock roms and your problem is solved.</blockquote>
<p>Cool, I&#8217;ll tell my sister and mum to do that.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>if you&#8217;re sister and mum are complaining about a complex smartphone operating system then they should go to iOS..it is more user-friendly and less options in accessibility of the system files</p>
<p>your*</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not complaining about a complex smartphone OS, do you really think Android is some amazingly complex thing that only nerds can use?</p>
<p>They are complaining they they aren&#8217;t getting the &#8220;ice cream&#8221; that they&#8217;ve heard about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m betting 4.1 will hit the LTE models in custom rom form built from AOSP source long before Verizon or Sprint push it. Those of you with the hspa+ model are the fortunate sons.</p>
<p>Thats because the HSPA+ model is the TRUE Nexus.</p>
<p>Depends on how you define the Nexus brand.</p>
<p>Pure Google, no carrier branding.</p>
<p>The Sprint/Verizon ones have carrier branding and carrier files, therefore are not real.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple. Look on the back of the Nexus, if you see any carrier logo, it&#8217;s not a true nexus.</p>
<p>With the exception of the NTT Docomo-branded one that Amazon sold me a few months ago.</p>
<p>June&#8217;s gonna end with a BANG</p>
<p>I may switch from Verizon to AT&amp;T to get Jelly Bean sooner.</p>
<p>Stop whining about the fact that Jelly Bean won&#8217;t be very widespread on Android devices. Once people have ICS on their devices, a lot of fragmentation problems will be solved. Google will stop making big jumps and will improve within 4.0</p>
<p>With competition like iOS and WP8 around. Google will most certainly need to keep making big jumps. As  many as the OEMS and carriers and customers can handle. Don;t stop innovating.</p>
<p>iOS is no competition. Apple hasn&#8217;t innovated anything in five years.</p>
<p>WP8? Yes, that is serious competition, but not before fall of this year&#8230;</p>
<p>iOS is not but iPhone is. People love glass.</p>
<p>I seriously worry that iOS will start to lose ground to WP8 based on the lack of any significant improvement from 5 to 6.  They should have known that Microsoft wouldn&#8217;t sleep forever.  It&#8217;ll be a shame if they squander the golden opportunity they had.  Not because I&#8217;m some iOS fan, but because I detest Microsoft&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not really much more they can do. Same with Android, and same with later versions of WP8. They&#8217;re all starting to scrape the barrel of features.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter if iOS hasn&#8217;t &#8220;innovated anything in five years.&#8221; People are buying those things by the shit load.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure RIM thought much the same thing a few years back&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t need to innovate, if innovat</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t need to innovate when they make money by the shit ton.</p>
<p>The whole iOS platform sells off of simplicity and getting execution right, not innovation for innovation&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>What I mean is that Google has a better base with ICS than it had with Android 2.0. Now there is something you can build on without making big changens in the code!</p>
<p>I hope that the changes in this version, code wise, ain&#8217;t that much to ICS, so it&#8217;s easy for OEMs with skins on top of ICS to upgrade the devices currently running 4.0</p>
<p>By that logic, it shouldnt have taken OEMs so long to update devices from froyo to gingerbread, when in fact it took quite awhile, if it happened at all. We all need to remember that these OEM&#8217;s have little to no compulsion to update these things because theyve already made their money off of us. If we had to pay for updates, we&#8217;d all be on ICS.</p>
<p>I think the OEMs finally understand this now. We are going to see fewer phones, with better support, and better quality. They cannot compete otherwise.</p>
<p>To be fair, I don&#8217;t OEM&#8217;s were expecting Android to get so big so fast back in the Froyo/Gingerbread days.</p>
<p>Is that why Microsoft was serving Jellybeans at their Surface event?! Were they doing an inside reference that no one at the event actually got?!</p>
<p>They were poking fun at Google then, just as they were when talking about their &#8220;wallet&#8221; initiative. Also dont forget Siri&#8217;s little quip at the begining of WWDC.</p>
<blockquote>Were they doing an inside reference that no one at the event actually got?!</blockquote>
<p>Considering much of the event was populated by Tech press/writers/journalists, I think it is safe to say everyone got the joke.</p>
<p>OMG! I just drooled in my pants</p>
<p>Oh ya baby!! 4.0 hits 7.2643443%! Clearly time for a new release of an OS that none of the OEM manufactures will push to their devices. Gotta love it! Go Go Frag man!</p>
<p>Yes! You&#8217;re so right! Google should just stop working on new things all together! Way to go idea man! Why go beyond 1.0 right?</p>
<p>I like how you&#8217;re giving google stick for not having all their phone&#8217;s running the same OS but at the same time Windows aren&#8217;t updating all their phones to windows 8 even though their flagship hasn&#8217;t even been out for 6 months. And the Apple may be updating their OS for their devices, but then they limit what features they have like siri or turn by turn navigation.<br />
I mean they&#8217;ve dropped support for the ipad after two years, the lumia won&#8217;t get windows 8 but if you really want you can still update any android device yourself.</p>
<p>But, you have to remember that at least IOS updates are going out to all of their devices. They aren&#8217;t stuck and a never getting an update. Sure some devices will be limited either by processing power or simply the lack of hardware to support. Some I do believe could be a marketing ploy to say &#8220;Oh you need a newer phone or tablet&#8221;, but isn&#8217;t that what ever carrier does anyways. &#8220;You can&#8217;t have the newest OS unless you buy a new phone&#8221;.</p>
<p>IOS isn&#8217;t stammered by the carriers to decide when and/if they get an update. They have the balls to say they are and this is when to all carriers at the same time.</p>
<p>Windows Phones? Beats me&#8230;. I think that is the lamest excuse ever with their updates.</p>
<p>I do remember that, but this is kind of my point. All of them have their pros and cons, some people are mentioning that Android shouldn&#8217;t be announcing jelly bean because only like 5% of consumers are running ICS. At the same time though, you can&#8217;t do nothing and remain stagnant whilst your competition announces their plans and also it isn&#8217;t that hard to update your device if you want to (i&#8217;m  not saying you should have to go out of your way to do it yourself but until that is figured out at least that is anoption). Most people don&#8217;t notice they&#8217;re not on the most up to date version of android because they aren&#8217;t normally limited to what apps they can use (chrome being an exception) but i guarantee more people didn&#8217;t notice having siri or having navigation.</p>
<p>OMG, they&#8217;re going to decrease the screen resolution in JB!   Look at the picture.</p>
<p>Despite some people saying otherwise, I maintained that Jelly Bean would come to the Galaxy Nexus first and that &#8216;K&#8217;(thought to be Key Lime Pie at this point) would be the one to be arriving on new phone(s) in November.</p>
<p>We still seem to be on that 2 major releases a year cycle :)</p>
<p>I could obviously still be wrong, but until Andy Rubin says in an interview(or at I/O or some other Google event) that they&#8217;re going to be releasing one major update a year, I&#8217;ll stick to this thought process.</p>
<p>#supergeek</p>
<p>I reckon it will be more minor of a release  than Key Lime Pie</p>

<p>I did see that earlier. I know there is a workaround, but to me these artificial constraints are irksome.  To be honest it is what keeps me from buying this thing. I wish Apple had an <strong>&#8220;I know what I am doing mode,&#8221;</strong><em></em> so I wouldn&#8217;t feel like my hand is being held.  It is a prolonged insult.

<p>iOS 6 is zillions of years ahead of Android.Jelly Bean update won&#8217;t help at all !!!</p>
<p>Wow, how do you keep your hair up like that?</p>
<p>Can I have some of the good stuff you&#8217;re smoking</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>GizmoBoi? You comin&#8217; from Gizmodo? I just won&#8217;t feed THAT troll</p>
<p>iOS 6 is zillions of years ahead of Android.Jelly Bean update won&#8217;t help at all !!!</p>
<p>gizmodo? What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Clearly you haven&#8217;t used ICS.</p>
<p>Ok. One more time now, now with  feeling&#8230;</p>
<p>Google I/O&#8217;s going to be epic, I just hope the stuff they announce will come of  beta&#8230;</p>
<p>hope i can get this on my GN soon, so i get a chance to use it before i bin this crap for a WP8</p>
<p>Send it to me.  I&#8217;ve been too cheap to trade out my Nexus S.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll even sell it back to you after you realize you&#8217;ve been duped.</p>
<p>The wallpaper looks like some variation of the Google Play logo&#8230;</p>
<p>So Verizon&#8217;s Nexus won&#8217;t see this update till another 6 months from now. Thank goodness I installed CM9&#8230;I&#8217;ll have Jelly Bean long before any OTA is released.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not expecting much in way of UI changes outside of some touch ups and tweaking. I think they&#8217;re going to bring in more updates to Google Apps and more refinement existing features with maybe one or two surpises. It should be an interesting I/O!</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m tasting this one right </strong><br />

<p>Android 4.1 &#8211; Now requires hexa-core to run without lag.</p>
<p>what about octa-core ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read almost every comment. Sorry, but you are very very childish to defend iOS6 as if you are getting paid for it. Just chill out.</p>
<p>huh?<br />
chill dude.</p>
<p>Chill.</p>
<p>You guys just have to date each other!</p>
<p>oh look an Android lag joke.  Time travel is possible. Its 2009!</p>
<p>Android still lags you know. More than my 1 GHz single-core phone running WP7. Even though it&#8217;s not as bad as it used to be, it&#8217;s still there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg6BBZqiy18#t=10m17s" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg6BBZqiy18#t=10m17s</a></p>
<p>I get 0 lag on my Sammy Infuse running Android 4.0</p>
<p>Windows Phone lags running the most basic 3rd party apps.</p>
<p>Good luck to the S3 users, to get Jelly Bean, Samsung will have to hack the menu button back, who knows how long that will take</p>
<p>What makes you think it&#8217;ll be any different in terms of support than in ICS? Jelly bean will sill support the menu button for devices that have it just as ICS did.</p>
<p>ICS has support for it, it acts as a compliment to the ActionBar where items that &#8216;overflow&#8217; are shown. Samsung have completely removed the ActionBar and changed the entire menu system to work the old way. So they&#8217;ll have to do the same again for JB.</p>
<p>The sad thing is Google will launch 4.1 next week, and companies will still launch new phones with 4.0 well into 2013.</p>
<p>Urgh. </p>
<p>Companies will still be launching gingerbread phones in 2013. Its not ICS or JB, but at least gingerbread isn&#8217;t awful.</p>
<p>People are still releasing phones running Symbian, don&#8217;t complain&#8230;</p>
<p>It will still suck</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Am I the only one who confused Play Store with a Sony product?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll wait until Samsung specifically tell if and when will update Samsung Galaxy S III. If not I am buying HTC One X.</p>
<p>I would think twice about going to a default. HTC released ICS for its S2 equivalents the same week Samsung released the S2 ICS update.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s about time Sprint releases ICS for the GSII</p>
<p>Sprint is a CDMA carrier, CDMA carriers do not care about their customers, that is why they choose CDMA.</p>
<p>Is there a reason I can&#8217;t update my Nexus past 4.0.2 OTA? I thought the updates came directly from Google?</p>
<p>I have an unlocked phone with a pay monthly SIM, am I reliant on the network I&#8217;m using?</p>
<p>You probably aren&#8217;t running a Yakju build.  That and Takju are the only builds pushed by google.  All others are maintained by Samsung.  It is very easy to convert to Yakju however.</p>

<p>No problem. Feel free to PM me on XDA (same user name) if you run into any problems.  I&#8217;ll be glad to help.</p>
<p>Greyish search bar and new wallpaper. It is not like the homescreen needed changing in the looks department anyway. Hopefully some upgrades to the notification area and in other areas have been improved however.</p>
<p>Very much looking forward to Google I/O to see what upgrades my Galaxy Nexus is getting.</p>
<p>I can see fragmentation, I can see</p>

<p>Look carefully in the corner where the browser was on the Nexus. It doesn&#8217;t seem blue anymore. In fact, I see some hints of red, yellow, and green. Does this mean dun dun dun&#8230;. Chrome is finally the default browser. And look at the colors of the background. Maybe the UI theme is getting a slight change?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the Gmail app. Hopefully Chrome comes out of beta, though.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection you&#8217;re right. Though I also wonder why the Google Voice icon is where the messaging app used to be. I&#8217;m crossing my fingers that Voice turns into an iMessage equivalent.</p>
<p>Nice catch, I hope so too. Seems like the logical brand to compete with iMessage.</p>
<p>Test</p>
<p>Did you pass?</p>
<p>It could be Jelly Sandwich..</p>
<p>In non-USA nations a Jelly Sandwich would be pretty disgusting.<br />
Or awesome, depending on your attitude to messiness.</p>
<p>A Jelly Sandwich isn&#8217;t a dessert.</p>
<p>Nor is gingerbread, nor is honeycomb..</p>
<p>Heh, those are both desserts.</p>
<p>No they&#8217;re not, how many times have you gone to a restaurant and ordered &#8216;honeycomb&#8217; for dessert?</p>
<p>Here is a guy apparently rapping about Honeycomb desserts, please enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHp2YnOYgN4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHp2YnOYgN4</a></p>
<p>They are both types of desserts.  Gingerbread cake or cookies.  Honeycomb cake, spheres, or a type of toffee treat.  Search for it if you don&#8217;t believe me.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Nexus S will get Jelly Bean. I mean, it already got ONE major update. They need to cut off support ASAP!</p>
<p>it will get because if a device can get 4.0.x it will definitely get 4.1 &#8230; unfortunately if nexus s doesn&#8217;t get 4.1 then chances of g nex getting 5.0 would be bleak</p>
<p>Beggars can&#8217;r be choosers.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s weird in this thread is that no one is discussing JellyBean or what it could have (except Majeel), its just people nagging about fragmentation (usually people not on Android, also known as trolling)&#8230;<br />
Mattias, please make it awesome!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t really blame them&#8230; What&#8217;s the point in discussing an OS version you won&#8217;t be able to use for at least another year or so? <br />
I&#8217;m still waiting for ICS on my Note, how long will it be (if at all) for JB?</p>
<p>My galaxy tab still doesnt have ICS, gg.</p>
<p>really? my xoom has it and it&#8217;s the first every android tablet. you are missing out ICS is massive improvement.</p>
<p>Tell me about it, would have thought the Galaxy tab (probably the most popular android tablet) would have recieved it by now.</p>
<p>(Have not checked recently, still dont think its been released)</p>
<p>Nais. Might be mah next phone.</p>
<p>F U C K I N G GREY SEARCH BAR   yEAH!!!!!</p>
<p>Seriously though.  Jelly Bean should be great.  Hopefully it doesn&#8217;t take long to be a good strong JB ROM for the Verizon GN.</p>
<p>YAAY! Another Android point release that 95% of existing devices will never see &#8230;</p>
<p>Even if I agree with your premise (which I don&#8217;t), its better than 100%.</p>
<p>Surprised nobody has noticed the new UI tweaks in the Goolge IO app widget screen shot in Google Play.<br />

<p>Jelly Bean is ICS that can replace Ginger Bread</p>
<p>and that my friends is how you begin the millenniums greatest sci fi novel.</p>
<p>Not unless Schmidt forces the hardware makers to push out those updates. <br />
They won&#8217;t. They have a DISINCENTIVE to update software. Wake up.</p>
<p>&#8230; and even though all Google phones get the latest updates first, they also tend to be severely lacking in software performance and shady build quality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take my One  X and just flash Jelly Bean and still out perform the GN.</p>
<p>Any Tablet pics?</p>
<p>they both look the same</p>
<p>Wow. Really crazy that they didn&#8217;t even say why they shelved the tablet UI. I hope somebody will explain this in the following Android developer sessions.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be too hasty.  I&#8217;ve never gotten the emulator to display the tablet interface before, even in ICS</p>
<p>They showed the demo of the Nexus 7 tablet in the video and it has the phone UI.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s how it will look on 10.1in tablets.</p>
<p>yes, but it has the split-screen apps that tablets have had since honeycomb. I wouldn&#8217;t be too worried.</p>
<p>Well they said Apps have separate interfaces but the main homescreen UI and launcher appears to be the same</p>
<p>The Tablet UI never really made sense on 7&#8217; Screens, especially since those devices were always being held in Portrait.  I think for 10&#8217; screens, the tablet UI will still be there.</p>
<p>on ics i always hold it in landscape.</p>
<p>You hold the 7&quot; tablets in landscape?  I think most people do it differently.  If you look at the branding of 7&#8217; tablets or even the way its presented at places like Best Buy, its Portrait is the predominant type of usage.</p>
<p>I am sorry but I would have to disagree with you because I use the Tablet UI all the time on my Galaxy Nexus and I wouldn&#8217;t use it any other way. I it much easier to move around, shows much more information, and looks so much on the buttonless phone than the original interface.</p>
<p>I was hoping that they would go further with the Tablet UI for Jellybean because that is the only way I could ever deal with my phone.</p>
<p>You use a Tablet UI on the Nexus?  That&#8217;s wayyyy to small for me (and I would imagine most people).</p>
<p>Plus, with the Tablet UI in Portrait, you get that empty space at the top and bottom that can be really off-putting.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 is maybe too small for the tablet interface. That interface is probably reserved to the 10&quot; and up tablets in Google&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>Tab ui for apps, phone like ui for home screen and notifications; it&#8217;s a hybrid of the 2</p>
<p>Verge, this is lazy, crop out the emulator interface, please.</p>
<p>This article is about the emulator being released, not &#8220;Android 4.1 Jelly Bean in pictures&#8221;. The title is misleading, I&#8217;ll give you that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only misleading if you either:</p>
<p>A) Don&#8217;t have a brain<br />
B) Didn&#8217;t read ANYTHING to do with 4.1 and it being released as an SDK today<br />
C) All of the above</p>
<p>Seems pretty obvious to most people that this is only able to run in the emulator. I would be misleading if they cropped it out. People would be like: &#8220;Ohh! Where can I get it? Why isn&#8217;t my phone getting it? Says I&#8217;m up to date! plz help!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Your comment is</p>
<p>a) Rude.<br />
b) Condescending<br />
c) Reeks of douchiness9?)<br />
d) All of the above</p>
<p>well I agree with pbs. What he said may have been blunt but I never assumed it was 4.1 phone shots, I knew it was from the SDK, so it does not shock me and I do not call the verge lazy.  OP could just download and crop him/herself if that&#8217;s what they want</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with the OP either. I see no point in expecting the verge to crop out the marks. I just think people can be nicer, at least on the on the internet. Like you can pretend that the person you&#8217;re replying to is an incredibly hot specimen of the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Or whatever helps you be nice to fellow humans.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right. I should have been nicer. I&#8217;m just sick of self entitled twits commenting about their mental garbage disposal&#8217;s latest chum (otherwise known as &#8220;thought process&#8221;). People get this stuff for free, all day, every week, every year. These guys do a fantastic job supplying us with up to the minute news and great coverage. Just boils my blood to see someone call them lazy.</p>
<p>Bro hug, bro. Bro hug. I feel your pain. It&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s all cool.</p>
<p>Josh?</p>
<p>I hope some of the atendees will leak the &#8220;preview&#8221; OTA of Jelly Bean that came with the Galaxy Nexus they got for free.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a given.</p>
<p>You HOPE?<br />
They are surely leaking this, as Android = Anarchy = Wrongdoing</p>
<p>After all, it&#8217;s not like anyone but hard working developers ever install the betas of iOS and Mac OS X&#8230; Also, why you give anarchy a bad name? It worked in Spain.</p>
<p>Looks great. Can&#8217;t wait for the custom skins the OEMs are going to put on it&#8230; (not.)</p>
<p>Why rename it if it&#8217;s basically a point update.  Less exciting than the big iOS 6 announcement.</p>
<p>What big iOS 6 announcement? I actually think, that the &#8220;Butter&#8221; backgroud changes and Google Now with much better notifications are much bigger changes than just new Maps.</p>
<p>I agree with this. Even though there wasn&#8217;t much of a &#8220;looks&#8221; upgrade, the upgrade behind the scenes is significant enough to have this announcement at I/O.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll definitely be a worthy upgrade for Project Butter alone. It&#8217;ll be nice to have a dual core device actually seem like a dual core device, instead of random glitches and hangs and lag where there shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>There were many background changes in iOS 6 and Siri got a ton of improvements.</p>
<p>Sure. Like Apple convincing a fresh new sucker that there were a ton of improvements.</p>
<p>Exactly what I was thinking. Most of the big changes were under the hood this time around.</p>
<p>Google Now &gt; any update another mobile platform could bring out right now</p>
<p>I want what you&#8217;re smoking right now.</p>
<p>Anything that Now would recommend now.</p>
<p>So, why haven&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really a fan of this &#8220;naming&#8221;. I understand that it&#8217;s all about marketing, but this is a bit messy. as you say, it&#8217;s a .1 update, are we expected to see like 9 new &#8220;monuments&#8221; at the google backyard until the 5.0 ??? don&#8217;t think so. I understand they did it for NEXUS, so they can say it&#8217;s shipping with a completely &#8220;new&#8221; system. call me obsessive, but these unsystematic brandings are driving me nuts :) just like iPhone 3g, 3gs, 4s &#8230;aaah. just call it 2nd generation, alright? and just call the OS 4.1 . they just make customers more confused. just like mountain lion, it tries to look like a &#8220;full&#8221; 10.8, but it&#8217;s more like 10.7.5. at least they gave us hint with the &#8220;lion&#8221; name. but google, this is so messy. but maybe that&#8217;s the point of an anarchistic OS :)</p>
<p>Froyo &#8211; 2.2, GB &#8211; 2.3</p>
<p>Seems like you&#8217;re new to the Android party.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a major update, but not with a cosmetic change. Hence 4 (generally the UI designation) and 4.1 to represent a major upgrade. 5.0 will represent the next big UI switch.</p>
<p>Well, it varies. For example, each point upgrade (besides 2.0 and 2.1) had a new name up to 3.0. Then with 3.0, all versions were Honeycomb. And it was assumed they&#8217;d continue with only major releases getting a new designated desert, but they switched back to changing it each minor update. Confusing.</p>
<p>Every year is a new name, regardless. (with the exception of Honeycomb and the early days when they were iterating quicker) The number is then determined based on the amount of change in the new OS. Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Not necessarily UI switch, but a major rewrite. Just like most software numbering works.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the Froyo to Ice Cream Sandwich&#8217;s Eclair.</p>
<p>I think it was actually a similar step up akin to iOS 5 (which was a bigger update than iOS 6). No cosmetic difference, but significantly faster, has a voice assistant now, and new notifications. People would say they were disappointed if they called it Android 5.0 Jelly Bean, as it doesn&#8217;t have a cosmetic difference, but with being just a minor update, it seems huge.</p>
<p>Because it needs a new name every year!</p>
<p>Can you change it so it would emulate a 10.1 tablet and see if it&#8217;s any different?</p>
<p>&#8220;one can place a widget anywhere and whatever is in the way will move automatically&#8221;<br />
Innovation!</p>
<p>Calendar shows a tiny change, I see the day in the top right.</p>
<p>This well explains why we need a third player. Both ios6 AND Jelly Bean are just minor update.</p>
<p>Yes. Because an OS should get major changes every year. Because people love change. /s</p>
<p>Even as a WP user(camera app =P), i am very exited and i hope it will find his way to my Nexus S soon&#8230;speech assistent, recognition (offline), now, bitter&#8230;awesome stuff&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes all those features will be on the Nexus S, it won&#8217;t get an update without key features missing.</p>
<p>Performance updates are never minor</p>
<p>I like that the new wallpapers have been pared down saturation wise. I feel like the ICS were selected to scream &#8220;look at me&#8221; and were deliberately oversaturated for AMOLED screens, and made the icons too hard to distinguish.</p>
<p>The presentation looked ace.</p>
<p>that voice&#8230;.</p>
<p>What about the voice?</p>
<p>Is it Majel&#8217;s voice? That&#8217;s the most important question here.</p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>The voice was close enough to the real world Majel&#8217;s voice to set off my geek gene</p>
<p>HD Voice? Wheres Paul :-P</p>
<p>Paul is dead, remember? ;)</p>
<p>I think that voice recognition is almost there, but it&#8217;s still not working like it should be. Google Now and Siri are good stuff. On this little experience though, both apps fairly understood what the user was saying but the results were not what he expected, so now I think it&#8217;s more what to with the answers found for the question then knowing what&#8217;s being asked.<br />
Other thing, I&#8217;m an Android fan and all that, but let&#8217;s be fair, the results on Google Now are presented in a better visual way then they are on the iPhone :)</p>
<p>Lets be fair, we all need to be fair.  For all the youtube camparisons of google now vs siri, most give google the edge because it returns request faster with a clearer speaking language.  All said they expect siri to be better on its next release, bohn disagrees.  You end your thing by saying &#8220;which is the best smartphone&#8221; and siri with its robotic voice &#8220;the one your holding&#8221; that is so pathetic,  and because of that gimic siri is better, 50+ users of android disagrees.  You want some one to talk to, go get a living a breathing person.</p>
<p>Just it give it time, it&#8217;s first appearance of the technology. Siri has been public for how long?</p>
<p>8 months.  As Android fans like to point out, Voice Actions on Google were available years before Siri.</p>
<p>and Voice Action still does things Siri can&#8217;t, even after Google pioneered them</p>
<p>Yes, yes, that&#8217;s very nice. Apple released PlainTalk Speakable Items in 1993. Pretty much exactly like Voice Actions, except it was for the Macintosh. Oh, and it ran locally on the computer. It didn&#8217;t need a network connection or server cloud to function.</p>
<p>Please, let&#8217;s hear more about how Google pioneered these things.</p>
<p>Cavemen invented language. However none of this has anything to do with the first implementation on a smart phone. Which did not exist in 1993.</p>
<p>The point is that Apple was doing this stuff before Google was even a Stanford project. Locally, on a computer with a 25 MHz CPU and 8 MB of RAM, pretty puny compared to even the cheapest smartphone. And there were plenty of competitors back then, but PlainTalk was unusual in that it was free, flexible, and worked fairly well, much like Voice Actions. Google didn&#8217;t &#8220;pioneer&#8221; anything. What&#8217;s old is new again.</p>
<p>My Acer computer was doing voice commands in the early 90&#8217;s, lets not act like Apple was &#8220;pioneering&#8221; anything then either.</p>
<p>Apple makes expensive products that do less than their competitors, that&#8217;s not an opinion, it&#8217;s a fact.</p>
<p>You can write them off, but there is a lot more to a product than a bare checklist of functionality, and a lot of people clearly think so. My experience with PlainTalk left me pretty impressed. It worked remarkably well with no training at all and with a wide variety of speakers. I should know, I worked at a computer store back then, and I watched lots of people try it out with different voices and accents. I do remember it required an &#8220;AV&#8221; mac with the DSP coprocessor or a PPC.</p>
<p>You may want to review the definition of &#8220;fact&#8221; as it seems you&#8217;re not using it correctly.</p>
<p>So what, my Atari ST could do this in the 80s, it was still utterly useless.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not important who pioneered what, it&#8217;s important how to use the technology that is available now. Not important who invented and if it was in 70&#8217;s. All we need are practical stuff to help us, that&#8217;s what really matters. But between iPhone and Android I think Android used voice recognition before iOS, I could be dead wrong though.</p>
<p>Well actually, according to Wikipedia smartphones did exist then:<br />
The first smartphone was the IBM Simon; it was designed in 1992 and shown as a concept product that year at COMDEX, the computer industry trade show held in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was released to the public in 1993 and sold by BellSouth.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia&#8230;</p>
<p>Most people like to change the dates of smartphone launches.</p>
<p>In this instance, it is correct.</p>
<p>Awful strawman.</p>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s a stretch. He&#8217;s just saying that google was not the first to do voice actions. Which it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Yes, and I had speech recognition and actions on my Apricot Portable in 1984 &#8211; your point is? My Dragon and its 10MB HDD didn&#8217;t need the cloud either. FWIW; the speech recognition engine on the Apricot was made by  UK firm Dragon, which is now Nuance, which powers Siri. The real pioneers were the engineers that worked for decades to bring speech recognition to devices when nobody actually wanted it or needed it. And now their hard work is being rewarded.</p>
<p>You pretty much just made my point: Google didn&#8217;t &#8220;pioneer&#8221; any of this. It&#8217;s all been around for a very long time. And your reminder about Dragon is well-made. I used to work for one of their competitors, and Dragon was tough competition, along with IBM and Kurzweil. (BTW, thank you&#8212;I was one of those engineers. People definitely wanted speech recognition, but it wasn&#8217;t quite good enough or fast enough&#8230;yet.)</p>
<p>The Dragon founders actually started out at CMU, then joined IBM, then went solo. They provided Apricot computers with speech recognition software, but I don&#8217;t believe that Dragon itself was ever a UK company.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anybody is arguing that Google didn&#8217;t pioneer voice actions. They <em>did</em> pioneer using voice to do useful things on a smartphone.</p>
<p>After thinking about it a bit, I suppose that my real, underlying point is that smartphones have way, way more than enough hardware resources to do quality speech recognition right on the phone, with no network involved, no cloud needed.</p>
<p>It bothers me quite a bit that the modern approach of shoving the heavy lifting onto a remote server (and database where all the queries can be stored and&#8230;marketed) is completely unneeded from a technical standpoint, and is rather inelegant. It primarily serves the companies that collect the queries and the agencies interested in those queries, rather than the end users. Apple and Google are equally guilty of doing this. Sure, it allows the recognition engine to be refined and enhanced without a software  or model upgrade on the phone itself. But the approach still rubs me the wrong way.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t you get the memo, that you can do it offline in 4.1?</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, you mean the demo that Google gave earlier today of Jelly Bean&#8217;s new Offline Voice Typing speech recognition? Yes. That&#8217;s it. Nice to see. Thanks for the (cryptic) heads up.</p>
<p>The demo of Offline Voice Typing is pretty cool!</p>

<p>Reason why my company, like others, has banned the use of Siri on site.</p>
<blockquote>the speech recognition engine on the Apricot was made by UK firm Dragon, which is now Nuance</blockquote>
<p>And it also powers Google voice recognition. They pretty much power everyone now.</p>
<p>Who cares which company did it first. Both OS&#8217;s now have great voice assistants, no need to say one is better because it was first.</p>
<p>But, but&#8230; What will we argue about?</p>
<p>And the Dreamcast was doing this in &#8217;91. <br />

<p>&#8217;01 ?</p>
<p>I think the main differences here between Now and Siri is the fact that presentation of information differs (personal opinion  but I prefer Now) and the gimmicks that Siri has. I don&#8217;t really think the gimmicks are necessary.</p>
<p>The gimmicks are cute but do get tiring rather quickly.</p>
<p>Google got there first, then Apple one upped them. Now you can see with the video that Google&#8217;s new voice search is faster than Siri substantially. For me speed is a huge consideration over which is service is better.</p>
<p>Google Now == Fast, Empirical Results<br />
Siri == Slower than Google Now, Does not always deliver Empirical Results (E.g. What is the best phone?)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think google got there first. <br />

<p>The iphone was on 3G and the galaxy nexus was on wifi in the demo so that could be why is was &#8220;substantially&#8221; faster</p>
<p>When I take my Nexus off of WiFi, it switches to 4G and Google Now responds for me faster than any iPhone.  Were you just pointing out that there isn&#8217;t 4G available for iPhones?</p>
<p>Siri was actually available 2 years before it appeared in iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>It was and worked moderately well on my iPhone4.  Major piss-off when Apple cut us off :(</p>
<p>its also still a beta, so.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been my (personal and anecdotal) experience that Google doesn&#8217;t really get much slack for its software coming out in beta.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why Apple should.</p>
<p>Did anyone ask it &quot;What are the prime numbers greater than 87?&#8217; Did it come up with prime rib like Siri?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you know when mine comes. :)</p>
<p>Wait, seriously?</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/06/14/woz-poo-poos-siri-as-poo-poo-video/">Woz</a></p>
<p>It seems to dump a lot of information into the screen. Wonder how it works on a phone sized device.</p>
<p>If it looks anything like the &#8216;cards&#8217; they are using for posts in the updated Google+ app, it should be quiet usable.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t he do a head to head against the iPhone using an android phone or am I drunk?  Dont&#8217; answser taht&#8230;.</p>
<p>Ah you&#8217;re right didn&#8217;t see the last part of the video</p>
<p>He said &#8220;phone-sized&#8221;</p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>The Nexus feels better in hand than the Iphone, and it has a screen you can actually see.</p>
<p>Well, yes, a lot of iPhone features won&#8217;t help the blind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jelly Bean&#8217;s Siri competitor&#8221;</p>
<p>Also known as the evolution of a product Android has had for years, and really didn&#8217;t have anything to do with Siri coming into existence.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an Android guy, but I still agree this statement is 110% correct.</p>
<p>The title of the article is funny, but the end of the video just makes me uneasy about objectivity on this site. You can&#8217;t ask for directions to the &#8220;Mosconi&#8221; Center, have the two experiences you had there, and say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got no problems with either of those.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty big step, though. Understanding conversation isn&#8217;t even easy for people who speak other languages, let alone machines.</p>
<p>Bah, I don&#8217;t like this headline at all. Guys, it&#8217;s really not supposed to be a Siri competitor. Just like Kizipotamus said, it&#8217;s just an evolution on the Android search feature. It&#8217;s had it for years already.</p>
<blockquote>Guys, it&#8217;s really not supposed to be a Siri competitor.</blockquote>
<p>Um, did you see the side by side? They&#8217;re practically identical, I must say that Google&#8217;s implementation is way better though and even Apple fanboys must see this.</p>
<p>It is not identical. There is no character that speaks to you as if they were your friend.</p>
<p>Excellent point.</p>
<p>Android didn&#8217;t really develop voice this far until Siri came out.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m pretty impressed at how accurate and fast it is. Especially compared to the Windows Phone equivalent which is just really sad to think about.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s been working on voice for a while, just take a look at project Majel. At most Siri changed the priority voice actions got.</p>
<blockquote>Android didn’t really develop voice this far until Siri came out.</blockquote>
<p>And iOS didn&#8217;t develop Siri until after Android&#8217;s voice guided search came out.</p>
<blockquote>But I’m pretty impressed at how accurate and fast it is. Especially compared to the Windows Phone equivalent which is just really sad to think about.</blockquote>
<p>IMO WP8 might be the first mobile OS to make voice input truly useful by making the TellMe API available across all apps.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, voice input is only really a killer feature when you are in a hands-free environment (like driving a car) and to be truly useful it needs to work across the entire system.</p>
<p>That said Microsoft do need to make Local Scout voice aware, if for nothing else then to just tick off a box of what is expected in a smartphone OS.</p>
<p>WebOS is all over Jellybean&#8230; and I love it</p>
<p>now that webOS is being open sourced, Matias is having his way with his prior creations :)</p>
<p>So is Windows Phone 7 camera features&#8230;</p>
<p>WP7 camera features is<strong> all over</strong> Jelly Bean?</p>
<p>With a side of Windows Phone 7 camera features…</p>
<p>Better?</p>
<p>WP7 is all over Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>How exactly?</p>
<p>The speed of Google Now is impressive. Call me impressed.</p>
<p>Hi impressed.</p>
<p>Boooooo</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>It is a better moniker than &#8220;meow*&#8221;</p>
<p>Just to note, looks like Dieter is using wifi on the GNex and ATT on the iPhone.  Don&#8217;t think this is a true speed comparison.  Just accuracy here.</p>
<p>Get out of here with your sensible logic!</p>
<p>Seems like Dieter really wanted Siri to win. Three times he points out how &#8220;Siri won that one&#8221; but never mentions how android displays the results WAY faster, sounds more natural and doesn&#8217;t give stupid remarks.</p>
<p>OMG HE IS SO BIAS!</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>To be honest, he did Siri use cases&#8230;should have done something to control 3rd party apps. Siri would fall flat on her face.</p>
<p>Siri can do all that on iOS6</p>
<p>iOS6.<br />
Which isn&#8217;t out yet.<br />
While Google can do it now (or mid-July if you prefer to wait).</p>
<p>Yes, in mid-July it will roll out and land on 1% of Android devices at best. Much like ICS is on appx 4% after 8 months JB will be on 2% of Android devices at best by the time iOS6 is released in the Fall. So until Google addresses roll out issues announcement/release of new version of Android is anything but &#8220;now&#8221; in terms of availability to end users.</p>
<p>This argument was resolved long ago. You want Google features? Buy Google&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>So if you want Google features you have to rely on mid-range hardware. Nice one!</p>
<p>I would use no adjectives other than &#8220;high-end&#8221; to describe the Nexus line up. Even now, the Nexus S feels more solid and higher-class than many current phones. All of that has to do with software.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t interact with the CPU. You don&#8217;t look at the GPU, and you don&#8217;t listen to the memory. You interact with the software, and without the proper software, a &#8220;high-end&#8221; device will feel low end or unpolished. Software will make the high-end device high-end, and will amplify the interaction on even lower-end devices.</p>
<p>Besides, a dual-core CPU with 1 GB of RAM is more than enough to run <strong>every</strong> mobile app for the next three years, by which time <strong>anybody</strong> will be looking to upgrade their phone.</p>
<p><strong>BIASED</strong></p>
<p>Hm, is this whole &#8220;saying bias instead of biased on purpose because Josh ranted about it&#8221; already too old for anyone to remember? In that case, I do apologize.</p>
<p>It was Nilay.</p>
<p>Or Nilay. Wasn&#8217;t sure, thanks for pointing that out.</p>
<p>yeah i noticed that also&#8230;its true.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the GNex was on wifi and the iPhone was on 3G, we even saw the wifi popup appear on the iPhone in the video. Granted, it could have been hotel wifi and complete garbage, but who knows</p>
<p>What are these &#8220;pop ups&#8221; that you speak of and why aren&#8217;t they blocked?  I&#8217;ve had a pop-up blocker on my web browser for years because no matter what popped up, it was always in the way of whatever I was doing.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>Woosh.</p>
<p>Actually, look closer/turn the video on high quality and full screen; the iPhone was on 4G.</p>
<p>Iphone&#8217;s don&#8217;t have 4G&#8230;</p>
<p>They have HSPA+ which is considered &#8220;4G&#8221; on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Yeah but AT&amp;T is full of s*** so &#8230;</p>
<p>It was on 4G buddy.</p>
<p>The most noticeable to me was the cinema times, JB was pretty much instant where siri had to open the browser and slowly load results, I go to the cinema a lot so that will come in handy!</p>
<p>Apple did show off movie times for iOS6 so this fall will be a good battle between the two.<br />
One thing to note though, Apple upgrades Siri like it does it&#8217;s other apps with an iOS update only. Google will most likely just keep upgrading Voice Search without saying anything.</p>
<p>Seriously.  Every time he said &#8220;They both handled that well&#8221; I was like, yea, but the Nexus handled it in about a third of the time . . . .</p>
<p>I think Dieter is sexually involved with Siri, giving her undeserved praise and promotions.</p>
<p>Clearly they are being payed by apple and google is better at all the things.</p>
<p>I would be willing to bet the speed involved has a lot more to do with the fact that it isn&#8217;t serving many queries given the extremely small number of devices in the wild able to access it.  Compare that to the 10&#8217;s of millions of iOS devices accessing Siri on a regular basis therefore causing the Apple servers to deal with a much heavier load.</p>
<p>It will be hard to truely compare the two products until Now is released to the public on a wide scale, and by then iOS 6 will be here and will feature an improved version of Siri so the comparisons will be quite different.</p>
<p>Oh wow logic and it goes completely ignored with no props at all until now.</p>
<p>Might I add to your insight that it appeared that Siri was pulling answers directly from a knowledge base more often, while Now was simply doing a web search. Of course it will take longer to access a knowledge base.</p>
<p>Can you add calendar events through Google Now&#8217;s voice thingy?</p>
<p>This is what I am wondering.</p>
<p>zou can with S Voice  :-)</p>
<p>At least Google did a completely different approach than Samsung&#8217;s crap S voice&#8230;Which looks like a complete siri ripoff</p>
<p>Hey if it works, it works. Bashing it as a copy doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t work well.</p>
<p>S Voice is crap for speed though. Total and utter crap.</p>
<p>google now is much faster than siri</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s cloud dwarfs iCloud</p>
<p>Yeah, the results came much more quickly in most cases. I&#8217;m excited to see how it improves.</p>
<p>The difference is that there are millions of people using Siri compared to the 100 or so people using Google Now.</p>
<p>What about the billion or so using Google Search which is what Google Now is based on?</p>
<p>Billion?  Definitely a master of the understatement &#8230;. :)</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions would be perfectly accurate, and Billions might not be so far off. This is Google we&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Um how many people are using google search, where Google now is getting its information. Siri was always slow</p>
<p>No, it wasn&#8217;t. If you look at early videos of Siri when it was for developers only it was quick. Once everyone started using it slowed down to what you see in the video.</p>
<p>But it can work offline, so it may not even be connected to Google&#8217;s servers and instead is processing all the voice on the phone.</p>
<p>Not entirely doubting that, but Siri was running on AT&amp;T whereas the Nexus was over wifi — not an accurate matchup in terms of speed.</p>
<p>but the 4s has the 4G!!!</p>
<p>/s     :O</p>
<p>He&#8217;s on Wifi, but wherever he&#8217;s staying, their internet could likely be bogged down by all the IO attendees.. But that&#8217;s not the point I came to make. I just wanted to point out that Google can now do speech recognition without data, so that certainly speeds things up.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an excellent observation.</p>
<p>How long before we learn Google Now &#8220;accidentally&#8221; includes Chrome incognito searches to give you &#8220;relevant&#8221; information?</p>
<p>how would that happen? The first thing it says on incognito mode is that it doesnt save any of your searches or anything else you do, besides downloads</p>
<p>Do you even know what Chrome&#8217;s incognito feature is?</p>
<p>Quite sure Google will make several improvements and Google now will be a major deal in the months to come&#8230;cant wait for my touchpad to get JB</p>
<p>That&#8217;s some ugly-ass looking tablet.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re crazy</p>
<p>don&#8217;t feed the troll</p>
<p>Opinions differ.<br />
Go troll elsewhere.  This bridge is taken.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lenscrafters.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lenscrafters.com/</a></p>
<p>Troll food of the century! Bravo! :-)</p>
<p>Did your phone come preloaded with Jellybean or did you have to download the update?</p>
<p>Everyone at I/O got a Galaxy Nexus, a Nexus 7 and a Nexus Q and I guess that&#8217;s the Galaxy Nexus unit preloaded with JB ;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that their Galaxy Nexuses came with ICS on them but there&#8217;s an OTA update coming later today for them to update to JB.</p>
<p>Siri got killed!! Dieter was pulling for Siri&#8230;.every time Siri won something he would say Siri handled that well.</p>
<p>This was iOS 5 Siri btw&#8230;.</p>
<p>I doubt iOS 5s will be much different.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus was connected to WiFi whereas the iPhone was connected to AT&amp;T&#8217;s 3G.  This was a test on accuracy and not on speed, since their differing connections makes it an unfair race.</p>
<p>Sir I got destroyed in accuracy&#8230;.is that better?</p>
<p>Looks like you may need to add &#8220;Siri&#8221; to your autocorrect dictionary.</p>
<p>DYAC!</p>
<p>Can this be used to set reminders? This is the only thing voice is useful for. Everything else is a gimmick. Although i really like the live card system.</p>
<p>So what kind of tech does Google use to give Now a more natural sounding voice?</p>
<p>I would like to know this as well. I wish the voice was less bitchy, but it&#8217;s still very natural. Also the search results are extremely quick. I&#8217;m an Apple user, and even though this provides competition, judging from the past, Apple will be slow to make Siri better.</p>
<p>I thought apple was doubling down on siri next?</p>
<p>They bought(what seems) to be the technology behind this from a company in Oxford(UK) a couple of years back. Fire up Translate for Android and put hi-quality network(or whatever they call it) speech on. It sounds incredible.</p>
<p>The technology allows the artificial creation of natural-sounding speech in a given voice after the real person has said a few hundred words. Then it can just make whatever text is created sound like that person.</p>
<p>Guys, you went from a terrible player to a even worse one. Just use the YouTube stock player and it will be fine!</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve been staring in wonderment as The Verge goes from widely compatible, geek-friendly HTML Video goodness to decent looking Flash player to horrible looking Flash player with a gigantic Flash ad blocking half of the main page (until I actively dismiss it, since I have Flashblock). It&#8217;s quite puzzling.</p>
<p><strong>Protip: for much better voice recognition for those with not-so-clear voices (like myself), turn on &#8220;Personalized Results&#8221; in the Voice search settings. Results will drastically improve.</strong></p>
<p>Er, I mean &#8220;Personalized Recognition&#8221;</p>
<p>System settings &gt; Language and Keyboard &gt; Speech &#8211; Voice Search</p>
<p>Yup, great tip that not many people know about.</p>
<p>So&#8230; anyone else think Google Now will be the main interface for Google Glass?</p>
<p>I really liked it. As I absolutely don&#8217;t mind Google knowing everything about me (no sarcasm) I&#8217;ll really enjoy this. I just hope it&#8217;ll work properly outside the US, unlike Siri. Knowing Google it might just work, they like to do things properly.</p>
<p>ohhhh jeeeeezus</p>
<p>You got me really excited with this title. how&#8217;s this Siri competitor? it&#8217;s crap! google search with voice. that&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p>Not sure if serious.</p>
<p>explain to me how is this in any sense clever? It&#8217;s google voice search! can it arrange appointments, read text, send email? Goolge now is not an assistant like Siri is.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s wrong to compare them in that sense. they are two different product, except that they both do voice search.</p>
<p>Google voice search has always been able to add appointments, send sms, send emails, etc.</p>
<p>Old voice actions I would have agreed on that. But this one integrates some of the immediate responses you get from google search (e.g. movies an actor was in, conversions that siri delegates and silently shows wolfram alpha for, world times) and speaks them out, putting it closer to siri&#8217;s level.</p>
<p>The issue though is that siri makes money from iphone sales. google makes money from ads. If too many people end up using Google now instead of the regular page&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, Google needs help with naming</p>
<p>Haha they did misstep on naming this. Other name, they&#8217;ve done well, e.g., Android names and Project Butter.</p>
<p>In that video, were you serious when testing the Nexus vs the iPhone?  The Nexus was CLEARLY better, and then you end on a couple &#8220;cutesy&#8221; voice input things that Siri has responses for, but no iPhone owner ever repeats after the first week with the phone.</p>
<p>The Nexus was on a WiFi connection whereas the iPhone was on At&amp;T&#8217;s 3G.  This means that the Nexus would no matter what be faster.  The test was about accuracy, not speed.</p>
<p>What 4 times as fast. Come on&#8230;</p>
<p>If your wifi is as fast as AT&amp;t 3G you probably need to get that checked out.</p>
<p>I think part of the speed is due to Now having an offline speech engine.</p>
<p>It very CLEARLY says 4g on the iPhone right next to AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Google Now/Voice (whatever it is called) answers the questions way faster and without irritating excessive remarks w/c Siri does. I like it actually. I&#8217;m glad that Google is giving focus again on its voice search. It&#8217;s not perfect but I can already see the big improvements. And the UI looks better than that of Siri.</p>
<p>Google Now is just a voice search. Siri is also your assistant and can arrange meetings, send /read text, etc.</p>
<p>wrong. Google voice action already does meeting arrangement, send text and whatnot in the older version of android.<br />
They just put google now on top of it</p>
<p>You are entitled to your beliefs.<br />
I will not try to change them.<br />
I will not point out they are even somehow wrong.<br />
You are allowed to have yours, no matter how misguided and uninformed most feel they be.</p>
<p>If you could read this reply, my mistake.  It was mistakenly left out of the fine print.</p>
<p>agreed, Google now seems like the grownup in the room. Siri just talks way too much and has an annoying voic.e. No wonder so many people hate it.</p>
<p>You have Google Go on the phone already?  I guess that means you got the Jellybean OTA&#8230;..any way you can post a link to the OTA download?</p>
<p>The voice processing is really nice. Way more natural than Siri.</p>
<p>Sure would be nice to know what else GNow can do.</p>
<p>Hey Dieter, can it arrange calendar appointments and open apps?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it should be able to do some of these things since these features are found in Voice Actions already.</p>
<p>A bit of clarification would go a long way.</p>
<p>Google Now seems to generally be a lot faster than Siri, anyway.</p>
<p>Im so sick of every tech blog comparing voice software to Siri. Siri FOLLOWED google voice. Basically ( As usual) adding to a feature that already existed on Android. Im not a fanboy but you people need a little more DEPTH in your reporting so you dont feed the trolls.</p>
<p>Siri was on iOS as a standalone app for years before Apple bought them. iOS also had voice actions since iOS 2</p>
<p>Everyone is comparing cause it is a major competitor, doesn&#8217;t really matter who does it first.<br />
It is more important that which is better, faster and more accurate.</p>
<p>Unscientific so I&#8217;ll just say this sounded BIASED. There I said it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not as much things you can ask google now than siri for now but for what you can, now is way faster.</p>
<p>I must have been watching the wrong video because I repeatedly saw an old hag named Siri consistently getting beaten.</p>
<p>Few things:<br />
1. Did anyone notice how slow the siri response was compared to google now? I&#8217;m assuming both are connected to wifi.<br />
2. How the heck does Google made the response voice sounds so&#8230;human? With project glass, neural network simulator and this, skynet is not too far away.<br />
3. Woodchuck test please!</p>
<p>Indeed, the voice was very natural.  Did you notice how the voice switched to a robotic voice during the keynote demo?  Now that was cool.</p>
<p>heh? really? i haven&#8217;t watch the keynote video yet</p>
<p>Yeah, they asked it a computer/robot related question and it responded in an appropriate voice.</p>
<p>maybe it&#8217;s a new capability to disguise itself as siri to infiltrate apple HQ</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think the screen will shrink that far :D</p>
<p>I wish this type of Assistant was truly touch-free. I like the implementation of waving hands over the camera (or it could be a proximity sensor) to initiate the interaction. Not sure how it would affect the battery life though.﻿</p>
<p>With Siri you can just raise the phone to your ear and speak, the proximity sensor and acceleromoter activates Siri</p>
<p>Useful, but not touch free though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure with access to the APIs though we could see this happening.</p>
<p>Even Waze is touch free for some things. You can wave your hand over it and then tell it to drive home. I am sure with an upgrade or so it Now will be awaiting your voice or wave as well.</p>
<p>Vlingo is touch free. You just need to call for it and it pops up&#8230;</p>
<p>hmm, The Verge video player only buffers few seconds ahead  &gt;:(</p>
<p>They traded in the Accord for a recently restored Yugo.  Wonder why&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  They seemed pretty evenly matched, maybe even a slight lead to google now.  Though, the answer of &#8220;Who is the president of the united states of america&#8221; is a bit funny.  Siri gave you the person, now gave you the band.  I guess they should listen for &#8220;who are the pres&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Google Now is building on Voice Actions,  and leaves out the gimmicks. Sounds good.</p>
<p>from what i gathered, siri can handle more natural speaking situations (and you can dick around with ridiculous questions), but googles looks like it is much quicker. It had the results by the time the other siri was still recognizing speech. Is this cause the googles new offline speech recognition?</p>
<p>3G vs wifi</p>
<p>did they really test it like that? it looks like your right, though it looks like they are on hspa+. They should have done em both wifi though.</p>
<p>but we know that Siri has a lot of help from humans programming &#8220;fun&#8221; pre prepared responses. Google is huge on not doing things like that. They don&#8217;t pre-prepare canned responses. They let their software and algorithms figure things out and give you the most accurate response.</p>
<p>For a few cutsie things, the canned responses are momentarily entertaining, but when you really want to find out real information, Google&#8217;s approach is far better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even a competition to me. Google Now makes Siri look like the toy that it is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised Apple hasn&#8217;t made any purchases around this.<br />
It is becoming a marquis feature &#8211; Siri I mean.<br />
And if I recall correctly it rests squarely on two technologies owned by companies other than Apple.<br />
Nuance does the speech realization.<br />
And Wolfram Alpha does the searching/answering.</p>
<p>Google may be a little behind but it does own its own technologies from what I recall anyway.</p>
<p>Marquis?<br />
It&#8217;s not bad but not great.  If Google can get it to where it is correct 80%+ range it will be very useful.  That is my biggest issue with Siri and Google Voice.  They are wrong or cannot understand often enough that I don&#8217;t use them routinely.</p>
<p>&#8216;marquee&#8217; is what I was going for.<br />
LOL.<br />
What I don&#8217;t know about words could fill a book &#8211; a dictionary.</p>
<p>I agree that they are not reliable enough to be really super useful yet for many as it is a bit of a gamble whether it will save you time or cost it in correction.<br />
Either way &#8211; Siri is an oft quoted and referenced feature.<br />
Enough so that any similar technology is automatically compared.<br />
In that way it has indeed become a marquee feature for Apple.</p>
<p>San Fran is going to be a mess tonight when all these people get hammered and stumble around into each others rooms changing the music lineup.</p>
<p>I so want to see the party pics and vids!     :O</p>
<p>Party Mode &#8230;..</p>
<p>To me, it seemed Google Now completely dominated in design and useful information. Siri just seems like the kid that never grew up.</p>
<p>This shows a good comparison of the two.. personal Siri is killing it imo.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/YN8G5" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/YN8G5</a></p>
<p>All fan-boism aside, the commentator in this video seemed to really favor siri, going as far as including two searches he knew would give entertaining(though time-wasting and un-needed(i mean who needs a taxi when they are trying to<em> find </em>a bar to get really wasted at?)) responses.</p>
<p>It looked like Now handled things faster and with greater relevance than Siri to me, but I get the wifi vs 4g connection thing, and wish that Deiter just had them both on wifi.</p>
<p>Honestly I get an app talking to me for turn based navigation, or if I&#8217;m blind or driving, but search apps should just STFU.</p>
<p>pretty much totally agree here. iOS looks so dated to me now compared to JB.</p>
<p>But is it still a largely useless gimmick?</p>
<p>How many languages &#8220;now&#8221; undestand? Don&#8217;t tell me is like Google Play, only for US</p>
<p>Just wanted to point out something that has been buried in replies concerning the speed of Now vs. Siri:</p>
<p><strong>The nexus is connected to wifi while the iPhone is on 3G</strong></p>
<p>4g, but yeah&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;4G&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>If Apple advertises it as such, can you really complain about it?</p>
<p>Yeah that&#8217;s 3G</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to get annoyed with The Verge. The always comparing to Apple products in every article. And now, the way this article says as if Apple/Siri is the first to do this and making it look like Google copied this feature.</p>
<p>Google have Voice Actions since Eclair 2.1</p>
<p>If I had to boil it down to a sound bite, it seems like Google Now was faster, but Siri smarter&#8230;</p>
<p>Siri uses Wolfram Alpha for anything that appears smarter. Soon, Google will be a lot like Wolfram alpha in terms of general information (but not as advanced in mathematics and science).</p>
<p>I honestly can&#8217;t believe this guy thought that Siri was better. Am I taking crazy pills? The Android results were way faster and just nicer looking. Siri voice is annoying and talks way too much.</p>
<p>I honestly hate Apple and IOS and I am ALL for Android however the voice test isn&#8217;t really fair. They both use the data connection to look up info and the Nexus was on Wifi while the Iphone was only on the network. I enjoy fair competition even though I know Android is superior anyway.</p>
<p>See this comparison and the clear winner is very obvious:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=kDsOtdRtG0Q" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kDsOtdRtG0Q</a></p>
<p>Is it just me or the video is not playing on chrome for iPad?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty slick on my Nexus S. I put in an event on Google Calendar to see The Dark Knight Rises with some friends (including the address) and with about 40 minutes until the movie started it automatically notified me and gave me suggestions of what buses to catch and how long it was going to take. My mind was blown.</p>
<p>These manufacturers better hope Google calls Android 4.2 &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221; when they release it on the 29th.</p>
<p>When will they learn&#8230;.</p>
<p>They make beautiful phones, but as long their software updates are going this slow I won&#8217;t buy anything else but a Nexus.</p>
<p>The majority of people don&#8217;t care about these things. Apple is amazing, like really amazing at updating iphones, yet ios has huge fragmentation (not as big as android, naturally) because people dont care about updating their phones/ don&#8217;t know how to update their phones, don&#8217;t realise the benefits of updating their phone.</p>
<p>iOS doesn&#8217;t have huge fragmentation. Fragmentation is an issue where the vendor or app developers can&#8217;t roll out updates across devices because older hardware doesn&#8217;t support it. So you end up with a bunch of different devices all running different legacy software and no ability for an app developer to target a single OS version.</p>
<p>With iOS the majority of Apple&#8217;s phones run iOS 6. For an app developer you need only build your app for iOS 6 in the knowledge that nearly everyone can download it. Even Apple&#8217;s 2009 model, the 3GS runs iOS 6.</p>
<p>Having different handsets with different features (HD video recording not being on the 3GS, Panorama not being on the 4 etc etc) doesn&#8217;t pose an issue for the OS vendor, app developers or the users who receive software updates and who want to buy new apps.</p>
<p>Feature differentiation doesn&#8217;t equal fragmentation.</p>
<p>You miss the point entirely.</p>
<p>And btw i agree with most of what you said.</p>
<p>Your post is 3 paragraphs long about how fragmentation is not an issue, (which i agree with) my post was about that regardless of it theres updates available, people generally don&#8217;t. Hence why apple, who is the king of updates, still has pretty huge fragmentation, when it shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Sorry, you&#8217;re wrong:<br />
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/study-europeans-quickest-to-adopt-ios-6-overall-updates-growth-continues/" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/study-europeans-quickest-to-adopt-ios-6-overall-updates-growth-continues/</a></p>
<p>Thanks, your article just proved my point.</p>
<p>The artictle says that users are on many different versions of IOS, millions and millions of people didnt bother to update</p>
<p>so you are the one see glass half empty while others see half full :)</p>
<p>Lol yes i suppose it sounds that way, I think we have gotten a little side tracked here, the point was about that most people don&#8217;t care about these things, i used apple as an example because they are the best in the buisness at keeping their tech up to date, yet even when updates are available, people still dont bother updating.</p>
<p>This to me prooves 2 things, firstly most people dont care about updates and for those people, this announcement by sony is a non issue.</p>
<p>The second thing is that if people care about updates, then they should stick to either GSM nexus phones, or iphones, as no other phone gets the latest updates in a timely fashion for the 2 year length of a contract, and even when its an LTE nexus, the carriers still manage to screw things up.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t criticise a company or operating system for fragmentation if said fragmentation is down to user choice.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the people who haven&#8217;t upgraded to iOS 6 are people who didn&#8217;t want to. That&#8217;s their choice, and it&#8217;s their choice to make.</p>
<p>It is to be distinguished from users not having the choice to upgrade at all, a la Android.</p>
<p>That 50% of all iOS users have already upgraded despite concerns over the maps application, in the space of less than a month &#8211; proves the reverse of what you claim &#8211; that people very much do care about software upgrades. And if all of those people can suddenly only choose a Nexus device (and even then upgrades are delayed) suddenly Android becomes almost as choice restricted as iOS.</p>
<p>Also, those who don&#8217;t care for now, will care once they are denied an app because it requires them to update; which they then will.</p>
<p>the big difference is: while you can just write iOS 6 apps <em>already</em>, Android devs still need to write 2.3 apps because there&#8217;s just too many devices out there that couldn&#8217;t be updated to 4.0, even if they users decided they wanted to.</p>
<p>Yes but that doesnt happen, if your phone is not compatible with an app, as in the app is for jellybean devices only, then it doesnt even show up in the store.</p>
<p>The only way someone would know about the app in question is if they see it on someone elses jellybean phone, when they would realise that its not available for their phone, which is acceptable because they have different phones. People do have this realisation that because they have different phones, that doesnt mean they can have all the same apps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue that apple&#8217;s system is worse in the fact that they give different phones the same OS number, and thus even when there on the same OS, they cant have all the same apps, for example siri and maps etc,</p>
<p>You win for best spin.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s system is worse in the fact that 3 year old phones receive the same API level as the most current phone, gotcha.</p>
<p>Spin Master, teach us your craft won&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Can you not read?</p>
<p>Where did i blame Apple for people not updating?</p>
<p>my whole point is that alot of people don&#8217;t care about updates and thus even when updates are available, they don&#8217;t update.</p>
<p>It seems am being trolled by apple fans, for just backing up my point with evidence. I only used apple as an example, because they are the best at updating their tech (a point i have made several times now) However since my point is that even when updates are available, people still don&#8217;t update.</p>
<p>there&#8217;s a lesson to be learned here. If you mention Apple in a comment that does not praise Apple or criticize Android, expect to be trolled by iFanboiz. That&#8217;s how it works<br />
:)</p>
<p>I will forever quote this <strong>&quot; if all of those people can suddenly only choose a Nexus device (and even then upgrades are delayed) suddenly Android becomes almost as choice restricted as iOS.&quot;</strong> Thank you for this.</p>
<p>Sorry, you&#8217;re wrong. Again.</p>
<blockquote>The <strong>majority</strong> of people don’t care about these things</blockquote>
<p>The article clearly shows that in just 3 weeks about 50% already updated their phone to the latest version and that percentage keeps growing at a steady pace.<br />
Clearly <strong>the majority</strong> cares.</p>
<p>yes but your assuming that just because they have updated, that they care about said update. there&#8217;s alot of people out there who update because they get a notification telling them they should, that doesnt mean they care about the update.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re assuming people who don&#8217;t buy Nexus phones don&#8217;t care about updates. The bigger problem is that Android devs can&#8217;t target the latest release, since there aren&#8217;t many phones on it. They have to target 2.3. iOS devs can targe iOS 6, since it&#8217;s on the majority of phones in less than a month already.</p>
<p>well its a developer phone, i doubt many people buy it to just use it as any old phone, a point proven that it has very small sales compared to the GS3.</p>
<p>So what is the advantage of building apps for 4.1 compared to 2.3? what functions in the app am i loosing out on?</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m not an Android developer, I can&#8217;t say for certain, but each revision introduces a large number of APIs that allow for apps to do more/better/faster things. If the majority of your target base isn&#8217;t on the latest update, you have to code for a lower API level. So apps can&#8217;t take advantage of all the cool stuff that ICS and JB have to Oder, songs so few people can actually use those apps.</p>
<p>Someone above wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>my post was about that regardless of it theres updates available, people generally don’t. </blockquote>
<p>Yup, it was you. It&#8217;s hard to argue when you keep changing the subject but I guess the main point of my reply is that contrary to your opinion, iOS does not suffer from huge fragmentation and the charts above present facts to back my statement. <br />
Your assumption was wrong, it doesn&#8217;t make you a bad person but at least admit you were.</p>
<p>I just have to jump in and stand up for Mintvilla a bit. I think what he was talking about was not the &#8220;fragmentation&#8221; itself but peoples view of said &#8220;fragmentation.&#8221;  I think fragmentation was not the best word to use, but I do see his point&#8230; I know quite a few people who own an iPhone who do not use it for anything else but making phone calls and texting. Those individuals would never know/care if there was an update.<br />
You guys definitely need to take it down a notch, no need to fill this whole comment thread trying to prove MintVilla wrong.</p>
<p>He said it himself:<br />
<blockquote>However since my point is that <strong>even when updates are available, people still don’t update.</strong></blockquote></p>
<p>Facts proved him wrong&#8230; he just won&#8217;t admit it. <br />
Sure, many won&#8217;t ever update their phones, but the majority have already done so.</p>
<p>Fragmentation is when my app which is abasically a Listbox crashes on HTC phones but works on everything else.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if Google stopped releasing updates to Android. Then, within a year or two, all the phones would have the latest software.</p>
<p>That would suck. Tremendously.</p>
<p>Why, what features do you miss right now?</p>
<p>Read this thread <br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/18/3523390/android-4-2-wishlist" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/18/3523390/android-4-2-wishlist</a></p>
<p>Hardly any game-changing features that would require a whole new OS version. Unless you count all the 200 code changes and call them new features ;)</p>
<p>To be clear, I was joking about Google not releasing new versions; however I expect that the incremental value that they would add will be less and less with the maturation of Android.</p>
<p>You get people trying to claim both.</p>
<p>In this very thread you have fanboys saying that nobody cares about software updates, and others claiming how important and revolutionary they are.</p>
<p>They are either big improvements or not. If they are, people will care if they aren&#8217;t given access. If they aren&#8217;t, then Android as an OS looks stagnant. Either way, it&#8217;s a loss for the customer with the current upgrade cycles.</p>
<p>Android can afford to stagnate for a while without looking any worse than the competition. No loss for the customer.</p>
<p>I dunno, a lot of the stuff in that Verge thread that was linked is stuff that other OSes had years ago. I don&#8217;t think Google can afford to stagnate when they&#8217;re missing so much incredibly basic shit like having all your icons be the same size.</p>
<p>huh? what other &#8220;basic shit&#8221;  is Goog missing from Android that other OSes have had for years?<br />
just curious..</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually one of the reasons I hope that starting with 2013, Google will only release one major version of Android every year. It&#8217;s too difficult for manufacturers to upgrade all their phones to <strong>two</strong> versions of Android every year. If it was just one it would be a lot easier. Plus, if they did just one ugprade every year, most users wouldn&#8217;t be 2 versions behind, because another version was just released 6 months back, like it happens now.</p>
<p>It would also be easier for Google to work with manufacturers a few months ahead of the release to release some devices in the same time with the new version (with the help of the PDK, etc). If everyone gets early access 2-3 months before the public release, then we could expect a lot more phones to come out with that version in the same time.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I hope the Nexus program is real, and Google would handle all the upgrades for everyone who decides to make a Nexus/stock Android phone. But they need to do it for 2 years and/or all new Android 4.x devices need to be upgraded up to Android 6.0. All Android new 5.x devices need to be upgraded up to Android 7.0, and so on.</p>
<p>ICS came out in late 2011. JB came out around the same time. They DO only do one version a year.</p>
<p>Same time this year, I mean.</p>
<p>Just the named versions, 2009: Cupcake, Donut, Eclair; 2010: Froyo, Gingerbread; 2011: Honeycomb, ICS; 2012: Jelly Bean, (expected) Key Lime Pie. That&#8217;s at least two versions/year for the last 4 years.</p>
<p>Now go troll somewhere else.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>The joke&#8217;s on them, i don&#8217;t have an android.</p>
<p>Those Nexuses can&#8217;t come soon enough.</p>
<p>Sony did a pretty good job on the updates for ICS. Especially considering a lot of their 2011 line of phones were on single core processors. It&#8217;s better than a lot of the other Android OEMs.</p>
<p>You mean all of their 2011 phones were on single-core processors.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>A lot of Sony Fanbois keep proclaiming that Sony is the best android manufacterer on updates. In fact the best android manufacterer on updates are Asus, however they have a limited array of products. Considering that, Samsung is the one that most frequently updates a larger array of devices then others.</p>
<p>Sorry for a somewhat poor English &#8211; Norwegian fag.</p>
<p>Samsung is also pretty good at minor updates (bug fixes, performance and battery improvement..etc).  HTC for example spent too much time before fixing the one x&#8217;s gigantic number of bugs (sd size shrinking, screen flicker, lag, multitasking, stupid software menu button &#8230;)</p>
<p>Samsung is pretty good at updating their top-tier devices. Their lower and mid-end devices however are still running 2.3.6 with bugs all around them. Sony has a better reputation in that regard, since all (also the lower end) their devices run 4.0.</p>
<p>This.  Exactly.   If you have samsung anything other than a premier flagship phone&#8230;.  No updates for you.  You are lucky to get bug fixes on a timely basis.</p>
<p>But would you want/need updates if you did not have a flagship phone? I don&#8217;t think so. Certainly, my mother with a Galaxy Ace does not give a hoot about updating her software. Nor does she see anything wrong with it as it stands (opposed to myself&#8230;).</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus (2011), Galaxy Note (2011) and Xperia Ray (2011) owner here.  I was personally happy and surprised to get ICS on the Ray.  The primary benefit for me is being able to run Chrome.</p>
<p>Would Jelly Bean be nice? Yes. Necessary on a 2-yr-old phone, not really. The Ray already punches above it&#8217;s weight class.</p>
<blockquote>But would you want/need updates if you did not have a flagship phone? I don’t think so.</blockquote>
<p>Why the fuck not?</p>
<p>For starters, if you want updates, fork out more money. Don&#8217;t be cheap.</p>
<p>Any update I have to do using samsung&#8217;s kies software is not an update at all in my mind. That piece  of ass is worse than iTunes, and that&#8217;s quite a criticism.</p>
<p>Kies 2 is not so bad. I am lucky that I use something called Odin for my nefarious updates&#8230;.</p>
<p>and most Samsung updates, if not all, are OTA now anyway</p>
<p>Sony does a good job updating their phones and even though Xperia U and Sola are not going to be upgraded this is probably caused by little amount of RAM. Jelly Bean, although pretty smooth in operation on low end phones has trouble keeping apps open on 512MB devices. Google Now, a major feature of JB is very resource intensive. The reasoning for 2011 Xperia devices is likely the same.</p>
<p>My Nexus One is running Jelly Bean and Google Now is nowhere resource intensive.</p>
<p>The Nexus S has the same amount of RAM.</p>
<p>Yes, but these are &#8220;stock&#8221; jellybean&quot; these phones your on about would need a skinned jellybean version, which naturally requires more than plain stock</p>
<p>Sony&#8217;s skins are not that heavy. But even if they were, the solution is simple: ditch the skin.</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;d rather have a skin that let&#8217;s take advantage of manual camera settings, better media player and calendar apps (things I use every day) on ICS than Jelly Bean (Galaxy Nexus owner). These skins have their benefits.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;ve seen how it runs? While it&#8217;s buttery smooth in many places the are many drawbacks. Apps are killed often due to low memory and are quite slow to start again. We&#8217;re talking few seconds to load basic apps like Phone, People etc.</p>
<p>Sony actually was starting to do good though, at last with their ICS updates. I&#8217;ve never owned a Sony device, but I was considering one. Not anymore though. The only devices I&#8217;ll ever buy from an OEM are Nexus devices.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even think Asus is good with updates. They, Samsung, and basically every other OEM updates their phones way after the latest version is available. Asus could update theirs even faster considering they barely skin anything. Samsung updates take even longer than Asus, so no, they suck too. The only updates Samsung push out in a decent timeframe are bugfixes and the like (which is most likely due to all their TouchWiz crap).</p>
<p>There is not a single Android OEM that pushes out timely updates. Not one.</p>
<p>My friend has an xperia neo and his phone became totally inusable after the ics upgrade. He totally wish he could get back to gingerbread (I failed convincibg him to root). I bet that even if sony gave it a jellybean update he won&#8217;t install it anyway &#8230;</p>
<p>Xperia U is very much capable in terms of hardware. Sony is just lazy..<br />
Whatever happened to that 18 month support program??</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it. That might sound cynical, but there have been plenty of announcements about upgrades that never happened. Sony has been a lot better than most manufacturers about upgrading Android versions though.</p>
<p>At least the upgrade from 4.0 to 4.1 is not as big from 2.3 to 4.0</p>
<p>My Nexus S runs 4.1.2.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>Is anyone surprised by this? History has shown that if you buy an Android last year you won&#8217;t get this years updates… it is that simple.</p>
<p>When I owned the HTC Hero&#8230; at first it was denial, then anger, came acceptance, then XDA.</p>
<p>in the end&#8230;mine got 2.X without XDA, but the wait was painful</p>
<p>when you buy an Android this year, you get last year&#8217;s software, get upgraded to this year&#8217;s software some time next year, miss out on anything beyond that.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s a shame really :(</p>
<p>then again, most people who don&#8217;t buy a Nexus device obviously don&#8217;t care about software versions anyways. It&#8217;s less the customer than rather the platform as a whole suffering from these sucky upgrade policies.</p>
<p>The solution is simple. Refuse to buy a phone on an older OS</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t purchase any phone on ICS. Make the manufactures do better. The Optimus G and RAZRs  are prime examples of inexcusable releases on ICS. One company is owned by Google and the other appears to have the same exact phone running the latest version of Jelly Bean in the supposed next Nexus.</p>
<p>At least Sony is announcing the plans for their upgrade roadmap.</p>
<p>You know whats funny. That people keep buying Andoird phones and expecting these updates. The Rezound is my last Android phone.</p>
<p>Except people aren&#8217;t expecting updates. Not the average customer (who makes up the majority of sales). The only people that care about updates are the people who visit tech sites like this. If people cared that much, and were annoyed by no updates, they wouldn&#8217;t keep buying Android phones.</p>
<p>That really depends.  If you buy a Nexus device you get upgrades for years, it&#8217;s the manufacturer skins that they both insist on having and then refuse to update that are the problem.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t seem surprising at all.</p>
<p>Outrage!  <br />
Loud Noises!<br />
Self Righteousness!</p>
<p>Go Nexi.. All the way..!!</p>
<p>WTH! :-(<br />
Sony Ericsson&#8217;s ICS update was buggy as hell and we won&#8217;t receive Jelly bean :-( <br />
Nice way to screw your customers..</p>
<p>Does it really matter?</p>
<p>If my parents are any indication of the mainstream user (they certainly are more than I am) then mainstream users really won&#8217;t care about this the way that we Verge readers do. My Dad got a Gnex because I got one and he doesn&#8217;t care that it&#8217;s a Nexus &#8211; he only cares that reception isn&#8217;t so hot in my hometown and that his voice control couldn&#8217;t call his contacts by name due to the way he synced them. Against my urging, my Mom got a Droid RAZR because &#8220;the iPhone screen is too small&#8221; and my Dad convinced her that the Nexus was a bad option. I don&#8217;t think she has any idea of the advantage of her 4.0 upgrade, and she doesn&#8217;t really care. If these are similar stories top the majority of people, then it makes sense for companies to focus their efforts in pleasing them. Since most of us Verge readers will get a nexus or a high-end phone anyway, OEMs really need only to keep those sort of up to date, or even just make unlocking the bootloader fairly simple, to cater to us.</p>
<p>Not upgrading an Android phone to a newer OS version is the same as not upgrading a Win XP computer to SP1 or 2 or 3. Or any of the other thousands of smaller updates.</p>
<p>In the end, an old version is susceptible to security problems and has software bugs that may have be fixed. It&#8217;s not about having the flashiest new features.</p>
<p>Again, though, the point stands. Until there is a widely publicized example of a recent phone with a huge and dangerous security flaw, the OEMs clearly feel that it isn&#8217;t worth their investment to do the upgrade &#8211; even if the educated minority knows better.</p>
<p>These guys need to sort their shit out.</p>
<p>Laptop makers are even worse. Three years since I bought it, and my laptop is still on the same OS number.</p>
<p>If there was a competitor laptop manufacturer who upgraded your laptop every year instantly, free of charge, I think you&#8217;d mind it a little more.</p>
<p>:-)</p>
<p>I do get upgrades free of charge, but they don&#8217;t add value for me. A mature OS does not need to be changed every year.</p>
<p>Never buy an other Android phone than the Nexus!</p>
<p>And my XPERIA U still hasn&#8217;t received ICS.</p>
<p>Mine too. Or rather my old one which is currently on Ebay&#8230; I don;t get this product code malarky&#8230;</p>
<p>My gsm Gnex runs 4.1.2 and since it randomly reboots after calls. Already tvice today&#8230;. But still no other android phone for me that nexus.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>I will never buy a Sony Mobile phone  again !!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Well at least they&#8217;re pretty clear and update a lot of devices.</p>
<p>I hope they just forgot to include Xperia SL. It&#8217;s just Xperia S with a speed bump.</p>
<p>Its not even a question anymore that if you want an Android phone you are better off with a Nexus phone.</p>
<p>By the way, does Galaxy S2 support Jelly Bean?</p>
<p>Yes, Samsung confirmed that it will.</p>
<blockquote>Yes, Samsung confirmed that it <strong>will</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>So the correct answer right now, is &#8216;no&#8217;.</p>
<p>I was running Jelly Bean on mine since July&#8230;</p>
<p>Great, just in time for the next version to be out and complete the waiting cycle.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s rather disappointing.</p>
<p>Anyway, owners of non-carrier Sony phones: <a href="http://unlockbootloader.sonymobile.com/">Start here</a> and then <a href="http://code.google.com/p/freexperia/">go here</a>.</p>
<p>Got to love Android&#8230;.</p>
<p>I think the critical thing here is reading into this from the actual sony mobile blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our latest models, Xperia T and Xperia TX are shipping across global markets as you read this post, and Xperia V is on the way shortly – these smartphones will begin to receive the upgrade to Jelly Bean from mid-Q1 2013.</p>
<p>Next up, we can confirm the global versions of Xperia S, Xperia acro S, Xperia ion, Xperia P, Xperia go and Xperia J will be upgraded to Android 4.1* – we will be back with detailed timings for these in due course.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>This is suggestive that the update for earlier 2012 phones will be before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Also U and Sola not being on the list is suggestive of Sony trying to make full use of JB on these more unique devices (floating touch and multicoloured light up strip).</p>
<p>This is one of several reasons why I&#8217;m buying an IPhone. I appreciate the fact that Android has a variety of phones to choose from but rolling out updates at a snails pace is ridiculous! I have a Bionic that is still on 2.3.4 with no signs of an update in sight.</p>
<p>The Droid Bionic is getting ICS today =)</p>
<p>And I thought Sony was supposed to be really good about updating their phones to the latest version of Android.</p>
<p>The current models will get Jelly Bean in Q1 next year?  That&#8217;s 1/2-3/4 of a year after the launch of JB, great job.</p>
<p>Some of the phones being excluded are just barely half a year old.  This is ridiculous, why is this being tolerated?</p>
<p>Damn you Sony. Laggy Android is suck too because the platform gives no upgrade certainty. This Xperia Neo V will be my only Android phone. Next phone will be either Windows Phone or iPhone.</p>
<p>Sucks for Xperia owners. I&#8217;m actually surprised by this. Sony has been doing so well with ICS updates, then they just screw up that good rep they were getting by giving some BS excuse. My Nexus S is a lot less powerful than some of the phones Sony&#8217;s not upgrading, yet it runs Jelly Bean 4.1.2 without any problem. Performance actually got better with JB thanks to things like Project Butter.</p>
<p>And people say Samsung puts out too many Android phones&#8230;</p>
<p>:( I was really hoping that the Xperia U get JB</p>
<p>Bottom line is if you buy an android just don&#8217;t expect to be updated ever.  So if you happen to get an update it&#8217;s a nice surprise.</p>
<p>Well, you can expect an update if you buy a Nexus device. (which runs on Android btw, in case if you don&#8217;t know)</p>
<p>If you buy a GSM unlocked version direct from Google.</p>
<p>Even then the GS II beat the Nexus S to ICS. The GS III isn&#8217;t far behind the Galaxy Nexus. If Jelly Bean had been debuted on a different device the GS III would have probably beat the Galaxy Nexus to an update.</p>
<p>The Nexus program guarantees you <em>nothing</em>.</p>
<p>OEMs are having a hard time getting uses to a model where phones require additional development after they ship. Samsung is getting this faster and better than anyone else. Motorola, LG, and Sony are having a hard time figuring it out. HTC is somewhere in the middle. Speak with your wallet and don&#8217;t support companies that don&#8217;t support their products.</p>
<p>and THIS is the problem with Android. These idiots dont want to update there phones that ARE capable of the newest OS.</p>
<p>I can guarantee Sony will release more hardware devices before they even update there current available roster, and I dont mean one phone, I mean MULTIPLE phones. Lame. Google needs to fix there updating guidelines for ALL manufacturers.  This is that horrible ecosystem that Android has, and Google sits back and does nothing about.</p>
<p>When Google releases a new update, these companys should be ontop of it and ready to release for capable hardwre within weeks if not a month.  The thing is they CAN do it, they just choose NOT too and its a fucked up ecosystem.</p>
<p>The U and the Sola will probably get Jelly Bean, it&#8217;s just not confirmed yet. Since they are almost exactly the same as the Go in hardware it shouldn&#8217;t be an issue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a shame for the 2011 models, but you have to remember that those already received several major updates. First within Gingerbread (with a lot of added functionality) and then they got the update to ICS. Sony still is the only manufacturer that has all it&#8217;s phones released in 2011 and 2012 on Ice Cream Sandwich.</p>
<p>This is BS by Sony! Part of Google&#8217;s strategy when they announced JB was PB &#8211; Project Butter. This was optimised code to make JB run smoother on your device. Considering that without JB, mid to high end devices run pretty well anyway on ICS, PB was developed for low to mid range / older mid to high end devices, IE, those you dear consumer spent your hard earned doolars on. And so Sony and others should stop forcing you to buy the latest hardware, and instead show project some integrity and work with Google to add JB to their 2011 devices pronto, else, AHWBL!</p>
<p>(All Hell Will Break Loose.)</p>
<p>I thought Project Butter was just doubled framerate for better perceived smoothness.</p>
<p>Well, at least Sony is honest, unlike that other company that starts with M and ends with ola, that promised an update and then said &#8220;oops, nevermind,&#8221; I&#8217;m actually surprised that my Arc even got ICS, although to be honest, it could gain something from project butter. ICS is not the smoothest on it.<br />
I think the big problem is, most of 2011 Sony phones have extremely limited internal storage (remember HTC? Nexus One? Same thing). Example, the Arc only has like 300MB something internal storage. Simply install a few apps and Google&#8217;s own updates on their own apps, hardly anything left.<br />
Oh well.</p>
<p>this is why sony is failing&#8230;</p>
<p>Im here in Japan, and I have a Sony Acro HD. Not sure what it&#8217;s called globally, but I have yet to see an update to 4.0. It&#8217;s hardly a deal breaker for me; phone is fantastic. But I would like to upgrade. Does anyone know if it&#8217;s available, and how I can upgrade? Basically, help!</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m thinking- already, Sony&#8217;s non-1GB RAM phones (essentially all 2011 phones and new non-HD phones, save the Xperia P)  are close to choking with Ice Cream Sandwich- I &#8216;ve had a considerable amount of hands-on time with my friend&#8217;s Neo V running Sony&#8217;s official 4.0.4 and everything&#8217;s choppy, to say the least. The only place where it was fast was with the camera capture.</p>
<p>Apparently, it seems that having 512MB RAM to operate the Android OS <em>on top of Sony&#8217;s UI</em> is already working the phones overtime. What more when Jellybean arrives?</p>
<p>I own an Xperia Arc and I though of getting an Xperia T but now I guess I will not buy it but would rather get iPhone5! By the time Xperia T gets JB another version of Andriod will come and my phone once again will become obsolete! Apple provided iOS6 for even iPhone 3GS! Say what you want but the update cycle of Andriod sucks!</p>
<p>And in a country where you need to pay for the phone without any subsidiaries from the mobile operator, spending $800 on a phone every year is just too expensive!</p>
<p>What about XPERIA NEO L?</p>
<p>Sell your old phone on Ebay. Lot better deal. Google has terrible customer service and it strikes again =0(</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with Google and everything to do with Motorola. Not sure what you&#8217;re talking about..</p>
<p>If Google wants Motorola to turn a profit they need to do a lot better than this. Saying &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry&#8221; won&#8217;t do any good.</p>
<p>I am afraid we will be welcoming more people to this petition.</p>
<p>This is bad for all moto users.</p>
<p>About time someone fought back.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/motorola-mobility-update-my-phone" target="new">http://www.change.org/petitions/motorola-mobility-update-my-phone</a></p>
<p>Yeah, good luck with that. Online petitions are so successful, after all.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t?</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m9k10xhArJ1r1n5eb.jpg" /></p>
<p>yeah.. if only Motorola&#8217;s parent company could step in and clear this mess up.. oh wait..</p>
<p>Just like Gamercore said, Motorola =/= Google. There two different entities and if you have ever had a nexus, you would know Google would never do this to a phone unless its over 3 to 4 years old.</p>
<p>Do you remember trying to get customer service on the Nexus One? What about trying to get JB on the Verizon Gnex? Or try getting a real person to talk to you if you pay for Gmail.</p>
<p>Well, I agree with you there. Google&#8217;s customer service is damn near non-existent.</p>
<p>But in reference to the article, again, this is Motorola&#8217;s customer service. Not Google&#8217;s.</p>
<blockquote>Google’s customer service is damn near non-existent.</blockquote>
<p>They have some semblance of support for their actual customers, their advertisers. But even then the help extends only to advertising.</p>
<p>I recently had a problem on my MCC account where I couldn&#8217;t create new clients and Google got back to me within a few days &#8211; which is pretty darn impressive for them. However, when I told the rep that my Google voice account has been bugged for months, he offered little more than his condolences.</p>
<p>i didn&#8217;t have to try hard to get JB onto my Verizon GNex. it&#8217;s a nexus.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t have to try at all.</p>
<p>two sides, same coin.</p>
<p>the nexus devices are interesting that way.</p>
<p>Got good customer service from Google apps for business this year&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>There two different entities and if you have ever had a nexus, you would know Google would never do this to a phone unless its over 3 to 4 years old.</blockquote>

<p>Why are they considered separate? If Skype screws up, do you honestly think no one here is going to bring up Microsoft?</p>
<p>Has Microsoft promised to run Skype at an arm&#8217;s length and not interfere with its operations at all? If yes, then it would be wrong to blame Microsoft, but if not&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yes, surely Google will never interfere with anything Motorola does.</p>

<p>The Nexus One wasn&#8217;t even supported for 2 full years, and I doubt the Nexus S will be capable of running 5.0 at anything resembling a respectable rate.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just sell it, Gazelle it!</p>
<p>No Retina display.</p>
<p>Do you need to turn your old phone in to receive $100. I thought they just give you 100 dollars discount.</p>
<p>Do you get $100 and keep your old phone?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why anyone would buy a Motorola phone at this point. I&#8217;d just stick to a Nexus, One X or Samsung phone at this point.</p>
<p>but they have like all the batteries</p>
<p>LOL, I could understand that if you&#8217;re buying the MAXX and you needed battery life to make it through the apocalypse but their phones are inferior in almost every other way to other Android phones.</p>
<p>Not really. It depends on what&#8217;s important to the individual. As you pointed out, battery life might trump screen quality.</p>
<p>Also, Motorola hands down has the best radios. So during your apocalypse scenario I might rather have a Motorola device so I can get out that last call. :-)</p>
<p>Motorola does have the best radios which is sort of important in a smartphone.  I think it might have something to do with their history and how they, oh I don&#8217;t know, <em>invented the cell phone</em>.</p>
<p>&#8230;and to others they hardly ever use their phones as a, you know, phone, anymore :)</p>
<p>The battery is only an exception with certain Motorola phones. After that there are other issues at play such as screen quality, processor, updates, skinning and trust.</p>
<blockquote>Also, Motorola hands down has the best radios.  :-)</blockquote>
<p>That was my experience a decade ago when I owned a RAZR. It&#8217;s far less of an issue today and usually the blame lies at the foot of the carrier.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read a review which considered any recent Motorola phone a top 5 Android phone since the original Droid.</p>
<p>Go read engadgets review of the HDs. They say point blank it matches the S3 and can go toe to toe with the one x.</p>
<p>Get the HD now and 1 year from now it&#8217;ll still be running JB with no updates planned then 1.5 years later they&#8217;ll say you can get a $100 credit if you buy another Motorola phone on another 2 year contract.  Doesn&#8217;t sound good enough to me.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t read Engadget anymore. The talent defected to The Verge. I&#8217;ve used both an SIII and the One X (from friends and when upgrading to the iPhone 5.) I can tell you that both are far better than any of Motorola&#8217;s offerings at the Verizon store when I upgraded to the iPhone 5. Not only that but they Samsung and Nexus phones have better resale value.</p>
<p>This is not some slight against Google. I just believe that Motorola has become mediocre at hardware. I think this will change in the next year when Motorola will be the Nexus brand for Google.</p>
<p>Motorola and Nokia have best radios. Nokia also has call quality. Apple, Samsung, and HTC are crap at radios and call quality.</p>
<p>A lot of reviews disagree with you. Which is sort of telling of how much you know.</p>
<p>I was waiting for a comment as dumb as yours to enter this thread. So Motorola is losing money every quarter because every other Android handset is lousy?</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus<br />
One X <br />
GSIII<br />
Optimus G<br />
Galaxy Note/2</p>
<p>Those are the 5 best Android phones. Even The Verge gave the the RAZR M just a 7.0.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the release chronology for the phones you listed and the phones you are comparing them to? And why is HTC leaving market after market? Because they have such awesome sets? Is RAZR M Motorola&#8217;s only set to be released before the end of 2012?</p>
<p>Idiot much?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m comparing phones within the past year. You didn&#8217;t get that? That&#8217;s why I started with the Nexus which I still believe is the best Android phone.</p>
<blockquote>And why is HTC leaving market after market?</blockquote>
<p>Did HTC leave the smartphone market? Are they losing more money than Motorola? HTC actually posts profits. THeir profits have been declining year over year.</p>
<blockquote>Is RAZR M Motorola’s only set to be released before the end of 2012?</blockquote>
<p>I care about today you moron. Otherwise I would be talking about the new Nexus phone coming.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re exactly what&#8217;s wrong with the web. You can&#8217;t offer criticism without being offensive. You deserve every bit of hate I&#8217;m willing to give on a Friday night because there needs to be less of you people on The Verge.</p>
<p>Galaxy nexus best smartphone? Wow the crappy camera and pen tile screen  pushes close to the worst smartphone. Just because it runs stock doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s the best.<br />
Hopefully the lg Optimus g nexus is up to mark in all categories.</p>
<p>motorola has crazy good hardware and feels great when you hold it.</p>
<p>that is why so many people bought their phones.</p>
<p>again they have been dropping the ball left and right and taking a big shit on their customers.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;d release an HD Maxx on AT&amp;T w/unlocked bootloader I&#8217;d buy w/o hesitation.</p>
<p>The Note 2 battery is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.</p>
<p>Ya the battery on there sounds super promising. That has me pretty excited actually. If WP 8 doesn&#8217;t go so hot (especially on verizon) I think the note 2 will be my phone.</p>
<p>Considering Verizon is only planning to get pretty much the worst WP8 phone announced so far you&#8217;re definitely getting a Note 2.  I&#8217;ve got a Droid 3 and was interested in the Nokia 920 but now I know I&quot;m getting the Note 2 once I&#8217;m eligible for upgrade in December.</p>
<p>i guess it depends what you are considering the worst&#8230;. If you are assuming the 8x and 8s won&#8217;t be going to verizon and are talking about the weird 822 or whatever than yes I won&#8217;t pick that up. Otherwise I think the 8x looks promising. I guess it also depends if 4.2 gets announced and the note 2 just doesn&#8217;t get it until forever. At the same time I still like iOS and since I mostly use my mac and iPad it helps that it plays nice with my phone. It&#8217;s funny though, I&#8217;m excited to see the note 2 hit verizon (really hope they don&#8217;t change anything for the worst) but honestly I couldn&#8217;t be less interested in any of the possible nexus phones.</p>
<p>Battery.</p>
<p>The RAZR M is almost as narrow as the iPhone. It&#8217;s significantly thinner than the Sony Xperia V. Yet it has a bigger battery than both and also the HTC One S. Unlike the One S the storage can be expanded which is great for holding videos and a music collection. The biggest shame about the RAZR M is it doesn&#8217;t have a 720p screen like the Sony. The second biggest shame is it won&#8217;t work on my carrier.</p>
<p>the only way to deal with this company is to fight back.</p>
<p>if considerable number of users file a lawsuit then they will have to do something.</p>
<p>help us fight back..</p>

<p>Them moto phones are indestructible</p>
<p>A Google owned company can&#8217;t push updates to 1 or 2 year old phones?</p>
<p>How pathetic.</p>
<p>Even iPhone 3GS and Nexus S still get updated.</p>
<p>Shut up! Google has owned the company for 3 months. They can&#8217;t update all the different flavors of crap moto made before them. Like many have said this is still pre Google moto give them time.</p>
<p>This for sure.</p>
<p>The Google era of Motorola hasn&#8217;t even begun yet. At some point they&#8217;ll realize the huge opportunity they have in owning Motorola and deliver unto us an in-house Motorola-Nexus brand.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope not. I even prefer LG over Motorola.</p>
<p>When you thought Motorola screens couldn&#8217;t get any worse they literally invented PenTile LCDs! <br />
Holding a friends XOOM made me burst out in laughter. The viewing angles! The weight! <br />
Outside of the US, were they don&#8217;t have Verizon to promote their garbage, Motorola is dead and gone. Good Riddance.</p>
<blockquote>Holding a friends XOOM made me burst out in laughter. The viewing angles! The weight! </blockquote>
<p>Welp, in all fairness, the XOOM has pretty much been ordained a Nexus tablet. 4.1.2 is rolling out first to only three devices: The Galaxy Nexus, Nexus S, and the XOOM.</p>
<p>The US Xoom that is. Non US Zooms are on ICS.</p>
<p>Uhm no, no they didn&#8217;t. Samsung did, actually.</p>
<p>Time for what? These customers are never going to see an update.</p>
<p>These failings are hurting Motorola in the FUTURE. So Google can act as if they had nothing to with this, but regular customers will not make that distinction you made.</p>
<p>Agreed. I love Google and am totally an Android fan, but I will never buy another Motorola phone. After the X2, I am beyond fed up with Moto and their shocking disrespect for their own customers. It will literally take years of nearly perfection for me to even consider Moto a viable option.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not wasting resources on phones that are moto-blurred.</p>
<p>Translation: They’re not wasting resources on customer service.</p>
<p>Well, good for them.</p>
<p>The big question is how does this affect people still under contract.  My wife is under contract with an X2 and can&#8217;t upgrade until May, is she going to get $100 if she does it at that point?</p>
<p>Not that I care that much, as I won&#8217;t be letting her really &#8220;pick&#8221; her phone and will be steering her to one that won&#8217;t be abandoned like this (i.e.. a Nexus device or an iPhone), but might be good info for some out there.</p>
<blockquote>**Provided in the form of a Verizon Wireless Gift Card, Motorola Visa Prepaid Card, carrier credit, or other equivalent at Motorola’s sole discretion.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like it doesn&#8217;t just apply to purchasing new phones, but that it is potentially just $100 credit.</p>
<p>The X2 was an okay phone for it&#8217;s time. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s more than functional for her until May. Would you rather get the an update in Feb-Mar and not get the $100 when you will be getting a new phone in May either way. Doesn&#8217;t sound like she&#8217;s the one all worried about it.</p>
<p>So they&#8217;ll be receiving Jelly Bean after Key Lime Pie gets announced&#8230; Nice #fragmentationatitsbest</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t blame Google. This is clearly old Motorola who put out too many trash irrelevant phones that carriers wanted not consumers. Hopefully they do streamline their product portfolio to just few marquee phones(just 3) hi end, mid, low end. As well sell them to each carrier with the same identity no stupid silly name like photon, atrix and please DROID get rid of the name DROID. 2013 will be the year of Googarola</p>
<p>It was the Droid branding that launched Android&#8217;s success. They&#8217;re not going to ditch that one. Besides, they probably paid a crap ton of licensing fees to Lucas for the use of the Droid name (he holds the trademark). They&#8217;ll milk it for all it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>Also, Motorola Photon = MoPho = best damn phone nickname ever.</p>
<p>Yes, your right the DROID marketing did catapult Android success, but since this is a Goggle company. I highly doubt they "DROID&quot; name since people can identify what Android is and what it can do.</p>
<p>Wow, the Atrix 2 has only been one yea old since last week. This kind of support is beyond <em>pathetic</em>!</p>
<p>STAY AWAY from Motorola1</p>
<p>And they were lucky to get a year-old operating system upgrade. Awesome.</p>
<p>I understand these are pre-Google Motorola devices, but still. It&#8217;s ridiculous that these devices are not getting upgraded to the latest version of Android. I&#8217;m sure the carriers are partly to blame, but some of it still has to fall on the manufacturers. My old ass Nexus S runs Jelly Bean without a problem. Performance has even gotten better because of it. It&#8217;s nice that Moto is doing this, but still.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not angry by any means (have a Nexus), but all I have left to say is fuck the carriers, and fuck the OEMs. They&#8217;re all lazy and stupid.</p>
<p>Original Motorola Xoom FTW.</p>
<p>AOSP supported device (i.e. stock).  Gets all of the updates.  Ticks the box on every feature (besides NFC).  It&#8217;s still the best large-screen Android tablet all things considered.  And it will likely stay that way until the Nexus 10 is released.</p>
<p>Already sold my Atrix 4G on eBay for $175. A $100 voucher is insulting. Bought Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. I&#8217;m never buying Motorola products again!</p>
<p>Holy crap, so not only are customers getting royally screwed by not getting an update on a phone that is more than likely less than a year old, the $100 requires you to send in your old phone!?!!</p>
<p>Wow, I at least thought it was an instant credit when purchasing a new one! So not only are you getting screwed for the update but they want to screw you even more by only giving you $100 for your old phone, wow.</p>
<p> I would saw you will be WAY better off selling it on Craigslist or eBay, but considering this ordeal, your old phone might not even be worth more than that now.</p>
<p>Pretty crappy for those that had one of those phones. One of the reasons to stay away from Android was due to the mess that is updates, this just affirms that position.</p>
<p>If I was going to go for their credit I&#8217;d bash my phone into a million pieces before sending it in.  Why would I let them sell it and make that $100 back?  Basterds.  Hey, Samsung, hurry up with the Note2 so I can give you my money!</p>
<p>What a debacle, honestly, what&#8217;s so hard about getting updates out there?</p>
<p>If they&#8217;d simply stick with straight Android, pure Android without BS &#8220;skins&#8221;, updates would be rolled out just like with the iPhone, right?</p>
<p>Not really, I believe a large amount of time is spent getting all of the various device drivers to work with the new OS.  Even if it was stock Android, it would probably still take a few months to get it pushed over.</p>
<p>Honestly, Motorla could have kept their $100 and no one really would have cared or suspected anything. It&#8217;s not really a surprise.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight: Motorola&#8217;s saying &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, we screwed up/can&#8217;t afford devs to update your still hardware relevant and capable phone to the latest version of android.  We realize because it&#8217;s only a year (or less) old, you&#8217;ll probably never want another motorola phone.  As a result, we&#8217;ll give you a $100 discount to buy another one of our phones (which is another game of roulette as far as updates go), because we assume you&#8217;re a glutton for punishment&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re forgetting the part where you&#8217;re not really getting a credit, but selling your phone back to them for $100. You don&#8217;t get both.</p>
<p>not only are you giving your old phone back to them, you&#8217;re also locking yourself in to buy another crappy motorola phone, original price before the $100 rebate being in the $600 range.  so really they&#8217;re just tricking you to buy more of their crappy products for a little discount.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be cool if they just release the source and bootloader unlocks and let XDA take care of upgrades</p>
<p>No kidding.  The XDA developers can get a ROM for these phones and on their spare time without the necessary drivers and a locked bootloader.  How the hell can they not do it?  It just makes no sense.</p>
<p>Excellent comment.  If Motorola is going to stiff all of these customers, the least they can do is unlock the bootloaders for the ones that DO care about that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>I was already burned on the Atrix 4G and Droid 3 and today I learned that Motorola fooled me once again with the Atrix 2. And the rebate program is a joke! I have three eligible phones yet the offer is only valid in USA.</p>
<p>So&#8230;an observation if I may.  What kind of moron does Motorola think makes up their customer base?</p>
<p>Motorola offers $100 towards (for many) what is an off contract device, that is their olive branch.  Considering that those same devices (the ones being traded in) still sell at $350-$450 from Motorola themselves, what kind of &#8220;apology&#8221; is that exactly?</p>
<p>You should feel bad Motorola, and your quarterly results will provide the empirical data to support that suggestion.</p>
<p>I love how everyone keeps bashing Motorola when it is now 100% Google. Get over your cognitive dissonance, and any time you get the urge to type Motorola, type Google.</p>
<p>Notice how Google&#8217;s stock crashed after their last quarterly results? Wall St. knows Motorola == Google &#8212; why don&#8217;t Verge commenters?</p>
<p>Just another company to add to my DON&#8217;T BUY list.</p>

<p>Being an owner of a Droid X2 has been an absolute nightmare. I purchased the X2 (around June of last year) because it was time for an upgrade and it was right before Verizon was rumored to eliminate their unlimited data plans. Based on reviews and the hardware, it seemed like a great purchase with a pretty good future(dual core, fairly high-res screen, decent camera, reasonable amount of RAM)&#8230;.then it took nearly 3 months to get an update to gingerbread (which its predecessor already had at the X2&#8217;s launch).</p>
<p>And from there, we X2 owners got stepped on from every angle. Incremental updates with a locked boot loader right along with ever degrading performance. Unfortunately, the critics who only reviewed the phone after a week never realized that &#8220;MotoBlur&#8221; would eventually cripple a perfectly fine piece of hardware. Eventually, bugs, crashes, and battery pulls were an everyday reality for any long-term X2 owners.</p>
<p>My personal temporary escape from hell was rooting/pseudo-flashing. I&#8217;m running the only &#8220;stable&#8221; cyanogenmod ROM  (7), and even that is a hack and is still in beta. Anything beyond Gingerbread is in completely unsupported territory and will forever be mostly unstable.</p>
<p>Just think about what Moto is saying to its customers. They are not only admitting they screwed up, but that they screwed up so badly they are willing to pay for at least half the price of your next phone. But, just to rub some salt into that wound, they make sure it&#8217;s another Motorola — AND you have to send in the original torture machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey baby, we&#8217;re sorry we hurt you, it&#8217;s just that we love you so much. Give us another chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Try the M versions of cyano, they are pretty usable as main driver.</p>
<p>So is the Razr Maxx getting JB? (GSM Version)</p>
<p>Price of fragmentation.</p>
<p>This is an interesting move. I wonder what motivated this. Other manufacturers have just not bothered to update their phones, and aside from people ranting in tech news site comments <strong>cough</strong>, uh, nothing happened. There must be some advantage to this move either monetarily or as a PR thing, but I don&#8217;t really understand why they&#8217;re doing it.</p>
<p>I hope that due to the fact that the changes from ICS to Jelly Bean are minor, fully featured custom roms will show up more quickly.</p>
<p>Indeed, donate to your devs!</p>
<blockquote> fully featured custom roms</blockquote>
<p>are per device. They will come at the same speed as they always have. People are also super eager, so as ever, the nice guys from XDA will give you jelly bean, (minus GPS, accelerometer, and FFC or w/e)</p>
<blockquote>They will come at the same speed as they always have</blockquote>
<p>ICS was a very significant transition and took much longer for CM9 to get up to speed. The changes between ICS and JB are not quite as drastic and should reduce their ROM development time. <br />
The JB ROM for my LTE GNex has all hardware working already. The code hasn&#8217;t been released yet officially.</p>
<p>This is what I assumed might be the case.  It took a while to get ICS running properly on devices like my Bionic because the kernel was built for Gingerbread.  Hopefully, a lot of the functions such as LTE and cameras will work on Jelly Bean using the ICS kernel (that was just leaked for Bionic, and is arriving for some other devices as well).</p>
<p>Exactly. People are overstating the relative difficulty of a full point upgrade and a .x upgrade.</p>
<p>idk, project butter does not sound all that small to me. It sounds super awesome tho. It&#8217;s like an attack on my main problem with android in general.</p>
<p>But all the butter stuff is API compatible, and also compatible with ICS kernels AFAIK. It&#8217;s just new plumbing in between the two, which makes it easier.</p>
<p>But versioning doesn&#8217;t work that way. .x upgrades are inherently a subset of x.0 updates, meaning that the changes are relatively smaller.</p>
<p>interpretation and importance of features and how they are subjective was more my point, but i agree, they want this to be considered a smaller update, hence the 4.0-4.1 naming.</p>
<p>Releasing a 5.0 before you hit 10% adoption of 4.0 would look really bad so I am sure that played into the &#8220;4.1&#8221; version number partly.  But I actually do believe that this is a much smaller upgrade to Android than ICS was.  Let&#8217;s face it, 3.0 Honeycomb was never open-sourced because Google made some big changes to support tablets and the code was likely not in the kind of shape that you would want folks to build on top of it.  ICS was a cleanup of all that code and some big changes to the SDK and (in my opinion) finally brought to Android to maturity.  Ironically, iOS 5.0 (which was released about the same time) is what finally brought iOS to maturity on many features as well.  It seems Android played catch up on the user experience and SDK improvements to reduce fragmentation in the future and that Apple played catch-up on the feature set with things like notification center and voice recognition.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, I think the parity continues with Apple refining iOS further in version 6 with turn-by-turn navigation and better voice control in this release and Google updating voice control and UI smoothness in 4.1.  It will be interesting to see if either Google or Apple can add a truly distinctive break-out feature in the next 12 months or if we are just going into a state of refinement and incremental improvement for mobile operating systems.</p>
<p>In the past, Apple has made a habit of changing the game as soon as competitors &#8220;caught up&#8221; to them on the things they excelled at.  The only positive differentiator that iOS has now over Android (other than somebody&#8217;s personal UX/UI preference) is the third-party app and hardware ecosystem.  It seems to me that the next 24 months will be indicative of whether Apple without Jobs can still &#8220;change the game&#8221;.  Either Apple will double-down on third-party integration with things like automotive integration and television integration or they will tell third parties that they have something even better to start building around.</p>
<p>Android 4.1 looks great &#8212; I&#8217;m sure lots of folks will be clamoring for upgrades.  All those who bought the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus S should be cheering right now &#8212; Nexus devices really make the most sense if you want timely upgrades.  Here&#8217;s hoping that the hardware vendors can get other devices upgraded in less than 6 months time given the ICS foundation of Jelly Bean.</p>
<blockquote>It seems Android played catch up on the user experience and SDK improvements to reduce fragmentation in the future and that Apple played catch-up on the feature set with things like notification center and voice recognition.</blockquote>
<p>incredibly well put.</p>
<p>And while the 3rd party eco system is still an advantage (much more so in the tablet arena than the phone one) Apple needs to push harder if they wish to maintain that edge in terms of API&#8217;s, and frameworks.</p>
<p>great post tho.</p>
<p>How about google reduce fragmentation in the present.  I don&#8217;t care about the future, I care about my abandoned phone now.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Google can ever control the Android world like Apple over iOS, they don&#8217;t make them, and they don&#8217;t subsidize they. OEMs don&#8217;t care what Google says unless they can make money by following Google. Most consumers are buying device &#8220;with touch screen and good camera&#8221;, they&#8217;d like to have SNS apps and games, but that&#8217;s all average users expect. They don&#8217;t understand the value of updates like geeks here, and thus rolling out latest Android does not help OEMs compete much, sadly.</p>
<p>The only way to stay relatively current is to buy a Nexus phone. You get a &#8220;pure&#8221; Android experience, and pretty much guaranteed OS updates as long as the hardware supports the new features.</p>
<p>Are there any compelling additions to Android that the other manufacturers add to the stock OS? I can&#8217;t think of any&#8230;</p>
<p>No, I really hope they don&#8217;t &#8220;double down&#8221; on anything. That would spell doom.</p>
<p>I agree.  I think they need a breakthrough new product or feature in the next 24 months &#8212; something that creates a halo effect for their existing stuff.  Doubling down on third-party integration and ecosystem would likely spell doom because it puts your advantage in the hands of third parties who can then give that advantage to your competitor.  It also smells of protecting your turf and stagnation which is what Microsoft was doing for too long before they started work on Windows Phone and Windows 8 and it is what RIM tried to do with enterprise lock-in &#8212; the enterprises are now moving to iOS because their users have.</p>
<p>Once something gets old you need to canibalize it yourself and move on.  I&#8217;m not saying that iOS is getting old, but I am saying that if there are only incremental improvements on the mobile OS front for all players then mobile operating systems become commodities.  If that occurs, Apple needs to create something new to revolutionize some other sector and that new thing needs to integrate so well with iOS (and OS X) that it gives iOS an intangible advantage over other mobile operating systems.  Apple cannot rely on third parties to own that.</p>
<p>Here is a great post that is along the same lines:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/06/28/someone_is_coming_to_eat_you.html" target="_blank">http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/06/28/someone_is_coming_to_eat_you.html</a></p>
<p>BC2009 you really have explained it all very well.</p>
<p>Talking about stand out feature&#8230; only 2 weeks ago was I thinking that my phones knows so much about me.. why doesn&#8217;t it let me know that when im about to go to the gym that there is been a crash and it will take me 40mins not the usual 20mins.</p>
<p>Then along comes google now&#8230; the potential to be that stand out feature.. but as google like to do, released early and still in its infancy. So google now won&#8217;t be seens as a amazing tool simple because its not there year and it may be in a years time&#8230;</p>
<p>Where as if apple released it. It would be that amazing feature that really stands out.. but we wouldn&#8217;t have had it for another 12months&#8230; Its tough because apple wow you with what they have hidden over time, google show you what they are doing as they do it (e.g Google Glass)</p>
<p>Neither is the better or worse way. Its just interesting to see how they handle things differently and easy to see why people can get very excited for apple updates while at same time slate them for bring out &#8220;new features&#8221; (e.g. copy and paste)</p>
<p>Very good points.  The only feature I have seen from Apple that was released &#8220;early&#8221; was Siri, and that was because Siri would only get better if they had a larger sampling of input data to work with.  However, by the time Siri starts getting really good (with iOS 6 improvements), along comes Google&#8217;s new voice features and suddenly we have parity again.</p>
<p>Google Now is brilliant, but it will likely be deficient at first.  In a year when it gets really good, then Apple will likely have some equivalent (probably based around Passbook).  And again we get parity.</p>
<p>Your remark about Apple keeping it under covers is spot on.  Look at how they have been collecting traffic data anonymously (its even in their EULA for iOS that they will do this).  Now all of a sudden we see turn-by-turn GPS from Apple with live traffic from established sources and crowd-sourcing.  Google has had turn-by-turn for several iterations in Android, but iOS users have had to pay for their turn-by-turn navigation.  I have used Navigon and have loved it.  But now, Apple brings it to the core operating system in iOS 6 at the same time that both Apple and Google unveil realistic 3D mapping using fly-over captures from airplanes.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Apple and Google are basically trading blows right now.  Its good for consumers since each is driving the other, but the next game changer is going to have to be something that is &#8220;5 years ahead of the competition&#8221; in order to prevent the competitors from copying it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that patents usually take about 3 to 5 years from application to issuance.  So even if one of these players came out with some awesome software feature, the other could easily copy it until the originator got its patent issued and by then it might not matter as much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m watching Apple very closely in the next 24 months.  I&#8217;m very interested to see if they have anything cool up their sleeves.  Google has revealed their next great thing: Google Glass.  But at $1500 a pair to preorder the preview version due out in 2014, it is a bit out of most people&#8217;s league.  Apple does not tip their hand that way, so it will be interesting to see what they are cooking up.</p>
<p>Honeycomb code was released the same day they released the ICS code. Sorry I know it&#8217;s just nitpicking.</p>
<p>Yup &#8212; true enough.  May be a nitpick, but it is certainly a relevant and good point to make.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be fair though, Apple may release updates to their hardware and make them available to download on a specific day, but the do pick and choose the features that will be available on each of their devices. Obviously, they make that determination by which devices can effectively support a feature, but they also look to marketing too. If the iPhone 4 could have used Siri, then there would not have been much of a reason for upgrade to the 4S.</p>
<p>So Apple&#8217;s devices all read the same version number, but each devices has different features. When the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 comes out, not every phone is going to get turn by turn directions, a feature that has been included on all Android phones for years now. Effectively, some phones will be running iOS 6 with only very minor changes, some phones will only get security updates with iOS 6.</p>
<p>In essence, there is little difference between Apple and Android when it comes to versions. Sure, Android phones may read different version numbers, but in the same way that Apple picks and chooses the features that can be loaded onto their different phones, Android phone manufacturers pick and choose which phones can be updated, and when they can be updated. This allows them to give their new phones a market advantage over their old phones, and new customers will likely be drawn to the updated operating system.</p>
<p>Older phones which cannot handle the features present in newer OS versions will not get updates at all. This may frustrate  some users, especially when they think their phone is still fairly new, but with the way mobile technology advances these days, it doesn&#8217;t take long for a phone to become obsolete.</p>
<p>The same is true even in Apple&#8217;s world. After a year, their phones are obsolete, and not granted the same functionality as their new phones. Now, while Apple only releases a single phone each year (and in one case it took 14 months), Android phones are constantly developed. That leads to greater innovation as each manufacturer competes with another, but the cost is slower update times.</p>
<p>Still, if you bought a phone and you are happy with it, then just be happy with it. It doesn&#8217;t matter the manufacturer or the version, simply enjoy your purchase. Updates for your phone are not a necessity, but rather an added gift of functionality. But if you&#8217;re unhappy with your phone, then maybe there&#8217;s another underlying problem. One that probably won&#8217;t be fixed with new features and a shinier UI.</p>
<p>One key difference.  Some newer apps require the new OS.  Even though some Apple hardware gets very little upgrades from a feature perspective, they get access to the new API&#8217;s that allow users to use newer software that requires them.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s kind of silly to write an application that can be used by a very small percentage of people, is it not? That&#8217;s why Android applications are written for the most popular version, and still work for any higher version.</p>
<p>chrome, and lots of apps which require a ton of DRM (like time warner cable for example, require ICS.</p>
<p>But the other 99.9999% of applications work perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Oh, and boo hoo, you can&#8217;t download Chrome and have to stick with the browser that&#8217;s already on the phone.</p>
<p>being able to watch cable tv on my iPhone and not on my Android is quite annoying.</p>
<p>Do you use IE/Safari on your desktop?</p>
<p>Bullshit. Apple is still very much the innovation leader. At least with the stuff that matters. Companies continue to shamelessly rip off Apple. Microsoft surface and the so called  ultra books come to mind.</p>
<p>Google is ripping off Siri and AirPlay in this release. AirPlay is awesome and Siri&#8230; singlehandedly selling a lot of iPhones.</p>
<p>Voice recognition has been there for a while in the form of an app. Turn by turn navigation has also been there. But you have to &#8220;pay&#8221; for it. A concept lost on most android owners.</p>
<p>While yes they are now ripping off features from one another. There are a lot more features floating from Apple to Google than vise-versa.</p>
<p>the next big thing will come from Apple not google.</p>
<p>You mark my words.</p>
<p>And here I am again suckered into another meaningless android vs. apple debate.</p>
<blockquote>Apple is still very much the innovation leader</blockquote>
<p>iOS 6 has almost no innovation outside of Passbook.</p>
<blockquote>urn by turn navigation has also been there. But you have to "pay" for it. A concept lost on most android owners.</blockquote>
<p>So let me get this straight. You&#8217;re defending Apple for making it&#8217;s users pay for a feature that is completely free on Android?</p>
<blockquote>the next big thing will come from Apple not google.</blockquote>
<p>Maybe. But Google have already shown us the next big thing that they&#8217;re working on ie. project Glass, and if I get the choice to buy a locked down TV that is only going to play Apple sanctioned content or a Google project that is absurdly customizable and easily hackable, I know what I&#8217;m going to choose.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t passbook sad Google Wallet? It&#8217;s just the carriers can&#8217;t not allow passbook.</p>
<p>Also on the Apple TV thing, I agree I want a dumb monitor. A very pretty, hd, big dumb monitor. And a box that cost $100 ($300 at max) that I hook up into my amp.</p>
<p>Innovation exactly where? and how are you calling Surface a shameless rip off&#8230;i mean exactly what was ripped off from Apple ?</p>
<p>Apple bought Siri as Google bought the technology behind voice and they both slapped it on their phones and patted themselves on the back&#8230;Even Steve Wozniak recently claimed that Siri went to the shithouse after Apple go their hands on it&#8230;By the way if you want to see what real voice capability on a phone should be like watch the Windows Phone 8 keynote and the description of what speech recognition is supposed to be like in this day and age&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple is ripping of MS (especially in integration of socia into their platform, alerts and gestures which MS has shown for ages on Windows 8 and WinPhone 7) that hw technology goes&#8230;The difference is Apple feels it can borrow a concept, patent it (if not already patented ) and then take anyone who releases anything resembling it to court&#8230;</p>
<p>The iPhone has reached the end of the line in terms of innovation and its taken 5 years to basically deliver essentially moderate improvements to the basic concept over all that time.</p>
<p>heres an idea&#8230;how bout Apple lets me use IOS apps on my macbook? or allow me to publish iBooks directly to the device without any store involved&#8230;.or heres a really good one which the engineers at Apple should be able to figure out, a USB or SD slot on any of their mobile devices that allow me to use a real camera and plug the chip into the tablet or put a document on a key and plug it into the tablet? Oh wait hats right, that wouldn&#8217;t be innovative cause Android has already done that :( as has everyone else yet Apple still not delivering the bacis and their users not having the sense to demand it&#8230;</p>
<p>Have fun playing with your toys and spending too much for them&#8230;</p>
<p>I seem to remember my OG Droid (circa 2009) having voice support for commands such as &#8220;Listen to&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Note to self&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Navigate to&#8230;&#8221;.  With Siri, Apple may have tweaked the formula, but don&#8217;t pretend that Google Now is a ripoff of Siri when the opposite is true.</p>
<p>I personally support Apple ripping off wholesale Maps from Google.  A good alternative pushes Google to do better (though honestly, they&#8217;ve been doing quite well innovating by themselves &#8212; street view, 3D maps, turn-by-turn navigation, local, traffic, subway times, etc.).</p>
<p>This conversation was going so well until you posted.</p>
<p>I agree for most with your opinion. I would however argue that most people are underestimating the importance of Google Now.<br />
Although announced as an improvement to search it represents a new platform and a new point of view in mobile experience. A mobile that does what you need before you ask for it and learns your pattern and behaviour takes away the pain and time wasted from many tasks.</p>
<p>I Have been working for the past 9 months with my company on a product based on the same idea although developed differently. We were building to be a web application, but google has &#8220;destroyed&#8221; us in a way, getting to market first, integrating the solution in their OS and finally making use of their extensive potential knowledge: search history.</p>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s the future for mobile devices, they know you and work for you behind the scenes making things faster and easier.</p>
<p>I &#8220;hate them&#8221; (not really&#8230; maybe) but I can&#8217;t wait for this update on my Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>I am sure the Verizon Nexus owers who took forever to get to 4.0.4 will agree with you.</p>
<p>Great, what phone are your are releasing your ROM for?  Oh wait&#8230;.</p>
<p>Agreed, I&#8217;m currently running JB on my Verizon Nexus, and the changes are actually pretty few.  Google Now is nice, but it&#8217;s effectively an app.  My question is:  Why do manufacturer changes <em>have </em> to go to the kernel level?  There are plenty of custom launchers in the Play store that change quite a bit with the user experience.  I mean, why can&#8217;t manufacturers just make and install custom launchers/apps?  If they did this, then users who wanted their phones completely stock could uninstall/disable the launcher or apps.  Updates would be so much easier in this case.  Should Google assert that open source does not apply for manufacturers?</p>
<p>The real reason why manufacturers like to modify so much of the OS is because they want the experience on their phone to be different from the experience on other Android phones. For some reason they think this will get more people to buy their phones rather than the phones from other manufacturers.</p>
<p>I am willing to bet that the update from ICS to JB is more than just minimal. It sounds as if the most of the behind the scenes stuff to makeup &#8220;Project Butter&#8221; and the new Google Search and Google Now are bigger updates than people give credit too.  I like to call myself a geeek but the whole project butter stuff went over my head, but it sonds like they redesigned how android works as a whole. You know OEMS will be having issues getting it to work with its skins. Now ROmS like you metioned should be easier ( at least I hope as it might be the same issue )</p>
<p>About a week ago I was on Droid-Life reading the comments in a &#8220;what do you want in Jelly Bean&#8221; post, and of course someone said for it to be smooth. Then a guy explained how the &#8220;smooth OS&#8217;s&#8221; are slower at doing things while Android is fast, yet a bit &#8220;jagged&#8221; and how a smooth yet fast OS would be a technical marvel&#8230; A couple days later Project Butter was released.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t necessarily &#8216;redesign&#8217; Android to incorporate Project Butter. The inherent problem with Android (as per my knowledge&#8230; Pardon me if i am wrong) is that the &#8216;Touch Input&#8217; thread didn&#8217;t have a high priority. In programming, you have to use threads for assigning tasks. iOS and windows phone both assign the highest priority to a touch input whereas in Android, the touch input thread was given equal precedence compared to other thread.</p>
<p>In layman terms, if you had a thread running loading of images and you touched the screen, iOS would stop any runnng thread (put it on hold) and give the touch input highest precedence and cpu time to run. On the Android pre JB, the task would actually line up in a queue and not get highest priority. This is why iOS always feels more &#8216;responsive&#8217; than Android.</p>
<p>The reason why Google implemented such a mechanism was to incorporate the low spec devices&#8230; However, the high end phones also suffered from this. Apple never really cared as they only cater to a few devices.</p>
<p>With JB update, they seem to have upped the requirement and now se hardware has matured enough, they can easily just implement the internals as iOS has&#8230; So don&#8217;t fall under the marketing stuff companies use like &#8216;butter&#8217; and all&#8230;. It&#8217;s not a huge upgrade and should have been there from day 1 on ICS the day it released for high end phones. About time they implemented this.</p>
<p>They are minor changes? I thought all the Android fans were claiming that iOS 6 with over 200 new features was a letdown compared to the awesome new Jelly Bean update.</p>
<p>FYI: From the technical PoV, iOS6 hasn&#8217;t changed at all compared to iOS5. Features != technical changes.</p>
<p>iOS already has Project Butter since 2007 and Google Now (aka Siri) since 2011, so what technical POV needs to change. Why fix something that ain&#8217;t broke?</p>
<p>rom flashing is risky. My galaxytab  just bricked after working flawlessly for 2 weeks with ics cyanogen 9. It simply stopped and doesnt even charge. I should have seen the signs (constant daily reboots, crashing apps etc&#8230; ). Had to take it into the service centre but my warranty si void since I can&#8217;t even power it up into bootloader to unroot the device.</p>
<p>my wife&#8217;s 8.9 is exhibiting the same symptoms so I may just flash back stock Gtab rom and unroot the device.</p>
<p>I have flashed dozens of ROMs, and in the end it feels like a big waste of time. First, the rooting/flashing process is rarely as simple as advertised. If any part of the process doesn&#8217;t work you&#8217;re left to comb message boards for help. Half the message board posts are people getting yelled at for asking a question that&#8217;s been answered already.</p>
<p>Once you succeed it takes a couple of days to get your homescreens, apps, widgets, keyboard and accounts all set up to your liking. And then a few days later you realize there&#8217;s some gaping flaw in the ROM, like your GPS crashes, or your gmail notifications don&#8217;t refresh, or it randomly reboots. So you start all over again. For a while this is kind of fun, but then you realize none of these ROMs are as stable as the stupid ROM you started with.</p>
<p> At this point I&#8217;m with Josh &#8211; Nexus or no thank you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not flashing ton of rom on all my phones.<br />
The xperia ray: this is the work phone: only stable and fully functional rom, once I get the rom that do the work fine, I leave it there until the newer version with huge benefit over older one come.<br />
The nexus s: this is the toy phone, I flashing anything I think it fun for me to do, mod all the app, try all themes, launcher, su tools, overclocking, etc&#8230; even with all this stuff, I rarely need someone to help, 9o% stuff I flashed with cwm not hang my phone &#8211; just FC, worst thing happen when flashing kernels is boot loop, never brick, never self restart.</p>
<p>If I playing with the phone I work with, I will feel the same with you, but I know it will so I avoided it.</p>
<p>Lol @ having to rely on unpaid unknown devs to get your expensive less than two year old device on a new OS version.</p>
<p>I prefer the new additions in Jelly Bean over the new additions in ICS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready for more leaks</p>
<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m66hrxkaHb1qzvc2yo1_400.gif" /></p>
<p>The only reason I decided to try Android was because of the Galaxy Nexus &#8220;direct from Google&#8221; scheme and their commitment to bringing pure Android updates as soon as they&#8217;re ready.</p>
<p>Jellybean will hit my phone later this month and it will be awesome. People say that iOS leaves you feeling shackled, but I can&#8217;t imagine being stuck on a crap subsidized device on a crap carrier with no planned updates in sight.</p>
<p>As an iPhone user, you can imagine why the Galaxy Nexus tempted me away:  real software support. Are you paying attention, carriers? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>Most carriers only really delay updates by 1-3 days.</p>
<p>Verizon does so by 1-3 months. Welcome to &#8217;Merica.</p>
<p>truer words may have never been said. vzw is the worst with updates&#8230; picking the Droid RAZR for this article exemplifies them at their worst.</p>
<p>I really wish I had taken VZW&#8217;s delay in even getting the Galaxy Nexus as a sign of things to come and waited for Google to sell the Nexus directly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true &#8211; the LTE Nexus does get updates slower than the HSPA+ Nexus. But to be honest, it was really easy to not only root my phone, but also so get Jelly Bean on there early. And Jelly Bean is FANTASTIC.</p>
<p>I had JB on my VZW G-Nex before all Razr owners had ICS. That&#8217;s just sad, but also an amazing testament to the awesome Devs working on the G-Nex. You guys Rock!</p>
<p>Is all the hardware completely operational? I use my phone a lot so I don&#8217;t wanna be out LTE or anything</p>
<p>Yes.  I&#8217;m running it as well, and though there was a boot loop scare, clearing the cache fixed it and it&#8217;s been running great since.  It really is quite a bit smoother in regular use.  LTE works, and it also seems to switch from Wifi to cellular much faster than 4.0 (this may have been fixed in the recent 4.0.4 update).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say if you aren&#8217;t crazy about rooting, don&#8217;t bother updating.  Some of the changes are nice, but mostly it&#8217;s an incremental upgrade (Notifications are prettier/more useful, Google Now is ok, OS is overall smoother, etc).</p>
<p>The GS2 for Spring(Epic 4G Touch) still has not received an ICS update, and yet almost all other GS2 variants have.  I&#8217;m running an Alpha of CM9 on my Epic 4G Touch using the kernel from leaked ICS builds, no source available yet.  We&#8217;re all just waiting for an official ICS release so that we can get the kernel source, and then the phone can start to get official CM9 updates, and true UV and OC.</p>
<p>Not the Skyrocket.</p>
<p>It took AT&amp;T, what, two and a half months to roll out ICS for the GSII? The GSII LTE only started getting ICS last week, so I figure the Skyrocket will get ICS&#8230;.. in two and a half months?</p>
<p>i&#8217;m in the same boat, and ordered a gnex, since the epic 4g touch isn&#8217;t mine anyway. (work phone) and the gnex can be had for pennies compared to other devices&#8230;</p>
<p>Hey why update your Droid RAZR when Verizon can try to convince you to get the Droid RAZR XL SUPER MAXXX with Jelly Bean!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t blame Verizon. If carriers were at fault then all tablets would already be on ICS.</p>
<p>Why spend a ton of energy upgrading tablets that haven&#8217;t sold very well?</p>
<p>Because they promised!!! PROMISED!!</p>
<p>except that way more tablets are on ICS than phones&#8230; so yeah, the carriers do play a role. Pretty much all 10.1 tablets are on ICS.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s &#8220;free market&#8221; for ya!</p>
<p>I think you mean 1-3 months.</p>
<p>Nope, the HTC One X released 1.29, took around 1-5 days for all carriers to roll it out. Those who were on unlocked handsets got it instantly.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re taking about the international version, the US is a totally different story.  Additionally, the One X released with ICS so any update it received early on was likely only a minor maintenance update.</p>
<p>Right, which is the main version of the One X.</p>
<p>So stick to main versions, and you will be fine.</p>
<p>The &#8220;main version&#8221;? What are you even talking about?</p>
<p>Variants will always get updates slower.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the only &#8220;Variant&#8221; (the AT&amp;T or sprint version) that is available in our country.</p>
<p>You clearly have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Ummm, no, very few people buy the int&#8217;l version of a phone. Most people like paying $200, not $500 for a phone, and so even though I agree int&#8217;l is faster for updates, it lacks adoption compared to carrier branded devices. So you&#8217;re wrong, carriers do slow updates down.</p>
<p>but what about the non-US Galaxy Nexus (updated not by Google, but by Samsung)? are the carriers the ones delaying the updates?</p>
<p>Only if by days you mean months, then it starts to make sense.</p>
<p>Agreed. The Nexus devices are the only ones I would consider in the Android arena. When I first went Android, I got the Nexus One. Unfortunately, between the light sensor issues, AT&amp;T delaying updates, the OLED being little more than a beautiful piece of grey glass in the Florida Sunlight, I couldn&#8217;t keep the Nexus. Had the Nexus One been just . . . 10% better as a hardware device, I might have never gone back to iPhone.</p>
<p>Damn mine is still running fine on T-mobile. I gave it to a family member.</p>
<p>While I agree that the Nexus One has some h/w issues, I don&#8217;t understand your claim that AT&amp;T delayed updates. Was AT&amp;T involved in approval of Nexus One updates? I purchased a Nexus One, AT&amp;T banded, in May 2010 and kept the N1 updated thru Froyo and GB as  soon as Google released updates and patches.  My N1 is still unrooted and stock. Granted, I didn&#8217;t always wait for OTA updates and would manually download and apply the signed updates via the stock recovery. N1 was easy to update.</p>
<p>I bought mine in March and still hadn&#8217;t received the OTA Froyo update by the middle of June. T-Mobile users started seeing OTA updates on May 22, and AT&amp;T users didn&#8217;t see it come up until Jun 28. I had already jumped ship by that point due to the aforementioned hardware issues, another one of which I remembered &#8211; the proximity of the capacitive home/back/menu/search buttons to on-screen buttons (like the spacebar). That drove me NUTS. Hit the space bar, instead get booted to the home screen.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T now has a much less adversarial approach to Android, so a Galaxy nexus is probably a really nice bet.</p>
<p>Yes, HTC did jack up the capacitive buttons :-) The user workaround was (is) to press at a 50% offset upwards towards the actual display. Inexcusable flaw!</p>
<p>At least in the US, the carriers always have to certify what goes on any device attached to their network.  This is one piece of the delay in official updates.</p>
<p>But the Nexus One was never officially released for AT&amp;T (at least not through them directly). It was released through Google with compatibility for AT&amp;T bands, and AT&amp;T had no control of it.</p>
<p>If it delivers through their network they have to support it.  Partly this is due to FCC regulations and partly because you don&#8217;t want a device causing network issues.  Considering you have to get a sim from ATT I&#8217;d imagine they are involved to some degree.</p>
<p>But they are not involved at all. The phone just happens to be compatible with 3G bands. The same phone works on any other 3G carrier just as well (T-Moble, Rogers). The updates come from Google and need no interaction from these dozens of carriers.</p>
<p>Carriers have to certify devices on their networks, under FCC regulations they are responsible for the cell traffic on their networks.  So I assume using a phone like that without their input is in some kind of violation.</p>
<p>Then I guess Google is in violation.</p>
<p>Except it&#8217;s not enough to just get a Nexus device. You have to buy it directly from Google&#8217;s store if you want the updates or else the updates are handled by Samsung which still can&#8217;t manage to push them out in a timely fashion despite the lack of any extensive customization.  Of course Google only makes the &#8220;real&#8221; Nexus phones available in a select few markets so it&#8217;s not even an option for most people. That&#8217;s all with unsubsidized unlocked phones and without ever involving the local carriers.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was a real eye-opener for me when I bought my Gnex online.  It turned out to be a Canadian version, updated by Samsung, not Google.   When April rolled around and I was STILL on 4.01 (4.03 had been out for ages and 4.04 had just been released), I decided to flash to stock 4.04.</p>
<p>It was surprisingly easy (after the mounds of research I did online first), but still out-of-reach of your average user.  Google should fix this going forward.  A Nexus should be a Nexus should be a Nexus.</p>
<p>Well, i have an unsubsidized GSM GNex that was NOT purchased through Google Play (but rather a retail store), and yet it has a yakju build, meaning updates are handled by Google. So far i&#8217;ve got OTA updates (namely 4.0.3 and 4.0.5) the very same day they were released by Google.</p>
<p>So saying that every GNex that&#8217;s bought outside of Google Play is updated by Samsung and not Google is untrue. Some are handled by Google (most of them, really) and some are handled by Samsung. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the case in Google Play, though: if Google Play devices are all yakju builds, then by all means it is good to be sure Google will handle them directly.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, i&#8217;m pretty sure my country is not one of those &#8220;select few markets&#8221;. So bottomline, outside of the US, you still get a pretty good chance that your unsubsidized GNex will be updated by Google.</p>
<p>Not to mention that even if it is not a Jakju build, you can still change your build code rather easily to a jakju build and thus getting the updates from Google anyway.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>As an iPhone use considering a change at the end of the year I am only considering the iPhone 5 or the Nexus 4 as my next phone.</p>
<p>Nexus phones are the only way to go in my opinion, and the only phones that run Android. All other &#8220;Android&#8221; phones run other OSes, but can run Android apps.</p>
<p>Factually untrue. Opinion has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>I disagree and think it is an opinion, and one that i agree with.  Some of the heavily &#8220;skinned&#8221; Android devices are as much Android as the Grid tablet.  He&#8217;s right in the only similarities they have are they both run Android apps.  That&#8217;s why I think Android will always be inferior to iOS and WP because of the fragmentation issue.  There are dozens of different &#8220;versions&#8221; of Android that an OS manual for one skinned Android device won&#8217;t be compatible with another.  It&#8217;s one thing to change the color and the fonts and the themes, but these &#8220;skins&#8221; are major overhauls that for the most part are vastly inferior to vanilla.  It would be one thing if the skins actually made the device better, but they always make the device worse.  Always.  There might be a few decent features that a skin has that vanilla doesn&#8217;t, but all the extra bullshit in  there cancels out anything good about the skin and then some.</p>
<p>Currently there&#8217;s only one Android device being sold right now, the Galaxy Nexus.  All the other ones are no more than knockoffs.</p>
<p>except not really.</p>
<p>Well that is just objectively false. You can see it how you like but they run Android.</p>
<p>Although you&#8217;re right, i can see where he&#8217;s coming from. What he&#8217;s saying, essentially, is that it may run Android, but you don&#8217;t get the Android experience: instead, you get the Touchwiz, Sense, Blur, or whatever-sony-calls-there-own experience.</p>
<p>Those devices are running Android, yes. But as far as the user experience is concerned, they could be running completely different OS&#8217;s and none would be the wiser, except for all of them running Android applications.</p>
<p>So the only devices that are running Android as Google intended are, indeed, the Nexus devices.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call Sony&#8217;s the Xperience.</p>
<p>The problem is that us geeks are a really small minority.  Most of their customers doesn&#8217;t even know about ICS or Jelly Bean.  So they have no real incentive to update the current phones when they can tout the new feature on a whole new phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is as true as you think. There is a good deal of advertising that brags about which version of the OS the phone is running. Not as many people are left in the dark anymore especially with the help of social media.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t care.. My cousin works at a T-mobile store so she knows all of the differences between ICS and GB and she know that JB is on it&#8217;s way. She is a casual user so when ICS on her GS2 changed the phone app slightly she went back to GB because all of the new ICS features don&#8217;t mean anything to her.</p>
<p>I coudn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>That assumes the phone was stable before.  What if it wasn&#8217;t?   The update might have made the difference.  If you never get it&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Her phone was stable both times.. She didn&#8217;t notice the performance boost because she is a casual user. She doesn&#8217;t care for the theme changes. As far as she concerned it was the old phone app or the new multitasking. So she went with the old phone app. Mind you she knows every feature on the GSIII and is pretty knowledgeable about phones she worked for VZW before Tmo.</p>
<p>Customers don&#8217;t care about OS updates until it impacts them personally. I was in a meeting today where a client asked why their new Android phone couldn&#8217;t get Google Chrome. He may not have understood my answer entirely, but he certainly understood the larger concept of being left behind.</p>
<p>And as more and more Android users find themselves 2 or 3 major OS versions behind, they&#8217;re bound to start coming to the same conclusions. Will it impact sales? Who can say? But it certainly needs to be addressed on some level (even if it&#8217;s just in Google&#8217;s own Nexus marketing.)</p>
<p>Exactly. I have an Optimus T, and it bugged me to no end that, since it was stuck on FroYo, I couldn&#8217;t install Temple Run.</p>
<p>so, will Samsung release Jelly Bean for many non-US Galaxy Nexus (updated by them instead of Google)?</p>
<p>Google will release that update as well in most cases, as they also handle most non-US GNex themselves. Devices dealt by Samsung are in minority.</p>
<p>The market has to reject skinned versions of Android and pick Nexus devices. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Which is difficult to attain when Apple is now working to block those stock devices&#8230; ala the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>As a 4-time iPhone owner and a recent switcher to the GSM Galaxy Nexus, it saddens me to see Apple stifling innovation when the experiences are VASTLY different in day-to-day use. If my career (graphic designer) weren&#8217;t so tied in to the Mac ecosystem, I would vow never to buy another Apple product&#8230; at least until they stop these tiresome policies.</p>
<p>I understand what you&#8217;re saying, but looking at it from Apple&#8217;s perspective&#8230; when Steve Jobs saw his company fall to Windows in the eighties because an insider, Bill Gates, took a developer&#8217;s copy of the OS and copied it.. he worked overtime to make sure no developers found out about the iPhone prerelease. So, when Eric Schmidt, a member of their board, was found to be working on a competing OS, and one that copied them, and once again over took the company, Apple was very upset.  Even though it was years ago, Apple still has passion left in them to slow Android or make them pay patent royalties however possible.  Apple did work with Samsung to stop the patent wars before they started, but Samsung didn&#8217;t work with them.  I know the patent wars aren&#8217;t right, but I just wanted to say that it&#8217;s not a simple, clear cut case.</p>
<blockquote> Even though it was years ago </blockquote>
<p>and that&#8217;s because it takes so long for patents to be granted; they would have sued on android launch otherwise. <br />
what people forget is we are watching a protracted, drawn out war.</p>
<p>1)  This is so full of Apple&#8217;s propaganda.  I HATE MS But they did not steal a developers copy of Mac OS, nor did they copy Mac OS. Both Mac and Windows copied it based off Xerox&#8217;s work.  Nor was Bill Gates an insider.   Also Android was in development earlier than iOS, and far earlier than Eric Schmidt could have copied them. It started development at Android Inc in 2003, and Android Inc was merged into Google in 2005. And Eric Schmidt wasn&#8217;t asked to serve on Apple&#8217;s board until 2006.</p>
<p>2) It really is a clear cut case in that many software developers, and most organizations for promoting both intellectual property and consumer rights agree that software patents are ridiculous.  We already have something for protecting our code, it&#8217;s called copyright. We don&#8217;t need patents that stop others from doing similar things.  These crazy back and forth battles (Apple and Google OEM&#8217;s have filed and won similar amount of patent claims, depending on country, and often decisions flip back and forth on appeals), and massive amounts of money spent on obtaining patents and waging legal battle&#8217;s have to stop. This stifle&#8217;s innovation, and crushes small companiess.</p>
<p>I thought development of the iPad started in like 2001 (Steve Jobs Biography)?</p>
<p>Perhaps, I don&#8217;t remember. But not iOS.  iOS is the evolution of iPhone OS and came with iPhone development in 2005.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;But when Sculley saw the software, he was enraged. <strong>Microsoft had been provided early prototypes of the Macintosh and some source code</strong> to help optimize Word and MultiPlan. Now Windows had a menu bar almost identical to Apple&#8217;s. Windows even had a &#8216;Special&#8217; menu, containing disk operations. Other elements were strikingly similar. Windows came bundled with Write and Paint, both mimicking Apple&#8217;s MacPaint and MacWrite.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>The Mac/Windows history was much more complicated than either side would like to admit. See for instance <a href="http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/apple-vs-microsoft.html" target="_blank">http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/apple-vs-microsoft.html</a></p>
<p>oh your going that far back&#8230;ahh ok well thanks to MS saving Apple from bankruptcy and bailing them out to the tune of $150-200 Million in 1997 so in a way MS is Apple&#8217;s father&#8230;</p>

<p>Funny that Apple had over USD1bn in the bank when M$ &#8216;bailed&#8217; them out <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-202143.html" target="_blank">http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-202143.html</a></p>
<p>yeh but without the apps commitment as well as the money it was going to be byes byes for apple most certainly&#8230;.</p>
<p>amazing that with the 1 billion they were still struggling&#8230;but yeh a marketing company in its soul, what can i say&#8230;</p>
<p>this comment from steve jobs was particularly interesting:</p>
<p>&#8220;‘We have to let go of a few notions here. We have to let go of the notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft needs to lose.’"</p>
<p>Yes, and if you really want to beleive they copied that from the early prototype in that little time you can. But it&#8217;s much more likely that they copied from the same source Apple did which they had much more time to copy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface#Xerox_PARC" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface#Xerox_PARC</a></p>

<p>Android started out as a Blackberry clone. Only after Schmidt was on the Apple board and saw the unreleased iPhone did the direction migrate to an iPhone clone.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this well known by now?</p>
<p>Well known but false. They developed both the keyboarded and touch prototypes simultaneously and the SDK was released with support for both, and videos of both prototypes when it was ready in 2007. <a href="http://mobile.osnews.com/printer.php?news_id=25264" target="_blank">http://mobile.osnews.com/printer.php?news_id=25264</a></p>
<p>Android was a pre-iPhone OS. Now it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Stop the B.S. Apple is global corp just like Google or MS don&#8217;t drink the kool-aid. Apple happened to see 3 years into the future of the phone market because they had the luxury of being a huge personal electronic device maker and not having ANY current products in the market. They were then able to study every major phone company and single out all of their strengths and put them into one product. They deserve billions of dollars for succesfully doing this but they do not deserve their self righteous attitude. Apple copies better than anyone&#8230;</p>
<p>The iPhone was NOT the first phone to&#8230;<br />
-have a notification shade<br />
-have lock screen notifications<br />
-have voice services and searches (I had a limited version on a 2005 Samsung thanks Nuance)<br />
-have an app store<br />
- have yearly hardware refreshes<br />
-have carrier exclusivity contracts<br />
-have cloud services<br />
-have a minimalist design<br />
-have the software specifically made for the hardware and vice versa<br />
-introduce a consumer based smartphone<br />
-integrate with iTunes<br />
-have an icon based interface<br />
-have a modern web browser</p>
<p>I could go on and on.. I believe the only thing Apple was first at was pinch to zoom.. Take a simplified Palm OS, an LG Prada, and launch it identically to the Sidekick and you have an iPhone.. They even started limited and built on hardware and software features year by year which flew in the face of the industry norm. I&#8217;m not taking nothing from Apple just telling it like it is. The Sidekick and the iPod launched around the same time and destroyed the competition. The next time Apple launched a P.E.D. it would be a phone and was launched in an identical manner to the Sidekick.</p>
<p>Sure you would. These sob stories about how apple has hurt your feelings are just a lame attempt by android fanboys to turn the table on apple.</p>
<p>Why is it you get upset about what Apples doing yet when it comes to android and it&#8217;s OEMs ripping Apple off your ok with it? As an artist, I&#8217;d expect you to be more upset about that than Apple trying to protect what they&#8217;ve created.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an android fanboy by any means, yodaddy.</p>
<p>I have owned nothing buy Macs since 1997 and I haven&#8217;t owned anything other than an iPhone since the first one was released. My household currently has 6 Apple devices in daily use.</p>
<p>I get protecting IP, but the patents in question here are incredibly lame.</p>
<p>I should also note that I have been an Apple stockholder since 2002, and have been rethinking that position, as well.</p>
<p>Then from a business prospective you are an idiot.</p>
<p>Giving up your stock means you give up any direct vote to change Apple&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>If so, graphic designers sure earn well these days. :)</p>
<p>+1<br />
Actually&#8230; good ones do,<br />
but not well enough to affect the business strategies of the largest corporation in the world.</p>
<p>Haha</p>
<p>Yeah, my paltry shares (in the whole scheme of things) really matter to Apple&#8217;s  board of directors.</p>
<p>From a practical PERspective, YOU are an idiot.</p>
<p>They entitle you to attend the Annual Shareholder Meeting and ask a question.</p>
<p>- Why Apple is so&#8230;<br />
- Next!</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t 1998. You don&#8217;t need a Mac to do graphic design anymore. I&#8217;m studying graphic design and I use PC and Mac. Macs tend to perform worse.</p>
<p>Not true.<br />
Yes, UX and interactive development are platform agnostic, but<br />
print and packaging design are still very much a Mac-only world.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m a design and i agree. The problem is much more the people in this &#8220;area&#8221; than the  plataform itself. You can get much better monitor for professional uses. You can get faster pc with windows but if the industries work with mac than this means nothing, in the end of the day we need to send a file in mac format.</p>
<p>I work with graphics and product and is like 2 totally different words. Product is pc-only and graphic is a mac-world.</p>
<p>so you mean to say that indesign will create different files for Mac and Windows? Or photoshop will create a mac specific and windows specific PSD?</p>
<p>hell, a lot of printers now request to receive the final file in PDF.</p>
<p>the output files are cross platform. Most printers now will also accept both windows and mac specific files; which if you&#8217;re using the industry software, it&#8217;s all standardized.</p>
<p>our external agency are all Mac and i can edit and manipulate and create the final file on my Win 7 laptop/desktop. We do printing on our end.</p>
<p>There really isn&#8217;t any difference now, that&#8217;s why there are plenty of agencies out there that run an all windows setup.</p>
<p>Please explain. What programs/files are you talking about? I use PDF:s to print.</p>
<blockquote>The market has to reject skinned versions of Android and pick Nexus device</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. The market has shown, time and time again, that it doesn&#8217;t particularly care about the reference Nexus devices. On a site like The Verge, it seems the reference phone is in the &#8220;want&#8221; list of everyone but as far as I know all Nexus phones have been pretty mediocre sellers. Ditto for upgrades.</p>
<p>Then again, remember how some internet geeks used to claim &#8220;I&#8217;ll never buy Samsung because they broke their upgrade promise?&#8221;  Ultimately it doesn&#8217;t matter much. What matters the most is the maker&#8217;s ability to deliver good looking hardware in time to the maximum number of distribution channel.</p>
<p>And the Nexus phones (the ones sold by carriers) don&#8217;t have bloatware to pad their margins. Thus, carriers will incentivize sales reps to push other devices. Vicious circle&#8230;</p>
<p>Huh? Three UK sell the Galaxy Nexus for free on alot of plans.</p>
<p>You can get almost any phone here for free; iPhone, SGIII, HTC OX&#8230;..even a Lumina.</p>
<p>I can get a Chevy free on contract?  Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>On second thought&#8230;I&#8217;ll pass&#8230;I&#8217;ll wait for the Impala.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you go into a verizon store they will actively try and tell you not to buy the Galaxy Nexus, that it&#8217;s crap, and they will try and direct you to their crappy android phones, or feature phones that they make huge margins on.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that if review sites like The Verge and Engadget REALLY panned the phones with carrier skins (for instance, the GSIII getting a 4 on software), that it might translate into measurable sales declines and in turn a change in policy.</p>
<p>Stock is a superior experience, and everyone knows it.<br />
Let&#8217;s hold these hardware drones accountable, new media!</p>
<p>The problem with that approach is that the review wouldn&#8217;t be a fair one.  The customizations don&#8217;t detract from the experience THAT much, and in fact, in some cases they fill gaps or smooth rough edges in the vanilla Android.</p>
<p>Also, features from carrier skins tend to find their way into later stock Android releases.</p>
<p>I would say that delaying software updates by 8 months would be seriously detracting from the ownership experience, no?</p>
<p>I would say that merits a massive downgrade in the software category.</p>
<p>I would agree that they detract, but I would argue they do not constitute a &#8220;massive&#8221; downgrade, at least not for your typical user.  Most Android device reviews that I&#8217;ve read do mention the possible issue with OS upgrades, which is at least something.</p>
<p>At this point, can&#8217;t we at least agree that the software update issue is much closer to &#8220;certain&#8221; that &quot;possible&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>*than &#8220;possible&#8221;?</p>
<p>It depends. It is indeed almost certain that a non-nexus device will get a delay in OS version updates compared to a Nexus device, sure, but that might not be an issue at all for the user.</p>
<blockquote>I can’t help but think that if review sites like The Verge and Engadget REALLY panned the phones with carrier skins (for instance, the GSIII getting a 4 on software),  that it might translate into measurable sales declines </blockquote>
<p>Not going to work. The vast majority of consumers who buy phones couldn&#8217;t care less about The Verge and Engadget but rely on the whim and the recommendation from carriers&#8217; clerks. There is a reason that Nexus One was a dismal failure in sales when it was selling without carrier help.<br />
 <br />
Also not all end consumers will prefer vanilla Android, especially overseas consumers who might be used to particular skins &#8211; for example, the Koreans with TouchWiz or Taiwanese with Sense. They actually LIKE the skinned Android.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not thinking it through.  If the Verge and others  continue a crusade against skins and really, consistently, give low marks for slow updates, then over time it will affect perceptions.  Especially those gatekeepers such as carrier salesman.</p>
<p>Look at windows computers that are loaded with bloatware from device makers.  That&#8217;s a negative in most cases.  But on the other hand, a phone gets boatware and it&#8217;s all good?   It&#8217;s suddenly a feature?</p>
<p>But carriers salesman don&#8217;t reccommend things based on whats good. They have to recommend things based on what the company tells them, which basically is whatever will make the company the most money.  Just try and go to a Verizon store and ask them about the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Agreed&#8230;. plus I am willing to bet that most of us are the people who are commonly asked about &#8220;which phone should I buy?&#8221; within our social and family groups.</p>
<p>No. Contrary to our belief here, the Verge and other tech journals just don&#8217;t have all that much power over the major mainstream mobile market. Again, Nexus One was a big failure in the market despite its technical excellence and all the hype on the internet.</p>
<p>The only way to do it is to forcing carriers and makers to lose their control completely. However the reason they like Android in the first place is because it allows customization to their liking. You cannot have the cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>Sure they have some power.  Vista took a pounding on a daily basis.  MS tried everything they could to overcome the perceptions that followed.</p>
<p>How bout Sprint?  Not much love in the tech blogs over the years.  Perceptions were developed overtime that Sprint is still trying to battle though they&#8217;ve made bad choices as well.</p>
<p>Call it what you will.  Trickle down techonomics..lol  But it starts with the tech blogs,  and trickles down.  If something gets universally shunned, you can bet it will catch on with the mainstream.  On the other side, it&#8217;s all apple apple apple.  Everyone tech blogger seems to have a Mac or iphone.  We&#8217;ll know something is wrong with Apple when that stops being the case.</p>
<p>I think in the case of bloatware on mobile phones.  We want there to be competition for iphone.  They get a pass.  We want windows 8 to be great, MS gets a pass for Metro on a PC even though it&#8217;s a horrible experience.</p>
<blockquote>Everyone tech blogger seems to have a Mac or iphone</blockquote>
<p>Yet Windows PC&#8217;s hold 95% of the global PC market. If you wanted evidence of the disconnect between Tech Blogs and the mainstream audience, you just provided it yourself.</p>
<p>You can if you control the supply of eggs and flour.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen a TV advert for a Nexus device.  If they ever existed, they must have been extremely short-lived.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been hard to avoid the HTC One X and Samsung Galaxy S III adverts that have been airing recently, they seem to be present in every ad break.</p>
<p>Yup, carriers are the ones running the ad campaigns, not Google. If Google wants to change the public perception, that has to change.</p>
<p>&#8230;really?  In the UK, Samsung and HTC are running their own advertising campaigns, completely independent of the networks.</p>
<p>Speaking of One X adverts, it is pretty obvious that AT&amp;T and HTC don&#8217;t know what they are doing in marketing that phone. Why focus on photo burst mode or a dumbass getting lost running to &#8220;Beats Audio&#8221; when you have THE BEST PHONE SCREEN IN THE WORLD?</p>
<p>THAT is a selling point.</p>
<p>Apple and Samsung both seem to have realised that the best way to market a phone is to show people actually using it for normal things.</p>
<p>HTC&#8217;s idea of a use-case is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yszp0vE_Sj8">skydiving photography</a>.</p>
<p>The Sprint One X ad (aka Evo 4G LTE) is on all the time. I can remember a Verizon GNex ad, but it was mostly &#8220;Verizon has great coverage. [last five seconds] get a GNex for the holidays!&#8221; Not exactly about the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Chicken or egg situation as them majority of users just buy whatever is the newest and greatest thing their carrier is offering at time of upgrade. If all they did was sell Nexus devices then that&#8217;s what would be more popular.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that simple., unfortunately.  Yes the skins may add some delay, but it is also about drivers.  Sometimes, the soc manufacturers don&#8217;t get their drivers ported, you can&#8217;t start testing until all the drivers are working.</p>
<p>The thing is, the comments on this site arent representative of the majority of the &#8220;market.&#8221; MOST, not all, but most people are buying an HTC phone, or Samsung phone, etc. The hardcore techies that do care either do buy Nexus, buy a Samsung or HTC for the better hardware and control the software by rooting (like myself), or buy it know ahead of time what they are getting.</p>
<p>For most as long as the apps they want work, they dont care if they have 4.0 or 4.1. And in 2 yrs when they upgrade again that phone will do stuff their previous one didnt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;ll happen if the rumors are true about the 5 nexus devices. Right now google only releases the nexus device on one carrier (sprint got it later). If all 4 carriers get it, the knowledgeable people will surely pick the superior nexus.</p>
<p>I like what Google did with the unlocked at $350 though. I purchased one just because it&#8217;s very hard to resist a fully supported device for that cheap.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Google released the Nexus on dozens of carriers, its simply not possible todo the same in the US due to the CDMA and frequency fragmentation.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?  CDMA frequency has nothing to do with it. There was an exclusivity with Verizon. Sprint got it later when it ended.</p>
<p>Indeed, but he&#8217;s partly right in that it only applied to CDMA (a broken standard that that most of the world has abandoned)  GSM versions were available more most carriers and usually unlocked. Europe pretty much doesn&#8217;t have contracted locked phones, most people buy the unlocked version and then buy service on whichever carrier they choose, without a 2 year contract.</p>
<p>This is right. But i don&#8217;t see that happening even on our GSM networks since LTE is operated at different spectrum. Google does offer the HSPA+ version for $350 from the play store. It&#8217;s the best option if you&#8217;re on AT&amp;T or Tmobile.</p>
<p>Who is going to explain to the customer that the Nexus is a trouble free purchase? Google need to do some heavy marking and shop floor staff need to be incentivised, not to mention carriers need to be pacified too.</p>
<p>The availability of the Nexus has not been a problem.</p>
<p>Yes please .. #boycottapple #boycottnonstockandroiddevices. Too bad the &#8220;market&#8221; is filled with a bunch of nord lemmings. ;)</p>
<p>Nord lemmings?</p>
<p>This definitely should not happen. Unless you want the market of android to disappear. If there is barely anything differentiating device manufacturers, the area for competing becomes as small as a pinhole. oh .1 ghz faster. gonna go with that one. oh 5 dollars cheaper gotta go with that one. Loss of areas for competition will cause many manufacturers to go under.</p>
<p>I disagree. I think hardware IS enough to differentiate. Spec wise, the GSIII out does the One X, but the One X just looks nicer. Specs aren&#8217;t the entirety of hardware, design is important too.</p>
<p>Solves one, creates plenty of others.</p>
<p>Long story short: if you want timely upgrades (or upgrades at all), get a nexus device or be willing to install custom ROMs</p>
<p>As true as this is it sort of goes against the whole &#8220;choice&#8221; thing with Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get this phone or get a crap long term experience&#8221; isn&#8217;t really choice.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t that what iPhone users also say about other mobile OS&#8217;s?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry I don&#8217;t understand what you mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;Get an iPhone or get a crap long term experience. &quot;</p>
<p>But they arent getting a &#8220;crap long term experience.&#8221; They are getting the same experience they got when the purchased their phone (so on an S3, a pretty great one). Which is all the vast majority of people care about. Tech sites not included.</p>
<p>Until they can&#8217;t run an app because they are running an outdated version of the OS.</p>
<p>And from a totally anecdotal side, I know of a few non techy Android users who are wondering why they don&#8217;t have &#8216;Ice Cream&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until they can’t run an app because they are running an outdated version of the OS&#8221;</p>
<p>NEVER once have i ever seen that happen. Unless you keep your phone for 5 years and never update it, in which case thats your fault. If anything its the opposite, the people on the bleeding edge sometimes get broken apps because the developers have been too lazy to update their app quickly.</p>
<p>Erm, how about the flagship browser by the creator of the OS&#8230;Chrome. Not usable by 92.2% of Android users.</p>
<p>Thats not exactly the same IMO. That WAS a beta app designed from the ground up for ICS. Its not like some app people had been using for a year all of a sudden got updated and THEN stopped working.</p>
<p>It IS the same. Why are you talking about?</p>
<p>I never said an existing app stopping working. I just said &#8220;Until they can’t run an app because they are running an outdated version of the OS.&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which Chrome, a first party app, is an example of.</p>
<p>One example doesn&#8217;t validate the argument.  That would be like saying all the iphones that don&#8217;t run Siri are outdated and no good.</p>
<p>I never said outdated and no good. And it is stupid that Siri isn&#8217;t on the iP4, but S-voice isn&#8217;t on the Galaxy S II or II either&#8230;</p>
<p>But at least the iP4 can support all iOS5 (and soon 6) API&#8217;s.</p>
<p>You said &#8220;crap long term experience.&#8221; You think not having access to Chrome mobile is going to make someones GSII all of sudden suck (if hypothetically it wasnt getting ICS soon)?? No , its just a feature their new phone will have when they upgrade in year or whenever. Just like Siri is just something iPhone 4 owners know their next iPhone will have. Average consumer really dont care about this stuff like we do.</p>
<p>I think people do care, and I think people see a difference between something that comes with an OS/Phone (Siri, S-voice) and an app you download from a store (like the unsupported Chrome).</p>
<p>Splitting hairs. Its the same thing. If Apple had waited until Siri was out of &#8220;beta&#8221; to push it to phones with an OTA update, and the 4S got it that way and the 4 didnt no one would care. Well the same hand full of ppl would care, but not the avg ppl that are still buying the iphone 4 or GSII at a discount and  will be perfectly content with their phone until their next upgrade.</p>
<p>Yes, but people who are paying a premium at device launch expect to be able to basically do whatever they want with their phone for the entirety of their contract.</p>
<p>Not just Chrome, but any other 4.0+ app.</p>
<p>owning a samsung Gtab 10.1 and 8.9, i went to download a romote control app [not compatible with ur device] then went to download Samsung&#8217;s own remote control app [not compatible with ur device]. They have ONE compatible app from Samsung and it&#8217;s not really compatible.</p>
<p>If you have a Gtab, do a search for samsung remote control and see what i mean.</p>
<p>absolutely. Still waiting for my ics upgrade from Acer&#8230;for over six months now. Will probably never buy an android device in the near future again.</p>
<p>Riiiiight ,   choice.  Android is about chooooice.  I am sitting here with a htc doubleshot with a dual core processor and sufficient memory that is stuck on gingerbread that will never see an update.  It won&#8217;t see an update because it sold like crap so htc won&#8217;t bother.  It sold like crap so t-mobile won&#8217;t push the issue.  HTC unlocker will unlock the bootloader, but it retains S-ON so it is a pain in the ass to flash roms.  There are no significant roms to flash, including CM9 or Miui because it has a keyboard and fancy camera which means proprietary drivers which will never be released by HTC because they are part of the sense rom it runs.  So essentially I have a superfast phone, with great specs, that runs poorly with sense 3.0 that will never see an update.  My response is not, &#8220;wow I should have bought nexus&#8221;, it is &#8220;F&#8221; Google and their broken model and &#8220;F&#8221; HTC and their crap phones that never get updated.</p>
<blockquote>if you want timely upgrades (or upgrades at all), get a nexus</blockquote>
<p>I did that, but I found out that I got the wrong nexus!!!!! &#8230;&#8230;.I&#8217;m still going to buy a nexus phone but from now on if it isn&#8217;t sold directly by google i&#8217;m not touching it with a 34 foot pole</p>
<p>For updates to work as the cell phone business model stands now, the manufactures need to strong arm the carriers into allowing the updates because it costs them money. The manufacturers don&#8217;t always want to do this because they want to sell new phones with the latest and greatest. Only select phones of theirs will get any updates.</p>
<p>For example, I have a T-Mobile SGS2 and have had a good experience with the ICS update, but the T-Mobile boards are full of people complaining about the update, bricking phones, calling support, trading in phones, etc.  It&#8217;s costing T-Mobile money.</p>
<p>For the business model of Android to work in the current climate, they&#8217;ve got to limit the hardware like Windows Phone or control the experience from end to end like Apple does. This isn&#8217;t going to change unless the hardware and OS software is separated like PCs and Windows are today, where the updates come directly from the OS maker and not some third party, and the carriers need to just be a data pipe. This way you&#8217;ll have hardware, OS and carrier all competing on only the pieces they own, not across all of the pieces.</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/Houseofpainsameasiteverwas.jpg" /></p>
<p>HTC has been pretty decent about updates as well as Sprint. This is a brand new update so it will take a bit of time for it to get out because of al the fragmentation and custom skins like Sense and Touch Wiz .</p>
<p>In Sprints case with all the issues surrounding the LTE rollout fiasco. The faster they rollout this update the better. They ain&#8217;t exactly wining people over with their pathetic data speeds right now.</p>
<p>The EVO 3D is still waiting for ICS, with no announced ETA. Considering that the Virgin Mobile version of the 3D is out (launched with an ICS ROM), and all the international GSM versions have gotten updated, the problem obviously lies with Sprint.</p>
<p>I wish.</p>
<p>what? Sprints awful to just like the rest of the carriers. The nexus S got ICS a month ago and the evo3d has no upgrade path in sight.</p>
<p>Nexus S 4G got ICS like 3 mnths ago and Sprint is faster than Verizon and At&amp;t, which isnt necessarily saying alot. But they are quicker.</p>
<p>I said decent, not great at updates. Big difference bro&#8230;..</p>
<p>the most exciting thing about the Android &#8220;Platform Development Kit&#8221; is that there&#8217;s going to be a shit ton of leaks from h/w partners</p>
<p>Was thinking the same thing.  There going to have a hell of a time keeping the new features a secret unless they have somehow deliver the OS with those pieces stripped out.</p>
<p>Many manufacturers are in the process of rolling out Android 4.0 to their devices like HTC. They still have to update the EVO 3D, Desire HD and many more models. I highly doubt the will be bringing Andoid 4.1 to their phones until at least November this year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious how they&#8217;re going to implement Google Now with a physical home button.  Swiping up from it really feels natural and simple.</p>
<p>My personal bet: longpress search for devices with a dedicated search button (Nexus S, i.e.), double tap on home button for the others (bye bye vlingo on S2, I suppose?).</p>
<p>Bye bye to S Voice on S3 also.</p>
<p>Swipe up from the bottom of the screen&#8230;?</p>
<p>LOL.  I just tested it out on my Nexus and you&#8217;re right, you just need to swipe from the bottom of the screen, not necessarily the home key.</p>
<p>@The Verge, I would like to retract/edit my comment.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t use Google Now. They just wasted all that time and money to build S Voice, I&#8217;m positive they will continue using it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a shame, Google Now is pretty cool.  It would also add more to the fragmention argument.</p>
<p>just go to the Google Search app.</p>
<p>Until there is an economic incentive for the OEMs and carriers, this will not change.  They don&#8217;t make any more money by updating their phones, they would rather try and sell you a new phone.</p>
<p>Exactly. See my post directly below yours. What POSSIBLE reason could HTC or Samsung have to upgrade your OS for free? They get no money, and even further, they potentially lose out on a hardware sale because you&#8217;re happy with your device, plus you get the new OS for free. Great deal for you&#8230;not so much for them.</p>
<p>Google needs to handle the updates somehow. It&#8217;s complicated, I know, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. Find a way.</p>
<p>This is why I&#8217;m hoping that Google will mandate stock Android and timely updates across all Motorola phones.</p>
<p>Unlikely. Google has already stated that they won&#8217;t intrude on Motorola&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>However, it is likely they will leverage Motorola&#8217;s use of non-Nexus hardware to help enhance the PDK.</p>
<p>That is not what Google has said about Motorola.  Google will not give privileged access to Android updates that other OEMs don&#8217;t have have.  That&#8217;s not the same as agreeing to keep spending company resources developing skins on top of Android.</p>
<p>Ah, I guess I misinterpreted their statements.</p>
<p>The OEM&#8217;s and carriers are getting a lot of neg press for being unwilling to respond to user demand for timely updates. If one of them actually took time to take care of consumers and not destroy them with bloatware, then the could actually win customers over by taking care of them.</p>
<p>ASUS is doing this for consumers and it has helped their sales and perception. The carriers are insisting we don;t have the right to put the OS of our choice on our phones, then they have an obligation to support them in a timely manner.  I&#8217;d personally be happier if they got out of the way and let us decide when we want to install the updates.</p>
<p>True, but for phones in the market now, it will make a difference.  I think a lot of people are re-evaluating whether they want a Samsung Galaxy S3 or a Galaxy Nexus because of jellybean&#8230;</p>
<p>Tech savvy people might reconsider, but the overwhelming majority of consumers wont be aware of the difference.  They will just see the GSII commercials and ads and go buy.</p>
<p>Hold on a second&#8230;.. I haven&#8217;t seen any Galaxy S 2 commercials in a long time.  I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.  Galaxy S 2?  Man, you&#8217;re a year behind. /s</p>
<p>That&#8217;s sadly very true. The vast majority of the world doesn&#8217;t know about jelly bean, Google Now, the disadvantages of skinning, update delays due to skins, bloatware, etc. All they see is a nice phone in the commercials and they run after it.</p>
<p>The Nokia guy was correct when he said &#8220;the average customer doesn&#8217;t care about updates&#8221;. It was the wrong thing to say, but he was right. And that applies to iOS, Android AND WP7.</p>
<p>Then why does MS or Apple update their phones?</p>
<p>The main problem with updates on Android isn&#8217;t the complexity of updating; it&#8217;s that the OEMs have no real reason to update the software once you&#8217;ve purchased, and especially once they&#8217;ve phased out the device you&#8217;re on. Sure, there is brand loyalty to those who will buy based on availability of updates&#8230;but in practice, most users don&#8217;t care (Verge readers excluded). It&#8217;s cheaper for the OEMs to just pretend that 18 month old tablet you&#8217;re using never existed, and move on to the next big thing.</p>
<p>Apply this scenario to the PC industry. Just think if you bought an HP desktop, and you couldn&#8217;t buy Windows 9 from Microsoft, you had to get it from HP. But your computer is 24 months old, and they stopped even selling your computer 6 months ago. What possible reason does HP have to update Windows for you? They won&#8217;t make any money off of it, and in fact, you might not buy that NEW HP computer because your old one is working just fine. From a financial perspective, this makes perfect sense, and it&#8217;s why this situation doesn&#8217;t exist on the desktop.</p>
<p>The solution needs to be Google handling the updates. I know, it&#8217;s very hard, what with all the various hardware configs out there, and the cell industry being their typical pains in our collective asses. That&#8217;s irrelevant though, the bottom line is, Google is the ONLY one that has some incentive to make these updates available to previously-purchased hardware owners. Until that happens, this will always, ALWAYS be a problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the cat is already out of the bag. The OS is open source. If Google decided that it wanted to handle all the updates tomorrow the OEMs can simply stick with the current free and open one and fork their own versions like Amazon did. Google has no power to solve this problem unless the future updates are released not to OEMs but directly to the consumer for installation on whatever hardware they might have even though I&#8217;m sure all devices will get locked down every which way possible.</p>
<p>OEMs and carriers would HATE it if Google were to start pushing out updates themselves. OEMs don&#8217;t like being dumb manufacturers; they want to have as much control over their devices as possible so the customer gets locked in to their and only THEIR devices.</p>
<p>Laptop OEMs dislike it already because MS controls updates on Windows laptops, and that&#8217;s why they ship laptops with as much bloatware as possible to &#8220;differentiate&#8221; their offering. Sadly it works out really well among the masses, I know one person who buys Dell laptops &#8220;just because the Dell dock is very good&#8221;.</p>
<p>Same goes for Sense and TouchWiz, and OEMs won&#8217;t like Google to be fiddling around with their custom modifications. OEMs want to take care of skins themselves.</p>
<p>As I see it you have two options.</p>
<p>1) Learn to like the OS version the phone came with, because in all likelihood thats the one you will be using two years later.</p>
<p>2) Vote with your wallet: buy an iPhone, Nexus-class device, or Windows Phone (I kid, I kid!) that is free from crapware and comes with a guarantee of a reasonable timeframe for software upgrades.</p>
<p>It is far too late for Google to take back control of the software update process without strong harm politics. If I recall, only 7 % of Android devices are running ICS. Compare that to 80% of iOS device running iOS 5. It is a real mess for Android developers. <br />
I don&#8217;t know how Google can manage that but if they don&#8217;t the situation can only get worst.</p>
<p>The update situation irks technical people to no end but the reality of android is the vast majority of android users don&#8217;t know and don&#8217;t care about these updates.  My wife has a droid 4 and could care less about ICS or jelly bean.  Droid 4 is a mediocre phone btw but she like the keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Couldn&#8217;t</strong> care less.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7O0MFkmpw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om7O0MFkmpw</a></p>
<p>That video is hilarious, and sadly, very, very, true.</p>
<p>When will my Samsung Galaxy S get the Jelly Bean update?<br />
You heard me right. Its just one S.<br />
I&#8217;m using a vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich now thanks to some folks in XDA<br />
People there works faster to provide update compare to what the manufacturer do.<br />
Once again. Thank You XDA Developers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s far down the road: a working ROM seems in the work (audio and signal are the most troublesome stuff by now) so wait and hope my friend :)<br />
Praised be XDA, as always.</p>
<p>wait for the source to be released. SDK ports offers usually a sub par experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s terrible that the Galaxy S, <strong>the</strong> Android phone of 2010 didn&#8217;t get ICS.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s ok, my Fassy is on ICS thanks to Team Hacksung :D</p>
<p>That is only useful for the techy &#8216;elite&#8217; like us.</p>
<p>Same as mine :D</p>
<p>I just bought a white GSM Galaxy Nexus (not directly through google), still stuck on 4.0.2. After researching it found out its a yakjuxw build. If I have to root/flash my Nexus to get Jelly Bean i&#8217;m going to pissed. It defeats half the reason why I purchased a nexus device in the first place.</p>
<p>is it unlocked?</p>
<p>yes its unlocked</p>
<p>Also had the yakjuxw build, so I will take a guess and say you live in Europe, which means samsung takes care of sending out updates :S Well, just throw a yakju build on it, and then you will get the same treatment as the one in play store (I did it immediately, when I found out that I had a yakjuxw build)</p>
<p>is it fare to say that this is a blunder from Samsung?</p>
<p>Yes indeed, I really hope that the next nexus phone doesn&#8217;t come from samsung, when that is the way they treat people who don&#8217;t buy their phones with crap skin.</p>
<p>If google wants to keep the cost down, there is no OEM with the infrastructure that could provide google with a phone that cheap. Samsungs manufacturing capability is insane. Nobody comes even close. They do everything in house. You would think Apple would be bigger but no, they get their parts from companies like Samsung and they assemble it at Foxxcon.</p>
<p>Samsung is by far the biggest electronics manufacturer on the planet and this gives them the power to produce at a very low cost.</p>
<p>Same phone by HTC will cost over $400.</p>
<p>Nice history lesson, but it still doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Samsung delays the update over a half year on galaxy nexus with yakjuxw build (still on 4.0.2). If samsungs thinks that is an okay thing to do, then I don&#8217;t really have much interest in them making the next nexus phone</p>
<p>i didn&#8217;t know about this. wtf does Google have to say about this?</p>
<p>They have their heads in the sand and pretend that there&#8217;s no Nexus variant outside the US version.  Ergo, no problem.</p>
<p>Just like the play store only got apps where I live, they don&#8217;t seems to think other lands exist except for USA, so they haven&#8217;t done anything about.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re welcome.</p>
<p>And samsung is the most developer friendly OEM that doesn&#8217;t listen to carrier bullshit and lock their bootloader.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just looking for things to complain when Samsung is clearly the best OEM partner for nexus devices.  <br />
There is no way i&#8217;m willing to pay $100 more and have a locked bootloader just to get updates 15 days earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;And samsung is the most developer friendly OEM that doesn’t listen to carrier bullshit and lock their bootloader.<br />
I don&#8217;t live in USA where they have crappy carrier, so that never affected me, no matter what carrier you have, where I live we get the update at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You’re just looking for things to complain when Samsung is clearly the best OEM partner for nexus devices. &quot;<br />
dude they have releaed ICS 4.0.4 to galaxy s2, but galaxy nexus is still on 4.0.2, even thought it is branded as the best updated android device, my complains are relevant.</p>
<p>&#8220;15 days earlier.&#8221;<br />
15 days later wouldn&#8217;t be a problem but half a year is!</p>
<p>another thing the bootloader is locked on galaxy nexus, but it is easy to unlock so I have changed to yakju build, since I don&#8217;t when to deal with samsungs crap.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re on .0.2 because i bought the unlocked nexus and it updated to 4.0.4 not even 5 mins after using it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t live in USA, the version we can buy in Europe has an yakjuxw build, which mean SAMSUNG are the one that provide the updates.</p>
<p>And just to make it clear<br />
YOU HAVE A GALAXU NEXUS WITH YAKJU BUILD, WHILE I HAVE ONE WITH A YAKJUXW BUILD, THAT MEANS I DON&#8217;T GET MY UPDATE DIRECTLY FROM GOOGLE.</p>
<p>I was on Yakdjuv (or something like it). I am really not into rooting and romming but I followed the instructions on XDA on how to change over to Yakju. Super easy, worked no problems. Give it a go. Can&#8217;t wait for July ;)</p>
<p>If you move op to the start of this thread of comment, you will see I already have done that, but it really shouldn&#8217;t be necessary for a nexus product, and it affects people who are afraid of rooming</p>
<p>Cool and totally agree.</p>
<p>Well, we will see. There is a rumor that the 5.0 update will come with 5 Nexus devices instead of one, all from different OEM&#8217;s. I assume they will come from HTC, Samsung, Sony, Motorola, and maybe a wildcard like Huwei, Asus, or ZTE.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the States, ordered it through expansys. It had 4.0.1 and I received an OTA update to 4.0.2.</p>
<p>I ordered it through Google play. Got 4.0.4 as soon as i turned it on. You should manually check for updates.</p>
<p>I tried that and also the Framework clear trick. No updates found.</p>
<p>Try using this app and tell us what build you are on.<br />

<p>I tried using that and get this message on the link &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weird, well here is a link to the apk then<br />
<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4246219/GNOfficialUpdate.apk" target="_blank">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4246219/GNOfficialUpdate.apk</a></p>
<p>Thanks! Like I said above its a yakjuxw, and it says its not updated by google</p>
<p>Considering you are in the state I&#8217;m surprised you got the one where Samsung send out the update. Maybe Samsung will send out JB faster, but I just went and throw the yakju build from google on my phone to be safe.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was debating on doing that on the weekend, but I literally got the phone last week. It has a year warranty on it and I know if I unlock the bootloader and root the phone it&#8217;ll void the warranty so im really trying not to do it.</p>
<p>Actually you don&#8217;t root the phone you just unlock the bootloader and trow a yakju build on it. After you have done that, you can still lock the bootloader and your warranty will still be in check (there is no need to root). But if you only have  had it for a week, then it might be worth just waiting to see if google will push JB to yakjuxw build. Since they just have delayed small update it don&#8217;t get much attention in the media, but if they delay JB, then it would be much worse.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to wait but if it starts to goes more than a month without JB after release i&#8217;m going to have to switch the build to yakju.</p>
<p>Just received the 4.0.4 update today. I hope JB update comes faster!</p>
<p>I have the same issue&#8230;I bought a galaxy nexus and found it was a HK import and the updates are via Samsung.  I finally got the 4.04 update this weekend&#8230;3 months after it was released.  I think I&#8217;m going to have to root and flash, which is slightly daunting.  Is there is an easy way for me to make the phone into the standard GSM build?</p>
<p>if you find out a way, please let me know. I really don&#8217;t want to root and flash either.</p>
<p>I bought through Negri Electronics and found I had yakjuxw.  I changed it just last week using the instructions in a thread on xda. <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1626895" target="new"></a><br />
I do not have a lot of experiencing messing with Android, but these instructions did the trick pretty easily.  It requires that you flash but not that you root.  It only became difficult when I accidentally skippped a step, otherwise I wouldn&#8217;t have had any issues.<br />
(My link does not show in the preview, so I&#8217;m pasting again here <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1626895" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1626895</a> )</p>
<p>Exactly the same for me. Just did this last week, followed every step and it worked no problems. I put up with the buggy, battery ruining 4.01 for 3 months. Now on 4.04. Wish I&#8217;d changed over straight away.</p>
<blockquote>Consider this: the Droid RAZR was announced on the same day as the Galaxy Nexus. Eight months later, the Android 4.0 update for the RAZR was released in the same week that Google announced Android 4.1.</blockquote>
<p>This quote from the article really highlights how much of an issue this is and how much it needs some serious attention from all concerned.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even entirely sure that the 4.0 update is available everywhere yet. The RAZR ICS update appears to be indefinitely delayed here in Sweden.</p>
<p>Good work, Google. Way to set an example for other OEMs.</p>
<p>we are talking about a vzw device also&#8230; which only makes things significantly worse.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a problem, but with the new PDK it should be a lot easier for devs to keep updating relatively recent phones (i.e. within the last year) to the latest OS.</p>
<p>Even Apple and MS aren&#8217;t going to put their latest and greatest on phones outside of a year or two now (or severely cripple what they do get).</p>
<p>Apple is upgrading the 3-year-old 3GS&#8230;</p>
<p>But not Siri.  The 4 doesn&#8217;te get it either.  So it&#8217;s not a full upgrade.  I find that when you&#8217;re able to upgrade your Android phone, you get the full benefits of the new version.</p>
<p>if you care about updates and you dont buy a nexus device in the google ecosystem (or you aren&#8217;t happy and willing to throw a ROM on your phone), then at this point its hard to complain. Its a known bad situation for Android, but there is an easy way to get around it. H</p>
<p>i hate trackpads.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230; hopefully with the rumor of a nexus device from more then 1 manufacturer this fall it will give people more options and designs to choose from for a nexus phone instead of just 1 every year. Although as long as you are using terrible CDMA you are going to be beholden to Verizon for your horrible OS experience.</p>
<p>Wait a minute. I thought android was about choice. How is this choice when people say you should only get a necys device. And that&#8217;s only if you buy it from the play store, if you get it from a carrier you are SOL</p>
<p>which option comes bargain</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>"Get this phone or get a crap long term experience" isn’t really choice.</p>
<p>sure it is, some people really don&#8217;t care as long as is has apps.  the price also creates choice.</p>
<p>Apps like Chrome? Only available for the 7.8% on ICS.</p>
<p>you think people know or care? They push the Browser button and it works.</p>
<p>Chrome is an example, as time goes on devs will have to start targeting 4.0+ to start enjoying the APIs and not limiting themselves to 2.3.</p>
<p>Those people would also be fine with a free 3GS, the choice argument doesn&#8217;t make sense here.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even think &#8216;Apps&#8217; matter to a lot of users. I think a lot of smartphone users, especially recent newcomers are more feature phone users who have been up-sold or offered a free upgrade to get them to signs data contract.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll probably never open the browser, let alone download an App.</p>
<p>the assumption is that there is going to be several Nexi. Besides there are custom roms and some manufacturers (HTC, Asus&#8230;) do the job pretty fast.</p>
<p>What bug and security updates. Do roms fix that.</p>
<p>Google needs to stop caving in to these carriers because they just worry about marketshare. Steve jobs would of told these carriers to kiss my ass. Dont do shit to these phones but just provide the network signal. Nexus was all about timely updates, but it wasn&#8217;t until after the necys was sold on Verizon google said they won&#8217;t be rolling out the CDMA updates for nexus devices themselves anymore&#8230;WHAT!!! If apple can do it then so can google</p>
<p>differentiation is a big part of their selling point to carriers and OEMs. They won&#8217;t do it that way.</p>
<p>There is a difference, popular device, plenty of commercials, and free adv by celebrities, so yes Apple can tell the carriers to kiss *ss. You know how Verizon being pushing LTE, and refuses to sell anymore new 3G? What would happen if Apple decided to release the next device only in 3G favors? I willing to bet Verizon would eat its words. Having said that, problem with Nexus devices are too many,  besides techs no one knows or care about them; carriers control, see google wallet; needs a name change, yes Americans love good sounding , unscientific names; more ads, needs to be in the hands of D. Jeter,  L. James etc; keep it simple stupid, OS somehow needs to retain one name, all these dessert  names not cutting for the nontechnical dude, and I can go on and on. Let illustrate an example, I&#8217;ve never been to a Tmobile store before, so the other  day wanted to check out the S2 and S3, asked the clerk  if the  S2 was running  ICS, they had no clue, they simply stated, both running Andriod OS. Anyway, hopefully you guys get my point. It&#8217;s an uphill battle, unless things don&#8217;t start to change.</p>
<p>Yes customs rom are done to fix bugs. Hating the carriers is lame : you have to understand how hard their job  actually is.</p>
<p>i didn&#8217;t say it was a good choice. Its the sad situation Android has found itself in. There is no incentive for manufacturers to spend time on timely updates that require extensive rework.</p>
<p>The choice is, you can get Nexus device and get upgrades the fastest, or get a different device and play the waiting game. Its not a great choice, but its what is there now.</p>
<p>Obviously 95%+ of people who own these devices don&#8217;t care or know what version of software they are running</p>
<blockquote>MICROSOFT HAS AT LEAST IT USERS GIVEN CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT</blockquote>
<p>This statement was downright stupid. The rest of the article is interesting but I&#8217;m more optimistic : entreprise give what consumer want and if they don&#8217;t they fail&#8230;</p>
<p>Why is it stupid, it is completely true.</p>
<p>It is terrible MS aren&#8217;t upgrading current devices to WP8 but at least they&#8217;re being upfront about it. WP8 for new phones and WP8 &#8216;lite&#8217; (7.8) for current devices.</p>
<p>Because don&#8217;t upgrading any phone is worst than upgrading some of them.</p>
<p>That is in no way a sentence.</p>
<p>sorry English is not my primary language. Should I ve said &#8220;Because not upgrading &#8230;&#8221; ?</p>
<p>And by the way that is in no way a proper response^^</p>
<p>His response was insensitive. You&#8217;re looking for &#8220;Because not* upgrading any phones* is worse* than upgrading some of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>worse: compares one thing to another<br />
worst: compares one thing to many (2+)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>I agree, upgrading none is worse than upgrading some. But 2 wrongs don&#8217;t make a right.</p>
<p>What makes you say WP7.8 is just WP8 &#8216;lite&#8217; ?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a start screen&#8230;</p>
<p>or not ? We don&#8217;t know yet. So it&#8217;s not clear nor &#8220;unambiguous&#8221; which makes the statement false and by extension, stupid.</p>
<p>I call it WP8 &#8216;lite&#8217; becuase it is getting some of the user facing features.</p>
<p>The specifics of WP7.8 are not known but that is still a hell of a a lot clearer a path to the users than &#8220;no comment&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re changing the subject by comparing it with Android.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re only talking about how the statement is false (and you saying that it is, in fact, true).</p>
<p>If you were a Windows Phone user, would you be satisfied with this kind of answer: &#8220;We&#8217;re screwing you, that&#8217;s for sure. But we can&#8217;t say how deep right now&#8221; ?</p>
<p>And would you consider such an answer &#8220;clear&#8221; and &#8220;unambiguous&#8221; ?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re clearly and unambiguously getting screwed.  The only real question is which orifice and thus how much it will hurt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really clever, ass-wipe. Want a medal ?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible not to compare it to the other choices.</p>
<p>If I was a WP user I would say &#8220;we need to know more but at least they&#8217;re being up front about the situation&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fact that &#8220;we need to know more&#8221; means that it is <strong>NOT</strong> unambiguous or clear. Is simple English really that difficult ?</p>
<blockquote>However, Microsoft has at least given its users clear and unambiguous guidance about what to expect.</blockquote>
<p>You really think that ? We still know nothing about WP7.8. Whether it&#8217;ll be just a new start screen or not. They haven&#8217;t said much and frankly I don&#8217;t think they care. After keeping us in the dark just so they could sell outdated smartphones, Microsoft is really the worst example here.</p>
<p>For most of the non-techies I know this is the exact opposite of a problem. They get a phone, they get it set up the way they like, the last thing on Earth they want is an OS update to come along and change everything on them. They&#8217;re willing to re-learn things in two years when they buy a new phone, but right now? Not an issue for any but the tech obsessed.</p>
<p>EXACTLY&#8230;. if you are here on The Verge, you are 1% of the tech consuming public and should be buying only NEXUS.  The rest of the skinned &#8220;Android&#8221; phones (I use quotes because I don&#8217;t even see those as Android really) are bought by everyone else, mostly not reading this post.</p>
<p>Compare that argument though with the one that Android offers choice.  Sure it does offer choice, but you&#8217;d better make the singular choice of this year&#8217;s Nexus phone if you want timely software updates.  Awaiting my Nexus 7, at least I can expect 2 major updates for it.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll care when they can&#8217;t run an app because they&#8217;re outdated (such as chrome)</p>
<p>it is pretty much only tech people that care about running chrome on the phone.</p>
<p>Chrome is just an example, as time goes on devs will have to start targeting 4.0+ to start enjoying the APIs and not limiting themselves to 2.3.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t chrome skyrocket to the number one download for iOS the day it was released with well over a million downloads? If iOS users are caring I think that Android users might actually care as well.</p>
<p>well over a million downloads?  are you sure? that sounds like a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>No I am not certain. I just recall it was all over the tech news, the next day about it it instantly became the number one iOS download. I don&#8217;t have my iPad with me at work to see if it shows. that metric like it does in Android.<br />
I was surprised.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is true anymore. Chrome is the most used browser on computers and people like to have it on their smartphones: the succes of Chrome for iOS demonstrates this. Non tech people will be disappointed when they can&#8217;t have Chrome on their phone but their friends have it on theirs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my HTC Rezound still hasn&#8217;t gotten its ICS update. Oy. I just bought an Asus Transformer TF300 arriving later this week (I like the 10&quot; form, HDMI out and expansion slot- sorry, Nexus 7). Asus&#8217; has a slightly better-than-average track record at these updates, but on the other hand, it&#8217;s a product they&#8217;re phasing out of stores&#8230;so I&#8217;m not sure how much I hope for the Jelly Bean update.</p>
<p>HTC doesn&#8217;t care about customer loyalty, otherwise they would be better about releasing updates.  People are not loyal to Sense, they tolerate it.  The EVO View 4G (aka HTC Flyer) is reported to not receive anymore updates , yet Sprint has a 2 year contract and it&#8217;s only about a year old.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t think ahead about the HTC EVO LTE either, and after using it for a month, I can easily say that it is barely any better than my 2 year old Evo 4G.  This shows how little progress HTC has made in the past 2 years because they were too busy pumping out CRAP.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really simple.  If you want real Android updates in a timely manner, and you are a fan of Android and Google, ONLY EVER BUY NEXUS.  If your carrier has no Nexus, tough&#8230;. get an iPhone.  If you go out and buy a Samsung or HTC or whatever, which is skinned, DO NOT COMPLAIN.  Google will not help you.  Those companies are not in it to provide lasting customer support.  And it&#8217;s really a mess with the carriers on the carrier branded phones.  Verizon or ATT will point the finger at the OEM, the OEM will point the finger at the carrier.  Just forget it.  All the skinned phones are for the regular average Joe Shmo Smartphone buyer.  Not the for the tech savvy.  If you are on this forum, you should probably be only buying NEXUS.   This is a market force.  If everyone were to only seek out Nexus phones (which would not happen), then all the OEMs would start to lose money and would have to start offering vanilla Android.  This doesn&#8217;t happen because most of the Android buyers don&#8217;t know what they are buying (they are no different than iPhone buyers, most people are not tech savvy).</p>
<blockquote>most of the Android buyers don’t know what they are buying (they are no different than iPhone buyers, most people are not tech savvy).</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d wager than many more iPhone users are more aware of what they&#8217;re buying than Android users are.</p>
<p>Yes, most consumers aren&#8217;t tech savvy, but Android doesn&#8217;t have the reputation that iPhones have.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d agree there. People say iPhones are for the non tech savvy people but I&#8217;d say beyond nerds like us (on both platforms) the average iPhone user is more aware of what their device is than an Android user.</p>
<p>This is of course, completely anecdotal and just based off what I have observed.</p>
<p>geeks not nerds.</p>
<p>What the hell is the difference? And which do you mean has which?</p>
<p>The main difference is that these guys were geeks, but not nerds</p>

<p>+1<br />
You either get an HTC/Sammy or updates. You chose it buying your phone.</p>
<p>Well either Nexus or be prepared to root and run a custom ROM which is stock Android which works pretty well. I&#8217;ll be a Nexus user unless the hardware is awful but generally that hasn&#8217;t been the case so far and I don&#8217;t expect it to be. I just hope the next Nexus phone has sd card support.</p>
<p>I should buy Nexus?</p>
<p>Great!</p>
<p>Are you in the USA?</p>
<p>If so would you mind terribly buying one for me from the Google Play store and shipping it to me over in northern Europe because the Nexus on sale in stores here isn&#8217;t a Google Galaxy Nexus, it&#8217;s a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and as it turns out it doesn&#8217;t get updates from Google because that&#8217;s being handled by Samsung. The Samsung way. Which is to say not at all.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus on the Play Store is the EXACT same Nexus thats sold in Europe.</p>
<p>Except one is updated by Google and the other one is supposed to be updated by Samsung. The support is different. The software build is different.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The CDMA ones are updated by carriers.</p>
<p>The GSM ones are updated by Google with help of Samsung.</p>
<p>Sorry to say, but you&#8217;re wrong, google &#8220;yakjuxw&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the hardware seems to be the same, so you can just flash yakju on those phones and get updates from Google.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the hardware seems to be the same, so you can flash yakju on them and then you get fast updates.</p>
<p>Like I said before, if people say you should only get a necys if you want timely updates then in my mind THAT&#8217;S NOT CHOICE. That&#8217;s forcing people to get one model over another for just timely updates. Most people don&#8217;t care about updates until they get them. Same goes for ios users. They can careless but when the update come to iOS devices they get excited because it does new things.  Jelly beam got a lot of things right and to say users don&#8217;t care about updates is a cop out statement. If that&#8217;s the case then what&#8217;s the point of googke creat new os versions</p>
<p>This is why I am a convert to Nexus devices since the Galaxy Nexus. I have been an android user since the HTC Hero but before ICS the stock UI was ugly so didn&#8217;t mind things like Sense.</p>
<p>Since ICS though I&#8217;m all about Nexus devices. Can&#8217;t wait to get rid if my Xoom in favour of the N7 as it&#8217;s both a Nexus device and I love the form factor</p>
<p>The US Wifi Xoom is a Nexus device in it&#8217;s own right; it gets updates from Google. But yeah, as a full device Nexus 7 is better.</p>
<p>Sure but only the US Xoom. Until a few weeks ago no Xoom outside of the US received even ICS. JB is a dream.</p>
<p>A lot of people here are damn wrong saying &#8220;Samsung makes no money updating their phones&#8221;. Why do techies buy Nexus series? They do it because they <strong>expect</strong> updates. Its expectation that drives demand. What can Samsung do to sell more SGSIII? Create the same expectation.<br />
The thing is obviously that the market works that way: you&#8217;re better off skinning Android than you are updating it faster. Why? It&#8217;s prolly carriers&#8217; demands and differentiation.</p>
<p>because a very slim minority of users care about what version they are running. Until there is high demand for a Nexus device its going to stay the same way. People on this site dont constitute enough high demand</p>
<p>As a comment above indicated most people not only don&#8217;t care about updates, they hate everything breaking.</p>
<p>I have faith that the PDK will reduce wait times by a few months, but it&#8217;s still not going to be an ideal situation. 8 months &#8594; 5 months is still an unnecessarily long wait.</p>
<p>In order to get timely updates, everybody needs to be running stock Android. In order for that to happen, people need to start demanding stock Android. In order for that to happen, people need to be aware of the awesome features in new versions of Android (Google Now is one of these features). And finally, in order for that to happen, people need to understand that Android is an operating system, and that it runs on a variety of phones.</p>
<p>If Google can build some brand recognition and loyalty for Android then this will begin to happen. We all know the statistics. Roughly 50% of users are running Android. If Google starts running Android ads (like they do with Chrome) 50% of people who see them are going to realise that this is what powers their phone. And if the ads are touting new features such as Google Now, then those 50% are going to start wondering why they don&#8217;t have this on their phones. This is what&#8217;s going to make users demand new features. Apple&#8217;s done an absolutely amazing job of this with Siri. Google Now is (in my opinion) better than Siri, and Google should be pushing it as hard as they can.</p>
<p>When Nexus devices sell more than skinned devices, the carriers and OEMs will take notice. Until then they really couldn&#8217;t care less what the 1% (nerds, tech forum members and media say).</p>
<p>5 months is how long it takes Apple to release a new update after announcing it. June-October. Why would 5 months be bad for Android? GSM Nexus devices get updates well within 5 months, so they are arguably better updated that iPhone.</p>
<p>I just received Ice Cream Sandwich as of last weekend.  Why does this article force me to feel like I should ship myself and my phone in a box back to manufacturer just because I&#8217;m not running the latest and greatest?</p>
<p><img src="http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a222/Zerru/sloth_in_a_box.jpg" /></p>
<p>probably because that is what Apple has led them to believe.</p>
<p>Actually because historically we have been able to buy a computer and upgrade it at our discretion.  The carriers and OEM&#8217;s swore we couldn&#8217;t handle that sort of power and that the network was to fragile to be trusted to non blessed OS&#8217;s .</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t Apple pushing this it is an assumed right that still doesn&#8217;t make sense to many consumers.  If people could upgrade when they wanted to then this wouldn&#8217;t be an issue whatsoever.</p>
<p>Or because pretty much every other major platform has worked like that.</p>
<p>Windows, all compatible machines can upgrade day 1. Linux, OS X&#8230;</p>
<p>I have ordered a Galaxy 3 (1GB version) and hear people complaining about running out of memory as it is.  If jellybean takes more then its hardly future proof at all.  Not good for a £499 device!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very tempted to cancel my order now&#8230;</p>
<p>Its not running out of memory, do not trust task killers.</p>
<p>Are people still using task killers?  Some of the threads I have read on XDA are about touchwiz reloading after exiting the browser.  That suggests low memory.</p>
<p>I so wish we, as a community, could stop using the word &#8220;buttery&#8221; to describe the (usually very subjective) perception of smoothness or responsiveness.</p>
<p>Ice Cream Sandwich is already "buttery," so we need something else to describe Jelly Bean. What is more buttery than butter?</p>
<p><img src="http://positivelynatalie.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/1915engrish-this-is-unbelieveable-this-not-butter2.jpg" /></p>
<p>LawL! Such is the fate of the Android.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad to say, but from the perspective of someone like HTC or Samsung, getting out timely updates in seriously irrelevant. What percent of Android users in the world know that 4.1 exists? Or know what version of Android their phone is running on? Or hell, know that their phone gets updates at all? I&#8217;d say at least 80%. Now, why the hec would HTC or Samsung bust their balls to satisfy the 10% who know what 4.1 is?</p>
<p>I guess what I meant to say is that around 10% know all the specifics about their phone.</p>
<p>Even if the market starts coming out with stock Android phones, it still won&#8217;t get direct updates from Google. It is the responsibility of the OEMs to get the source code and test the individual phones and release the new version. The only thing that would be removed is skinning. All the phones would still have to be tested individually, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Yes but you&#8217;d have a situation more like Microsoft Windows.  PC hardware isn&#8217;t all the same, but it&#8217;s the &#8220;same enough&#8221; that a single shrinkwrapped copy of Windows can run on anything, plus maybe a driver tweak or 2 from the manufacturer.</p>
<blockquote>Microsoft has at least it users given clear and unambiguous guidance about what to expect</blockquote>
<p>Really? You&#8217;re comparing an ecosystem consisting of <strong>one</strong> hardware platform with Android, in an attempt to take a swipe at Android?</p>
<p>There are still NEW Android phones being shipped with Android 2.3. That should say something.</p>
<p>Google needs to seriously ban OS skinning.</p>
<p>If they did that, then the oems will most likely do the same thing as amazon :S</p>
<p>Can someone please help me with restoring the Nandroid image on RootzWiki of 4.1 JellyBean preview for Galaxy Nexus GSM? I get a failed MD5 checksum every time.  It&#8217;s missing 2 of the files listed in the MD5 but I&#8217;ve tried to edit the MD5 in 3 diff apps to lose those 2 missing ones and still fail.  How are people getting this restored with Clockwork Mod Recovery? Would welcome any help..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the Verizon one, but by now there should have a regular flashable zip instead of a nandroid backup image. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d look for anyway.</p>
<p>We change phones at least every 2 years, it&#8217;s really not that big of a deal for the average user. Apple has exactly the same problem by continually eliminating features from upgrades in older phones yet no one seems fussed.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Apple are giving users the best case scenario: delivering an update to older phones. Maybe the update doesn&#8217;t bring every feature, but it&#8217;s an update nonetheless. If you want an Android device that is sure to get the latest update, buy a Nexus-branded phone.</p>
<p>In the distant future we would look back on these days and call them the Dark Ages of Android.</p>
<p>Android will eventually take over us, this will be the cute ages of Android.</p>
<p>i already look back at Froyo, with having to manage apps to your SD card because phones had 50mb of app space to install as the &#8220;Dark Ages of Android&#8221;</p>
<p>So maybe we&#8217;re leaving the Dark Age and entering into the Era of Insufficient Light?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting a fully featured version of Android ICS (expecting Jelly Bean too) on my Galaxy Ace. Thanks to <a href="http://maclaw.pl/" target="_blank">Maclaw </a>and his team on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1490867" target="_blank">XDA</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.galaxyics.com" target="_blank" style="margin: 2px 0 30px 190px;">Galaxy ICS (Galaxy Ace)</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.galaxyics.com" target="_blank" style="margin: 2px 0 30px 190px;"></a><p /></p>
<p>So much for ICS killing fragmentation&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the PDK will make updates come sooner to existing phones, though it would be nice.  I hope though the PDK helps curtail the number of phones that launch with an old version of the OS months after a new version of android has dropped.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#8217;m not saying that the Android updating thing is anything but broken, but seeing as how this update was announced last week, maybe, <strong>just maybe</strong>, we should give them some time to at least test it&#8217;s capabilities on their hardware.<strong> Of course</strong> they have no comment right now. They know if they promise the moon and don&#8217;t deliver you&#8217;ll give them bad press, but if they say they can&#8217;t update certain devices, you&#8217;ll give them bad press. What are they supposed to say, when they have had no chance to even find out yet where their current hardware stands.</p>
<p>That said, I do think Google should maintain a harder grasp on this situation. REQUIRE them to fulfill more reasonable upgrade policies, or they don&#8217;t get Google services. The guidelines are too lenient, considering the manufacturers already have your money, and the telco&#8217;s are convinced, mostly because no one has told them otherwise, that Ma Bell is still alive and kicking, so they don&#8217;t need to care about our crap.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t understand why you would not get a flagship Google device if you genuinely like Android and are interested in the latest releases.  Why subject yourself to inferior hardware, silly bloatware and network banners written across the top?</p>
<p>The Nexus line does not necessarily give you the best hardware. Flagship devices from other OEMs can have superior hardware, depending on which types of hardware (screens, microSD slots, etc) are most important to you.</p>
<p>samsung likes to talk cocks<br />
their flagship galaxy note is not even ICS yet</p>
<p>ICS is out in a lot of places. I remember cussing silently when I saw the tweets about how ICS was released in (I must assume booming markets such as) Iran and Afghanistan before many other places. When I finally got the update, I was happy. However, that changed very quickly as I started to use the device. The Samsung Galaxy Note (International, N7000) ICS update is a trainwreck. It feels more responsive, but it crashes constantly. I went over to XDA to find out about the possibilies of custom roms. And this is when my head exploded, because it appears the Samsung ICS firmware update has triggered a bug in the Galaxy Note hardware that makes it extremely likely to brick the device if I begin flashing. As far as I know, there is currently no safe way to downgrade it to Gingerbread. Also, the brick is also likely to occur with the standard &#8216;reset firmware&#8217; option in Android, so Samsung are essentially selling timebombs. I&#8217;m not sure if there has been any clear statements from Samsung regarding this, but I really consider it the epitomy of corporate cynicism.</p>
<p>Until Google changes their model they have absolutely no leverage over manufacturers to update phones.  As long as consumers continue purchasing products from companies with spotty upgrade history there is no reason to change.</p>
<p>I would honestly still take Androids upgrade policy over that of Apple or Microsoft.</p>
<p>Apple releases gimped updates, with features removed for no reason. IE. No turn by turn for the iPhone 4 in iOS 6, even though it&#8217;s more than capable. They remove features from older devices to urge you into buying their latest device, no matter how little of an upgrade it is.</p>
<p>Microsoft, who&#8217;s so called flagship Nokia Lumia, a fairly recent and new device, will not receive the WP8 update, despite again, being more than capable, they&#8217;re going with a similar update policy to Apple.</p>
<p>Now on the Android side of things, I have the option to install a custom AOSP ROM to update. This is where Android will always win over the other ecosystems, developer support.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t iPhone JailBreakers be able to run the fuller featured Maps App? They usually work around most things.</p>
<p>The Lumia 900 is receiving an update though, which is more than you can say for many Android devices that will be stuck on 2.3 for eternity. And we don&#8217;t yet know what all is included in 7.8, so to speculate anything about the update wouldn&#8217;t be wise.</p>
<p>Yeah, a flagship device is receiving an update 3 months into its lifespan. Awesome. And it won&#8217;t receive any updates afterwards. The Nexus S, released in December 2010, will receive Jelly Bean a year and a half after release.</p>
<p>The update won&#8217;t come until later this year and Microsoft and Nokia has said that there will be more updates from Nokia to it&#8217;s Lumia line well after 7.8. Perhaps you should check your facts, sir.</p>
<p>7.8 is the last major update it will get, because anything past WP8 will require new hardware. And where has Microsoft/Nokia confirmed Lumias getting anything past 7.8?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say there would be another major update past 7.8. I said Nokia and Microsoft have confirmed they will continue to provide updates for the Lumia line. I believe it was in an article on WMPoweruser.com last week. You&#8217;ll need to do your own homework though.</p>
<p>After 7.8, there cannot be any major upgrades for the Lumia. And this is Microsoft&#8217;s flagship that was released 3 months ago. Minor updates, sure, but even a low-end Android phone gets a couple of those. I took a glance at WMPoweruser, and Greg Sullivan confirmed that 7.8 will be bringing the &#8220;look and feel of WP8&#8221; to WP7 devices. So no other functionality other than UX changes.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the <em>Galaxy S</em> a far more popular device (released slightly earlier in the same year) didn&#8217;t even get ICS.</p>
<p>That phone was <em>the</em> Android phone of 2010.</p>
<p>Yup, goes to show that Samsung screwed over Galaxy S users. However, it did get updated to Gingerbread, which was released 6+ months after launch. Even that is more update support than the Lumia is getting.</p>
<blockquote>Even that is more update support than the Lumia is getting.</blockquote>
<p>Which is true. But 2 wrongs don&#8217;t make a right.</p>
<p>Sure. The true test will be to see if the GSII gets JB. It&#8217;ll show that Samsung has learned from their mistakes, and the GSII definitely has the hardware to support JB.</p>
<p>I think the GS2 will prolly get JB.</p>
<p>Likely the international variant, but I&#8217;m not so sure about the American models.</p>
<p>Well, the American models are &#8220;the American models&#8221;.</p>
<p>2 Wongs do make a White, though.</p>
<p>So Apple removes features to &#8220;urge&#8221; you to upgrade&#8230; Yet Android OEMs that offer no features at all are not urging you to upgrade? Are you serious? :)</p>
<p>Explain why Apple wouldn&#8217;t just offer no updates at all if that&#8217;s their plan?  And not every upgrade that they offer is necessary for the platform as a whole (like say iMessage).  It doesn&#8217;t help Apple that iPhone 4 users get offline reading list, does it?</p>
<blockquote>I have the option to install a custom AOSP ROM to update.</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d compare that to jailbreaking, which opens up iOS features.</p>
<p>I disagree that it is a broken system. I guess the mobile software space is considered different from the desktop or laptop software space for some reason, but I don&#8217;t get this immediate demand for the newest android software. If you bought a laptop that came with Windows 7, would you demand that the laptop manufacturer upgraded you to Windows 8 for free when that is released? Kinda the same thing, at least in my mind. Only real difference is that most android phones are locked and cannot be manually updated to the latest software by the consumer easily.</p>
<p>You make a reasonable argument. However, I think it is broken when you have a networked device surfing the internet that cannot get bug fixes. That may be okay for a toaster, but not a smartphone which is exposed to hacks. In my opinion, not getting big fixes in minor updates is even worse than not getting features in major updates.</p>
<p>windows is very different. You get constant and regular updates to the software. The base software is fully featured that really doesn&#8217;t require much, if any extention.</p>
<p>Even MS&#8217;s base applications get regular updates.</p>
<p>Noone expects a free upgrade to win 8 because those are two different and separate OSes even though they are windows branded. Also, Windows is sold separately so you can do your own upgrade.</p>
<p>If Google sold each new version of android for, say $15, I&#8217;m pretty sure people would be more than willing to upgrade, but they don&#8217;t so we have to rely on them to give us the update.</p>
<p>Also, the nature of the 2 are quite different. Much of the changes in Android updates are bug fixes and performance upgrades with new skins. If you remove the version numbering from android, these would really be th eequivilent of software patches and fixes and occassional performance updates. You don&#8217;t get charged for those in Windows (even large multi gig service packs are free on Windows.</p>
<p>Updates are nice but honestly people need to stop making as big a deal about them as they do. Be comfortable with the phone you&#8217;re buying. If you don&#8217;t like the feature set it has now why are you buying it hoping it will be made better in a few months?</p>
<p>The update situation is one of the reasons I simply cannot recommend Android devices to friends and family. My brother bought a Droid RAZR Maxx when it first came out and just yesterday was able to install 4.0, a year after it&#8217;s announcement. He&#8217;s obviously frustrated and plans to go Windows Phone this Fall when WinPho8 devices are available.</p>
<p>Not Android&#8217;s fault he bought the wrong device.</p>
<p>I never said anything about it being Android (Google&#8217;s) fault. It&#8217;s the carriers and OEMs that are the problem with the update situation for Android. The problem is that the Android brand suffers because of this.</p>
<p>Droid RAZR users were told that they would get the update in a timely fashion. This has not been timely.</p>
<p>Horrible logic.</p>
<p>This is why &#8212; if I ever get an Android device &#8212; I would only get an vanilla Nexus device.</p>
<p><em>Jelly Bean itself certainly doesn&#8217;t require that much RAM (The Galaxy Nexus has just 1GB and feels &#8220;buttery&#8221;), but it&#8217;s quite possible that adding TouchWiz on top of Android 4.1 could.</em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a splendid idea, Samsung; how about leaving off TouchWiz, along with all the other crap applications, and just focus on making great hardware (which you do)?</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t want to be commoditized, which is so weird&#8230; because TouchWiz is so freaking boring as a skin. It&#8217;s mind boggling what these companies think is their &#8216;good stuff&#8217;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really sure why such a lengthy article was written on this topic. None of this information is new or surprising AT ALL. If you want the latest version of Android on your phone, then you stick to clean devices like the Nexus line of phones. If you don&#8217;t, then yah, it&#8217;s the WAIT AND SEE approach. Even though Google did make the claim about the 18 month support window, it can&#8217;t possibly enforce that. OEMs are the ones always to blame in this department, NOT GOOGLE. If you purchase a phone with HTC Sense, Samsung TouchWiz or any of the other overlays for the different models of handsets then bottom line; expect delays. To me this isn&#8217;t a big issue because the consumer always has the choice in buying a Nexus device. Once you stick to just that ecosystem of devices you suddenly realize that the way Google controls the software on those devices is very similar to how Apple does it, and they only have to worry about a few devices, not the countless other ones that OTHER OEMs continually ATTEMPT to make different with their HORRIBLE overlays.</p>
<p>not sure what you&#8217;re smoking but google is just as much to blame. they don&#8217;t have clear policies and guidlines in place to allow timely updates.</p>
<p>You guys slam MS but frankly the WP updates have been a lot more forthcoming than on Android. Even the last big update to 7.5 went smoothly and for all phones. They gave the carriers 1 month to update. If they didn&#8217;t MS would bypass them entirely and send out updates for everyone; which they did.</p>
<p>My carrier didn&#8217;t issue an update to 7.5 but MS pushed it to me anyway. Even transitioning to wp8, wp7 will still get at least some updates. How many years now i&#8217;ve been waiting for even a single update to my android devices that just never came.</p>
<p>When will hardware manufacturers realize we don&#8217;t want them meddling with our software? Every Android skin I&#8217;ve seen is laaaaame, with the exception of Sense, but I still much prefer stock Android. Honestly maybe if we used our only voice (purchases) and only purchased devices with stock Android, they would get the hint and cut the crap.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back and examine what the <em>average</em> customer is looking for in a smartphone. They include:<br />
Ease of use, screen size, perceived availability of third party apps, first party apps (GMail, Maps, Siri, etc), customization, etc. Do new Android versions drastically change any of these?</p>
<p>Android is a mass market phone OS sold to millions of people across a variety of different carriers and phones. How many people know what OS they are on? Further, how many people know what specific features the next Android OS offers (or what features they have that the previous OS did not have)? At least with Apple&#8217;s iOS iterations, the company advertises pretty clearly what they are adding and subtracting (maybe because they have more functionality to add that they purposely left out, but that is another issue).</p>
<p>Very few people care about getting a &#8220;Nexus&#8221; device so they can have the latest OS. I have seen plenty of Droid RAZRs in the real world. A friend let me play around with her RAZR extensively, it looks like a cool phone. When the average user doesn&#8217;t really know the different between Android OS versions or skins, why would he or she choose a Nexus over a RAZR when the Verizon associate is pushing RAZRs?</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is having access to the latest OS really isn&#8217;t a big drawback for most users. Given the way the US market is priced, these are not computers &#8211; smartphones (for better and for worse) have become relatively cheap, disposable technology that is best replaced very 18 months to 2 years. These aren&#8217;t laptops and desktops that you aim to keep for four years. Get rid of carrier subsidies, make people carry phones around for four years, and more people will care about subsidies</p>
<p>Only slightly related to this article (and because I&#8217;m currently hungry) &#8211; if you&#8217;re a Jelly Belly fan, go to your local dollar store and buy a bag of Jelly Belly Flops. It&#8217;s a grab bag of all the mistakes off the production line.  So while they may look like freaks, they taste just as good, and only cost a buck.</p>
<p>The bigger issue here that isn&#8217;t really being addressed is the ramifications of Android 2.x being the lowest common denominator environment for developers to target. Google does a few things to ease this but I&#8217;m wondering how much, if at all, this problem is responsible for the poor quality of many Android apps? It seems to me having the latest &amp; greatest APIs available makes your life easier and allows you to build better apps faster.  I haven&#8217;t developed for Android but I&#8217;ve dabbled in iOS development and even for my simple needs I would hate to go back and work with the iOS4 SDK. Apple has added so much in iOS5/6 for developers. If I had to target iOS4 I would have to re-invent the wheel for quite a few things. (and this is for extremely bare-bones apps I&#8217;m developing mostly for educational purposes. I can imagine a real app would be even more of a struggle)</p>
<p>Customers don&#8217;t appear to know or really care &#8211; RAZR continues to outsell the Nexus on Verizon:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/06/26/apples_iphone_4s_remains_top_selling_smartphone_at_verizon.html" target="_blank">http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/06/26/apples_iphone_4s_remains_top_selling_smartphone_at_verizon.html</a></p>
<p>that&#8217;s because the average consumer isn&#8217;t an update-hungry geek.<br />
there, I said it. and I&#8217;m an update-hungry geek.</p>
<p> the mobile tech world is relatively young and its evolving, i strongly believe that as consumers (users) clamor for faster updates of the android operating system on their devices, OEMs will start to see that this plays an important role  in the users choice of device, it will get taken more seriously. so far HTC and Samsung have seriously improved in the delivery of their updates to devices capable of recieving them.</p>
<p>Hey a new brand international samsung galaxy S2 ships with Android 4.0.3 (bought one for my lil sis last week off amazon), for stock android i suggest you remain using nexuses*.</p>
<p>Currently using an S3 and i really enjoy the touchwiz interface, i think its really good, though I&#8217;ll customizing it as soon as i get some free time and in a few weeks after sorting some bills I&#8217;ll be picking the nexus 7 for the custom jelly bean experience. A simple solution.</p>
<p>My dreams may sound irrational, but XDA Developers are so good and spitting out ROMS, maybe Google could somehow make them an authority on getting versions out to phones not getting it done for legacy phones? They seem to embrace being bold and innovative but a little too skiddish at times to push the product harder.<br />
I have ICS on an HD2 and a Samsung Vibrant for crying out loud. And they don&#8217;t just kind of work they work, they real well, better than the OEM stock. No extara weight and recharge after two day use.. Wi-Di even works, no bullshit.</p>
<p>The corporate machine has its place, but the biggest caveat is lack of speed to transition and slow adaptability. That only happens in open environments like XDA. I wish there was a way to legitimize those builds into the mainstream more easily. I want to have a more competitive arena between XDA and actual OEMs over their current phones. Like I said irrational, sky high dream.</p>
<p>xda cant fix everything. On the HD2 (which I owned), it took them a very long time to get the port done properly. My galaxytab 10.1  bricked after 2 weeks running cyanogen 9 ICS. My 8.9 is still running ok but it&#8217;s starting to get very unstable. Both camera not working.</p>
<p>Dieter, how blase you&#8217;re being with Microsoft&#8217;s shocking betrayal of all its WP7 customers is amazing. In any case, after your, ahem, <strong>fantastic</strong> video comparison of Siri and Google Now I can&#8217;t quite bring myself to trust your judgement very much. Vlad for president!</p>
<p>Welcome to the Bohn Zone</p>
<p>all the more reason to get a nexus device :D</p>
<p>Regardless of all the pissing and moaning about updates among the tech community, it always seems that the average consumer is completely content with using whatever OS the phone ships with. I&#8217;ve had several friends using the same iOS4 firmware that shipped with their iPhones, thinking that the newer features that came with iOS5 would only be available to those who purchased an iPhone 4S. Same with a friend with Android, who found the &#8220;firmware update is available for this device&#8221; as more of an inconvenience that he would dismiss.</p>
<p>A lot of Android users don&#8217;t really care about the version they are running.  My wife, for example, didn&#8217;t notice any difference when her T-Mobile G2 went from Froyo to Gingerbread.  Most Android phone users, I suspect, fall into this category.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the people who know and care, and are the type of people who read the Verge.  If you are in that camp, you should know enough to buy a Nexus device.</p>
<p>Perhaps Google force partners to provide an optional/downloadable Stock Android build? So when Jelly Beans or Chocolate Sundae or whatever comes out, I can get it on my phone in stock and when HTC manages to get around integrating Sense, it can be pushed as an OTA update.</p>
<p>Wishful thinking I know but it is an interesting question:</p>
<p>What can Google do realistically to solve the Andorid Fragmentation Issue?</p>
<p>When will we get the update to JB? Well, to answer that question, I suppose you have to know what kind of user you are. If you&#8217;re the type of person who doesn&#8217;t really care about which updates your phone gets, and you&#8217;re perfectly happy with just having a phone that does the the things that let you live your online life more pervasively and your offline live more efficiently, then who cares about the update to JB? There really are only a few minor upgrades, and they deal with the UI. As we&#8217;ve all seen time and time again, when a UI changes, a lot of non-technophiles feel uncomfortable with it.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re the kind of person that really cares about having the latest and greatest operating system version, then you&#8217;re probably the kind of person who knows how to load custom ROMs. In that case, the update to JB will be released quickly for your device, and you&#8217;ll probably swear up and down how great it is to have a phone without all the proprietary junk installed by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>So there you have it. Either you don&#8217;t care, or you&#8217;ll have it in a few weeks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m relieved that my phone Nexus S is in the list, but again, I would be receiving my Nexus 7 in 2-3 weeks and I would use that more than my phone.</p>
<p>Tizen?</p>
<p>If you want reliable updates to your phone, vote with your wallet, only buy Nexus devices.</p>
<p>The way I got it figured, the only time I will see an update from version 2.3.6 is when I replace my Samsung Galaxy S2 Epic Touch from Sprint.</p>
<p>in the android community, the only reliable way to get an update is to just buy a new phone.</p>
<p>Made me lol and cry at the same time.</p>
<p>Bravo sir.</p>
<p>I am so glad I have a Nexus device right now. So, so glad.</p>
<p>Linux deserves better than esoteric jabber about &#8220;custom roms&#8221; or &#8220;distros&#8221; in the olden days.</p>
<p>The problem is most of these handset makers don&#8217;t give a crap about the software on their devices.  They don&#8217;t care who makes it, what it&#8217;s called or that people want updates.  Hardware companies just get whatever they is cheap and push it out the door to flood the market with this financial quarter.</p>
<p>This is the type of fragmentation Google really need to fix in order for me to switch. I hate that this is the case, I should be the one that decides when to upgrade my phone not the carrier.</p>
<p>This is an incredibly revealing quote:<br />
<blockquote>We&#8217;ve actually started with this release — a beta of the Jelly Bean PDK has already been available to a few partners for the last few weeks and they&#8217;ve been providing us valuable feedback. We&#8217;ve incorporated that feedback and now it&#8217;s available to everyone on an ongoing basis. PDK enables Android OEMs and chipset makers to innovate in parallel with Google and ensure the latest Android release can be well-optimized for their hardware.</blockquote></p>
<p>In other words, given the PDK ahead of time, the manufacturers didn&#8217;t leap to start porting Jelly Bean to their devices. Instead, they <em>asked for changes in Jelly Bean</em>. And Google made some of those changes, meaning nobody could count on the PDK to be final until the changes were made.</p>
<p>The result here isn&#8217;t a shortening of the development cycle, it&#8217;s a lengthening. Now there&#8217;ll be a get-approval-from-manufacturers cycle before they start porting. That may speed up the process of porting somewhat, because the changes asked for may be the ones that the manufacturers would have had to make on their own, but count on it to be marginal.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s simply no incentive for these companies to waste money on a device they already shipped and that, like all phones released today, is fast approaching obsolescence.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;ll never buy an Android device unless it is shipped and designed to work with a stock firmware. I hate stupid skinning and branding made by manufacturers that nobody cares about.</p>
<p>Samsung, HTC, Asus &amp; Co. &#8212; you are all great hardware manufacturers, but please don&#8217;t put your filthy software on these devices.</p>
<blockquote>Consider this: the Droid RAZR was announced on the same day as the Galaxy Nexus. Eight months later, the Android 4.0 update for the RAZR was released in the same week that Google announced Android 4.1.</blockquote>
<p>This is a serious problem that Google turns it&#8217;s back on.</p>
<p>As much as I love Android, and it&#8217;s openness and customization, the fragmentation on it sucks. I have more faith in XDA devs than OEM. It&#8217;s to the point I just want the OEM for the hardware, and the XDA devs for the software.</p>
<p>So because the Nexus 7 is straight from Google&#8217;s store, does that mean it will update right from Google, and skip the wait for Asus to issue theirs?</p>
<p>yes it does. just like the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>BTW, anyone know if Samsung will update the non-US GNs to Jelly Bean or we&#8217;ll have to hack it first so it gets Google&#8217;s updates?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it has said that current devices won&#8217;t receive the full Windows Phone 8 update, so from that perspective the company has failed to do the work to keep its current users up-to-date. However, Microsoft has at least given its users clear and unambiguous guidance about what to expect. Google cannot corral even its closest partners into saying which devices will receive updates and when — last year&#8217;s promise notwithstanding.&#8221;<br />
Kudos Mr Bohn. I too have been saying this from the beginning. Oh dear, here come the Fandroid&#8217;s wrath</p>
<p>the fandroids will direct their wrath at windows phone for not having the full 8 update. Of course, like I have been saying, they will be oblivious to their own miserable plight; which is that the vast majority of them won&#8217;t even have an update&#8230; at all. Most android are still stuck on gingerbread and older.</p>
<p>So true. My Droid DX2 never got updated. Its still got the same old GB and same old random reboots. I can&#8217;t believe I paid $200 for a phone that was abandoned a few months after release.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even have ICS yet, and I so want Jelly Bean!</p>
<p>LG: we poromise to update your devices to Gingerbread!</p>
<p>one year later&#8230;. &#8220;delayed. watch this space.&#8221;&#8230; months later &#8220;delayed. watch this space.&#8221;</p>
<p>ICS launches</p>
<p>LG: We decided to skip gingerbread and promise to update <strong>your existing device</strong> to ICS.</p>
<p>1 year later&#8230;&#8230; <br />
<del>-</del>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
Samsung: GTab 10.1 and 8.9 don&#8217;t have enough memory for ICS. We will not update them</p>
<p>one month later&#8230;</p>
<p>samsung: we will update them to ics.</p>
<p>one month later&#8230;</p>
<p>samsung: oh wait&#8230; we won&#8217;t lawl!!</p>
<p>8 months later&#8230;</p>
<p>samsung: ics will come to Gtab 10.1 and 8.9&#8230; some time.</p>
<p>waiting&#8230;. waiting&#8230;. waiting&#8230;.</p>
<p>A year after Google and partners pledged to issue timely updates, the situation has gotten worse, not better. Here&#8217;s a careful analysis (by yours truly) of the adoption rates of the Gingerbread vs. ICS. Punch line: 8 months after release, ICS is being adopted into the wider Android userbase at a rate of 2.6% per month. Gingerbread was being adopted more than 2x faster, at 6.8% per month.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=28243054" target="_blank">http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=28243054</a></p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t even use the term &#8220;adoption rate&#8221; because that aimplies the end user has any semblance of choice on whether to update or not.</p>
<p>in this case, only the oem hold that power. I&#8217;d term it as &#8220;update rate&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>I’d term it as "update rate"</blockquote>
<p>very clever idea&#8230;&#8230;..adoption rate is totally misleading</p>
<p>I bet Samsung already forgot they manufactured S2</p>
<p>Android just seems to be all over the place, with no even partial remedy in sight. Having got ICS on an Xperia device after months of waiting, pretty disheartening to find even more buggy than before! Even with powerful hardware, the lack of fluidity and inefficiency just seems shocking.</p>
<p>Presumably like many people, I&#8217;m going to be watching Nokia/Microsoft very closely this Autumn. A PureView Windows 8 Phone that looks half-decent could be a very hard date to turn down!</p>
<p>@Google needs to really work on this otherwise any notion of a consistent user experience on the @Android platform is gonna be a joke!</p>
<p>Android sure does come up with stupid names for their os. Whats up with that?</p>
<p>Planet-Privacy.tk</p>
<p>Yeah. Speaking as a happy iOS user, I can safely say that were I ever to switch to Android, it would HAVE to be a Nexus device. Google is doing some great work with Android (Google Glass looks thoroughly goofy, though&#8230;). But, I just don&#8217;t trust the manufacturers one bit to support their products. And, looking at all these skins on HTC and Samsung devices&#8230; I don&#8217;t care for them at all. I actually like Sony&#8217;s skin, but they&#8217;re still dragging their feet on updates as well. Vanilla Android is just so much more streamlined, even if it isn&#8217;t crammed full of as many half-baked features that only exist to fill up a spec sheet.</p>
<p>All but the Nexus devices have this air of disposability to them&#8230; at least to me. Just devices designed to be bought, used until the next one comes around, and discarded. It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re poorly made, it&#8217;s just that the manufacturers don&#8217;t seem interested in actually supporting their devices after they&#8217;ve been paid for.</p>
<p>buy a nexus, problem solved forever</p>
<p>We&#8217;re at the start of the 2-year upgrade cycle for a lot of Gingerbread users.  I expect ICS will start taking off very soon.</p>
<p>People forget that Google is essentially a year ahead of the general public.  The Nexus devices carrying the latest OS versions are meant to get Android purists and developers a head start so that when an OS version goes mainstream there will be apps that work on it.  With the OEM  lag, this means that a new OS version isn&#8217;t on prodcution line devices for at least 4-6 months.  That means, most OEMs are only now standardizing around ICS and they are going to be working on updating older devices in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my bold prediction.  By Christmas 2012, out of 600 million devices accessing the Play store, 1 in 10 devices will have Jelly Bean on it, and another 40% will have Ice Cream Sandwich on it.  The upgrade cycle and the fact that most new Android users will be buying ICS devices going forward.</p>
<p>Google should work with their big partners like HTC, Samsung,  Motorola, etc. in order to help them start working on updates earlier</p>
<p>Or just force Motorola do use stock and see if others follow suit to compete.</p>
<p>Update my Nexus already Verizon!</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m08tljczcs1qa7rld.gif" /></p>
<p>Curse you carriers!!!!!</p>
<p>I thought Nexus devices weren&#8217;t stopped by the carriers from getting updates?</p>
<p>Except for Verizon. They just can&#8217;t seem to help themselves.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t know that. That&#8217;s rather disappointing, whole point of Nexus devices was to get the carriers and manufacturers out of the way of my OS update.  Sigh, that sucks.</p>
<p>Sprint as well. Both CDMA by coincidence, but it&#8217;s definitely the carriers that are delaying the updates.</p>
<p>Only the Google Play Store unlocked model is getting direct updates, which is only compatible with GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.</p>
<p>All hail Europe&#8217;s socialist state intervention and smart frequency auctioning!</p>
<p>I really wonder how the would be with a similar system. I think we need something that works for customers and not leave them at the almighty mercy of carriers.</p>
<p>Actually&#8230; incorrect. Its not only the Google Play model that gets direct updates.</p>
<p>Networks in the UK/EU sell the GSM/HSPA model, and its actually network locked (I think). But updates still come from Google.</p>
<p>Some Irish Galaxy Nexus are updated by Samsung. It is all a bit random. You only know after you buy.</p>
<p>I think Samsung and Google work together on the updates.</p>
<p>The only point of a Nexus device is to get the latest version of Android just after it launches. Everything else is just a pipe dream unless you are willing to install a rom. You might have to or maybe not. Random toss up.</p>
<p>While that would be nice, at least it is very easy for a non-hacker like me to root and put a Jellybean ROM on the Gnex with all the great tools available.  This was not the case with my last 2 moto devices.</p>
<p>Well, I am pretty sure that the Verizon Galaxy Nexus is one the AOSP tree, meaning you can manually install updates, just not OTA.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly easy to install a JB rom on the Verizon Gnex, even for those who are technologically challenged.  Plus, because it&#8217;s so popular, there is a quite large selection of roms to choose from for the Gnex.  Installing a rom usually means no OTA updates, so I barely noticed the fact that Verizon is being a bitch about them.</p>
<p>Canadian carriers as well.</p>
<p>I gave up waiting and rooted.  I have no confidence in Verizon delivery the update before mid October.</p>
<p>Ditto. Used the WugFresh Tool and Rom Manager to easily upgrade to Android 4.1.1 without losing any of my existing app data.</p>
<p><img src="http://img1.jurko.net/avatar_1497.gif" /></p>
<p>CM10 on the Verizon SG3 is insanity. My friend free yourself from touchwiz and unlock the potential of your device.</p>
<p>Is it fair to still call touchwiz Android, because what Google calls ICS or jellybean is not that similar to the touchwiz based 4.0 &amp; 4.1. Touchwiz based on 4.0 seems to have more in common with gingerbread than ice cream sandwich.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tempted, but reading the thread and seeing the issues I think it&#8217;s best if i wait for it to go live</p>
<p>My GS2 is waiting for delicious Jelly Beans.</p>
<p>Cm10 is waiting for you</p>
<p>I just got my Galaxy S3 on Verizon last month..Im hearing JB on S3 by the end of the August Finally I got the recent update here <a href="http://www.careace.net/2012/08/29/samsung-saysgalaxy-s-iii-and-note-10-1-to-be-receive-android-4-1-jelly-bean-update-very-soon/" target="_blank">http://www.careace.net/2012/08/29/samsung-saysgalaxy-s-iii-and-note-10-1-to-be-receive-android-4-1-jelly-bean-update-very-soon/</a></p>
<p>I would have rooted and installed already but can&#8217;t stomach the data wipe.</p>
<p>So then root, backup, and go for it. Restore just the data afterwards&#8230;</p>
<p>Still no Jelly Bean for the Samsung controlled versions of the unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>You guys, Nexus phones are meant to be developer devices first and foremost. A typical developer should not be afraid of rooting and installing a ROM&#8230;</p>
<p>Honestly, if you&#8217;re going to root and install a ROM, why not choose something closer to stock?</p>
<p>Lol, so the American and European variants of the GS3 might get an update before Verizon&#8217;s Galaxy Nexus and other OEM Android 4.0 devices? So much for &#8220;if you care about updates, get a nexus&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>European variants </blockquote>
<p>The European model is actually the international model, no variant.</p>
<p>Those custom UIs reduce what customers feel and get from Android version upgrade. Google, please do something.</p>
<p>Just installed stock Jellybean on my AT&amp;T SG3.  So much better than than TouchWiz crap.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m rooted and I want to know if I would receive a notification telling me that the update is available and if I have the possibility to update even if I&#8217;m rooted #I&#8217;dont&#8217;care&#8217;if&#8217;iI&#8217;ll&#8217;loose&#8217;root#<strong></strong></p>

<p>Ew, it hurts to think that the talent of this site used to be wasted on Engadget.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a tech news site fanboy, buddy. Apple is enough.</p>
<p>Please grow up.</p>
<p>Irony. How about you grow up and learn that people can like more than one thing, especially news websites.</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Please link me to or quote me on where I suggested people cannot like more than one thing&#8230;</p>
<p>I hate the tangent that you have caused.</p>
<p>SNORE!</p>
<p>YAY! FIGHTING ON THE INTERNET!</p>
<p>Phew! I was worried I&#8217;d have to read an article!</p>
<p>Your original bash was petty and childish. Engadget was the birth of this team. It is what brought them together. Without Engadget, The Verge may not have been what it is.</p>
<p>Engadget isn&#8217;t a bad site. They do a great job of covering everything tech and not getting too far away from tech (because they know they&#8217;re not that kind of site). The Verge covers the most important or interesting tech, with sort-of related content on the side. And The Verge was born because Joshua Topolsky found that Engadget restricted him from doing just that in the right fashion (if I&#8217;m not mistaken).</p>
<p>I read both and I like both. Even though The Verge is a higher quality site in most aspects.</p>
<p>Please shrink down.</p>
<p>before the verge team left, engadget was a pretty damn good site.</p>
<p>Just need Myriam &amp; Richard:/</p>
<p>Richard sure but Myriam, please no.</p>
<p>Agreed with both names.  Myriam needs a better platform for her zing, and it aint at Engadget.  Listening to anything on Engadget now is like watching The Office&#8230;  except not funny.  All the awkward, none of the humor.</p>
<p>Well, then it&#8217;s exactly like &#8220;The Office&#8221;.</p>
<p>Please God no Myriam.  Great writer, podcast slayer.</p>
<p>I love Myriam! Didn&#8217;t know people actually disliked her so much&#8230;</p>
<p>Large majority of the Verge readers came from reading Engadget and followed that talent here.</p>
<p>Yeah it is circular logic by me, Engadget is bad because these guys left. So I guess when Josh etc.. were there it wasn&#8217;t bad that they were there.</p>
<p>engadget is not that bad as a tech site, I get the idea the verge is trying for some more personal and multi-medial approach, which I appreciate. but as a site, I think of the verge still as Beta and while I enjoy the content, the layout of engadget is more intuitive and clean. Sometimes I just get  lost at the homepage of the verge and usually just stick to facebook feed, which is chronological.</p>
<p>my point is, the verge offers some extra-nerdy content I enjoy, but I would not ditch engadget as &#8220;bad&#8221; site. In some ways, I find it even better</p>
<p>I just find that none of the writers have any real passion for what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Like&#8230; their podcast, my word, so bland.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that their passionless but their podcasts have certainly gotten a bit more dull. Also I sometimes feel that they get excessively hung up on minutia. I sometimes think Myriam especially will verbalize her nerd dreams about really silly items, such as her desire for an interface option to remap the Android navigation keys. Why is that important?!</p>
<p>So, Engadget is bad now after the Apple fanboys left? I say the opposite, they are much better than the homers here.</p>
<p>So&#8230;why do you read this site?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.unnecessaryumlaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/HomerSimpson.jpg" /></p>
<p>I came from Gizmodo, and holy crap, this stuff is better. Engadget was never able to hold my interest, even when Josh et al were still there. The site was kind of boring, and the gems were hard to find in all the noise. I liked that Giz did some braching out from straight technology thanks to the other Gawker sites&#8217; content. The Verge has a very interesting design aesthetic that I really like, and they tend to carry other news that&#8217;s tangential to  technology without having to put up with the large amount of noise at both Giz and Engadget.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a general anti-engadget sentiment around here, but my god, Giz? It&#8217;s a good thing you saw the light when you did!</p>
<p>I used to love Engadget back in the day.. Now I&#8217;m definitely more of a Verge fan but I don&#8217;t think that means I have to try to pretend that I never used to enjoy engadget and bash it.  I just no longer visit the site.</p>
<p>I prefer Matias shirt 2012 version.</p>
<p>Josh always looks happier when Matias is around.  I sense love.</p>
<p>That shirt.</p>
<p>DAT SHIRT.</p>
<p>&#8230;.risky&#8230;..but the priiiiiize.</p>
<p>Designers. They are always into weird stuff.</p>
<p>Many people can&#8217;t pull off that shirt. Matias Duarte does.</p>
<p>Some men can wear speedos, most shouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>No men should wear sppedos.</p>
<p>Just add a comma, and that sentence changes DRAMATICALLY.</p>
<p>DAT GRAMMAR</p>
<p>I wear speedos. It doesn&#8217;t bother me that rednecks don&#8217;t dig them, they just don&#8217;t know any better.</p>
<p>Not everybody who dislikes the speedo is a redneck.</p>
<p>Not every man shouldn&#8217;t wear a speedo.</p>
<p>I want a &#8220;Deal with it.&#8221; speedo.<br />
&#8220;It&#8221; referring to my package, Captain Obvious strikes again!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, just looks like a dorky guy in a silly shirt to me.  Then again I have no pants on so it evens out&#8230;.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a point. We could pick apart his style, but his hair says &#8216;DORK&#8217;. AMIRITE?</p>
<p>When I pull off a shirt, I like to go collar-over-head, followed by the arms.  Try it!<br />
TROLOLOL :)</p>
<p>I do arms first, it lets me pull weird stuff off easier.</p>

<p>Project Butter just revolutionized Android. This update really changes the game.</p>
<p>This changes everything&#8230;again&#8230;</p>
<p>xD</p>
<p>Welcome to iOS 1, June 29, 2007.</p>
<p>And iOS 6 is still adding things that have been in Android over the past few years dating back to Android Cupcake.</p>
<p>Like the whole operating system like Android did rip off iOS?</p>
<p>Exactly what ripped off?</p>
<p>Just take a look at Android before the first iPhone and after it.</p>
<p>Who cares if they &#8216;copied&#8217; (they didn&#8217;t anyway, the G1 was quite different from the iPhone) the iPhone. Android&#8217;s gone on to do some amazing stuff that because of Apple&#8217;s extreme walled-garden, iOS could never hope to do.</p>
<p>Most of that stuff is pretty useless to the average customer. And that extreme walled-garden is responsible for things like this: <a href="https://twitter.com/mikko/status/218329213420322817" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/mikko/status/218329213420322817</a></p>
<p>Everyone stands on the shoulders of giants. So can&#8217;t everyone just get along with their gadget that suits their needs best?</p>
<p>If Android was a stolen product (as Jobs believed) then so was iPhone (and that&#8217;s not talking about things like notifications etc) as detailed by Ars <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/02/if-android-is-a-stolen-product-then-so-was-the-iphone/1/" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/02/if-android-is-a-stolen-product-then-so-was-the-iphone/1/</a></p>
<p>Android before iPhone.<br />
<img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2007/11/android_boot.jpg" /></p>
<p>Are you an iOS user that cares when Android is late to features?</p>
<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57452059-233/the-iphone-may-be-late-to-features-but-only-android-users-care/"></a></p>
<p>Still not reading the dates</p>
<p>Google was ripping off Microsoft before the iPhone came out.  Google even kept the menu home and back buttons forever.  They just replaced the joystick with touch.</p>

<p>I suppose my chances of not being in a car crash are improved if I never get in a car. That said, if I behave responsibly and take all the necessary safety measures and precautions, the risk of being in a car crash, though still there, is at an acceptable level that almost universally people accept that risk to add more enjoyment to their lives. I have never had a virus on my phone because I take the necessary precautions to protect myself like not loading from unknown sources and being selective in what apps I  download. But feel free to take the safe route&#8230;</p>
<p>God fanboys are so naive. Ios hasn&#8217;t really changed in 5 years while google is blowing them out of the water. ICS and now Jelly bean are putting other mobile platforms to shame. If you are simple and not tech savy then I&#8217;d recommend ios or WP.</p>
<p>Yes keep saying that iOS hasn&#8217;t changed in 5 years&#8230;.. The UI didn&#8217;t chance dramatically but it didn&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>Of Android, that started as beta product had a lot more change done&#8230;. You seem to imply that it&#8217;s better to start as crap, since then you can improve a lot.</p>
<p>Weeeeell that&#8217;s not entirely true. Let&#8217;s take the home button for example, it now has double and triple taps which goes against the core design principles of iOS and it&#8217;s one of the reasons iOS succeeded where early Nokia touch OSes failed.</p>
<p>The issue is that they designed an OS that couldn&#8217;t be scaled upon and rather then changing their OS like android did with ICS they are trying to make it work with the limitations and it&#8217;s really starting to show.</p>
<p>The difference is not that android is in beta, the difference is android is developed upon the principles of Screw it, we are going to make the most feature rich and functional OS out there and iOS is developed as We have a very recognisable layout that consumers trust and we need to add features to that without changing it.</p>
<p>The pros are that they have achieved a very recognisable layout and experience, the cons are that they have baked themselves down a corner now. Almost everyone that&#8217;s objective says iOS, at least from a design perspective, is stuck in the past and needs to be more dynamic.</p>
<p>Who cares where it started? You wouldn&#8217;t buy a G1 or an Original iPhone, so it&#8217;s a moot point. Now (And arguably, for quite some time), Android is superior and more innovative.</p>
<p>Android has no serious malware either.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;the G1 was quite different from the iPhone&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Hardware=/software</p>
<p>he was talking about android 1.0</p>
<blockquote>he was talking about android 1.0</blockquote>
<p>And how resembles Android 1.0 to iOS?</p>
<p>Carbon copy.</p>
<p>Your a very sad person.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re</p>
<p>Yeah tha doesn&#8217;t make any sense. Try again.</p>
<p>iOS6: redefining the word troll since 2012</p>
<p>You know man the Widgets, Picture Messaging, REAL Notifications, etc.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t you read his username (iOS6)? It&#8217;s an obvious novelty troll account.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s novelty</p>
<p>Still troll.</p>
<p>And I was talking about the G1. Which, again, is and was different from the iPhone.</p>
<blockquote>Just take a look at Android before the first iPhone and after it.</blockquote>
<p>What Android BEFORE the iPhone? Do you work at Google to know how it was?</p>
<p>Ah, and you&#8217;re confusing HARDWARE with SOFTWARE</p>
<p><a href="http://devilsworkshop.org/real-android-phone-iphone-released/">See for yourself</a></p>
<p>Do you know how to read dates?</p>
<p>Ah, and this is HARDWARE, not SOFTWARE</p>
<p>can&#8217;t you see <strong>TAG ON PICTURE?</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.devilsworkshop.org/files/2012/05/Android_preiPhone.png" /></p>
<p>Yes, a picture from NOVEMBER 2.007.</p>
<p>Still confusing hardware with software</p>
<p>are you a Bot&gt;? a google bot ?</p>
<p>The phone was never released.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t imagine what happened that made Google cancel that phone&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not get into these endless, repetitive conversations again.</p>
<p>That and many articles like it have been thoroughly debunked. Google had a touch prototype as well as that one. It&#8217;s not difficult to understand that a company might want to cultivate multiple different options and device types.</p>
<p>Google ripped off Apple&#8217;s awesome notifications, LMFAO. After all these years Apple still can&#8217;t get it right.</p>
<p>Android&#8217;s such a rip off that Apple&#8217;s been copy damn near all of ANDROID&#8217;s features..?! Wow.</p>
<p>The one thing they should copy is the psychological stuff in the iOS.  If an app crashes and you don&#8217;t tell the user that it crashed, they don&#8217;t consider it a crash.  It took even me a while to notice that my netflix app on iOS was crashing more frequently compared to my OG motorola droid netflix app.  Its because there was no feedback that it was crashing it didn&#8217;t register in my mind immediately as a crash.  They need to get more on the Apple bandwagon of faking speed and tricking the user into thinking something is a responsive instead of trying to engineer responsiveness.</p>
<p>Lying and deceiving isn&#8217;t Google&#8217;s game. Let Apple have that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re joking, right? Even if we play along with your ridiculous extrapolation, do you honestly think Google never lies and deceives?</p>
<p>Well, yes, I think most of us do. They&#8217;re very upfront in their privacy policy about what they do and don&#8217;t do. And when something in that policy changes, they&#8217;re very public about it as well. Anything else is a business-style trade secret, which <strong>no</strong> company can actually afford to divulge.</p>
<p>But i like to yell at the developers for making a shitty experience</p>
<p>I just have a thought here. People are always bitching that Android &#8220;ripped off&#8221; Apple. &#8220;Just take a look at Android before the first iPhone and after it.&#8221; Well may I point something out to you? You know what happened to companies that didn&#8217;t &#8220;rip off&#8221; Apple. Their market share shriveled. Google didn&#8217;t copy, they simply adapted to the market. The market happened to be a touch interface with applications that performed many tasks that smart phones of that day (blackberries) didn&#8217;t,</p>
<p>Ding Ding Ding! We have a winner!</p>
<p>Touch  based phones were on their way in, with or without the iphone. There were a lot of breakthroughs in touchscreen technology leading up to 2007.(such as <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html" target="_blank">http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_han_demos_his_breakthrough_touchscreen.html</a> )</p>
<p>The technology was finally ripe for consumer use.</p>
<p>ehh&#8230; id say android has jacked alot of things from webos. alot in part to duarte</p>
<p>And android still hasn&#8217;t gotten the basics down like scrolling.</p>
<p>???</p>
<p>have you ever even used an Android phone because that comment makes no sense.</p>
<p>The OSes both have their weaknesses, but it&#8217;s fun to see how they&#8217;ve both addressed them over the years&#8230; or completely ignored and went a different direction entirely.</p>
<p>Right, that OS that had even less (read:none) multitasking abilities than it has today. Or was it that OS that didn&#8217;t let you use a wallpaper? Or was it that OS with a notification system that interupted you constantly? Or was it that OS that couldn&#8217;t update OTA?</p>
<p>Danger before Microsoft poisoning updated the Hiptop OTA on T-Mobile back in 2002.  Granted not Apple nor Google was something that coulda been done much MUCH earlier.</p>
<p>lol iOS1 was not butter, I can assure you that. Neither was iOS 2 or 3. It didn&#8217;t get smooth until the very end of 3 and lagged again when 4 came out, then improved with the later versions of 4. Now, I agree it is pretty buttery, but not perfect. Neither is Jellybean, but much improved for sure.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not entirely true — it was <em>so much</em> smoother than any other device around at the time. I used to debug the quartz graphic rendering on an iPod touch 1G (these things were slower than the iPhone 3G). It was amazing how far they pushed the tiny amount of hardware in those devices.</p>
<p>A lot of the UI did run at 60 fps, though you couldn&#8217;t push it too far (e.g., older hardware couldn&#8217;t have background images behind the springboard, due to performance optimizations to make scrolling smooth). It shows how much Apple valued the smoothness of their UI that they would restrict a feature such as background images to ensure that scrolling a bunch of icons was as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>One of my personal reasons for avoiding Android up until now was that they didn&#8217;t have a very good rendering system. Apple seems to be full of computer graphics programmers, and they have built a very nice compositing system into iOS from the beginning (and Mac OS X).</p>
<p>This is how you wish it was. Go look up iPhone 1 2007 launch videos from regular consumers using it. Do you not see smoothness? I even have one in the drawer and can confirm that there is no lag in scrolling or tapping, etc.</p>
<p>They(Google) stolen it from my Grand grand father aka iOS 1</p>
<p>wow really&#8230;.do i need to bring my bus out from the lot and take another fanboy to school?</p>
<p>i know right ? fandroids are poor people &amp; some of them are bus drivers. how poor.</p>
<p>He meant you, dude.</p>
<p>actually, he meant to say he is a poor bus driver. don&#8217;t you get it?!</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish there was a downvote button to hide the obvious trolls like you but unfortunately, we have Flag button only.</p>
<p>Look at you, you&#8217;ve derailed  the course of usual healthy discussion with your nonsense trolling. Congrats</p>
<p>look at the iphone its a straight nokia design&#8230;..look at the ring switch straight Palm Treo ripoff&#8230;..notifications on iOS rip off.  Apple shuts down devs that have features that will later introduce and leave them in the dark.  I can keep going if you want?</p>
<p>Here we go with the elitist mentality of an apple fanboy. I-phones are digital jewelry for people that think apple is only for those who have money. Yes there are low end android devices out there because it open source but anyone who knows anything about tech realizes that being able to choose from various flagship devices within a year is amazing. I-sheep put money down on an apple device before they even know the specs. Bah little ignorant sheep the android army is strong and has apple shaking in their boots.</p>
<p>Not really. And stop calling people sheep. The fanbois and fandroids are equally irritating. What I hate among fandroids is that they have to come into every conversation and expound on Android&#8217;s &#8220;groundbreaking&#8221; features and that Apple fans are sheep and idiots and have dated OS. It&#8217;s all bullsh*t. Apple fanbois are equally bad with their elitist mentality and thinking that the iPhone is the only phone you should own.</p>
<p>CHILL OUT. Both OS&#8217; have their own advantages and disadvantages. Android has the advantage in a beautiful digital/modern UI (which is now extremely smooth thanks to Project Butter) and the best Google experience you can get with Gmail, Maps and Chrome. Not to mention an improved notification system, the new promising Google Now feature and endless customization options. I love my SGSII. Though if I knew enough about Android and stock software last year to the extent that I know this year, I would have waited out for a Nexus device or an iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, has a simple, yet effective UX that anyone can pick up and play. Heck my 2 year old niece knows how to freaking use an iPhone! Do you know how amazing that is?! It may be too boring for us power users, but for most &#8220;casual&#8221; and non techie consumers, it&#8217;s a boon. Plus you can&#8217;t forget the fact though Android has relatively caught up in the apps department, majority of the best 3rd party apps still are on iOS. And let&#8217;s not get started on games. There&#8217;s a reason why almost all game journalists have iPhones and not Android phones. It&#8217;s a haven for indie games. iOS is helping resurrect indie games development, above Steam and PSN/XBLA.</p>
<p>So chill the Eff out and just enjoy both platforms. I don&#8217;t know why fanbois have to act so DAMN Entitled to iOS and Android. You don&#8217;t OWE them anything. Chill out!</p>
<p>Aplause. Fandroids need to understand they just as annoying as iFans. <br />
Both OSs are fine (I own both) and there is not need to keep insulting everyone that buys Apple.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;fandroids are poor people&#8221;</strong>&#8230; smh. end of conversation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll have to be the short Bus</p>
<p>all they do (Google/android) is look to apple tech for innovations they can rip off</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gifbin.com/981365"><img src="http://gifs.gifbin.com/305sw887589.gif" alt="funny gifs" /></a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not fair, they took a lot from WebOS, too!</p>
<p>Oh please I think we all know that they have ripped each off in equal amounts already. Apple needs to make their notifications more like Android because they are still very annoying.</p>
<p>keep telling yourself that!</p>
<p>You are complete and total moron &#8220;.&#8221;</p>
<p>No fair.  Android was originally made to rip off Windows Phone 6, and it was made to run on Windows Phone hardware anyways.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.slashphone.com/sp/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Samsung-Omnia-735-Pro-4-Germany-available.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is no &#8220;Windows Phone 6,&#8221; could you possibly mean &#8220;Windows Mobile 6?&#8221;  You make accusations but diminish your comment and stance with lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>You knew what I meant.  Thanks for fixing the small detail.</p>
<p>The main argument stands.</p>
<p>You mean your ignorant and stupid argument?  What&#8217;s it standing on?  Ballmer&#8217;s crooked legs?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right.  They were ripping off Win Mobile 6 and also RIM.</p>
<p>  Android was made to rip off Win Mobile 6 / RIM.  Look at the prototypes.  Then look at Android after the iPhone.</p>
<p>There were 2 prototypes &#8211; a keyboard version and a full screen version &#8211; YouTube it.  As for ripping off designs, I can see a resemblance to a Palm device for the one with a keyboard.</p>
<p>To fair fair there was a windows phone 6.5</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t remember that wm6.5 looked like this. It&#8217;s kinda nice&#8230;. yes I know, I have a thing for old mobile operating sistems..</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t choose. You just watch both. WelcomeMatiastothevergeduartedesignphilosophypawl.</p>
<p>Do you really think the Vergecast is going to start on time.</p>
<p>Its started</p>
<p>Yes but the Matias video came up right before 3p.m. and the Vergecast started 30 minutes late so he did have time.</p>
<p>26 minutes late Vergecast so you can watch both :)</p>

<p>Good to hear that Josh pronounces ASUS correctly</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/17/how-to-pronounce-asus-video/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/17/how-to-pronounce-asus-video/</a></p>

<p>Dear Verge,</p>
<p>please switch your video to HTML5.  I&#8217;m on ICS with Chrome browser, and this page it telling my I need flash.  Of course I can switch to the stock ICS browser that can use flash, but what happens when I&#8217;m on Jelly Bean and flash-less?</p>
<p>Warm Regards,<br />
DukeSilver</p>
<p>I believe they&#8217;re working on a video solution, and the current offering is only temporary.</p>
<p>Remember when the Verge had a horrible video player that was practically unusable? It was HTML5. Like the new, cool video player that actually works well? It&#8217;s Flash.</p>
<p>Though that I can&#8217;t watch anything in Chrome on my Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>That is a disadvantage. But its better that it works on most platforms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure neither one is that great, I have plenty of issues with the current one.</p>
<p>Well, okay, I&#8217;m not a huge fan really of the new one either, but the old one was absolutely horrible.</p>
<p>Google are great at giving the media time and generating positive PR. Their competitors are too arrogant and  cold to do this type of stuff. Their loss.</p>
<p>webos did a great job at this.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s up with Duarte&#8217;s shirt?!!</p>
<p>Does Josh always invite the people he interviews to experiment in his hotel room?</p>
<p>That joke about Josh plating with his new 7inch thing in his hotel room for a while the previous night was outright funny&#8230;.</p>
<p>I struggle with his constant reiteration of &#8220;no compromises&#8221;.  Let&#8217;s just list them off:</p>
<p>1) Targeted at content consumption, not creation<br />
2) No micro SD (was on the previous incarnation from Asus, pulled to save money)<br />
3) No HDMI (again, on the previous Asus model, but removed)</p>
<p>In fact <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/28/3124041/asus-me370t-nexus-7-transformation-google-nvidia">this article</a> is pretty much a recount of the compromises made to get the tablet under $200.  Compared to the Kindle Fire, there are FAR less compromises.  I just found it strange that he kept harping on that phrase when Microsoft is using that same phrase to mean &#8220;the full PC experience on a tablet&#8221; &#8212; which incidentally brings about a different set of compromises.</p>
<p>Maybe I am goring weary of the phrase altogether, because every design decision you make is about a trade off (or compromise).  Each design should be targeted at a different sweet spot.  The Nexus 7 has a sweet spot but represents a huge set of compromises for another type of user.</p>
<p>no comprises doesnt mean add everything and the kitchen sink</p>
<p>I think the only thing that seems odd is the removal of HDMI out. It kinda seems like a good selling point, but I wonder what kind of use-rate those ports even get on most tablets/phones.</p>
<p>HDMI would have required additional licenses resulting in driving the price up.  They kept the base model cheap and will likely provide HDMI via a dock accessory.</p>
<p>Smart move, imo.</p>
<p>So, in other words, a compromise was made to keep the price down.</p>
<p>First off, I am going to recommend your post because YOU ARE CORRECT.  But I never said that you have to &#8220;throw in everything but the kitchen sink&#8221; to be able to declare &#8220;no compromises&#8221;.  Throwing in everything but the kitchen sink ALSO introduces some compromises.  Everything has compromises.</p>
<p>- iPad compromises portability for screen real estate<br />
- iOS compromises flexibility for ease of use and support<br />
- Android compromises seamless built-in integration for third-party extensibility <br />
- Galaxy SIII compromises one-handed use for more usable screen real estate<br />
- iPhone 4S compromises usable screen real-estate for portability and one-handed use<br />
- MacBook Air compromises processing power for portability and battery life<br />
- Kindle Fire compromises processing power for price and media-consumption focus<br />
- Windows 8 RT compromises the desktop experience for better battery life, performance, and security on ARM</p>
<p>I could go on and on.  I just feel that this constant usage of &#8220;no compromise&#8221; is getting ridiculous.  Microsoft jumped on the phrase and now to hear Duarte repeating it in a different context hurts my ears.  Everything has a trade-off, to believe otherwise is fooling yourself.</p>
<p>I bought a Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover for iPad a few months ago.  It gets me over the hurdle for the &#8220;iPad has no keyboard compromise&#8221;; however it introduces compromises on portability and awkwardness when using the iPad (much like the Surface keyboard will).  Incidentally the Surface keyboard compromises lap-usage while letting you flip it around the back of the tablet for easy storage.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certain there are Asus Transformer owners who look at the Nexus 7 and say &#8220;that&#8217;s nice, but I prefer my huge 10-inch screen with massive resolution and I will just wait for the Jelly Bean update&#8221;.  They are willing to sacrifice price for a tablet that provides more of other features.</p>
<p>I hope my point is more clear now.  I am hardly one to say that you should include everything in order to target everyone.  That would be the worst product ever.</p>
<p>I see what you&#8217;re saying. I think what Duarte means when he says no compromises is that you get a full-featured Jellybean experience, you don&#8217;t really lose functionality compared to other tablets, or at least very little. I think comparing the tablet to say, a laptop, is stretching what he means too far. I guess you&#8217;re still right, but I think &#8216;no compromises&#8217; has to be taken more in the context of what&#8217;s being delivered: you don&#8217;t really lose anything that you would have got had you gone 10&quot;.</p>
<p>I completely agree. Its another tech buzz word like double down, and magical.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s hardware, not really JellyBean.</p>
<p>You want hdmi? Use an MHL adapter.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t work, doesn&#8217;t support MHL.<br />
<del>- Unable to find source, red it yesterday somewhere -</del></p>
<p>Read the same in the Anandtech review (too lazy to link).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine with an HDMI adaptor.  But plenty of folks have told me how silly I was for buying an iPad which lacks an HDMI output and SD card slot when Apple sells an adaptor for each (both of which I happen to own).  These folks felt the compromise was not worth it.  Others may feel at a certain price point its not an acceptable compromise, but at a lower price point it is.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always acknowledged that no HDMI on iPad is a compromise because it requires an adaptor, but I am fine with that because if I am carrying an HDMI cable or even an HDMI to mini-HDMI adaptor then I might as well be carrying an Apple 30-pin-dock-to-HDMI adaptor.  Same goes for SD cards and importing photos to iPad.  Its something I need on vacation so I leave it in a pouch that always comes with me on trips.  No big deal, but still a compromise.  Another compromise is that Apple only lets the SD card adaptor work for photo import and not for files, but with things like DropBox and iCloud I am okay with this compromise (some apps can even do bluetooth file transfer).</p>
<p>Just saying there are compromises every where you look.  I think the compromises made on the Nexus 7 were the right ones to make a successful product, but to emphasize &#8220;no compromises&#8221; is silly.  I think RIM tried a variation on that same theme when they introduced the Playbook&#8217;s &#8220;Full Web Experience&#8221; with &#8220;Flash!&#8221;.  Things did not work out for them because the compromises they did make were in other areas which left the device crippled and confusing to most users.</p>
<p>I would argue that if a product is selling successfully then they likely have made the right combination of compromises and provided the right combination of features.  The Nexus 7 looks like it did what Amazon should have done with the Fire.  The Fire sold well around Christmas, but has reportedly trailed off.  I think the Nexus 7 will pickup where the Fire left off and take things to the next level for the 7-inch tablet market.  I also think Apple should put together a 7.85-inchiPad mini sooner rather than later.  I know that an iPad mini would be the perfect device for my three kids because it would run all the same apps I have for iPad and their current iPod touches.  If the Nexus 7 would run our collection of iOS apps or could be rooted to run iOS, I would likely buy three of them for my kids today.</p>
<p>No compromises that non-geeks care about.</p>
<p>1) Agree.  That said, in my opinion, any tablet is a compromise when it comes to content creation.</p>
<p>2) There has been no Nexus device since the Nexus One with MicroSD.  The Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus did fine without microSD.  Every iDevice has done fine without microSD slots.  It&#8217;s a Google Experience device.  They expect you to use Google&#8217;s services to store and manage your content.</p>
<p>3)  They probably did it for cost.  But it&#8217;s also like the microSD.  How many average Joes care?  I suspect that very  few people today have ever used HDMI from their phone.  I&#8217;ve used Android for 2.5 years and I never have.  And I&#8217;m a little more tech savvy than most.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only two compromises that really matter when it comes to tablets. The first is screen quality.  The second is battery life.  The Nexus 7 nailed them both.</p>
<p>I understand all your points. I just wished android fans were so reasonable when talking about Apple compromises. They keep bashing iPad for no HDMI, no MicroSD, etc.</p>
<p>No MicroSD is probably the only annoyance for this tablet. HDMI use is edge case, and the creation vs. consumption thing can be applied to all tablets&#8230; it really depends on applications.</p>
<p>I love Matias&#8217; shirts</p>
<p>Hey Verge! less flash, more youtube!</p>
<p>They need this player to include their advertiser&#8217;s clips at the beginning and end of videos. Youtube has ads, but they&#8217;re advertising through Youtube, not The Verge.</p>
<p>Apparently, a flash-less version is in the works, but this is a stop-gap solution. And as far as I can tell, this particular player is somewhat common in the advertising-blogosphere. I think I&#8217;ve seen it used on a few music blogs I follow.</p>
<p>Obilgatory the videoplayer sucks comment.</p>
<p>I love what Matias said, one design philosophy for all apps that can scale to any screen size.</p>
<p>I like how principled he is, but I can&#8217;t see it working for truly complex apps.</p>
<p>For example look at Apple&#8217;s iPhoto, Keynote and so on, on iPhone and iPad. The UI is completely re-thought for interacting at those two sizes. It&#8217;s not scaled according to an auto-layout system, it just wouldn&#8217;t work. These apps have singular design philosophies, but the implementations are essentially two separate projects that each value their own use-case scenarios, goals, and workflows.</p>
<p>When you use an app on your phone, you approach it with different emotions — and often different goals — than you would when you approach it on a tablet. For example, you don&#8217;t tend to start large creative projects on your phone, but you would probably edit them. So your apps may even have a slightly different focus on different devices.</p>
<p>That said, a lot of simpler apps can adopt one design and scale to any screen size. Especially ones that just display content and don&#8217;t rely on complicated interaction.</p>
<p>Why the player is not HTML 5 like Youtube is?</p>
<p>I think it is HTML5, it seems to be working on my iPad, maybe check your setting on your device and make sure you are receiving the mobile version of the site rather than the desktop version?&#8230;..</p>
<p>So&#8230;your fonts don&#8217;t display correctly in the stock Android browser, and your videos don&#8217;t work in Chrome.</p>
<p>Awesome interview, but there was some nigh-on-Bourne-style shakeycam at around 16:00! Other than that, great work/</p>
<p>Oh goody, another video interview i cant watch from The Verge cause they still us flash&#8230; WTF</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t install Flash on my Mac, but I have a hotkey to open the current page in Chrome when Flash is needed.  This allows me to quit Flash by quitting Chrome when I am done viewing the Flash content.  The Verge is making me use that hotkey-enabled Chrome-launching script more often than not.  Kinda sad since there are so many better ways to view video on the Web.  I&#8217;m surprised its not working for folks on Chrome in Android&#8230;. maybe the Verge is not recognizing the User Agent, because they typically serve up HTML-5 to my iPad for this stuff.  I just wish I could get their servers to give me HTML-5 in desktop Safari.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s painful to watch Josh interview Matias &#8211; way too much brown nosing. Seriously.</p>
<p>I think Matias is the man of this relationship.  Josh is a bit submissive with Matias. Bromance?</p>
<p>Bromance? Brown nosing?</p>
<p>FYI guys: this is a tech culture web site not a bigotry forum.</p>
<p>No bigotry in the phrase &#8220;brown nosing&#8221;.  The phrase has been used for years with no bigotry intended.  He&#8217;s just saying that Josh idolizes Duarte a bit too much &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure I agree, but I don&#8217;t think Digeratti is displaying any sort of bigotry.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be right BC2009 &#8211; absolutely no bigotry intended. Just my observation of the interaction between the two.  Josh does seem like a bit of a kiss arse &#8211; again absolutely no bigotry intended with that expression.  Seriously .. the oohs and awes about the hardware seemed quite forced in my opinion.  If Josh agreed so much &#8211; maybe he would have mentioned the quality of the hardware and thoughtful design on his own .. or one would think.</p>
<p>I think josh is just being respectful.</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s my point, he is noticeably more <strong>respectful</strong> when interviewing Matias compared his interviews with John Gruber or Joe Belfiore or Stephen Elop.</p>
<p>it does appear that way. but to be fair, mattias is a nice guy&#8230;the other guys are kind of dicks or at the very least rather douchey.</p>
<p>This ain&#8217;t 60 minutes, Waldo.</p>
<p>Bromance</p>
<p>bigotry is lame bro</p>
<p>Matias is just a very easy guy to talk to and IMO it looks like Matias enjoys talking with Josh. As far as the Hardware is concerned I wish there was sd card storage, I&#8217;m a real nut for storage on anything. What most people don&#8217;t realize is you can add storage by just plug into the USB a simple adapter. You would obviously have to carry it around with you but it could be used to hold tons of stuff. For 200 bucks there is allot there.</p>
<p>The Nexus One is the only Nexus device to have ever had an SD card.  This stems from the fact that people usually tend to put cheap SD cards, with slow read and write speeds, into their devices and this would compromise the user experience.</p>
<p>I think most people like being interviewed by Josh/The Verge.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 is very hackable, to me that is the best part. The ability to hack this hardware will take it to so many different levels. To me that is why I enjoy Android. It isn&#8217;t a boring piece of hardware that you can not do anything with. It is Hackable and hacking is fun.</p>
<p>Love how proud matias is when he talks about the design of a product</p>
<p>I liked the attitude towards the feeling that the Nexus 7 being regarded as a consumption device &#8211; know it already, but it is nice to have one of the primary figures in the development confirm it.</p>
<p>Because Twitter&#8217;s Android App&#8217;s design is based on the iOS design</p>
<p>Well it is really based off of Twitters website. So everything just looks like the website but I see what you are saying. #HoloTheme</p>
<p>Great interview JTops</p>
<p>Great Interview: I liked this and the Nexus 7 review so much that I wrote about it on my blog:</p>
<p><a href="http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html" target="_blank">http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html</a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use the comments to promote your blog.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t seem to have any problems watching it on an ipad. And as much as I want to like what Google is doing with their more immediate services (Now as opposed to Glass, for instance), Matias just says,&#8220;The more we learn about you&#8221; or &#8220;The more sources of information we&#8217;re able to get about you&#8221; a bit too much to feel at ease with their products. I understand their revenue scheme, I understand that (based on their keynote) Google+ seems to be their primary product now, I know that no one is forcing anyone to sign up for their services. However, I want to like some of these products, I really do. They just make them sound a bit too creepy and invasive.</p>
<p>Yep.  Doesn&#8217;t surprise me that the #1 new feature in Jelly Bean is a way to perform MORE google searches.  Searches that run automatically for you so the information is just there when you need it.  Their true colors shine through.</p>
<p>Just a prediction, Key Lime Pie will result in tweaks to Google Now that provide even MORE searching automatically.  More of your information sent to google.  I can&#8217;t help but think of that scene in Batman Forever when Jim Carey is sitting in his lair and everyone&#8217;s information is just streaming to his brain from their cable boxes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s getting to the stage where I roll my eyes and skip the comments every time I see an iOS vs Android argument. In surprised you have enough time to enjoy your devices with the amount of time you waste reiterating the same trite..</p>
<p>Matias is consistently the coolest interview subject at Google.</p>
<p>You said it yourself Mattias&#8230;. The Fire and the Nexus7 was WAY smaller than the iPad..<br />
So why would anyone do a custom Android UI for Tablets&#8230; 10 inch tablets on Android suck. So&#8230; the answer is &#8216;No&#8217; this won&#8217;t kickstart any new development, because the Nexus 7 is about the same size as a Game Gear. People will just run Android phone apps on this.</p>
<p>Whenever he started talking about the hardware I would have said &#8220;Where the hell is the microSD slot?&#8221;</p>
<p>Licencing to Sandisk costs a few dollars more, you&#8217;ve got GDrive, DropBox, iCloud, SkyDrive, SugarSync etc you&#8217;re ok; since you&#8217;ll almost always be connected any-hows. It shouldn&#8217;t a deal breaker.</p>
<p>But most users, I believe, won&#8217;t &#8220;almost always be connected&#8221; via Wifi. Maybe at home/cafe/campus, but at work? In the car?</p>
<p>I agree.<br />
It&#8217;s not a bad interview, but the interviewer seemed to be pandering to Matias, who at one point steered the &#8220;interview&#8221; to publicise his own agenda.<br />
Fair enough, they seem like nice guys but he agreed mainly as an advertising platform. Please ask the questions that your audience would like asked, eg. reasons for no video out/no sd card slot.<br />
We can all make assumptions as to these, which may be correct, but it would be interesting to know the &#8220;public&#8221; reason from a designer,<br />

<p>Yeah, when he said &#8220;no compromises&#8221; I thought uuuh what? The N7 looks pretty great, it&#8217;ll sell like hotcakes, but no microsd is a massive compromise, especially when 16gb is the max configuration.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bore me with cloud cloud cloud, to that I say phone signal, low quality streaming video/audio, this is the era of HD please and thank you.</p>
<p>The compromise on the Nexus 7 is that they won&#8217;t be making any profit on device sales.  But that&#8217;s great for consumers!!!</p>
<p>You should interview the guy from Windows Phone, seems like an interesting character like Matias</p>
<p>That was cool. I&#8217;m really contemplating selling my iPad for a nexus 7. That tablet looks amazing. Google now is going to be a very interesting platform. I think this is what google glasses is all about. I really love android right now!</p>
<p>wow, I want to like that guy, but I can&#8217;t stand him.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t help when he said &#8220;developers have there heads in the sand&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think the thing I don&#8217;t like most of all, is he is subtly pointing out every way they are different from the iPad, and then explaining in a pompous way why there point of view is the right one for the future.</p>
<p>I can get that level of arrogance if they were dominating the market, but you are a small player in the tablet market. Acting like you have all the answers, and your competition is clueless is not a wise approach.</p>
<p>Um it is totally true though.  It is easy for twitter to make two separate apps for IOS because it is just 3.5 inches and 9.7 inches.  With Android, windows, and web pages there are so many different sizes and resolutions that scaling is the only proper way to do it. So basically the people complaining about the perfectly functional twitter app on Android tablets are retarded beyond belief.</p>
<p>It is all true. What exactly did he say that didn&#8217;t make sense? He nailed it and was totally ready for the Apple fanboy Josh criticisms.</p>
<p>How can you say Josh is an Apple Fanboy. Will you be happy when he carries a Nexus 7, Galaxy Nexus and Nexus Q?&#8230;..</p>
<p>&#8220;So basically the people complaining about the perfectly functional twitter app on Android tablets are retarded beyond belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>The iPad is better so why are people &#8220;retarded&#8221;? Because Android runs in multiple resolutions? Why should they care about that, from a consumer perspective the app is just worse. The technical reasons are irrelevant.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the advantage of having few formats. Compromise. Google compromises App quality by supporting all resolutions. Apple compromises size variety for app custom design.</p>
<p>&#8220;The iPad is better so why are people "retarded"? &quot; should read &quot;The iPad TWITTER APP is better so why are people "retarded"?</p>
<p>Developers most certainly don&#8217;t have their heads in the sand.</p>
<p>They have their heads in the money, which is currently available in Apple&#8217;s App Store.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Josh and a huge fan of Matias. Bring them together for a discussion and I&#8217;m just totally engaged. Android is in a fantastic place right now.  I love their software. I love their hardware. I love their culture. Keep up the great work Matias and co. We&#8217;re really enjoying your work.</p>
<p>I loved watching this interview. Matias is such a great man, I was crazy excited when he was hired by google, as I always loved the look and feel of the webOS interface and with holo he and his team actually delivered. I have had an android phone (desire) since 2.1 but lately I was hating everything about it, then ics came and I was stunned by what he did, finally android has a cohesive design language throughout the os, and app developers now can actually follow design guidelines. I&#8217;m telling you, if it wasn&#8217;t for matias and holo, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have stayed on the android bandwagon, I simply love my gnexus now, it&#8217;s the best phone I&#8217;ve ever had and looking at the interface of my iPad I just can&#8217;t stop thinking how much it&#8217;s becoming.. well.. silly, with the fake leather and the stupid glossy stuff and worst thing is they&#8217;re bringing it on to the Mac now and I must say it&#8217;s driving me crazy; I love my macbook, but I&#8217;m seriously considering a w8 laptop or a x86 surface as my next pc, metro is just great and I love the fact that holo and metro share some philosphy in the design with the flat and information rich style, moreover, in the case of the surface, I can really see why MS realized w8 in that way, I&#8217;d be great to have 1 device that does essentially replace the pc and the tablet. Ok now I&#8217;m OT but I hope you got my point.</p>
<p>20 minutes interview, with not much visual content.<br />
Could you make this kind of content available as an <em>audio</em> podcast, please?</p>
<p>Good interview Josh, thank you.</p>
<p>Its unfortunate that Matias was too busy for a longer interview, josh and him always have a good banter and seem to have good interview chemistry.  Hopefully there will be a longer interview once I/O is over? And josh can get down to the nitty gritty on all the new hardware</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t hear the video at the moment but still am not a fan of Mathias. He tends to talk on too much about things that NEVER translate into the product execution. I&#8217;ll listen once i get home.</p>
<p>Was looking forward to a new flamboyant shirt on Matias.</p>
<p>What a great guy.</p>
<p>PS: Still waiting for high Res contact pictures&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh big foul by Matias!!</p>
<p>Just because you grew up with something doesn&#8217;t necessarily good.</p>
<p>I grew up with the internet on XVGA screens. Guess what, I&#8217;m not going back to those.</p>
<p>The fuck? I paused the video and clicked to resume and it restarted. :/</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really exciting to see how enthused Matias is about Android and Design. There&#8217;s bean such a tangible change in the quality of Android since he came on board and it&#8217;s great to hear how his thoughts on things.</p>
<p>It was particularly interesting to learn the amount of thought that went into the shape of the Nexus 7 and his ideas about good UI and how it scales to fit various screens. Whether or not you like Google+ I really do think that the Android app itself puts pretty much any other social network app to shame in it&#8217;s slickness and usability.</p>
<p>Does the Nexus 7 looks like iPad 3? only in plastic and 7 inch? Looks the same to me</p>
<p>Totally! Both are flat, have a screen on the front and none on the back. They&#8217;re basicly equal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been screaming on the rooftops for two years now 10in is too big &amp; heavy for a tablet. So glad someone who can make a difference feels the same. The flyer is what could have been, HTC missed the mark on weight.</p>
<p>I guess the 60 million people who bought iPads while multiple 7&quot; models sat on the shelf couldn&#8217;t hear you.  These people probably value little things like being able to type with two hands and view full web pages and magazine pages without pinching and zooming.  Or maybe they don&#8217;t see the need to carry both a 5&quot; smartphone and  a 7&quot; &#8220;tablet&#8221;.  Apple tested different tablet sizes in their labs for years before concluding that 9.7&quot; was the best size compromise.  What is your opinion based on?</p>
<p>Love The Verge!!</p>
<p>Just started watching the video.  First thoughts &#8211; Matias needs to cut those fingernails.  Yikes.</p>
<p>Mattes are not cut as symmetrically. That actually takes away from th piece being shown. The purpose of a matte is to protect the surface of the artwork from the glass of the frame.</p>
<p>That and the bezel he talked about simply makes the tablet look like a big iPhone.</p>
<p>Exactly. Frame mattes aren&#8217;t always asymmetrical like it&#8217;s a rule. It just happens to be some time. Just listening to Duarte talk about the bezel as if it is the epitome of industrial design made me queazy.</p>
<p>Great interview Josh. Keep up the good work guys.</p>
<p>what is it with his shits? God he must live in hawaii or something</p>
<p>Why?  They have pineapple pieces in them?</p>
<p>Josh, can you do a follow up article with Matias on why they decided to use the phone ui for the Nexus 7 in stead of the traditional honeycombish style layout? Considering he is the head software designer for android, im sure he would have had great insight onto why they decided to unify both tablet and phone versions.</p>
<p>Because the Nexus 7 is just a giant Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We waged a war on lagginess&#8221; &#8211; Matias Duarte</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQdfGFK5XQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQdfGFK5XQ</a></p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Ahhh.. I hate flash on my mobile.  Why can&#8217;t I watch these videos on my android phone or tablet without flash ??? It seems to work fine on an iOS device without flash !!  And now that Adobe is not supporting mobile flash any more (thank GOD !!), can everyone please support non flash videos on their website.. Thanks :)</p>
<p>I think Google knows that whenever they have a big release, they have to let Josh talk to Matias.<br />
Then they get raving positive reviews written.<br />
Such brolove.</p>
<p>Matias Duarte is to Google what Jonathan Ives is to Apple.</p>
<p>i appreciate the sentiment, but the similarity is only that they are the highest profile designers at each company. the biggest distinction is that jony is an industrial designer which means he designs the physical hardware, whereas matias works on the software side as anUI/UX designer. by his own admission, if jony was in charge of UI, he would have gotten rid of all the god-awfu,l out-dated skeuomorphic design elements like the leather and fabric textures used in ios.</p>
<p>Love these interviews with Duarte, good work!</p>
<p>God what did Google do to this guys Fashion Sense?</p>
<p>Then-Palm</p>

<p>HOLY CRAP! STAY THE F AWAY FROM MOUNTAIN VIEW</p>
<p>I actually like the floral shirt. Maybe it may not look great on him, but the rosy shirt ain&#8217;t bad.  The shirt he&#8217;s wearing at top of page (white with gray splotches) is rather bland.  The shirt he&#8217;s wearing up above with Palm logo screams tech geek&#8230;  rather have a bit of funk than look like a total IT dork.</p>
<p>The dude looks like he plays a little to much GTA: Vice City  and watching Miami Vice marathons on the weekends. If it wasn&#8217;t for is outstanding work on webOS I would not trust him to handle and design elements at all.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a gadget pimp.</p>
<p>When you have talent and deliver the goods to customers you can wear whatever you want.</p>
<p>WTF is this???</p>
<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0U1B0X2N1i1h1K1A3t2A/Screen%20Shot%202012-07-02%20at%201.55.48%20AM.png" /></p>
<p>My bullshit meter went full scale when Matias Duarte started speaking of the bezel design. I ordered an N7 anyway :-)</p>
<p>What is with his shirts?</p>
<p>Awesome and insightful interview. Now the design elements make sense, esp that complaints I had around the seemingly large bezel.</p>
<p>That man could be my gadget pimp any day.</p>
<p>Preordered  the base model.</p>
<p>The GPS chip with the other sensors means that this Nexus 7 can become the coolest portable navigation device ever at that $199 price point : say it with me 7 inch HD touch screen with state of the art Android and a bevy of sensors that give the iPad a run for the money at less than 1/2 the price.</p>
<p>Add in all of the other cool android features, the fact that they throw in a $25 google play credit with the preorder, and all of the great software that is forthcoming for this Kindel Fire crusher of a tablet!</p>
<p>I am a full on Apple Fan, but watching this interview and reading about the Nexus 7 in more detail made a convincing enough argument along with that uber low price point to justify a spot on well considered preorder.</p>
<p>Win!</p>
<p>How is it that he can design such awesome UIs and OS elements, but dresses and styles himself like that. The guy just looks absurd and totally style-less.  I don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Looking good Josh , great reveiw</p>
<p>you cant be serious,wow going all out google</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why this is surprising to you at al</p>
<p>After Samsung forks Android, the OS after Key Lime Pie and Licorice  will be MoogleOS</p>
<p>Marzipan comes after Licorice</p>
<p>Hell no. Moon Pie!</p>
<p>Moon Pie isn&#8217;t a bad guess. They never repeat akronyms and we haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;MP&#8221; yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure about Licorice.. Lemon Meringue Pie is more likely.</p>
<p>We could have three &#8220;Pies&#8221; in a row.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it a trademark? Jello could never have been an option for the same reason</p>
<p>I&#8217;m stuck on Key Lime Pie, only option I could ever think it would be. Doesn&#8217;t have a great ring to it though mind.</p>
<p>Kola cubes?</p>
<p>Klondike Bar!!! _</p>
<p>No&#8230;.. one word why: Patents</p>
<p>Secondly though, a Klondike Bar is pretty much an Ice Cream Sandwich&#8230;.</p>
<p>did you mean trademarks?</p>
<p>Yes&#8230;.<img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nYt8B_I4R2s/ScnO2nc6LXI/AAAAAAAADY0/tUT8I3dazIE/s400/Picture043-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>and an eclair is pretty much a donut. who cares if they are similar. <br />
i know it&#8217;ll never happen though due to trademarks.</p>
<p>Disagree. Elcair donuts are not actually éclairs. It&#8217;s very different.</p>
<p>&#8220;an eclair is pretty much a donut&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you deranged? A donut is essentially a ring-shaped piece of fried dough. An eclair is a flat, soft pastry filled with cream and topped with chocolate.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t tell that to the French!! You could get arrested for comparing a Parisien dessert to an <i>American arterial wall liner&lt;\i&gt;</i></p>
<p>No I&#8217;m not deranged. I&#8217;m a culinary school graduate actually. I know a lil&#8217; about food. Donuts are not always round. :P</p>
<p>My point was they are both pastries. I can go to the store and see many soft, flat pastires filled with cream and topped with chocolate&#8230; and they are donuts.</p>
<p>Kiwi Cheesecake:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.cantinhodosdoces.co.uk/photos/sobremesas/STA71995.JPG" /></p>
<p>You know I was serious hoping for Android Kheer.</p>
<p>Wikipedia it. It&#8217;s definitely more popular and widely known than Key Lime Pie.</p>
<p>If you immediately realized you&#8217;d have to tell people to wiki it, I question its popularity.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right.</p>
<p>Still Android Jalebi and Android Kheer would be awesome.</p>
<p>Or you know Android Kalakand&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have a Jalebi please.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what it was until I looked, but then realised I had it last night at an Indian restaurant. They just called it rice pudding tho, but it was one of the best desserts I&#8217;ve ever had!</p>
<p>I really want some kheer now. You&#8217;re making me miss home.</p>
<p>Even am rooting for kheer or you know kulfi :P</p>
<p>Me too! That would be amazing but I wouldn&#8217;t count on it. It&#8217;s not like as if we saw android Barfi, Falooda, Gajrela or Halwa so hey. Lassi would be good, everyone knows what Lassi is right?</p>
<p>Oh man, I could go for a mango lassi right about now&#8230;</p>
<p>A Chinese delicacy??  <i>   &#8230;what?</i></p>
<p>Ice Cream Sandwich doesn&#8217;t exactly roll off the tongue.</p>
<p>And if we we were supposed to install ICS in our mouth that&#8217;d be a problem</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, most users are still stuck on Gingerbread, and a lot of them even on Froyo.</p>
<p>not like theirs that many deserts with K</p>
<p>Yeah and I feel like the names are slowly becoming less appetizing. Ice Cream Sandwich was the peak of deliciousness.</p>
<p>Improvement over Honeycomb.</p>
<p>Honeycomb is awesome! Have you ever had a Crunchie bar?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen Crunchies on sale in two years of living in the US, so I guess most here haven&#8217;t</p>
<p>It is available in the US. You&#8217;re seriously missing out. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunchie" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunchie</a></p>
<p>Then they should just name the next one Vagina.</p>
<p>Yep, they should switch to something much more boring like common types of large cats.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought that Google&#8217;s desert theme was chosen deliberately to contrast with Apple&#8217;s pretentious cat names. Snow leopard, seriously?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard of the Ice Cream Sandwich Desert. <br />
Actually, I haven&#8217;t heard of any deserts with the same name as the Android code names.</p>
<p>You make it sound like there was something wrong with being educated? Not to forget at ICS stand you get ICS &#8211; not just name  :)</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t heard of cupcakes?  Or donuts?  Or eclairs, or gingerbread?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really Google&#8217;s fault.  There was something <em>terribly</em> wrong with your childhood.  I blame the parents.  Probably fed you healthy food.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s referring to the fact that  reverent_t misspelled desserts as deserts dude</p>
<p>I&#8230; am so slow.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put a positive spin on this: I&#8217;m obviously a generous person who doesn&#8217;t get snarky about spelling.  I didn&#8217;t get this joke because I&#8217;m too <em>nice</em>.</p>
<p>That must be it&#8230;</p>
<p>:/</p>
<p>Upvote &#8216;cause I fell in the same trap <del><em>_</em></del>&#8217;</p>
<p>Upvoted because this actually made me laugh out loud.  :)</p>
<p>You forgot the &#8220;/sarcasm&#8221; tag&#8230;.. right?</p>
<p>Or have you lived in a cave for the past 100 years?</p>
<p>No, he&#8217;s been living the Sahara dessert.</p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>Oh I see what you did there&#8230; :)</p>
<p>Desert themes are generally, arid,  not much vegetation except for cacti and may or may not have sandy soil; Google Android fits none of these descriptions.  What are you talking about?</p>
<p>How is a ferocious large cat more pretentious than a Vista? Or a dessert? Your anti-Apple tattoos are showing through your shirt.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear of Apple&#8217;s Big Cat names, it reminds me of people who wear leopard-print because they think it&#8217;s fiece. That, and I can&#8217;t help but think of Derek Zoolander. Next Mac OSX should be called &#8220;Le Tigre.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>I’ve always thought that Google’s desert theme was chosen deliberately to contrast with Apple’s pretentious cat names. Snow leopard, seriously?</blockquote>
<p>Really? You think that Google names their mobile OS versions in response to Apple&#8217;s desktop OS names?  If that were true it would be really silly and kind of pathetic. And by the way, what is pretentious about cat names?  Lion, Tiger, Panther, Leopard, etc.  They&#8217;re only pretentious if you project that onto them because of your bias against Apple.</p>
<p>Pretentious? The numbering for iOS versions must really get to you.  Who brought up Apple anyways?</p>
<p>Then again.  Maybe you are right, and everything Google does is response to Apple? <br />

<p>It&#8217;s a PERFECT COPY!</p>
<p>Next apple will be sueing the inventors of the Ice cream sandwhich dessert for dress suit! :)</p>
<p>Apple should sue&#8230; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve thought about it.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t sure if serious, but your posting history seems to suggest that you&#8217;re actually this defensive to believe an Ice Cream Sandwich, which has predated the iPhone for decades, somehow ripped off Apple.</p>
<p>Really? Big cat&#8217;s are pretentious? That&#8217;s just silly.</p>
<p>Le Tigre, Blue Steel, Magnum</p>
<p>Right. Because there are so many uncommon types of large cats roaming around.</p>
<p>Nobody seen the infamous Fire Breathing Rainbow Lion ?</p>
<p>Actually, there are quite a few types of large cats:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae</a></p>
<p>Instead, Apple has picked the most common, boring ones.</p>
<p>Mr. Lion begs to differ. He wants to know if you will think he is boring when he is chewing on your face. Nom.</p>
<p>The problem with naming it Lion is you really don&#8217;t have anywhere to go but down, from a marketing/psychological point of view, unless that name was chosen deliberately.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that most things Apple does are deliberate. Also, the names don&#8217;t have to go <strong>forever</strong>.</p>
<p>Yep I think OS Chinese Mountain Cat sounds much more interesting.</p>
<p>Why do you have to bring Apple into this discussion?  Does every single Google discussion have to turn into some silly competition against Apple? And why are names of desserts and confections inherently superior to names of big cats?  And who really cares?</p>
<p>Because&#8230; um&#8230; big cats can eat desserts but not vice versa?</p>
<p>Why would a big cat eat jelly beans?</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s an obvious parallel and comparison. And obviously you cared enough about the topic of OS names that you clicked your way into the article. I&#8217;ll never understand why people post to say that they don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>I am interested in the topic of Android so I read the article.  I am certainly not interested in turning everything into an Apple/Google pissing contest, which was the point of my comment.</p>
<p>Or what about numbers (MS) or old ass women names (Nokia)</p>
<p>Yes, because nothing tops the great numbering scheme Nokia used in the late 90s. 5110, 5510, 7210, 5330, 8310, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>I personally can not wait for Zebra Cakes</p>

<p>Please please please, as a New Zealander, please call it &#8220;Kiwifruit&#8221; :-)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwifruit" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwifruit</a></p>
<p>Kiwi is the most well known NZ native bird,</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi</a></p>
<p>And also a name for the people of New Zealander, New Zealanders are still sometimes called &#8220;kiwis&#8221;.  There is no plural s in the native Maori (marr ree) language, so multiple birds are still Kiwi, &#8220;kiwis&#8221; is said of multiple New Zealand people :-)</p>
<p>What about changing midcourse to New Zealand native birds Google?</p>
<p>My vote goes to Kakapo</p>

<p>Lemon Meringue Pie. Especially if it&#8217;s a more iterative update from KLP.</p>
<p>Perhaps Licorice. Maybe not though, most probably don&#8217;t know how to spell it (and there are 2 accepted spellings, which makes for even more confusion).</p>
<p>I had never even heard of Eclair or Froyo before Android, so Licorice wouldn&#8217;t exactly be pushing the envelope</p>
<p>You&#8217;d never heard of <em>éclair?</em> What planet are you from?</p>
<p>These things are sooo good! This thread is going to make me gain 10 pounds just reading it&#8230;</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t called eclairs everywhere.</p>
<p>The it should be called fried dough filled with cream or FDFWC to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never heard of Frozen Yogurt?</p>
<p>FroYo is actually no that widespread. You&#8217;ll find it hard getting any in Europe.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s actually pretty easy to get one in Italy ;)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely not called frozen yoghurt. Having spent a lot of time in gelaterias it failed to leave an impression of being there. But I do remember that there was yoghurt something there&#8230;</p>
<p>Plus the abbreviation is a total unknown to people across the Atlantic (as far as I remember)</p>
<p>Do you live under a rock?</p>
<p>Where the hell do you live, and are you 5 years old?</p>

<p>Lemon Ice Cream Sandwiches</p>
<p>&#8216;Lager&#8217;</p>
<p>My usual desert of choice.</p>
<p>I usually prefer the Sahara, but sometimes if I want a change I&#8217;ll go for the Gobi.</p>
<p>Really? Lager is a terrible dessert beer. I&#8217;d usually go for a stout or lambic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing the OP is English and therefore drinks in excess regularly simply to get intoxcated (or &#8216;shitfaced&#8217; &#8211; as it&#8217;s more commonly called). You, I would guess, appear to be from more civilised place.</p>
<p>Thanks for the sermon Reverend.</p>
<p>how is that a sermon?</p>
<p>Well if you are going to get all pedantic about it, if I had the choice I would go for Schneider Weisse Tap 6 (Unser Aventinus), but that doesn&#8217;t begin with &#8216;L&#8217; ;-)</p>

<p>How many points do i get? :)</p>
<p>Damn it, now I want Key Lime Pie, to eat.</p>
<p>Obviously Google would make more money if they sell these delicious sweets, than making mobile OS.</p>
<p>If they sold sweets, the sweets themselves would be free, but would include ads for Google to make money.</p>
<p>But the dessert manufacturers would add their own frosting to &#8220;differentiate&#8221; and ruin the dessert flavor.</p>
<p>Frosting should always be optional. I prefer my pie stock.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget modding community. And you can always bake one of your own using the recipe found on AOSP source tree  :)</p>
<p>There are recipe trees now?</p>
<p>My favourite dessert!</p>

<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>defensive internet fanboy dick-wagging conest, blah blah blah, copy/paste response?  I&#8217;M SO CLEVER!!</p>
<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so good at internet!</p>
<p>Only one of the 3 of us got defensive enough to use personal insults and swear&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, Mr. Stupid! Is that better?</p>
<p>I repeat my previous statement.</p>
<p>Aw. There, there.</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;only one of the 3 of us seems to be getting defensive.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s Paula Dean&#8217;s job.</p>
<p>And we wonder why Americans are fat. . .</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Key Lime Pie? I&#8217;ve never heard of it :D</p>
<p>My preferred name would be Kahlua. No idea what it is, but it sounds awesome!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re being serious you really should try it (to both KLP and Kahlua).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seriously never heard of Key Lime Pie.</p>
<p>The Kahlua thing was kinda light hearted.</p>
<p>You should really try it, i honestly hate citrus flavored things , like all citrus flavored things EXCEPT key lime pie. its soo good.</p>
<p>How could a toucan hate citrus!?  <em>That makes no sense.</em></p>
<p>Key lime pie is very American, probably wont find anywhere else.</p>
<p>They sell it in Marks and Spencer in the UK.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve literally never seen it..although I don&#8217;t shop in M&amp;S.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just Android, this is M&amp;S Android :-)</p>
<p>You mean MS Android?</p>
<p>Wait&#8230;</p>
<p>go back to working on boid please ! lol</p>
<p>I am :)</p>
<p>Key lime pie is amazing&#8230; Try it. Kahlua not so good&#8230; Not bad in cocktails B52 I do believe?</p>
<p>Yup, as well as white and black russians.</p>
<p>You and the guy who hadn&#8217;t heard of Froyo and Eclairs need to get together and leave the house once and a while.</p>
<p>Pedantic point &#8211; &#8220;once in a while&#8221; not &#8220;once and a while&#8221;.</p>
<p>Erm&#8230;OK. I bet if asked my friends a family (my age &#8211; not Aunts or Uncles, or parents) they wouldn&#8217;t have heard of Key Lime Pie either.</p>
<p>I live in the UK &#8211; as someone said up there, it isn&#8217;t as well know here as it is in the US.</p>
<p>Hey, don&#8217;t hate on people just because the whole world isn&#8217;t a homogenised copy of the US. Variety is the spice of life&#8230;</p>
<p>I belt you&#8217;ve never seen or heard of these, which we also call eclairs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cadbury-Chocolate-Eclairs-180g-Pack/dp/B000KDZBT2" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Cadbury-Chocolate-Eclairs-180g-Pack/dp/B000KDZBT2</a></p>
<p>And the froyo thing is just mostly that people outside the US have never encoutered the abbreviation. Obviously the concept of freezing yoghurt as a substitute to ice cream is not difficult to grasp. On that subject, I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;d ever encountered ice cream sandwiches before moving to the US either&#8230;</p>
<p>As an Aussie, I&#8217;ve never heard of &#8216;Key Lime Pie&#8217;, but the other Kiwi-based stuff mentioned here, I&#8217;m well aware of. Please, don&#8217;t turn this into some conceited US-centric bullshit.</p>
<p>Living in South Florida, I can tell you that you are missing out.  A lot.  Key Lime Pie (as a simple wiki or google search would tell you), is a pie consisting of delicious sweetened condensed milk, other delicious stuff, and key lime juice.  OMG I KNOW WHAT I AM MAKING TODAYZ.</p>
<p>Are there any desserts that start with Z? Thinking ahead here . . .</p>
<p>Zigzag bar? Zebra cake?</p>
<p>I severely doubt that Google will continue to be making Android in 15 years much less keeping up the dessert name theme.  By then, the market will have changed and we&#8217;ll have all moved to greener pastures.  Smartphones will be ancient history.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a few years to create something and make it popular.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any of the mobile OSs in existence (iOS, Android, WP) are going to be around in 13-14 years, honestly.</p>
<p>Why do you not think they will exist? (assuming no zombie apocalypse alters our priorities, etc)</p>
<p>Windows NT is already overstaying it&#8217;s welcome after about&#8230;11? Although it&#8217;s been argued Vista was a substantial refresh, I doubt it. <br />
OS X should be severely rethought, even though the codebase is still solid, and at least finally retire the dependence on HFS+. That&#8217;s a piece of software that&#8217;s waaay overstayed it&#8217;s welcome. <br />
Linux needs to kill the X Window System.</p>
<p>Everything needs a good refresh every decade or so. The names will still be around, probably, but the code will get a nice through refresh. It&#8217;s just good practice. WinMo nearly died because of that, and BlackBerry pretty much did.</p>
<p>You will have to pull X-windows out of my cold dead hands!</p>
<p>Oookay.<br />
Are you just that used to it, or you don&#8217;t like the replacement candidates?</p>
<p>All other operating systems have compatibility issues.  I could never see myself running something other than Windows: especially for games.  I wouldn&#8217;t own a Mac if Apple paid me.</p>
<p>If Linux was more widely used, I wouldn&#8217;t mind giving it a shot.  &lt;3Android.</p>
<p>Funny, my Mac doesn&#8217;t have any &#8220;compatibility issues&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>But Windows NT is almost nineteen years old&#8230;</p>
<p>Or did you mean it started overstaying its welcome at aroundabout XP?<br />
In which case, uh&#8230;.<br />
Windows 7 is the first Windows release to get things mostly right.</p>
<p>Really? Oh, wow. That is really old. I never really looked that up, I just knew that XP was the first stable consumer release of that codebase. They took a long time on that, didn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>Vista was a very architectural refresh, which is why it had so many incompatibilities.</p>
<p>*a very deep architectural</p>
<p>Snow Leopard had massive changes underneath (but without Vista&#8217;s horridness).</p>
<p>Ehh well you see, I suppose you never met Lion right? :)</p>
<p>OSX doesn&#8217;t depend on HFS+. You can use ZFS if you wish.</p>
<p>The issue is that the benefits of ZFS and other file systems simply aren&#8217;t that useful for most people. Likewise more and more of our lives are being spent on the cloud/mobile devices.</p>
<p>ZFS is still immature.</p>
<p>HFS+ &gt; NTFS.</p>
<p>Sorry but thats not true. I really hope OS X will soon use a version of the HAMMER File system, now that ZFS is off the table :/.</p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s see. The G1 came out in 2009 so in three years we&#8217;ve gone from A to I, that&#8217;s 9 letters. So we&#8217;re just under one-third the way through the alphabet. If they keep going at the same pace, we&#8217;ll be at Z it 6 years. As you say, given no zombie apocalypse has occurred in the meantime, I think Android will still be around in 6 years.</p>
<p>Correction: the G1 came out in October 2008. Still Ice Cream Sandwich launched around December of 2011 so I guess you could say it&#8217;s still 3 years.</p>
<p>I guess that leaves us roughly 17 more dessert codenamed releases of Android. At a generous accelerated  rate of two a year should they continue that pace, that&#8217;s nine years of Android dessert codenames.   How long do you think we&#8217;ll still be using Android?</p>
<blockquote>I don’t think any of the mobile OSs in existence (iOS, Android, WP) are going to be around in 13-14 years, honestly.</blockquote>
<p>Whether there&#8217;ll be OSes with those names or not, who knows&#8230; I bet those 3 companies will be making the most popular OSes though.</p>
<p>I wish I had seen this post before I made mine. :)</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d use an alcoholic drink&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>In other shocking news, iOS 6 coming after iOS 5. There are unconfirmed reports that iOS 7 will follow sometime in 2013.</p>
<p>Apple also has code names for iOS versions</p>

<p>At least they don&#8217;t label those names when they release them I guess LOL</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind that Android releases stay attached to their internal codenames. Sure it&#8217;s a bit silly, especially considering they are all dessert themed, but at the same time it adds a small personable touch. Or an odd sense of familiarity, and maybe a small sense of childish wonder. Who as a kid didn&#8217;t love any and all desserts?</p>
<p>I agree.  I think Google does a great job of keeping things light-hearted.  I love the little error messages I get, when Chrome crashes.  &#8220;He&#8217;s dead Jim.&#8221; &lt;3Twain!</p>

Then as if by magic, The Verge mentions it in the same hour for the second time in my life. WEIRD.</p>

<p>Kruller would have been nice.<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LzMAg_fMhbw/Si6K4F_WhnI/AAAAAAAAA5U/t8k3cOf9jAA/s320/dsc05620kruller.jpg" /><br />
Mmmmmmm&#8230;krullers.</p>
<p>Except that it&#8217;s usually spelled &#8220;cruller&#8221;.</p>
<p>Meh, I&#8217;ve seen it both ways. And really, who doesn&#8217;t like a good kruller (cruller)?</p>

<p>Honestly these names to me are just embarrassing,  I wish they&#8217;d come up with something else&#8230; oh well.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with them. Codenames used instead of version names make more sense. It&#8217;s much easier to call the latest version of Android Ice Cream Sandwich than it is to call it Android 4.0, just like its much easier to call the latest version of OS X Lion than it is to call it OS X 10.7.</p>
<p>Who is it embarassing? I think it shows that they&#8217;re having fun with it. Not just labeling them with numbers.</p>
<p>This is getting RIDICULOUS!&#8230;.</p>
<p>*5 agreed</p>
<p>Hopefully this will the &#8220;Fragmentation resolved Pie&#8221;</p>
<p>Fragmentation affects your downloading and running of apps in what way?</p>
<p>None at all. Now fragmentation off.</p>
<p>It affects your downloading and running of apps if you download and try to run an Android app that your Android hardware can&#8217;t support. I&#8217;ve run into this problem many times.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d not heard of this before it was mentioned in Dexter. That just makes it more awesome to me.</p>
<p>How come no one is aware of extremely common foods&#8230;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, not everyone lives in America.</p>
<p>Thank you. He just said pretty much the same thing to my comment.</p>
<p><em>To martonikaj</em> The US calls chocolate Candy. We call it chocolate. You call swede a turnip.The countries are different. We don&#8217;t eat the same food as you. Get over it.</p>
<p>We call chocolate chocolate too&#8230;</p>
<p>But am I right in saying some people call it Candy? Or is that something else?</p>
<p>People in the US use candy when the chocolate is just one ingredient of some kind of confectionery&#8230;like M&amp;M&#8217;s which is described here in the US as &#8216;chocolate candy&#8217;.  However, generally from what I hear and what I use all the time, chocolate by itself is just chocolate. I never heard of anyone referring to it only as candy (unless you&#8217;re a child).</p>
<p>Candy is a very broad term that includes all sorts of sweet treats, including what the British call lollies.</p>
<p>See above</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather answer I&#8217;m running Droid X whatever, or G-23 something to answer with when asked what is your phone or tablet running? Jelly Bean? Key Lime Pie, and get a NO I meant what platform or OS is your SMARTPHONE or TABLET ( as if I were deaf) running.</p>
<p>You still can. Just because ICS is called ICS doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t 4.0. There are version numbers as well as snacks.</p>
<p> *5 agreed</p>
<p>Not a good idea to use &#8220;lime&#8221; in the name since it will become &#8220;lame pie&#8221;.<br />
Funny how so fanboys are using fragmentation when it comes to everything..If anything, i don&#8217;t like it that they seem to be going at a 1/year pace now,. would rather see 2 per year. as long as they figure out a more streamlined way for everybody to update.</p>
<p>Everyone talks about Apple or fans? knocking Android. WHY bring Apple into this at all, then the conversations and comments drift in that direction&#8230;  This article had nothing to do with Apple, and I don&#8217;t like the name which has nothing to do with Apple or what word you loosely use  &#8220;fanboys&#8221; What do you call women who use or like Apple? I digress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fanboy&#8217;s&#8221; using fragmentation isn&#8217;t as a big of a deal as impartial developers citing it as a legitimate reason for not developing for the platform</p>
<p>That&#8217;s &#8220;fanboys&#8221;, &#8220;fanboy&#8221;.</p>
<p>And nowhere have I seen developers stating that OS version differentiation is a reason that they don&#8217;t develop for Android (since the API changes are minimal). If this were the case than the same would apply to iOS (since that has the same OS version differentiation).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you know what fragmentation means. It has nothing to do with OS versions but rather fragmentation of the hardware.  According to Andy Rubin there are over 800 different Android phones. It&#8217;s very difficult to program for such a vast array of different hardware configurations.</p>
<p>Is this really news worthy? They haven&#8217;t even announced Jelly Bean yet.</p>
<p><img src="https://skitch.com/e-chunkygeek/88yai/twitter-search-zpower-slow-news-day" /></p>
<p>Hence: &#8220;News&#8221;.</p>
<p>Been calling this for months! Only because I couldn&#8217;t&#8217; think of any other desert beginning with K.</p>
<p>dessert not a desert sorry my spellcheck failed</p>
<p>Called it.</p>
<p>For future reference, here&#8217;s my list of android versions:</p>
<p>Android<br />
Beta<br />
Cupcake<br />
Donut<br />
Eclair<br />
Froyo<br />
Gingerbread<br />
Honeycomb<br />
Ice Cream Sandwich<br />
Jelly Bean (I guessed Jell-o but was concerned with trademark issues)<br />
Key Lime Pie<br />
Lemon Square<br />
Marshmallow, or less likely: Melon<br />
Napoleon<br />
Oreo if it weren&#8217;t for trademark issues. Instead: Ostkaka.<br />
Pancake, Pannacotta, Piece of Cake, Pain au Chocolat, Pineapple, Pumpkin or Peppermint Patty. Lots of choices here&#8230;<br />
Q<br />
Rocky Road or Rice Pudding.<br />
Sundae or S&#8217;more. Perhaps Sachertorte.<br />
Tiramisu, Twinkie Toffee or Truffle<br />
U<br />
V<br />
Wedding Cake<br />
X<br />
Yogurt<br />
Zebra Cake</p>
<p>Q, U, V and X are beyond me.</p>
<p>A was Astro and B was Bender internally allegedly.</p>
<p>Futurama FTW!</p>
<p>Where&#8217;d you get that info from?  It&#8217;s always bothered me I didn&#8217;t know what A/B were &#8211; I&#8217;d always guessed A was &#8220;Android&#8221;.</p>
<p>I thought it was common knowledge? Just double checked and its on Wiki too</p>
<p>Vanilla Velvet Cake</p>
<p>Not too shabby.</p>
<p>Q  uince tarte tatin<br />
U  pside Down Orange Cake<br />
V  anilla Fudge<br />
X  anthan Gum Cake</p>
<p>Pancake? Pancakes are not dessert, sir.</p>
<p>They are cakes, aren&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>Neither is honeycomb or jelly beans or donuts. They are confections.</p>
<p>Once again, that depends upon which country you live in&#8230;</p>
<p>S = Spotted Dick</p>
<p>As an original G1 owner waiting till Spring, checking blogs for details on the original &#8220;Cupcake&#8221; update- its hard to believe the OS came this far and that they actually kept with the dessert naming scheme!</p>
<p>No KLPd please Google.</p>
<p>Should have been Kouig Aman !!!<br />
<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouign-amann" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouign-amann</a></p>
<p>Hooray for breton desserts !</p>
<p>Kaju Barfi FTW!</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaju_barfi" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaju_barfi</a></p>
<p>Google &#8211; &#8220;Our legal department requires us to inform you that despite the dessert names you should not eat our phones. Hear that? Whatever you do, do not eat the delicious phones.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one point Google will have to just stop using these dessert names for their phones &#8211; mainly because people without a sense of humour are starting to get pissed having to hold serious conversations about dessert named softwares.</p>
<p>If it bothers you that much why not just use the version numbers?</p>
<p>clearly neither of you (Dis and Mart) can read.</p>
<p>Why would you actually get mad about having to use these names? There are more important things to worry about lol.</p>
<p>What happens when they run out of desserts?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll move on to entrees. &#8220;Android 26, codenamed Samosa&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as long as they don&#8217;t use the word &#8220;entrée&#8221;, which means appetiser in its original language &#8211; that would REALLY confuse the rest of the world :-)</p>
<p>how about KIRF?</p>
<blockquote>And for bonus points, name some other desserts that start with &#8220;K.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Kugel.</p>
<p>A Kouign &#8216;fucking&#8217; aman, it&#8217;s French (from Brittany), it&#8217;s delicious and my Grandma use to make me some.</p>
<p>Arrête, j&#8217;ai faim  !</p>
<p><em>One in the chamber, 32 in the KLP</em></p>
<p>&#8220;K&#8221; would be a great opportunity to lend a more international flavor to Android&#8230; Künefe anyone?</p>
<p>Eclair already did that.</p>
<p>If the OS version codenamed Tiramisu isn&#8217;t the best OS of all time, I will be very upset.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s easy: Kake, Kookies, Kobbler, etc.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what Google is doing with their OS and their own line of Nexus phones. When Google can not efficiently or speedily update their own OS on their own line of Nexus phones before the OEM&#8217;s, there is a major problem. It is now March and we still have no idea what went wrong with the ICS update for the Nexus S and 4G as Google has been completely silent on the matter for the last three months. Three months without a word from Google does not instill any kind of confidence in their competence of supporting their own OS on just their own line of Nexus phones, let alone every other device with Android on it. Not to mention that this is a long time to strand your users on an OS (rooting and flashing a downgrade is not a viable fix as it voids manufacturers warranty) that is draining their phones battery in less than six hours. There is also a very large problem with Google&#8217;s customer service for Android and the Nexus line of phones. The Nexus is special in that if there is any kind of software problem the manufacturer (Samsung, HTC) and the carrier (Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Verizon) will refer you to Google to find any kind of help. They are not on the hook, as the Android OS is Google&#8217;s responsibility on the Nexus line. Problem being that Google does not have any kind of customer service for the Nexus and it&#8217;s OS other than a forum. This forum goes largely ignored with even the most basic of questions and problems. Imagine if Apple only supplied a forum (no 800 number, no e-mail address, no Genius bar) as customer service for the iPhone. People would flip out. How is it okay for Google to treat it&#8217;s users and customers in this manner?</p>
<p>Please take a look at Google&#8217;s forums here: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/label?lid=551c5c4cca..." target="_blank">http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/label?lid=551c5c4cca&#8230;</a><br />
Almost every question marked as answered is not actually answered. They are just some reply from another user saying they have the same problem. On the off chance you finally find a question that Google has responded to, it is just some low level employee stating they know it&#8217;s a problem (offering no solution) or asking for bug reports. In fact it has gotten so bad on these forums that it&#8217;s Nexus users have resorted to spamming Android&#8217;s Google+ page <a href="https://plus.google.com/104629412415657030658/posts" target="_blank">https://plus.google.com/104629412415657030658/posts</a> in the hopes that Google will finally say something, anything on the issue. There are a lot of ignored and angry Nexus users out there.</p>
<p>Frankly I am tired of beta testing Google&#8217;s android OS and am appalled by their lack of customer service for the number one mobile OS in the world and their Nexus line of phones. Really, all of you should be too.</p>
<p>Then don&#8217;t? Buy a different phone? And telling other people what they &#8220;should&#8221; do is asinine. I like my Desire HD better than I liked my iPhone 4, so, I guess I&#8217;ll keep &#8220;beta testing&#8221;.</p>
<p>The thing is, as a non Nexus user you aren&#8217;t so much of a &#8220;beta tester&#8221;. Some prefer faster updates and go on with Nexus while there are people who don&#8217;t mind waiting some extra months and jump directly into 4.0.3+, which ever version gets released, eventually.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those running 2.3.5 and most definitely hope that once ICS gets released for my device it has been tested properly beforehand.</p>
<p>Klondike Bar</p>
<p>Wow seriously were going to talk about key lime pie? ICS just came out in november let&#8217;s at least talk about jellybean first.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite sure discussion about ICS vs JB vs KLP was rather short if it had to be based on actual OS features.</p>
<p>Another half-baked OS from Google?</p>
<p>Seriously folks, I had a sot of Lime Pie made with Tequila in Tucson. It was awesome</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Kulfi. Could be the one where they push into developing markets and optimize for lower specs.<br />
Should say I&#8217;m Indian.</p>

<p>Whats wrong with Kake?</p>
<p>Cake*</p>
<p>This is kinda retarded and cool at the same time. Bleh.</p>
<p>it will be kleeja.</p>
<p>Thanks, I can&#8217;t imagine what I would have done without this information!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to Android Sticky Toffee Pudding :) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_toffee_pudding)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_toffee_pudding)</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand the point of this.  Why not spend a little more time on getting a version out to the masses before trying to come up with cute names for future releases that most people probably won&#8217;t even see.</p>
<p>huh? Im pretty sure their OS roadmap with features and codenames is mapped out for 4 yrs. Same as iOS and WP7 who also use codenames. I dont understand your point.</p>
<p>why did they start with C? what happened to A and B?</p>
<p>From Wiki&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>There were two more internal releases, called &#8220;Astro&#8221; and &#8220;Bender&#8221;. The code names are in alphabetical order, and were allegedly changed from robots to desserts to avoid trademark issues.</blockquote></p>
<p>Kit Kat!</p>
<p>How did a company that makes it&#8217;s money from advertising miss this marketing opportunity?</p>
<p>The chance to win a Transformer Nexus in every Kit Kat wrapper!</p>
<p>I would prefer the chance to win a Kit Kat in every Transformer Nexus box.</p>
<p>Of course if they gave away a big box of Kit Kats with every phone, sales would skyrocket.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gvwealth.com/pix/Pie%20Slices.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s how people will illustrate Android fragmentation. Oh so delicious fragmentation.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m a bit early but I would like to request &#8216;molten chocolate cake&#8217; when Google reaches version M.</p>
<p>My vote is kringla!. <img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4935374097_172c088671.jpg" /></p>
<p>aka pretzel in US</p>
<p>Not at all.  Aka cakey sugar cookie.</p>
<p>Kiwi _______? I think that&#8217;s more widespread than key lime pie</p>
<p>I had thought kugelhopf would have been awesome.  There&#8217;s a severe lack of culture in these dessert choices.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean isn&#8217;t even a dessert.</p>
<p>That does not look like Key Lime Pie &#8230; it looks like a cheesecake with lime on the side&#8230;</p>
<p>Krispey Kreme<br />
Lemon Pie<br />
Marzipan<br />
Nugat<br />
Otter Pop<br />
Popcorn<br />

<p>Damn Google just ruined my favorite dessert by associating it with Android.</p>
<p>Seriously, nobody thought &#8220;Kettle Corn&#8221; would be better than &#8220;Key Lime Pie&#8221;?<br />
I&#8217;d rather have sweet popped kernels than citrusy semi-sour cream.</p>
<p>Laddu for L <img src="http://img.21food.com/20110609/product/1306750728711.jpg" /></p>
<p>I like the sound of Key Lime Pie. Doesn&#8217;t roll off the tongue, but it&#8217;s really making me hungry!</p>
<p>After reading all the comments, I see more people are interested in desserts than the fact that Jelly Bean and KLP are coming down the pipe while the latest and greatest (Galaxy Nexus) struggles with ICS&#8230;</p>
<p>The Kindle Fire carries ICS like a CHAMP!  Sorry about your inferior device</p>
<p>But what about X? You can&#8217;t keep going forever!</p>
<p>Really? An article about this?</p>
<p>I heard the following name is going to be cocanut cream. Now go write another article!</p>
<p>They go in alphabetical order&#8230;</p>
<p>What a horrible name.. They should just call it Krispy kreme</p>
<p>And piss off Dunkin Donuts?</p>
<p>As a Swede I think it should be named Android <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kladdkaka" target="new">Kladdkaka</a>.</p>
<p>Also I think Honeycomb should have been named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halava" target="new">Halava</a>.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t like how all these blogs are saying the names like they are all official&#8230;<br />
google has NEVER announced anything. even ICS was wrong.<br />
everyone thought it was ice cream. i don&#8217;t like how everyone is writing articles like it&#8217;s official.<br />
this is just straight up stupid.<br />
and who said it was JELLY BEAN for sure?</p>
<p>Does it have be a dessert? In my country, we call this <em>Lechon</em></p>
<p><img src="http://noobfoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/pork-lechon.jpg" /></p>
<p>mud pie :D</p>
<p>How about Kinder Surprise Egg?</p>
<p>Awesome suggestion</p>
<p>Well if you weren&#8217;t going to use Key Lime Pie there is always Koeksister. Although thinking of Google execs trying to speak Afrikaans is too horrible to contemplate. Hollywood does a bad enough job of the SOuth african accent as it is.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koeksister" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koeksister</a></p>
<p>It would be great if it is &quot; KAAJA&quot;<br /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.vasireddyswagruhafoods.com/images/swagruha-trad/kaaja.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looks like a VAAJINA</p>
<p>Was expecting a Kiwi-something&#8230;</p>
<p>I read this post before breakfast.</p>
<p>Screw you commenters &#8211; especially the folks who put up the pictures.</p>
<p>DAMN!!!!!!  I had my money on <strong>KUGLE</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Kugel.jpg/220px-Kugel.jpg" /></p>
<p>I was really hoping for KUGLE.. why? Because it sounds like GOOGLE.</p>
<p>KUGLL GOOGLE KUGLL!!</p>
<p>If its not KUGLE then thats because Islam will be offended..</p>
<p>Kebap?</p>
<p>Android Ketamine would be nice.</p>
<p>Jell-o Shots would have been nice, too.</p>
<p>And people thought they were just kidding when they said they were going to &#8220;double down&#8221; on android.  Key lime pie, WINNING!</p>
<p>Kolache</p>
<p>just rolls off the tongue!</p>
<p><strong>rolls eyes</strong></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s good to know what dessert-themed name Google is cooking up for their next Android release, I must admit that I&#8217;ve long since given up on looking forward to the actual releases themselves. They hardly ever (officially) show up on existing devices and, even on new devices, they&#8217;re rarely present in an unadulterated form.</p>
<p>I suppose it&#8217;s hard to get excited about what new features might possibly be coming to the next rumored flagship device-of-the-moment at some undetermined point in the future.</p>
<p>Kirsch injected dark chocolate Kit-Kat bars served on a Key lime mousse with Karo pecan fondant on trop of a Krispy Kreme doughnut with Kiwi Kool-Aid sauce served with Keurig Kahlua coffee tasting biscotti.</p>
<p>&#8230;with a green ketchup stuffed cherry tomato on top for the enthusiast.</p>
<p>Id settle for ICS.</p>
<p>K=KiwiFRUIT pie<br />
L = Lamington<br />
M= Macaroon<br />
N=  New York Cheesecake<br />
O= Orange tarts<br />
P = Pavlova! (this one is non negotiable)!</p>
<p>When are Google going to realise that products like Android are for use worldwide consumption and to stop using Americanisms?</p>
<p>For example:<br />
Donut = Americanism for Doughnut<br />
Froyo = so American I want to vomit<br />
Ice Cream Sandwich = American only product. International equivalents = Choc Ice or Sliders<br />
Florida Keys wtf pie = wtf?</p>
<p>Then there is &#8220;Airplane mode&#8221; instead of &#8220;Aeroplane mode&#8221;, also overwhelmingly called &#8220;Flight mode&#8221; to sensibly avoid the issue before Americans started taking over mobile software.</p>
<p>Knickerbocker Glory is a superior K-dessert and something that stands out much better &#8211; it would also show Google&#8217;s commitment beyond myopically viewing America as the world,</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>And who cares what the next versions are called if you still can&#8217;t get Ice Cream Sandwich (or even Version 3.0) on any devices yet? As a user of Android for the past 4 months moving from that &#8216;other&#8217; smartphone, I&#8217;m moving back as soon as I can &#8211; Galaxy S II is essentially obsolete now as can&#8217;t get software upgrades from 2.3.5. And don&#8217;t give me CynagenMod, I have  a pc for tinkering on, my phone should. just. work.</p>
<p>Dang it, hungry now</p>
<p>I just want Ice Cream sandwich on my Xoom.  Who do I need to pay off?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a 3G model, Verizon.  If it&#8217;s a WiFi, um&#8230; nobody.</p>
<p>What about Kringle?  Google does seem to have an affinity for pastry.</p>
<p>That picture looks delicious!<br />
Now I want pie.</p>
<p>I still think Jello Shot would have been the best name.</p>
<p><img src="http://s2.hubimg.com/u/890025_f520.jpg" /></p>
<p>I love how they have to make me hungry with their phones.. Keep it simple like Apple for once! And the rumor has it that Siri competitor will be on Jelly bean by the way. <a href="http://detectapple.com/google-developing-google-assistant-siri-competitor/" target="_blank">http://detectapple.com/google-developing-google-assistant-siri-competitor/</a></p>
<p>It should be kolache. Delicious Czech pastry. Popular in Central Texas and pretty much anywhere Czech immigrants settle.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s cool but, hope manufacturers can get it on more phones.</p>
<p><strong>Buy a Nexus and sell your current phone!</strong> That&#8217;s what I did and I am loving it! It&#8217;s no wonder Apple&#8217;s trying to ban it; it&#8217;s a million times better than what they offer &#8212; <strong>and they know it!</strong> Jelly Bean really is amazing!</p>
<p>I would if the next Nexus phone wasn&#8217;t a few months away.</p>
<p>the cycle can be repeated in a few months! besides, once you have the Nexus you know you&#8217;ll be one of the first to get KLP*</p>
<p>*is Key Lime Pie the official codename for the next version yet?</p>
<p>More or less. Chris Ziegler is referencing the same source that told him Jelly Bean was 4.1: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/4/2844126/android-key-lime-pie" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/4/2844126/android-key-lime-pie</a></p>
<blockquote>I would if the next Nexus phone wasn’t a few months away.</blockquote>
<p>I would take the train, but this station has too many boarding times&#8230;</p>
<p>I wanted to take a Nexus bus, but <em>too many arrived.</em></p>
<p>Yeah cause it super smart to to buy an almost two year old phone. I&#8217;m sure most verge readers don&#8217;t want the latest and greatest devices. But hey, you sounded clever&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>I would if the next Nexus phone wasn’t a few months away.</blockquote>
<p>Huh? Source please?</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus has been out since I/O 2011 so she is  probably correct in assuming that there working on a replacement. Personally im ready to jump ship from iOS to android but im waiting for the Nexus refresh with a higher resolution screen and a better camera so I wont be losing the two favorite features of my iPhone. Oh and I dont have a source either just my brain and some common sense related to phone release cycles&#8230;</p>
<p>Problem is both the Verizon &amp; Sprint Galaxy Nexus are not very good phones. A lot of people have to use Verizon just to have any coverage. So at least for Americans I bet 20-30% of users really have no good choice at all just because they can&#8217;t switch carriers.</p>
<blockquote>Problem is both the Verizon &amp; Sprint Galaxy Nexus are not very good phones.</blockquote>
<p>What makes you say that?</p>
<p>Very poor battery life, call quality issues, slower updates, signal quality issues, etc.  The Verizon model specifically is pretty much a total lemon compared to the GSM model unfortunately.</p>
<p>VZW GNex is the best phone I&#8217;ve ever used.  Your experience is not the majority.</p>
<p>I can count on 4 hours of screen-on time  (which means I&#8217;m pretty much not working very hard).</p>
<p>I think some people will have call quality issues for mostly geographical reasons.  No carrier has perfect towers everywhere.    I personally haven&#8217;t experienced any problems in 7 months with my Vz Galaxy Nexus, including at my parents house in the country.    My old Droid (with the vaunted Moto radios)  was always a sketchy proposition out there, but again it was a combination of towers and radios and geography causing problems.</p>
<p>My experience doesn&#8217;t make my call quality perfect and yours doesn&#8217;t make it a lemon.</p>
<p>I easily get through a typical day (~16 hours) on a single charge with my VZW GNex, and that&#8217;s while being in poor service areas for most of it.</p>
<p>Same unless i am pounding on it every min.</p>
<p>i have the HSPA+ version of this phone, and if i use it, it dies extremely quickly. I can barley get 10 hours out of it with my usage, which i don&#8217;t think is that heavy.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t understand how LTE aides this. I got a massive extended battery for it, which i keep in my backpack.</p>
<p>they are great phones. I own a VZW GNex. Its amazing.</p>
<p>Try using one.  Not perfect but quite good.</p>
<p>I just bought a nexus after dropping my thunderbolt last week and I got to say this is the best android phone I have owned. Once I installed a custom kernel I get 16.5 hrs of battery life with the 2100mah battery. Call quality and 4g is excellent on my device</p>
<p>Except for screen, camera, and build quality but a little make up conceals everything.</p>
<p>Does Apple know it because there sales are higher and higher every quarter? Or because the have richest selection of content for mobile devices? Android is great but its far from a million times better&#8230; And jelly bean will be amazing for the 3% of phones that get it and I would say Ice Cream Sandwich is amazing but I doubt it will ever break more than 50% of the user base.</p>
<p>Anyone else thinks Chrome is nowhere near as buttery as the stock browser? Makes me a little sad. I think it was smoother in beta.</p>
<p>it definitely wasn&#8217;t smoother in beta, BUT you do make a good point.. it could incubate some more before becoming stock.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s important about Chrome is that it joins the stable of Google apps that can be updated via the play store rather than only with an OS update. Imagine if Google Chrome, or Firefox, or what have you, on your PC could only update when a new version of Windows was released. It&#8217;s far better this way</p>
<p>To be fair, mobile OS&#8217;s are updated a lot more then Windows.</p>
<p>Not most Android phones.</p>
<p>Actually, that would mean that the first Android phone would have not been updated yet.</p>
<p>Yes they are. There are plenty of minor updates.</p>
<p>I guess you&#8217;ve never heard of Patch Tuesday&#8230;</p>
<p>This is wrong. The default browse in jellybean is using chrome but it is NOT an app. I don&#8217;t have chrome installed on my galaxy nexus via play store. I&#8217;m still able to download it and run it as a separate app..</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Never mind. I thought they replaced the google chrome browser in jellybean as stock. But when i updated my galaxy nexus to jellybean the  browser didn&#8217;t change. So i assumed they just changed the layout to look like the ICS browser but it turns out it&#8217;s still the same browser. Only the nexus 7 got the browser replaced with chrome.</p>
<p>I was wondering what the hell was going on.. Just read the changelog and understood.</p>
<p>Chrome is default for Nexus 7, but not for Jelly Bean (AOSP).</p>
<p>Does Nexus 7 has the Browser app though? Because if it doesn&#8217;t, the user will not be able to download it from the Play Store and hence will have to use Chrome.</p>
<p>See username&#8230; lol</p>
<p>The stock Android browser could be updated as frequently too. Consider how other &#8220;ROM&#8221; apps like Maps, Gmail, or even the Play Store have been updated. Essentially, if they place a particular application on the Play Store with the same signature as the original application, it can be updated. The only reason I can think of that might prevent it from being updated, would be if there is some library that must also be updated.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t update it frequently because the browser powers webView. They don&#8217;t want developers to have to continuely test their apps when ever browser updates. They&#8217;d rather to have them only have to do it with every Android update.</p>
<p>Correct.  I&#8217;m not suggesting that Google should change their release strategy, I&#8217;m only pointing out that just because it shipped in the ROM doesn&#8217;t mean that is why it isn&#8217;t being updated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible that webView isn&#8217;t upgradable through the Play Store.  If it isn&#8217;t packaged as an APK, then you wouldn&#8217;t be able to simply update.  If they leverage native libraries, then perhaps only a system update will work.</p>
<p>However, even on the Nexus 7 webView is independent of Chrome.  In someways it is like how Safari is released on the iPhone.  The webView API allows a developer to embed HTML resources or download websites online, but Chrome functions independently, as Safari functions independently from the webkit APIs built into iOS.</p>
<p>Does chrome have that &#8220;save page&#8221; feature from the stock browser yet? That&#8217;s the only thing it&#8217;s missing.</p>
<p>And a reader like feature that safari has would be awesome. That&#8217;s the one feature miss when using chrome.</p>
<p>Install an app like Pocket. Then you can just share pages from Chrome to Pocket and it&#8217;s saved for you to read later.</p>
<p>Reader in Safari is very handy for when you want to read it now (without jumping back and forth between apps), without all the extra crap on the page. A small, but important difference.</p>
<p>Like Sunny said, the Pocket app is one option. Because Chrome and many other apps have the Share&#8230; menu option, you just need an app like Pocket to add its entry there to save, email, print, send to Dropbox, or whatever else you want to do with the content.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the link: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&hl=en" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&amp;hl=en</a></p>
<p>You can still download the stock browser. Chrome will improve and improve. Google just chose to draw a line in the sand. Chrome is never done.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to download it, it&#8217;s already on the stock JB ROM. I&#8217;m just bitching because after reading this changelog I have tried it out again and, compared to Chrome, it felt really smooth again. I hope the Chrome team declared war on lag too.</p>
<p>Oh, not sure if it&#8217;s really already in the JB ROM, I could also accedentally have restored it from my TB backup.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit smoother for me.</p>
<p>yup</p>
<p>Stock browser is definitely way smoother. Saddens me, because I really want to use Chrome, but the difference in performance is just too much.</p>
<p>Self-frag!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running ICS on my Nexus One, so (with my phone occasionally deciding that enough is enough and just stopping for a few minutes), that distinction is really obvious :)</p>
<p>Personally, I actually <em>prefer</em> the stock browser on here. Slightly quicker for the simple kind of browsing I do on my phone, it still sees Chrome&#8217;s bookmarks (yay!), and the toolbar disappears when you scroll down instead of being permanently fixed to the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Never liked Chrome on Android. Scrolling isn&#8217;t smooth, fonts look weird and pages keep refreshing when you have more than a couple of tabs and you switch between them. Stock ICS browser is the best I&#8217;ve used on Android so far.</p>
<p>Chrome is borderline awful. The stock browser on ICS is the best i&#8217;ve used ever from any mobile platform. Can&#8217;t wait for Jelly bean on my GNex to see what it&#8217;s like then.</p>
<p>Not bad for a point release.</p>
<p>Android development is now accelerating, and is laser focused on user experience, due to all the hard tasks already been solved (the fragment api, supporting different screen densities, supporting external keyboard, external mouse, etc).</p>
<p>iOS is approaching the problem backward. They have focused on the user first, but now its difficult to support difference screen sizes and densities (retina was a necessity to avoid having to solve the general problem).  As such, iOS development seems to be slowing down in each release. Hardcoded Facebook + Twitter support. Thats not an OS feature, that&#8217;s two hardcoded implementations of a private sharing API.</p>
<p>I look forward to Android 5.0 as it will likely include a context-sensitive desktop mode and supporting Atrix like functionality on a platform wide basis.</p>
<p>iOS took the right approach at the start. And they will solve the rest of the issues slowly. They won&#8217;t do widgets ever. Otherwise everything else can be improved upon. And will be rather.</p>
<blockquote>They won’t do widgets ever.</blockquote>
<p>And you know this how?</p>
<p>Look at how apple has approached iOS all these years.. Apple is all about apps. They don&#8217;t want you spending time in the home screen. They want u to unlock and the go directly into an app. Come out and go into another or lock the phone again and back it goes in your pocket.  It&#8217;s just an observation of how they&#8217;ve approached iOS so far.</p>
<p>Heads five times in a row does not guarantee a head on the next toss.</p>
<p>Neglecting the home screen might mean that Apple is perfectly happy with it or it might mean they are taking their time and will make a considered change. Apple arguing that widgets are not important might mean they believe it or it may mean they have to say that because they haven&#8217;t prioritized them yet.</p>
<p>Unless you are best friends with Tim Cook and will be best friends with all future CEOs of Apple going forwards, absolutist statements  (such as &#8220;The won&#8217;t do widgets ever&#8221;) based on speculative interpretation stinks of hubris.</p>
<p>Give it a rest and calm down. I clearly said I am speculating in the next post based on 5 years observing iOS. Apple isn&#8217;t arguing anything, i&#8217;m just making a good guess on how the OS has evolved. They could&#8217;ve implemented Widgets sometime back. But maybe they dont. Or like thattechkid says below, it could go into Notification center</p>
<p>Hopefully homescreens as we know it will eventually go away&#8230; both Android and Metro seem to be evolving away from the desktop/app drawer concept and more towards providing the information that you seek in an intuitive way that elegantly uses screen real estate. Static icons are next to useless. They don&#8217;t display any information and their only purpose is an intermediary one&#8230;to get you into the app that finally provides what you wanted. I say good riddance. Notification centers and live tiles and Google Now type stuff will be the new model.</p>
<p>Agree that icon grids are next to useless.</p>
<p>They are useful up to about (subjectively) about 10 items on the screen. After that, the scanning cost of looking for what you want negates the simplicity. I usually swipe straight to spotlight search (on my 3GS) because it does not require scanning. My 3GS has about 8 homescreens of folders, I can&#8217;t create subfolders, I can&#8217;t put an app in multiple folders, and I can only put a finite number of items in a folder meaning I need folders such as  &#8220;Donut Games 1&#8221;, &#8220;Donut Games 2&#8221;, which requires further scanning or photographic memory.</p>
<p>Google Now type stuff might be part of the answer. Static icon grid is on the way out, no doubt.</p>
<p>I feel that they could of it goes in NC. I agree with you on their approach to iOS though. The Spring Board is for quickly launching apps. NC, on the other hand, is about informing you of what is going on on your device. I would welcome widgets in the NC (I already have SBSetting there, and it works great).</p>
<p>Yeah. Maybe something in NC. Apple can easily exploit more scrolling inputs in NC. Sideways scrolling for toggles and more widgets etc. Lets see.</p>
<p>If they had a seperate pages for widgets for notifications, and maybe they could call it Mission control and have running apps there too. I don&#8217;t like the current switcher&#8217;s ui. If they did different gestures for opening to a different page (like a double click would go to multitasking, slide down for notifications, and maybe a triple click for widgets?). Also, since this has turned into a wishlist for NC, how about changing the transition, it fits nothing with the rest of the transitons (sliding on top of the screen instead of the screen pulling down revealing the NC behind it).</p>
<p>How can u change the transition like that? If I am right, u mean the home screen fading in the background right? But that would mean some sort of action using the home button. NC to me seems perfect being slide down. It covers the whole screen so u cant even see the homescreen behind. But I agree, lots of improvements can be done in NC. I mainly want quick toggles for 3G/Wifi/BT/GPS. That could be easily accomodated in NC without consuming much space either.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that the current screen should slide down with NC behind it.   The current screen would slide down off the screen, instead of the current transition, which slides NC on top of the current screen. It would fit in with the rest of the transitions. For example, folders split, revealing the apps behind it. The switcher slides up, with current apps behind it. NC even uses the same Denim background as the others.</p>
<p>Maybe, they could make the transition like Mission Control on the Mac. Of course, the whole slide down thing wouldn&#8217;t work. I don&#8217;t know, but the Singapore (I think it was there, not sure) concept video where apps are arranged in a 3 &#215; 3 grid of thumbnails of the app.</p>
<p>.. is what I was thinking of. I don&#8217;t know why it posted that. I thought it posted the rest. Strange&#8230;</p>
<p>Spot on observation about the notification centre animation. Do you use the jailbreak tweak &#8220;Zephyr&#8221;? Because it has an option for exactly that. Looks great.</p>
<p> I also like to replace the background image of NC, folders and the switcher to a darker texture, as I can&#8217;t stand the default light grey linen Apple loves using.</p>
<p>I am only 14 and I have tried multiple times to convince my parents to let me set up a pay pal account so I can, but they don&#8217;t want me wasting money (yet for some reason, they let me have an iTunes account as long as I always have gift cards and never charge the credit card). I have heard of Zephyr, though.</p>
<p>I used to use a tweak that squished the current screen down, making it appear to be a 3D cube affect until I found BlurriedNC (not the exact name). It blurs the NC so you can partially see the screen behind it. You can adjust the blur level, even to the point where there is no blur and you can see the current screen behind it.</p>
<p>DesignIng UIs like that doesn&#8217;t make sense. You are saying we should design iOS animations based on the two existing ones of folders and multitasking. Folders opens like that because the apps are &#8220;inside&#8221; the folders. You wouldn&#8217;t use any animation for that. The multitask bar slides the screen up because it&#8217;s supposed to be in the background and not a physical tray. It would also look better IMO than if the multitask UI was an actual tray that slid on top of the current app anyway. Sometimes things are designed just because it looks better &#8212; there&#8217;s no exact science. As for the NC, if it pulled down the whole screen it would mean they would have to take a screen capture of the entire screen at high res at any given moment and translate it down. This is more expensive than pulling down a set linen pattern. Also having the whole interface pulling down especially on the iPad would be disorienting and less obvious what happened that having an overlay like how NC is now.</p>
<p>No one wants to go in and out of apps all day. People want information as quick as possible on a beautiful UI/UX. Android does this great with widgets and WP7 also does this with the live titles. iOS is dated. &#8211; But I have a feeling they will get it together.</p>
<p>Auto layout in iOS6 makes it pretty easy to support different screen sizes. Apple just didn&#8217;t bother adding the feature until they needed it. If they had added it earlier it&#8217;s not clear many developers would have used it since the existing hardware did not require it. There are perks of using auto-layout for internationalization even if screen sizes/resolutions stay the same. It allows different languages to flow more naturally in the UI. Apps that cannot easily adopt auto layout will probably just utilize black borders as needed. Not a fantastic solution but users can live with that for a few months if they really have to. Going back to Android there was certainly (and still is) on-going issues with flexible layouts. It&#8217;s never going to be as easy as static layouts.</p>
<p>As for the FaceBook/Twitter stuff it&#8217;s all implemented in the new Social Framework which is not private &#8212; it&#8217;s part of the public iOS SDK. Apps are not at all hard-coded directly into those services. The Social Framework exists to abstract all that. At this time iOS only offers Twitter &amp; FaceBook services but if they were to add something else developers will get it for &#8216;free&#8217; with the Social Framework.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t disagree with your core point that in some cases Google make more forward thinking design choices but I believe there are a number of iOS features that are similarly forward thinking compared to Android. iCloud for example is far more ambitious than G-Drive for example. They&#8217;ve had the Game Center APIs available for a while now. Integrating  third party apps directly into Mapping via transit/routing apps is also interesting. iOS has things like GPU computing with the Accelerate API and OpenCL (which IIRc is not available to developers yet)</p>
<p>Google Drive is just a new name. Google kept everything (photos, contacts, and all kind of files if you want) on the cloud all along.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen auto layout but the problem is current iOS apps will not be able to look good on a 4 inch iPhone. They are too late.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll look exactly the same &#8212; some apps just won&#8217;t utilize the full display until the developer has tested and flagged compatibility (either via auto-layout or the existing strut/spring system) Otherwise they will have ~170 pixels worth of blank space at the top and bottom of the display.  A lot of games will end up doing this in the short term. Longer term they will move things like HUD elements to the extra space since that&#8217;s a quick and easy way to utilize the entire display.</p>
<p>Most of it I agree with, except the last part. I doubt many of the games out now will be adapted. Maybe the more profitable ones will see a reason to release a new &#8220;HD&#8221; version, but I doubt many of them will do it for as you say. Just look at the Android equivalents if you don&#8217;t believe me. :)</p>
<p>+will do it for <i>free</i> as you say</p>
<p>When retina iPhone and iPad came out, it didnt take much time. Nowadays developers are well prepared in advance. Look what happen when retina ipad came out, most apps were submitted with retina assets. All of the good apps on iPad are already retina. Transition wont be long</p>
<p>Retine iPhone and iPad did not change the screen size. They doubled the resolution and told apps to upscale 2&#215;. The only thing developers had to do was to update the assets. iPhone 5 will be an entirely different story. A different screen size and a different resolution. All apps will brake overnight. They will literally have to be redesigned from scratch. This is why Apple has been avoiding releasing a larger iPhone all this time.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t have to be redesigned from scratch, they will need a few, relatively minor, layout adjustments. It won&#8217;t be that much of a departure.</p>
<p>Depends on whether they&#8217;ll change the resolution. If it&#8217;s the same res, but bigger, nothing will need to be changed. If the resolution changes it will be a mess.</p>
<p>If the rumors are true, then they&#8217;ll be changing the long edge, and maintaining the short edge resolutions. If that&#8217;s the case, the resolution adjustments will be extremely easy to fix for 99% of all apps, and will, most likely, not be terribly different than the current process apps utilize for the double size status bar, so they should still be able to handle all devices with the same amount of layouts and assets as now.</p>
<p>If that is the case, iPhone will still have small screen and low resolution.</p>
<p>Some of us actually want a phone and not a tablet to carry around everywhere as a phone. The iPhone being portable is a benefit, not a flaw.</p>
<p>So you won&#8217;t buy the new iPhone if they increase the screen size? Because then you will have agreed that the current iPhone screen is smaller than you would like.</p>
<p>If its 4&quot; than it will be fine. I&#8217;d prefer it stay the size it is, but if the new one is bigger, I&#8217;m not exactly going to have much choice. It&#8217;s not like there is a good, small, high end alternative made by anyone else. 4&quot; would still be better than any of the idiotically giant high end Android phones.</p>
<p>If anything, it won&#8217;t be black, more likely the denim (ugh) that is used everywhere else. I am surprised they haven&#8217;t included a denim wallpaper by know since they like it so much. I assume their will be a JB tweak that allows you to change it to your home screen background. One can hope&#8230;</p>
<p>No, in this case, I do think they&#8217;d opt for the blacking out the empty areas (like for videos), not putting in a background texture.</p>
<p>So every game will have to be designed two times. Both for iPhone 4 and iPhone 5. Sounds a lot like, umm, fragmentation!</p>
<p>It will be on a lot less of a scale then 400+ devices some Android app developers do. Besides, I think Apple will release an API so that new apps won&#8217;t have to do much work. I am not very good with app development so, this isn&#8217;t my area of expertise.</p>
<p>People develop software for operating systems, not devices. The fact that there are 400+ Android devices does not mean they have to be tested on all of them. So fragmentation is actually a normal thing. I was making fun of people who kept calling Android fragmented.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure if that&#8217;s what you meant. Some apps could work on plenty of devices by making it strictly for the OS. Though, because Android has diverse hardware made by multiple OEM&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Fragmentation is an issue, though it isn&#8217;t nearly as big as some like to make it. The reason that on mobile devices, they try to optimize with limited hardware. For games, they want to squeeze as much performance out of a chip.</p>
<p>There really is no way to avoid fragmentation with the open model Android has. I feel that the pros of Android&#8217;s model outweighs its cons.</p>
<blockquote>Android has diverse hardware made by multiple OEM’s.</blockquote>
<p>Yes but this is what an operating system is. This is true for all operating systems. This the norm. Windows, Ubuntu, Debian, FreeBSD, Haiku. They all run on diverse hardware made by multiple OEM’s. So actually iOS and BlackberryOS are the weird ones, Android is a perfectly normal OS.</p>
<p>I agree to a point. The reason fragmentation is there on Android and not on other open source models is because of the amount of power. Desktop computers have a lot more power under the hood, making the need for optimization a lot less then on a mobile device</p>
<p>Mobile devices have less power, so to make them budget friendly and have better performance, apps are optimized for chips.</p>
<p>It is the same for console vs pc gaming. PC&#8217;s can be easily upgraded with new chips. To avoid people from getting mad about yearly releases, they only release consoles near 10 years (that is the plan, anyways). Do to old hardware, they optimize like crazy. So mobile phones are like consoles, underpowered (not exactly the same, one is due to age and the other is due to space and/or economics), while PC gaming rigs are like general purpose PC&#8217;s (for this analogy, anyways).</p>
<p>That is also why I think that the GNexus is faster then other phones with similar hardware: it is optimized by being built alongside the next Android release.</p>
<p>Yeah, no</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t need to be designed twice for a minor variation in a single edge resolution.</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re just guessing though. You don&#8217;t know what Apple is going to do with the new iPhone.</p>
<p>I know that no matter what they&#8217;ll do, apps won&#8217;t have to be completely redesigned.<br />
If you&#8217;re gonna be a troll, at least try not to be an idiotic one.</p>
<p>Of course. iPhone apps were never redesigned for the iPad. They all just worked perfectly. Apple can give the new iPhone any screen size and resolution they want. Apps won&#8217;t be redesigned. Feel free to believe it if that sounds more comforting to you.</p>
<p>Designing for a slightly different resolution requires a few layout tweaks. Designing for a wholly different type of device is a completely different situation. The reasons tablets have different UI designs isnt because of the resolution, it&#8217;s for the completely different use case of such a device.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;re saying just makes you look ignorant, and shows you completely lack of understanding of UI design and are just being a trolling fanboy.</p>
<p>Good points.</p>
<p>The Social Framework API is not really open, and sometimes sharing is not somthing that you might want to do with a social network, but possibly something like evernote, or Google Drive, etc. The API just isn&#8217;t as fully featured as intents on Android, but it doesn&#8217;t even need to be, it just needs to be open for application authors to add new targets (which it is not).</p>
<p>Yes, Apple tends to implement as they require the implementation. In many ways this gives them time to think things through (such as the multitasking implementation in iOS 4 which I think was a decent trade-off). In other ways, it is a weakness as its difficult to change a foundation after a city has been build upon it.</p>
<p>Auto layout might be great in iOS 6, but layout and non-integer dpi scaling are two separate things. Android will scale to any DPI, until now, there has been just two settings on phones and two settings on tablets. As such, its going to be tough to migrate applications that have built their UIs around these assumptions. I suspect just a fifth set of hard coded layouts will be added if a larger iPhone screen is introduced this year. Contrast that to Android where all screen sizes have to be considered from the start (even if many app authors fail to support all sizes).</p>
<p>iOS is making tiny incremental changes in UI to deal with things like layout when Android is done with all the nuts and bolts and has moved on to rapid development of user experience enhancements.</p>
<p>Right now, Android wins in terms of features, but iOS beats Android in a tailor made application UIs and smooth UI experience. With the introduction of ICS and now JB, the monopoly on smooth UI is over, and Android feels fresh and vibrant. Its for Apple&#8217;s engineers to now prove that they can keep iOS fresh at the same time as firefighting infrastructure requirements that have already been solved on Android.</p>
<p>Not sure I&#8217;d agree with Android winning on features. Some yes, but some no. For example I was flashing this 4.1.1 ROM the other day and had to do a clean wipe and I was seriously annoyed I couldn&#8217;t do a full device restore from the cloud. It restored a few things like my wifi password, contacts, calendars, etc but I lost everything else. I had forgot Android couldn&#8217;t do this without third party apps. It also did not restore my applications so I had to go through the list one-by-one and reinstall them. These are problems that were fixed in iOS5.</p>
<p>I think they just have different priorities so it&#8217;s hard to compare. Google doesn&#8217;t have OSX as their &#8216;real&#8217; operating system so maybe they are more interested in pushing Android into that direction while Apple does have OSX so they are really focused on keeping iOS simple and focused on a few specific devices. I don&#8217;t think either approach is wrong. It&#8217;s just up to the consumer to decide which one fits better for them. I like both.</p>
<p>Well said.</p>
<p>Maybe because of your ROM yours didn&#8217;t reinstall your stuff. I have EVERYTHING resinstalled when I get a new phone. The apps auto install when the phone signs into your Google account, you get your contacts, mail, calendars, photos, videos, music, and WiFi passwords, and browser bookmarks. OH and I never had to plug in, which I haven&#8217;t ever had to do with Android. The only difference is it doesn&#8217;t sync app data unless the data is stored on Google Servers (which some apps are developers can put that in their apps). So maybe wait until an official 4.1.1 is out and if your data is all on Google&#8217;s cloud storage, it will ALL sync back.</p>
<p>As SOFrOsTY pointed out, many applications will restore this for you and Android restores all of your applications you&#8217;ve installed from the Play Store sans data. If you have ICS or above, there is also an ADB command that can backup everything, including user data. You do have to be connected by USB to make that work, but it is a really nice feature.</p>
<p>Did a factory reset and everything came back. Took a while to reinstall all apps, but it works fine.</p>
<p>Oh, so you&#8217;re saying iOS has perfected restoring your settings <strong>when you flash a new iOS ROM?</strong></p>
<p>Please post a wiki. We&#8217;d all like to know how you accomplished that feat.</p>
<p>Chrome (the browser) is Google&#8217;s OS. I don&#8217;t know if you noticed the Chrome Web Store and the apps&#8217; prominent placement on the start page/speed dial, but it really appears Google intends to layer most of what you think of an OS onto every other OS, including Windows and Chrome OS. They want it to be universal. Just abstract out all the OS-specific APIs and make shit just work everywhere. All while storing your personal data on their servers where they can make sense of it and use it to personalize the experience, both for marketing and for user features.</p>
<p>Android is just another base level OS upon which to layer Chrome. Chrome OS is more like a technical preview than anything. Chrome on more mature OSes is much more functional at this point.</p>
<blockquote>it just needs to be open for application authors to add new targets (which it is not).</blockquote>
<p>There seems to be some misunderstanding on this point. Apple, effectively, just does this the opposite way of Android (at least for everything but sharing on social networks). The &#8220;Open In&#8230;&#8221; menu is populated with choices of any apps that register their file type capabilities with the OS, so if Evernote wants to be able to open text files, they just have to register that file compatibility with the system, and the other app just has to implement the &#8220;open in&#8221; menu API. It&#8217;s a result of Apple&#8217;s file system sandboxing, and the steps are just different than on Android, only better or worse depending on your workflow.</p>
<p>As for sharing (social networks) that&#8217;s not part of the same API, and could be handled through the iOS app url schemes, but it is not as simple to implement as intents, but I personally think that the separation of the two tasks is actually better on iOS. I don&#8217;t have much interest in sharing a lot of things on social networks, but I do see a lot of value in improving inter-app communication on iOS, and I think the two actions are different enough that, from a UX perspective, they shouldn&#8217;t be lumped in the same &#8220;Share&#8221; menu.</p>
<p>Uh no, jelly bean still isn&#8217;t as smooth as iOS (or WP7). It also maintains the massive amount of response lag endemic to Android, a problem that will never really go away.  And your whole &#8220;city foundation&#8221; comment is silly.  Apple&#8217;s limited number of tightly controlled hardware targets gives them far more flexibility to do whatever they want in software, especially since every device is updated the day a new version of iOS is released.</p>
<p>I love JellyBean&#8230;</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p>Is there a hope that one day, they will add a Select All to the regular email client? Or at least an &#8216;empty trash&#8217; option? People have been asking for that for like years and it&#8217;s still not in there.</p>
<p>Annoying when stock apps don&#8217;t make the progress you&#8217;d wish them to. At least with Android, you can use other email applications.</p>
<p>How about mail threading? Didn&#8217;t iOS get that about 3 years ago?  This is the thing that kind of annoys me about this topic. People always gloss over a lot of the problems in Android because you can install some custom ROM or whatever to fix it. I use both platforms everyday and I notice a lot of these differences. For example out of the box on most Android phones you can&#8217;t show your battery percentage &#8212; only a meter. Again this is something iOS has included for a while. Back to e-mail the stock POP/IMAP client on Android is terrible. While it does have multi-touch zoom, unlike the GMail app, it&#8217;s horrible laggy and slow. It looks like it is resizing the fonts instead of just zooming. This is something that was silky smooth on the original iPhone in 2007. No excuse for that.</p>
<p>Sounds like they are neglecting vanilla mail and devoting all attention to GMail. I haven&#8217;t noticed because I use GMail.</p>
<p>Surely a 3rd party mail app must have already solved the aforementioned issues?</p>
<p>The only good alternative I know of is K9 which has its own set of issues. Mostly UI related. It&#8217;s just a very awkward application to navigate. It relies heavily on nested menus. If anyone knows of a better option I&#8217;d love to hear some suggestions. The problem with focusing on GMail is tons of people are using POP/IMAP/Exchange for work e-mail. I would get fired if I even thought about forwarding my work e-mail to GMail. Just not an option.</p>
<p>How does one replace the existing battery icon with one which displays percentage? Does it involve rooting/flashing? Using a theme?</p>
<p>Unfortunately it involves rooting and flashing a ROM that supports that feature.</p>
<p>There are flashable zips that work with stock ROM&#8217;s, I think. All you&#8217;d need to do is root.</p>
<p>Correct, forgot about that. But all in all that&#8217;s not really less effort than a complete ROM, when starting from stock.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting for a Gmail client that zooms out automatically when you open a HTML email so that I can scan the whole email and opt to zoom in for detail. IIRC, every mail client that I know of does this.</p>
<p>If we take Apple&#8217;s method of counting every change as a &#8216;new feature&#8217; then JellyBean introduces 141 &#8216;new features&#8217;, which aint bad!</p>
<p>Just curious, did you count all of them by hand on the list?</p>
<p>Yeah :(</p>
<p>You could have written a script that counts the bullets in front of the sentences. But as a Linux user, I may be excepting too much from people :)</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t google make the stock android browser, chrome?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure for most devices, Chrome will be the default and only browser.</p>
<p>I think they left it out of ASOP because that would essentially make Chrome open-source, and allow it&#8217;s design to be modified by OEM&#8217;s like Samsung and HTC.  Not to mention, there could be security problems if that was pure open-source when you think about stuff like how Chrome syncs passwords and stuff.</p>
<p>Perfect answer.</p>
<p>Chromium is open source and OEMs are welcome to do whatever they want with it.</p>
<p>Also, security through obscurity doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<blockquote>Not to mention, there could be security problems if that was pure open-source when you think about stuff like how Chrome syncs passwords and stuff.</blockquote>
<p>NO! This is a common and HUGE misconception about open source software.</p>
<p>Quite the contrary, open source software on all levels (including kernels such as Linux) are more secure than close source ones. Open source does not mean the user can modify the software while it is running. You cannot modify a login manager to accept any password for instance. Because it has already been compiled and it turned into a binary. It is no more modifiable than a closed source software now. The only advantage a closed source software can have over open source is that it can employ &#8220;security through obscurity&#8221; which is almost universally considered terrible practice.</p>
<p>Besides, stock Browser (which is open source) also does syncing with your Google password.</p>
<p>I take it you&#8217;ve never heard of Chromium&#8230;<br />
You know, the open source project which provides a browser almost identical to Chrome. Because, well, they are the same codebase.</p>

<p>As Chris Zielger has said, Chrome is a closed source implentation of the open source Chromium.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they want people to mess with Chrome&#8217;s design.  (And that&#8217;s a good thing IMO)</p>
<p>Yep&#8230; It&#8217;s like all over the project pages and official blogs and tech news and newspapers of record and such.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t just compile Chromium for Android. Chromium is for Windows/Mac/Linux only.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s weird. The link I posted called &#8220;Android Build Instructions&#8221; might change your mind.</p>
<p>Crystal clear:<br />
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/AndroidBuildInstructions" target="_blank">http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/AndroidBuildInstructions</a></p>
<p>Chrome is the default browser on the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean on the Galaxy Nexus still has the old &#8220;Browser&#8221; browser, because that&#8217;s what the phone shipped with and some people maybe like it so why take it away when you can have both.</p>
<p>Well, Facebook contacts sync originally shipped on some devices, but Google disabled that in a later OS release with the hope that some backlash might encourage Facebook to comply. I think if Google thought Chrome for the phone was better than the stock browser, it would be the default for AOSP builds and the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>afaik both facebook and twitter apps&#8217; syncing features bombed out when they couldn&#8217;t be bothered keeping up with the times.</p>
<blockquote>Well, Facebook contacts sync originally shipped on some devices, but Google disabled that in a later OS release with the hope that some backlash might encourage Facebook to comply.</blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;re wrong, they disabled Facebook sync on the Nexus S, which didn&#8217;t ship with the Facebook app (you had to download it). They didn&#8217;t disable it on the Nexus One, which did ship with the Facebook app, precisely for that reason.</p>
<p>So what they&#8217;re doing with Chrome now is consistent with that decision.</p>
<p>You may be right.  I had both devices, so which one wasn&#8217;t working is less clear in my mind.</p>
<p>That should really be an app anyway.</p>
<p>The Browser app is something special. It&#8217;s fast, has synced bookmarks, does full screen and now has extra-swishy quick controls.</p>
<p>Chrome wastes an inch with the notification bar and the address bar, plus you can&#8217;t have &#8216;quick controls&#8217; as well as &#8216;side swipe tab switching&#8217;.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re both different perspectives on browsing and both are welcome and i use both and i like both and i cannot permanently choose between both as both are great.</p>
<p>Oh shit what a shame I have two awesome browsers on my phone. (+Overskreen).</p>
<p>Which brings me to a bugbear of jellybean &#8211; i&#8217;d like to just choose the browser i open again instead of having to his &#8216;once only&#8217; everytime.</p>
<blockquote>Which brings me to a bugbear of jellybean – i’d like to just choose the browser i open again instead of having to his ‘once only’ everytime.</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m not a fan of the change they did to the app chooser in 4.1.</p>
<p>I also make good use of the &#8220;Inverted rendering&#8221; option that is only available on the stock browser for some reason.  Also, the white address bar in Chrome burnt into my SAMOLED display on my G-Nex.</p>
<p>I think they forgot to mention Magazines?</p>
<p>They did.</p>
<p>Magazines aren&#8217;t a 4.1 feature.  It is a new app available for all devices.</p>
<p>Good point, but then again, they do mention Play Movies &amp; TV Shows, Music, and Books.</p>
<p>I love my Nexus but I still do not have 4.1&#8230; How can Apple roll out updates to everyone (million of users) at once and Google can&#8217;t even roll out an update to all there Nexus phones at once&#8230; There isn&#8217;t even really that many of them out there&#8230; Sad.</p>
<p>judging by your name, I sense a very troll-ish post&#8230; If you have a Nexus you should know how to flash a ROM.</p>
<p>While I agree that Fragmentation is trolling just because you have a Nexus doesn&#8217;t automatically make you a geek that has time on their hands to flash a phone. Some users may have purchased it because it merely came from Google.</p>
<p>Well, I think I have read somewhere that some Nexus Phones&#8217; updates area aged by Samsung, not Google. The former would rather you just upgrade the phone while the latter prefers you to have the latest update, not caring about buying newer hardware sooner (I think they are called Yakju builds and some other weird name).</p>
<p>Not wishing to feed a troll, but others may find the answer useful. Android receives OTA updates as they are released by the phone carriers. In order to minimize network bandwidth, the carriers stagger the release over several days or sometimes perhaps longer. Installing a ROM upgrade from your computer does not affect the carrier&#8217;s bandwidth, so naturally you can download and install to the millions of devices you allude to. Now that iOS has an OTA update feature, the release will probably be staggered for iPhone users too, but I&#8217;m sure it can still be installed through iTMS as well.</p>
<blockquote>Android receives OTA updates as they are released by the phone carriers.</blockquote>
<p>In the case of the GSM Galaxy Nexus (and all phones sold unlocked in general), carriers have nothing to do with the OTA.</p>
<p>But it is still in the interest of Google in this case to roll the change out slowly at first to make sure there aren&#8217;t widespread problems.  Affect fewer customers if the release is bad instead of causing problems for everyone.  The OTA update still goes over the carrier&#8217;s network, so it is still in everyone&#8217;s interest to roll it out slowly as they do.</p>
<p>They rolled out Jelly Bean to the Galaxy Nexus OTA less than two weeks after announcing it.  iOS 6 was announced when?&#8230;.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;re never going to update Listen, I really wish they would just open source it. Please Google. Please.</p>
<p>Agreed.  Such a shame.  I&#8217;ve been very pleased with PocketCasts for the most part.  I do wish they would upgrade to holo guidelines and drop the iOS design.</p>
<p>I hope the distinction between Android features and &#8220;Google experience&#8221; features doesn&#8217;t mean I won&#8217;t get Google Now on my dear One S in a few months. If the JB update from HTC doesn&#8217;t include now I&#8217;ll have to deal with voiding my warranty to install a custom ROM.</p>
<p>The biggest issue with anything like that is HTC&#8217;s possible desire to customise things (like the multitasking).</p>
<p>Has anyone figured out how to &#8220;set a song as your ringtone from Play Music, and the new ringtone editor lets you crop that track to the exact section you&#8217;d like to use for the ringtone.&#8221; (taken from linked source) I have tried every option in Play Music both on my Nexus and on the website but can&#8217;t find it&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not there in the gapps release as of 7/14.  The version number needs to be higher than 4.3.605.392829 (which is what is in the most recent gapps flashes).  Perhaps Google is sitting on a Google Music update that they haven&#8217;t posted yet.</p>

<p>SUE EVERYBODY</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been able to tap on the picture taken to go to the gallery for ages. So swipe is spectacularly better than tap?</p>
<p>The Google Play Music widget now lets you thumbs up songs as <strong>their </strong>playing and features a new design for better readability<br />
They&#8217;re!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve held off from using Android as my primary mobile OS but it has made tremendous progress. With ICS, I saw a quantum leap. With Jellybean, we&#8217;re seeing the right amount of refinement. But I second those who hesitate in buying a Galaxy Nexus just because it has been upgraded to JB.</p>
<p>First off, the camera on the GN is still complete ass. I don&#8217;t care what anyone says. Second of all, those who think Chrome needs to get a lot better are right. I honestly prefer Chrome on iOS as a browsing experience. So that needs to improve. Third, there IS another Nexus device around the corner. But what carriers have done to gimp Nexus devices has made me extremely wary of buying anything but an unlocked Nexus device from the Google Play store. And yet, how can I guarantee that a future Nexus phone is going to work on my carrier&#8217;s LTE bands? In exchange for that functionality, the carrier will want to gimp something during the development phase &amp; Android users will have to suffer (until they root their phones).</p>
<p>I think the one thing Google has left to do is really showcase their muscle against the carriers. You shouldn&#8217;t have to root your phone to have a good experience and remove crapware. If you buy a phone for Google Wallet, you should expect it to be there. Yes, Apple compromised on tethering and they will have to compromise on cellular FaceTime but no one has to jailbreak an iPhone to get rid of crapware. There IS no crapware. I wish Google could prove to all of us that it knew how to play hardball with the carriers. The fact is, a Nexus experience is fantastic unless you&#8217;re getting it from Verizon or Sprint and that&#8217;s just unacceptable.</p>
<p>I loved reading the change log but I can&#8217;t think of what is left to add? Are there really any items left on the wishlist other than the usual &#8220;please make it faster, more efficient, longer lasting, etc.&#8221;?</p>
<p>One reason why I didnt get the GNex even though its probably the android phone to get. Terrible camera. Low light performance is utter rubbish. I cant believe Samsung put such a bad cam on that phone.</p>
<p>Yea, Google &amp; Samsung really messed up on the GN&#8217;s camera. And while I like the curved glass, I did not like the choice of materials for the body. I would have gladly added some weight to that phone for a magnesium or aluminum body. Since we already know what the next iPhone is going to look like, I can only hope that the next Nexus phone takes a huge leap over the GN.</p>
<p>Well, there is a rumor that 5 different OEM&#8217;s are partnered with Google to make 5 different Nexus phones. I bet one will have a durable build.</p>
<p>Imagine image sense on an HTC Nexus. Oh wait, you don&#8217;t have to. With the rumor that five Nexus devices are coming, one is bound to be made by HTC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to see what Nexus device Motorola can build, now that it is part of Google.</p>
<p>Yep, it is is a great time to be a tech enthusiast&#8230;</p>
<p>If it is a Nexus it would not have image sense. HTC wouldn&#8217;t be doing the software, Google would.</p>
<p>I forgot that ImageSense also had a software side too&#8230;</p>
<p>The only way it would happen is if they modified ImageSense so it only worked with the hardware. Then released the hardware with it. Other phone would have the software, but couldn&#8217;t use it in their phones.</p>
<p>Or, Google could break the promise of having a pure google experience and add it just HTC&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>No. Nexus devices run AOSP. Thats the whole point of them. But maybe HTC will commit their code to AOSP.</p>
<p>That is what I was saying with the hardware thing. If they make sure it is protected on the hardware side, they could put it in the software by making it incompatible for others.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s very fair to expect Google to have the same kind of clout with carriers as Apple does.</p>
<p>I agree. Though, it does seem that the carriers are finally listening to Samsung with Gakaxy S III, not being changed and all.</p>
<p>Except for Verizon. It&#8217;s always like that.</p>
<p> I changed my mind about Google Now. Its seems to be just Personalize Widgets that are Time and Location aware. There  are apps in Apple&#8217;s app store (and Apple&#8217;s own reminders app) that are also time and location enabled. And once Apple&#8217;s new maps service is ready, there will be a lot more in the app store. What I do like about Google Now is that these widgets are elegant uniform cards. Not like the ugly hodge podge  other widgets on Android.</p>
<p>So tempted to get a G-Nexus, gonna hold out until the rumored 5 phones are out! Good thing I have a Xoom to play with JB on :D</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been checking out the new features and cross referencing with the change log. Overall, this is a really nice update.</p>
<p>I am however very concerned that Google now/search will not recite the three laws of robotics. Sure, it points me to a Wikipedia page, but I get the feeling it&#8217;s brushing me off.  Ask who the CEO of Google, Microsoft or Apple is and it recites the information.</p>
<p>I think now is the time to straighten this out, before the technology gets any better.</p>
<p>Bug fix HAH</p>

<p>In other news: Google&#8217;s lawn seriously needs some resowing.</p>
<p>Asus is really building a great reputation. Solid hardware. Faster than the rest software updates. I trust them.</p>
<p>My returned TFP disagrees with you, but my Nexus 7 thinks you&#8217;re so right.</p>
<p>Why did you return it.? I was thinking I might return my due to the IO issues, but the latest OTA REALLY helped. (You  may have to do a coldboot<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ3Y1i5DXlI" target="new">[Video-Link] </a>after the update  to see benefits though.) Also, the keyboard dock works so good imo&#8230;does what it says on the tin!</p>
<p>ANR errors, yes, but also LCD mura, poor construction/design (that flimsy bit of metal above the charging point was just begging to break), etc etc. I liked it ok, but there were things that were chronically annoying to me, so when I saw Amazon was accepting returns on older TFPs I jumped on the chance. Couldn&#8217;t be happier with the N7 (form factor suits me better, too).</p>
<p>As well as providing a near vanilla Android experience. Count me in!</p>
<p><strong>near</strong> Vanilla. Wish they wouldn&#8217;t tweak the default button images. They&#8217;re the most visible part of the OS. Oh well. At least they haven&#8217;t slapped an entire skin on it.</p>
<p>Hopeful for Android Key Lime Pie then, with OEMs supposedly receiving a platform developers kit 3 months prior to its launch, Asus might be able launch it actually at launch, more platform holders need to come close to vanilla Android</p>
<p>But did you buy it.</p>
<p>Updating the TF101 would be an interesting to way to finish off it&#8217;s life cycle.</p>
<p>Think you maybe be dead in the water there&#8230;</p>
<p>Too early to tell I think. It obviously would be at the end of the update list.</p>
<p>Google Now is pretty useless on a WiFi tablet unfortunately &#8211; I barely use it on my Nexus 7 compared to my CM10 SII</p>
<p>True. Alot more usage with an ongoing connection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not <em>that</em> bad. I totally get what you&#8217;re saying, but it&#8217;s not nearly useless.<br />
For instance, sports alerts work great and I&#8217;d imagine that if it&#8217;s the day that you go to see a movie, it&#8217;ll show that data once you&#8217;ve been near one on the same day with your phone a few times. Though Maps obviously wouldn&#8217;t be able to provide turn-by-turn navigation(not with all the features, anyway, without a Wi-Fi hotspot), it would also work just fine with telling you how long you have before you need to leave for an appointment, too.</p>
<p>Using a tablet without some way of keeping a ongoing connection is pretty useless in itself to me. My cell lets me keep a hotspot at all times so Google Now on my tab is pretty nice. Much better than the S-Voice crud on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4g).</p>
<p>I was interested by the Transformer infinity, but the price really put me off. More than an iPad, and I might as well pick an iPad&#8230;</p>
<p>2 different experiences to be honest. All about the experience you want.</p>
<p>amazon shows it $100 cheaper than an ipad at comparable storage levels.</p>
<p>unless you&#8217;re comparing the new tablet to an old ipad, or including the price of the optional keyboard dock.</p>
<p>in any case, your price comparison is off-base.</p>
<p>Not in the UK at least:</p>
<p>iPad 32GB: £479, TF700 32GB: £500<br />
iPad 64GB: £559, TF700 64GB: £599</p>
<p>The 32Gb model of the TF700 isn&#8217;t officially available in the UK but otherwise your price for the 64Gb model includes the keyboard dock.</p>
<p>This has me excited for the Padfone event later this month.  Not completely sold on the idea that I have a use for a tablet, but if it launches with Jelly Bean it&#8217;s certainly a very attractive option.</p>
<p>Actually, even after updating my Prime to JB, many Google apps looks bad on 10&quot; tablet. For example, Google Now at first start not worked on landscape mode until I applied all agreements and examples, and reloading circle not centered in any mode on Google Now. App managment with running apps on Settings with slide-tabs looks weird on tablet. There are so many little inconsistencies and weird things, that looks good on the phone, bu bad on 10&quot; tablet.﻿</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in no way saying that that situation is okay and Google should have fixed it by now, but the second they release a 10&quot; tablet, things will be much better, I&#8217;d imagine.</p>
<p>Sure it will, always around the corner someday maybe.</p>
<p>Too bad the jellybean update was a hassle. Yet another screw up by Asus. I feel like the public still doesn&#8217;t know what a terrible product the Transformer Prime is; riddled with i/o issues, sluggish and overall filled with nuisances. The update was pushed incomplete, check the XDA forums for all the complains. It&#8217;s really mind boggling when a community has to get together and fix a company&#8217;s screw up.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that I changed the fonts due after I rooted the tablet (which is not ASUS&#8217;s fault) and took me a while to figure out that it was my custom fonts causing error 7. The update went very smooth and my tablet is a lot faster. I never had any I/O issues at all&#8230;</p>
<p>You need to have your tablet in a very stock condition to perform the OTA, if you modified anything, it will fail as I&#8217;ve learned. Seeing that most people on XDA has probably modified something, that&#8217;s probably why there&#8217;s a lot of complaints.</p>
<p>ASUS hasn&#8217;t screwed anything up this time, it&#8217;s not their responsibility if you modified your tablet&#8217;s firmware and having it cause an update failure.</p>
<p>I updated with no issues whatsoever, and JB solved some of the issues I&#8217;d had with the Prime under ICS.  I&#8217;m curious to know what&#8217;s incomplete about it&#8230;</p>
<p>Just checked my tf700. No update available :( Sucks</p>
<p>They delayed the tf700t update for a few days to fix a keyboard issue. They are saying it will come this week.  I have confirmed that it&#8217;s already arrived on the tf201.</p>
<p>Hey, what does the UI look like on a larger screen? Is it Honeycomb-style, or does it retain the blown-up phone UI of the Nexus 7?</p>
<p>Regular tablet style like in Honeycomb.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s HC style.  However, if that doesn&#8217;t appeal to you, AOKP just made it to where you can force the tablet/phone interface non-stop if you please.  Non-Tab works great for me on the 7&quot; screen, but I couldn&#8217;t imagine using it on a 9-10&quot; rig.</p>
<p>Mines working better than ever. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the Prime now. Much better experience than I had with the latest ICS version that Asus had released.</p>
<p>My wife has the Prime and I have the Infinity.  They are terrific devices.  Her Prime got the Jelly Bean update this weekend.  I read that the Infinity update was delayed by a few days to fix a keyboard issue.  As of this morning I hadn&#8217;t yet received it on the Infinity.</p>
<p>Moto doesn&#8217;t come near to comparing.<br />
They only bothered updating the US Xoom to JB.</p>
<p>An official Asus representative had promised JB for the TF101 on the xda-developers forums, I wonder if they will do it later or if they just ditched their word.</p>
<p>Think the Galaxy Nexus will have it within the year?</p>
<p>&#8220;The first phone to run android 4.1 jelly&#8230;&#8221; That&#8217;s what it said on the Google play store.. now the question remains is that Yakju/Takju only &#8230;</p>
<p>yakju will most likely get it ASAP.</p>
<p>Google engineer JBQ clarified Takju = Yakju + Google Wallet and NOTHING else, so I guess both Yakju and Takju will be the first to get Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Maguro as well.</p>
<p>Well that one might take a while&#8230; we all saw how long they took to get 4.0.4</p>
<p>Maguro is the GSM/HSPA+ version. Toro/Toroplus is the VZW/Sprint version that took forever to get the update.</p>
<p>Maguro is the hardware yakju/takju builds run on (also yakjuxw etc.), so your comment makes little sense.</p>
<p>Ok. I legit didn&#8217;t buy into the Android fragmentation argument until this thread right here. Can we get a salmon skin roll build?</p>
<p>Try again. Think desert.</p>

<p>ok, now what?</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4zBKyl.jpg" /></p>
<p>lol i had to scroll back up for that one</p>
<p>BURN! (please tell me you got that pun &#8211; Desert&#8230; Hot&#8230; Sun&#8230; Get it&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>slow clap</strong> Hah!</p>
<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MVkNy0njNgw/Td7CEmI6pBI/AAAAAAAAilM/KPM1Ho7dXtE/s1600/gobi-desert+%25281%2529.jpg" /></p>
<p>So one device having a name for its HW and a name for its SW means fragmentation? Makes no sense.</p>
<p>Insert mandatory &#8220;root your phone and install the updates as they leak&#8221; comment.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t have 4.04.</p>
<p>"root your phone and install the updates as they leak"</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>Maguro is the GSM Galaxy Nexus hardware that runs yakju/takju software. Toro is the CDMA GNex hardware that runs mysid.</p>
<p>So, when you say &#8220;yakju will get JB&#8221; you&#8217;re implying Maguro, because it&#8217;s not possible to run yakju on toro, since that doesn&#8217;t make sense (and it won&#8217;t run either)</p>
<p>Huh? I read mobile tech news daily and I think this is the first time I&#8217;ve heard the terms &#8220;Toro&#8221;, &#8220;Toroplus&#8221;, &#8220;Maguro&#8221;, &#8220;Yakju&#8221; or&quot;Takju&quot;.</p>
<p>They are code names of the hardware and software builds that run on the Galaxy Nexus. None of which are generally used in press releases or any of the tech blogs.</p>
<p>Oh ok. Thanks for the info.</p>
<p>I can tell from your post that you don&#8217;t have to bother with ORD.</p>
<p>O&#8217;hare????</p>
<p>I thought the SAME Thing! &#8220;What does going to an airport have to do with anything!?&#8221;</p>
<p>More fragmentation! Sigh&#8230;.</p>
<p>its two different builds</p>
<p>But even Apple can manage to different builds. . . Black <strong>and</strong> white.</p>
<p>(this post is sarcasm for those that don&#8217;t get it)</p>
<p>two*</p>
<p>EDIT.BUTTON.NOW.</p>
<p>Funny thing is they actually have two different builds of every iPhone now with different upgrade schedules. One being CDMA and the other GSM.</p>
<p>Not anymore. The 4S and 3rd generation iPad are hybrid devices running the same exact OS image.</p>
<p>Fun fact: &#8216;Maguro&#8217; is shown as the following on the Google Dictionary extension for Chome.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slang, refers to a woman who is rather less than enthusiastic during sex. Like a &#8220;dead fish&#8221;.&quot;</p>
<p>Tuna, it means tuna.</p>
<p>Maguro is the set of all GSM phones, which includes Yakju.</p>
<p>Yakjuux for example is also a Maguro, however, it didn&#8217;t get 4.0.4 for quite some time. I seriously doubt all of Marguro will get 4.1.0 on launch day.</p>
<p>JBQ is now know as JellyBean Queru</p>
<p>Known*</p>
<p>Can we please get an edit button? Grr.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s okay. We can skip past the minor errors.</p>
<p>ANY GSM Nexus can be flashed with yakju/takju firmware easily and safely (especially if you already are a seasoner rommer) &#8211; so the answer is anybody CAN get a supported copy of Jelly Bean this year. Yep. :)</p>
<p>its only the HSPA+ and GSM versions that will get the update, not LTE</p>
<p>The first <strong>tablet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which</strong> Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the two GSM versions and then there&#8217;s the Verizon CDMA one as well.</p>
<p>I think they mean the CDMA version. I am not holding my breath. Just re-rooted my Verizon Galaxy Nexus to install the first stable Jelly Bean rom I can find.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the Sprint CDMA version.</p>
<p>Nice trolling. There was even a leaked screenshot saying Galaxy Nexus is the first to have it soon. It will probably get it the day it&#8217;s released. Android 4.1 shouldn&#8217;t be a major overhaul, like 4.0 was from Gingerbread.</p>
<p>When will the 3 months old Lumia 900 have WP8, though?</p>
<blockquote>When will the 3 months old Lumia 900 have WP8, though?</blockquote>
<p>Never, which is awful.</p>
<p>But 2 wrongs don&#8217;t make a right.</p>
<p>Asking a question about WP7/8 phones in an Android article?  That&#8217;s a paddlin&#8217;.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/hFgR0m-9FmM/hqdefault.jpg" /></p>
<p>When one phone gets a totally different update that is not possible due to hardware but will get most of the software based updates versus&#8217;s hundreds of Android phones not getting updates that scale seems a little unfair. Hell you get new phones today still being released with gingerbread, that is a shame. When a flagship phone that is supposed to be the flag bearer of Android is still not getting regular updates is just a crying shame.</p>
<p>Google should make an application that one can use easily to change your phones&#8217;s ROM to stock. Does that seeem like a good idea?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about the rom though, different phones have different processors and gpus, and those also affect updates.</p>
<p>If you look at the majority of the new phones released today, they all have one of two different processors&#8230;either a snapdragon chip or an OMAP chip. So I wouldn&#8217;t say the all are different. They&#8217;re more alike than you think.</p>
<blockquote> but will get most of the software based updates </blockquote>
<p>Lumia 800/900 etc will get most of WP8 software updates with WP7,8?</p>
<p>Yes, software based update will come even the logical thinkers on XDA know this. It is totally pretty much impossible to change the kernel unless htc or Samsung are nice and drops at least the device drivers and lets us play and figure out ourselves how to get it to work out. This is why MS can not give us WP8 it is essentially W8 in a phone a whole new kernel.</p>
<blockquote>Yes, software based update will come even the logical thinkers on XDA know this. </blockquote>
<p>Microsoft doesn&#8217;t say so. Can you tell me which software features will bring apart the home screen visuals?</p>
<p>No, he can&#8217;t, because those features haven&#8217;t been announced for either WP 7.8 or WP8. The only feature we know about WP8 is indeed the new Homescreen.</p>
<p>However, what can be said, because Microsoft did announce it, is that all the core features of WP8 will indeed be in WP7.8. Now of course we don&#8217;t know what Microsoft means by &#8220;core features&#8221;.</p>
<p>The only thing we do know, is that WP7 phones launched in 2010 will get a pretty significant software update by the end of 2012, which is something that can&#8217;t be said with most, if not all, Android handsets from the same period.</p>
<blockquote>However, what can be said, because Microsoft did announce it, is that all the core features of WP8 will indeed be in WP7.8.</blockquote>
<p>Source? Because that is not what Microsoft or, even, Nokia have said</p>
<p>XDA XDA XDA if you dig on the pages you will find alot of answers. If you want info you will find we had 8779 update handed to use before people knew it was waiting.</p>
<p>XDA my &#8230;, can you link any MS official statement?</p>
<p>Microsoft has said that only the core home screen features will be ported, nothing more.</p>
<p>So, link any source or stop</p>
<blockquote>Instead, they will receive certain features from the new OS, most imporantly the new Start screen experience.</blockquote>

<p>Thanks for proving my point:</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;It&#8217;s basically bringing the core elements of Windows Phone 7.8 start experience, and UX, right to existing phones,&quot; says Sullivan. &quot;</p>
<p>You said the start screen and nothing more. They&#8217;re bringing over the start screen as well as other features of the user experience for Windows 8. Other features not announced. Just be patient and wait. No one knows the full extent of either update.</p>
<p>Do you understand what UX means?</p>
<p>You proved his point. :)</p>
<p>Not really, read above.</p>
<p>Source? what about the WP8 presentation keynote? did you already forget that one? or maybe you didn&#8217;t watch it?</p>
<p>MY God, in the keynote they said that they will port ONLY the home screen. Maybe the one that didn&#8217;t watch it was you</p>
<p>No I can&#8217;t say&#8230;..but as announced previous generations will get a subset of features and unannounced till after Google does their thing most software related features will be announced. In the Omnia forum we got a reach out that Sammy might be give out the drivers.</p>
<p>Go to XDA lots of Answers in the forum to that question. MS is not going to say so till after Google is tipping there hand. MS is being smarting this time many people don&#8217;t know but most features that came in iOS 5 and Ice Cream where based on Mango. MS not making that mistake again at all the SDK comes out end of next month for WP8, MS did not release any info on WP at all besides the visuals so did you really expect them to say more than that about the update for mango devices.</p>
<blockquote> but most features that came in iOS 5 and Ice Cream where based on Mango</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
<p>he mad bro</p>
<p>If you call a skin an update, then Android users can update their phones everyday if they want. And still be able to run the new apps.</p>
<p>You are right LtRaziel, nice trolling indeed.  You, I mean.  This is an article about android.  Relevance to Lumia, WP7 and WP7.8 or WP8 ?   There is none, like your troll comment.   Stick with the program son, this an android thread.</p>
<p>Lumia 900 will never get Jelly Bean. EVER.</p>
<p>My guess the GSM Nexus gets it next week and Verizon about sometime in 2017.</p>
<p>Or probably a month later (tops).</p>
<p>A month after 2017?</p>
<p>Just so you know a month after 2017 is not possible. Your move Mr Funnyman&#8230;</p>
<p>Sure it would, it&#8217;d be like February 2018&#8230;one month after 2017 ends.</p>
<p>I hate you&#8230; your despicable :-(</p>
<p>What about my despicable?</p>
<p>i dont think he got that</p>
<p>No 2017 is when android 9.0 Rice Cakes gets released.  You won&#8217;t get that one either.</p>
<p>Is the Galaxy Nexus getting it this year? If I were on Verizon, I would not hold my breath.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get why people keep saying this. Verizon Nexus got 4.0.4 a few weeks after the GSM Nexus.</p>
<p>40.4 came out on March 29, 2012 for GSM Galaxy Nexus. It took 2 months for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus to get the update (May 31st).</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m still on 4.0.2 (as far as Optus believes, I&#8217;m actually using CM9), so you AmeriFags should stop complaining about how long your updates take to come through. At least your carriers give a damn about you.</p>
<p>You probably should stop complaining and throwing around slurs like that. Hands off the keyboard, take a breath, read what you just wrote&#8230; the offer an apology. But first, let me apologize on behalf of the world that has so badly beaten you down&#8230; I&quot;m sorry that you have a fantastic phone with a fantastic operating system.  That is all.</p>
<p>Who knows, my GNEX didn&#8217;t get any updates for like 4 months after the initial update and it was a Google backed model&#8230; So i sold the lying phone. Sold it good</p>
<p>definitely, I&#8217;d say within the next few months, if Verizon doesn&#8217;t F*CK things up. but real Google devices definitely in a couple of months.</p>
<p>The GSM one yes. The LTE one.. Not likely.</p>
<p>Galaxy nexus might drown the sale of Galaxy S III, but anyways most of the money goes to Samsung.:)<br />
Nokia is also making some moves as they are getting ready to launch their New Nokia Series this Fall, Wanna watch out some leak shots, check my profile and visit my blog.</p>

<p>Both good theories.</p>
<p>hypotheses.</p>
<p>&#8220;A supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something&#8221;<br />
They are suppositions, and this isn&#8217;t a journal. Let&#8217;s not try to push the scientific definition out to regular English, just like we don&#8217;t like the regular English version creeping into a scientific setting.</p>
<p>The theory/hypothesis distinction is one that needs to be more widely spread, when people use the &#8220;it&#8217;s only a theory!&#8221; argument against evolution.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&#8217;s on overloaded term, it really does mean both. Theory in a scientific context just has a more rigorous definition. I agree that I want to spread the distinction, but Chris was still correct in his usage.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t mean both, and Chris was wrong.  I don&#8217;t typically play the grammar/vocab police in comments, but since  it was already brought up, I&#8217;m supporting it.</p>

<p>Astro<br />

<p>Astro and Bender? I see why the switched to sweet themed names. Thanks.</p>
<p>Astro and Bender are names of androids. I kinda wish they stuck with the android named theme.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, they switched it because they were worried about complaints from the copyright holders</p>
<p>Also sadly Bender has another meaning here in the UK&#8230;.</p>

<p>Like the Alien movies?</p>
<p>The first two versions (1.0 and 1.1) didn&#8217;t have any codenames. Even if they did, it wasn&#8217;t declared publicly. The first version with a public codename was 1.5 Cupcake.</p>
<p>Okay, I take that back. It was astro and bender.</p>
<p>I always thought it was Alpha and Beta</p>
<p>Alpha and Beta would be pre 1.0 they would be 0.x</p>

<img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/096/044/trollface.jpg?1296494117" /></p>
<p>How do you make something that isn&#8217;t a problem into one?  Meme it!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, I saw that logic this morning:<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/QVzvi.png" /><br />
Its not a problem no one has ICS, because the smart people don&#8217;t <strong>want</strong> ICS!!</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have an iPhone so I don&#8217;t know about Apple&#8217;s side of things but&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Galaxy S2 in my house, and after I updated it to ICS (Official update from my carrier, Bell Canada), it became even faster than before. The logic that &#8220;updates screw up your phone&#8221; sucks, and people who think that way should think again, because that&#8217;s NOT the way things work in this age.</p>
<p>It was true back in those Nokia days, when each update made the phone crappier, but not anymore.</p>
<p>No no no no no, that was not me, that was a screencap of an Android fanboy saying that the fact that only 7% of people who use Android have ICS is a good thing, then he gave that warped logic.  I was being facetious in response to the other guy;</p>
<p>Uhm&#8230; nokia 5800 worked better after every single update too for me :)</p>
<p>on topic: I do have an nexus s and when updated to ICS it was as if they added another processor core to my phone. I don&#8217;t expect that to happen again with Jelly Bean though..</p>
<p>Did your USB transfer speed drop after updating? Mine did. As did the battery life and a few other things.</p>
<p>The Android 4.0 update made my Nexus S smoother (while scrolling) and prettier but it also reduced the battery life, dropped the USB transfer speed and made the phone significantly slower. It&#8217;s hardly an update when the cons outweigh the pros.</p>
<p>If you ever used ICS you&#8217;d want it.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used it, do want it which is why r0lct is wrong.</p>
<p>This <strong>is</strong> a problem:<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/806iI.png" /><br />
This phone is the most expensive phone on AT&amp;T, still the Android halo phone (until the S III launches), and its soon to be 2 os versions behind.  Tell me why I shouldn&#8217;t be pissed?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you get a nexus. Its simple stop supporting the companies that hold updates simple as all hell. If you wanted something like the iPhone than get the iPhone. If the phone still works don&#8217;t see the problem. And that 7% should be more like 20% now due to all the galaxy s2 getting ics</p>
<p> I swear the only people who complain are the ones who DONT own the phone.. ICS is wayyy better than GB but it doesn&#8217;t  add any worthwhile features it&#8217;s just themed better and has a few better apps..</p>
<p>And is only like 10 times smoother, even on 2 years old devices.</p>
<p>NOt entirely true. I tried three different ICS ROMS for the SGS i9000 and while being smooth, there always were stability issues and missing drivers. For example frozen lockscreens and browser crashes became particularly annoying.</p>
<p>So I went back to 2.3.6 (It was that bad)</p>
<p>I agree. I tried pretty much all the ICS ROMs for  my Vision/G2/Desire Z, and they all sucked cock. Back to 2.3.7 for that phone. Don&#8217;t care now though, cos I have my SGS3 with sweet sweet ICS!</p>
<p>Really? On my 2+ year old Legend (600mhz), a beta ICS rom actually worked better and smoother than CM7.1. Now on this One X however it seems that the stock Sense rom was better.. but CM9&#8217;s benefits outweigh its deficiencies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure you can say anything categorically about the relative stability ICS and Gingerbread if you&#8217;ve only used third-party, hacked ROMs.  The test on this stuff really has to be first-party builds.</p>
<p>Drivers have been a really big issue for ICS rom shortcomings. Thinking of my Droid 3.</p>
<p>But who are you pissed at? Its not Google&#8217;s fault</p>
<p>I agree Google should launch only one major version of Android per year. This way more manufacturers and more phone models will be able to be upgraded to the latest one by the time a new major one is released. 6 months is not a lot of time for them to do it, especially when there are major changes to the architecture of the OS, like it happened in ICS.</p>
<p>Well all things considered, this doesn&#8217;t appear to be a major revision of the OS &#8230;just a .x update. Of course we&#8217;ll find out more tomorrow.</p>
<p>That is the part that every person who is complaining doesn&#8217;t get. They changed a ton of architectural things inside Android for ICS.</p>

Because AT&amp;T just released the ICS update for the S2?</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus and love it.  I&#8217;m referring to the insinuation that fragmentation is some huge problem.</p>
<p>Fragmentation is a problem within the Galaxy Nexus, depending on which build  you have. I shouldn&#8217;t have to root and flash a custom rom because I was stuck on 4.0.1 since January.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I am an Android Fanboy but this article you are citing is ridiculous. There are soo many Android OS&#8217;s out there because Google doesn&#8217;t restrict all devices to use the newest and greatest OS, and they couldn&#8217;t even if they wanted too. Which is all part of the beauty of an open source language!</p>
<p>Sense, you make none.</p>
<p>HTC makes a lot of Sense.</p>
<p>That is the biggest load of nonsense I&#8217;ve ever read.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t tell if serious&#8230;</p>
<p>Why do you think development lags so far behind Android releases? Even if you&#8217;re experienced with Java getting comfortable working with the SDK takes the better part of a year, and then on top of that you&#8217;ve got to learn all nuances of supporting multiple devices. Honeycomb introduced changes that you wouldn&#8217;t understand without being comfortable with the previous SDKs. Because they introduced things like Fragments that are separate but expand upon existing concepts, so you really can&#8217;t skip getting a clear understanding of the stuff that these new ideas are meant to replace. In a nutshell that is why there&#8217;s been this sort of barrier-to-entry with ICS that didn&#8217;t exist so much in previous versions, but more relevantly why adoption rates are really important. If the install base for 3.0+ devices was higher there would be a bigger push to bring that barrier down.</p>
<p>When you work a <em>programming</em> job you&#8217;re not being paid to enhance you&#8217;re understanding. They just want you to build or maintain something that works even if it&#8217;s coded like balls. Honestly, who wants to get home from work and do more work? Adoption rates are really key to this whole thang. If they improve there will be more tutorials and code examples for using the new support APIs, and you the fandroids will get the apps you want more quickly. Apple has problems, Google has problems. There&#8217;s no reason to defend either of them like they&#8217;re your best bud after he found out his mom has cervical cancer. It doesn&#8217;t serve you any good.</p>
<p>This was meant for AdamReid. Without distinct sub comment box dealies like Reddit has I can&#8217;t tell if I replied to the right one.</p>
<p>Google releases updates in a constant rate of every 6 months.<br />
Why would they stop releasing newer updates just to wait for OEMS to &#8216;catch up&#8217; ?</p>
<p>Exactly its not their problem. The only thing google needs to worry about is their own devices if you choose another non nexus device its your fault no one elses</p>
<p>Nobody cares whose fault it is. It&#8217;s an Android problem: if variety is a benefit of Android then fragmentation is a detriment.</p>
<p>They are not alone. BB7 devices won&#8217;t get BBX (I can almost garentee it, it is exactly like Windows Mobile to Windows Phone 7). Some iPhones won&#8217;t get all the features, so it doesn&#8217;t really count if the get the newest os or not. Current WP devices won&#8217;t get the full os update to WP8. I know these are hardware differences, but to the average consumer (those who wouldn&#8217;t flash a rom to get the latest update) wouldn&#8217;t know the difference. My point, every smartphone OS has some fragmentation, some just have it less then others. Besides, like others have said, the Nexus line is Googles only way of getting rid of Carrier Control (and it really needs to be a true Nexus, no Carrier branding where they get control). That is all Google can do.</p>
<p>mean while a lot of users around the world buy unlocked Nexus and get all updates.</p>
<p>If the OEMs don&#8217;t keep up though, they&#8217;ll gradually keep upgrading. So long as there&#8217;s a minimum API to aim at and APIs aren&#8217;t deprecated till much later, nobody cares.</p>
<p>It certainly is their problem. And it&#8217;s becoming a bigger problem as the media, and their competition, decides to focus on to it more and more.</p>
<p>At least if they did it once per year, manufacturers would not have any excuse anymore, and the backlashes against them could be huge.</p>
<p>No, they should take more control over their OS/the OEMs to make their update cycle worth it.</p>
<p>Or work with the OEMs&#8230;but actually make it work.</p>
<p>Basically the &#8216;update alliance&#8217; but with it actually happening.</p>
<p>As much as I want that to happen, the only way to do that is to make it closed-source, which defeats the whole purpose of Android in the first place.</p>
<p>So Google pretty much can&#8217;t do anything, I guess they can resort to the update alliance which was formed to speed up the logistics, but as you said, nothing is really happening.</p>
<p>Well, there is rumored to be 5 Nexus devices, allowing multiple manufacturers to get there hands on the code earlier. What they need to do is seed the beta versions to at least those 5 for manufacturers to start working on a skin.</p>
<p>Because they need developers and good apps. Developers like good new APIs which allow them to make good apps. If developers are always targeting  last year&#8217;s version or relying on compatibility  hacks you tend to get shitty buggy apps. You also face the problem of not being able to push out new (highly) integrated OS services into third party apps. Release it today and maybe in 2 years it will be a commonly integrated feature in third party apps. That&#8217;s really not sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it&#8217;ll take before those jellybeans are stolen.</p>
<p>I guess they spilled the beans :(</p>
<p>Dibs on that licorice one off by itself!</p>
<p>I had a dream in which Google put a stop to Android skins, and took control of the OS updates.</p>
<p>That would piss off manufacturers and carriers, and they would rush over to Windows Phone.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t understand the OEM logic on that if that&#8217;s what they would do. They can&#8217;t skin Windows Phone either, so what would be the difference?</p>
<p>Well, one reason why OEMs and carriers LOVE Android is because they can skin it and make the experience &#8220;theirs&#8221; so customers begin to love their devices and NOT those of competitors using the same OS.</p>
<p>They want people to think of a phone to be Samsung&#8217;s or Verizon&#8217;s, and not Google&#8217;s or Microsoft&#8217;s. That&#8217;s why they stick to Android but skin it heavily.</p>
<p>If Google enforces stock, this advantage would go away, and the BIGGEST plus point of Android (for them) would go away.</p>
<p>Of course they won&#8217;t rush to Windows Phone immediately because even after that Android is better in many ways (ecosystem, hardware choices, etc) but it would sure make them less committed to Android.</p>
<p>I never thought of it like that but it makes SENSE&#8230; (hehe couldn&#8217;t resist) but seriously it does make sense</p>
<p>Generally speaking I think a lot of people like these skins from Samsung and HTC.  I liked HTC&#8217;s sense when I used android, and from the video&#8217;s Samsungs touchwiz seemed pretty slick.  But I keep getting called gross for liking them :(</p>
<p>oh I love Sense! don&#8217;t get me wrong. Android FanBoys rail on things not stock but I would always flash Sense ROM&#8217;s. maybe a AOSP one every once in a while but Sense is alright by me!</p>
<p>each to their own I guess. I really like stock, Sense is okay but TouchWiz is horrible, it just looks so Gingerbread, even on ICS. The thing I like about Android is that its not afraid to change its look, whilst iOS is a great platform it basically hasn&#8217;t changed UI-wise since the start, and I think its UI is getting tired.</p>
<p>Plus other reasons like Android is free and Windows phone charges a royalty.</p>
<p>Perhaps if Google defends them in court and they don&#8217;t have to pay royalties to Microsoft, or engage in battle with Apple, then Android will be free.</p>
<p>Exactly the best example is Samsung look at their OS&#8230;they are building everything in it on the software side but yet its Google s problem when updates come around. Everyone has to stop seeing android as the whole system. The real Android is the nexus program and everything else is this forked android which some are getting better and some arent</p>
<p>But, why not let me remove the skin?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the issue. If they did it through launcher programs, and modified it (even sold it in the market), they could determine what the market liked, and offer alternatives that might actually make their phones better.</p>
<p>Windows Phone has even more software constrictions than an unskinned Android. The OEMs and carriers wouldn&#8217;t have any more freedom. If anything they would have much less.</p>
<p>Fine by me&#8230;</p>
<p>Not fine by me. I like the fact that OEMs get to do their own thing to Android. Means I get to pick and choose the best features of each all combined in a custom ROM &#8211; best of all worlds!</p>
<p>Why, Windows Phone offers no customization for them (unless you are the spoiled Nokia). They would keep the most recent version and modify it themselves. Then, Googke would say they kept skinning and want to cut off the marketplace and other Google Apps, but wouldn&#8217;t because it still makes them money.</p>
<p>A more plausible response would be to just fork Android and create TouchWiz, Sense, Timescape OSs.</p>
<p>They announced during the ICS keynote that they would try and control updates more and put an end to the burdening skin experience.  Sadly, this hasn&#8217;t really come to fruition :(</p>
<p>I would say skinning isn&#8217;t the biggest issue for Android, the biggest issue is timely updates and Google has yet to come up with a proper solution.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re saying a symptom is more important issue than the disease.  Skins need to be ported to new OS versions which is costly and takes a long time.  Either companies will port the skins over time or they&#8217;ll just forget about it and develop a new skin for the new OS.  This can be seen with TouchWiz, where TW5 is SGSIII only and how it took Samsung months to come out with ICS with TW4.</p>
<p>&#8230;and just think how quicker updates would be if these companies couldn&#8217;t screw up the UI with skins. Less work, less time, less money, more likely to do more updates.</p>
<p>Its been less than a year and they did not say that. It was said that ics allowed easier customization for Samsung and HTC etc&#8230;.but first the companies had to get ics onto devices which was a major feat&#8230;.Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day</p>
<p>No, they said that Holo them can&#8217;t be removed, nothing morre</p>
<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-20061501-251/ice-cream-sandwich-first-impressions-a-bold-new-android/" target="_blank">http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-20061501-251/ice-cream-sandwich-first-impressions-a-bold-new-android/</a></p>
<p>Google announced (in conjunction with its hardware partners), that as long as the hardware could support it, the devices would be updated the the newest versions of Android within 18 months of their purchase/announcement.</p>
<p>Ein? That has nothing to do with ICS</p>
<p>Nope, in your source it said that Googke will &#8220;encourage&#8221;, it said nothing about forcing.</p>
<p>I said &#8220;they would try and control updates more&#8221; which has nothing to do with forcing manufacturers to do anything.  Working with their partners to allow for timely updates would be controlling the update process more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a silly dream because <strong>sigh</strong> Google does not own Android they do most of the development but the Open Handset Alliance control Android and that has tons of members which surprisingly enough are OEM manufacturers like HTC, Samsung etc.</p>
<p>And my EVO 3D still runs Froyo&#8230;.</p>
<p>root it, mine&#8217;s running ICS flawlessly</p>
<p>He already did root it to put Froyo on apparently.</p>
<p>either he doesn&#8217;t know what Froyo is or he is already rooted and choose Froyo&#8230;</p>
<p>It came with Ginderbread</p>
<p>I meant gingerbread. I&#8217;ve never rooted anything before&#8230;. Can I have a link that shows me everything to do?</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to familiarize yourself with XDA&#8217;s forum for your device.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1095" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1095</a></p>
<p>Look around and then when you feel comfortable, go ahead and root. Some of the how to&#8217;s have terminology you may not understand so read through it first to avoid any panic moments later. It&#8217;s not hard to root, but you should have a bit of knowledge beforehand.</p>
<p>At least make sure you understand the differences between ROM, Recovery, Bootloader and Kernel. This will help you understand a lot.</p>
<p>Especially if you&#8217;re new I&#8217;d recommend starting out with the official HTC unlock. There&#8217;s decent instructions <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1239821">here</a>.</p>
<p>The other method involves bricking and unbricking your phone, and for someone new who just wants to try new ROMs it&#8217;s not worth the risk or hassle.</p>
<p>Or wait like a week? They&#8217;re starting to roll out ICS for the Evo 3D.</p>
<p>What do you think the odds are that the GNex that took that picture was running 4.1</p>
<p>I like the way that the picture is at 2048&#215;1536 res (iPad Retina)</p>
<p>That is what images gets re sized to in picasa web-album, when you don&#8217;t change it in settings, so it doesn&#8217;t have any relations.</p>
<p>Fair enough</p>
<p>Jeez, CyanogenMod just got done with the first 4.0 release candidate.  Crazy how 4.1 is already on the horizon and even custom ROMs are struggling to keep up.  That said 4.0 is the first truly complete Android experience so I think the changes here on out will be minimal when it comes to the underlying OS / framework</p>
<p>Ya shouldn&#8217; t be as big of a jump for OEMs or custom ROM people.</p>
<p>True. Apart from those DAMNED pixelated contact thumb Nails! Dialer and people apps are pretty bad in general. And Google, could we get an egg timer and a Flashlight please?</p>
<p>MIUI has great ones built in.</p>
<p>Yea, but then you have to put up with the uglyness that is MIUI</p>
<p>Those contact thumbnails are an embarrassment, and yet Google just ignores the issue, despite complaints for literally YEARS now. It&#8217;s such a simple fix as well, it really pisses me off.</p>
<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/26/technology/google-android/index.htm" target="new">This</a> article is so much more pertinent in light of this news</p>
<p>They&#8217;re gonna get ants!</p>
<p>Every time I see an update like this I get excited.. then I realize I&#8217;m on Verizon and don&#8217;t want to root&#8230; I dunno I think Jellybean may make me root.</p>
<p>why not root on Verizon?</p>
<p>BTW, I have a Gnex&#8230; just stock.</p>
<p>Just rip off the band-aid.  Unlock the bootloader, install a custom recovery, and flash Peter Alfonso&#8217;s Bugless Beast rom &#8211; <a href="http://download.peteralfonso.com/maguro/rom" target="_blank">http://download.peteralfonso.com/maguro/rom</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s near stock and he&#8217;ll keep you up to date.  Subsequent updates are totally painless.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fine and all, but what are the specs?</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the matter say that each bean has 4 cores, the cup doesn&#8217;t have an SD slot, if anyone tells you anything else its just speculation.</p>
<p>Looks like they&#8217;re ready to spill the beans&#8230;</p>
<p>I am stunned it took this long for this gag to turn up.</p>
<p>Hmmm i might splurge on the tablet so i can have something to play with at school during break times&#8230;.but im also gonna use 4.1 on the gnexus as the best excuse for tmobile to give me the gs3  for 199 :D</p>
<p>Well I admit I wrong about the release time of Jellybean.</p>
<p>I love being right.<br />
I honestly forget who it was, but someone told me in the comments section of a piece that Android is updated once-a-year and that there&#8217;s no way Jelly Bean would come before November. Strictly speaking, I could still be wrong, but it&#8217;s looking less likely.</p>
<p>Regardless, kudos on admitting that you were wrong. You could still be right, of course.</p>
<p>Well whenever the monuments come out that means the update is weeks or days away. Now I&#8217;m even more intrigued about what they will launch in the Fall with the new Nexus.</p>
<p>Well, this TECHNICALLY could be just like iOS 5.1, a firmware update with bug fixes only, though I would guess that it doesn&#8217;t deserve a new code name.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a play on spilling the beans.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a play on spilling the beans.</p>
<p>That would be so Apple of them&#8230;</p>
<p>Are they daft? Why would we already need another version? What new features could they possibly have? ICS is phantastic and the one year release cycle seemed to be perfect.</p>
<p>This will just trigger another wave of  &#8220;Where is my Update?&#8221; Rage.</p>
<p>All we need is high res contact pictures and a decent GTasks App :)</p>
<p>Majel.</p>
<p>Speaking of &#8216;Where is my update&#8217;&#8230; most Android users are on 2.3&#8230; What a joke.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a thing of candy beans!</p>
<p>It would be hysterical if Samsung would just skip Jelly Bean if it brings nothing new to the table &#8211; which it probably wont.</p>
<p>I mean if Jelly Bean comes out next week, Google is basically screwing its manufacturers, upgrading means a huge cost for them and a new onslaught of customer rage.</p>
<p>Dude, get real.  Ice Cream Sandwich was open-sourced by Google over 7 months ago now.  Android is not going to stagnate.  Ever.</p>
<p>I love Android and all&#8230; but that lawn is getting a little tacky, right?</p>
<p>If by &#8220;tacky&#8221; you mean &#8220;awesome.&#8221;</p>
<p>By &#8220;tacky&#8221; I mean &#8220;distasteful,&#8221; but not &#8220;distasteful&#8221; <em>literally</em>, because all those things are delicious. And by &#8220;tacky&#8221; I also mean &#8220;sticky.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you  meant &#8220;sticky&#8221;, then I think you meant &#8220;taffy&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Jelly Bean will be able to challenge the mighty lead iOS 6 has taken.</p>
<p>iphone does not have LTE. by the time it does, the world would have moved on to better things. Apple takes the lead only in screen resolution, which makes sense for their shiny products.</p>
<p>Well, they could have been waiting for LTE release 10 (the extremely battery efficient version that t-Mobile is using).</p>
<p>What will the world have moved on to by October?</p>
<p>Exactly how has taken this lead?</p>
<p>Supposedly the iOS 6 beta already has wider adoption (through grey-market UDID activations) than ICS. I&#8217;m not sure I buy it, haven&#8217;t seen data.</p>
<p>I think he doesn&#8217;t talks about adoption, but about a technical lead</p>
<p>Too many different things to compare everything. One area I&#8217;d say Apple has a technical lead with is iCloud. An iPhone and iPad just work better together than an Android phone and Android tablet. You could add the Apple TV / Mac into the mix too. Google has all the parts they just haven&#8217;t figured out how to put them together yet to create that degree of integration platform wide.</p>
<p>What lead? There&#8217;s no way a beta, that is locked to use only on select devices can have a lead on anything.</p>
<p>I had a dig around in the I/O app earlier which is build with API level 16 (ICS was 14 and 15), those cheeky people got it before us!</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Mm2ZkMUq-WM/T-oAmEDI0NI/AAAAAAAAA8M/A9S_Zi4K36w/s761/12+-+1" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s an awesome find.</p>
<p>great find indeed!</p>
<p>Is it funny i was not annoyed that my old phone did not have ICS but its a bit annoying being on the minority OS as apps are in no rush to update to Holo theme?</p>
<p>They spilled the beans.</p>
<p>Google have lost their freaking minds.  Android gets slagged rotten for how long it takes for devices to get an update (if they ever do) and they pull this?    Why can&#8217;t do just do one large update a year and give their partners and customers time to be current?</p>
<p>Because they&#8217;re pushing to an integrated model &#8211; or at least a model where they have more control over updates. I could see OEMs ceding some control over to Google to remain current &#8211; that would be a huge differentiation.</p>
<p>It makes sense.</p>
<p>I hope  you are right but I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>That is one fattening lawn&#8230;</p>
<p>can you eat cardboard?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no lawn, that Fatty Heaven.</p>
<p>what is froyo as a dessert??</p>
<p>Frozen Yogurt.</p>
<p>yuck. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been planning on dropping Sprint to go back to prepaid and GSM.  The time is near, and I shall finally have a true Nexus directly from Google.  HSPA+, baby!</p>
<p>The real question is, will Jellybean be a whole new OS, revamp from the ground up, or small tweaks here and there to Ice Cream Sandwich? I&#8217;m hoping for the first.</p>
<p>Small tweaks, obviously.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t nearly enough time to do an entire reboot of Android.</p>
<p>The monument looks like it has a bunch of pills in it. Maybe 4.1 is Android on steroids?</p>
<p>I wonder will the Nexus S get 4.1.  I love my phone and have no problems on ICS but I would not  mind an upgrade.</p>
<p>GSM Nexus S = Most Likely<br />
CDMA (Fake) Nexus S = Wait 6 Months</p>
<p>GSM Galaxy Nexus = Most Likely<br />
CDMA (Fake) Galaxy Nexus = Wait 6 Months</p>
<p>You forgot one<br />
Rooted CDMA (Fake) Galaxy Nexus = Date of source release plus a few weeks.</p>
<p>But what if the radio in 4.1 is different?</p>
<p>That means you&#8217;re basically screwed, since you don&#8217;t have the CDMA radio files are closed-source.</p>
<p>How can we differenciate GSM from CDMA ? I don&#8217;t know which one mine is.</p>
<p>Verizon/Sprint = CDMA, AT&amp;T/T-mobile + most of the world = GSM</p>
<p>Since this is supposedly a minor update I am guessing it will.</p>
<p>Good thing they cleaned it up. Wouldv&#8217;e drived me nuts.</p>
<p>Good old Google. I wonder if Chris had fun explaining to his family that he spent his morning urgently verifying the meaning of the spilled status of a bunch of giant jelly beans.</p>
<p>looks like they <strong>ahem</strong> spilled the beans a bit early with this one. (I&#8217;ll show myself out now)</p>
<p>Yes, please meet up outside with the other 10 people who made that joke here ;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to make a bold statement and say that by this time next year, 10% of all Android devices will be running this version.</p>
<p>Soooooo, let the updates come android! Me can&#8217;t wait, me want jelly bean, me and yakju (GN) wait.</p>
<p>So bad that many phone didn&#8217;t get ICS yet and they already releasing JB.</p>
<p>While the design superiority of Apple or Android handsets may be considered a subjective matter, Google&#8217;s front lawn being a tacky mess when compared to Apple HQ (or just about any HQ) is undeniable fact.</p>
<p>So a little piece of plastic, call it a statue, is now a monument. And it does deserve front page for a few days. Where are we going people? Slow News Day?</p>
<p>this with the next nexus device will probably be my next! (that&#8217;s big coming from an iphone user)</p>
<p>bring it on :D :D</p>
<p>Better late than never.</p>
<p>Oh can it already. It&#8217;s 3 months after 4.1 was released into the wild. There are still people running IE6 and using the iPhone 3G.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus on Verizon just got it&#8217;s update last week ffs.</p>
<p>You can it. Just because idiots are still using IE6 has nothing to do with this.</p>
<p>What is so bad about IE6.</p>
<p>Stop Trolling Dan! :P</p>
<p>It has everything to do with this. People that care about the Jellybean update and can&#8217;t wait the extra delay porting it to their device will do something about it. They might root their phone and update it themselves. They might switch to a Nexus device. Problem solved. People that don&#8217;t give a crap about the update&#8230;DON&#8217;T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THE UPDATE. The phone&#8217;s software (or internet browser) adequately fulfills their needs at the moment. So who actually has a problem with a 3 month delay? People who just like to bitch and moan and use the same old weak arguments of &#8220;FRAGMENTATION LOL&#8221; or &#8220;OMG I STILL DON&#8217;T UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF A NEXUS DEVICE&#8221;</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus took nearly as long to get 4.1 on Verizon.</p>
<p>Just sayin&#8230;</p>
<p>Verizons fault, not googles</p>
<p>Does kinda blow a hole in the &#8220;Nexuses always get updates quickly!&#8221; argument, though.</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t need to wait for them to put their stupid skin on top of Android. It should at least be a choice to use Sense or not.</p>
<p>never going to happen&#8230; HTC considers Sense to be a selling feature, and sense makes it an Android based phone, not an android phone like Nexus phones/tablets</p>
<p>It was, early on, possible to turn Sense off on the original Evo 4G.  After it upgraded to&#8230; Froyo, though, the option disappeared.  I liked that ability.  You&#8217;re probably right, now.  That may never happen again.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I wouldn&#8217;t be terribly surprised if it did happen eventually.  The shift is barely (not popularly by any stretch) happening with PC&#8217;s like Vizio and some of the rebranded Clevo&#8217;s&#8230; however, as bundled software with Windows is a money maker for companies, I&#8217;m sure Sense, as a selling point for HTC, will be hard to get rid of.</p>
<p>Oh well&#8230; I can hope.  I like stock Android (granted, it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;stock&#8221; even when you turned Sense off on the Evo 4G), but I like HTC&#8217;s hardware better.</p>
<p>I believe that applied to all HTC phones using Android before Froyo</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>And if you could even choose to turn individual elements of sense on or off, with the option to run the &#8220;full sense experience&#8221; it might &#8211; just might actually be a selling feature.</p>
<p>If they were the first android OEM to actually do something like this, people would flip.  Could be a huge competitive advantage for them in the android space.</p>
<p>Get the size back down to 4.3 to 4.5 inches and I might even buy such a device.</p>
<p>This kid&#8217;s a bitch</p>
<p>Guy compares people not getting updates in a timely fashion to people still running IE6 on XP, and people who bought the iphone in 2008.</p>
<p>This is sad.</p>
<p>So true.  Atrix owners hating that.</p>

<p>Wow, that&#8217;s actually pretty fast. There is a lot of work involved on such an update. ok, a lot less for 4.0 &gt; 4.1 than 2.3 &gt; 4.x but still impressive.</p>
<p>Agreed! Samsung&#8217;s JB update is minimal also. Add the buttery and Google Now with a sprinkle of tweaks and it&#8217;s still a winner!</p>
<p>The need for JB over ICS is not as much as it was for ICS over GB, but its still nice to get the update, although I have CM10 installed right now.</p>
<p>UK operators are usually very quick when it comes to updates, so looking forward to this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently waiting for T-mobile UK to deploy the 4.0.4 update (due 8th Oct). hopefully the update to JB will be out a little quicker,</p>
<p>Ah I know Three and Voda have rolled it out.  Surprised T-Mobile have not. You can if you know what you are doing flash it over the top manually.</p>
<p>If it looks like it will be a long wait again, I&#8217;ll consider rooting and flashing CM10 onto it. I&#8217;m not overly keen on the sense 4 UI</p>
<p>Since it will be a major update hopefully it will be rolled out quickly.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t have Three advertising  that it has Jelly Bean, yet T-Mob only has ICS.</p>
<p>Beaten by Samsung. Wat do, HTC?</p>
<p>It would be in the best interest of Google to have Google Now (Jelly Bean) in as many devices as possible. It&#8217;s the ultimate data mining tool.</p>
<p>Cool Story Bro</p>
<p>Citation needed</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll notice much of project butter in the JB version on the One X for this update.<br />
In the latest software update HTC buttered sense themselves and therefor already runs silky smooth.</p>
<p>A new update. I wonder if more then 1% or users will ever upgrade to it?</p>
<p>Its an OTA.</p>
<p>Will that include One V too you recon? Hope so.</p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p>wow HTC, you are starting to really get annoying&#8230; promising latest android versions for their phones for 2 years if they launched after october 2011 or something like that&#8230; and they pull this off, same with Desire HD, WOW&#8230;</p>
<p>Same as Motorola/Google.</p>
<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/motorola-reneges-on-ice-cream-sandwich-software-update/" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/motorola-reneges-on-ice-cream-sandwich-software-update/</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running CM10 on my One V since I bought it in August. Jelly Bean (stock) is very fitting for this phone.. Sense 4 however, was not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure HTC revleaed this news a week or two ago,</p>
<p>Any word about the Evo 4G LTE? It&#8217;s based on the One X, so hopefully that means we&#8217;ll be getting it soon too.</p>
<p>No, these are for the carrier agnostic one series.</p>
<p>fancy</p>
<p>Really disappointed that the S3 hasn&#8217;t gotten jelly bean yet,  at least HTC is getting on the ball.</p>
<p>Good news! I was going to put CM10 on my one x, but not sure if I should try this first</p>
<p>This is good news.  Now, I wonder <strong>how </strong>long Rogers is going to sit on it after HTC releases?  (still haven&#8217;t got the patch to handle the &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; on-screen button)</p>
<p>Should I buy htc one x, one s, or iPhone 5?</p>
<p>HTC has been pushing the Carriers about getting updates out faster on their newer devices. Look at the HTC Vivid. It was released GB on AT&amp;T November 6th &amp; I got the OTA in late February. For AT&amp;T that was unheard of. HTC is a company I have a long time love/hate relationship with. I communicate with many folks their &amp; have been a pretty big critic. There are several points &amp; predictions I have made to them, all of which have come to pass. From stock analysis to consumer backlash to marketing failure predictions. I am sure I am not the only one as I don&#8217;t have any magic crystal ball, just common sense &amp; a competent grasp of the tech communities &amp; marketplace. HTC has heard &amp; they are starting to listen. They are going out of their way to release leaks to the development community all the time. They are starting to make devices that look &amp; feel different with a heavy emphasis in quality entertainment. The One X for instance has a better camera, better lens &amp; better sounding speaker. Many people say they like the S3 display over the HTC One X, but I can&#8217;t take any of them seriously or begin to believe they actually compared the two. More likely they read a blog of someone that was given a free S3 by Samsung. The S3 is a cool device with all of it&#8217;s unique features, but it is a pentile display with less pixel density. It does black &amp; dark spectrum colors nicely because it emits less light for them, but bright colors &amp; HQ images in general, just look better on the One X. The camera features are not only interesting with best shot type burst modes &amp; still image from video capability, but the images are just cleaner &amp; videos have less artifacts. This is probably because of the camera greater f ability. It also is true 28mm which makes for a nice image with that includes more of your surroundings, which is great if you are on vacation. The One X would be perfect if it had, say, 64Gb of storage &amp; a bigger battery.</p>
<p>Also, more HTC consumers like the Sense ecosystem better that the AOSP Android experience. Maybe that is in part because HTC users are used to Sense, but I for one prefer it ovewr AOSP. My tablet is AOSP &amp; that is great there. But on my phone I like the rich &amp; consistent look of Sense &amp; I like the Sense widgets. I like uniformity within a style set I choose. I don&#8217;t like a hodgepodge of styles that all differ with each software &amp; widget manufacturer. Many people agree. There is a poll conducted recently by HTC that asked users what direction they would like to see HTC go in. There were numerous option including, I believe, a more stock ASOP experience &amp; I think roughly 2 0r 3 to 1  wanted to see HTC build up its own Sense style ecosystem. The option of disabling Sense without using one of the all-in-one root kits would be a great option, but I for one think AOSP belongs where it is, on Nexus devices. I don&#8217;t want every Android looking the same. It through trying new things &amp; integrating new features that innovation is born. You don&#8217;t agree, well Apple has made a fortune from it by waiting for devices like the One X &amp; S3  to be developed &amp; released &amp; then cherry picking the best new features &amp; incrementally updating their devices with them in a way &amp; at a rate that optimizes profitability &amp; subsequently their market price. iOS even is not just plain vanilla.. It is Apple&#8217;s skin on top of Unix BSD. The market these days is not about a basic model that can then be added to with a ton of mismatched third party widgets. It is about the whole experience &amp; ecosystem from the device, to the UI, to the apps &amp; even the carrier. It is in the kind of market that engineered systems were in about half a decade ago, a turnkey market, for bettter or worse. I for one like HTC for their style, including Sense, &amp; their choice of materials. Sense is just more refined &amp; finished looking to me than any other UI out there, including AOSP. I do not like HTC Watch &amp; think it was a huge waste, but their eReader &amp; MyShelf widget were not only useful &amp; good looking, they also were more functional than 90% of the ereaders out there with an smooth &amp; easy process to import your own content without jumping through hoops. Their media player (music) works &amp; sounds wonderfully. Their gReader news app was also one of the best looking news widgets around. HTC&#8217;s big mistake was trying to be their own Google &amp; wanting to reap the proffits of a content provider like Apple does. This is not where they excel. They excel at making great hardware with a UI that is as simple or complicated as you want it with software &amp; widgets that work together &amp; compliment each other. They had visions of their own iTunes however &amp; some dreamer sold the CEO on his wide eyed dream of making Watch into HTC&#8217;s own iTunes-like cash cow. They don&#8217;t have the knowledge or historical background to enable them to do this. They ddo have the ability to make eye popping UI&#8217;s &amp; rich software based services &amp; features. They should have built upon Sense &amp; HTCSense.com, with the online theme customization &amp; application, location based 7 lost device services as well as taking the most commonly used feature apps &amp; integrate them into beautiful &amp; easy to use widgets &amp; sooftware like FriendStream &amp; the News &amp; Reader widgets, which they dropped in favor of building up HTC Watch, the least used widget/software they have probably ever released. Their location &amp; mapping service is nice &amp; worth the 30.00. I would have paid them to make an ICS/JB version of HTC Greader, MyShelf &amp; eReader too. If they want to make some money on content, then they should partner with whomever makes the best content &amp; then design their own Sense based software &amp; widgets collaboratively &amp; worked out a licensing agreement. If they want to build their own content service, well good luck. You have to compete with huge companies that have been doing it better &amp; better for years, iTunes, Amazon &amp; even Google&#8217;s Play Store. I would not want to be trying to break into that market right now, not with price wars starting to heat up &amp; I certainly wouldn&#8217;t go about it piecemeal with HTC Watch leading the charge. Music would be a much better entry point &amp; there they are stuck doing what they do good, collaborating with BP or Amazon.</p>
<p>i have left the hope but it&#8217;s really a great news that finally this update is releasing. get it soon !!!!<br />

<p>Not many developers will be ready to develop for iOS + Android + BB10. Right now they have to choose between BB10 and WP8, Having an Android player gives BB10 an upper hand. Eventually once some of the ported apps are successful, they will put in the extra effort to make a native BB10 app.</p>
<p>Or if they just used C/C++ to start with, they could target all 4 platforms.</p>
<p>Honestly, it isn&rsquo;t that hard to port an Objective-C project to BB10 either: <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting_ios_intro.html" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting_ios_intro.html</a></p>
<p>Thing is, I know a lot of people who avoid Objective C. I don&rsquo;t make mobile apps but I imagine i would too</p>
<p>Are these people not building iOS apps? I can&rsquo;t imagine building an iOS app <em>without</em> Obj-C. Apple&rsquo;s Cocoa framework is built for Obj-C. If you want to build an app using just about <em>any</em> of the standard iOS features (like tab bars, navigation controllers, table views, etc), you gotta use Obj-C, or build it from scratch.</p>
<p>The Mono guys have a cross-platform development tool that they claim gives pretty good results&mdash;converting C# to Objective-C, including (most of? many of?) the interfaces to iOS routines.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have personal experience with it, but the Mono team seems <span class="caps">AWFULLY</span> sharp. It&rsquo;s at least imaginable to do it that way.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Mono at all. I may have heard of it before, but I never really looked into it.</p>
<p>I personally think that building &ldquo;cross-platform&rdquo; apps is bad practice because each platform has different UI conventions. For instance, I think I could count the number of good cross-platform desktop applications on one hand, and they&rsquo;re mostly web browsers.</p>
<p>My philosophy is that if you want to build a good app for more than one platform, build <em>separate</em> apps for each platform. You&rsquo;ll end up with a better user experience for <em>all</em> your users.</p>
<p>Also, it looks like Mono costs at least $400 if you want to publish your app. Otherwise you&rsquo;re limited to dicking around in the simulator.</p>
<p>You may actually be surprised at what tools exist. There are solutions being made to all things in the world and cross-platform development is one such topic. You can get some great performance from these tools on par with natively built products. It&rsquo;s all a matter of how efficiently you implement these things.</p>
<p>You have to look at it from the point of view from businesses. They don&rsquo;t have a lot of time or maybe even the manpower/resources to devote to developing native apps for all of the major platforms in their native languages. If they could find a solution that would allow them to develop their application on a universal level and penetrate each platform, then you can be damn sure they&rsquo;re going to go for that solution, even if they have to shell out a lot of money. Because in the end, they&rsquo;ll make up what they lost if their app is successful (and much more if it&rsquo;s readily available on all the major platforms).</p>
<p>I mean take a look at something like Xamarin which costs an arm and a leg, but gives you so much damn development power that you don&rsquo;t know what to do with: <a href="http://xamarin.com/" target="_blank">http://xamarin.com/</a></p>
<p>Some people might try to do this in order to keep on using the language they know, however you won&rsquo;t get around ObjC for a native iOS app.</p>
<p>Apart from this: ObjC is a fantastic language. :)</p>
<p>Even less would be interested to develop for it, since they don&rsquo;t need to. Just write for Android, man&hellip;</p>
<p>That would be fatal. Remember OS/2. A brilliant system, could run windows binaries, too&hellip;</p>
<p>The whole point of Apps is to have a perfectly bespoke experience. When you start running apps meant for some other platform you lose all the benefits and get all the drawbacks (that Google and others keep going on about) not to mention that the apps will probably like crap. This is just an easy way to inflate app numbers for bragging rights.</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10 won&rsquo;t survive without the Android runtime for sure&hellip;</p>
<p>It definitely won&rsquo;t save it, they run like shyt.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting, is that its actually possible to sideload Android APKs.</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10 won&rsquo;t survive because of the Android runtime for sure&hellip;</p>
<p>(no one will buy BB10 devices to run Android 2.x apps)</p>
<p>  What percentage of Android apps target 4.0+ only?</p>
<p>A lot more of them and the number just keeps getting larger.</p>
<p>Yes, developers really don&rsquo;t care about <strong>the overwhelming majority of Androids today</strong> that aren&rsquo;t running 4.X Android&mdash;probably will <span class="caps">NEVER</span> get upgraded for it, for whatever reasons. Those egotistical devs are all about bragging to their buddies about how cute some new feature is in their app, regardless of whether anybody buys/uses it.</p>
<p>No wonder they don&rsquo;t worry about making any money; if they wanted to, they&rsquo;d develop their apps to make use of 4.X if it was available, and fall back to an approach as good as possible if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure but I would guess less than 5%. According to Google themselves more than 60% of Android devices in the wild are still running on 2.&times;.</p>
<p>Verge often have Nexus devices in their mind which in reality only a tiny minority of people are using.</p>
<p>Most importantly, google chrome.</p>
<p>The BB10 browser is the most compliant compliant browser available</p>
<p>whoopdy-frickin&rsquo;-do&hellip;can I sync it with Chrome on my desktop</p>
<p>But performance vise, they&rsquo;re not the best. Ars technica ran tests using the Google Octane test and the Mozilla Kraken test and it lost on both.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BB10-vs-S3-charts.006.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BB10-vs-S3-charts.005.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I would rather trust Google regarding compliance and for browser performance. Their entire business relies on the web and performance and compliance is the the most important for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Ars, and that report in particular was useful.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re <span class="caps">NOT</span> comparing the BB browser to Chrome; you&rsquo;re showing (Ars&rsquo; point) that the <span class="caps">CPU</span> in the BB10 is <strong>probably</strong> neither cutting-edge nor sluggish, in the middle of the pack.</p>
<p>In fact, the Ars piece doesn&rsquo;t say much about how <span class="caps">ANY</span> app will run as the Dalvik or other VM running Android/java will slow it down versus a good native (C++ or Objective-C) version.</p>
<p>If you throw around this sort of stuff, you should understand it better.</p>
<p>Android is a lot more advanced OS and so is iOS and WP. Though, WP has not advanced as far as iOS or Android. BB10&rsquo;s concept is flawed from my view and by a lot. Android updates come like Wildfire. Blackberry won&rsquo;t be able to keep up at this right. Also, there&rsquo;s the difference in kernels which affect performance. BB10 (<span class="caps">UNIX</span>) Android (Linux)</p>
<p>It just needs to target the most used <span class="caps">API</span> in Android, not the most recent one.</p>
<p>What is flawed about the BB10 concept?</p>
<p>And most Android phone models don&rsquo;t get any updates at all.</p>
<p>Lol you clearly don&#8217;t know bb10 is <span class="caps">QNX</span> which is 100,000 lines of code and they can fix one code and update that code, android uses Linux which has 8 million lines of code and is way harder to find and fix a problem. <span class="caps">QNX</span> is the only <span class="caps">RTOS</span>. Do some research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BlackBerry 10 won&rsquo;t survive because of the Android runtime for sure&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could save commenting time with more succinct statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackberry 10 won&rsquo;t survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s the other way around, BB won&#8217;t survive if they keep relying on other platform&#8217;s apps. Android apps has enough problems of their own, security issues, bad/no quality assurance, malwares, etc. Let alone running them on a non-native runtime. For a quick start it&#8217;s okay, but in the long term it&#8217;s not a good idea at all.</p>
<p>yeah that stuff is just killing Android</p>
<p>wait..what? one-point-how-many-million activations per day?</p>
<p>Blackberry need to grow a pair and go native apps only.</p>
<p>This stuff is bad for developers, bad for customers and bad for Blackberry.</p>
<p>1. If I was an Android developer, I wouldnt be happy with the experience of my app on the Z10.<br />
2. It&rsquo;s confusing and offers bad experiences to customers. They won&rsquo;t love the device and won&rsquo;t buy Blackberry next time.</p>
<p>If you were an Android developer and were not happen with the experience of your app on the Z10, then wouldn&rsquo;t you develop that native app for BB10?</p>
<p>Probably not even worth considering at this point in time.</p>
<p>If you were an Android developer, you would at least make an attempt to try the experience on a Z10 before concluding you wouldn&rsquo;t be happy with it</p>
<p>So survival is dependent on the Android runtime? At which point does this dream end?</p>
<p>Apps are the stupidest thing everyone is so focused on. All a OS maker needs to do is make a great business phone that gets the net, email, camera, a baked In paint like program, an Office like program, plenty of storage, and some other things I know I&rsquo;m forgetting, but doodle ninja fucks can play games on a console. This app bullshit is for the birds now. People keep doing shit to death, apps are meaningless now, I need to tweet, I need to facebook, a society of yappers not doers.</p>
<p>So&hellip; third party software is meaningless.  That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying?  Just wondering do you actually own any computing device?</p>
<p>Blackberry has proven itself over the years as a reliable, secure phone OS for corporate and government uses. The new BB10 design, features and more secure OS will be an excellent fit for their niche market while Apple, Android and Windows stay in the consumer grade market. As more hacks and jail breaks come out for Apple, Android and Windows, the business user will choose Blackberry as a more reliable choice. The fact they will support Android 4.1 Jelly Bean apps and runtime will make Blackberry even more interesting for users looking for more secure alternatives.</p>
<p>Dude you look dodgey as fuck posting that. Signed up today with 2 blackberry comments lol</p>
<p>Eventually, huh? Pathetic. With the way they ran in demos, they need to give that dream up and promote better native apps! They&rsquo;re just asking to fail, smh.</p>
<p>Blackberry will officially support Android 4.1 right after Google releases Android 7.2.</p>
<p>Lol bb10 devices will support android 4.2 games before 70% of android devices.</p>
<p>Yeah they won&rsquo;t be able to keep up with the current Android version, heck even Android manufacturers can&rsquo;t keep up with the current Android version.<br />
The should stop promoting this option and encourage developers to go full native.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for Project Stutter when a Z10 runs Android 4.1.</p>
<p>Just stop it Blackberry.  Kill off the Android runtime already!  It is doing nothing but hurting their image because of the inconsistency of Android apps that aren&rsquo;t build for the BB 10 platform.</p>
<p>Just build the Blackberry that we want. I don&rsquo;t want a mini Xbox that can make calls.</p>
<p>1000 Native Apps&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Only 40% of there apps are android ports the rest are all native. And they have 90% of the top 1000% apps on iOS/android.</p>
<p>This is crap for devs</p>
<p>Who cares which version Google is up to, developers are going to use earlier version of the <span class="caps">API</span> for compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>Blackberry maybe stand to benefit from newer Android APIs earlier than most current gen android phones out there.</p>
<p>Just put stock Android 4.1 on it.</p>
<p>and join the legion of OEMs playing second-fiddle to Samsung?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather push my own thing honestly. Or join a niche like WinPho or webOS eventually</p>
<p>WinPho is no niche. It&rsquo;s a small pie with loads of OEMs trying to take a chunk of it. WebOS is not worth it. At most I would go with Tizen or Jolla OS, which are based on open-source software and could be easily deployed.</p>
<p>But I said webOS eventually, not right now. I still consider WinPho a niche. Microsoft don&rsquo;t have the <span class="caps">XBOX</span> Music + Video user numbers to challenge iTunes. They don&rsquo;t have the SkyDrive usage numbers to challenge DropBox, the WinPho platform has just enough numbers to challenge BlackBerry. Its still a niche I think &ndash; but I like it and I&rsquo;m committing to it</p>
<p>Slightly, bb still the 3rd top OS and has about 40+ million more users then then</p>
<p>Android 4.1 is still to this day buggy, promote native apps please BlackBerry, even at the expense of overall app numbers in BlackBerry world.</p>
<p>No. It&rsquo;s not. You probably meant 4.2</p>
<p>People fail to realize androids apps run in a davlik have type vm which can make apps lag etc, bb10 doesn&#8217;t use that it use a runtime, android vm they created and they check and scan every app before it goes on blackberry world</p>
<p>BB been playing catch up for years , they&rsquo;re pros at this .</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s running Android apps in some virtualization mode with 1/10 of the speed? Why not just put a real Android there and scrap that BB OS if it has nothing else benefits than providing a custom skin to Android apps.</p>
<p>Blackberry has it in reverse. Instead of coding your own OS then trying to duct-tape on compatability with Android, they should be using the Android OS, putting on a blackberry skin and giving only Blackberry certified Android phones access to the <span class="caps">BBM</span> and other awesome enterprise features of Blackberry. Now you have the security and business tools of a blackberry with the app selection/marketplace of Android.</p>
<p>The problem is using Android requires them to open source certain stuff under its Apache license. Blackberry&rsquo;s trump card is their proprietary network, <span class="caps">BBM</span> and security, all which could be compromised by using an open-source OS.</p>
<p>If their security can be compromised by an open source OS then it isn&rsquo;t really security, it&rsquo;s more like obscuring your data.</p>
<p>All of that stopped be a trump card when they lost critical mass in market share. What good is <span class="caps">BBM</span> if none of my friends or work assosciates are on BB? What good is the security if my company has gone to a <span class="caps">BYOD</span> model?</p>
<p>They need to turn all of those into cross-platform services and scrap their hardware division altogether or sell it (and there are already rumors floating in that regard &ndash; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3899052/rim-may-sell-hardware-division-after-blackberry-10-launch">http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3899052/rim-may-sell-hardware-division-after-blackberry-10-launch</a>)</p>
<p>There is no point in security and <span class="caps">BBM</span> if the underlying system isn&rsquo;t considered the most secure and already has a reputation for being prone to malware, as is the case with Android.</p>
<p>As in the case with Apple iPhone as well. How many times do people install apps from the iTunes app store only to realize later that they get notified every second or have popup ads and other annoying sneak up on them.</p>
<p>I think Blackberry has a great chance at carving its own niche again. More BB models should follow but I think they are making headway.</p>
<p>Blackberry, just build out your own app store with your own apps. Make them solid and stable and you will be better off. The emulated Android apps on BB10 are awful. Blackberry should have focused on bringing a few thousand quality apps to market than trying for a boastful 70,000 crappy apps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad that they are committed to having support for a version of Android that has already been surpassed. Maybe they can have it out by the time 5.1 comes out&hellip;</p>
<p>Targeting the 4.1 Jelly Bean <span class="caps">API</span> is a good idea. The difference for 4.2 are marginal at best (hence why they kept the JB moniker). Lets hope that with this more quality apps make the jump to BB10.<br />
And The Verge could start adopting a less snarky tone torwards new OSes.</p>
<p>When it comes to Blackberry comments and reports, there&rsquo;s always an air or snarkiness and sarcasm.</p>
<p>Almost all articles have a sarcastic headline or tone &ndash; &lsquo;&hellip;eventually&rsquo; &ndash; whereas if something were eventually planned for iOS or Android but not here today, the headline would simply state that something is coming and leave it at that.</p>
<p>Because Blackberry doesn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;everything&rsquo;, now and better, it is somehow inferior and dead in the water whereas both iOS and Android both have their shortcomings but because they are market leaders it&rsquo;s OK or at least acceptable.</p>
<p>The Blackberry vs. Samsung Superbowl ad is also telling. While the Samsung ad was marginally more entertaining and glib, it was just as pointless as Blackberry&rsquo;s ad. Somehow, Samsung got a pass on that.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s simply become fashionable to make fun of Blackberry and tech journalists simply play to that instead of just reporting but hey, who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy a little schedenfreude from time to time.</p>
<p>Its disappointing coming from Dan because he is like a freaking enciclopedia of mobile.  I guess he has to follow the bosses opinion.  Joshua is just kooo kooo, and Nilay is Joshuas mini me and just repeats everything Joshua says.  Dieter has been a lot more fair but slient lately.  The skinny guy from England seems medicated or high, and is incoherent most of the time.  So lets wait for Dieter and see.  This phones are very good.</p>
<p>Agreed, sometimes I wonder if what The Verge is trying to do is not report news and interesting piece of the tech world but to become the &ldquo;fashionistas&rdquo; of the tech world.</p>
<p>Blackberry presented an extremely solid product. They just need to keep the momentum. Continuously polish the OS while releasing new hardware regularly (every six months).</p>
<p>They pretty much have already become that over the past few months.</p>
<p>The thing is that it would be really hard to take something that BB says they&rsquo;re going to do and assume anything but a long time horizon and avoid a little snarkiness. Look at all of the delays surrounding BB10. It would also be hard not to take the tone when this just seems like such a hack. So much better for them to focus on native apps than to spend any effort updating a virtualized OS that&rsquo;s going to offer a sub-par experience.</p>

<p>But Blackberry has earned the scorn by being so, so, so slow to come around to the realities of the market. While I certainly agree that iOS and Android have shortcomings, they are so much more mature in working through those problems than BB because <span class="caps">RIM</span> had its head in the sand for so long.</p>
<p>Blackberry has earned every ounce of skepticism it gets from the tech blogs, and if they want a chance and respect they&rsquo;re going to have to earn that as well.</p>
<p>What a load of hooey. Android 2.x wasn&rsquo;t that great either. I know, I have an Android 2.x phone and it&rsquo;s only OK and I don&rsquo;t recall much scorn regarding that OS. I also recall looking at an Android 1.x device way back and it simply sucked! It took how many years for Android to mature? Three, four?  Where was the scorn and skepticism?</p>
<p>With regards to Blackberry&rsquo;s head in the sand, they bought <span class="caps">QNX</span> back in 2010 so they certainly recognized that they needed to change their OS awhile ago but it takes a lot of time to change a company of that size, especially when you have a massive locomotive which looks like $20 billion + in revenue from the school pushing you in a different direction.</p>
<p>Blackberry certainly has made mistakes and a few big ones but honestly, who doesn&rsquo;t and considering that their significant successes I think they&rsquo;ve earned some balance.</p>
<p>But let me guess, you&rsquo;ve never failed, right? Do you deserve disrespect for your failures?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the point &ndash; if  BB10 had been released in an environment where it was competing against Android 2.x or iOS 1 or 2, it wouldn&rsquo;t deserve the same level of skepticism and doubt. It wasn&rsquo;t though &ndash; <span class="caps">RIM</span> made more than mistakes &ndash; it made a monumental miscalculation that their OS had such a loyal following that wanted what they were making that they just needed to keep on the same course.</p>
<p>They acquired <span class="caps">QNX</span> in 2010? It&rsquo;s 2013! The iPhone was introduced in 2007 . . . BB10 is 6 years late to market. There&rsquo;s no way BB can expect anything but skepticism about their efforts and words like &ldquo;. . . Eventually&rdquo; in Verge posts.</p>
<p>Sorry if that seems <em>mean</em>, but once BB proves they have an OS that is worthy of unskeptical praise and if they start delivering products in a timely manner, maybe the market and tech journalists will forgive them.</p>
<p>Everybody&hellip;try the phones, tech bloggers love pressing the home button!  Lol!  here are a few pictures for everybody to enjoy.  You wont see this ever posted here because&hellip;.I really dont know, they just hate Canada I guess! lol <br /><a href="http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u1813297/P1010016.jpg" target="_blank">http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u1813297/P1010016.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u10880/White_Q10.jpg" target="_blank">http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u10880/White_Q10.jpg</a></p>
<p>so much negative comments,</p>
<p>whats not to hate for one platform to support a runtime for another, its not like they spend money more wisely elsewhere on celebs, might aswell go towards enriching their platform.</p>
<p>people complain about app numbers, now they complain app quality, tbh they went the right route in getting the numbers first then quality second, theres no way to improve the app if its not even on the phone in the first place, at the same time even high quality apps on other platforms still keep on improving through iterative updates anyway.</p>
<p>Bingo. Blackberry did everything right in the way it launched the platform.<br />
The only thing I can criticize them on is that they should&rsquo;ve been faster and have released still in 2012 (preferably by Black Friday). <br />
Since they weren&rsquo;t able to meet that time frame at least they launched a polished OS whose only serious criticism is a lack of a native high-quality maps app (And before Google Maps even Apple didn&rsquo;t have this) and the quality of some of the apps in the store.</p>
<p>It will still suck! Bought a Lumia for my second phone &amp; its fantastic. iPhone &amp; WP to dominate rest are all junks</p>
<p>I believe this whole Android app support is garbage and will do Blackberry and BB10 more harm than good.</p>
<p>People are going to get this device and will start looking for apps. Naturally they won&rsquo;t find most of their favourite or interesting apps they read about as native ones. So they download the Android ports, without even knowing or understand that those are Android ports.</p>
<p>Suddenly people will realise how horribly they perform (and they really do perform catastrophically, I won&rsquo;t even argue about that), how they don&rsquo;t support certain phone and OS functions and how they don&rsquo;t fit into the systems theme.</p>
<p>And guess what is going to happen? People will blame Blackberry and will say BB10 is garbage because it can&rsquo;t even run their favourite apps smoothly, while the iPhone or their recent Samsung could.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the impression average Joe will get.</p>
<p>Will they be able to port TouchWiz to BB 10? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m waiting for&#8230;</p>
<p>I think the Android runtime is smart, but Blackberry is handling it wrong.</p>
<p>Android apps should be sideload-only. You shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to submit Android apps to the BB10 store.</p>
<p>That way, as a user, if there&rsquo;s one Android-only app that I <span class="caps">REALLY</span> need, I can install it. But when I&rsquo;m casually browsing the app store to see what&rsquo;s available, I&rsquo;ll only be shown native apps, which will provide a good user experience.</p>
<p>As a developer, I&rsquo;ll have incentive to create native BB10 apps, because I&rsquo;ll know that&rsquo;s the only way to get into the app store.</p>
<p>Everyone wins.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t work in the real world because developers have to make money. Sideloading apps wouldn&rsquo;t allow developers to sell their Android apps to BB10 owners. So they would not make them available at all for BB10 owners. Allowing developers to sell their Android apps on BB World was the only possible way for BB to get Android devs on board.</p>
<p>This is so exciting! Who is going to be able to run Android 4.1 apps first? BB 10 users or the majority of Android users?</p>
<p>&hellip; which begs the question why not just use Android?</p>
<p>Honestly, at this point they probably had less to lose if the just did run it.</p>
<p>The goal of BB10 is not to be another Android. They want developers to target BB10 and they got some big names already.</p>
<p>Supporting Android apps fills the gap which would users prevent to get BB10 because of some specific apps not available in the near future like local apps. With Android support there is always at least one option you can fallback to. It is a smart move. And unlike what the Verge claimed a lot of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Android apps just run under BB10 normally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which they have tested though since they have not mentioned it at all.</p>
<p>I think this is actually a smart move lets be honest there is no way bb10 or wp8 will be able to get 700000 apps in 2 or even 5 years, now if bb10 gets all the major apps which they seem capable of ( they got a lot of them already ) the only thing stoping people from converting from android ( which has the largest user base ) are few apps that the user care about and use regularly which he will be able to still use. So it&rsquo;s a win win situation <span class="caps">IMO</span>.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>Why do people keep stating that they should promote their native apps when they already do this during their developer conferences, their social networks, their Build for BlackBerry program where they give developers incentives to go native offering them a guaranteed $10K plus prime real estate in the app stores featured section.</p>
<p>Is it because the Verge didnt broadcast that part of the conference and they are unable to think for themselves and do their own legwork?</p>
<p>why ? just use android  then</p>
<p>Would you review this again, or update your review now it has JB?</p>
<p>Why? Samsung shouldn&#8217;t get points for releasing a tampered-with version of software that should&#8217;ve been available a while ago.</p>
<p>I wonder if they are doing this because of the Nexus 10 which will be available very soon.</p>
<p>Err 300mb OTA??!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good that it&#8217;s finally arriving, but every time I see a new post about a manufacturer updating a device, I remember how funny (and sad) it is that my old Nexus S is running more up-to-date software than the majority of the current flagships.</p>
<p>I think verge should update the review,  the jelly bean update seems to came with all the galaxy note 2 improvements , and specially should solve the performance issue verge complained last time.<br />
I already know like 5 people in my office that has this tablet and they seem to love it, I want to buy one for Christmas</p>
<p>When the update arrives, please update the review, especially the part about multitasking. It&#8217;s weird that it works perfectly on the Note II but not on the Note 10.1. The main difference is Jellybean.</p>
<p>I hope this means a nice JB build for the OG GT10.1.</p>
<p>The original Galaxy Tab 10.1 wont be getting jelly bean, right? I&#8217;m think of rooting mine.</p>
<p>Nexus S!</p>
<p>YESSSSSS. My poor old Nexus lives a while longer.</p>
<p>Yes, and I hope Sprint doesn&#8217;t ruin this for me by sacking the NS4g again like it had before.</p>
<p>Nah, the GSM Nexus S only got ICS a week before the NS4G. I don&#8217;t think Sprint will be an issue.</p>
<p>Ignore Sprint&#8217;s (and the other carriers) stupid delays and flash CyanogenMod 9. I&#8217;ve been running it on my NS4G since it was first buildable, back in december, and it&#8217;s been great! Just released RC1, so final release of 9.0.0 should be RSN, but even the RC is already nice and stable (I built for myself the night before RC1 and it&#8217;s great).</p>
<p>(It may be even worse than delays though&#8230; The Nexus S 4G (d720/crespo4g) has been put into archive mode, &#8220;for reference only&#8221;, on the Google devices factory images page, so it getting official JB is slightly questionable),</p>
<p>Really great news for Nexus S owners. It took Google like 4 months to push the ICS OTA.</p>
<p>Provided it won&#8217;t be like the ICS rollout&#8230; My sis&#8217; Nexus S literally just got that update not long ago and she&#8217;s still trying to get used to ICS over GB.</p>
<p>Embrace for support calls&#8230;</p>
<p>I have to admit, the roll out was never really a problem considering most Nexus owners know how to side load.</p>
<p>Aww yeah. This reminds me why I decided to go with the NS. Geek cred preserved without having to shell out for new hardware.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start spamming the &#8220;Check Now&#8221; button on my GNex starting July 1st.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ll spam it nevertheless, just for the lulz.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming the Verizon Galaxy Nexus will <em>not</em> get this in July?</p>
<p>U <strong>jelly</strong>?</p>
<p>I <em>like</em> what you did there.</p>
<p>I doubt it will. I just paid 290 bucks to leave Verizon because of that and will never be going back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought about it, but it would cost me the ETF+$350 for the unlocked Nexus &#8211; whatever I get from selling my phone&#8230; And I don&#8217;t know if I want to do that&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m impressed at the Nexus S update.  Hey Lumia, eat that news.</p>
<p>The lumia is getting WP7.8 though, why do people keep saying it&#8217;s not getting updated.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s like Samsung only giving my Galaxy S a value pack; had some ICS features but it was just a gimmick. Same story with the Lumia range.</p>
<p>Beccause it&#8217;s not getting updated to the version that matters.</p>
<p>I wonder about the Galaxy Nexus and Moto Xoom on Verizon, and the Nexus S on Sprint&#8230; I&#8217;m guessing those are not getting update.  The Moto Xoom on Verizon JUST got ICS like 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Why would they not get the update at all?  That makes no sense.  It may take longer to reach Verizon devices due to the CDMA issues, but there&#8217;s no reason to suspect they won&#8217;t get them at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the moto xoom on vzn will get the update &#8211; but it will take a while. I&#8217;m just disappointed because I cancelled vzn service on my xoom 15 months ago and it will still take me a while to get the update.</p>
<p>Good to hear. May have to go back to stock while the cooks get the custom ROMs up and running.</p>
<p>And my Swedish,  ublocked and undrande Galaxy Nexus still hasn&#8217;t recieved 4.04. 4.1 delivery towards 2013 I guess.</p>
<p>Thats good and all but my GN still hasent received 4.0.4.</p>
<p>The charts showing the market penetration of JB, ICS, and Gingerbread at the end of 2012 vs iOS 6 are going to be hilarious for sure. The majority of the Android user base will now be <em>two</em> major versions behind, APIs and everything.</p>
<p>You know what&#8217;s even more humorous? The number speed at which Android is leaving iOS behind. Soon enough, that fragmentation will have more users in each &#8220;fragment&#8221; than iOS will have in total.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what&#8217;s really funny.</p>
<p>Personally I would rather be on a stable and non fragmented ecosystem, it matters not to me how many other people are using it, as long as it&#8217;s enough to get support. Both of which iOS is.</p>
<p>This si why I never understand the marketshare argument. It is a classic example of quantity over quality.</p>
<p><em>Note: When i say quality, I refer the the Android ecosystem, support, updates etc&#8230; not the OS itself, which is great</em></p>
<p>If Motorola is smart, they will wait to release the RAZR HD with jelly bean. Moto  is the only manufacturer that hasn&#8217;t shipped out an ICS device, they could get a jump on everyone releasing the first new phone with JB.</p>
<p>But remember, the verizon xoom update will be postponed indefinetly until eventually scrapped, and the Verizon gnex will get it around November.</p>
<p>When is the hot-new GS3 getting it?</p>
<p>Samsung?</p>
<p>Sprint?</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p>Considering my Bell Galaxy Nexus is still on 4.0.1 I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it.</p>
<p>Flash yakju. Seriously. I flashed Yakju 4.0.2 when it came out and got the 4.0.4 update over the air at the same time as other yakju Galaxy Nexuses.</p>
<p>The fault lies with Canadian carriers and Samsung Canada who don&#8217;t give a crap about updates.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t think they will push Jelly Bean any time in July either.</p>
<p>My sprint GSII has yet to get ICS. I&#8217;ll never see this built until I buy another phone. LAAAAME</p>
<p>Seeing as I&#8217;m probably the only Xoom owner on the verge (at least it feels like it). FUCK YEA JELLY ON MY XOOM!!!!</p>
<p>As mediocre as the Xoom apparently was, it&#8217;s pretty impressive that it&#8217;s still getting timely updates!</p>
<p>My phone&#8217;s build number is IMM76I (Takju), is it possible for me to flash the 4.1 ROM linked in the OP? Is there more than one variant of takju? God, I am confused. I thought once I flashed Takju on my GSM European SGN I would be able to receive updates to Android as soon as they came out&#8230;</p>
<p>I have installed Jelly Bean on my phone. It&#8217;s freaking awesome. Google Now understands my British accent flawlessly whereas Siri really struggles with it.</p>
<p>NexuS \o/</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to put my money on Spring of 2037 for the release of 4.1 to the Verizon GN. That fits their update &#8220;schedule&#8221; history about right.</p>
<p>Hopefully that includes ALL Nexus S&#8217;s. I never got the OTA 4.0 update.</p>
<p>OMG the glue.</p>
<p>Take that, horses.</p>
<p>Oh so that&#8217;s what happened to them. Serves them right.</p>
<p>Thanks to Kimber Stream for the Yeats assist!</p>
<p>Every time I see &#8220;Kimber Stream&#8221; I&#8217;m like &#8220;What&#8217;s the bandwidth?&#8221;</p>
<p>And thanks to Ross Mille for spelling my name totally right. &lt;3</p>
<p>Whatever. I&#8217;m being efficient. The &#8216;s&#8217; is totally unnecessary. Please fix your name kthx.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get right on that, Ro Mille</p>
<p>Thanks Kimbeam!</p>
<p>Ross has spoken. You will now forever be known by The Verge community as Kimbeam.</p>
<p>lolol ^This</p>
<p>KimBeam 4 life</p>
<p>It&#8217;s girly &#8220;sun beam&#8221; yet some also might take it as an allusion to Jim Beam and that you&#8217;re giving Nilay a run for the boozer crown.</p>
<p>Overall a top notch nickname</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stop looking at the glue.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glued to the screen for 90so.tv And sneaky horse still present, clever.</p>
<p>4k and 8k TV makes no sense. VFX shots in a movie are a max of 2k. Even if you scanned all the film in the movie again at 4k, those VFX shots would still be 2k shots that are upscaled. Some films shot on early digital cameras have a resolution cap built in. Many VFX shots in films aren&#8217;t even obvious VFX shots, some rig-removal paint, etc.</p>
<p>People know they&#8217;ll just be paying for upscaling, right?</p>
<p>Well that was true for every other resolution change, &#8220;there is no content on 1080p&#8221; was a common complaint, but content creators adapted fast.</p>
<p>You can just say 1080. Saying &#8220;progressive&#8221; in context of source material is redundant. Scanning mode is just relevant in viewing.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re so right, but it just feels wrong to use numbers without some indicator of what they&#8217;re for.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no content in 1080 [elephants]&#8221;<br />
&#8220;There is no content in 1080 [of Americas TV channels]&#8221;<br />
&#8220;There is no content in 1080 [degree flips by the world&#8217;s most amazing skateboarders]&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;HD 1080&#8217;, &#8216;1080 resolution&#8217; and so on all sound awkward, so the &#8216;p&#8217; serves as a quasi-unit, soothing my mind.</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not the same thing. With every other resolution change for consumer television, you could always go back to the higher resolution media and remaster. 1080 is less than 2k. 4k and 8k are greater than 2k theatrical work so you don&#8217;t have the luxury of pulling from higher resolution sources.</p>
<p>Peek-a-boo at the end, love it.</p>
<p>There it is! Haha, for a moment I was disappointed at no show horse. Sneaky sneaky!</p>
<p>I thought the glue was to signify that the horse&#8230; was no more. And yet, there he is.</p>
<p>The horse had some glue too!</p>
<p>Could have said legs. Thighs are just&#8230; too specific.</p>
<p>wrong post, awesome comment system</p>

<p>&#8230;.why do you need to see his thighs?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not his entirety if he&#8217;s only partially there&#8230;</p>
<p>I thought surely we were going to start another thread about the cuteness that is David, although talking about his thighs would certainly be over the top.</p>
<p>That intro about being presented in your entirety was referencing this, right? <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/19/3527144/1-2-or-3-4-of-david-pierce-watching-surface-being-dropped" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/19/3527144/1-2-or-3-4-of-david-pierce-watching-surface-being-dropped</a></p>

<p>Am I the only one wondering what&#8217;s going on with the Macs in the background. Yesterday&#8217;s Mac Pros seem to be replaced by iMacs with glue next to them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Apple buying off the staff for more anti-whatever&#8217;s being released this week propaganda.</p>
<p>Little known fact, the rough beast that Yeats was referring to, was, in fact the Horseface Killah.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain to me what the glue means?</p>
<p>I, too, would like to know this.</p>
<p>you can make glue from Horses, not done very often anymore but still a threat used by trainers if horses don&#8217;t do well in races.</p>

<p>Way to go Sprint! Can&#8217;t wait to get this on my phone.</p>
<p>I was gonna say, damn Sprint! Way to be the first!</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t 4.2 already out? I&#8217;ll never understand how Android folks tolerate this kind of carrier intervention.</p>
<p>Finally, I can not feel like a complete idiot for going with Sprint and receiving abysmal coverage. At least I can stream video to a TV I don&#8217;t own.</p>
<p>Where are you, AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>At least you&#8217;re not on VZW, we probably won&#8217;t see this until 2013.</p>

<p>same here&#8230;&#8230;still waiting for JB on verizon&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the first thing I did when I read about it. I was dissapointed though-it&#8217;s not available yet!</p>
<p>refresh&#8230; nope not yet&#8230; 2 minutes&#8230; refresh&#8230; not yet</p>
<p>I believe its a staggered update. Not everyone will receive JB at the aame time</p>
<p>3-4 month upgrade cycle, hopefully samsung can keep this up.</p>
<p>I wish Sprint had better coverage. They&#8217;re much less sucky than VZW.  I have a GNex so it doesn&#8217;t bother me too much but if they can set an example for other carriers good for them. They are definitely earning great PR points in my book right now.</p>
<p>Agreed. A better company in every way except the coverage, which is what counts. I just moved cities and finally had to switch to VZW after pulling down WELL under 1 Mbps consistently with Sprint. I heart my LTE, but jesus Verizon makes me want to murder people.</p>
<p>Laugh. The community is and has been on 4.1.2. The carriers are garbage. Specifically this one.</p>
<p>Oh shut up&#8230;the &#8220;community&#8221; aren&#8217;t the ones buying millions of devices&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKie-vgUGdI">The community&#8217;s motto</a></p>
<p>As much as I like experimenting with new ROMs, I&#8217;ve decided I can&#8217;t handle the instability anymore.  Just stock for me, I am sick and tired of random bugs crashing my phone.</p>
<p>Is it a record for any US-based Android phone? Obviously I am discounting the Nexus phones.</p>
<p>Sprint was also incredibly fast in delivering froyo to the original evo.</p>
<p>Cm10 on the U.S. variants of the gs3 has been nothing short of amazing and epic.  Free yourselves friends.</p>
<p>Amen to that</p>
<p>No matter how much people think this should have been earlier, HTC is still on ICS&#8230;<br />
So, in terms of software support:<br />
Nexus line&gt;Samsung&gt;HTC<br />
I&#8217;m disappointed in you, HTC.</p>
<p>Tmobile just gave me 4.0.4, so I can&#8217;t imagine this phone will be seeing JB soon</p>
<p>Nice! Been a good month for me and Sprint. First I&#8217;m finally rocking LTE here in Chi-town, now I&#8217;ll be rocking Jellybean.</p>
<p>Very cool!</p>
<p>Nice job Sprint.</p>
<p>Now time to up your game, AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>3-4 months later? I would have sold my phone by now.</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Just in time for Android 4.2!</p>
<p>Come on, AT&amp;T&#8230;.get off ya bum and give us our jelly beans!!</p>
<p>One V, too. PLEASE.</p>
<p>HTC One V will most likely get the update.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll live in hope!</p>
<p>Doubt it.</p>
<p>This is their low tier device that most people don&#8217;t know about. They will probably say that after countless tests that the hardware isnt powerful enough to run it.</p>
<p>Will this be true? No. The dev community will have JB ready for the V in no time.</p>
<p>But such is life&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why they wouldn&#8217;t. The One V is part of their one series flagship phones. Just because it doesn&#8217;t have quad cores and 5 inch screen doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t get updated.</p>
<p>Because these companies always prioritize the majority. Sony is the only Android manufacturer that updates everything, in a non-discriminatory order. The Xperia Mini got it&#8217;s ICS update before their flagship Xperia S.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t make sense that they wouldn&#8217;t say it in this statement though.</p>
<p>I would have thought so, until this update where they didn&#8217;t mention it..</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not counting my eggs yet.  Love my One X but I don&#8217;t trust ATT not to force tether block and ten extra layers of bootloader lockdown (and cause several months delay).</p>
<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4v3myxAEU1rty10do2_500.gif" /></p>
<p>EVO 4G LTE, please.</p>
<p>No reason the One X would get it and this not&#8230;same phone basically.</p>
<p>&#8230;the only difference being support for the extSD card, any minor Sprint bloat and the different radio drivers.  Otherwise, same phone software wise. so some extra steps are needed. And since this is ONE phone on one carrier is a little alarming given the history with the likes of Nexus S 4G. hopefully HTC/Sprint makes ALL its customers happy.</p>
<p>The One X is sold on dozens of carriers worldwide, and has probably sold a few million, it is also non-carrier branded.</p>
<p>That is a huge difference when it comes to updates.</p>
<p>Droid Incredible and Evo 4G LTE suddenly come to mind. To truly claim that it&#8217;s non branded it needs to either be an S3 or an iPhone.</p>
<p>The One X is not branded apart from a boot animation (depends on network).</p>
<p>EVO 4G LTE also has a S4, One X has a Tegra 3.</p>
<p>In other words, a completely different SoC.  Huge difference.</p>
<p>The article also says the One XL is getting JB, which is an S4 device.</p>
<p>One X =! One XL.</p>
<p>The Evo 4G LTE is Sprints Flagship Android phone and supposedly Sprint and HTC have a pretty good business relationaship so I would think the Evo would get it along with the 1X/1S.</p>
<p>Their almost the same phone except the Evo is bit more tricked out.</p>
<p>If I dont get it, I will still love my phone&#8230; still a better screen that the S3 :D, I would just hate that feeling of having the best hardware on dated software&#8230;</p>
<p>It just always makes me nervous when HTC makes announcements for their One series and doesn&#8217;t mention the Evo.</p>
<p>The RUU for the EVO was pretty different than the RUU from the 1X according to the XDA forums.</p>
<p>This should go without saying. How are we as consumers letting smartphone manufacturers get away with practices like this. Imagine if a PC maker said,</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a new machine we&#8217;re making but you can&#8217;t install what you want on it without jumping through hoops that could either void your warranty, brick the machine or both. Oh and by the way we&#8217;ll be putting our skin on top of the underlying OS which will make performance take a hit and you can&#8217;t remove it, and including a bunch of apps you can&#8217;t remove. Official updates to the OS from its developers? We may or may not support them but if we do, you won&#8217;t get them until well after they&#8217;ve been released. Enjoy your device!&#8221;</p>
<p>There would be outrage and upheaval towards said company and that PC would tank. When it comes to smartphones though, everyone just takes it as fact and reports news like this with a smile. I have tried getting in contact with +HTC but never had any luck but will keep on trying. Sites like The Verge that have more clout should be pressing these issues and talking to the manufacturers about it instead of just complaining about fragmentation on their podcasts.</p>
<p>Dammit, I meant to post this as a reply to main story, for some reason it got put here.  I wish there were a delete button so I could re-add it to the bottom of the comments :-\</p>
<p>Agreed. I would also like to know why phones that we are expected to have for a minimum of 2 years (by way of contracts) STILL only come with a 1 year warranty. The consumers need to demand more.</p>
<p>Yeah, fingers crossed for the Evo 4G LTE!</p>
<p>YES</p>
<p>One would bloody well hope so.</p>
<p>I see what you did there&#8230;</p>
<p>Haha.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s absurd the updating system is so broken that this is news</p>
<p>Yeah I don&#8217;t know why people continue to fall for this updating nightmare. I have been using Android phones since 2008 and every single one had the newest version.</p>
<p>Even if the &#8220;updating system&#8221; were broken, its not news. Did people really think HTC weren&#8217;t going to update their two flagship phones?</p>
<p>But it shouldn&#8217;t be like this at all. It should be &#8216;4.1 rolling out to phones over the next month&#8217;. Not &#8217;One S gets it. Flyer Doesnt. Galaxy S3 gets it. Galaxy S doesnt. etc. etc</p>
<p>not the One V?</p>
<p>probably on a much later date than the other two phones. They need probably much more magic to get sense+jelly bean working on the much weaker hardware. IMHO i am positive that they will bring JB to One V</p>
<p>Your really believe that? That&#8217;s just marketing BS. It has no technical reasons.</p>
<p>Once I removed sense from my One X, it doubled the battery life. Sense has nothing to love. Oh, maybe the camera app. The rest is pure junk .</p>
<p>Yeah Sense sure is a piece of sophisticated engineering and needs couple months to adopt to new update, lol. They&#8217;re just trying to find an excuse to push a brand new set of devices instead.</p>
<p>Sense is not bad bloated as it was in the past. Go. Troll else where</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still bloated at it&#8217;s very core though, hence why Sense apps can&#8217;t run on other ROMs.</p>
<p>When Android didn&#8217;t look as good as it does now, Sense was a good idea. But now it makes the phone look worse, slows it down and has a strange clash of themes in some places. The best thing about 4.0 is the camera.</p>
<p>It is, according to the words of many developers inside the dedicated XDA subforums. There are still many remnants of older Sense version in there, responsible for at least a huge chunk of storage size, and there seem to be background services running with no apparent meaning for Sense 4.0 devices at all. Furthermore, Sense is still so heavy that mainly multitasking is a pain in the ass. It&#8217;s the same crappy reset-style multitasking as on (older versions of) iOS. That, and there are enough apps and <strong>all</strong> Sense widgets that are inside the core of Sense and cannot be found in non-Sense roms, or even launchers on Sense-based roms including stock.</p>
<p>And explain me this: How was he trolling? He just stated what he believed to be the reason and used the appropriate words. &#8220;probably&#8221; and &#8220;IMHO&#8221; to start with. There is nothing trolling about that, unless you have a very different defintion of the true meaning of the word.</p>
<p>Listen, if you don&#8217;t like Sense for whatever the reason. Buy a Nexus or root your phone and quit bitching about it&#8230;&#8230;Geez!</p>
<p>Bloated or not bloated Sense is the best of all the skins out there IMO. 4.0 is the less bloated of all previous versions of Sense, so HTC is making progress. Would love to see HTC put Vanilla Android on the 1X/1S or Evo 4G LTE but it ain&#8217;t gonna happen.</p>
<p>I never &#8220;bitched&#8221; about it. I said merely what is my experience and knowledge on the matter. There are other reasons to purchase a phone than software. I bought the device due to the design and build quality &#8211; which had only a minor flaw or two, as opposed to competing devices which I believe to have more flaws at this time.</p>
<p>I agree with your second statement above, it indeed is the least bloated version of Sense, although free speech and the likes do give anyone the right to complain &#8211; as there is plenty of reason to. HTC still isn&#8217;t where it should be. Vanilla Android on a phone alike to the One series is possible &#8211; if they&#8217;re the ones to build the next Nexus. It&#8217;s only something to hope for.</p>
<p>When the sense home screen has to reload itself under a minimal multitasking load, that tells me something is a bit bloated. Sense was fine for GB, but ICS is better without it.</p>
<p>Oh I forgot about that! Sometimes my loading could take almost 10 seconds!</p>
<p>Same here. I was rather frustrated it when it did it twice the day after I bought it :-\</p>
<p>Oh it totally isn&#8217;t as bad as it once was, but it still adds quite a bit of bloat. I had a One X for about a month before I bricked it to oblivion (long, long story) and I experienced quite a bit of annoying lag.  Apps loaded quick, pages loaded quickly, but swiping through the home screens would always stutter. Though not a huge deal, it frustrated me because I knew the phone had some fantastic hardware.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting my SIII from Amazon later today :) Wish me luck with Touchwiz&#8230;</p>
<p>Awesome! I get Jelly Bean on my One X &#8220;soon&#8221;&#8482;.</p>
<p>On a side note, do you think they are going to get sued by Blizzard and valve now?</p>
<p>what for?</p>
<p>When I think of companies that say something is coming but don&#8217;t give a date,  &#8220;soon&#8221;&#8482;, Blizzard and Valve pop into my head.</p>
<p>Better announce it for some 2011 phones too.</p>
<p>How the heck is my HTC EVO 3D still on Gingerbread and it&#8217;s barely 6 months old!  What&#8217;s the point of going on a contract if you need to upgrade every few months just to get the latest software.. Bollox!</p>
<p>its a year old but yea it should be on JB :/</p>
<p>That was announced in Q1 2011, designed in 2010. Perhaps following tech sites closer before getting something on contract might be a good idea if you only got the HTC EVO 3D 6 months ago.</p>
<p>Get a Nexus device and you&#8217;ll never have to worry.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get a device on contract. SIM-only, preferably via virtual providers if internet speed isn&#8217;t an issue for you. Cheap and freedom over your device. It&#8217;s quite a bit more expensive at the first purchase, but you&#8217;re not stuck to a contract that ends you paying more than you&#8217;d do the way without carrier-branded phones.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my opinion, but before getting a contract &#8211; do the math. How much data/text/voice do you <strong>need</strong>, how much are you <strong>willing</strong> to pay for, and how much would you end up with via carrier contracts as opposed to one-time purchased phone and SIM-only?</p>
<p>Just worked it out, was actually 8-9 mths ago when I got it (time flies) and was only just released here in Australia at that time cause I was waiting for it to come out.  Was reading about it awhile before that though so makes sense.. Australia is obviously way behind the ball :(</p>
<p>The International version of the evo 3d already got updated to ICS, blame your carrier not HTC.</p>
<p>Carriers should stay the fuck out of this. They&#8217;re ruining everything there is to ruin about the mobile industry.</p>
<p>Well they need to sell more phones. Updating extends the life of the phone. They do make the plunge in subsidising the phone, but agreed they should have no part in the software of a phone.</p>
<p>Maybe you had it for six months but it&#8217;s older then that</p>
<p>EvO LTE love please</p>
<p>Hopefully on the One V too &#8211; its a really good cheap-ish entry level phone &#8211; just a little sluggish on 4.0. I<br />
i get the feeling that the 4.1 buttery-ness will significantly improve this device.</p>
<p>Why would they NOT give the One V some JB-action? I mean, come on, its not even 4 months since its release!</p>
<p>They&#8217;re probably going to use the Hardware excuse&#8230; Who knows though, we may be surprised. Though they&#8217;re going to have to do some pretty crazy stuff to get it working smoothly. Even on my One X I had lag scrolling through home screens. Loved it a ton, but that really frustrated me. You&#8217;d think that Jellybean would be smoother though, hence making the update possible.</p>
<p>Even Google&#8217;s Nexus S is getting the JB update and it&#8217;s two years old!</p>
<p>When I KNOW that Jelly Bean is coming to the HOX then I&#8217;ll go buy it. For now I&#8217;m sticking to the 4S and the Gnex.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it will take long till we see for JB for the International version of HOX (2-3 months at most)<br />
for the carrier bound variants I&#8217;d say 6 month  and this is the usual</p>
<p>Because of carriers we will never see stock android on the HOX. It would of been the true competitor to the iPhone 5 (unless Apple pulls of a huge stunt announcing a new hardware revolution).</p>
<p>The CM9 builds for HOX are actually rather good. Everything works.</p>
<p>Any experience concerning the duration with HTC from announcement to release? Got an One X recently, and can´t wait for Google Now!</p>
<p>If we consider the older flagship phones we see that</p>
<p>-Desire HD came out in sep-oct 2010 with FroYo 2.2 got upgraded to 2.2.1 in january and Gingerbread in May 2011, Gingerbread came out in dec 2010.<br />
-Sensation came out with Gingerbread updated in march to ICS, ICS came out in October,</p>
<p>This time Manufacturers had a little advantage called the ODK beta . so expect JB on the international phone in 3month like I said</p>
<p>Would love to get this on my new One X.</p>
<p>There is a Jelly Bean ROM.</p>

<p>for Samsung gs3,update?</p>
<p>You have it already in CM10.</p>
<p>Kinda worrying it takes this long to get a statement that says next to nothing.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s it worrying? The tools they need just became available.</p>
<p>Firstly that isn&#8217;t supposed to be true with the pdk.<br />
Secondly what does the statement say. Very very little. Why couldn&#8217;t they have said that much the very same day JB was released?</p>
<p>So a big fuck you to those who&#8217;s phones are only 8 months old? (Rezound)</p>
<p>Your phone doesn&#8217;t even have ICS yet. They could just postpone that update and leave you on gingerbread for another 6 months until JB is ready&#8230;</p>
<p>GB &#8594; ICS I understand, 6 months. ICS &#8594; JB if it takes 6 months you obviously over themed your pos rom. I&#8217;ve used a JB rom on my tablet, it seriously fixes all the issues from ICS/GB. There is no place for Sense any more.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not HTC&#8217;s fault, though. HTC has been going out of its way to let people know that they finished the ICS update on their end and that they aren&#8217;t responsible for why you don&#8217;t have it.</p>
<p>Be mad at Verizon, because they&#8217;ve been sitting on a nearly completed Rezound ICS build for a good long while, now. They&#8217;re probably trying to get people to abandon the phone for a newer model.</p>
<p>all they did was announce it for their flagship devices. But, if verizon has their way, us Rezound owners will never see it.</p>
<p>Anyway, Joelz is working on a CM10 port<br />
<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1785185" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1785185</a></p>
<p>I know how you feel. I have a rezound and it&#8217;s a good phone other then it doesn&#8217;t get any attention from Verizon. I&#8217;m done with them this fall. Getting a google phone in the fall.</p>
<p>According to Android engineers (JBQ) SE is currently the team who is working the most with AOSP, which means they are fastest to upgrade their software to the latest Android version. And SE takes about 3 months. Let&#8217;s see how long it takes for HTC.</p>
<p>Praise the tech gods!</p>
<p>OHYEAH.</p>
<p>if something is not mentioned does NOT equal its not coming. Why do people like to confuse those? Sure as hell we will see JB for the other 2012 Multicore beasts and i daresay even One V &#8211; but probably not before 2013 for the latter. Its not that big of an update to code compared to ICS. And for a Sense ROM its basically adding Now and Butter</p>
<p>How sad is it that a device less than a year old getting a software update is breaking news.</p>
<p>Now the question is&#8230; when?</p>
<p>I want jelly bean on my (international) galaxy s3 fuck u samsung , whats the point of having the best android phone out there if it doesnt get updated in time. At least HTC had the guts to go out and say it now its ur turn sammy.</p>
<p><strong>5 months later</strong></p>
<p>Where&#8217;s my update? :O</p>
<p>On the Nexus. ;-P</p>
<p>They&#8217;re only confirming that they have plans, I&#8217;m not so optimistic yet.</p>
<p>And plans are to upgrade</p>
<p>i would like to put pure ICS on my one x. HTC Sense su**s!</p>
<p>Its called CM9, the One X has some really good AOKP and CM9 ROMs, even a CM10 and AOSP JB one.</p>
<p>Any of them support LTE yet?</p>
<p>The One X does not have LTE. The One XL does.</p>
<p>The One X has more dev support, and the ROMs I listed above.</p>
<p>Oh, damn, guess I meant the XL. My bad lol</p>
<p>Hope the HTC Droid Incredible 4G LTE gets it.</p>
<p>I have the Galaxy Nexus , which received an over the air upgrade to Jelly Bean a few days ago. I must admit, at first glance it is barely any different to ICS ! So worry not people who dont have it.. you are not missing much.</p>
<p>After a few days usage I can honestly say the only differences to ICS that I have noticed are improvements to the notification centre (gmail especially now lists mails better), better use of the &#8216;remove keyboard&#8217; option in apps rather than having to press back (noticable in Handcent)</p>
<p>.. and some apps (Sky GO) no longer work on Jelly Bean</p>
<p>and thats it&#8230;.. no other real changes! All a bit of a let down really. I can understand if you are stuck on ginger bread, but being on ICS you are not missing much.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking.</p>
<p>For Google to come out during I/O and make a huge announcement on a .1 increment was puzzling. It&#8217;s not even that remotely different from ICS, mostly background stuff, but why even call it Jelly Bean? Why not just ICS 4.1? I mean, that&#8217;s what it is. No reason why all this &#8216;project butter&#8217; and &#8216;better (stolen) keyboard&quot; and now &#8220;new voice actions&#8221; couldn&#8217;t have been put under the ICS umbrella.</p>
<p>Well they weren&#8217;t going to set up a stage at their flagship conference and go &#8220;sorry guys, not much to mention, see you sometime soon!&#8221; were they? The update is probably around the same magnitude as Eclair &#8594; Froyo and Froyo &#8594; Gingerbread, so a new name is fine. Plus, its their software, they can do what they like really.</p>
<p>just plans? the wording here is poor from htc. they should already be examining the code and making merges and all that technobabble. source dropped two weeks ago (i think), and they have probably had PDK access for longer than that. they need to be a little more nimble.</p>
<p> The fact that this was even in the realm of possibility for a &#8220;flagship&#8221; phone to not get a .1 update is a complete fail on the part of HTC and El Goog.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t in the realm of possibility!</p>
<p>Just give me a working Google NOW, that&#8217;s all I want from JB.</p>
<p>Are they gonna fuck up Android with their skin again?</p>
<p>Great&#8230;  the One X will probably receive JB before my Verizon Galaxy Nexus.  F&#8217; you Verizon &#8211; you are worse than Apple.</p>
<p>This is how HTC can compete with Samsung&#8230; beat them to JB.</p>
<p>Is the update going to be stock 4.1 Jelly Bean, or is HTC going to ruin it by putting the &#8220;Sense&#8221; skin over 4.1 features? This is seriously the deciding factor in whether or not I make the switch from iOS to android by purchasing the One X.</p>

<p>They most likely will put sense 4.0/4.1 on it. There is always the option of installing a custom rom so you don&#8217;t get the sense ui.</p>

<p>sense is not just a skin, it offers a bunch of features which are not included in stock ics or even jelly bean. i actually know someone who returned his galaxy nexus because he missed those features (he is now happy with a one x).</p>
<p>Can you tell me what some of those features are other than the htc widgets and custom multitasking?</p>

<p>Has anyone got an unlocked AT&amp;T One-X running on T-Mobile 3G? HTC says it has the AWS hardware. There&#8217;s a lot of talk on XDA from Canadians trying to get the (Telus?) One-X to work on Wind without success, but very little info about AT&amp;T&#8594;T-Mobile. In the US case one would think it just a matter of unlocking and flashing the T-Mobile radio code from the One-S.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t have the AWS hardware. It has 2100/1700 bands for LTE, but it doesn&#8217;t have the 1700 band for 3G connectivity (HSPA+), so it won&#8217;t work on T-Mobile.</p>
<p>Is Samsung going to update the GS3?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2/jtc.jpg" /> Well, not surprised by HTC&#8217;s announcement.<img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2fj/fvv.jpg" /></p>
<p>Blah ditching the One X Rogers for an International SGS3 this weekend. Really don&#8217;t like the way they handled the North American One X with the sources and stuff.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll bet Samsung went &#8220;Shibal gehsehki!&#8221; when they finished updating the S2 and Note to ICS as Google announced Jellybean in the same week.<br />
The good news is the S3 is almost definitely getting 4.1. S2 and Note are maybes. The S1 never got 4.0, just a value pack update (which is sort of like what Apple did to iOS6 for iPhone 3GS but the US carriers never released it here)</p>
<p>No HTC One V yet in the announcement, probably because it uses a slightly tweaked (watered-down) version of Sense 4.0. Requires different sets of testing I guess than its big brothers, who all use the full Sense 4.0.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure this was obvious to most people. The question is: WHEN will everyone get the update?<br />
JB isn&#8217;t that big of an upgrade, so I don&#8217;t see why it should take as long as ICS did.</p>
<p>Anyone who moans about updates should just stfu and buy a Nexus device :P</p>
<p>Right, because clearly there should be no choice.</p>
<p>HTC have announced updates here for their One devices, that should be fine for most.</p>
<p>This is a stupid article, of course they&#8217;re getting ICS updates, they just came out! It would be shocking for them not to update these devices.</p>
<p>I read this and and smiling ;D So match BS that can be so easily avoided by getting a Nexus ;D I&#8217;ve received JB almost a week ago and it&#8217;s I have to say it is nice&#8230; And apart maybe pro a camera that I personally use maybe once a month (if that) I don&#8217;t see  how either Ones X or S3 are better actually speed wise even before JB  my nexus was neither faster nor slower as far as I could tell and now I actually have a device that does work faster then those two ;D Anyway&#8230; I would like to say to you that are waiting on other devices that the wait will probably be justified by JB. Good luck non-Nexus dudes and chicks ;)</p>
<p>Cool. I can&#8217;t wait for the Thunderbolt annou&#8212; OH WAIT.</p>
<p>Is this Anti-competitive/Anti-trust?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking MS and IE, you know, that lawsuit that almost split them apart?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is the same issue.</p>
<p>Considering that Ice Cream Sandwich is installed on less than 10 percent of the Android devices, I&#8217;m thinking no. And even if Jelly Bean will be installed on 90% of devices in a year, I&#8217;m still thinking no.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re just providing their users with a new app they&#8217;ve built that we may find interesting. They&#8217;re not stopping anyone from using something else. They&#8217;re even pushing this over Google Reader.</p>
<p>Microsoft never stopped you from installing another browser, but they still got sued.</p>
<p>They stopped you from uninstalling IE.<br />
Seriously, must you MS fans constantly fight everyone?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t uninstall system apps Android without root.</p>
<p>But you can deactivate them.</p>
<p>Touché.</p>
<p>lol, jb is not going to be on 90% of devices ever</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that be like Apple having Anti-Trust for safari on the iOS devices?</p>
<p>Yeah, but that actually is anti-competitive.</p>
<p>Not being able to change defaults is!</p>
<p>As well as only permitting 3rd party browser vendors to only use their gimped version of Safari Mobile which doesn&#8217;t feature the Nitro Javascript engine &amp; not allowing browser vendors to make up for that by including their own, for example Chrome&#8217;s V8 engine.</p>
<p>Apple though init</p>
<p>In the same way that Apple pre-installing iTunes or Windows pre-installing Media Player is anti-competitive/anti-trust.  So not at all really.</p>
<p>Before government could do anything about &#8220;anti-competitive&#8221; practices of Android they would have to first sue the hell out of Apple and iOS.</p>
<p>Eh. Tried it, Flipboard is better.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s indeed prettier, and allows me to browse &amp; interact within social networks like Twitter. Google needs to add those types of enhancments to make me use that again. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s still a great app.</p>
<p>Yeah.  I&#8217;m pretty sure they made Currents because Flipboard took way to long to release an Android version.</p>
<p>apparently they offered to buy them and they said no.</p>
<p>except the whole no offline ready part. I end up using Pulse and Currents because of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, same.  I grabbed Currents when it first came out, but haven&#8217;t bothered to look at it since.</p>
<p>I would like to try it  but flipboard does not support 10 inch tablets. So I use Google Currents. I have no real issues with it. I think currents will replace reader soon.</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t know why they replaced the icon with that blue one, it&#8217;s not very google looking, old icon was better.</p>
<p>New version of Currents released a couple of days ago (only tried it on my tablet) has reversed that trend and I now find it better than Flipboard.</p>
<p>yup, Flipboard = better.</p>
<p>While I like Currents&#8217; user interface to that of Flipboard, I find it amusing that the latter has better Google Reader and Google+ integration than the former does. If Currents was better at being a front-end to Reader in addition to other content, I think I would like it more. As it stands, both Flipboard and Currents make it too hard to track read and unread stories.</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230; Jelly Bean&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://i70.photobucket.com/albums/i109/LOWbikes4130/homer-drool.gif" /></p>
<p>But Flipboard does that.. that WHOOSH thing! It is a cool toy!&#8230;. Wait what we&#8217;re we talking about again</p>
<p>Found this out yesterday, while trying out JB on my Gnex&#8230;I like GReader better</p>
<p>Google+ announced intergration with Flipboard and vice-versa and now Google puts up Currents as the buundled app?! :confused:</p>
<p>Google wants to compete with anyone and everyone now. It&#8217;s why most other tech companies can&#8217;t stand them.</p>
<p>Frankly, without the ability to directly sync with Google Reader makes it a complete waste to me. I don&#8217;t really see the purpose without it, it&#8217;s just a fancy RSS reader without any syncing capabilities. Why are we taking a step backward instead of forward here?</p>
<p>Too much whitespace in Currents. Also they need to make a night-mode for it. Google, you give me nightmode for Google Play Books but then turn around and expect me to be able to read bright-ass Currents in low light? Turn that shit down it&#8217;s too damn bright!</p>
<p>Turn on auto brightness for your screen.</p>
<p>I have 2 problems with google currents.<br />
1. It takes too long to pull info.<br />
2. No windows phone support :c</p>
<p>I read The Verge on Currents and it&#8217;s great, but you have to add an option to your edition to open the articles in the browser.</p>
<p>microaoft got sued cause ie had hooks to the os that no one else had.  it was windows explorer with html capabilitiea.</p>
<p>Currents offers me the convenience of offline caching and syncing with my Google account but its lack of integration with Google Reader and Google plus and lack of view on web options are major barriers to me using it.</p>
<p>I wish they would rather make the google reader app looking like this&#8230;</p>
<p>Just sold my Galaxy S3, so i&#8217;m waiting on the update for my HTC One X, i&#8217;m using stock at  the moment but i&#8217;d like Jellybean</p>
<p>I like how OS upgrades on a few month old Android device is big news. It is kind of sad that it isn&#8217;t just expected. I blame the carriers, but until this mess is resolved it makes Android pretty unappealing to me.</p>
<p>To be fair, iOS6 was announced on June 11th, and my iPad still isn&#8217;t running it.  On the other hand, Jelly Bean was announced on June 27th, and I&#8217;m already running it on my One X, albeit &#8220;unofficially&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not saying Android doesn&#8217;t have a long way to go when it comes to getting updates out quickly, but if you&#8217;re willing to tinker, you can often get updates even faster than iOS.</p>
<p>Announced != released</p>
<p>How is that relevant?</p>
<p>Because it isn&#8217;t out yet.</p>
<p>So? Apple has a different cycle than Google. Why even compare the two updates if their release style is completely different?</p>
<p>Android 2.2 or 10.12,  ios 1.0 or 20.6 you will end up doing the same thing, i.e accessing the Internet and passing the whole day at the verge, Facebook, g+, twitter etc&#8230;          What a first world problem in all this android vs ios debate</p>
<p>because once iOS6 is actually publicly released, a very sognificant fraction of Apple devices will be running iOS6 within a week of its release.</p>
<p>Sounds absolutely <strong>splondid</strong>.</p>
<p>:( I still haven&#8217;t mastered accurate typing on my iPad.</p>
<p>I feel ya bro :( I often end up talking to it instead of writing, but I can&#8217;t really do that other places than at home.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good idea! Is dictation on it really accurate?</p>
<p>More importantly many apps are updated and ready to leverage the new iOS features.</p>
<p>Touchwiz Android 4.1.1 hasn&#8217;t been released either if you want to play the semantics game.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your point? Once an updated JellyBean for the GSIII is released, a very significant of GSIII&#8217;s will also be running JellyBean&#8230;?</p>
<p>For one, Jellybean has been released already. Secondly, he said a significant fraction of Apple (any iOS) devices will be running it. Where as the GSIII is only one of many android devices and thus a small fraction of Android devices will be running Jellybean.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really how it works: The &#8220;JellyBean&#8221; you&#8217;re referring to is not what Samsung GSIII&#8217;s have. That&#8217;s only marginally different from claiming that the Nokia Lumia is outdated because it doesn&#8217;t have iOS 5 yet.</p>
<p>The next iteration of TouchWiz (which, while related to JellyBean, is not simply JellyBean) for the GSIII has not yet been released &#8212; when it is, a significant number of GSIII&#8217;s will be running it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Touchwiz Jellybean like Ubuntu Linux.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it&#8217;s not quite like saying a Lumia doesn&#8217;t have iOS.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s so wrong. Jellybean refers to the API level. Touchwiz is merely a skin and some additional features on top of jellybean.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an android developer, and trust me, android version fragmentation really is an issue. Google themselves recommend you target android 2.2 because so many users are running outdated versions!</p>
<p>Jellybean, the source code has been released. <br />
TouchWiz-Jellybean, for GS3 (which is supposed to be realesed by Samsung) has NOT been released. But whenever it be released, it will be on significant number of GS3s within days.</p>
<p>So in Android people are always up to date, even if the OEM doesn&#8217;t release a 4.1 version. Great stuff.</p>
<p>Did you even read what i typed?</p>
<p>The reason why my iPhone 4 doesn&#8217;t have iOS 6 yet isn&#8217;t because AT&amp;T decided that my phone doesn&#8217;t deserve it, or because some hardware manufacturer doesn&#8217;t think it will be worth their time to get it running on my hardware, it&#8217;s because Apple and app developers are working on getting the bugs out of it.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t see the difference you really shouldn&#8217;t be making snide remarks.</p>
<p>Samsung and the other Manufacturers are doing the same thing. You think they magically have a working, skinned version Android? Either way it takes 5+ months for Apple to release an update after they announce it. You don&#8217;t known how much of that time is due to carriers approving the update. Apple must at least run it by them  and waits until they are ALL ready before release it. Would you have a problem if they released the new version to unlocked phones after 2 months, then to  AT&amp;T phones after 4 months, Verizon after 5 and then everyone else 6 months after announcement?</p>
<p>Thats not really true, as Apple has too much leverage, no carrier would risk now having access to the iPhone, why do you think the carriers full price and then offer it for $200 on a plan, because even so they earn tons on the iPhone&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>why do you think the carriers full price and then offer it for $200 on a plan, because even so they earn tons on the iPhone</blockquote>
<p>Okay, since when did providers suddenly start earning tons of money when selling iphones, I didn&#8217;t know apple suddenly changed its policy about the pricing for providers?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re kidding right? When the new version of Android comes out manufacturers only care about upgrading the <strong>very latest </strong>flagship phones.</p>
<p>As a customer, I don&#8217;t see why any of that matters. I don&#8217;t care if Samsung is trying really hard (not that I think they are). I know that when I buy a new iPhone, I am going to get updates the day every other iPhone user can for the length of my contract. It doesn&#8217;t matter what network I&#8217;m on. It doesn&#8217;t matter if there is a newer iPhone out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running iOS 6 on my iPad since it was announced.</p>
<blockquote>but if you’re willing to tinker, you can often get updates even faster than iOS.</blockquote>
<p>iOS 6 Beta was announced in June and it was made available to the developers the same day. 3 more beta updates have been made available since then. Comparing the speed of iOS updates with Android updates as if there is some parity, let alone claiming that you can get Android updates faster, is just plain ridiculous.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making broad statements about which OS is better about getting updates out.  In fact, I <em>agree </em>that iOS is much better, overall, in that regard &#8211; even if I think Apple unnecessarily removes features from certain hardware (see: turn-by-turn directions in the iPhone 4).</p>
<p>My point was simply to state my own personal experience: Android 4.1 was announced after iOS6, yet I&#8217;m able to run Android 4.1 on my phone but not iOS6 on tablet.  I could install the iOS6 beta, but in general, I find that less reliable than flashing Android ROMs, because if I flash a ROM I don&#8217;t like, going back to another ROM is simple.  Downgrading iOS is a whole different ballgame.</p>
<blockquote>Downgrading iOS is a whole different ballgame.</blockquote>
<p>while you can&#8217;t downgrade to iOS 4, Apple is still signing 5.1.1 and 6.0 releases. DFU mode easily downgrade your software with no tweaks, hacks, anything.</p>
<p>also, it&#8217;s worth noting most people revert from rom&#8217;s due to things not working; ie cm10 for the sg3, where the latest dailies just go sound working again, forget about netflix etc. That doesn&#8217;t happen with iOS because of the limited amount of hardware it runs on. The second i had iOS 6 beta 1, all the functions of my ipad still worked.(there was funkyness with the fresh maps app tho!)</p>
<p>That being said, it did actually happen once, when people were using an ipad baseband on their 3gs&#8217;s (if i remember correctly) They lost GPS (until a patch was made) so while it&#8217;s a rarity, it&#8217;s not ruled out.</p>
<p>Well, you are indeed aware of that CM10 is built and maintained by a whole bunch of devs with no pay???? They sacrifice a plenty of spare time working on this project and got no support or resources from OEM or google. But they made their project available on a variety of phones and tablets.  That&#8217;s pretty massive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, iOS is exclusively built by Apple &#8211; The most market capital-ed company around the world and has many well paid developers on board&#8230;</p>
<p>That</p>
<p>How is this relevant to the end user? One works well, the other is buggy and that&#8217;s that. <br />
You don&#8217;t drive a shitty half broken car just because your neighbour constructed it using scrap materials he found on the street,  do you? You buy a mass production car that you know will get you from A to B reliably, economically, in style.</p>
<p>I downloaded a 4.1 rom the second it was available for my VZW GNex. The only bug was problems with weakened WiFi and GPS. This was fixed by flashing a fixed package, something that took 30 seconds.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t say one is buggy and that&#8217;s that. There&#8217;s a difference between nightlys and actual releases of roms, and if you&#8217;re using a nightly, you should expect bugs.</p>
<p>you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.. you obviously haven&#8217;t seen it from any closer than &#8216;someone mentioning it to you&#8217;,  yet you think you can describe it in the most condescending tone.  ignorance it is called I believe..</p>
<p>You were comparing Apple to Orange right here. Get your concept straight first.</p>
<p>If you really want to compare these two ecosystems and their respective devices, then you should compare Android 4.1.1 on Google Nexus and iOS 6 Beta on iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Note that SGSIII is supported by Samsung, not Google. CM10 isn&#8217;t supported by either Samsung or Google. You are here talking about customized Android OS here. Its counterpart should be customized IPSW on iOS. You might run into bugs and you should expect bugs if you flash those customized stuff into your device.</p>
<p>And the right analog should be: You have all the rights to drive a mass production car with a customized engine. If you can drive it reliably from A to B, then do <strong>NOT</strong> blame the car manufacturer, blame yourself choosing to install the non-certificated engine.</p>
<p>EDIT:  If you can <strong>NOT</strong> drive it reliably from A to B</p>
<p>How much of a pathetic troll are you ?</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m able to run Android 4.1 on my phone but not iOS6 on tablet&#8221;<br />
&quot; I could install the iOS6 beta&quot;</p>
<p>So you CAN run iOS6 on your tablet but you CHOOSE not to.</p>
<p>That was because iOS 6 wasn&#8217;t &#8220;announced&#8221; Apple announced that they are in progress of developing iOS 6 to let the developers know at the World Wide <strong>Developer</strong> Conference.<br />
To compare, it&#8217;s more akin to Google announcing existence of Ice Cream Sandwich in Google I/O 2011 during summer and releasing it on AOSP during autumn.</p>
<p>Apple and Oranges. iOS released a beta to developers, Jelly Bean was released to the public. Not beta, they launched final version.</p>
<p>Jekly Bean was announced early June and the final version was rolled out a couple weeks later. Apple announced iOS 6 even earlier and it is still 2 months out. Even the CDMA Nexus devices will be updated by then, and they will get all features unlike iPhone.</p>
<p>one thing everyone acknowledges about the broadness of hardware for android is the fact that it is so difficult and a logistical nightmare to release updates to all devices at once, and so some get it early and some getting later or never. This is something iOS has an advantage over android</p>
<p>give it up trying to convince yourself otherwise</p>
<p>and buy Nexus, so you have best of both worlds ;)<br />
or just root.. <br />
it&#8217;s like the apple way, but 10 times better ;)</p>
<p>Yes, if &#8220;10 times better&#8221; means shitty camera and shitty battery life.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean is available for flashing the night it is announced.</p>
<p>Because Google releases software in a diferent way then Apple. When Apple announces the new version, it&#8217;s BETA. The OS is not ready for prime time, and no consumer gets his hands on it, only developers.</p>
<p>When Google announces, it&#8217;s the final version, the public gets immediate access.</p>
<p>When the product is released to the public, all Apple users get the OS at the same time, while Android users have to wait for ages. That&#8217;s fact. People are trying to argue semantics and compare at isn&#8217;t comparable (closed beta vs public release).</p>
<p>not if you buy nexus, with stock android</p>
<p>you&#8217;re talking about that touchwiz- &amp; sense-crap, which takes longer..</p>
<p>nexus is very comparable to apple no ? buy from the company who releases hard-&amp;software, no intervention from third-party needed and vanilla experience with immediate updates..</p>
<p>iOS6 will only be available on essentially 1 phone. Jelly Bean is only officially available on 1 phone as well with many more to come. So it seems to me that you&#8217;re complaining about variety.</p>
<p>iOS6 will be available for 3GS, 4, 4s, iPod Touch, iPad 2, iPad 3.</p>
<p>iOS6 will be available for 3GS, 4, 4s, iPod Touch, iPad 2, iPad 3.*</p>
<p>*With limited functionality</p>
<p>FTFY ;)</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s good and makes sense. Because they prefer having a stable and non-laggy os based on the age of the hardware of your device, instead of having all the features with a functionally shitty, laggy and ugly implementation. Yes I&#8217;m looking at you Touchwiz. And that&#8217;s also what I and many Apple users prefer as well.</p>
<p>If you really need it, you still have the option to jailbreak your device and install whatever you need. Then you will almost certainly have lag though if you&#8217;re on an older device. It&#8217;s up to you. At least you have the choice, with Android you always have the lag, except for stock Jelly Bean maybe.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t find any limited functionality on my iPad 3 though..</p>
<p>Sorry but 3GS runs like a dog with iOS 5, it&#8217;s a crashy and laggy POS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to call you out on this. You are just making shit up.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that I have the 3GS running that version perfectly fine for months now, even the first Beta of iOS 5 on 3GS works fine: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5EqVGaxtok" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5EqVGaxtok</a></p>
<p>I owned an iPhone 3GS with iOS 5 on it and though it wasn&#8217;t as fast as an iPhone 4S, it was still pretty smooth and not crashy at all</p>
<p>&#8220;instead of having all the features with a functionally shitty, laggy and ugly implementation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Funny, every update to Android makes my phone work faster. Every update to an iOS device seems to make it work slower.</p>
<p>Funny that.</p>
<p>You must have stock Android ICS or JellyBean then or a mod.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re gonna count running things unofficially then why not run the beta build of iOS 6?   It&#8217;s much more full featured than most alpha or beta JB builds at this point.</p>
<p>If you are willing to tinker you can get iOS 6 TODAY.</p>
<p>iOS6 is available for download by developers the day it is announced.</p>
<p>You are the worst kind of troll. Nothing but lies.</p>
<p>To be fair, iOS beta 1 came out that same day (June 11th), so if you were willing to tinker you could have used it. Granted, it&#8217;d be buggy but the point remains &#8212; you&#8217;re using pre-release builds.</p>
<p>You can get the iOS 6 beta.</p>
<p>And this is what people need to see; Google is the only ones who have the source before its release. They can update their Nexus devices and release the source the same time, where then and only then will the manufacturers actually managed to download and begin working on the new version. Apple obviously works on iOs 6 months prior to release, and then a couple more months after betas to official release. Android manufacturers are hardly much different, they works on their updates, put it through rigorous testing, then release it. Some manfacturers suck and take a year to do it, but look at ASUS, they&#8217;re already outing updates in record time, and Samsung already had 3 jellybean leaks, hinting that it&#8217;s coming very soon. Basically, cut manfacturers some slack, they can&#8217;t port in one day. Just don&#8217;t cut them slack if they start taking a whole year.</p>
<p>that is the stupidest comment i&#8217;ve read in a while. iOS 6 is NOT OUT. It is only available in BETA flavors to developers. This is, btw, is the right way to release a new OS. Google hides Android till they release on their champion device not giving a shit about the developers who might wanna synchro new features and release cycles with upcoming OS releases. Doesn&#8217;t matter anyway, not many devices get these updates.</p>
<p>As @Chat pointed out, this shouldn&#8217;t be a significant piece of news. And I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;m not the only one annoyed with TouchWiz. Samsung is murdering Android. But I get it&#8230; it&#8217;s psuedo-open-sourced so whatever rocks your boat.</p>
<p>Get an unlocked NEXUS. Problem solved.</p>
<p>If this is true, then I don&#8217;t blame the carriers. I guess it is the manufacturers after-all.</p>
<p>Nexus isn&#8217;t carrier controlled phone. So, there&#8217;s no delay with update.</p>
<p>Other phones are controlled by carriers. They push out the update and they are the biggest reason of the delay.</p>
<p>Except Canada as far as I know</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised&#8230;. You think the American telecoms are devils?? The Canadian ones are even worst!</p>
<p>EDIT: worse</p>
<p>P.S. Damn&#8230; We really need an Edit button!!!!</p>
<p>If the Nexus phones aren&#8217;t controlled by carriers, then it stands to reason that other phones could be created that aren&#8217;t controlled by carriers, and so the only party to blame is the manufacturers who let themselves be controlled. Apple and Google seem to have found a way to avoid this interference.</p>
<p>The only company that&#8217;s even close to avoid it like Apple or Google&#8217;s Nexus device is Samsung and they still get bloatware installed, but now the carriers don&#8217;t force new models or device names for their network so Samsung is the closest so far, but not completely out of the will of carriers in the US.</p>
<p>It all comes down to who is the customer in this case.  If you buy an unlocked phone from the manufacturer, you&#8217;re the customer.  If you buy a subsidized phone from your carrier (with the exception of the iPhone and maybe Blackberry), the carrier is the customer the manufacturer is catering to.</p>
<p>You know how much your carrier cares about your business when they&#8217;ve got you in a two or three year contract, right?  &#8220;You&#8217;ll pay and like it, because if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll pay more!&#8221;</p>
<p>I got Jelly Bean within 3 days of it being released.  The trick is to get a Nexus device.  If you don&#8217;t do that then you really have no room for legitimate complaining.</p>
<p>you are obviously forgetting about the VZW Gnex. honestly i think manufacturers would update 1000x faster if they didnt have to add carrier bloatware.</p>
<p>As long as it&#8217;s a yakju nexus. They forget to tell you that part.</p>
<p>But if you know how, it&#8217;s reasonably easy to turn your non-yakju Nexus into a yakju Nexus.</p>
<p>Actually it&#8217;s google&#8217;s fault for not having a proper unified driver model.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean on the One X is amazing.  I&#8217;ve been running CM10 for the last couple of weeks and it&#8217;d be really hard to go back to ICS.</p>
<p>Ive actually missed Sense! Im so ready for the official update!</p>
<p>Really?  The only thing I miss in Sense is the camera app.</p>
<p>I miss the weather lockscreen, the stability, the batterylife, the way better than CM10 automatic brightness settings.</p>
<p>I mean I love CM Ive always been a fan, but Sense gave me a carefree way to just use the phone, I only Flashed CM10 to check out project butter and Google Now, but as impressively stable as it is, Stock Sense is just honestly WAY more solid.</p>
<p>Fair enough.  I&#8217;ve admittedly been tempted to go back to a Sense ROM just to see how things have changed (especially with Sense 4.1).</p>
<p>Same here, I&#8217;m just waiting for a surprise headline saying EXCLUSIVE: Jelly Bean Update Announced!</p>
<p>&#8230;a man can dream&#8230;</p>
<p>True.  Oh, and while the Sense weather lockscreen is fancy, I think I actually prefer the functionality of the CM10 lockscreen, since I get weather, calendar, and the more-configurable lockscreen shortcuts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also come to really, really love Google Now, so leaving that behind would be hard.  I know it&#8217;s been ported to ICS in some forms, but I don&#8217;t know how functional it is in Sense ROMs.</p>
<p>Stock jelly bean all the way man. I was also very impressed with Google Now. A (sort of VA) that isn&#8217;t simply a gimmick, I can actually see myself using it in the future.</p>
<p>I always thought talking to make a phone do things looked ridiculous, until I started trying it (instead of typing) and it&#8217;s awesome&#8230;.. voice recognition is really good, and the answers or actions are spot on<br />
And the part I like best, is that it thinks for me..</p>
<p>Tells me in the morning what kind of traffic there is and which route to take cause it &#8216;learned&#8217; my habit, or inform me when to leave for an appointment based on where I am, how late and where the appointment is and what kind of traffic I&#8217;m gonna get..<br />
grrreeat..</p>
<p>Same, but the cm10 rom had so many issues here and there i just couldn&#8217;t be bothered so i went back to stock.</p>
<p>Really?  I&#8217;ve found it to be almost issue-free at this point.</p>
<p>I had random reboots, GPS thought i was in the middle of the Atlantic sea <del>_</del> . and then it froze and i had to reboot it cause screen wouldn&#8217;t turn on, and it was everyday, Stock has no issue, i&#8217;m missing Jellybean features but official update will come soon enough.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s the battery life? I&#8217;m hesitant to move to CM10 from cleanrom because cleanrom is so stable and reliable. Can you post a little review of CM10 on one x (Snapdragon version). Thanks.</p>
<p>Also, what happens to my titanium backup if i move from sense to cm10. How does my screen and the settings get restored?</p>
<p>See? This is how this thread should have gone. Instead, Chat decided he had to completely derail the entire comment section by starting a flame war.</p>
<p>Why would you sell your SGS3 and get a HOX? Overheating problems, no fully unlockable bootloader and an array of other problems. I&#8217;m astonished.</p>
<p>No, i had the HTC One X from the day it was released, then i got the S3 for free but i hated the screen and plasticky feel, One X just feels more premium</p>
<p>Im the opposite, I have a One X that I am wanting to ditch for an S3!  I had the GS3 before and it is the best phone out there imo</p>
<p>What ever did happen to the Verizon Galaxy Nexus&#8217; update?</p>
<p>you answered your own question&#8230;.Verizon</p>
<p>It&#8217;s in Verizon&#8217;s certification process to make sure Google hasn&#8217;t mucked up another update by riddling it with bugs that compromise cellular, messaging or some other critical service that a phone owner might need to use. Like I&#8217;ve said many times in the past, Google would help itself get through the process quicker and better if it didn&#8217;t release buggy beta builds of their software. They did that with 4.0.3, which is why VZW skipped that one altogether. 6 months later, 4.0.4 was ready and it was a shortly thereafter that it found its way to our devices. Don&#8217;t blame VZW. They&#8217;re doing the due diligence that Google should have done in the first place. You&#8217;d never have this issue with Apple because their software is usually bulletproof. Even if they had to go through carrier certification, Apple&#8217;s software is rarely if at all buggy.</p>
<p>^ Verizon Employee</p>
<p>Verizon customer. Thanks. I&#8217;ve suffered through the original Droid updates. I waited the six months for ICS. So, I&#8217;m right there with all the others waiting patiently for JB on the GNex. I just found out where I need to direct my disdain. It&#8217;s not with VZW. They do what they can. But when Google releases buggy software, that&#8217;s not on VZW to fix. That&#8217;s on Google to get right from day 1.</p>
<p>There is no way you are just a customer.  No sane human is so emotionally invested in their wireless carrier.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe the sanity is the issue.</p>
<p>I love my mobile network :(.</p>
<p>first, you don&#8217;t know that. (he&#8217;s not just a customer) second, there&#8217;s no need to go ad hom.</p>
<p>I wish courtesy really was contagious. MTA are a bunch of liars.</p>
<p>Damnit Jesse, this is the second time in a month that you have pointed out I was being an asshole (paraphrasing) and were right about it.</p>
<p>we all do it sometimes, if you ever catch me i expect the same:D</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not invested in my wireless carrier. Having just been in London, I realize now that VZW is no longer a viable option. I need to be able to swap out SIM cards and use my phone no matter where I&#8217;m at. Yeah, great service at home, but nada overseas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m not upset at how long it takes VZW to approve software, but I&#8217;m MORE upset that Google can&#8217;t get their stupid software right from day 1. I&#8217;m not asking for perfection, just make sure my GPS works and my cellular radios are intact. Is that too much to ask from el Googs?</p>
<p>hmmm&#8230; maybe an iPhone or Windows Phone would suit you more in your situation? Having owned an original Galaxy S with buggered GPS I can relate to things not working and getting shafted by large corporations but it didn&#8217;t bother me as much it seems. If it&#8217;s making you angry I&#8217;d switch phones <del>-</del> not worth the stress.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the one upset. I&#8217;m patiently waiting for JB on my GNex. I love my Nexus devices. I only wish I got the GSM one when I was hopping around London.</p>
<p>I dunno man.. it&#8217;s SOLID on my GSM Galaxy Nexus that i&#8217;ve had since 11/2011.</p>
<p>Except, mine ain&#8217;t GSM (I wish). It&#8217;s LTE. There&#8217;s a difference. Those two devices aren&#8217;t the same (obviously). Previously, AOSP support for &#8220;toro&#8221; was limited due to the presence of a proprietary rotation sensor by Invensys and the CDMA/LTE binaries for provisioning on Verizon. Same but different, I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
<p>Actually LTE is part of the GSM tree.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but that the initial JB leak had issues on Verizon&#8217;s GNex. Why? I can&#8217;t explain. But now that Google has those binaries, toro is back in the AOSP, and from what I gather, the recent leak is solid. So, I don&#8217;t anticipate it being much longer.</p>
<p>Because maybe Google needs updated binaries. Running UTMS + LTE is a pretty standard setup, CDMA + LTE is not.</p>
<p>Seriously&#8230;all carriers suck and you defending verizon? Wow just wow&#8230;.<br />
AT&amp;T blocking Facetime, Verizon blocking Google Wallet and you know where we are heading? If you are Verizon employee&#8230;just know that you should behave like a dumb pipe &#8230; there are other companies who can do innovation.</p>
<blockquote>all carriers suck</blockquote>
<p>Not all, just US ones.</p>
<p>I got Wallet on my GNex LTE, unrooted and stock. Just added my Discover card the other day. I&#8217;m not defending VZW as much as I&#8217;m not giving Google a free pass. I don&#8217;t know why people are all over Google&#8217;s knob as if they can&#8217;t make a mistake. It would benefit all the parties if things were as close to right from day 1.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s google&#8217;s fault actually&#8230; they offered the carriers an &#8220;open source&#8221; OS that gave the carriers full control over the devices.  That&#8217;s why Verizon went with Android over webOS.</p>
<p>Worlds First Verizon Fanboy.</p>
<p>So basically youre saying an update appears and you wait for the next one to fix the new bugs introduced.<br />
Arent you just constantly waiting then?</p>
<p>Come on bro. Think a little bit before you speak. Obviously that&#8217;s not the case. You&#8217;ll get updates that have minor bugs. But when your update contains bugs that affect CORE TELEPHONY services, that&#8217;s a problem. Remember the fiasco with the Fascinate? VZW let through software that severely compromised GPS functionality. In addition, it left many customers with corrupted software that people were experiencing locked up devices, inadvertent screen capturing and the inability to make telephone calls. You think VZW wants another Fascinate fiasco? Doubt it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you fully understand the story with the fascinate, that is basically a hardware issue, not an update issue. And if I had to choose between potentially buggy software, and waiting until the crack of never for an update, I&#8217;ll take my chances.</p>
<p>And that makes a lot of sense for consumers. Makes no sense for VZW. That buggy software means customer service lines clogged with non-techies asking what the heck happened. If you&#8217;re the kind who will take your chances, chances are, you&#8217;ve already rooted and flashed a ROM. So, this stuff ain&#8217;t about you. The ordinary consumer could care less when they get the updates as long as it works. My non-techie friend has the Fascinate. He couldn&#8217;t WAIT to launch it into the river. It was a hardware issue regarding GPS, but locking up? Inadvertently taking screen shots? That&#8217;s software buddy.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t care less&#8230;.COULDN&#8217;T<br />
Do you understand me!?!</p>
<p>From :<br />
<blockquote>VZW let through software that severely compromised GPS functionality</blockquote><br />

In just one post! <br />
Followed by:<br />
<blockquote>Inadvertently taking screen shots? That’s software buddy.</blockquote><br />
Two sample-size-of-one bugs without citations, well played, it&#8217;s hard to refute that.  No mention from you of the fact that there were bugs in the phone to begin with.  Verizon made SO DAMN SURE those software bugs were ironed out, but somehow missed a mass GPS hardware issue?</p>
<p>I hate to sound like a broken record, but do a search. The Fascinate&#8217;s GPS issues vacillated between a hardware issue and a software issue. If you jump over to XDA, you can find threads full of opinions on it. The inadvertent screen shot issue could be fixed by a software change, but it was never released. It was left to the smart XDA guys to figure out a software solution.</p>
<p>VZW didn&#8217;t do their due diligence there and didn&#8217;t help put out a software fix or patch that would help the affected devices of some customers. People would obtain refurbished devices having the same issues. It was a mess.</p>
<p>HAHAHAHA The fact that you are doubling down on blaming software for the GPS issues shows that you are comfortable claiming speculation as fact.  I own a Vibrant and have been in the trenches of this issue for two and a half years.  The only reason you even think that is because you followed your advice (albeit poorly) and did a search, but only a superficial one.</p>
<p>Okay, if you say so. You&#8217;re the one with the broken Vibrant, stuck with it for 2.5 years. I defer to you, the expert of all issues concerning the Galaxy S US variants.</p>
<p>where are the JB bugs?  Im sitting happy here with my GSM unlocked Gnex.</p>
<p>By JB bugs he means the inability of Verizon to lock down parts of the OS so they can nickle and dime you further.</p>
<p>HA!</p>
<p>Lock down which parts? You&#8217;re talking about Wallet? Got it on mine, non-root, stock. What else did they &#8220;lock down&#8221; and how are they &#8220;nickle and diming&#8221; me?</p>
<p>The reason you have Wallet is because Verizon ceded to Google after <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5865580/verizon-is-screwing-the-galaxy-nexus-by-blocking-google-wallet">fighting them hard</a> and finally giving up; and not because Verizon is such an angel.</p>
<p>By the way, they also let you tether data now because they&#8217;ve been forced by the FCC to do so.</p>
<p>I installed Wallet 10 days after the GNex LTE launched. I&#8217;ve been tethering well before the FCC got involved. Unrooted. Stock. There&#8217;s always a way.</p>
<p>What way, please enlighten me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called Google. Seriously, it saves lives.</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;ve never been a customer of Verizon. <br />
I googled, but couldn&#8217;t find anything for &#8220;free tethering on verizon&#8221; and all I could find was Verizon unblocking tethering apps AFTER the FCC ruling.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re saying that Verizon let you tether for free before the FCC ruling, please tell us how.</p>
<p>Sorry, with the reputation of things being shared on the Verge and then things getting shut down. I&#8217;m not willing to let the cat out of the bag and lose my ability to tether. My Nexus 7 depends on it. Just do a search and you&#8217;ll find it.</p>
<p>So you found a backdoor or something similar. This just proves my point that Verizon would do anything to nickle and dime you. Tethering wasn&#8217;t offered for free until they were forced to do so.</p>
<p>I downloaded it off the Play Store. No backdoor needed. Both Wallet and tethering. Swear!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re lying. All I&#8217;m saying is that the method you used to tether (a third party app in this case) is/was a backdoor. Verizon didn&#8217;t allow it before the FCC ruling.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t know how it works. I&#8217;m not an engineer nor did I code the app. All I know is it works and works well.</p>
<p>let&#8217;s recap:</p>
<p>The original point is that Verizon has removed features in the VZW GNEX so they can ask consumers to pay extra for them.</p>
<p>You asked which ones, you were answered: tethering.</p>
<p>Tethering has been an off-the shelf feature of Android OS (since 2.2, actually). Not a third-party app, an OS level feature.</p>
<p>That feature is nowhere to be found in the VZW GNEX&#8217; version of Android 4.0.</p>
<p>So, you found a workaround. good for you. I hope you realize, though, that your workaround is irrelevant to the discussion. Verizon REMOVED stock functionality from the GNex in order to charge extra to costumers (to be fair, same did AT&amp;T with the iPhone</p>
<p>In fact, if according to you, Verizon doesn&#8217;t do such thing as removing or blocking functionality, ¿why are you afraid of saying what app you&#8217;re using?</p>
<p>Denial. He doesn&#8217;t want to admit he&#8217;s being nickel and dimed.</p>
<p>FoxFi is the app my wife uses.  Also, Verizon can block what you see through the Play store on your phone, but they can&#8217;t block it through the website.  Even if FoxFi was blocked, you can install it remotely through the Play website just like you can with Wallet.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s a FCC case waiting to happen with regard to net neutrality.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fantastic for you, but you&#8217;re likely not one of the carriers that suffered from affected devices since you mentioned it&#8217;s a GSM version.  When the first GSM leak of Jelly Bean arrived it came with a GPS location fix issue. After that, there was the first signs of a Verizon GNex version, but that was riddled with radio issues and no LTE support. That was at the end of July. Google goes back and fixes that issue and here we are today: a version currently posted on Google&#8217;s servers and going through VZW&#8217;s certification process.</p>
<p>Oh no! A bug! If only they could quickly push a fix&#8230;oh wait.</p>
<p>Push a fix that didn&#8217;t include more bugs! Oh no! Remember 4.0.2, came out a week after launch? That was supposed to fix the 4.0.1 bugs. Guess what? It introduced more bugs. SIX MONTHS later, 4.0.4. Pretty solid. Guess waiting helps.</p>
<p>what the hell is bulletproof about iOS?</p>
<p>Pretty much most of it. I think the most glaring issue was battery life and that&#8217;s not clear if it was a software issue or people&#8217;s inability to cope with all the new notifications and syncing capabilities of the software.</p>
<p>Do enlighten me what isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;rarely if at all buggy&#8221; &#8212; sooper has no idea on how software development works.</p>
<p>No software can be 100% bug free.</p>
<p>As I said above, there will be some (minor) bugs. But when (major) bugs affect core telephony and phone operation, it&#8217;s a no-go.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re saying that a HARDWARE issue with the Fascinate = SOFTWARE glitch in Android, then I&#8217;m sorry, I don&#8217;t know how to respond to that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m saying that it wasn&#8217;t clear. Yes, initially, it was considered a software issue. Then it was called a hardware issue.  But it wasn&#8217;t the only issue plaguing the Fascinate&#8217;s software. Just do a search. You&#8217;ll find a long list that&#8217;s software related.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if the problem is indeed hardware then both Samsung and Google are to blame. Samsung for picking a piece of shit component and Google for not having an enforced hardware guideline (approved components, etc).</p>
<p>Most GSM networks are able todo that in a few hours.</p>
<blockquote>Apple’s software is rarely if at all buggy.</blockquote>
<p>You lost me here.  If thats the case iOS would never be on .&#215;.x increments</p>
<p>And there were no updates that ten minutes later, the internet wasn&#8217;t screaming, WTF?!??!</p>
<p>My WiFi never got busted by an update, and it certainly didn&#8217;t get busted three times.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Sorry, maybe I should clarify. Major telephony bugs. Battery life bug, maybe. But a bug that kills cellular? GPS? Can&#8217;t say I remember iOS having those issues.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry. You are way too active on this topic to not be full time PR.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re pretty active yourself. I&#8217;m just replying to those who took the time to reply to me. Is that wrong? Or did I break a Verge rule?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t like what he is saying. Must be PR.</p>
<p>A lot of people work jobs that don&#8217;t require them to actively be doing something at all times. Also, a lot of people work jobs at different shifts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not true that Apple&#8217;s software is &#8216;rarely if at all buggy&#8217;.  I remember having VPN broken with iOS4, then they did THREE updates (claiming to have fixed the same issue) before VPN started working again.  When iOS5 came out I had all kinds of issues, some they fixed, some they didn&#8217;t.  It sure wasn&#8217;t fun waiting for 5.0.1 and having to click purchase on an app 10+ times before it actually did it rather than giving some generic error.</p>
<p>Apple spend like 3 months testing iOS.</p>
<p>Hint, there are quite a few different types of VPN. I&#8217;m sure while yours didn&#8217;t work in the beginning of iOS 4, PPTP or L2TP or IPSEC users were fine.</p>
<p>L2TP on android is still hit and miss for me.</p>
<p>Can you explain to me how every other carrier managed to bear the horrible burden of Android bugs crushing down their networks, and yet VZW cannot seem to do so?</p>
<p>Verizon didn&#8217;t skip 4.0.3. Google just didn&#8217;t package and build it for the GNex. It was a Nexus S and Moto Xoom update only, and the base version for OEMs.</p>
<p>Jean Baptiste-Queru stated on the AOSP list that running 4.0.3 on the Galaxy Nexus isn&#8217;t recommended.</p>
<p>If a customer wants it, why cant Verizon just make the &#8220;buggy&#8221; software an optional download?</p>
<p>Your network is delaying it.</p>
<p>For good reason.</p>
<p>Just. No.</p>
<p>Your opinion. You&#8217;re entitled to it, as am I. Don&#8217;t give Google a free pass. They&#8217;re not infallible.</p>
<p>For the love of smartphones, how is it Google&#8217;s fault that Verizon doesn&#8217;t release the goddamn update. And please stop spreading FUD about glaring bugs and w/e.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the update for the unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexuses running yakjuxw?</p>
<p>Oh, right, Samsung is still delaying it.</p>
<p>Indeed. That is truly annoying.</p>
<p>And yakjuux (Canadian)?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m utterly shocked by how bad this has been</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you just flash the same update.zip as the other GSM one? I heard it works.</p>
<p>Yes. And once you do the direct yakjuxw updates work.</p>
<p>I like how phones have somehow created this idea that the customer having to flash all these things is &#8220;acceptable.&#8221; Imagine years ago if you had to try and flash your VCR, DVD player, or some other device to get things working. You&#8217;d be pissed off.</p>
<p>Yet, with phones, it&#8217;s acceptable for some reason.</p>
<p>Because phones are more like computers than like VCRs and DVD players these days and geeks like to tinker with computers.</p>
<p>What I like is how it&#8217;s  acceptable for phones to become totally locked down but if it was a computer, everyone would be up in arms.</p>
<p>Technology has changed and improved.</p>
<p>I check once a month to see if there&#8217;s an update for my Smart TV, Blu-ray player, and NAS.</p>
<p>You forget the early days of DVD. You did have to flash early players to improve compatibility. The early days of DVD recordables too &#8211; heck some brands of media still act up in certain drives.</p>
<p>Yes. And I&#8217;ve done this. But I didn&#8217;t expect I would have to. When Jelly Bean updates started coming, I had a co-worker tell me how he was so excited he was hitting the check for updates button every hour or two. I explained to him that it wouldn&#8217;t do anything since only Yakju phones were part of the OTA and he had a Yakjuux. After I got the OTA that night (since I flashed Yakju) he got me to flash his phone to Yakju the next day. He would have a been a very unhappy customer if I wasn&#8217;t around. I can only imaging there are others like him who haven&#8217;t been able to get to Yakju.</p>
<p>I was stuck on 4.0.2 yakjuxw for a good 8 months after I got my GNex, and I&#8217;d just had enough once 4.1 was announced. If you feel like going through the process of re-doing everything with a fresh factory handset, I would definitely recommend flashing the yakju version of 4.1.1 from the ASOP repo.</p>
<p>No more Samsung control, fully legit Google phone and not a single network or hardware issue to date (save for me forgetting to flash the updated radio).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s patiently waiting for you to root your phone</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to root.</p>
<p>Just unlock the bootloader using fastboot, force load the yakju firmware so you are on the standard firmware, then relock bootloader.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>True&#8230; my reply was a knee jerk reaction to point out the proper state of a Nexus Phone&#8230; rooted</p>
<p>Agreed.  The phone is a developer phone that you can do whatever the hell you want with it.</p>
<p>If a carrier/Samsung is holding up the update and you have very easy tools to rectify the issue, the fault is also yours.</p>
<p>All you have to do is void the warranty! Easy peasy! Why would anyone be the least bit irked that a Nexus device isn&#8217;t getting updates when you could just void your warranty and fix the totally reasonable and fully justified lack of updates?</p>
<p>Re-lock the bootloader like Google suggests. Suddenly warranty!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going through the certification process now. And then it will come straight from Google. If you&#8217;re overly anxious, you can pull it off Google&#8217;s servers now, but you need to be rooted and have a way to flash a ROM.</p>
<p>Certification process = waiting for the customers&#8217; 2 year contract to be up so they give up and buy a newer model. Typical US wireless carrier.</p>
<p>I got an update to my GNex immediately after buying my device. I then got another update 6 months later. I&#8217;m slated to get another major update soon. All before my first year of owning this device. But according to your fuzzy math logic, 1 year = 2 years. Got it.</p>
<p>People that weren&#8217;t on Verizon got 5 or 6 updates in the same time period.</p>
<p>And some of them updates were very broken. That&#8217;s why there were 5 or 6 updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure there was nothing broken, but if you say so.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t you been reading the thread? That&#8217;s why people are arguing with me. They&#8217;re telling me we have incremental updates because something&#8217;s buggy or broken. Oh, I get it. When iOS has a X.&#215;.x update, something&#8217;s broken. But when Google does an X.&#215;.x update, everything is working fine. Which is it? Some people are saying one thing; others are saying something totally different.</p>
<p>Stuff was broken. Head over to XDA and read about it. They fixed &#8216;em. Sent out yet another incremental update. But hey, don&#8217;t take my word for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s a mix of both for both Operating systems. Like every OS ever?</p>
<p>How can you own an Android and NOT know it&#8217;s going to have some bugs. My Evo and Thunderbolt, while older devices, had their fair share.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s Google or HTC&#8217;s fault there, at the end of the day <em>I</em> have to deal with it and it wasn&#8217;t fun. It makes Android look bad.</p>
<p>Who said Google&#8217;s .&#215;.x incrementals are just fine? 4.0.3 and 4.0.4 were the two big fixer updates, resolving mostly radio issues. It was in the the changelog. Even Google themselves told manufacturers tht 4.0.3 would be the new base version of ICS, because of the bugs the existed prior to 4.0.3. iOS is no different. The change log even will say bug fixes or stability improvements. No software is 100% perfect. .&#215;.x are always, if not most of the time, bug fixers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running the leaked test build and everything is great so far.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s getting certified now. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll see it soon on our devices. Hopefully. If it&#8217;s as solid as you&#8217;re saying, it shouldn&#8217;t be that much longer.</p>
<p>When you say project butter wasn&#8217;t apparent, is it because the S III was fast enough before, or TouchWiz is still a drag?</p>
<p>I would wager so, Kellex from Droid Life said a little while back that ICS on the GSIII still seemed quicker to him than JB on the GN, likely because of the processor/GPU.</p>
<p>would wager the former*</p>
<p>something i would like to know myself.</p>
<p>the difference between 4.0.4 and 4.1 on my gnex was quite prominent. Hoping for the same kinda thing with the SG3.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell just by watching the video, but my gnex seems smoother than what they show here. I want to add that Project Butter isn&#8217;t so much about speed as it is about smoothness. It will feel faster as a result, but really isn&#8217;t, it just animated much smoother. Unless Samsung had already done some of the stuff that Google added with project butter (which I doubt), I think it should still benefit a lot from the experience, but it looked to me like there was more stutter in the home screen switching than I have on my gnex. That said, that may be because of the samsung widgets on the home screens. They are notorious for killing performance.</p>
<p>Still, this is all tiny differences. The device was great already. And perhaps it got better. On the Gnex the difference was quite huge, but it makes sense that an already fast device would benefit less from the changes. I just hope that touchwiz doesn&#8217;t kill the improvement of project butter.</p>
<p>I was kinda let down that they could not notice any speed or smoothness improvement because TouchWiz. I hope this is not the case and they will make a side by side comparison at high speed camera showing otherwise. Perhaps youtube will be my answer. If indeed, there is no UI smoothness or improvement compared to ICS, this will be a to reason at least for me to go with a unofficial rom.</p>
<p>Which ever way you look at it, the Samsung GS3 is simply the best phone in the market. Unless the iPhone 5 and Nokia comes up with something radical, only the Galaxy note 2 could beat it.</p>
<blockquote>Which ever way you look at it, the Samsung GS3 is simply the best phone in the market.</blockquote>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>I think you meant &#8220;QFT&#8221;.  <del>.</del></p>
<p>Quantum field theory????</p>
<p>Not for long,,,  920 is coming!</p>
<p>LOL. Hilarious. You have no idea how good the 920 is and you&#8217;re already throwing it up there against the best. Remember the woeful 900? Gimped from the start. Don&#8217;t think that&#8217;ll happen to WP8, but it&#8217;s better to wait for the device to actually release before pitting up against ones that currently are on the market.</p>
<p>I think most people already have a sense of what the 920 will be. Picture the WP8 hardware specs and the Samsung Ativ S (what a terrible name) for a bench mark, throw in the design of the n9, 800, 900, a 4.5&quot; 720 screen (thank god it isn&#8217;t 4.7 or 4.8), exclusive lumia apps&#8230;</p>
<p>And pureview</p>
<p>Just pureview alone for most people is a selling point. But even if that still isn&#8217;t reasonable, it&#8217;s no different than people saying &#8216;this is my next&#8217; about the iphone5 before they&#8217;ve even seen it. And yes, people do that, and they do it a lot.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a nice fantasy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Nokia though. So expect middle of the road specs at a premium price.</p>
<p>Also, given the dimensions of the phone, expect a 12 megapixel sensor. Nokia will ride its own marketing tailcoat though and have the audacity to call it <em>PureView</em></p>
<p><img src="http://gifsoup.com/view3/3901895/for-online-trolls-o.gif" /></p>
<p>Too bad it will already be a generation behind by the time it launches. S4 Pro and Exynos 5 Dual are coming out by the end of the year. I doubt Nokia&#8217;s phone will be released by November or December. They are just announcing it now because they&#8217;re hoping to disrupt the Apple event, which is kind of lame.</p>
<p>&#8230;unless you don&#8217;t like Pentile, AMOLED, phones larger than 4.3&quot;, and want build quality better than plastic everywhere.  Aside from that, if aesthetics are of no concern, the GS3 is in the top few phones, yes.</p>
<p>Build quality =/= material.</p>
<p>The phone is made of plastic and the build quality is excellent.</p>
<p>The back is creaky on handsets I&#8217;ve played with, and taking the back off a few times in order to pull the battery while ROMing it the one I had developed a gap on the bottom right corner that I could get a nail into when it was clipped down.  It just doesn&#8217;t have the premium feel of an iPhone, or even the One X or Lumia 900 or even Titan II.</p>
<p>And I REALLY don&#8217;t like the size.  I hate having to shuffle the phone around my palm to interact with the home button and notification shade; I want to be able to hold it securely and reach all over one handed.</p>
<blockquote> I want to be able to hold it securely and reach all over one handed.</blockquote>
<p>Twss. </p>
<p>The new iPhone will beat it for several reasons:</p>
<p>Hardware wise, I&#8217;m fairly sure it will have an underclocked A5X so dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU found in the new iPad 3. LTE is coming, that&#8217;s practically a given since the iPad has it and I doubt it&#8217;s a matter of battery life any longer. Fairly sure it&#8217;ll get a bump in RAM to 1GB from 512MB. Then you have the larger screen size and resolution to boot. I&#8217;m sure the battery will be larger slightly (removed 20pin connector space) but probably same battery life with the screen size and LTE aboard.</p>
<p>Software wise, iOS 6 is going to add a lot of neat features such as 3D maps and fly-over turn by turn navigation. Yes, I know Google had has navi, but they have not had 3D maps. Siri will get more functionality as well. Bluetooth 4.0 with MAP support will be neat (MetaWatch!) and Passbook could finally unify the thousands of applications each vendor (Starbucks, etc) has. The added Privacy &amp; Do Not Disturb settings are kind of nice as well.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the GS3 is still an Android phone. I don&#8217;t see what is so amazing about it, and it&#8217;s not much a looker to me. Okay it&#8217;s thin, but it&#8217;s also fat. I don&#8217;t have a purse and I don&#8217;t have huge pockets, so I like a  phone that&#8217;s thicker but not as wide/long. The App offerings on Android have always been the Achilles heel in my opinion.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that for the cpu we&#8217;re looking at a souped A5 rather than a weakened A5X. There&#8217;s a lengthy article on Anandtech about it.</p>
<blockquote>Hardware wise, I’m fairly sure it will have an underclocked A5X so dual-core CPU and quad-core GPU found in the new iPad 3. LTE is coming, that’s practically a given since the iPad has it and I doubt it’s a matter of battery life any longer.</blockquote>
<p>The Exynos quad and S4 Snapdragons are both beasts in their own right. And as mentioned Apple is more likely to go the other direction. And the S3 already has LTE. So what about the iPhone 5 beats the S3 here?</p>
<blockquote>Fairly sure it’ll get a bump in RAM to 1GB from 512MB. Then you have the larger screen size and resolution to boot.</blockquote>
<p>The S3 in the US has 2GB of RAM, the Exynos models primarily have 1GB. The S3&#8217;s resolution and screen size are both bigger than the iPhone 5 as well. Still waiting for a win.</p>
<blockquote>I’m sure the battery will be larger slightly (removed 20pin connector space) but probably same battery life with the screen size and LTE aboard.</blockquote>
<p>The battery life won&#8217;t be the same as previous iPhones with LTE aboard. But I think iOS is still more battery efficient than Jelly Bean so there might be a win here.</p>
<blockquote>Software wise, iOS 6 is going to add a lot of neat features such as 3D maps and fly-over turn by turn navigation. Yes, I know Google had has navi, but they have not had 3D maps.</blockquote>
<p>Except they do have 3D maps.</p>
<blockquote>Siri will get more functionality as well. Bluetooth 4.0 with MAP support will be neat (MetaWatch!) and Passbook could finally unify the thousands of applications each vendor (Starbucks, etc) has. The added Privacy &amp; Do Not Disturb settings are kind of nice as well.</blockquote>
<p>Guess what else has Bluetooth 4.0 &#8211; Passbook would be amazing if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact both Microsoft and Google will have the functionality duplicated shortly. DnD was awesome a decade ago on my featurephone.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the iPhone 5 is still a narrow iOS phone. The S3 does not require large pockets.</p>
<p>I always thought the S3 was fast enough without Project Butter.  It&#8217;s great that it exists, because it really helps the GNex out.  However the S3 doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;d benefit from it THAT much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still jittery on scrolling.  It&#8217;s a lot less, yes, but if you use an iPhone as your daily driver and pick one up it&#8217;s immediately apparent scrolling around the home screens.</p>
<p>No jitter at all on the international S3, you must have picked up one of those shoddy American ones.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funny is turning of all animations on the S3 and comparing the speed to the 4S. Apple disguises their phone&#8217;s lack of speed with slow transitions.</p>
<p>If you say so.  I&#8217;ve been hearing &#8220;it&#8217;s just as good now!&#8221; since Cupcake, but I&#8217;ll reserve judgement until I can hands-on one.</p>
<p>I have zero jitters or lag on my i9300 (forget those US models), unless I turn on the Power Saving option to slow down the CPU.  I&#8217;ve used an iPhone for 4 years and honestly can&#8217;t tell much of a difference between the two.  Before with my GNex, I sure could as far as the 4S and iOS 5 went.  But once it got JB, they were both silky smooth.  The S3 has always been that way for me too.</p>
<p>But now there is an iPhone 5, and it will throw a wrench into all of my plans once again.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think project butter affects manufacturer&#8217;s ROMs that much. Project butter is mainly a refinement to scrolling and the smoothness of Android core/Google Apps. Manufacturer (especially Samsung) have always made their own scrolling &#8216;refinement&#8217; (often less fine than stock, though) and most of the Android core apps are ditched anyways.</p>
<p>All in all I don&#8217;t really see how 4.1 is of any interest for the S3. It was a refinement update. TouchWiz is their &#8216;refinement&#8217;. Probably the only difference is Google Now.</p>
<p>I suggest you watch some Google I/O videos on how exactly Project Butter is implemented and how exactly it changes things. Because from your comment it is clear that you have absolutely no clue about it. Project Butter affects <strong>all</strong> apps, not just Google apps, and the changes it makes are embedded so deeply into the core of the UI rendering that every device coming from ICS to JB (unless the OEM rips this specific code out) will benefit.</p>
<p>Yes, Project Butter affects the smoothness of the S3, and yes, on Jelly Bean leaks I have run on my (international) S3 the difference is clearly noticable.</p>
<blockquote>Because from your comment it is clear that you have absolutely no clue about it.</blockquote>
<p>Oh I see. I have watched the complete presentation of Jelly Bean live in June and had it on my Nexus two or three days after. I know how it works pretty well. Project Butter was mainly about the anticipation of swiping movements, the vsync and tripple buffering and the general reduction of lags including that neat dev tool that showed fps dependent on system events. And from day one I could see and feel the differences (and the lack of). But for example, scrolling on a S2 or S3 never felt like scrolling in stock 2.3 respectively 4.0. That&#8217;s what I said. They make their own thing.</p>
<blockquote>unless the OEM rips this specific code out</blockquote>
<p>Especially Samsung has done that ever since.</p>
<p>Now please stop being so butthurt and prejudgemental because I assumed something you didn&#8217;t want to hear. I clearly phrased all that as (valid, btw) assumptions. If your research result differs, say it like an adult. Well I have the leaked JB rom on my S3 and in fact it does seem to have an effect. Very hard wasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>So as expected Samsung touchwhizzed all the Jellybean out of Jellybean.</p>
<p>So what about the SII?</p>
<p>Last development I heard &#8216;round the net is it&#8217;s still in &#8220;heavy testing&#8221; phases, striving for an October/November release.</p>
<p>Now that the GT-i9305 is in the wild, as seen in your video above, can you do me a favor and check how much RAM is in that thing? My source tells me the EU LTE GS3 has 2 GB of RAM. Oh and about the LTE, it should be dualband 800/2600 MHz. Can you confirm that too?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I think the EU LTE GS3 has the Quad-Core chip with 2GB of RAM. Similar to the Korean one.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I think as well. Dante is at the event though, so he can get confirmation from a Samsung/Vodafone employee. And as far as I know, South Korea uses 1800 MHz for LTE. Europe, right now, uses 2600 MHz, with 800 MHz deploying in several places.</p>
<p>Some parts of Europe, including Germany and the UK are using 1800Mhz for LTE. The One XL supports it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the market for a new phone since my contract is up. I&#8217;ve been looking at the s3 but I kind of want to see if there is going to be a new model of the Nexus since I&#8217;d rather have stock android.</p>
<p>Haha, Touchwiz cancels out Project Butter!</p>
<p>Yup, that&#8217;s why we have custom roms and kernels.</p>
<p>Arguably, TouchWiz was already as fast as Project Butter anyway.</p>
<p>No, the phone is just on a fast chip. TouchWiz is heavy.</p>
<p>I agree with this. TouchWiz on my GT10.1 is super duper laggy. Nothing about it is buttery. TouchWiz is the bane of Android.</p>
<p>Not to mention it uglifies it, too.  The hideous iOS-wannabe icons and twlauncher need to go.  The rest of TouchWiz can stay, if it must.</p>
<p>The built-in AOSP launcher has come a long way, and it bugs me to see something that looks like it still belongs on Android 2.x</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s hand is that in the picture? Is it Andre the Giant? The phone looks small in those hands!!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s honestly not that big.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not what she said.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to try out Now, if only for a few minutes before it gets old.</p>
<p>Google needed controlled circumstances, a before and after device,  and high speed cameras to showcase project butter on a device not running the best specs.  And I am supposed to believe on the accepted fastest, best performance android device, in a poorly lit conference hall, the discernment of project butter is obvious without a comparison device?</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s not focus on the fact Samsung has once again added TouchWiz to an android update before Google gets the vanilla update to all the Nexus owners that were promised fast updates.  Let&#8217;s focus on the fact that the fastest phone on the market, with zero performance complaints or issues isn&#8217;t faster with an incomplete update.</p>
<p>It was less of a critique and more of a bummer that even given all the accolades you gave the GS3 the performance boost wasn&#8217;t appreciably more so noticeable on the obviously better hardware</p>
<p>Except Jelly Bean hasn&#8217;t even officially hit the international Galaxy S3 yet, and when it finally does land, god knows how long it will take to get put on the American versions. Especially Verizon and Sprint variants.</p>
<p>Nice, black GS3</p>
<p>Yup, that&#8217;s much nicer then the white one I have.</p>
<p>Every Samsung phone should come with a &#8216;De-wiz&#8217; button&#8230; and as the UI melts off the screen to reveal vanilla Android it should scream &#8217;I&#8217;m melting!&#8217;</p>
<p>That.</p>
<p>Would be beautiful.</p>
<p>The videos don&#8217;t work in the Verge app anymore (iOS). Anyone having the same issue?</p>
<p>Same on Android despite having flash&#8230; Makes no sense.</p>
<p>The state of samsung&#8217;s android fills me with laughter. SLaughter?</p>

<p>This is pretty sweet. Couple of bugs but nothing terminal.</p>
<p>man, that&#8217;s the price of LTE right there:(</p>
<p>Care to elaborate? I really want to understand this comment but I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I think he may have meant to reply to a different person because his comment makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>i have the i747 US varient, (for the LTE) which gets much less attention than his international brother.</p>
<p>I just want the sources for CM10 to become PERFECT. Come on samsung UNLEASH THE SOURCES!!</p>
<p>I just checked it out myself. Vodafone also shows the Galaxy Note 2 LTE there. Unlike Samung themselves. But the bloggers there only cared about the GS3 LTE. BTW T-Mobile (DT) are also showing the GS3 LTE there and when I played around with it it actually had a fast 4G connection.</p>
<p>The video does not want to play via the app, iOS.</p>
<p>Past: Buy a Nexus.<br />
Now: Buy an unlocked Nexus.<br />
Future: &#8230;.?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s an unlocked Nexus?</p>
<p>I just hope for the love of God that Android 4.1 doesn&#8217;t hit the Galaxy S III before Sprint gets its act together and gets it onto the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised jellybean runs good on it the i9305 2 gig international version with quad core lte so us with 1 gig will always have a slow quad core phone thanks Samsung you realy shafted us there</p>
<p>You shafted yourself by jumping into the 1st phone you wanted.</p>
<p>After 5 years of a constant cycle with mobile phones. The contants iterations of each device being updated shortly after the intiial release. If you failed to see this happening.</p>
<p>You need a cognitive check. In the world of windows PC and android. There is ALWAYS something better around the corner. And always the first phone released is the stepping stone to whats coming.</p>
<p>Your failure to understand this is not samsungs. Matter of fact they bank of people like you that have no patience or understanding of how the game is played.</p>
<p>A quad core 1gb WAS NEVER MEANT to be the top just like the 2gb versions fate and so on. Welcome to technology sir.</p>
<p>What. </p>
<p>The reason Jelly Bean isn&#8217;t as noticeable on the SGS3 as it is on the Nexus is because the SGS3 is so damn fast to begin with. Touchwiz is needed because of all the Great software features it brings. Jelly Bean is the nuts on this beast of a phone. If the writer doesn&#8217;t see this then go back to your Apple 4 with the 3.5 inch screen and that great map experience. Not me, I gave my 4s away and never looked back. Thanks Samsung for great innovation. The SGS3 is the best phone in the world. That Note 2 looks pretty damn good. Keep them coming Samsung, love it.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>How does Google Now work with a physical home button? How can you open it NOT using the lock screen?</p>
<p>Holding down the (capacitive) menu button works as search for me.</p>
<p>And lent&#8217;s not forget the search bar, even if it requires you to be on the home screen.</p>
<p>Pebble Blue is the<em> best </em>color.</p>
<p>For all the talk of the SG3&#8217;s apparent superiority over all other Android handsets, my HTC One S looks a lot slicker and lag free if that video is anything to go by.</p>
<p>Flash video? Really?</p>
<p>I thought Jelly Bean is as smooth as iOS but from what I&#8217;ve just saw, what the hell is going on? It&#8217;s not as good as I thought it would be. Besides, why they still copy Apple&#8217;s iOS home screen interface? The icon is the same, page indication dot is the same as iOS.. what the hell is wrong with you Samsung??</p>
<p>That better be sarcastic. There was no stuttering anywhere. Every animation was smooth. The home screens have widgets on them and page indication dot elongates not gets bigger as with iOS. If you&#8217;re confusing a widget filled home screen with a grid of uniform square with rounded corner icons, then you need some glasses.</p>
<p>Why is it that the phone icon is the same picture as the one in iOS? It&#8217;s the same goddamn phone picture in green background. I guess it&#8217;s you who need a pair of glasses.</p>
<p>I am sick of half baked stuff, I wish everyone took a break for a year and come back with a resolved hardware and software&#8230; I like how Apple is not releasing half baked products, betas are bearable, but I am excited to see new iMacs, Mac Pros, iPhone etc&#8230;</p>
<p>S3? Fully baked.<br />
One X? Fully baked.<br />
Nexus 7? Baked to perfection.</p>
<p>Iphone 4= could not make phone call if you hold it wrong, hardware is fragile<br />
Iphone 4s= bad battery and siri is beta still..</p>
<p>You saw that SGS3 vs iPhone 4S drop test right? :)</p>
<p>My wife dropped her 4-day old GS3 from approximately 3 feet high.  The top right corner got two scratches (assuming that&#8217;s where it landed on the concrete).</p>
<p>It still works (thankfully).  I think those drop tests are highly suspect (either way they go) as you can not guarantee both phones will be dropped the exact same way and land the exact same way.</p>
<p>Luck has the most factor in whether or not your dropped phone will suffer major/minor damage.</p>
<p>anyone dump the rom?</p>
<p>So now we are arguing about updates now? Petty stuff, damn &#8211; it is a damn phone.</p>
<p>FUCK TOUCH WIZ</p>
<p>An Android phone running the latest version of Android? Wow!! Exciting news for fandroids!</p>
<p>android is looking more and more like WP without segoi ui</p>
<p>I dont understand how Samsung selled this Phone so much</p>
<p>It&#8217;s PATENTly obvious!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I hate about Samsung. When I updated my sister&#8217;s GS2 to ICS I didn&#8217;t feel any bloody difference apart from the lock screen and multi-tasking&#8230;the device is not even faster. N0 new icons, no new wallpapers, no updated camera UI, no new applications, no Halo UI. And the worst part is, the SGS2 ICS update just became available in the MENA region this month. The same scenario goes here; basically nothing is new apart from Google Now and the Notifications bar. Even project butter is somehow overshadowed like hardware acceleration in the SGS2 update that is supposed to make your phone faster&#8230;</p>
<p>My Xperia Arc and my mum&#8217;s Razr had a MUCH better ICS update that made us feel like we got totally new phones and I think Sony/Moto will do the same with the JB update to their devices.</p>
<p>That sounds backwards to me. Cripple (or fail to finish) launch software so you can show your customers you value them with a decent update later vs optimize for the best performance out of the box. I prefer a fully baked product vs a rushed half baked product fixed later.  You can only do so much with a software update. My GS II isn&#8217;t faster with ICS either.  But at release it was a performance behemoth, best in class, way ahead of everyone else.  So, when it the performance stayed the same and I got more features than I had before I counted that as a plus, not like every iOS upgrade that gives you some features (not the one you wanted though) with overall sluggish performance.</p>
<p>Why Android updates go through carriers?</p>
<p>Samsung, how can we said this, Jelly Bean + TouchWiz sucks a lot. Sorry, I&#8217;m in love with my Galaxy Nexus :P</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently using a GS3 on AT&amp;T as my daily driver. TouchWiz sucks. Its like iOS for the android crowd only it&#8217;s not nearly as user friendly or intuitive.  It actively tries to ruin the Android experience. Oh, and for the poster above who said TouchWiz was needed because of all the great apps it added, I want some of what you are smoking. All the Samsung apps are pretty awful.</p>
<p>As soon as the new Nexus Phones are announced this thing is going up on eBay.</p>
<p>This is the way it should be. Fast updates and upgrades for newer Android Versions. I hope the other companies learn from Samsung and begin to publish Android updates and upgrades more often.  <br />

<p>Samsung should just bloody retroactively turn the Galaxy S into a stock Android device, and give it a update. People still buy these in some countries, and now the spec difference is wide enough it won&#8217;t hurt sales of higher end devices. Win-Win.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know man.. I&#8217;ve been using the Galaxy S since 2 years and I&#8217;m happy that it has such an active dev community and support. It is the only phone after the HD2 which refuses to die. I am currently running a JB build and there are amazing improvements happening to it everyday. I&#8217;m pretty sure with some kernel tweaks the phone can run JB absolutely fine..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with this guy. Had my SGS since day 1 and running the latest JB roms on it just fine. I&#8217;m about ready to upgrade b/c I&#8217;d like HSPA+ and front facing camera and more RAM, but probably just be moving to the Nexus because the price is great and judging by JB performance on a SGS the Nexus should be plenty of power to handle stock ROM. No need for all the one x/SGS3 extra power if you don&#8217;t have their software loaded on top of stock.</p>

<p>IMM76D, not IMM74D.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s my exact model, and no update even after hitting &#8220;Check now&#8221;. Same thing happened with ICS, my mum (with the exact same phone) got the update right away, I waited in agony for a day, cracked, then did a reset to factory settings and then it got it. Hopefully I won&#8217;t have to resort to that this time.</p>
<p>GT-I9023 and GT-I9020 are essentially the same phone just with a different type of screen.</p>
<p>And different radios. Which is a pretty big difference.</p>
<p>Insanity. &#8216;Some&#8217; Nexus S variants. I want to love you Android but holy hell.</p>
<p>Like all iphones are the same? I mean&#8230; Verizon, AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>They certainly get updated at the same time.</p>
<p>If the US carriers could get their act in gear, that sort of thing wouldn&#8217;t happen so often.  People often say that it&#8217;s impossible to converge on a wireless standard because the US is so big, but Europe is just as large, twice as populated, and has had interoperable phones for decades.</p>
<p>Sort yourselves out, US carriers.</p>
<p>The Nexus S 4G is CDMA, and needs a separate update which comes after the GSM variant.</p>
<p>Anyone aware of a CWM flashable zip of the bone stock version for i9020T?</p>

<p>There you go but you may lose your recovery in the process. There are some work arounds, you&#8217;ll have to go through the thread.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll check it out, thanks. Would recommend, but app.</p>
<p>The trick to this is, flash Superuser as normal, install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager&hl=en" target="new">Rom Manager</a> and re install CWM from there it will automatically ask you if to move it so you can reboot without loosing your recovery.</p>
<p>Rebooting to Jelly Bean right now on Nexus S 9020T&#8230;For the impatient once like me&#8230;Go to: Settings&#8594;Apps&#8594;All&#8594;Google Service Framework&#8594;Clean cache/data<br />
Then go and search for new updates in Settings&#8594;About&#8594;System Updates<br />
Try this a couple of times and Jelly Bean is yours&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Try this a couple of times&#8221; </blockquote>
<p>What is &#8220;this&#8221;? Removing the cache and data? Or checking for updates? Because when I wiped the data and cache and there was no update I couldn&#8217;t wipe any more cache or data simply because there was none&#8230;</p>
<p>by &#8220;this&#8221; I mean do the procedure of clearing the data AND and then search for new updates. It worked a couple of times. I found this procedure in different forums and it works at some time, if the update is available for your device</p>
<p>did this work for you? I&#8217;ve been doing this for days now but no luck yet&#8230;.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got the order a bit wrong actually. First PULL THE SIM CARD. For me it didnt work until I did this. Go into apps then google services framework, CLEAR THE CACHE, KILL THE APP, then go search for updates.</p>
<p>I would also advise any would be updaters to check beforehand that they&#8217;re running the i9020/i9020t and already on the latest firmware&#8230;I can&#8217;t remember off the top of my head, but frankly, it&#8217;s only five minutes of googling.</p>
<p>using the t version right now time to start hitting update&#8230;. update&#8230;.. update.</p>

<p>i recieved an ota update for my nexus s , when i had my JB on my phone, i cannot open my gallery and camera, my phone is not rooted what should i do</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait until we get 4.2, mmm. Love CM10, actually need to update my monthly build later today.</p>
<p>What are they gonna call that anyway? CM11? Or CM10.1</p>
<p>10.1 I think, because it&#8217;s still Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing just CM10</p>
<p>10.1. The current is 10.0.0</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#Usage_share_of_Android_versions" target="new">API Level 16</a> is the 10th official release, and it encompasses Jelly Bean 4.1-4.2</p>
<p>(my EVO is on CM7.2.0 but it&#8217;s Android 2.3.7)</p>
<p>I thought Jelly Bean MR1 4.2 was API level 17.</p>
<p>My G1, from 2008, mind you &#8211; is on ICS right now, CM10.</p>
<p>Even TheVerge wrote an article about it &#8211; shame on TV for not mentioning this feat by these awesome devs.</p>
<p>Damn, I don&#8217;t know how you can still use an ancient device like that, but props for sticking with it. How&#8217;s it handling ICS? (Did you mean CM9?)</p>
<p>Its still going to be 10. CM number goes up when Google changes name of version.</p>
<p>It will remain CM10 most likely. It&#8217;s not a major charnge only a moderate updaye from 4.1</p>
<p>They&#8217;re quoted as saying CM10.1 on their G+ page. <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117962666888533781522/posts/1FLFe2RzYZ7">In the edit at the bottom.</a></p>
<p>No Nexus S? I don&#8217;t see it there.</p>
<p>its noted as &#8220;crespo&#8221;</p>
<p>Still not in the 10 release list. 9 is the latest stable build listed for the NS.</p>
<p>oh sorry i misunderstood</p>
<p>That is really weird, I&#8217;m running the stable Cyanogenmod 10 on an Galaxy S, which is essentially the same phone. I guess they didn&#8217;t bother porting it, since Google updated Nexus S to Jelly Bean themselves.</p>
<p>of course they ported it, and it&#8217;s probably just as stable, no idea why they haven&#8217;t yet uploaded it though&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably just not uploaded yet. CM doesn&#8217;t not release builds for phones if they were updated officially.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Well that probably explains why Nexus 7 and galaxy nexus is supported. <del>.</del></p>
<p>I really dislike the fact they always go by the internal device name rather than the actual name of the phone.</p>
<p>It helps people in different markets than the US. For example the Galaxy Nexus has several different versions, maguro being the international one.</p>
<p>toro is the Verizon version.</p>
<p>Even both being branded &#8220;Samsung Galaxy Nexus&#8221; they have different hardware and need Android that&#8217;s built specifically for that hardware, which is why they use the codename.</p>
<p>All of the code uses the codenames, so that is the &#8216;real&#8217; name to these devs. Personally, I think its a nice geeky touch.</p>
<p>Exactly, I prefer calling my HTC Incredible S a Vivo because it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m used to typing. Building custom ROM&#8217;s really gets you used to the devices codename.</p>
<p>I wish people did that on XDA with the One X. I have the Endeavor (not the AT&amp;T model which is called Evita). It makes it a hit or miss with accessories.</p>
<p>Nexus S runs CM10 really badly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running AOKP on mine without any trouble except google now loads slowly the first time.</p>
<p>Probably still better than 9/4.0 though.</p>
<p>Hmm, my girlfriend&#8217;s Galaxy S runs it quite well (scrolling in browser, apps, play store is smoother than it ever was on the stock roms &#8211; only loading times may be a <em>little</em> higher sometimes).. so the Nexus S should perform quite similar, if not better.</p>
<p>Seems like Google will stop supporting it also</p>
<p>It takes time for there systems to build them all, give it a few days. Crespo4g here.</p>
<p>Yep, I&#8217;ve been using CM10 on my phone for quite a while now, good stuff. Looking forward to 4.2</p>
<p>Yeah me too I usually find nightlies stable enough that I don&#8217;t really care much about stables, especially when 4.2 will probably be out so soon.</p>
<p>HP Touchpad got CM10 betas about a week ago. It&#8217;s so smooth.</p>
<p>That $99 finally paid off.</p>
<p>Are they up to betas with CM10 now? I&#8217;ve been holding off and am still on CM9 alpha2 or whatever the last pre-nightlie release was.</p>
<p>You should flash the nightlies. If i recall correctly even the main-dev told &#8220;us&#8221; to! ;)<br />
But i didn&#8217;t stumble over CM10 for the TouchPad until now.. at least not on get.cm ?</p>
<p>I guess technically it&#8217;s called a &#8220;Preview,&#8221; but everything works flawlessly (except the pretty useless front-camera)</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1811480" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1811480</a></p>
<p>The only thing is it is highly recommended to use ACMEInstaller(3) to install it since simply flashing it from CWM wont resize your partitions adequately.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been holding off on CM10 in case things like netflix and certain games weren&#8217;t working properly. Everything works flawlessly? Is it as functional as CM9?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t have Netflix but several people in the thread report that it works fine.</p>
<p>I myself have been playing 720p movies on it fine. It&#8217;s just as functional as CM9 in that regard.</p>
<p>You really should be using the nightlies. Alpha2 is very old at this point and so much has been fixed and added in the nightlies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been very pleased with the CM9 nightlies, but I&#8217;ll have to give CM10 a try now. These devs are amazing</p>

<p>I actually LOL&#8217;d. Nice.</p>
<p>BELIEVE IT</p>
<p>8GB is still available</p>
<p>ya 8GB keeps disappearing/appearing for some reason.  16GB is most likely not going to be available again today.</p>
<p>It was for me&#8230; I just bought the 16GB version after playing mash the F5 key for about 10 min until I was able to add it to my cart.  Maybe the order will get cancelled, but I got a confirmation email and everything.</p>
<p>Sold out in UK in a few minutes&#8230; that was well over 10hrs ago now, still no article.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, some retailers also restricting their stock for contract only, not allowing sim-free sales, just yet</p>
<p>Also sold out in Canada.</p>
<p>O2 still has some in stock, so it isn&#8217;t sold out.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about Google Play&#8230; not tied to contracts</p>

<p>thanks, forgot this isn&#8217;t apple where a new article is needed for beta ios releases and i should know to refer back to older articles for android updates.</p>
<p>Yep&#8230;1 article for apple, with lots of articles extracted from it<br />
For android just the 1 article which receives small updates sometimes</p>
<p>I give mad props for what those guys do, but every flavor of CM I&#8217;ve tried is anything but stock Android&#8230; it has it&#8217;s own bloatware always in tow</p>
<p>Bloat? CM doesn&#8217;t even come with Google appsppre installed&#8230;.. What are you even saying.</p>
<p>Cm is the least bloated phone OS available PERIOD.. iOS, and WP are more bloated than CM..</p>
<p>Actually it&#8217;s SlimROMs.</p>
<p>It has a couple of CM apps like Apollo, File explorer, Theme engine, Trebuchet, etc. It&#8217;s AOSP based, not pure. Still awesome, though.</p>
<p>Apollo replaces the Music app, Trebuchet replaces Launcher2. File Manager and Theme Engine are incredibly lightweight, and also excellent at what they do. Just because the apps are made specifically for CM doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re &#8220;bloat&#8221;. Is the new Updater, that brings OTA functionality to all supported CM10+ devices, considered bloat, because it is a &#8220;CM app&#8221;?</p>
<p>Again, I said it&#8217;s not pure AOSP like the Super Nexus ROM for the GS3. Did not said it was bloat, just that it&#8217;s not the literal stock Android</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;.also confused by what you&#8217;re talking about. Other than a couple of extra menus and slight tweaks to default music and launcher apps&#8230;.what? It comes with no extra apps installed (except a 34k terminal emulator), and almost no changes to the stock ROM.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget File Manager, Updater, DSP Manager, Theme Manager, and Torch, which (combined with Apollo and Terminal Emulator) all together weigh in at a hefty <em>2.3 MB</em>.</p>
<p>Not to mention that with that handy File Manager, you could even delete those packages, and gain enough space for a single [short] song.</p>
<p>If 2.3 MB of useful extras could ever be considered bloat, then what word should we use for the dozens of MB wasted in manufacturers&#8217; Android distros?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using CM since it was a addon pack for JF&#8217;s rom on my G1.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using Jelly bean on my xperia ray thanks to CM and the FXP team.</p>
<p>On CM9.1 on a galaxy s2/i9100.  Waiting for release candidates to try CM10, but I would heartily recommend the mod for anybody who&#8217;s carrier or manufacturer is holding their phone back.</p>
<p>The RCs for CM10 were effectively the M-Snapshot releases, and the nightlies have been solid for months now (at least for AOSP devices, my crespo4g has been running CM10 since July).</p>
<p>I have been on Jelly Bean on my Infuse (an aries variant with a 4.5 inch screen). I runs AWESOME.<br />
GO try it!</p>
<p>I like to refer to my One X running CM10 as a One NeXus.  Sometimes I still bounce back to Sense for the camera stuff, but I always end up craving CM10.</p>
<p>Camera software is the only &#8220;bad&#8221; part of AOSP. Hopefully 4.2 will fix that. And hopefully Samsung will stop being a bitch and release the freaking documentation of the Exynos 4 so devs can make a real ROM.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mostly use the Sense camera for the Burst Mode and the slow motion video, which unfortunately use proprietary Sense functionality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the chipset. The quadcore One X is basically a 6-core phone if you count the idle and camera processors.</p>
<p>the new camera app is fantastic on my gnexus</p>
<p>Hmm. looks like it should be stable on an S3.  Anyone think the Droid DNA will have decent community support?  I am coming from a galaxy Nexus so this touch Wiz and Sense thing is awful to endure.</p>
<p>Touchwiz is not bad, IMO, specially if you change your launcher. Than it becomes a mix of the ICS/Jelly Bean style with some Gingerbread in apps like contacts and messages.</p>
<p>^ This is my experience. Tried running AOSP-based ROMs on my VZW S3, but always kept coming back to TW-based ones. My battery seems to last a fair bit longer on TW rather than AOSP. And I do have to plug Synergy&#8217;s JB build &#8211; it is pretty fantastic. Just waiting on JB kernals for that over-the-top polish!</p>
<p>Well, it looks there haven&#8217;t been any serious comments up to this point, so I&#8217;ll add mine.</p>
<p>CM10 is a great alternative for those brave and patient enough to tinker with a phone and void its warranty. Unfortunately this doesn&#8217;t work for 99% of people. Most people just want a great &#8220;out of the box&#8221; experience. I think it&#8217;s great The Verge is informing people of their options but people need to know how much work it is to install and maintain CM10, and that they could potentially brick their device.</p>
<p>Maintain? Yes, installation can be a tough proposition, especially for devices with complex unlocking procedures. But once it&#8217;s installed, maintainence isn&#8217;t really required. In fact, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s easier than most stock ROMs  (except Nexus devices), since CM10 now has a built-in OTA updater., and those updates don&#8217;t have to wait for any carrier approval. This actually makes maintenance a possibility, unlike carrier branded devices which just get left to rot with years-old software.</p>
<p>I think the last version I installed was CM7.1, so I didn&#8217;t know about the OTA updater. That&#8217;s pretty nice. I could see how that makes maintenance a breeze.</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve had multiple phones with cm installed on them go back to the manufacturer to repair. Never once have they had a problem with it.</p>
<p>Just for the record, while Cyanogenmod is fairly close to stock, it is nothing like stock Android.  Cyanogenmod is in fact a skinned version of Android with features that aren&#8217;t in stock Android, although the UI is about as close as you can get to stock.  Likewise, AKOP, Bugless Beast, MIUI, Paranoid Android and the like are all skins of Android.</p>
<p>Not all skins of Android are bad and these ROMs show how skinning can be tastefully done.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t discern the difference between CM and pure stock. Any &#8220;features&#8221; added can be turned on and off. Performance is identical as are All UI elements.</p>
<p>Yes, &#8220;skin&#8221; implies something looks different. CM10 looks and feels virtually identical to JB4.1. There are a couple extras (that can be turned off, try turning anything in Sense/Touchwiz/MotoBlur off), but they don&#8217;t change how the interface in general looks or acts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running Bugless Beast for a few months and I don&#8217;t know how you can call it a skin.  It&#8217;s visually indentical to stock Jellybean in every way.  There is nothing changed.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even know what skinned means.. Please stop trolling.. Skin means theme, font, menu look, launcher, icon and etc changes.. CM has a few small ADDITIONS made to it to cater to the dev crowd. Anyone who is not interested can easily just not use those options</p>
<p>CM actually has some additions (such as multiple user accounts) that are beneficial to non-developers as well.  If you look at some other ROMs, such as the popular MIUI and AKOP (which many Android nerds are moving over to) there are differences in the UI that aren&#8217;t quite within the stock Android standards.</p>
<p>Cyanogenmod also doesn&#8217;t do notification toggles like Google does in Android 4.2.  While Cyanogenmod is 98% of the way to stock Android, it still is a skin, and personally, I feel that Cyanogenmod works better for me than stock Android (I have a Galaxy Nexus).</p>
<p>Ugh, it&#8217;s AOKP, not AKOP. Sorry it really bugs me when it&#8217;s spelled wrong. :) It stands for Android Open Kang Project.</p>
<p>Someone flash this to a GS3 and give it to Josh<img src="http://i.imgur.com/UNig7.png" /></p>
<p>One X dude! He&#8217;s on ATT and doesn&#8217;t have to settle for an S3</p>
<p>Oh man, that means he has to jump through all those bootloader HBOOT hoops.</p>
<p>You unlock the bootloader, boot clockworkmod and flash SU, its the same as rooting a nexus with the added convolution (though no complication) of reading an email that HTC sends you within 10 minutes. Is the S3 much better?</p>
<p>I agree that the One X is a much better phone but I don&#8217;t see the One X listed as a supported device on get.cm just the international One XL and that doesn&#8217;t support AT&amp;T&#8217;s LTE bands.</p>

<p>I accidentally posted my response in the subject line.  The AT&amp;T One X is supported under codename Evita.  I&#8217;ve been running nightlies for a while and the latest stable release is fantastic.</p>
<p><a href="http://get.cm/?device=endeavoru&type=" target="_blank">http://get.cm/?device=endeavoru&amp;type=</a></p>
<p>One X is sup. There isn&#8217;t stable version available tho.</p>
<p>Good news!  Looks like 4.2 is headed to AOSP today, so hopefully it&#8217;ll get merged with CM10 soon:</p>
<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/android-building/-ymcoMuDAbA">https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/android-building/-ymcoMuDAbA</a></p>
<p>They&#8217;re going ahead with a stable release and kinda starting again with 4.2. They&#8217;re calling it CM10.1</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not too excited about 4.2 yet.  We don&#8217;t even have kernel source for 4.1.2 on Evita so we&#8217;re lacking vsync.</p>
<p>Has anyone used CM10 for the Transformer Prime? I probably won&#8217;t put this on my GS3 quite yet, as its performance is so very very excellent, but I&#8217;ve found my TF201 is stuttering and being all kinds of shitty lately.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s battery life? Haven&#8217;t really been following the progress.</p>
<p>on my gnexus, just a hair better than stock. the cpu regulator seems to work better on cm.</p>
<p>My mediocre at best Motorola Defy now has 4.1.2 and is clocked at 1.1Ghz, XDA is Android&#8217;s greatest ally.</p>
<p>Running Jellybean for some time now on my SGS II thanks to CyanogenMod. There are still few problems thanks to Samsung not releasing exynos source code. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, stock experience (plus few extra options) and higher android version is much better than what Samsung put in.</p>
<p>Perfect TIMING! Was just about to flash the M2 from last month last night. I am all over this.</p>
<p>Flashed CM10 M2 on my GS3 yesterday, loving it so far!!!! I recommend mods to disable the hardware buttons (optionally use home as camera button) and put onscreen keys as well, makes it almost like having a Galaxy Nexus 2. :) Completely loving Android again!</p>
<p>Love the CM Updater too, makes it so much easier!</p>
<p>If AT&amp;T doesn&#8217;t push the JB update to GS3 before then, I know what I&#8217;m doing next Friday.</p>
<p>Save yourself the wait time, and get a few features at the same time. Go ahead and flash.</p>
<p>Dock audio isn&#8217;t up to scratch. That&#8217;s a huge feature to me.</p>
<p>Just tell Josh about it!</p>
<p>No stable for the International S3 :(</p>
<p>This sucks.</p>
<p>Meh, AOKP is better.</p>
<p>Better at stealing&#8230;</p>
<p>Just did CM10 on my OneX, looks good so far.  Wasn&#8217;t aware that it was finally stable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all Nexus&#8217;ed up (Galaxy Nexus/Nexus 7) this time out, so I don&#8217;t use CM on my phone, but it absolutely saved my Droid 1 from being thrown out a window in frustration. The thing was practically useless near the end of its life on its stock ROM, but CM7 (at the time) made it feel new and useful again. I also have an HP Touchpad running CM9, that lives in my living room for communal use. They&#8217;ve just released a test version of CM10 for it. It&#8217;s a great tablet experience as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll use CM on every Non-Nexus Device I buy</p>
<p>My i717 (AT&amp;T Galaxy Note) is stuck on CM 9.1, and the most recent CM10 builds for this device are still a very long way from stable.  :(</p>
<p>It has snapdragon so nightly builds should be pretty stable by now. Remember that cm has tendency to run on betas very long to ensure everything&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>You guys think the DNA is gonna get official dev support? I wonder if the bootloader will even be unlockable. I think i might cry if I can&#8217;t get that phone.</p>
<p>Probably not since it&#8217;s on Verizon. If they release an international GSM version that should be supported.</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;ll wait and see whether to get this or the GSIII.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further, CyanogenMod can breath new life&#8221;<br />
Think you mean &#8220;breathe&#8221; new life</p>
<p>I use CM10 on my Verizon Gnex. While originally I did it to get JB before the update, I have stuck to it for the little extra features. Is that a wise course, since I am pretty sure the battery has taken a hit? Do you guys think I should switch to stock or is CM10 worth it?</p>
<p>Bonus question: I am fully capable of messing with my phone so if I was to stick with CM10 are there any good battery mods?</p>
<p>Also, I have a Touchpad running CM9 with the latest Nightly. Probably going CM10 in the next week or so.</p>
<p>I flashed CM10 on my Verizon Gnex after getting frustrated with the wait for JB. My first experience with flashing an alternate ROM. I ultimately reverted to stock due to the huge battery hit. I was typically burning through ~10-12%./hr with normal use. Stock puts me back around 6-8%/hr.</p>
<p>That is about what I am seeing. However the horrific update wait from VZ and extra customizability CM10 offers has kept me with CM.</p>
<p>Try a new kernel for better battery life. I use Franco&#8217;s kernel and it is much better. If you&#8217;re going to root and ROM look into kernels too. He even has one that offered an over clock to the GPU.</p>
<p>Thanks man!  I will check out said kernel.</p>
<p>Confused, people on XDA forums are saying that a stable version IS out for the GS2 Skyrocket, but the article here is saying otherwise&#8230;or am I reading it wrong?</p>
<p>The standard for &#8220;crafty&#8221; is slipping.</p>
<p>Running it on my HTC One X&#8230; no Wi-Fi or GSM butter &#8216;buttery&#8217; smooth!</p>
<p>Of course I&#8217;ll have to go back to a working ROM, but its just so fluid!</p>
<p>How good does it look on the X&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been visiting the XDA forums on the hour to check out the progress. Addictive indeed.</p>
<p>The screen and touch works.</p>
<p>Thats it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s interesting because I&#8217;m finding the screen transitions more stuttery on my One X than on the Nexus S it replaced (despite the increase in processor power).  I&#8217;m also finding the screen less responsive to touch than the Nexus S.</p>
<p>As a Nexus S user, me right now:</p>

<p>Love you, Google. ;)</p>
<p>Been using it on my Gnex since Thursday and love it. But still missing a few custom ROM features I take for granted so can&#8217;t wait for the devs to get on the case.</p>
<p>Support your devs, donate.</p>
<p>I do and have&#8230; But yes, so far I&#8217;m mostly in love. My biggest gripe is having to have the inputs in US english to get the &#8220;extra&#8221; search functionality and the predictive keyboard that isn&#8217;t very good at predicting anything yet&#8230; All else though I&#8217;m very happy with.</p>
<p>I wish they&#8217;d go and release a Google factory image for the Galaxy Nexus. I realize that Google has no reason to do so, but it&#8217;d be nice if I didn&#8217;t have to rely on a port.</p>
<p>What do you mean they have no reason to do so?? They will release the image once the OTA is out. That&#8217;s how they always do it.</p>
<p>All factory images are here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images</a></p>
<p>Or do you mean the 4.1 image? In that case jfedor is right, they&#8217;ll release it with the OTA. Technically the OTA that the people who attended I/O was a &#8220;developer preview&#8221; not a full release.</p>
<p>They do have a stock factory image for ICS on the Galaxy Nexus GSM. They made it clear that JB on the free GNexus devices they gave out at Google i/o was a developer rom and wasn&#8217;t the final version. When the OTA rolls out mid July expect a Jelly Bean factory image to become available.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I think you might have meant to say right on <strong>cue</strong>, not queue. (Unless there is a joke I&#8217;m missing!)</p>
<p>Personally, I am just waiting for a JB based CM for Kindle Fire&#8230; who needs new hardware!?</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 has already probably sold a lot more then the Kindle Fire already, bet ya that.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>People with Bluetooth headphones?</p>
<p>Now, when can we have the Jelly Bean source code?</p>
<p>Right now I feel a bit sorry for the CyanogenMod developers, having worked so hard to get CyanogenMod 9 release candidates out of the door they&#8217;ll be anticipating the Jelly Bean source release with some significant apprehension for it will surely be followed by hoards of users demanding CyanogenMod 10 right now or possibly yesterday.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;d be surprised if it was anything like as hard to adapt to as ICS was.</p>
<p>Yeah, there was a ton of change to work through in CM9 because it was so radically different from Gingerbread.  There are mostly cosmetic changes to work out in Jelly Bean, with the most significant changes being the Notification Area and Project Butter.</p>
<p>In any case, it definitely won&#8217;t take 9 months to get CM10 out the door.  Expect it by Christmas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d expect alpha/nightly builds within the month knowing those crazy cats.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a stupid question, but what do you do when you have to pull the battery (since the Nexus7&#8217;s is non-removable)?</p>
<p>All android devices with non-removable battery have a set of buttons/pinhole you can press to cause a hardware reset just like a battery pull.</p>
<p>Already rooted with CWM?</p>
<p>Looks like another device that I will receive and never boot in a &#8220;stock&#8221; state.  Hoorah!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how this is an &#8220;upgrade&#8221;. And Galaxy S2 is supposed to get Jelly Bean this month anyway &#8211; which it <strong>should</strong>. Samsung shouldn&#8217;t release the phone again just to put the new version on it, and make you buy it again.</p>
<p>Exactly. What&#8217;s the point if the original is getting Jelly Bean?</p>
<blockquote>and make you buy it again.</blockquote>
<p>You really think they plan to trick current owners into buying a second one? Most folks who would be looking to upgrade from an SGS2 right now would probably have more high-end taste anyway as they probably bought it some time ago (it was a flagship phone less than 12 months ago).<br />
Also, there may be some minor difference in the internals that would justify a distinction from the previous model.<br />
But the strategy here is obviously to draw attention from those who might pass on the 2 year old phone simply assuming it&#8217;s dated, previous packaging I&#8217;ve seen still marks it as a gingerbread phone.<br />
The SGS2 still holds up as a solid mid-to-low-range phone and this is just their way of letting shoppers know.<br />
I really don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s a scam&#8230; might not be newsworthy though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, there may be some minor difference in the internals that would justify a distinction from the previous model.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are right. You get 8GB of sotrage instead of 16GB. Hell of an upgrade right? What other internal change did you had in mind that would somehow make this &#8220;Plus-worthy&#8221;. All the important parts of the hardware are already known and it appears it&#8217;s a downgrade.</p>
<p>This feels very much like a scam to me. It&#8217;s the same phone with less sotrage and with a new OS update. You don&#8217;t call that the &#8220;Plus&#8221; version. You call that &#8220;The Galaxy SII with Jelly Bean&#8221;. Hell, you would just call that &#8220;The Galaxy SII 8GB&#8221;. The fact that it runes a 6 month old update shouldn&#8217;t initiate any rebranding.</p>
<p>How stupid is it that the Galaxy SII will be a better phone than the Galaxy SII Plus when it gets the promised OS update?</p>
<p>The &#8220;Plus&#8221; is there for a single reason. To make new and old customers believe that this version of the SII is sowhat better. It&#8217;s the same &#8220;+&#8221; HTC uses for their  improved handsets. It&#8217;s the &#8220;S&#8221; Apple uses to mark their improved devices. But only with Samsung they offer a device that is actually a worse device.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a scam. It&#8217;s there only to mislead customers. Simple as that.</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;All the important parts of the hardware are already known.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Is it Exynos, OMAP or Spandragon (and which version of each)? There have been variants of the S2 with any of the 3. And performance varied on many levels. Sometimes they carry different names or tags on the end, sometimes they don&#8217;t.<br />
All you know is clock speed, ram, and camera resolutions. There&#8217;s a little more to a phone than that.<br />
Interesting that you put the words  "Plus-worthy" in quotes when I didn&#8217;t say that. I just said it might be different enough to require a distinction of some sort.<br />
I get more annoyed when Samsung sells phones with significantly different internal hardware under the same name.<br />
My guess would be that this is the same old i9100 model. I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that big a deal.</p>
<p>yes, 8gb or storage, but support for 64Gb SD card would make max storage from 48Gb to 72Gb</p>
<p>Indeed. This device is everything that&#8217;s wrong with Android.</p>
<p>Actually No It Isn&#8217;t Atleast not the original International Version with the 4.3 inch screen, Only the Bigger US Version with a 4.52 inch screen is, Plus this version has a NFC chip, while the other doesn&#8217;t</p>
<p>The Galaxy S2 was supposed to get Jelly Bean in <strong>November</strong>.</p>
<p>No it does not. It downgrades the SII from 16gb to 8gb and adds JB 4.1.2 (which is due any time now for original SII) then calls it a &#8220;Plus&#8221; This in thee UK is called &#8220;Spin&#8221;</p>
<p>What does this have over the S3 mini?</p>
<p>SAMOLED Plus screen without PenTile on this one, higher megapixel cameras, and, um, that&#8217;s about it :P</p>
<p>The screen is also larger on the S2+ vs the S3M.  That can be a pro or a con, depending on whether you care more about pixel density or screen size.  IMHO, WVGA resolution is much too low for a 4.3&quot; screen &#8211; you need qHD at least, and even then you&#8217;re not at 300ppi.</p>
<p>This is definitely not the high-end &lt;4.5&quot; Android phone that a lot of people are waiting for.  Neither is the S3M.</p>
<p>Right. While Samsung removed the PenTile matrix on the S2, the bigger screen size meant that I could see pixels as well as I could seem them on my Galaxy S, so it kinda never impressed me (though I never used the phone more than 5 minutes). Guess they need to hit the right price point to justify a WVGA display here.</p>
<p>Wait, am I seeing things?<br />
There is actually a phone called &#8220;Samsung Galaxy S Two Plus&#8221;?</p>
<p>No wander they need to spend so much money on advertizing. Those names are getting rediculously long</p>
<p>Same as &#8220;Samsung Galaxy S Three Mini&#8221;, so yeah, seems to be a trend?</p>
<p>Just wait for the Samsung Galaxy S Three Mini Plus haha</p>
<p>and confusing&#8230;<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>Does this mean we get to call the iPhone 4s the iPhone Four Ess?</p>
<p>This is something Samsung has done in past and there is different strategy behind it.<br />
This would will remove any sign of the things that were involved in patent loss. It ditches the Exynos SOC in favour of a cheaper to make SOC from 3rd party so Samsung does not have to keep making outdated SoC and they can move focus to newer chips in factory.<br />
It is downgrade but it will also be available cheaper and will give an option to people who want relatively powerful phone for cheap. And it will be another phone that will compete in slightly lower price bracket and will probably end up eating sales of competitors. <br />
These are the things that has turned Samsung into a successful profitable outfit that nobody except Apple seems to be able to match.<br />
Its another option for people. They are not touching their high end offerings. But adding another option in the lower price point while cutting production cost as well.</p>
<p>We have a winner!</p>
<p>Samsung is a much better business than many enthusiasts give them credit for.</p>
<p>Finally Someone else who has common sense, I think I love you, In a Platonic way of course</p>
<p>Hmmm, the S3 Mini hasn&#8217;t come to India yet, but maybe this will. Samsung needs a competing product against Sony in the below $400 range, so could be a good one in that case.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably also a patent dodge.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because the S2 (or some variants of it) is the only phone still sold that Apple had patent claims against. If they can remove it from sale and replace it with one that has the S3&#8217;s software, Apple&#8217;s device-specific claims are basically redundant.</p>
<p>If you are referring to Apple patent claims on the US GS2 variants, this is probably not heading for the US.</p>
<p>I am, yes.</p>
<p>Actually Apple added the S3 and Galaxy Note 2 to it&#8217;s List so this might possibly be added to it&#8217;s list aswell</p>
<p>If this is sold at around $270 then I am buying it as my second phone!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t. Get the normal S2, it sells around $200 on eBay, and it&#8217;s a better phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/Cell-Phones-Smartphones-/9355/i.html?_sop=15&_from=R40&_nkw=i9100&rt=nc&LH_BIN=1" target="_blank">http://www.ebay.com/sch/Cell-Phones-Smartphones-/9355/i.html?<em>sop=15&amp;</em>from=R40&amp;<em>nkw=i9100&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH</em>BIN=1</a></p>
<p>Thanks! But the one which is selling for $200 is broken. Others are selling at around $300. I think I&#8217;ll wait for the cost of this one.</p>
<p>The title doesn&#8217;t really make sense, shouldn&#8217;t it be:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Samsung upgrades aging smartphone Galaxy SII Plus with Jelly Bean&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Nah, it should be</p>
<p>&#8220;Samsung slightly downgrades old flagship, making it slightly worse, but slaps a &#8216;Plus&#8217; suffix on it to deceive customers&#8221;</p>
<p>I have an S2 and it&#8217;s awesome, I love Android because it rocks, I tolerate Samsung because they make decent products, but this is a flat-out scam. You cannot just call something X PLUS while it&#8217;s worse that product X.</p>
<p>They did this Plus-thing before (Ace plus, SGS Plus,&#8230;) but those were all slight upgrades, so the plus was justified.</p>
<p>They only downgraded slight things which were already ridiculously good even in todays Android Market, Like the 16GB of Storage plus a SD card slot, but they upgraded the OS out of the box and are selling it for less in the first place so a Jelly Bean Low-Mid Range phone out of the box is way more that fantastic</p>
<p>Yeah the headline as written makes little to no sense.</p>
<p>How does the screen on the GS 2 compare to the Galaxy Nexus?  I might actually prefer this phone, if it really does have JB.</p>
<p>What? why? The screen is way better on the nexus and touch wiz, is at best an aquired taste. The Picture quality of the GS 2 might be better but the Galaxy Nexus Camera responds quicker and has a better interface. Galaxy Nexus will be supported until probably next year, and even though Samsung has surpassed expectations, Jelly Bean will be the last update to this phone.</p>
<p>Mostly because it&#8217;s a reasonable size at 4.3&quot;.  4.7&quot; phones are too big for me.</p>
<p>I found a side-by-side of the screens, and the GS2 is pretty low rez compared to the Nexus.  I was wondering if the RGB stripe compared to pentile would be a big difference, but the resolution is a bigger change.</p>
<p>The S@ has a lower resolution but it doesn&#8217;t appear so due to the Super Amoled Plus screen, the colours appear richer and more contrasted which makes up for the lower res</p>
<p>Shame Samsung never used the same screen tech as the Galaxy Nexus and made a 1024&#215;400 4&quot; phone or an 1152&#215;648 4.3&quot; phone.  They&#8217;d have the identical PPI number, but be easier to use in one hand.</p>
<p>But then they couldn&#8217;t market it as &#8220;720p in your hand&#8221;.  It&#8217;s &#8220;merely&#8221; retina, like the iPhone 4/5.</p>
<p>I am already rocking 4.2.1 with CyanogenMod on my GGSII</p>
<p>Is the actual GS2 getting Jellybean?</p>
<p>Samsung. Just stop. People like your phones, but if you keep launching everything your interns dream up under the Galaxy name, they&#8217;ll just get confused and buy elsewhere.</p>
<p>This has to be one of Samsung&#8217;s most retarded moves yet.</p>
<p>No not at all since Samsung said that the are going to sell it as a low to mid range phone and a pre-paid phone, so being Jelly Bean out of the box really is what makes it a Plus considering that, plus imagine future android OS Updates</p>
<p>I hope they release it on Verizon. Would trade my bionic for it. Just for a change.</p>
<p>Why does everyone feel the need to shit out hundreds of irrelevant phones rather than devoting resources into making their actual flagships good? HTC was on the right track but even they got distracted.</p>
<p>Well at the Wallmart in Sainte Agathe Quebec they are selling an  unlocked SIIx 16gig 1.5 GHz$ cdn&#8230;</p>
<p>250$cdn</p>
<p>Well Galaxy S2 truly rocks!! It has amazing features. <a href="http://remodelproducts.com">Cabinets Bay Area</a></p>
<p>Just in time for Google to announce Android 5.0!</p>
<p><strong>sigh</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure Verizon Galaxy Nexus will get that sometime in the year 2014.</p>
<p>Your hyperbole is not amusing.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t amusing because it is mostly true. Painfully so, if you bought the Galaxy Nexus in hopes of the promise of timely updates pushed out immediate by Google and for Verizon to get out of the way on at least one phone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all relative, as it still managed to get the latest update ahead of every other flagship Android phone.</p>
<p>So now we should look forward to Verizon Nexus devices being <em>relatively</em> like actual Nexus devices?</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then I&#8217;m <em>relatively</em> disappointed. I guess it <em>is</em> all relative&#8230;</p>
<p>You got your update ahead of literally 99% of other Android users, is that legitimately not enough?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s totally hyperbole. Google released the 4.1 update in July. And the Verizon Nexus is getting it in September.<br />
Google  is not announcing Android 5.0 any time soon and a 2 month delay is not even remotely comparable to a 2 YEAR delay.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not amusing because it&#8217;s not hyperbole. On the other hand, iOS6 reached 25% in just 24 hours, while JB needs 2 months to reach 1.5%.</p>
<p>I definitely agree that it is not hyperbole, and there is a huge problem. But your comparison is totally invalid.</p>
<p>1. iOS6 accompanied the release of a highly anticipated phone.</p>
<p>2. The updates are not comparable and you know that. Google and Verizon have a different relationship than Apple and Verizon, and updates are handled differently. You can&#8217;t even download iOS6 over the cell network. Verizon is involved in no way whatsoever.</p>
<p>3. Many devices that are included on the &#8220;25%&#8221; you&#8217;re referring to received a crippled, half-ass version of iOS 6. How many of those are iPhone 4&#8217;s or iPad 2&#8217;s? No navigation, no Siri, tons of major &#8220;iOS 6&#8221; components removed.</p>
<p>1. iPhone5 is just barely released and few people got them. And that number is from Chitika, is released before iPhone5 received by users.<br />
2. It&#8217;s their choice to bow down to carriers, and it is not only Apple who refused to  give in to carriers; Microsoft and Blackberry too.<br />
3. You&#8217;re exaggerating with &#8220;tons components removed&#8221;, it&#8217;s only few, or just two that you mention. In Android, you still can find phones released this year with Froyo, and they are 60% of Android phones.</p>
<p>I dunno.  From software&#8217;s announcement to software&#8217;s appearance on a product, iOS and Android are pretty comparable.  They&#8217;re just handled very differently.</p>
<p>Considering how little changes in iOS from release to release, the iPhone 4 has pretty much been denied every major feature of iOS 5 and 6. But sure, it &#8220;got the upgrade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Android, you still can find phones released this year with Froyo, and they are 60% of Android phones.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s wrong. I don&#8217;t think any phone this year has been released with Froyo. A couple budget phones have been released with Gingerbread. That&#8217;s not Android&#8217;s fault. Also, you&#8217;re thinking of 60 percent of phones are Gingerbread, and again, that&#8217;s an outdated statistic.</p>
<p>For reals.  Though my glee is amusing me enough right now that it&#8217;s happening, it&#8217;ll be that much better when it actually comes.  When is MINE COMING VZW?!??</p>
<p>Why would you buy the phone from the carrier? The nexus is sold for only $350 on the play store.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that wasn&#8217;t until March or April of this year. Verizon started to sell the Galaxy Nexus in December.</p>
<p>Because that is a GSM Nexus and doesn&#8217;t work on Verizon&#8217;s CDMA network? Also the GSM doesn&#8217;t have LTE. It&#8217;s also $99 with 2 yr contract on Verizon, so you save $250 dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you save $250 dollars&#8221;<br />
The most lulzy thing I have ever read.  Congrats.</p>
<p>Why would you not want to save money? I bought a GNexus from google play for $350, which was actually closer to 400 with shipping and tax. If I could have bought it on contract for $99 I would have done it.</p>
<p>You pay the same monthly fee regardless if you buy it full price or with a 2yr contract. Wtf?</p>
<p>The way to get the most value is to upgrade whenever you can and sell the old phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You pay the same monthly fee regardless if you buy it full price or with a 2yr contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not if you buy the GSM Nexus and put it on ST or T-Mobile.  You&#8217;re not saving any money on Verizon whether they give you the phone free or not. You&#8217;re over paying Verizon massively over the 2 years you&#8217;re locked in.</p>
<p>Agreed that StraightTalk and T-Mobile&#8217;s $30 unlimited/100 min plan is great. But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about, I&#8217;m talking about if you had the chance to buy it subsidized or full price&#8230;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re saving $250 as opposed to the Play store.  Sorry to be pedantic</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about IF I HAD the choice&#8230;.forget about it. No use anyway.</p>
<p>Surely you do have the choice to go to another network, no?</p>
<p>In my area, all four networks are offered but only Verizon has:</p>
<p>1. Decent-good connection in 95 percent of areas. The others are at around 60 percent.</p>
<p>2. LTE anywhere close to here.</p>
<p>Surely not everyone lives in the area you live in and have to make choices of what carriers they use. Take my area, all four major carriers are here, but if you want any kind of signal you stay away from AT&amp;T and Sprint. That leaves you with T-Mobile and Verizon. And if you want the best signal around you get Verizon. T-Mo is still very good here. But sometimes you make a choice to leave the carrier because of bad experiences and then you are stuck with a Verizon GNex if you want a GNex.</p>
<p>So yes, choices are there, but everyone has different choices that makes sense for their area. It&#8217;s kind of like living in northern Alaska, sure you can buy a two wheel drive Honda Accord, but it wouldn&#8217;t be the best choice for your area.</p>
<p>Poor mrsbelpit. American consumers don&#8217;t want to see the error of their ways.</p>
<p>Hey buddy. :)  It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m fighting a losing battle or something.</p>
<p>I think the point the other guy was trying to make was:</p>
<p>$350 Play Store Nexus + $50/month cellular plan &gt; $99 Verizon subsidized Nexus + $50/month cellular plan</p>
<p>Assuming of course the cell plans are the same price and you are going to be on the carrier for 2 years. I personally know I will be using Verizon (or any other carrier for that matter) for 2 or more years, so getting a non-contract phone is not a matter to me. I can always buy a phone outright and change my phone in the middle of my plan anyways.</p>
<p>Though, the plan is $90 a month, play store is $30 or $50 a month.<br />
The GSM one will save you $720 per year bill wise, it pays itself off in 6 months.</p>
<p>Verizon doesn&#8217;t offer a $50/mo cellular plan. They offer $90 cellular plan. If you gotta stay with Verizon, that&#8217;s fine and dandy. But for the 95% or so of Americans who live, work, and travel in cities and suburbs, unlocked GSM ATT and T-Mobile are more than enough. And at literally half the price.  Over 2 years, the unlocked phone always comes out in front. Hell, at $350 it doesn&#8217;t even take a year to see the savings.</p>
<p>Yeah, at these prices I can get the new Nexus every year, and I don&#8217;t have to deal with horseshit carrier phones.</p>
<p>Why would I want to change networks?  Verizon has the best network in the country.  I&#8217;ve had the phone for a year, I&#8217;ve never had any interest in leaving.  Why would I spend the extra $150 for a right that I&#8217;ll never exercise?</p>
<p>&#8230;crickets&#8230;</p>
<p>Double Agreed.  I&#8217;m with Verizon and as soon as my contract is up I&#8217;m out.  I&#8217;m paying for 4G which is awesome but really I&#8217;ll be happy to get service that is half the price or less and pony up some extra cash up front next time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d go with StraightTalk&#8217;s unlimited everything for $50. I don&#8217;t think most people can get through with only 100 minutes on Tmobile&#8217;s plan. Though this new generation of smartphone usage has made many users adverse to talking on the phone.</p>
<p>Forget the 1-2 minute conversation to plan an activity, lets text about it for an hour or two. /s</p>
<p>Because you are paying $720 more than I do and I get Wifi calling and a phone that can work on other carriers if I please?</p>
<p>Why in the world would I choose T-Mobile&#8217;s network over Verizon?</p>
<p>Overall value. It&#8217;s HSPA+ network keeps pace with Verizon and ATT&#8217;s LTE averages (5-12mbps), and it&#8217;s half the price.</p>
<p>Many like myself will gladly pay more for Verizon LTE vs T-Mobile which still doesn&#8217;t have HSPA+ in the city I live in. Hmm LTE vs plain 3G on T-MO. Not a hard choice.</p>
<p>The way to get the best value is to compare pre-paid and post paid plans. The extra money you spend monthly is often for things like roaming agreements.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t need the roaming (or whatever else they offer to only post paid users), then you can save tons of money by going pre-paid, even if that means buying a 350 dollar phone up front.</p>
<p>However, I think if you are determined to use Verizon, then post and pre paid are the same.</p>
<p>To an external observer from universal GSM-land, Verizon really does seen like the worst of both worlds. Non-standard technology and eye watering prices.</p>
<p>T Mobile plans start at around $30/mo. The Balls-out unlimited it $60-70, so you do save. Plus, you can sell the phone and get the new one when it comes out.</p>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;ll have a plan on a carrier you are saving money&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, Google doesn&#8217;t sell a CDMA version, so if you want to be on VZW then you can&#8217;t get it from Google.</p>
<p>But Verizon&#8217;s LTE isn&#8217;t even faster than HSPA+ now-a-days :s</p>
<p>If anyone doesn&#8217;t believe me, this is what I was getting about 2 or 3 nights ago: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/172XN.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/172XN.png</a></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t test it now though, because I don&#8217;t get 4G inside my office.</p>
<p>I get 8mb a second no problem on vzw lte.</p>
<p>Well, I used to get 20-22 Mbps when I first got the phone. It was right after Verizon launched their LTE network so nobody was really using it. A few months back, I was getting 10-12 Mbps. And now I&#8217;m only getting 3-5 Mbps. Baltimore area, in case anyone was wondering.</p>
<p>Same here and its only going to get worse with all of the new iPhone 5 users on LTE.  My work phone this is HSPA+ is often faster than my LTE Galaxy Nexus.  I imagine some of it may be due to the backhaul network not being able to hand the capacity.</p>
<p>In San Diego, I constantly am getting 20+ up and down still, so I don&#8217;t know when the rate will fall. I don&#8217;t see it looking good past this iPhone launch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s due to 700mhz spectrum, actually.</p>
<p>700mhz is the reason why Verizon is able to roll out LTE so quickly, as the cell sizes are massive and only a few towers can cover entire cities. On the other hand, there&#8217;s only so much capacity in a given 10mhz block of spectrum. So they have a lot more users per tower than, say, a 1700mhz LTE network would.</p>
<p>Verizon took a shortcut to have a good coverage map which is going to bite them on the capacity front. Eventually they&#8217;re going to roll out LTE on the 1700 band to increase capacity as well, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if things slow down drastically over the next few months.</p>
<p>T-Mobile is the one doing it right, with HSPA+ 42, and LTE-Advanced next year.  They&#8217;re great for me right now, and it will only get better.  I just wish more consumers would take them seriously, and I hope once they get better coverage outside of metro areas they stop the massive churn.</p>
<p>And i&#8217;m betting it&#8217;s going to be a lot slower after tonight, with the release of the LTE iPhone5.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not true at all. The download speeds are comparable. LTE trounces HSPA+ in terms of latency and upload speeds.</p>
<p>I have Verizon while my fiancee has T-Mobile. Currently, shes getting faster HSPA+ speeds that I do with LTE.</p>
<p>Read my other comments, I should stop being so hastily with hitting the &#8220;POST&#8221; button.</p>
<p>I would bet she&#8217;s not getting better ping rates and faster uploads. Besides, you posted one result from one location. That doesn&#8217;t prove &#8220;Verizon’s LTE isn’t even faster than HSPA+ now-a-days&#8221; as you put it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really &#8220;get&#8221; why Verizon users refuse to accept that another network (especially little ol&#8217; &#8220;cheapo&#8221; t-mobile) can have a good network. Not everyone tries to be mediocre like Sprint and ATT.</p>

<p>^notice that was takin in 2010 &#8211; BEFORE they even rolled out 42mbps HSPA+</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t what I was saying and, btw, I use both networks. I&#8217;m talking about the misconception that HSPA+ 42 is on the same level as LTE. The download speeds are comparable. <a href="http://goo.gl/XkfoQ">LTE has the upper hand with upload and latency</a>. Unless you&#8217;re doing straight downloads only, upload speeds and ping are important.</p>
<p>Posted 9 months ago&#8230;.</p>
<p>I went to a couple verizon stores in my area (Madison WI) and asked them to run the speedtest app on their phones on LTE and they got between 5mb &#8211; 10mb.</p>
<p>Running the tests at the same time on my hspa+ phone on AT&amp;T I got between 3mb &#8211; 5mb.  So LTE is faster in my area but not drastically so.  I am hoping that AT&amp;T LTE in my area will be faster, when it gets here&#8230;</p>
<p>Again, that&#8217;s just download speeds. Ping and upload speeds can be dramatically different depending on the area. Look at <a href="http://goo.gl/XkfoQ">these results</a> for example.</p>
<p>Verizon was the exclusive American launch partner for the phone. I, naively, bought it because I thought it would be updated similarly to previous Nexus phones. Big mistake. The LTE speeds are fantastic, but the way Verizon handles updates is disappointing. I&#8217;m hoping that by the time my contract is up, competing LTE networks will be better so that I can leave these laggards.</p>
<p>Agreed.  The only regret I have with my purchase of the Galaxy Nexus is the slow VZW  updates.  I&#8217;ve seriously considered installing it myself a few times, it&#8217;s just not worth the hassle.</p>
<p>Because I got it for $199 in November 2011?</p>
<p><strong>GSM</strong> Nexus is on the Play Store.<br />
Yes, you can get the GSM Nexus and find a cheap carrier to use it on, but then you either have to pay a $350 ETF at Verizon, or keep the line open and keep paying both Verizon and StraightTalk at the same time.<br />
So no, no money saved.  Switching carriers isn&#8217;t just a matter of buying a different phone.</p>
<p>ETF is money saved depending on where you are in your contract.</p>
<p>you also assume that someone is constantly on contract terms. not always true.</p>
<p>one day, the internet will learn the stupidity of absolutes in arguments.</p>
<p>No money saved, huh? Ok, lets do the math.</p>
<p>$350+$350 = $700. Monthly plan on Straight-Talk (unlimited voice, 2GB data, unl text) which can use either ATT or T-Mobile&#8217;s network (you choose) is $45/mo.</p>
<p>Verizon&#8217;s Galaxy Nexus is $99 today. Cheapest monthly plan is $100/mo for unlimited voice/txt + 2GB data.</p>
<p>Total cost over 2 years for the Verizon route = $2,500.<br />
Total cost over 2 years for the GSM route = $1780<br />
- And that assumes you have to pay the full ETF, and dont change to a cheaper prepaid competitor anytime in those 2 years.</p>
<p>So yes, yes money saved.</p>
<p>clarifying:<br />
1. the $350+$350 refers to $350 for the unlocked Nexus + $350 full ETF.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have to pay the ETF, that drops your total 2 year cost to $1430. If you can keep your minutes to around 100min, then your savings increases even more &#8211; down to $1070 over 2 years.</p>
<p>My friends, $1500 is a down-payment on a cheap car.</p>
<p>If you cant go with ATT or T-Mobile in your area, then that&#8217;s one thing. But the number of people who refuse to do basic math is truly astounding.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting those numbers.  Alternatively, on a T-Mobile family Value plan (if you want the benefits of postpaid coverage) you can get 1000 minutes, unlimited text, and 5 gigs of data including tethering without having to screw around with your phone for $110 per month (2 lines).  Add in T-Mo&#8217;s desperation to keep contract customers and they give you a $10 data credit, all you have to do is ask.  I also get a 10% student rate discount that anybody could get.  By buying my phones from Google, I never have to renew the contract, either.</p>
<p>I believe your points, and you actually got me to do a little research on Straight Talk.  Definitely worth my money to buy a phone off-contract and head to Straight Talk.  But then I found that Straight Talk&#8217;s terms of service don&#8217;t allow for streaming media, and more forum searching found ridiculous limits and stories of getting their number terminated&#8230; so while Straight Talk is cheaper, it&#8217;s also not on the same level as Verizon or AT&amp;T.  I can leave Verizon for AT&amp;T, but now I can&#8217;t consider leaving for Straight Talk.  With my Spotify &amp; Dropbox Mobile Upload dependencies, Straight Talk isn&#8217;t the answer.  Then there&#8217;s LTE vs HSPA+ to be considered&#8230;</p>
<p>Now it seems like you&#8217;re comparing a $5 apple to a $3 orange and concluding that the orange is better.</p>

<p>Jelly Bean was technically going to be Android 5, so basically we are getting 5 right now.</p>
<p>But yes, Verizon and their uber slow updates :/</p>
<p>verizon has finally released 4.1 jelly been today for sgs3 i updated my samsung galaxy s3 using this tutorial<br />
<a href="http://www.smartphonesupdates.com/how-to-get-android-4-1-jelly-bean-update-for-verizon-samsung-galaxy-s3/" target="_blank">http://www.smartphonesupdates.com/how-to-get-android-4-1-jelly-bean-update-for-verizon-samsung-galaxy-s3/</a></p>
<p>Canada also got our 4.1.1 update on our GSM ones around 2 weeks ago and it was our first update since 4.0.1, be happy verizon customers that you didn&#8217;t have to suffer through 4.0.1</p>
<p>^ this.<br />
For all the things android has done, they have no where near gotten updates sorted out.</p>
<p>You see, people don&#8217;t realize that. When VZW got 4.0.1, they sent it back to Google for fixing. We then got 4.0.2 . Then Google put together 4.0.3, which was also shoddy. VZW sent it back. We then got 4.0.4. Same thing happened with Jelly Bean. Now, Google put together a version of 4.1 that&#8217;s good. We&#8217;re getting that now. Note to Google: Do it right the first time, please.</p>
<p>Name a smartphone company that has ever &#8220;done it right the first time&#8221;.</p>
<p>Erm, I was using 4.1 since it was announced, and nothing about it felt broken. Actually, it felt less broken the the VZW build I have now&#8230;</p>
<p>People probably don&#8217;t realize that because there&#8217;s no evidence to support it.</p>
<p>Especially since 4.1.1 has been out since early July, not sure what that dude is talking about.</p>
<p>If Google could actually update the device without Verizon approving it, then I&#8217;m sure we wouldn&#8217;t be seeing these huge delays in updates.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that the CDMA/LTE drivers aren&#8217;t even in AOSP.</p>
<p>Whats the deal with the canadian gsm versions then?<br />
In certain cases it is right to blame carriers, but google is just at fault for this</p>
<p>Canadians GSM versions can be moved onto the official Google update path via flashing yakju, CDMA versions can not.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;re not maguro/yakju, then Google doesn&#8217;t update them. I heard that you can flash yakju on to the GSM Canadian phones, which then you should get updates from Google.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not completely disagreeing with you, but regarding the CDMA/LTE drivers not being in AOSP&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;neither are the GSM drivers. Third party stuff was removed a while ago (I&#8217;m betting because of situations like this).</p>
<p>The Android source code for the GSM and CDMA Galaxy Nexus&#8217; is the same, only the drivers are different and the drivers are not part of the source.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the drivers for Nexus phones, hosted by Google and includes CDMA/LTE and GSM binaries for Android 4.1.1. They&#8217;ve been available for a long time (since the Jelly Bean release actually). To use them you download the Android source from the AOSP, download the drivers for your device, compile and flash. <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/drivers</a></p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t build and push an update because Verizon won&#8217;t let them (bad on Verizon agree 100%), but there&#8217;s nothing saying you can&#8217;t build your own AOSP build for the CDMA Galaxy Nexus (at least the toro, the toroplus is a little more of a gray area, as you&#8217;ll notice the drivers are even hosted for the toroplus).</p>
<p>I betting that the Canada version isn&#8217;t maguro/yakju.</p>
<p>The Canada version can be flashed with yakju, same with all the locked GSM versions. Although it does not unlock the SIM lock.</p>
<p>If you can flash yakju, then you should be getting updates even if it is SIM locked.</p>
<p>if you do**</p>
<p>Yes you do. There is no hardware difference.</p>
<p>4.0.4 on CDMA is horrible, I&#8217;d rather be on 4.0.1 still, I had much better battery life then.</p>
<p>Awesome. About time Google sent over a version that worked properly. Looking forward to some Google Now goodness I&#8217;ve been enjoying on the Nex7.</p>
<p>Wait, Is this google&#8217;s fault? I always thought it was the providers who were holding back the updates?</p>
<p>Ha, it&#8217;s Verizon&#8217;s deal.  The fault that lies with Google is that they made this US exclusive on Verizon for 4 months.  I hope to hell that doesn&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>This plus one thousand.</p>
<p>This is true in my case. I would have switched to Android long ago when they announced the Galaxy Nexus, but since it took so long to come to GSM carriers subsidized, I decided to wait for the next iPhone instead.</p>
<p>Completely agreed. Verizon doesn&#8217;t treat this like a Nexus phone at all. I feel duped by Google and Verizon. This particular phone isn&#8217;t really a Nexus phone.</p>
<p>4.1.1 has been out for a few months.</p>
<p>this is verizon&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>And this is why I stay with the iPhone. I hate being behind on updates- and here is the flagship nexus device which had to wait several months to receive the new android update.</p>
<p>Nah, the flagship nexus device is the GSM Galaxy Nexus. This is a misnamed/mismanaged SoaB that Verizon controls.</p>
<p>Even worse if you&#8217;re with Sprint. That version isn&#8217;t even updated by Google.</p>
<p>To be fair, the Sprint Gnex got Jellybean already, maybe 3 weeks or so ago.  That said, I have the GSM one and it&#8217;s the true Android experience.</p>
<p>Hold on there! Sprint pushed its Jelly Bean update 2-3 weeks ago. And Wallet works out of the box on Sprint. And there is no bloatware on Sprint&#8217;s version. And Sprint offers full Google Voice integration (which is awesome, by the way). The  only thing Verizon&#8217;s Nexus has on Sprint&#8217;s is the network. In terms of support, Sprint is holding it down. (Sprint also gave me 2 free extended batteries, so there&#8217;s that too).</p>
<p>I just get annoyed when people lump the Sprint and Verizon variants together just because they are both CDMA. They are marketed and supported differently by each carrier.</p>
<p>Sprint has an exclusive contract with Google Wallet, thus why it works out of the box.</p>
<p>My point stands. Sprint has <strong>definitely</strong> supported its Nexus better than Verizon. Verizon&#8217;s network is superior, but they are too slow with updates. Sprint actually seems to embrace the Nexus whereas Verizon seems to tolerate it.</p>
<p>The funny part is that Verizon HAS their proprietary drivers available (not open source, but available to AOSP), so unlocked users could have built 4.1 months ago, flawlessly. Sprint does not have their drivers available to AOSP, but still got it out first.</p>
<p>People did build 4.1 months ago.</p>
<p>Agreed, I have been using 4.1 since a few days after it was released for the GSM Nexus on my VZW Nexus.  Verizon doesn&#8217;t show any support for the device but since it is just as easily unlocked, rooted, and adding a new ROM is simple I am quite happy.</p>
<p>It used to be &#8220;just buy a Nexus.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the advice is &#8220;well, you have to buy the right Nexus, and not subsidized, and wait don&#8217;t forget to hold down shift and alt when you click Buy or else you won&#8217;t get updates!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hah, true &#8211; however, Google knows this is fucked up and I don&#8217;t see this kind of crap happening again since they added devices to the Play Store.  I hope I&#8217;m right.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think the Galaxy Nexus was sort of a test device. Nexus One was sold by Google with no carrier support and it flopped. Verizon chose to release the Incredible; Sprint chose to release the EVO. Nexus S was sold through Best Buy Mobile at first and could only be subsidized at certain BBM locations. It was later sold directly by Google, and subsidized by Sprint and AT&amp;T (shout out to AT&amp;T Nexus S owners), with mixed results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure Google realized that they had to get their phone on Verizon, which at the time was the only US carrier with LTE. Verizon also has the largest amount post-paid subscribers in the US. Objectively, I think Google <strong>must</strong> to sell through Verizon if to reach the largest group of post-paid subscribers in the US. With that in mind, Google made a deal with Verizon. (<em>I&#8217;d love to read a Verge feature on what really happened with the Galaxy Nexus launch in the US</em>.) Google also launched the Galaxy Nexus in more global markets than before, which meant it had to leverage Samsung to handle the updates for certain regions. The Galaxy Nexus has also been a commercial flop.</p>
<p>Hopefully Google &#8212; having learned its lessons from the the previous three Nexus devices &#8212; sells the next Nexus through Google Play on &#8220;Day One&#8221;, along with simultaneous launched on the major carriers like AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon. Anything less is a fail. If Apple can do, Google can too.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget t-mobile!  Why does everybody always forget them? :)<br />
I think your analysis is spot on, and I wonder how well the GNex sold on Verizon?  Does Google have any clout with them as of yet?</p>
<p>The main thing is for them to sell it through the Play Store on day one, like you said, however, is that going to sit well with carriers like AT&amp;T?  It will be interesting to see how this all shakes out.</p>
<p>I would imagine pretty well. Verizon was pushing the Galaxy Nexus as a back-to-school phone, and considering the fact that it was the unrivaled best LTE phone on their network, they probably got it into a lot of hands. Needed to grab that Droid Incredible crowd as it updated.</p>
<p>Also, every GNex I have seen in public (there&#8217;s 2 in my office of 30!) is verizon.</p>
<p>GNex does not sell well at all</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/20/3256590/samsung-galaxy-nexus-minuscule-sales-apple" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/20/3256590/samsung-galaxy-nexus-minuscule-sales-apple</a></p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t mean to slight T-Mobile! T-Mobile seems content to support the Nexus line without selling it. I hope that it launches on T-Mobile too, but based on recent history, it just doesn&#8217;t seem likely. I hope I&#8217;m wrong!</p>
<p>2011 and we&#8217;re still &#8220;testing&#8221; ?  really?</p>
<p>Sadly, that&#8217;s what it seems like. Google is still trying to figure out how to sell Nexus phones in America. It isn&#8217;t easy. Google can offer an awesome unlocked device through Google Play but most US consumers buy their phones through carriers. Apple realized this in 2011 by launching its devices on AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon, four years after the first iPhone was launched. Two years after the launch of the Galaxy S, Samsung has finally, in 2012, figured out how to sell its Galaxy S through US carriers. It took two multinational corporations a combined 6 years to sell their phones on each US carrier. It can&#8217;t be easy.</p>
<p>That said, anything less than a simultaneous launch on Google Play <strong>and</strong> the US carriers is a failure. The reason the Galaxy Nexus flopped in the US is because of lack of availability (outside of Verizon) for about 7-8 months after it launched.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worse than just Verizon, though. I bought a GSM Nexus (unsubsidised) from Expansys and it turned out to be yakjuxw.</p>
<p>Flash yakju, everything will work</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I did (and then sold it fairly soon afterwards). It did rather sour my first experience of Nexus ownership, though.</p>
<p>Yeah, I nearly forgot about that.  It&#8217;s inexcusable for Samsung not to roll out the update when it&#8217;s literally the same phone.  Google needs to take control of the Nexus line, and not rely on the manufacturer (especially when it&#8217;s Sammy)</p>
<p>It used to also not be offered on CDMA carriers. Coincidence? I think not.</p>
<p>I think quite a few iPhone users right now wish they were behind on updates</p>
<p>Thank god for facebook sharing, the only functional feature added by the amazing new update, brought to you exclusively by Apple.</p>
<p>What other old Android feature can the co-opt next? A file system?</p>
<p>iCloud tabs and the ability to upload photos in the browser are nice additions too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll agree that most of the changes are small or incremental aside from Maps (which is a negative change).</p>
<p>However, they tend to introduce a TON of new APIs so we may see some cool new things from developers in the next year that weren&#8217;t as possible before.</p>
<p>Certainly less than Android users wish to have the latest update</p>
<p>By the way, I am happy with IOS6 so far.  It feels fast and smooth even on IPhone 4.  The new map needs alot more work but I rarely use the old one anyway.</p>
<p>Have fun with your new Apple Map application.</p>
<p>If you have an iPhone, you&#8217;re behind on updates.</p>
<p>I wish I was behind on updates on my 4S. Oh to go back to the halcyon days of iOS 5&#8230;..</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re enjoying the latest iOS update&#8230;oh wait, the Maps app is completely fucked up now! Have fun with that!</p>
<p>Too little too late. I&#8217;m getting my iPhone 5 today.</p>
<p>So&#8230; it&#8217;s not too late</p>
<p>Lol, it really is too late. I would have stuck with my Verizon GN if I had received the update months ago.</p>
<p>No you wouldn&#8217;t.  Nobody switches phones because they were a month late on a minor update.</p>
<p>How is Jelly Bean a minor update?</p>
<p>Because it is.  That&#8217;s why it is 4.1, not 5.0.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re going off of the numerica value instead of the actual features. That&#8217;s not smart at all. Check out the Nexus 7 review on this site. Josh said Jelly Bean was a big improvement.</p>
<p>It sounds like you have no personal experience with Jelly Bean. No sane person that has used ICS and JB would say that the latter is a minor update.</p>
<p>there might be significant ux improvements but it has nothing to do with whether it&#8217;s a major or minor update</p>
<p>How is basing the type of update based off of major/minor version numbers not being smart?  If Google is telling us that that JB is a bump to .1, then that would be a minor upgrade by definition.  What would you call Honeycomb or ICS?  A super duper major update?  No, those are the major updates.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s talk about the new features added with JB.  I count three big ones: Project Butter, Google Now, and Expandable notifications.  While they are great, I wouldn&#8217;t call three things a major update.  Honeycomb was a major update.  ICS was a major update.  JB is a minor update that adds very few new things and smooths out the UI.</p>
<p> BTW, I put JB on my Galaxy Nexus the day after it was announced.</p>
<p>The update from Android 1.5 to 1.6 was enormous, as was the update from 2.1 to 2.2. Visually for the end user of course the updates look less drastic than 2.3 to 4.0, but the amount of Android which changed in those releases is actually quite astounding given the small incremental update the numbering implies. 1.6 is a particularly good example, as it had more in common with Android 2.0 than it did with Android 1.5.</p>
<p>&#8220;Android 1.6 is a minor platform release deployable to Android-powered handsets since October 2009. &quot;<br />
<a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-1.6.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-1.6.html</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Android 2.2 is a minor platform release including user features, developer features, API changes, and bug fixes.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-2.2.html</a></p>
<p>I think you have to ignore the numbers and go by how significant you feel the update is.  After all, if you go by numbers, then obviously, iOS 6 is a MAJOR update.  I just don&#8217;t know if I agree with that.</p>
<p>Android improvement over previous versions are merely version number.</p>
<p>Thanks for speaking for what I would or wouldn&#8217;t do, but Jelly Bean was a major update and it was over a month late.</p>
<p>Sorry, it just doesn&#8217;t make sense to me.  You wanted this &#8220;major&#8221; update so badly that you are now completely switching platforms because you didn&#8217;t get it quickly enough?  It sounds like you weren&#8217;t happy with Android in general.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been with Android for 4 years; I started with the G1. I love Android. I think the operating system is wonderful, evolving  greatly over the years, and Google&#8217;s integration is perfect. However, I don&#8217;t like the manufacturers that are making Android phones. The update scheme that they have going where they push off updates to focus resources instead on releasing new products is awful. It&#8217;s a major flaw that Google will not step-in and hold these manufacturers to a higher standard for customers. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m leaving Android.</p>
<p>I left Android after Verizon released the RAZR Maxx &#8211; having bought the RAZR on launch day, I felt completely shafted for having my purchase so quickly superceded.  If I had kept it, I&#8217;d just barely be getting ICS.<br />
Some of y&#8217;all may not understand, but I completely understand Soccerfon711.  The only reason I still have my HTC Rezound is because I can&#8217;t live without LTE, and am holding out for Christmas to buy myself a Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>you feel jipped because someone else has one with a bigger battery than you</p>
<p>are you 12?</p>
<p>In Android community, most of them are 12.</p>
<p>And you act like you&#8217;re 10.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah!  Well you act like your 3!</p>
<p>Read what he said.  its the same company.  <br />
There is no need to insult others</p>
<p>I feel jipped because I paid $300 for a device on launch day only to have it superceded by a phone that they were obviously planning since before the Razr was announced.  They announced the RAZR Maxx a month after I had invested $300 into the RAZR.</p>
<p>And how is that Android&#8217;s fault?</p>
<p>Flawed logic can not be reasoned with.</p>
<p>As a CDMA (VZW) Galaxy Nexus owner &#8211; I don&#8217;t blame you a bit.  I&#8217;m seriously considering it myself.</p>
<p>Actually, the GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus of are which sold SIM-locked also received the update pretty much at the same time as the unlocked version.</p>
<p>Which GMS Galaxy Nexus&#8217; were SIM-locked?</p>
<p>Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but isn&#8217;t it a European law that they can&#8217;t SIM-lock devices?</p>
<blockquote> but isn’t it a European law that they can’t SIM-lock devices?</blockquote>
<p>In the UK (probably same for most of EU) an operator must unlock the phone if the contract has reached its end and they may charge a small fee.</p>
<p>However, if you brought a Galaxy Nexus from an operator here, its most likely locked to that operator. However its usually around £10 to get it unlocked.</p>
<p>But it still got direct updates from Google.</p>
<p>Well, I forgot about Canada. Oh Canada&#8230;</p>
<p>Not the one with yakjuxw firmware.</p>
<p>This delay pissed me off a big deal&#8212;of course, it was sort of foreseeable that Google&#8217;s first pure Nexus device will have this issue, but I hope enough people make enough of a noise so Big Red do someething about it.</p>
<blockquote>Google’s first pure Nexus device</blockquote>
<p>What exactly do you mean by that?</p>
<p>I mean VZW&#8217;s first, sry</p>
<p>No problem :)</p>
<p>Sadly, it&#8217;s not Verizon first &#8220;pure&#8221; Nexus device. It&#8217;s more like Verizons tainted Nexus device.</p>
<p>The Pure Nexus Devices are the unlocked GSM Versions.  Unfortunatly the Spring and Verizon ones were always going to have updates delayed by Their perspective carriers.  Not that, that makes it alright.  I have a Verizon Galaxy Nexus and once my contract is up I&#8217;m going for the next Nexus Phone unlocked so I don&#8217;t have to put up with this carrier crap.</p>
<p>BTW CyanogenMod 10 is in alpha but it has been working great for over a month that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m running.</p>
<p>Agreed. The Vzw Nexus isn&#8217;t a true Nexus. In a way I see it more as a DROID but labelled as a Nexus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pure Nexus Devices are the unlocked GSM Versions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the locked GSM Galaxy Nexus&#8217;s got updates directly from Google. So Unlocked SIM =! Timely Updates.</p>
<p>The ones sold by Google are the only pure Nexuses IMO.</p>
<p>How so? They got updates straight from Google. Also Google does not sell unlocked GNexus&#8217;s in the UK, but Amazon etc do, are they not pure?</p>
<p>The only difference with the ones sold by the operators were that they had a SIM-lock, which if its a subsidized phone is acceptable for the contract duration.</p>
<p>I guess the ones that get pure updates from Google are. I&#8217;d only buy an unlocked Nexus though. I wouldn&#8217;t buy it SIM locked; not taking the risk.</p>
<p>Many of the GNex sold in the UK had yakjuxw firmware, and got (delayed) updates from Samsung.</p>
<p>I know because I bought one from Expansys.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the Sprint Galaxy Nexus is updated by Samsung, so updates will be even further behind. How it could retain the name &#8220;Nexus&#8221; is beyond me.</p>
<p>The Sprint Galaxy Nexus received Jelly Bean 2 or 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Wow, thanks Verizon for holding back the update, I&#8217;m sure the extensive testing will make up for the long delay, said no one ever</p>
<p>For all the stuff Verizon is pissing me off about right now, this is not really one of them. It takes longer than it should, not doubt, but they also skipped at least two revisions that came from Google properly hosed up, which meant I never had to deal with having an outright broken firmware. Since unlike on iOS when a new version comes out, it doesn&#8217;t mean you can no longer use or update applications if you don&#8217;t get the newest version (particularly the Apple vs Google first party apps) , I can live with that for a couple months.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m in the minority but I think people get too up in arms about it. In the grand scheme of android problems that&#8217;s pretty minor. :)</p>
<p>This had to be a Verizon issue, the cdma Sprint version came out weeks ago.</p>
<p>WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY THIS IS. WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY INDEED.</p>
<p>Who cares!  I&#8217;ve had Jelly Bean running on my Verizon Gnex for months!  I even managed to compile a working Jelly Bean Rom from source code (ended up going with CM10).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I bought a Nexus.</p>
<blockquote>That’s why I bought a Nexus.</blockquote>
<p>You can run CyanogenMod on any phone (well, on some of them). You buy a Nexus to <i>not have to</i>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hell of a lot easier to do so on a nexus. Unlockable bootloaders and such.</p>
<p>HTC devices have unlockable bootloaders.</p>
<p>Oh yeah&#8230;I heard they&#8217;re up to 3 phones that you can unlock now.</p>
<p>The fact that it&#8217;s standardized hardware is actually even more of a factor, since you can unlock most phones with little effort. It means CM and other Roms are actually likely to work fully, rather than having half-broken drivers. :)</p>
<p>the nexus has two sides. and the ridiculously easy unlocking process should not be ignored.</p>
<p>You are so awesome.  If only everyone could be as cool as you.  Please pardon our happiness over such a meaningless event.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous. In the UK my GSM galaxy nexus got the update the minute it was released. US carriers need to sort their ideas out.  I&#8217;m hoping for a cracking new nexus phone by the time my contract ends in March (something made with some high-grade materials), or else it might be back to the iphone, if just so I can also use the stupid new maps app on my phone as well as on my ipad.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely worth it, using the new maps is akin to gauging ones eyes out with a rusty hook.</p>
<p>Never going to happen, US carriers are greedy control freaks</p>
<p>It bothered me a little that the updates were slow from Verizon. But that was the case with my iPhone 4. It took forever to get in &#8220;sync&#8221; with the rest of the iOS updates.</p>
<p>What bothers me is that, yes &#8230; I did use a roundabout method to get Wallet installed but since then, it worked fine and it updated fine through the Play Store. Now, I can&#8217;t even use it or wipe it because the current version of Wallet is not compatible with my device. I mean, really Google? Really?</p>
<p>Google seriously needs to b* slap Verizon, and not allow them to control the device.</p>
<p>They have no choice, its a CDMA device.</p>
<p>Here they got a work around the Google/Verizon block of wallet and it works. <br />
<a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2012/09/14/google-wallet-no-longer-working-at-all-on-verizon-galaxy-nexus/#comment-650598964" target="_blank">http://www.droid-life.com/2012/09/14/google-wallet-no-longer-working-at-all-on-verizon-galaxy-nexus/#comment-650598964</a></p>
<p>Nevermind the fact that the VZW Galaxy Nexus wasn&#8217;t supposed to have access to Google Wallet in the first place&#8230;</p>
<p>I did admit that I did have to use a roundabout way to install Wallet on my phone. The problem is that with their new policies in place about the prepaid card, I wanted to use most of it so that I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the remaining balance. I&#8217;m still going to have to ask for a refund for the remaining amount but it&#8217;s small enough that I don&#8217;t care. And yeah, I used Jescobar&#8217;s link to get it working again. One good thing about Android &#8211; there is a workaround.</p>
<p>Not that all this matters anymore anyway. My iPhone 5 is on the truck. Yes, Maps suck (I previewed in on my iPad) and it&#8217;s no way perfect but at least Apple has enough balls and clout to keep Verizon off of their product. Plus, I&#8217;m kind of looking forward to not having to micromanage my usage to make sure I have enough juice for the whole day.</p>
<p>Oh. And this tiered rollout crap is old too. If an update is available, make it available for everyone.</p>
<p>So, this update- will it wipe the phone? /dumb-but-earnest</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Unless you are coming from a custom ROM, then you should wipe.</p>
<p>These phone companies will always put off  updating the phones bc they want you to buy the latest phone with the latest os.  This only means the nexus 2 will have an updated os when it is released.</p>
<p>Anybody who cared one cent about this update would have just done it manually back in July like I did.  I&#8217;ve been running stock JB on my VZ GNEX since the night it was announced at the I/O conference.</p>
<p>Pure Stock. Like Butter.</p>
<p>My mom has this phone, and if she lived closer to me I&#8217;d have done it for her.  She likes the phone anyway.</p>
<p>I wish more people told us about how awesome they are because they rooted their phones and installed some way-cool OS instead of waiting for the OTA.</p>
<p>Sorry I&#8217;m late, but CM10 is the best. That is all.</p>
<p>i&#8217;d have to say that i&#8217;m pretty awesome, cause i&#8217;ve been running JB since just after I/O. would not go back to ICS, that&#8217;s how nice it is, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been missing.</p>
<p>There is a god. unfortunately there are demi-god&#8217;s who suck at rolling out updates.</p>
<p>About freaking time!</p>
<p>I thought this was the sort of shit the Nexus programme was designed to avoid?</p>
<p>Thank god my Nexus 7 isn&#8217;t associated with any shitty US carriers.</p>
<p>Where is the link to the pdf on Verizon?  Trying to search their site is torture.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.verizonwireless.com%2Fpdf%2Fsystem_update%2Fsamsung_galaxy_nexus_instructions.pdf" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.verizonwireless.com%2Fpdf%2Fsystem_update%2Fsamsung_galaxy_nexus_instructions.pdf</a></p>
<p>It is linked in the Verge article as the source.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a screenshot of the about screen? I&#8217;d like to see the version numbers for the radios and the release info for the ROM. I installed the leaked version from Google about two weeks ago, and if it&#8217;s the same, I won&#8217;t bother with the upgrade, as I&#8217;ll have to clear the phone and downgrade back to stock ICS first.</p>
<p>Baseband version: I515.10 V.FF02 / I515.FG02</p>
<p>Kernel version: 3.0.31-g396c4df<br />
android-build@vpbs1 )</p>

	<li>SMP PREEMPT Mon Jul 16 18:08:06 PDT</li>
</ol>
<p>So exactly the same radios I&#8217;ve run for near a month.</p>
<p>Actually, my radios are almost the same, except the first one is 1515.09, not 151.10. I don&#8217;t have a clue what those numbers mean, but mine is different. Everything else is identical, though.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s the hardware revision.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised they did it so quickly. It took months and months and months for VZW to roll out 4.0.4. Honestly after that fiasco I didn&#8217;t expect JB before Christmas. I was tired of waiting two months ago and rooted and installed 4.1.1.</p>
<p>Verizon, meh.</p>
<p>I was expecting the S3 to receive its JB update before the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Buy a Nexus, they said.<br />
Will get instant updates, they said.</p>
<p>Blame the carriers, they said.<br />
GSM variants get instant updates, they said.<br />
Grasping at straws, they said.</p>
<p>Only if it&#8217;s yakju, they said.</p>
<p>The main downside of Android phones. You never get any kind of updates.</p>
<p>lolwut?</p>
<p>Great post buddy. Fits perfectly in this article.</p>
<p>Yeah, buddy.</p>
<p>Oh Verizon rolls out a new 3 month old update on a Nexus device&#8230; that&#8217;s cute.</p>
<p>2*</p>
<p>July 15 &#8211; Sept 21</p>
<p>I think the biggest slap in the face to me was my Xoom got Jelly Bean before my Nexus&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>Well, at least it only took two months this time instead of the four months the 4.0.4 update took.</p>
<p>Love my GSM Nexus.</p>
<p>Cool. I&#8217;m considering picking one of these up for around $300 to replace my iPhone 4.. since I think iOS 6 is pretty pathetic.</p>
<p>The differences between 4.0.4 to 4.1. aren&#8217;t THAT big that such a stink needs to be made over the update lag. Aside from Google Now and some of the changes to how items are shared I wouldn&#8217;t say Jellybean is a huge leap but rather a small hop. A bigger hop than 4.0.2 to 4.0.4, which people still foam out the mouth over (quick name one thing that changed off the top of your head), but still a hop. Take a deep breath. Cope.</p>
<p>power menu.</p>
<p>visually, i think that was it.</p>
<p>and that actually was off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Oh wait&#8230;the update I&#8217;ve already had on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus since July? <br />
Thanks Verizon.</p>
<p>One word, CM10.</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;ve been running the Alpha/Nightly builds for months now as my day to day ROM and everything works great. Screw waiting for Verizon to get their act together.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the wallpaper in the image?</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Just bought my iPhone 5. Rolling my Nexus back to stock now and relocating the bootloader so I can use it as my secondary device.</p>
<p>Time to put them to the test. Might put a video on YouTube.</p>
<p>By no means is it the consumer way to do it, but I&#8217;ve been running Jelly Bean on my Sprint Galaxy Nexus for about 2 months now thanks to XDA.</p>
<p>Not even suggesting most people do this, but just thought I should give a shout out to XDA on here. They&#8217;re the shit.</p>
<p>at the risk of sounding stupid, I went to vzw&#8217;s website, signed in, but couldn&#8217;t find the pdf. Does anyone know where I can find the Holy Grail? thanks</p>
<p>VZW has a typo on the link at the bottom of the PDF announcing the new Jelly Bean update.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty sad.</p>
<p>Screw Verizon&#8230; I&#8217;ve been running 4.1.1 since it came out.  It makes me happy when I free tether on 4G.  I gave up on them ever giving us updates timely, so I just unlocked, rooted, and went on to the ROMs&#8230;</p>
<p>download gnextollkit, press the &#8220;do-it-all&#8221; button, slap cm10.zip on sd, boot to recovery, install <del>-</del> done.<br />
i have the gsm version, i had JB on my device hours after the IO, got the link from a pal who has the verizon nexus, he had it earlier on his device that i did. seriously, who buys a nexus and waits for a lousy carrier? that makes no sense.</p>
<p>The whole point of buying a Nexus for me at least was to get the latest STOCK updates ASAP from Google. Obviously, I failed due to my devotion to Verizon. I do like their network, but their handling of this kind of stuff has been grating on me. At any rate, buying a Nexus doesn&#8217;t mean installing custom ROMs, because theoretically you should already get the latest and greatest by default. Your actually kind of going against the curve for reasons to buy a Nexus. You can root nearly any phone and install whatever you want on it.</p>
<p>You still get it before other phones on VZW. Not many other phones had day one JB ROMs either.</p>
<p>You can root nearly any phone, but &#8230;</p>
<p>It is considerably harder<br />
You risk breaking it<br />
You use unofficial hacks and rootkits<br />
Your device is not supported by google in any way<br />
No source, no drivers, no kernel<br />
Few original roms, most if not all are nexus-trickledowns<br />
All is in the hands of a handful developers and cm10</p>
<p>Google released r6 for instance, just a couple of days ago. You get that on your device by a single click. Why waiting months, either for google or verizon.</p>
<p>My initial root process on my Galaxy Nexus was actually considerably harder than on my old Droid 1. Eventually, of course, the release of the awesome GNex Toolkit made this much, much easier by automating the steps. Anyway, you still have to unlock the bootloader, THEN install a custom recovery (CWM or similar), THEN rename the recovery files so the phone doesn&#8217;t automatically change them back on boot, THEN root, THEN you can finally install Mods. How&#8217;s that easier than other devices, exactly?<br />
Also, it&#8217;s extremely hard to permanently break your phone. As long as you can get back into recovery mode in some fashion, you can always redo the steps, and the stock ROMs are always easily accessible if you decide to backtrack for whatever reason.<br />
The source for Android, as an open product is always made available. True, the drivers and manufacturer skins are proprietary, but the source is always there, via the open-source license.<br />
Cyanogen, for instance, makes official mods for far more phones that are not Nexus versus the ones that are. They don&#8217;t do every phone, true, but it&#8217;s for the most part based on demand and feasibility, so if you research ahead of time and buy a major name brand phone, your chances are pretty good.</p>
<p>Jesus&#8230;. Verizon cannot even get there PDF correct&#8230;.. At the bottom of the PDF it says&#8230;</p>
<p> &quot; For step-by-step instructions on how to perform the download, please visit verizonwireless.com/galaxynexussupprt&quot; .</p>
<p>It should be &quot; verizonwireless.com/galaxynexussuppOrt &quot; . Forgot the &#8220;O&#8221; in support. Cant blame them really the guy who made the PDF was probably as excited as we are.</p>
<p>Ummm&#8230;. Settings&#8230; ummm&#8230;. About phone&#8230; and then&#8230; System updates&#8230; Check now&#8230;&#8230; nope, I ain&#8217;t got nothing.</p>
<p>Same here. Are you on the East Coast?</p>
<p>Im doing the same, but honestly they usually push them out at night. I usually wake up in the mornings and see the updates. Do bad you cant just push them yourself.</p>
<p>I just got it on my Rogers (Canada) GSM Gnex last week.  I hate how the updates are handled with the Gnex&#8230;. It was so much better on the Nexus S.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had 4.1 on my nexus from day one, and I knew verizon would do this, but i also knew the developers on rootz, xda,, droidforums, etc. would get me the updates before verizon ever would. :D</p>
<p>Posting from GA &#8211; still nothing.  Does anyone who has it have a review?  Working ok with the LTE?  Who am I kidding . . . I&#8217;ll download it regardless.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about god damn time!!</p>
<p>OMG COME ON WHERE IS IT. UPDATE BUTTON IS GONNA BREAK HITTING IT SO MUCH</p>
<p>Me too.  Even walked across the street from work to jump on WiFi.  Still no luck.  WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME VERIZON?!?!?  HAVE YOU NOT PUNISHED ME ENOUGH!?!?!</p>
<p>PUNISHMENT MUST CONTINUE TO COMMENCE!!! VERIZON&#8230;..WHERE ARE YOU NOW?!</p>
<p>Agree!  Been trying all day to no avail.  C&#8217;mon Verizon.</p>
<p>The fact that Verizon has any say in the matter really needs to change. I mean, way to nullify one of the main benefits of a nexus device&#8230;</p>

<p>Rolls out yesterday&#8230;still not seeing it today :/ Well I expect at this point it&#8217;ll still be a few weeks before I see it.</p>
<p>Hopefully it gets ported over to my phone.<img src="http://mastercleansesecretv.com/upload/30/happy.png" /></p>
<p>I still do not see it. anyone having the same issue?</p>
<p>I got my Jelly Bean update last night. Pretty Cool1</p>
<p>I received my Jelly Bean update this morning. Very nice! Love Google Now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the update seems to have affected my headphone jack&#8212;the audio signal no longer comes out. If I disconnect the audio cable, audio comes out of the internal speaker. I tried numerous audio cables and earbuds. Anyone else experience this problem?</p>
<p>About five hours later, the headphone jack is working now. Go figure.</p>
<p>I had terrible LTE reception issues with the Galaxy Nexus.  I had the same problem with two subsequent replacements.  The problem was that my LTE signal would drop out and kill my signal about twice an hour at random intervals.  This happened throughout southern California.  The 3G CDMA signal worked with no problem.</p>
<p>I just downloaded the Android 4.1.1 update from Verizon and have had a solid signal for over a day.  The software patch fixed my LTE reception issue.  I&#8217;m very pleased with the patch.</p>
<p>Even though this tablet sucks (I own one), you gotta give it to google for still giving it love by getting the updates.</p>
<p>Depends on how much you paid for it. It&#8217;s awesome for what I paid :)</p>
<p>I got mine the day the WiFi only version was released&#8230; I think I was like $599.99. Needless to say I now enjoy my iPad 3rd Gen and can wait to upgrade my GSM Galaxy Nexus to whatever the new Nexus device is later this year. iPad and Nexus, the best of both worlds! Kudos to Google for not forgetting about the Xoom even after they released the tablet they really wanted to in the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Kudos to Google for never giving  a crap about non American Xooms and leaving the UK Xoom on Honeycomb.</p>
<p>how about free with additional $125?</p>
<p>Mine was a gift :D</p>
<p>How does the Xoom suck? I got it when it first came out and I still use it often. Ever since it got ICS its been even faster than it was before. I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with the tablet at all.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with the tablet, everything wrong with the apps.</p>
<p>The number of apps in google play that are really good, super high quality tablet apps is pathetically small.</p>
<p>Well, there is one major thing wrong with the tablet &#8211; the battery life sucks. Or I should say, the standby time sucks.</p>
<p>I can leave my ipad 3 on standby (unplugged but not being used) for a week and lose maybe 20% of battery life. My Xoom will die in 48 hours whether its being used or not.</p>
<p>NOOOO! Now I can&#8217;t hold the fact that my Nexus 7 has JB over my Xoom owning roommate anymore!</p>
<p>And your Xoom owning Co-Worker</p>
<p>got my Xoom on day one when the WiFi was release. I still love my Xoom&#8230; Its rockin JB 4.1 now. TeaM EOS nightly.. I was going to buy the Nexus 7 but my Xoom is going to give me my $599.99 worth. if it last another year and can still play future games and apps. Job is complete. Thanks Motorola for my beautiful Xoom 64gb 1.5Ghz WiFi tab #Team Rooted</p>
<p>And my Gnex doesn&#8217;t even have JB yet&#8230;</p>
<p>At least we have LTE?</p>
<p>Damnit, I want JB.</p>
<p>I bought the MZ601 (32GB, WiFi+3G) in March for 300€ (new).<br />
It&#8217;s the first Android tablet but it&#8217;s still rockin with the official ICS release. It&#8217;s already smooth as butter but let&#8217;s wait for the JB release!<br />
Even it&#8217;s not the GED version it can be flashed on it every rom.</p>
<p>Oh, so now I have to shake the picture before it unlocks&#8230;</p>
<p>No you have to cut out the eyes and flash your hand behind it.</p>
<p>so now instead of just having a picture, you&#8217;ll need a .gif<img src="http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/3108/1337317350228.gif" /></p>
<p>if someone is willing to go through all that trouble just to unlock the phone, then i think the owner has other problems</p>
<p>This, and also Face unlock was never presented by Google as a secure technology. It is just an alternative unlocking system if you do not want to let your phone unlocked but do not want to have to input your pin each five minutes either.</p>
<p>Bet you were waiting a while to post this gif.</p>

<p>They say that she blinks at the same time that you do.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4oZ9t.jpg" /></p>
<p>The gif likely wouldn&#8217;t be good enough because the blink needs to occur when the phone instructs you to blink. You would need to have a blink animation that you could trigger at an arbitrary time.,</p>
<p>An animation that you can trigger at an arbitrary time? That sounds really really complicated. There&#8217;s no way anyone could do that.</p>
<p>Sorry, I must have missed the part where I suggested this was impossible or even difficult.</p>
<p>A lord of the rings subhead&#8230; this website has restored my faith in humanity.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather see the Doors of Durin, but it&#8217;s still cool.</p>
<p>No one ever thought what flipbook would become a hacking tool.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re making it harder and harder to unlock dead people&#8217;s phones.</p>
<p>Face Unlock is a gimmick. Yes, it&#8217;s quick, but it&#8217;s still slower and less reliable that the old trusty pattern lock. I played with it the first day I got my Galaxy Nexus, and then showed it once to a friend who asked about it. That is it.</p>
<p>If you are in good lighting face unlock can unlock the phone in fractions of a second. But most of the time it is a little slower, especially if you&#8217;re in the dark.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not slower than pattern unlock under the right conditions.</p>
<p>What we need is a passive security method so you can still access the slide unlock with the camera and google now additions. I want this face unlock to get so good and so power efficient that it is always checking and if it doesn&#8217;t recognise someone it requires a PIN. I shouldn&#8217;t even know it is doing it.</p>
<p>I imagine that&#8217;s what they are working towards and why not share their steps towards that goal while working on it?</p>
<p>The PIN is still a weak measure. Do you have any idea how greasy your friends&#8217; hands are? Take a look at anyone&#8217;s screen &#8211; 4 out of 5 times you can guess the unlock pattern just by looking at the smudges.</p>
<p>I like this passive + PIN idea. I always thought it would be cool if they integrated fingerprint scanners (like the kind HP and IBM have been putting in their laptops for years) into the power button, so when you go to wake up the phone it can scan your thumb.</p>
<p>The original Motorola Atrix had a fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>How is it a gimmick?  Google tells you that it is less secure than a pattern or pin.  But it is absolutely faster then either of them.  Mine unlocks instantaneously.</p>
<p>It is a gimmick because it is a feature that works, but not one that I would depends on. I never says it&#8217;s a gimmick due to it being less secure. I knew that from the very first day.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how people would say that it is not slower than pattern unlock. Perhaps your pattern is way too complicated ( i don&#8217;t see how complicated it can get with 9 points, though). But even in the best lighting condition, it is not faster. And then what with dim lighting? Wait for it to see if it work, and if not, unlock with pin/pattern? How is this convenience, and how is this quick? And I have to have the front facing camera pointing at my face everytime I unlock it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying it doesn&#8217;t work. It does, and it does well when it does. But it is not useful for getting past lock screen, something that you do a hell lot of times everyday and in very different lighting conditions throughout the day.</p>
<p>You must have a weird face because it works for everyone else.</p>
<p>Also google tell you in the help document which is the most sequre and when to use each one and they don&#8217;t even mention face unlock because it&#8217;s considered a work in progress.</p>
<p>I find it&#8217;s excellent under perfect conditions and lets face it, who carrys a picture you around anyways. The problem is whenever I am at a bar or anywhere that isn&#8217;t well lit I have problems. I also don&#8217;t like seeing my face staring back at me.</p>
<p>Just a side note pattern unlocks aren&#8217;t very (especially if you use all 9 points)  because of all the smudges on the screen. If you want something secure use a 6 number pin that has one number repeated twice or a password.</p>
<p>How is it faster? If you use pattern or pin for a while you become so accustomed to the motion that you can pull your phone out of your pocket, hit the lock switch and already have the pattern complete before you&#8217;ve even seen the phone. It becomes on fluid motion.</p>
<p>Face unlock is instaneous if you do it correctly in the right conditions</p>
<p>Because there&#8217;s nothing to get accustomed to.  As soon as you look at your phone, it&#8217;s unlocked.</p>
<p>With a pattern it&#8217;s unlocked before you&#8217;ve even brought it into a position to look at it. Also, your definition of &#8216;as soon&#8217; must be different from mine because even looking at the phone the delay was long enough that I&#8217;d be able to unlock it with other means faster.</p>
<p>Cut out the eyes from the photo, put this behind it and keep moving it so it looks like it&#8217;s blinking:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4OsZd.png" /></p>
<p>Oh crap, I&#8217;m a robot so Face Unlock won&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<p>This feature, and even PINs to an extent, are mostly to prevent the average stranger or friend from being nosey with your phone. Even if Face Unlock was perfect, someone could just plug the device into a PC and get your data that way.</p>
<p>the galaxy nexus, at least, has to be unlocked for it to be accessible thru windows explorer.</p>
<p>You, sir, get a cookie.</p>

<p>grammar fail *ate</p>
<p>I think that was intentional.</p>
<p>Cats do grammar good, that&#8217;s the point.</p>
<p>Wrong.  Cats do grammer good.</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t been on the internet long, have you?</p>
<p>Correct although there&#8217;s a backdoor through fastboot AFAIK</p>
<p>No. When you do oem unlock it wipes all your data exactly for this reason.</p>
<p>Unless you encrypt, which is an option of course, I&#8217;m pretty sure you can just boot into fast boot and hook it up to the computer and you&#8217;ve got file access. Pretty sure I&#8217;ve done it before</p>
<p>Next up in key lime pie, retina scan unlock? ;)</p>
<p>Be nice to have something. Even though google now is awesome I have started locking my phone because it&#8217;s a bit of a security risk if people can just easily see where I love and work if they get my phone, pattern and pin unlocks are annoying, wish there was something better.</p>
<p>Should have had that from the start</p>
<p>does it still take 5 seconds longer than just using an unlock pattern.</p>
<p>Under ideal conditions? No, but then again it never took 5 seconds longer under ideal conditions</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used it in a dark bar and it was instantaneous.  I&#8217;m willing to bet that you set it up once and took your picture in a bright light setting.  That&#8217;s not how it works.  You have to take multiple pictures in all different settings.  Once you do that, it works extremely fast.</p>
<p>I really want to see two front facing cameras, then they wouldn&#8217;t have this problem.</p>
<p>That&#8217;ll be on the Windows Phone 8 Kinect edition.</p>
<p>And if they do that, hope they also could implement something like lip reading. It would be really cool if you could write texts without disturbing anyone or using the keypad of course.</p>
<p>Would be cheaper and more reliable to do something sound based.</p>
<p>I take it you&#8217;ve never seen &#8216;The Fly&#8217; with Jeff Goldblum?</p>
<p>Nope I haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>make the phone request you to say a word, and use voice and face recognition.</p>
<p>The infamous /b/ meme of &#8220;put shoe on head&#8221; will be Google&#8217;s next security step.</p>
<p>Next security feature I want for my phone? How about the ability to turn it into a mini transformer? Or an armed guard!</p>
<p>They just need to license this<br />

<p>easy &#8211; follow an quick, random, onscreen dot animation with your gaze. combination of pupil movement and slight face movement should be able to confirm liveness.</p>
<p>Too time consuming</p>
<p>Is google saying while developing the face unlock thing, they didn&#8217;t know it could be fooled with a picture?</p>
<p>At least Tim Bray (Android&#8217;s Developer Advocate at Google) was adamant this impossible:</p>
<blockquote><strong>koush</strong> ‏@koush<br />
The face recognition unlock thing is really easily hackable. Show it a photo.<br />
<br />
<strong>Tim Bray</strong> @timbray<br />
@koush Nope. Give us some credit.</blockquote>

<p>LOL!! So they refuse to even test it, to know if it was possible. lol! Classic case of denial!</p>
<p>Having to take off my gloves AND shades to use my phone would get really annoying, fast. <br />
This is a nice twelve-year-old&#8217;s sci-fi fantasy gimmick, but nobody considered whether it would actually be useful in real life before going &#8220;Oh, cool!&#8221; and building it.</p>
<p>Now, they&#8217;re trying too hard to gold-plate a turd, because they can&#8217;t throw it out anymore.</p>
<p>Actually, it now lets you take multiple pictures (with and without glasses, beard etc.) so it can recognize you under different circumstances. So, it&#8217;s not a turd as you put so delicately, but rather a work in progress, getting better with each release. Have a little patience, no technology becomes perfect in one day.</p>
<p>Would you like to explain to me how a &#8220;liveness check&#8221; based on <strong>blinking</strong> will work with sunshades?</p>
<p>So like, and all I have to do is kill a guy, and take his phone to his face, and force his eyes open with my fingers and I unlock the it? Sure nbd</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus (w/ Jelly Bean)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem with face Unlock, No Matter the phone:</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t work when you&#8217;re not looking at it.  Like you can&#8217;t unlock it while it rests on your table. (Super Annoying)</p>
<p>If it is dark it does not work.  Do you use your phone early in the morning to check the time, an mid night email, set an alarm, etc..  Of course you do.  Face unlock will require you turning a light on your face.  Annoying.</p>
<p>It makes it very awkward when trying to glance at the phone when you&#8217;re driving too.  You can&#8217;t exactly hold the thing up in front of your face.</p>
<p>My point is separate to yours, however I&#8217;ve replied to yours to make the point that these are the exact reasons I don&#8217;t actually use face-unlock.</p>
<p>So, lets assume that we agree that face unlock isn&#8217;t that secure if you have a photo.</p>
<p>Who is breaking into your phone? The most likely reason someone is going to be breaking into my phone is if Joe Bloggs nicks it off the pub table, or something like that. Yes, loved ones and people I know are likely to be able to find a photo and unlock it, but I would like to think I can trust them anyway, and don&#8217;t actually care if they see anything on my phone.</p>
<p>For Joe Bloggs who nicks it from the table, He wont have any photos of me, especially passport-esque ones where I stare straight at him. He is much more likely to be able to read the grease prints from the phone and guess the pattern/pin than obtain a copy of my face.</p>
<p>And if you have stuff on the phone that neither of these are secure enough for, then put a proper password on, you also have that option.</p>
<p>I would love to use the face unlock, and the minor security quibbles with the latest iteration are good enough for me (especially with Cerberus as a back up). The only reason I <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> use it is the reasons Triangle lists above&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nice and all, but I want that $249 7-inch Tegra 3 tablet!!!</p>
<p>Amen that Memo looks amazing for the price</p>
<p>This plus the news that Majel is set for Q4 makes me really happy I got a Galaxy Nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>I never realized the desserts were in alphabetical order!</p>
<p>Yep. What I&#8217;m really curious about is what happens when they get to X?<br />
Luckily we won&#8217;t have to worry about it for another couple of years ;-)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise really. They accelerated version numbers with Chrome, and now they&#8217;re doing the same to Android. Pretty soon Android will start incrementing version numbers every few months, but even when Android 12.0 comes out we&#8217;ll still have a lot of people on 2.3.</p>
<p>They are not accelerating like Chrome. They said they would be doing one (or two) major updates a year, and it looks like they are keeping to that.</p>
<p>they wanted it to become once a year<br />
<a href="http://androidandme.com/2010/06/news/interviews/android-will-move-to-a-yearly-update-cycle/" target="_blank">http://androidandme.com/2010/06/news/interviews/android-will-move-to-a-yearly-update-cycle/</a></p>
<p>A lot of articles call Jelly Bean 5.0, but it could just be 4.1. Eclair/froyo/Gingerbread were all 2,.x releases but got names. ICS was such a significant update I can&#8217;t see the next one being another version number jump.</p>
<p>or, they&#8217;ll just go the chrome-way and start throwing the version-numbers around like I throw benjamins in the club&#8230;.</p>
<p>Nope, think about it this version of Android will be coming out at the same time as Windows 8 and just after Mountain Lion this will be a full release. Rumours are already talking about the death of Chrome OS so it can be rolled into Jelly Bean as desktop mode. Should be interesting.</p>
<p>This all makes sense. All of the other partners have seemed to have dropped the ball as far as pushing out updates, causing Google to have to make PR headlines (like the Upgrade Pledge) among other things. Samsung, Motorola, and other big name OEMs were a reasonable choice for flagship partners in the past given their size and stature, but Asus I think has earned themselves a shot at being the showcaser for the next version of Android. I remember how surprised I was that the hot Android tablet wasn&#8217;t the Samsung Galaxy Tab, but the Asus Transformer. They&#8217;ve really impressed not only with their innovative tablet concepts and hardware, but also with their aggressive upgrades to existing devices. At least as far as Tablets go, they&#8217;ve proved their mettle even when they weren&#8217;t the annointed ones. I&#8217;m not sure what else Google could ask for. Maybe lower-cost tablets? Well, wouldn&#8217;t that seem to fit right in with rumors of a Google branded tablet&#8230;just my conjecture.</p>
<p>Good for Asus, they&#8217;re like the only ones bright enough to keep almost stock android.</p>
<p>Asus is doing good with android phones! Good on them. I am excited to hear more about this</p>
<p>ASUS is amazing, and I will continue to buy any of their products for years to come.  The original Transformer was a work of art, just well designed inside and out.  The Prime while having some early software issues, they patched it up extremely quick, gave us ICS and an unlock tool, and everything works just wonderful now.  My first laptop 6 years ago was Asus and it still runs to this day now with Windows 8. My desktop computer I built with Asus motherboard because they are ultra reliable.  I&#8217;ve recommended Asus laptops to friends, and nobody who owns one has ever been disappointed.</p>
<p>I hope they truly are working with Google to release their next Nexus devices, this is a great partnership.</p>
<p>everyone can be like them if they start realising that android needs to stay as itself.<br />
Just like how you sell windows pc.<br />
Just only add customisations like applications, wallpapers and ringtones and everyone will be happy.</p>
<p>No launcher nonsense pls.</p>
<p>Which is why huawei updates are way faster.</p>
<p>I think they just sold me on a PadPhone.</p>
<p>But AFAIK, they started with Gingerbread. I don&#8217;t recall anything from Apple Pie through Fudge. Or am I out of it?</p>
<p>Android wasn&#8217;t given codenames until 1.5, which was Cupcake.</p>
<p>1.6 was Donut<br />
2.0/2.1 was Eclair<br />
2.2 was Froyo</p>
<p>Maybe Asus will be Google&#8217;s new hardware partners for the new Nexus phone running Jelly Bean?</p>
<p>Even better, they should be the ones to make the nexus tablet.</p>
<p>The Android love story, Google may have married Motorola but Asus is where his heart really is.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great but my transformer prime runs like shit.  It always gets hiccups when watching a movie or playin jelly defense.  ICS clearly hasn&#8217;t been optimized for the Tegra 3  and Asus should be directly responsible (not Nvidia) for improving performance.</p>
<p>Ugh, I need to get away from CDMA and Verizon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in exactly the same boat</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the same boat. If they can&#8217;t keep a Nexus phone up to date, they&#8217;re incapable of keeping any phone up to date. My next phone will not be with Verizon.</p>
<p>iPhones are kept up to date.  Maybe you need a new platform. ;-)</p>
<p>Not true, iOS 4.3 came out for GSM only and it brought features that the Verizon iPhone wouldn&#8217;t receive until iOS 5. It had me pissed off for months.</p>
<p>iPhones have iOS6?</p>
<p>I just went through EXACTLY the same frustration a few months ago and bought a factory unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexus from Expansys. After 3 months on AT&amp;T I sold it on eBay and bought a used Verizon Galaxy Nexus. I&#8217;m not making any blanket statements because I know AT&amp;T&#8217;s network is fantastic in some areas, but not mine. All I&#8217;m saying is be careful what you wish for because it bit me.</p>
<p>Same&#8230;really disappointed in Verizon&#8217;s handling of the Nexus brand. We&#8217;ll be looking elsewhere for our next phones.</p>
<p>Same&#8230;really disappointed in Verizon&#8217;s handling of the Nexus brand. We&#8217;ll be looking elsewhere for our next phones.</p>
<p>Sorry for the double post.</p>
<p>I feel the same way. Once AT&amp;T can match Verizon&#8217;s LTE coverage, I&#8217;ll bid CDMA good bye, I love Verizon&#8217;s coverage but hate everything about the way they do things. Just the word &#8216;Droid&#8217; makes me wish the collective Verizon could be formed in to a single person, so I could punch that person in the mouth.</p>
<p>not to be negative nancy but i thought Nexus device was a Nexus device no mater what carrier it was on. That was myth from hell, only if google said its super important that you have a carrier free nexus device before people spend there money on it.</p>
<p>If you paid attention to the Nexus S the cdma variants are always in the &#8216;i might be a nexus device on day but not the next&#8217; zone of google love.</p>
<p>No matter what carrier*, a Nexus is a Nexus.</p>
<p>*With exception to US carriers.</p>
<p>Canadian carriers are no better, the Galaxy Nexus&#8217; up here are all stuck on 4.0.2</p>
<p>We can flash takju/yakju. Yakjuux is a local variant, but Samsung Canada <em>might</em> pull their heads out their asses in the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on 4.0..1.</p>
<p>me too</p>
<p>*And Australian carriers.</p>
<p>Had to flash a different ROM to get updates and such. Which led me into Rooting etc which I have found to be a bit of a difficult mess. Probably worse because I was an early adopter so no real toolkits were out (and I use a Mac so it&#8217;s a pain to use them anyway).</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even have to bring carriers into the picture for the Nexus promise to fall apart. Depending on which country its sold in even unlocked and unsubsidized GSM Galaxy Nexus phones bought from independent retailers aren&#8217;t getting the updates on time or even straight from Google. Samsung is involved and &#8220;evaluates&#8221; each update for a couple of weeks or months before allowing it.</p>
<p>This is true. But you can flash the very image this story is about on such phones and you&#8217;re on Google&#8217;s update track from then on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m residing in Japan, and they rolled out JB to my Nexus S early this week. So for me, having a nexus device (unlocked) has been working out great (and I&#8217;m not seeing myself leaving the nexus program).</p>
<p>Why do us users prefer Verizon? From what I know, they are as bad as At&amp;t but you cannot get just any phone and use it.  I got my nexus and decided that if I ever buy another android device, it&#8217;s going to be a nexus.</p>
<p>Their service is generally more reliable .</p>
<p>LTE and they were first to offer the device.  Also, att has really bad service where I live</p>
<p>They have better coverage, real 4G, and a lot fewer dropped calls.</p>
<p>Oh, don&#8217;t forget grandfathered unlimited data.</p>
<p>Because HSPA is no substitute for LTE, and Verizon is plastering the country with LTE coverage. But everything else Verizon does is the devil&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>These is different from the AOSP images?</p>
<p>I would think to a slight degree yes, as these are the specific images for the specific device. Little to no variation I would think, but I havent comapred them so I wouldnt know for sure.</p>
<p>Mainly allows you to return to stock (as in new purchase of the device) with ease.</p>
<p>AOSP is just source. If you compile AOSP, you get to the open source version of Android which lacks Google apps. You can flash Gapps zips available around the internet, which will take you close to these factory images, but still you&#8217;ll be a few steps down (boot animation, etc)</p>
<p>These are compiled source specifically for these devices, including kernel, driver, etc.</p>
<p>Verizon Galaxy Nexus won&#8217;t get Jelly Bean for another 3 months. Just watch.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just hoping the image for it gets updated here soon</p>
<p>Just unlock/root/ &amp; go ahead &amp; throw JB on there. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve done. I&#8217;ve had JB for several weeks now. Google Now is creepy in its accuracy, but I haven&#8217;t had any real problems with JB so far.</p>
<p>Canadian Gnex owners are in the same boat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m telling ya, having a GSM Nexus is the best thing ever. My next phone will be whatever GSM Nexus comes out.</p>
<p>I used to be a Nexus One guy&#8230; then jumped T-Mobile for Verizon. Lesson learned&#8230; If I want to be in the careful hands of Google, then I have to BUY DIRECT from Google&#8230;</p>
<p>I just wish Tmobile didn&#8217;t suck in my area. ATT is no better. Verizon does have a decent network but I guess I should rethink whether I use the Gnex as an actual phone anymore.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me Tmobile slaughters AT&amp;T in NYC.</p>
<p>True, I&#8217;ve had some great experiences w/ Tmobile in other areas than where I actually live. Used to get 15 down in Atlanta. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t live there. :(</p>
<p>Why is Google even waiting on Verizon before posting the image on their site? Google needs to pull rank and upload the cdma image this is bs. If Verizon doesn&#8217;t want to push the update that this their problem. Google should contract to have these phones built to spec with gsm and cdma built in. Screw the carriers and their in ability to push out upgrades&#8230;.I mean come on Verizon it&#8217;s a stock build.</p>
<p>Decided to flash the unofficial cm10 preview build and could not be happier. No issues so far been running a few hours.</p>
<p>With this particular image that has been released, does it have the full 4.1 unified search, or has this been removed?</p>
<p>IT&#8217;s a VERGE WARR!! . . .</p>
<p>THE VERGE KOMBAT!</p>
<p>thanks to Google Voice Search and Google Now (Jelly Bean) Gnex is actually the best phone now.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8ePUYp6HPU" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8ePUYp6HPU</a></p>

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDsOtdRtG0Q" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDsOtdRtG0Q</a></p>
<p>&#8230;and Android win :)</p>
<p>considering the $349 Gnex price tag&#8230; this phone is double better ;)</p>
<p>This.  It&#8217;s not cutting edge?  Neither is the price.  And it still runs everything.</p>
<p>And runs it first.  I&#8217;ve never been happier with a gadget purchase.  Love the Gnex.</p>
<p>Gnex was definitely the best Android phone when it was released, which is when I got it. If I was out of contract now, I would still either get the Galaxy Nexus (which is a bargain now), or just wait until the next Nexus is released. When will the GSIII get Jelly Bean? What about Key Lime Pie? The hardware boost just isn&#8217;t worth the 18 months of frustration.</p>
<p>My advice is to align your contract with Nexus release dates around November time. Then the question doesn&#8217;t even come up. When you&#8217;re in the market for a phone, the Nexus will be one of the best in terms of hardware, and THE best in terms of UX and OS updates.</p>
<p>I bought mine in May.  My plan is to get one every year, at 6 months old, if it&#8217;s around $400.  I&#8217;m okay with a 6 month old phone.  I save so much on T-Mobile non contract plans, I can justify a phone a year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with you on this. I got the HTC One S for $450 &amp; still come out way cheaper on Tmo. The HSPA+ speed is great where I live. I was a tough call between this phone &amp; at the Gnex.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t lie. We know you buy a new phone every year because you are loaded. :-P</p>
<p>No, T-Mobile has unsubsidized plans where you pay less monthly but have to buy your own phone. Amazing value.</p>
<p>Ha, he&#8217;s just messing with me.</p>
<p>No, T-Mobile has unsubsidized plans where you pay less monthly but have to buy your own phone. Amazing value.</p>
<p>I only hope that one day I can be like you and get a new one every couple weeks :)</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t these the same people who said that the GSIII&#8217;s day to day performance wasn&#8217;t that substantial enough to trade up from a gnex.  And by the time apps really begin to take advantage of the new power the new nexus will have come out anyway.</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;d say that now especially with Jelly Bean that&#8217;s all the more apparent. With the exception of video games, the Galaxy Nexus at the very least feels much faster than any ICS phone by comparison. Benchmarks be damned. Day to day use, Jelly Bean is just so much smoother than the previous upgrade, regardless of it&#8217;s outdated processor.</p>
<p>At this point, unless games are important to you on your phone, the biggest thing the GS3 has is a better camera. Which is great and all, but you use that so much less than everything else on your phone. The Gnex camera is pretty good still, very fast, just not incredible.</p>
<p>But the GS3 will get JellyBean pretty soon, thanks to CyanogenMod, now that the sources are out. I&#8217;d reckon we&#8217;ll have it by the end of the week.</p>
<p>But you have to root, and hack, and go out of your way to install a third party nightly ROM with a million bugs.</p>
<p>You are very optimistic! Not saying you are inherently wrong in your statement but at the <strong>most</strong> you will have a CM10 nightly by the end of the week. Not full release or even RC. That means there may well be bugs.</p>
<p>with touchjiz? no thanks</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is great and all, but you use that so much less than everything else on your phone. &quot;</p>
<p>Speak for yourself. I use the camera on my phone constantly. Since I got my Xperia Arc in March 2011, I&#8217;ve taken over 5000 pictures. The camera is a BIG selling point for me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s cool, the Gnex camera is great too. I still think the Gnex is the better value.</p>
<p>exactly what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>Truthfully due to the software on the Galaxy S3 as well as the &#8216;&#8217;MUCH BETTER HARDWARE&#8217;&#8217; even thou it&#8217;s Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 I will say it&#8217;s just as smooth with the Galaxy Nexus with jellybean. So in my book it only proves that when the Galaxy S3 gets jellybean it will be &#8216;&#8217;MILES AHEAD&#8217;&#8217; the Galaxy Nexus. Matter of fact when the NEXT NEXUS in November comes out that device alone will TRUMP the current Galaxy Nexus with jellybean. The only selling point right at this moment is that the current Nexus has jellybean GSM version anyway. Regardless it will be awhile before any device on the market TOPS the Galaxy S3.</p>
<p>I think the next Gnex is going to be Quad Core with LTE.  The reason why the Korean model of the GS3 has a Quad Core w/LTE is because the LTE Radio is separate from the Processor.</p>
<p>Yes the GS3 w/JB will be a very nice phone but spec wise the next GNex will be beast.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t need to be cutting edge. Apple realized long ago, your hardware is only as good as the software it runs. They seem to have forgotten that lately (or they&#8217;re waiting for new hardware).<br />
Google finally knows this thanks to the amazing talent they have in-house (the silver lining to the demise of Palm and WebOS).</p>
<p>Not only does it run it, but it runs it better than the GS3 or One X dream of doing. Better Specs stops at just that if the software is holding it back. I take Vlad&#8217;s side of this as I would much rather have the latest and greatest software over hardware any day. Now if this was a huge difference like say the Nexus S and the GS3 and One X then I could possibly see what your saying (actually now that I think about it I would really have to take a step back and think again). Chris talks about giving the Nexus class a pass what about TouchWiz and Sense (hey I am actually really glad that no one brought up the crap that Moto is passing off as an OS or hardware) are doing as Android. Android is what you make it and if being always outdated and always waiting for updates is ok by having 2gb of RAM rather than 1 (I really cant see another difference between the Nexus and GS3 besides that) then that is on you.</p>
<p>I had the chance to run the three phones side by side this weekend and I have to say Project Butter and JB completely obliterate the GS3 and One X in fluidity so you tell me how specs matter when they really dont matter. Software will always be where it is at and after last year and constantly waiting for updates I will continue to love my stock Android anyday.</p>
<p>Last point is the overall look and feel of the OS&#8217; we are talking about today. ICS and JB are about minimalism and they look and feel great. Chris thinks Nexus fans are in 2011, but I think that if we were in 2011 this would be much easier as skins actually added something to the bland and very old outdated feel of GB, but Google and Matias Duarte have changed that and the OEMs are still in 2011 being that their skins still look much like GB. So I would argue that thinking this is ok is giving the OEMs an out and free pass and them denying the beauty of Android now after having the Duarte touch is something I am not ready to do anytime soon.</p>
<p>In closing if Google chooses to not update the Nexus line and all these rumors are not true about numerous Nexii phones on the very near horizon and these OEMs start putting out next gen phones then I will agree and start to make the decision on if the specs justify me leaving the stock Android experience of the Galaxy Nexus. As of now there is nothing exciting about the hardware of the GS3 and One X and putting up with sorry software and no update to JB in the near future is not worth the trade off. We are talking about the same gen of phones here and nothing about these two phones screams upgrade right now.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be waiting as long for JB as we were for ICS.. in that case I&#8217;d rather wait a few extra months and get the better hardware. Not to mention that ICS is great in itself so I&#8217;m not exactly &#8216;missing out&#8217; on much.</p>
<p>Yeah you probably didn&#8217;t run the GS3 with the jelly bean transition mod or tweaked kernel. My GS3 runs circles around the GNex. Oh and lets not forget LTE, better hardware (screen, camera, removable battery, expandable memory), Touchwiz actually has software not found on Vanilla Android (Motion, Camera features,  etc.). And I have the American variation. I can only imagine how that quad core is doing.</p>
<p>And if you use the 2GB enough, Android will keep more Apps open without closing them, so you just start back to where u were. My GS3 has already gone over 1GB usage quite a few times with heavy use.</p>
<p>So really the only update worth mentioning (Although the 4.1 update is very nice), is Google Now.</p>
<p>4.1 is a nice update. But it really only gives the 9 month old GNex a fighting chance against the new heavy hitters. It&#8217;s a waste of money to buy one now. GS3 or HTC One X are better investments.</p>
<p>Google should have had a new Galaxy phone at their I/O, but i&#8217;m expecting the new one will have Key Lime Pie. Now that will be worth talking about.</p>
<p>The American variant is actually faster than the quad core in a lot of things (in fact, most things) because most android apps don&#8217;t really utilize all 4 cores well.  Right now the Krait version with the 2GB of RAM is actually the faster version for most people.</p>
<p>Most apps use 4 cores already so I don&#8217;t see what you are getting at? The international SGS3 is the fastest device out there right now, and is going to get even faster once CyanogenMod releases JB for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d probably still rather have my Nexus S over a Galaxy S III simply because software support directly from the Google mothership and because I&#8217;m so in love with the ICS&#8217;s Holo UI. Very interested to see how Project Butter runs on the Nexus S specs since it&#8217;s fully optimized for ARMv7.</p>
<p>Have you heard about CM or AOKP?</p>
<p>The cutting edge argument makes me laugh. In teh scope of things a GS3 and GN are not that far off in real world performance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like arguing that your $500 Pentium 3 800Mhz is so much better than my Pentium 3 350Mhz. In a year neither are &#8220;cutting edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re comment is misguided. If anything it&#8217;s more like an 800 MHz p3 vs a 3.0 Ghz P4.</p>
<p>Not really.  Both are on the A9 architecture.</p>
<p>Whoops I posted and could not edit.</p>
<p>I wanted to add in real world performance I feel that the One X and SGS 3 offer better displays, better ergonomics, better quality cameras with more features (it&#8217;s well known the GN camera isn&#8217;t high end) and I have a feeling updates will be pushed out faster, HTC is known for it at least. The added features and faster hardware will tide over consumers until the updates come.</p>
<p>I think the SGS3 and the Gnex share the same display.</p>
<p>Pretty sure the whole Nexus vs OEMs is just a subset of Android vs Apple. People love to justify their purchase by strongly defending it online.</p>
<p>I got a One X despite it&#8217;s stupid multitasking because I&#8217;d rather have a beautiful screen, decent camera on hand and LTE than Jelly Bean. But that&#8217;s just me defending my choice isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Hey, what&#8217;s this &#8220;self-awareness&#8221; bullshit! Not on my internet!!</p>
<p>You owe me a mouthful of coffee!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a terrible troll. <strong>hangs head in shame</strong></p>
<p>Maybe a little bit, but I first bought a skinned Android phone, got frustrated with it, and then made a conscious decision to buy a Nexus next time. I think a lot of people who advise buying a Nexus have followed a similar pattern. To my mind that&#8217;s learning from past mistakes, not justifying them.</p>
<p>The One X looks great, and if had to pic one skinned phone now then that would be it. But I just know that for most of the life of my contract I&#8217;d be frustrated at not having the latest Android version.</p>
<p>One X will probably get Jelly Bean anyways, just a little later.  Other than that, the choice between that and the S3 is really just which one you prefer: TouchWiz, or Sense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m right there with you dude. Jelly Bean is a decent update, but the hardware of the GS3 is soooo much better. And Touchwiz has some nice software features Vanilla Android doesn&#8217;t!</p>
<p>I have another 38 days to return my GS3, and I see absolutely no reason to do so.</p>
<p>When the new GNex comes out, that will make me consider selling the GS3. Especially if Key Lime Pie is on it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry to much about that there is no way that Key Lime Pie will be on the NEXT NEXUS in November. I am happy with my Galaxy S3 on Tmobile and I should know I already had the Verizon Galaxy Nexus and gladly sold it and left Verizon for Tmobile. My current Galaxy S3 on Tmobile works in all areas my Verizon Galaxy Nexus never did. And to be honest the speed on my HSPA PLUS 42mbps network of tmobile PIMP SLAPS Verizon and it&#8217;s battery draining LTE network. We won&#8217;t even get into the poor reception/signal strenght that exist on the Verizon Galaxy Nexus which made me altogether get away from CDMA devices. My Galaxy S3 on Tmobile &#8216;&#8217;RUNS RINGS&#8217;&#8217; aroung the Verizon Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>I hate google!&#8230;. I paid 600 on Canadian launch day&#8230;. and now it is worth 1/2 as much&#8230;. total outrage!&#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s okay. They don&#8217;t sell the phone in Canada for $350 anyways. All the carriers still have it listed for $600 or more! I guess you could buy it off one of those American resellers or eBay, but that&#8217;s still going to be more than $350.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever wins&#8230; we lose.&#8221; -Nokia/RIM</p>
<p>Nokia still theoretically could come back, whenever they decide to build a top class android phone.  They have the ability to, they just choose not to.  RIM, well&#8230; ya, they&#8217;re screwed.</p>
<p>Nokia isn&#8217;t dead, and Windows Phone is a fantastic OS, which also isn&#8217;t dead. You will be eating your words in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft has been preaching &#8220;wait until the next update &#8230;&#8221; for nearly two years now. While I would be the first to admit that Windows phone may earn the title as a credible option to Android or Apple, the fact remains that this is not the future, and as of today, it is not; neither in app availability, consumer adoption, hardware specs nor o.s. feature set.</p>
<p>The future may be filled with; puppy dogs, 20 yr old Scotch that flows like Newcastle at happy hour and Windows phone mobile supremacy; but in the here and now, it does not!</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 is a credible option in every way except consumer adoption.</p>
<p>By your definition, so are: WebOS, Symbian and BB9/10. All of which have equal or greater market adoption than Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Also, Windows Phone 8 is not on the market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give Windows Phone 1 YEAR after Windows 8 comes out this fall. After that, if it still can&#8217;t make a dent I&#8217;ll declare it dead. Key Lime Pie and the new Nexus at the 2013 I/O will basically destroy Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>Haha, I&#8217;m a new AT&amp;T employee, thus I received the standard issue Lumia 900, I personally have a HTC Amaze, and seriously. The Amaze (which is considerably older) has a faster processor, better camera, and runs the apps that I need. The Lumia, although beautiful hardware-wise, is half baked and a terrible device day-to-day&#8230; I guess it&#8217;s a decent device to recommend to first-time smartphone users, but by no means even decent for power-users.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve recently been thinking of Ebaying my Amaze and buying a GNex just so I can have JB, Wallet, and a stock experience, plus a guaranteed upgrade to the next version of Android. I know that the camera is better on the Amaze, and the CPU is actually probably slightly more powerful, but the experience sucks.</p>
<p>Meh, and to go on about my second paragraph, the source for the ICS kernel for the released Telus ICS software just went live, so maybe I&#8217;ll stay on the Amaze and hope for CM9/10 as the hardware is really good (even if the 1750mah battery sucks)</p>
<p>Nokia is running out of money and laying off people left and right. Windows Phone 7 is loosing marketshare. <br />
Wait for the next version is what Microsoft said when they where working on Windows mobile 6.5 then they said Windows Phone 7 would be great&#8230; Then they wait for Tango. Well now every one is saying WP8 will be great&#8230; Well Microsoft has Osborned Nokia and killed it.  <br />
Nobody should buy a Lumia today in fact no one should buy any Windows Phone today because they will not run WP8! If you are thinking of a Windows Phone you should just wait right? I mean you will be in a two year contract with a phone that can not run the new hot OS&#8230;.<br />
BOOM! hello near zero sales for the carriers, developers, and OEMs until WP8 ships. HTC and Samsung are fine since they will keep making money on their Android Phones. Nokia better hope that S40 phones sell like hotcakes.</p>
<p>People just need to realize this, and I&#8217;m sure in maybe 5 years or so we&#8217;ll see that iOS is going the way of the condor. Outside of Game Center, better games, a better designed App Store, and better hardware, I don&#8217;t see a single thing that makes iOS better.</p>
<p>The biggest factor, I think, with people is that the iPhone is so popular, and there is only one to choose from. Google needs to start running TV ads for the Nexus all the time.</p>
<p>I think the only items in favour of the iPhone is ease-of-use, app ecosystem and hardware design.</p>
<p>Those are all things that Android is improving all the time, and I think we&#8217;re not far from parity between the two platforms.</p>
<p>Personally, I really dislike Samsung&#8217;s hardware design for anything other than their Nexus devices. Add the fact it&#8217;s got TouchWiz and limited update support and the SIII is a complete turn-off for me.</p>
<p>I agree for the most part, although other than the app tray, I don&#8217;t see how iOS devices are easier to use. They both pretty much work in the same way, except that for many Android is so much more easy to use that it might be confusing. i.e. Google Music doesn&#8217;t need to sync your songs with wires, and you can install or uninstall apps without having your phone near you at all.</p>
<p>When I say &#8220;easier&#8221; I mean you don&#8217;t have to even go into the app tray to get to your apps. I don&#8217;t mind it, but I think others might</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a variety of things that are much more user intuitive on the iPhone. For instance, I just bought a Galaxy Nexus that arrived today – trying to migrate my data from my Nexus S is absurdly difficult. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m required to root and backup that way, or to use ADB and do a full backup that way. With the iPhone, iCloud makes a reliable up-to-date backup that is an exact replication if I get a new device.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a myriad of small things that the iPhone makes much easier, especially to inexperienced users.</p>
<p>what the hell are you talking about?!?!?</p>
<p>Contacts, pics, calendar, music, apps, sms (with google voice)&#8230; its all backed up or can be through google either automatically or manually??  the ONLY thing you wont get backed up automatically is your app data, which you have to be rooted to back up&#8230; but go ahead and try to get that on an iphone.</p>
<p>What are YOU talking about? iCloud makes a full backup. App data is the biggest reason to have such a back up! Of course your contact/cal/music are backed up, that stuff is all account-based. You log in and there you go. Not everyone uses Google voice. Hell, it isn&#8217;t even available outside the States so your point there is absolutely moot. I have used both, and I can say that it used to be truly novel that your apps start downloading on a new android device when you log into your Google account, but Google does NOT have a full-backup and restore solution the way Apple does. I&#8217;m not saying that one platform is better than the other for this feature, just clarifying that way it actually works on both platforms.</p>
<blockquote> I’m not saying that one platform is better than the other for this feature, just clarifying that way it actually works on both platforms.</blockquote>
<p>Oh, I&#8217;d say Apple have got this one right. App data should be backed up to the cloud along with everything else. If I lose my device, I should be able to make an exact replica of the missing device.</p>
<p>On a similar note, Android lacks remote locking/wipe or location tracking for devices without the use of a third party tool like Lookout –  that&#8217;s another iCloud feature that really needs to come to Android.</p>
<p>I do wish Android backed up app data.</p>
<p>Other than that, I&#8217;m happy with the platform.</p>
<p>Remote wiping would be nice too, but at least I encrypted my phone.</p>
<p>remote wiping apps exist.</p>
<p>Through iCloud you can remote while your phone. With find my iPhone.</p>
<p>since this article is about the Galaxy Nexus vs the Galaxy S3 (in essence)&#8230;for the record&#8230;remote wiping and location/tracking in native to TouchWiz&#8230;.another reason for the Galaxy S3</p>
<p>Yeah, but I was talking about a native feature in the OS.</p>
<p>Native to Galaxy S3</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult because app data can be scattered across the internal memory or the SD card.</p>
<p>With Android you can remotely install one of these apps and then do it. With iOS you have to have it set up and installed first. It doesn&#8217;t make sense for everyone to have to set it up first in case your phone is stolen or lost. I don&#8217;t want any unnecessary stuff on my phone.</p>
<p>true&#8230;but what about setting up the app?? Most apps need to be setup before you can use them to wipe a phone right?? or is there a remote wipe app that doesn&#8217;t need to be setup?</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lookout.labs.planb&feature=more_from_developer#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEwMiwiY29tLmxvb2tvdXQubGFicy5wbGFuYiJdj" target="new">Plan B</a></p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidlost&feature=related_apps" target="new">Android Lost</a></p>
<p>Setup what? Find my iPhone? Which should be &#8220;Find My Device&#8221; since it covers iPod touch, iPad, iPhone, Mac&#8217;s no longer needs anything to be installed or setup.</p>
<p>When you get your new device and it walks you through the process you simply click the option. In the settings app you can turn it on and off. There is no need for standalone app since iOS 5.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never tried it, but since you can install apps without touching your phone, I&#8217;d say all the remote wipe apps for android do just fine, even if you don&#8217;t think to install them before you lose your phone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you need to set the app up beforehand, making that feature useless.</p>
<p>there is an app in the market called plan b, you download it from the play store after you&#8217;ve lost your phone.</p>
<p>that being said if you&#8217;re prepared you can download an app called cerberus which can track the calls and texts of the user of your phone, allows you to record them talking, take pictures of them and SO much more along with obvious mapping and wiping. (works even with changed sim card+wipe+turned off data)</p>
<p>Wow. What Cerberus makes possible is much more illegal in the US than stealing the phone is.</p>
<p>Copying SD card contents to another phone is not rocket science.</p>
<p>Not all apps can use the SD card for data storage, nor allow you just to drag their data on to another device.</p>
<p>Android does, its been in since 2.2, but app developers have to hook into the service and many just don’t…</p>
<p>iCloud creates a verbatim backup of all data, including app data. If you backup one iPhone and restore it to another device, they&#8217;re practically identical. There&#8217;s no requirement to root (or jailbreak) in order to get that back on a new device – there&#8217;s seemingly no way to make an exact copy of a device on Android.</p>
<p>Provided you use the iCloud.  I do not as I have various serious concerns over the TOU.   In the future I wont be able to anyway,. as I also use this phone for work, new work security rules precludes iCloud backup for anything other than basic Apps.   For my Android phone, I do not have those restrictions &#8211; I also use this for work.</p>
<p>Even without using iCloud, you can still use iTunes (and its Wi-Fi sync feature) to create a local encrypted backup of a device that can be transfered as a verbatim copy to another device. The verbatim element is the thing that Android natively lacks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably less problematic to do so when you don&#8217;t have different devices. Every iPhone is virtually the same, the tradeoff is that you don&#8217;t have the freedom to get something different like you do on the Android platform.</p>
<p>Yes, if there&#8217;s any reasonable excuse for Android lacking such an integral feature, it&#8217;s the deluge of devices. Even so, there&#8217;s little reasoning that it can&#8217;t be a feature for the Nexus handsets.</p>
<p>Its called a reason, not a reasonable excuse. Android isn&#8217;t about Nexus devices. If it can&#8217;t be done for all devices, there&#8217;s no point.</p>
<p>Actaully I would call this an excuse. Unreasonable excuse. App data should have nothing to do with the type of hardware as long as the same OS is supported on this hardware. I can backup my app data on one PC and move it to any other PC with no problems.</p>
<p>on PC, it depends. If its all in the program folder, its easy. How about registry, how do you transfer that? It would get more complicated then.</p>
<p>The task may be easy or not too easy depending on the OS structure (e.g registry vs /usr/lib) but there is absolutely no excuse not to have a app data backup due to differences in <em>hardware</em> as long as the same OS is installed.  If it&#8217;s too hard for Google due to a messy structural design of linux/android then, i&#8217;m sorry, this is just lame. It&#8217;s 21st century go God&#8217;s sake</p>
<p>App data&#8230;your getting in a hissy fit over app data! When you login in to your Google account on a new android device your previous app&#8217;s download. As for data&#8230;.is it hard for me to spend 5 mins setting up my apps? No. I might have to login to Facebook and Twitter again&#8230;.Oh no, big deal, and I might have to change a few settings in some apps&#8230;.so what? If I&#8217;m really that bothered I can backup app data using Titanium Backup with Root access. And let&#8217;s be honest, if your talking about app data etc, you must know what rooting is.</p>
<p>Game progress, buddy!</p>

<p>&gt;is it hard for me to spend 5 mins setting up my apps?</p>
<p>Well, this only shows that you are not a heavy user. I agree, it this only a matter of logging to FB then yes, nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>P.S. I know what rooting is. And, you know, I remember how MBR looks in hexed ;-)</p>
<p>OK I doubt anyone will see this now, but Android does backup and restore app data.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinypic.com/r/25j9u15/6" target="_blank">http://tinypic.com/r/25j9u15/6</a></p>
<p>As pointed out above<br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/9/3146548/galaxy-nexus-jelly-bean-android-ping-counterping#107759864" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/9/3146548/galaxy-nexus-jelly-bean-android-ping-counterping#107759864</a><br />
Android does actually provide an api for this. The limitation is simply that apps need to support it (skimming the docs for it makes it sound straight forward to implement). That I think is a reasonable requirement when dealing with a wide variety of hardware and file system setups.</p>
<p>The nexus handsets really should get this feature&#8230; :)</p>
<p>Not sure if that really is an issue.  When you change devices what do you expect to transfer from one device to the next?  I find it simpler on Android as I run into too many apps on iOS that are tied to the UDID.  App transfers, data does but fails on app launch.  :(</p>
<p>Agree you can and that is my current method.  The only problem I have is I have two iTunes accounts, one work, one family and the phone carries both.  As I travel a lot this becomes a pain.  But yes, it is another option.  Thx.</p>
<p>You should let my iPad, Pod, and Phone know this&#8230;I swear I can&#8217;t get those three on the same page&#8230;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to do anything. It is in the cloud already. Besides, if you had to, just connect it to your computer and access the data from any OS, whereas with iPhone you need iTunes.</p>
<p>No you can access everything through iCloud.com on any computer. Contract calander and all.  When you first set up your iPhone you set up iCloud by tapping yes and it will backup whenever you charge your device.</p>
<p>Have you even used iOS before?  I&#8217;m guessing no.</p>
<p>No offense but why are you fanboys/girls chiming in about IOS here?</p>
<p>This a discussion about the Nexus vs. other Android phones. Not another meaningless IOS vs. Android romp.</p>
<p>andriod &#8220;fanpeople&#8221; brought it up&#8230;.. they&#8217;re just defending themselves</p>
<p>For next years Nexus model, they should only dress it in a metal casing. Then it&#8217;s game over. The Nexus of now is so beautiful that I had to get one and get a second line, just to buy out the contract, so I can go back and forth between my iPhone 4. There is ONE app that keeps me with the iPhone&#8230;Awesome Note, can&#8217;t find anything like it in the play store.</p>
<p>A full metal body would be nice, but it leads to problems with the antennas. ASUS experienced this issue on their tablets and now includes a plastic strip on the back of their new ones where the wifi and GPS antennas are located.</p>
<p>I want the &#8220;driving gloves&#8221; on the back &#8211; like the Nexus 7. That&#8217;s where it&#8217;s at.</p>
<p>Glass is the material to <strong>not</strong> make the back out of &#8211; I mean &#8230; duhhhh.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve stuck with the iPhone because of iCloud and the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>Now that Android so far outclasses the iPhone, I&#8217;m actually annoyed enough and wanting the new features enough to consider moving away from the iPhone, and getting myself a droid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside of Game Center, better games, a better designed App Store, and better hardware, I don’t see a single thing that makes iOS better.&#8221;</p>
<p>What else is there?</p>
<p>Shh, he things asides of MOST OF WHAT A MODERN SMARTPHONE STANDS FOR being better on the iphone (according to him) doesn&#8217;t make it the better platform.</p>
<p>I think there is space for both, and i think WP will come a a third closing the &#8220;big three&#8221; market into something like the console market has been for the last ten years. A couple of years dominated by one player, then another takes place, back and forth.</p>
<p>Sometimes new features will be the top consideration, and google will be the top dog in that respect most of the time. Except when Apple pulls an &#8220;iphone 4&#8221; where it adds so many stuff in a really well designed package that people simply cannot resist it.</p>
<p>MS I see being just there, bringing new stuff to the table but at a slower pace, still offering a more stable UX device wise (across all current devices) but still offering choices for it&#8217;s users. I think with nokia&#8217;s expertise, the midrange smartphone market will be WP&#8217;s best bet.</p>
<p>I see it this way. In the uber smartphone bleeding edge tech market, Android will dominate. The high end will be split probably 40/50/10 (ios/android/wp) and the midrange will be something like 40/15/45 ios/android/wp).</p>
<p>He thinks&#8230; u.u</p>
<p>How is iOS going to be high end and midrange? They only make one model.  If they are going to be high end, then I would venture to guess that android and wp would dominate the midrange device category.  I can&#8217;t see any future where android has a mere 15 percent of the midrange market.</p>
<p>Because they continue to sell one generation back (not that I think it will happen, but that is how it is possible).</p>
<p>And their one generation back phone is going to comprise 40% of total sales against current gen phones?</p>
<p>A lot of people have gotten an iPhone 4 (eschewing the 4S) because it was considerably well priced, and still a great value even though it&#8217;s not as current hardware.</p>
<p>40% ?</p>
<p>1. The numbers by the OP are percentages of mid-range/high-end. They need not have any relation to eachother.</p>
<p>2. It is incredibly common for 1-2 generation old tech to outsell by several times the current generation. Multiple times is not going to happen with cell phones, but I could see the last generation selling 2 to 1 vs the current generation.</p>
<p>Are you actually saying Android will be that much weaker than iOS in the mid-range? That&#8217;s ridiculous. The number of &#8220;feature phone plus&#8221; faux-smartphones that are sold with older versions of Android must at least match, if not outsell the expensive cutting(/bleeding)-edge Android  devices, surely? I though that&#8217;s where Android got most of their market share.</p>
<p>Are you John Cleese, by any chance?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7HmhrgTuQ&feature=youtube_gdata_player" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7HmhrgTuQ&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>
<p>I have to say I 100% disagree. After dumping the 3Gs for the Nexus One two and half years ago the poor tablet experience brought me back to iOS and it is a completely different OS. Not to mention it runs much better (even at lower specs which honestly I dont think any Android phone right now blows the doors off the 4s right now outside of LTE). iOS has made a huge stride and in my opinion was the OS to get up until JB. Android is still just playing catch up and OEMs are even further behind.</p>
<p>For now JB with project butter (in my opinion the single biggest thing the android team has done to android since its inception) and Google Now have caught Android up to iOS and since I can enjoy the bigger display and LTE I am back to using my Nexus as my daily phone.</p>
<p>I dont see how you can call iOS as just holding on. Yes, the Nexus is great and JB has got me excited about Android again (just ordered a Nexus 7 last week too and I wasnt ever going to get rid of my Galaxy Nexus), but Android has a long way to go. It is no where near iOS in apps and won&#8217;t be probably ever. When have you seen a quality app come out for android and not iOS, but there are plenty that come on iOS and keep Android fans waiting. Android has no where near the music experience and Google Play is years behind iTunes I think everyone can see that. Apple will always be the market leader and that is because they are selling to normal consumers. Do I want to see that change? Sure I do, but in reality it wont. Dont fool yourself. The Android team is doing an excellent job, but they are not even close to catching up to the behemoth iPhone and even bigger iPad anytime soon.</p>
<p>Yeah; aside from more and better games and apps, a better app store, better hardware (design?).. you know, all the shit people care about, iOS will eventually go the way of the condor.</p>
<p>Or MAYBE! Maybe, this hodgepodge of update hell and fractured user experience governed by carrier interest will collapse on itself?</p>
<p>Who knows?!</p>
<p>Believe it or not, superiority between iOS and Android is very subjective.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, it really isn&#8217;t. Aside from Game Center, better app/game selections, and better hardware, and a sleeker UI for the App Store, name one thing at all that iOS has over Android.</p>
<p>Is that sarcasm?  I mean those are pretty big things, easily enough to choose one platform over the other :)</p>
<p>Nope, not sarcasm. Game Center is a nice thing which I do want. The better apps and games really are slowly becoming not a huge deal, and more and more of the iOS selecting is coming to Android pretty quickly lately. I&#8217;d say there are only maybe 10 iOS apps that aren&#8217;t on Android that I want. The UI for the App Store isn&#8217;t a huge deal, and the Play Store has had better actual features for a long time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d take the play store UI over the app store ANYDAY</p>
<p>Heck, just not having to type my password makes it worth it&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a feature coming in iOS 6 that should&#8217;ve been in iPhone OS 2. I also find the play store much more reliable to use, and the automatic updates are very useful.</p>
<p>but password should be required for paid apps, no?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>You had to sign in when you got the phone. Confirmation before you purchase should be enough, and a PIN (if you want it) is better security than your password to all your Google services.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty subjective to me&#8230;</p>
<p>So wait, there are just 10 apps that you want that aren&#8217;t available on Android, and therefore app disparity objectively doesn&#8217;t matter?</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re using a skewed definition of the word subjective and objective. Objectivity implies that everyone will get the exact, same result no matter how they look at it. If  objectivity truly existed in phone reviews, there would be magical formula that every reviewer used, and every review score you find online would be exactly the same.</p>
<p>Unless you have a better reason to explain why there is great variation in review scores among products, the conclusion would be that preference for devices is, in fact, subjective.</p>
<p>The question you were answering is: why should I choose another platform over the one I&#8217;m happy with right now? I have no qualms whatsoever with your preferences leaning towards Android, but to claim that a universal formula exists that can show us that one platform is superior over the other is absurd.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy for you that you found your happiness in Android, but if the platform is truly objectively better, than please do enlighten everyone here as to what that formula would be.</p>
<p>And dont forget: youcan even get malware through PlayStore! Thats something unseen in the iOS world and a huge selling point&#8230; err&#8230; yea!</p>
<p>I&#8217;s love a filter for &#8220;Apple&#8221;, &#8220;iOS&#8221; and &#8220;iPhone&#8221; in Android stories to automatically flags and removes them since they have nothing to do with the article.</p>
<p>So name something in addition to the list you just posted? OK how about better 3rd party accessory support?  Direct access to a better all round ecosystem? Better Security?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic that iOS users pride themselves on 3rd party accessories. The problem with this is that almost every Android devices uses open standards, so we don&#8217;t need to have an accessory say &#8220;Made for Android&#8221; like iOS does. So people notice that and think there aren&#8217;t any. But the fact is, basically EVERY accessory that doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;Made for iOS&#8221; will work with Android. You can even use a Bluetooth game controller like a WiiMote and play games on it, without any 3rd party software. You can plug in a keyboard and a mouse and a display to a Galaxy Nexus and use it as a computer. That&#8217;s the beauty of being in an open environment instead of having to use Approved by Apple accessories.</p>
<p>Better ecosystem? Google has had iCloud and more before Apple released it. Google Music even does more than iTunes Match does currently. I&#8217;d say after using both ecosystems that Google has the upper hand, by far.</p>
<p>Better security? How?</p>
<p>3rd party accessories does not necessarily mean electronic things. Cases and such come to mind, as well. For every 500 cases I&#8217;ve seen for an iPhone 4/4s, I see like five for a major Android phone.</p>
<p>Also, the things that are made for an iPhone generally have much better integration. My car can certainly play music from an Android device when I use a standard audio cable. However, if I use the iPhone/iPod hookup, I can either voice or use the car&#8217;s stereo to search through my music quite easily, while I cannot do that on my Android device.</p>
<p>As far as ecosystems go, I cannot comment on Google&#8217;s stuff because it has been over a year since I used it. I&#8217;ll know better once I get my Galaxy Nexus in a few weeks. Same for security, although I guess it is telling that businesses are adopting the iPhone WAY more than any Android devices (in general).</p>
<p>Ah, I missed that. That is true, however that comes with having one form factor for so long. You can still find some great Android cases and things, especially for the Nexus, but the iPhone does have more. However, my point was arguing that Android (almost) has it all now in regard to software, not third party support.</p>
<p>As a side note, I&#8217;ve read that you&#8217;ll soon be able to stream music via Bluetooth to cars with NFC, if they have that built in. That will be pretty nice.</p>
<p>In regard to security, there isn&#8217;t one known virus for Android, or for iOS. It has all been malware, and both iOS and Android do have malware.</p>
<p>When you get your Nexus, try out Google Music, Google Voice, Drive, Google+, etc. to sync everything. You&#8217;ll see how unbelievably easy it is.</p>
<p>Yeah, what I plan on doing is the same thing I&#8217;ve done the past couple years, actually. At AT&amp;T (and I think other carriers offer something similar) I can get a phone and use it for 30 days. If I &#8220;don&#8217;t like it&#8221; I can return it. In that 30 days, I&#8217;ll have an HTC One X, and I&#8217;m going to load it up as much as possible with Google&#8217;s stuff. Try to use all of their services and see how I like it. If I do like it, I&#8217;m actually going to return the phone and get the Nexus for $349. That way I can try everything out (essentially for free, aside from like a 25 dollar restocking fee) and see if I like it more than iOS. If I can&#8217;t get that done by the beginning of September, I may not get the GN, and wait for the new line of Nexus devices that are supposedly coming out. Time will tell! I just like to, you know, actually try things before I pass judgement on whether or not I like them. If only other tech readers did this&#8230;..</p>
<p>Just keep in mind the experience is not the same at all with the One X and Nexus devices. I tried a One X out today and I&#8217;m not a fan of the UI or how everything feels at all. The Nexus to me seems far cleaner and better.</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s really just a matter of opinion.  I found TouchWiz to be less interesting and fun to use than Sense, but a lot of people find the opposite.</p>
<blockquote>My car can certainly play music from an Android device when I use a standard audio cable. However, if I use the iPhone/iPod hookup, I can either voice or use the car’s stereo to search through my music quite easily, while I cannot do that on my Android device.</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to say that because your car manufacturer decided to support Apple&#8217;s non-standard connection, that it will soon become the most expensive obsolete 3rd party accessory ever when the iPhone5 is released with a different non-standard connection.</p>
<p>Micro-usb can export HDMI, USB-OTG, Digital and analog out.  Apple&#8217;s choices to be unique and not play with others is one of it&#8217;s big problems.</p>
<p>A few corrections. Not all accessories have to be approved by Apple.</p>
<p>The Ecosystem is nowhere near Apples level for Music, Books, Tv Shows,  Magazines. Google is getting better, unless you are outside the US (which I am) at which point the gap betwen them is massive</p>
<p>Security is better because apps are sandboxed. Far more standards are supported on iOS too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll add another benefit to iOS here as well. Full Backups. On Android devices I have still not found a way to back up to the same level as I can on iOS (ie almost everything, contacts, photos, save games and much more)</p>
<p>more standards? in what sense? having never had a g-nex nor an iphone, i&#8217;m genuinely asking.</p>
<p>Android apps are sandboxed as well. Android is a very secure OS. Not sure why you don&#8217;t think it is.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say its not secure, I said its not as secure as iOS</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say android might be less secure because google doesn&#8217;t have the power to push a hotfix to all phones at the push of a button, and carriers/oems are awful at software updates.</p>
<p>The security models are also slightly different, but that does not make android less secure, they just prioritize different things.</p>
<p>i find it silly &#8211; couple of minutes and its already derailed into yet another stupid ios vs android battlefield. android apps run in a dalvik sandbox, android is based on unix. dont you think its futile to go on with this if youre missing basic concepts like these? i do like apple products but didnt get iphone, so you zthink its okay for me to jump into a iphone related discussion on theverge and go &#8220;iphone is bad, it has no multitasking&#8221; without knowing the full details of it? come on man, youre better than this.</p>
<p>They are sandboxed but not as strictly as iOS. Sandboxed Android apps are still able to share resources and data with each other if the permissions are set to allow it. And I&#8217;m not &#8220;going on with this&#8221; I&#8217;m merely giving the user what he asked for, a list of things that iOS could conceivably do better than Android.</p>
<p>For the record I don&#8217;t prefer one OS over the other (although I am currently using a Galaxy Nexus)</p>
<p>duh, sharing data is one of the strongpoints. intentions are the reason why it does not need to be rewritten should facebook become the new myspace tomorrow because nothing is ingrained nor fixed. i dont see whats so &#8220;unsafe&#8221; about it, apps decide if they want to open themselves to it, providing resources to be fetched by others. from a programmers standpoint that is a GREAT invention, it could even change the way we think of standards as this system proves that actually we dont. apps are sandboxes and safe, they simply cannot go beyond sharing and fetching declared open resources. /// dont care what phone youre using man, no one does, youre derailing a discussion with your own &#8220;facts,&#8221; thats whats so silly about it.</p>
<blockquote>android is based on unix.</blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t you mean Android is based on Linux and iOS like OS X is based on Unix?</p>
<p>you&#8217;re very misinformed about android. you probably shouldn&#8217;t be talking about it.</p>
<p>Ok sure. I guess I&#8217;ll have to quit my day job as well then. Damn</p>
<p>if it involves talking about android, yes.</p>
<p>It does. Quite a lot actually. Also iOS. I didn&#8217;t realise I was quite so bad at it. I guess I should get straight to work on my resignation.</p>
<p>one word: Amazon</p>
<p>That&#8217;s personal choice. Usability for people who have never used a smartphone before in their life is what iOS has over Android and a lot better apps. Easier to optimize your apps for the hardware</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe the first point. The two OSes work in largely the same way, with the only main difference for the user being the apps tray versus having every single app you install fill up your home screens. How is iOS easier for beginners? I don&#8217;t see that at all.</p>
<p>I gave my mom my Galaxy Nexus and told her to use it(Fresh install. No mods) and she couldn&#8217;t figure it out at all</p>
<p>That&#8217;s your mom. Her experience isn&#8217;t what most beginners would experience. I&#8217;m thinking she&#8217;d be confused with the iPhone too then. I really cannot think of a single thing outside the apps drawer that would be different.</p>
<p>Nope. My mom is the person I think of when they&#8217;re new to tech. She uses my iPad no problem.</p>
<p>What was she confused about specifically? I would have no idea what the problem would be. It&#8217;s pretty simple to use.</p>
<p>This might sound silly, but she had a lot of issue unlocking it. She didn&#8217;t really understand how to copy paste properly or natigate text editing very well</p>
<p>Guess slide-to-unlock is more important than we think it is to some people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about that pre-defined path</p>
<p>One must not define the path.</p>
<p>If it is any comfort, my mom can&#8217;t figure out unlocking neither my ipad or my GN :S</p>
<p>Obviously each person&#8217;s experience will vary, however this past Christmas my family purchased their first smartphones and, after trying multiple products both with and without my assistance, they all decided on iPhones.</p>
<p>They found iOS to be easier to use than Android, preferred the metal and glass build quality of the iPhone to anything HTC or Samsung offered, and liked that all iOS devices look and work the same. Meaning, if they purchased iPads, their learning curve would be small since they already own iPhones.</p>
<p>That may not mean much to advanced users who hop from device to device, root and install custom ROMS and customize their launchers but, as entry level users (we&#8217;re talking people without computers here) they preferred consistency over flexibility.</p>
<p>Add in the 3rd party accessory market and better overall apps and games (I use a GNexus and even I agree with that) and the decision wasn&#8217;t even close, really.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just how it is though. I go by: are you comfortable with linux and command line interface on a computer? yes then get android. If not get an iphone. I want an android phone, but I would never ever recommend anything other than an iPhone to my mom.</p>
<p>Different users need different things. Yes, I&#8217;m tech savvy, but I stuck with an iPhone because of the apple ecosystem&#8230; :P</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m seriously considering switching to android. The iPhone is SOOOOO far behind it&#8217;s not even funny anymore.</p>
<p>Either apple gives us something new in the iPhone 5 or goodbye, Apple.</p>
<p>On that note, which Android phone would you recommend, the Nexus or the S3?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re asking me, I&#8217;ve never owned an android phone (or an iPhone, just too expensive) so I can&#8217;t say. I just have an ipod touch and am not a huge fan of iOS based on that.</p>
<p>S3, without a doubt</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want updates I agree SIII seems like the best choice. If you want JB before 2013 there is only the Nexus. Depends on your priorities really</p>
<p>Wait so without owning neither android nor apple, you would recommend an iphone to your mother, and you think android require command line understanding? (sigh) and now you give out information that is almost guaranteed to be wrong. The difference between 2.3 and 4.0 were huge, especially the fact that it contained a kernel update. The difference between 4.0 to 4.1 are minor, and doesn&#8217;t take as long to implant.</p>
<p>Either you are trolling or just very ignorant.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think android require command line understanding, but it&#8217;s it&#8217;s a good gauge of how computer savy the user is, and thus how well they can use android. Sure you can get it to work  without knowing anything, but then you&#8217;re not taking advantage of it&#8217;s power so my not just get an iphone instead which has fewer ways you can mess stuff up?</p>
<p>My parents are terrible with computers so I wouldn&#8217;t recommend they get any smartphone, but I&#8217;d rather she get an iPhone over android. That said, I do have an ipod touch and I don&#8217;t think iOS is that easy to use, or as intuitive as everyone make it out to be. It all require an understanding of basic OS paradigms.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s basically common knowledge now that if you want OS updates get a nexus. If you&#8217;re happy with the phone as it is when you buy it (which you hopefully are, otherwise why buy it?) and don&#8217;t care about updates get a skinned one. Nothing wrong with that, if it works for you why bother with updates? And I don&#8217;t expect a free upgrade from Windows 7 to 8 so it&#8217;s not a god-given right anyway</p>
<p>Personally, I will never (ever) buy another device running TouchWiz, Sense or Blur ever again. I&#8217;m tired of spending cash on the latest, greatest device of the moment only to see it abandoned 6 months down the road once the manufacturers have something new to promote.</p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;m currently using a Galaxy Nexus and (mostly) loving it. It may not be the most cutting edge device on the market but it provides a pure, consistent Android experience (if there is such a thing) and I know that I&#8217;ll actually receive OS updates in the future.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t be happier, really.</p>
<p>if you have been using a nexus since the beginning you would know that every update would equal a new device.</p>
<p>Most of my non- tech friends have had issues with Android sub-settings. iOS everything settings are pretty much in centralized location on the device or there is clear on screen button showing that there is a settings option in app.</p>
<p>Android, has or had a habit of requiring users to hold down this part of the screen for this and that plus camera settings being buried in sub settings. With iOS everything is just there on screen. In the camera app and want to turn HDR on the setting button is there, switch to rear camera or back to front it it is right there. Want to turn on grid mode it is right there no fiddling with hundred of sub-settings.</p>
<p>Does she use an Iphone? If so then DUH it&#8217;s not what she&#8217;s used to and she&#8217;ll in general be unwilling to figure it out truly.</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t use an iPhone. She knows how though</p>
<p>Then she would also have a hard time with an iPhone&#8230;One of my students (she is 16) has an iPhone 4S &#8211; she has NO idea how to use siri and still hasn&#8217;t setup even her email because she doesn&#8217;t know how&#8230;.and she&#8217;s had the phone for months.</p>
<p>Yep. That&#8217;s the average consumer. They need to be walked through it, but once they get it, it sticks.</p>
<p>I dunno, my mom has trouble surfing the net and using any email client including Gmail.  She can&#8217;t use my son&#8217;s Ipad nor my galaxy nexus. Though my son can jump from his Ipod and ipad right into my nexus with no issues.  She is 75 and he is 11. Consumers are changing fast.</p>
<p>Fair point. But your son is also born into the age of technology, just like me. My mom is 55 and she&#8217;s learning to love my iPad</p>
<p>Like Steve Jobs said, death will eventually take care of this. I mean that in a general way.</p>
<p>I agree. Everything is buried in the system settings menus, except sometimes the apps have settings within the app, and sometimes there&#8217;s both. It&#8217;s actually quite confusing. Android menus are known to be confusing, but at least app settings are contained in the app and system settings are contained in the settings panel and that is very consistent.</p>
<p>The app tray is more organized on Android also, with apps showing up in ABC order in the tray (and more categories on skinned devices), with you putting them on your homescreen as you like, ala Windows (which, gee, like 80% of computer users use) while iOS clutters the home screen with apps in the order you install them and you have to rearrange them one by one and you can&#8217;t even selectively arrange them (as in leave gaps between grid locations).</p>
<p>Not saying Android is perfect obviously, just pointing a few ways where the whole, &#8220;Android is so complicated, iOS is so easy&#8221; argument starts to fall apart. Everytime I pick someone&#8217;s fruit device that isn&#8217;t my own, and i&#8217;m looking for a particular app, I have to use the search field or cycle through each homescreen looking for it, but on Android, the experience is always consistent.</p>
<p>No iOS you organize your apps in pages or folders that you want. It&#8217;s easy to find apps because you put them where they are. It may be hard for someone to find where the app tray is on android. Also all your newest apps show up on your last screen. Abc list aren&#8217;t good. They are very slow to use. You might as well use the spotlight search.</p>
<p>you completely missed what he was saying. also, your second sentence also applies to android.</p>
<p>I dk maybe it is a carry over from OS X I use spotlight for everything on iOS pretty much that when it came to iOS 3.0 I jumped for Joy and ever since I just type in two letters and get the app name. Also love Spotlight search because how deep it goes, contacts, notes, emails, SMS, app data.</p>
<p>With iOS 6 beta tho I find I use Siri to launch apps more and more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d give &#8220;sleeker UI for the App Store&#8221; to Apple. Maybe sleeker for a pure design standpoint, but even that is pretty subjective. With Android, the ability to get books, apps, and everything else in the same store is an advantage as well as being able to update apps without logging in every time or having automatic updates. Those are HUGE UX advantages.</p>
<p>And Play Store is more of an organized mess than the App Store. Both have their advantages.</p>
<p>It USED to be unorganized. Lately they&#8217;ve pretty much come to about the same level, especially with having direct links to apps in the dropdown when you&#8217;re searching. The Play Store even encrypts apps per device now to prevent piracy, has a 15 minute refund window, takes data downloads into account and doesn&#8217;t count that against your 15 minutes, and updates apps automatically, and only with the updated PARTS of the apps, not having to download it all again.</p>
<p>Yep. I know. I use it too :P I like the Play Store&#8217;s features and how it works but I dislike how to navigate it. It&#8217;s hard to &#8220;discover&#8221; new apps. I usually end up going in knowing what I want. On my iPad I&#8217;m discovering new apps all the time(not good for my wallet :x )</p>
<p>That is true. They need to work on that. Although it is very easy to discover great new apps if you follow Android blogs.</p>
<p>I usually just get recommendations from Twitter about apps. Or read The Verge on things. Thanks to The Verge I got the Flipboard beta in it&#8217;s early stage</p>
<p>Try following Android Police. They post about great new apps all the time.</p>
<p>They do have the recommended, features, more app like this etc etc. Its good enough i&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>Direct download to phone from browser is enough to beat the App store just on features.</p>
<p>Um direct download from any iTunes connected device doesn&#8217;t rival that?</p>
<p>Download iPad auto downloads on iPhone, iPod touch (if it is universal binary app) download on iTunes on computer auto downloads to iPhone, iPad, iPod touch. Same goes for books, music, movies, TV Shows.</p>
<p>I agree. Everything is all in one place in the Play Store, and you can search it from the web and push app installs to your devices. Android handles apps purchased under multiple accounts better, clearly has more features like automatic updates, password protection being optional, and update over wifi only (iOS may have this but I have WiFi only fruit products).</p>
<p>I have never had a problem discovering new apps, but I admittedly don&#8217;t find out about apps on either platform by browsing the store, but instead by following blogs.</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;password protection being optional&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>How is that really a good thing, granted free apps it should be like that but paid apps should always require a password in my mind. My family is always playing with one of my iDevices and if it wasn&#8217;t for that protection I would be broke because of them buying crap.</p>
<p>Apple actually beefed that up because there was a report from a few years ago where kids did that to fathers account and it was big PR shit storm cause it was like $400 worth of purchases the kid made.</p>
<p>BESIDES THOSE 4 THINGS, NAME ONE THING BETTER ON IOS!</p>
<p>&#8230;fanboy logic :-/</p>
<p><img src="http://www.haaretz.com/polopoly_fs/1.436666.1339759782!/image/1157330727.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_640/1157330727.png" /></p>
<p>The better game line up on iOS is kind of a killer feature.  iMessage is also pretty nice. In many other ways though, android is indeed better, especially on the hardware front. The iPhone with its tiny screen just looks ridiculous compared to modern android hardware.</p>
<p>Better games are quickly becoming not a big deal. Tons of the best apps and games are coming to Android at an accelerating pace. I can only think of maybe 10 apps or games I want that aren&#8217;t available on Android. Android has had iMessage for a while (Google Talk) and could let you video chat over 3G for ages. It&#8217;s also installed on every Android device by default, and works between browsers and Android too, not just Androids. It is also most open, allowing iOS users to get a third party app to use it as well.</p>
<p>Google Talk and iMessage aren&#8217;t even close to being the same thing. Google Talk is comparable to BBM, but iMessage is fully integrated and completely replaces SMS for iOS users. iOS can video chat over 3G with Skype or anything else. FaceTime is a big deal because it&#8217;s fully integrated and can actually replace regular calls. Android doesn&#8217;t have that video calling integration.</p>
<p>I think MightyChat might be closer to an iMessage replacement. It&#8217;s not nearly as elegant, but it does mimic the &#8220;text anywhere&#8221; concept decently.</p>
<p>For the curious, it&#8217;s basically an app on your phone that forwards all text messages to a browser plugin (Safari, Chrome, etc.) and then back again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using it extensively since giving up my 4S and so far, it works just fine.</p>
<p>I could think of more than 10 for sure, but Android is catching up.  I still seems that new big games often come to iOS first though, then Android later, often much later.  Mostly I play CAVE shooters on my iPhone, and I see a couple of them are on Android, but most aren&#8217;t. No Final Fantasy Tactics or Chrono Trigger either.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2/jtr.jpg" />Well, now we know what happened to those cool WebOS features. Swipe removal or closure is pretty sweet, natural feeling and it doesn&#8217;t require any precise tapping. <img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2fj/fvx.jpg" /> <br />
 </p>
<p>It is amazing how far we have come in 5 years. I remember how many people thought a 3.5 inch screen iPhone released in 2007 was huge and that it would fail. Also that the lack of keyboard would be its undoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aside from Game Center, better app/game selections, and better hardware, and a sleeker UI for the App Store, name one thing at all that iOS has over Android&#8221;</p>
<p>So&#8230;besides the stuff that iOS does better than android, name one thing that iOS does better?</p>
<p>LOL, what a dumb question. Its funny how you marginalize sleek UI as if it was nothing. I&#8217;m not saying JB is not sleek, but your questions is ridiculous.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying &#8220;besides what iOS does better.&#8221; I&#8217;m saying that the only things that iOS does better are pretty small. I&#8217;d love to see Game Center, but I hardly think that&#8217;s a killer feature, and the other disadvantages are pretty small and slowly going away.</p>
<p>Those are pretty damn huge features that iOS does better. And you forget things like iCloud backups, syncing, and some of the biggest of all: AirPlay and Siri.</p>
<p>Airplay is the shit. Reflection for the Mac has made demoing apps to to co-workers and clients so much easier just by using screen flow to capture the screen. Siri is much more useful in iOS 6 but was great for reminders, alarms and such in iOS 5. Also used it for most of my searches. Also iCloud and documents in the cloud and app data is just getting better with iOS 6.</p>
<p>The problem is most iOS users never use Android to actually appreciate the good things about it, like wise a good number of Android users never used iOS to understand some of the unique things about it.</p>
<p>If you never experienced the smoothness of iOS you are going to think you Android experience rocks and if you don&#8217;t experience some of the open features of Android you are going to think iOS rocks. Truth both platforms are not perfect and that is fine because they will continue to push forward.</p>
<p>Both App Stores have a great selection of niche or platform specific apps like Android keyboards, launchers, and so on and so. iOS has some of the best photo apps, music production apps, video recording apps, office and documents and productivity apps.</p>
<p>I know this because I have used every iPhone since the 3G and every Nexus since the Nexus One. My biggest complaint have been eventually addressed with the platform except for a decent non-gmail native email client.</p>
<p>I think the big feature for iOS 6 is gonna be passbook but not NFC, Apple already uses Bluetooth 4.0 in the Apple Store to make fast purchase without the need for register so I think the biggest feature is gonna be Passbook and maybe payments over Bluetooth 4.0 since every single Apple device from 4S, iPad 3, 2011 Macs have it it so the system is in place and Apple can do a 360 around the credit card companies and NFC.</p>
<p>Awesome note</p>
<p>Better hardware. This is a joke, right?</p>
<p>I think you just nailed a lot of what matters most in a phone.</p>
<p>I seriously love how in ever android discussion some fsndroid always brings up iOS. If you don&#8217;t like iOS leave it alone. <br />
I like iOS for apps, ease of use, design, keyboard, iCloud, game enter, hardware, battery life, mail app, Siri, and the way apple implements features. We might not always get features first but the way apple excutes them are excellent. Just like multitasking in ios 4. I love how well it works and preserves your battery life. Copy and paste how well it was done. Looking forward to ios 6 maps with yelp integration.</p>
<p>Well you just named everything that counts in a phone. So yeah apple has it locked down.</p>
<blockquote>better app/game selections,</blockquote>
<p>you could have just stopped there. because that&#8217;s what is most important</p>
<p>But yes it is subjective&#8230;. sure android has features other os don&#8217;t, but I don&#8217;t care about any of them. Personally I just hate androids UI overall anyways, don&#8217;t know why, I just don&#8217;t like using it. Enjoy using you&#8217;re phone like I enjoy using mine&#8230;. why can&#8217;t it just end at that?</p>
<p>Aside from everything that normal people care about, name one thing that iOS has over Android.</p>
<p>Did you read what you wrote? You just said that outside of apps, hardware, and a sleeker UI that iOS is worse than Android. What else is there? Those are by far the most important parts of an OS.</p>
<p>Well done for hijacking the thread with an off-topic video. A new one too. Bravo.</p>
<p>really? THREE posts in and you managed to turn this into iOS vs Android?? I&#8217;m not sure, but I think there are a <strong>couple</strong> other places on the internet where you can debate that..</p>
<p>Oh don&#8217;t turn it into one of these :( I agree with you about Android, but come on.</p>
<p>Damn, The White Lotus attributes to like half the comments on this thread.</p>
<p>here is my 2 pennies i think for anyone that likes to have a phone with the latest &amp; greatest android OS and a phone that is by no definition a slouch as far as specs are concerned than of course GNex all the way but if you are a person that loves to hack stuff than sure the One-X all the way personally i choose the GNex which i hope to be getting soon. I just cant justify getting a phone that will not run the latest OS without having to hack the thing</p>
<p>also i think chris is mistaken vlads views are still 2012 views the same problem exists in android (as far as the updating process and skinning is concerned) today just as they did in 2011.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like watching Yoda trying to reason with&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Chewy?</p>
<p>You need to have this playing in the background when reading this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egne2ZCMM_0" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egne2ZCMM_0</a></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>For the best, complete Android experience? YES. It is. Who has Jellybean?! I Got Jellybean!!!</p>
<p>And I love it!</p>
<p>I concur. Stock Android isn&#8217;t just important because you get the latest updates, like Jelly Bean (personally I&#8217;d be PISSED if I bought a phone and then saw JB and knew I wouldn&#8217;t be getting it any time soon), but also because it shows carriers they should update their damn phones already. If you purchase a non-Nexus device, you&#8217;re telling carriers to go ahead an not worry about giving you the latest updates.</p>
<p>Very good point! Buying a higher-spec&#8217;ed phone with crappier software is like casting a vote that you enjoy crappy software.</p>
<p>Yes.  And I don&#8217;t think Chris Ziegler fully addressed that very important point &#8211; Why would a phone owner trust Samsung to get the next update, and HOW MUCH will it suck when evry Nexus gets it but the GIII doesn&#8217;t?  It doesn&#8217;t look so fast and shiny anymore then&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a question of happiness, and that&#8217;s what Vlad and Chris are basically debating.  If you&#8217;re going with a single device for a 22-24 month haul, you need major updates.  In that time, you have to fall back in love for the device or you&#8217;ll feel trapped.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure getting the latest and greatest from Google is so great. Being a Nexus owner up until this point has also meant suffering through half baked features and apps . I can honestly see why an OEM may want to skip a version until things get smoother. Gingerbread had at least 3 updates before it started feeling less like dog food. I can also honestly say that ICS is the first Android update that hasn&#8217;t felt like this, but if I am an OEM, and my customers are happy with the ins and outs of the current build, I&#8217;d be hesitant to rock the boat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m never buying a non nexus again.</p>
<p>Same here&#8230;got my nexus s and never looked back&#8230;getting the galaxy nexus this week</p>
<p>Got my Galaxy Nexus when it first came out&#8230;&#8230;thats all I wrote.</p>
<p>Just got the Galaxy Nexus two weeks ago (right before the ban started).  I came from an iPhone 4 to the Nexus and I am loving it.  Native integration of GTalk is amazing.  I got an LED App so now I have a different color flashing depending on what notification I have.  It took a little bit to get used to Android &#8211; apps, setup, customization, but now I am getting in a good groove.  Might be rooting it soon and putting on Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Its crazy that my Nexus S is getting Jelly Bean. I mean, it has ONE core and its beating all but 1 phone to updates. I&#8217;ll miss it when I upgrade.</p>
<p>Same here. It&#8217;s closest thing to the advantages of the iPhone&#8217;s combined hardware and software experience, without buying an iPhone.</p>
<p>its furthest to the disadvantages i would say. i bought a galaxy nexus because i am design conscious, same reason i type this with a macbook. design is important and jellybean is a fresh, modern os. walled garden, i do not need to mention it even. unlocked it, rooted it, hacked it, customized it, phone for free via voip and generally having a blast.</p>
<p>Absolutely yes. I can`t say I have as much experience as the Verge Staff, but I think Chris is insane. <br />
While the specs are better on the S3, the experience is not faster, or prettier. The sound set and icons are<em> disgusting.</em> It was really irresponsible of Samsung to use such ugly UI sounds and have them set On by default. yuck.<br />
Sense is toned down, but its still clunkier, it doesn&#8217;t do anything better than stock and does most things worse.</p>
<p>But Chris was making the point of being subjective. Personally I own both the Galaxy Nexus with Jellybean and the HTC EVO LTE. Honestly for Jelly bean its biggest draw was strictly Google Now, and maybe the notifications when they are all supported. Because the speed and camera increases already exist in HTC&#8217;s ImageSense software suite. Honestly the speeds is identical to any of the Krait CPUs from Qualcomm.</p>
<p>Its nice to have the latest and greatest, but for most normal people( you know card carrying 2 year contract people) you generally are stuck with what you got for two years. And buying a the already outdated Galaxy Nexus is honestly just not good idea unless you like to tinker with your phone. Honestly software updates and improvements are always important but having a solid base hardware requirement FROM this year is even more important to me in the long run.</p>
<p>Updates are great, but the software itself has to be good. Touchwiz is uglier and harder to use than stock, and Jellywiz will likely be the same.</p>
<p>funny thing is&#8230;I buy my phones outright&#8230;my budget has no limit&#8230;and the choice for me is easy&#8230;Galaxy S3.</p>
<p>Had the Galaxy Nexus&#8230;the camera is so bad it was a complete non-starter and the whole Sense and SD card and battery of the One X is also a no-go.</p>
<p>TouchWiz is hard to use?  I think it&#8217;s the opposite. I&#8217;d prefer a stock look. but the features of TouchWiz are very good.</p>
<p>If your budget has no limit, you will be able to trade up in a year, instead of two years like most people.  You don&#8217;t have to worry about upgrade path, which is what GNex still has on the GS3.</p>
<p>@allened &#8211; Respectfully, I disagree. To me, the two biggest improvements introduced in Android 4.1 are clearly &#8220;Project Butter&#8221; and the improved notifications.</p>
<p>Google Now? Meh.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand this either. What&#8217;s the point of having &#8220;moar power&#8221; in the S3, if the GNex is already fast and fluid? On a PC more GHz let you do some things faster, but on a limited phone what does it do? Will the browser open faster on the S3? Is day to day use faster? Everything I&#8217;ve seen says the UI is near instant on the GNex so how is more power and advantage over newer versions of Android?</p>
<p>More power usually does translate directly into faster browsing, &#8211; the browser always wants moar coarz &#8211; except samsung skinned the browser and made it worse.</p>
<p>So, how many threads does the browser use for rendering? If it&#8217;s just one, then (everything else being equal) having more cores does not make the browser render faster.</p>
<p>Yes the SGS3 is faster than the GNex in everything you just mentioned.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen the S3&#8217;s icons or heard its sounds, but considering that ICS&#8217;s are also pretty bad perhaps I don&#8217;t want to know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very subjective and I happen to like the sounds, but the icons are much worse than stock.</p>
<p>Yes. Only if you care about unlocking, rooting, and playing with newest OS.</p>
<p>If Moto comes out with the HD version of the MAXX anytime soon then that&#8217;s the best phone because of build quality, radios, and battery life.</p>
<p>Build quality is your opinion.  The Galaxy Nexus is a rock solid phone, even if its made out of plastic (which doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean its crappy material).</p>
<p>build quality isnt opinion. it&#8217;s a fact really. I could say the iphone has better built quality then the gnex and it does but it&#8217;s way more fragile.</p>
<p>Different aspects are fact, but overall saying one is better or not is an opinion. Overall, I like the build quality of the Nexus better, including just how it looks and it&#8217;s slight curve. The iPhone is sleek and polished, but it&#8217;s tiny and kind of old looking with it&#8217;s button.</p>
<p>One thing that I wished the Nexus devices had is a physical home button on the front of the device; you&#8217;ve got to physically pick it up to turn the screen on, instead of leaving it on a desk like you can with the iPhone or SIII.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to pick it up to turn the screen on. The sleep button is quite accessible. It just takes 2 fingers instead of one to make sure the phone doesn&#8217;t slide sideways.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned both the GN and the iPhone 4 and I&#8217;d still have to say that objectively the iPhone&#8217;s hardware is higher quality. I&#8217;d even say better. The screen on my GN scratched very easily and the phone rattles already. Not sure why, but it isn&#8217;t quite as solid feeling and I don&#8217;t think it will last as long. It is still great, but the iPhone really is an amazing piece of hardware.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call that objective. Many people have experienced the opposite actually. I&#8217;ve never had a single scratch on my Nexus.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s down to the fact that there&#8217;s very little plastic on the exterior of the iPhone 4.  It&#8217;s predominantly glass and metal, with only two 1 mm thick strips of plastic around the edge (and the buttons, of course).</p>
<p>This makes it a very rigid device, but it also gives it a texture that makes it feel more solidly built than, say, the iPhone 3G or the Nexus S, which had cheap-feeling plastic backs.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve never held a One X and have only held a GS3 for a few seconds, so I can&#8217;t comment on how they feel.)</p>
<p>Of course, build quality isn&#8217;t just about how it feels in your hand.  The build quality of the iPhone&#8217;s buttons is pretty poor.  My two-year-old iPhone 4&#8217;s power and home buttons are both exhibiting signs of fatigue &#8211; a fairly common complaint across many iPhone models.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for he iPhone design, it&#8217;s a beautiful design, timeless even, but to stick with that design going with a bigger screen&#8230;.it will cheapen the original design. I think the Nexus should be made of metal. With the same exact lines, but maybe a little more chiseled look. There you have a winner</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re confused. Buying a Nexus is for people who DON&#8217;T want to root too. Rooting and using a custom ROM is great for experiencing stock Android and getting timely updates. You don&#8217;t need to do that with the Nexus.</p>
<p>Eh, yes and no. The Nexus is about choice. Giving users the choice to run whatever they want. Root it if you please, or just use it stock if you like</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. Rooting is great on Nexuses too, but if you don&#8217;t want to root then you can still get a Nexus and get instant updates.</p>
<p>Ha! A lot of people throw on CM9 or AOKP as soon as they can.</p>
<p>I only booted up my Nexus in ICS just to turn USB Debugging on, rooted it, installed JellyBean and never looked back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with you. I&#8217;ll buy a nexus device when Samsung doesn&#8217;t make it.</p>
<p>I have to feel sorry for Samsung. They&#8217;ve made the Nexus so beautiful, even with the hump. The shape is the perfect shape</p>
<p>Perfect is a subjective term. I&#8217;ve never had a dropped call or randomly lost my wi-fi signal on my razr can you say the same?</p>
<p>Yes I never dropped a call or wifi signal on Samsung phones..there you go I said it.</p>
<p>As you said it is a subjective term. Moto and Verizon combo sucks big time. Moto should stop sleeping in bed with Verizon and make devices for consumers not for useless Verizon.</p>
<p>I still think that a stock Google phone is the best. I understand that the Nexus&#8217; specs are a bit outdated, but it&#8217;s still masses of power. Unless you&#8217;re a gamer. I haven&#8217;t gamed that much on my phones so I wouldn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Exactly. Google is a lot better at this than samsung, htc or anybody really.</p>
<p>You do realize Samsung is the one who makes the GNex, right?</p>
<p>Do you know what the GNex is? lol.</p>
<p>Well there&#8217;s a big difference in hardware. You get a better screen, better camera, expandable storage with say the GS3.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only hardware, but you also get Touchwiz software that doesn&#8217;t show up in vanilla android. For instance, the GS3 has great camera settings compared to vanilla android. Motion settings are also very nice, but not on vanilla Android.</p>
<p>So it really matters on what you want. If Google came out with a new GNex phone at I/O I probably would have considered that. But it was a no brainer choosing the GS3 over the GNex (for me at least)</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t run Jelly Bean then well you don&#8217;t own a Nexus.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>The rest of us will have  it soon enough, because of CyanogenMod.</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s a Nexus One, which officially didn&#8217;t even get ICS.</p>
<p>If someone cares about versions then they know abt custom roms and SGS3 is one of the best dev support devices. CM10 with JellyBean source should drop anytime.</p>
<p>We have latest version + awesome hardware on SGS3 compared to crappy camera on GPU on the Nexus. Good luck with your dated phone. Hopefully the next Nexus has better camera and not just some other device.</p>
<p>For me it&#8217;s about the same as the One X or S III. The only difference being the Nexus is a lot cheaper now. There&#8217;s no outright winner for me between the three, so it does simply end up being a price war.</p>
<p>The fact that this article exist shows that OEMs are doing better skins.  Hopefully the PDK will close the gap on updates.  That will bring Android to a extremely mature mobile OS.</p>
<p>I care about specs less and less, and care about OS updates and user experience more. I would gladly buy a slightly less powerful GNex over the beast that is the GSIII because of vanilla Android.</p>
<p>This. As long as my phone runs smooth, i dont care.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s come to the point where Samsung Touchwiz or Nature UX or whatever is actually just as if not more smooth than vanilla Android. I think that&#8217;s Chris&#8217; point. You can have the smoothness of Nature UX on the SIII (and trust me, it is buttery) and the power inside. It is also has a great battery life.</p>
<p>I agree with Chris; it&#8217;s time to stop bashing a great phone simply because it doesn&#8217;t have the stock experience. That <em>was</em> justifiable, but not when there is no longer a performance hit because of it.</p>
<p>Who cares how smooth the UI transistions are? The actual operation of touchwiz is absurdly clunky.</p>
<p>Have you used the GSIII? What in particular would you say is &#8220;absurdly clunky&#8221;</p>
<p>I cannot think of any feature or operation in the TouchWiz of GSIII that I would describe as &#8220;absurdly clunky&#8221;.</p>
<p>The quick contacts card is gone, the app drawer is uglier and less useful, and has way more pointless buttons and toggles. The gallery and camera are an absolute mess. Even the lockscreen is gimped. The gestures are universally not helpful, they look like you&#8217;re far more likely to trigger them accidentally than remember them and use them. <br />
Have you used a nexus? The stock implementation is almost always the better one.</p>
<p>The app drawer is pretty much stock on the S3. I have not used gallery so I can&#8217;t make any judgements but on the S1 the gallery looked almost exactly like the ICS gallery. Not sure about the camera app but the camera itself has much higher quality than the Nexus and is even better than the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>agrred, the camera app (and camera) on the S3 destroys the Nexus.  Seriously, stock has no ISO control</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why you install a different launcher, and keep all Touchwiz features except 1 or 2. Yes&#8230;this is not iOS. You can customize&#8230;</p>
<p>I mostly agree, but it&#8217;s not just about specs.  I don&#8217;t need a top-of-the-time quad-core processor, but I do ask that my phone have a great screen <em>and </em>a great camera.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Nexus only has the former.</p>
<p>the One X and S3 both have better screens and better cameras and better DAC&#8230;that&#8217;s a lot</p>
<p>Yeaaaaah GS3 and One X have far superior cameras and screens the current GNex. As they should. GNex is 9 months old. Not sure why anyone would buy one right now. Just wait for the new one at the end of the yr</p>
<p>Nothing in Jelly Bean makes me desperate to upgrade my SIII.  Nexus ain&#8217;t bad though.  Arguing about little things here.  All three are great phones.  A better question is which of the three is the best overall smartphone &#8211; not which is the best Android smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Chris is BIAS!</strong></p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>(I would buy either of these phones if using them would allow me to recommend comments on The Verge&#8217;s mobile site. )</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna assume the missing &#8220;ed&#8221; was on purpose.</p>
<p>Apparently you don&#8217;t know the background story behind &#8220;you are bias&#8221;, so here you go: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siv64r792xM" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siv64r792xM</a></p>
<p>Enjoy :)</p>
<p>No, I do, but I only thought of saying, &#8220;For your sake, I hope Mr. Patel does the same,&#8221; after I had pressed post, and then it was too late.</p>
<p>Just buy SGS3/ OneX and root, the nexus is a great phone if you want to stick it to the carrier and dont want to root, but the display and camera improvements offered in the newer phones are definitely worth the upgrade (but you need to root, stock firmwares are death)</p>
<p>I recently changed from a Galaxy Nexus to the EVO LTE (one x) and the Evo is hands down much much better. The S4 processor is simply a gem. The camera is miles better. The battery life lasts twice as long with my usage. The only problem is that it runs HTC sense. Which shouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem once HTC releases source.</p>
<p>The Bootloader is still locked, though.  It&#8217;ll be awhile before someone hacks around it.</p>
<p>Correction its been unlocked for a while now and you can go buckwild flashing to your heart&#8217;s content. Always have to check XDA and those awesome nerds over there.</p>
<p>Did you make a comparison with a Jelly Bean nexus?  Mine is pretty damn smooth.</p>
<p>We need a photo of these two face to face so we can &#8220;deal with it&#8221;-gif them.</p>
<p>The Nexus is still the best phone due to support from Google, hackability and support from the developer community.  Of course, if Google does go ahead with a &#8220;line of nexus devices&#8221; then the whole support thing my be a different story.</p>
<p>I think that, at least in the US, carriers have to be taken into account.  If the GS3 had an unlocked bootloader so it was easy to go to stock Android then I could recommend it for Verizon.  However, Verizon&#8217;s locking policy along with their not so timely updates makes sure I will not recommend it to anyone.  For Sprint, I would say it is an even race depending on user preference, since Sprint&#8217;s LTE is almost nonexistent right now.  AT&amp;T is only running HSPA+, so I would recommend the GS3 if it can access the LTE network.  T-Mobile, well, is T-Mobile and you might want to switch carriers.  If none of the carriers mattered however, I would say Galaxy Nexus all of the way because there is only 1 ecosystem to worry about, not 2.</p>
<p>Root and boot it. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Root n&#8217; boot! Root n&#8217; boot!</p>
<p>Is the back of that GNex black colour? :O</p>
<p>it&#8217;s probably using extended battery cover.</p>
<p>Ah, the black battery door.</p>
<p>Verizon shot themselves is the foot by locking the boot loader. and not following all the other major carriers and leaving it alone.<br />
I&#8217;m fairly confident that some Nexus owners that were thinking of upgrading to the SG3 have now decided not to.<br />
Stupid move on Verizon&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>Some? Sure. A significant number? Not even close.</p>
<p>bootlaoders are ALWAYS locked. even on a nexus. the word  you want is encrypted.</p>
<p>I love this piece.  Please keep more like this coming.  Thx.</p>
<p>Although nex time, I expect someone to call the other person an ignorant slut a la Point-Counterpoint.</p>
<p>The fact that this question is being asked shows you that it&#8217;s still #1</p>
<p>What?  What&#8217;s still #1?</p>
<p>Pronouns are your friend.</p>
<p>Pretty sure &#8216;it&#8217; is a pronoun. He was basically replying to the title of this post.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the only phone getting the OTA 4.1, right? So, yes, it&#8217;s still the best phone.</p>
<p>By your unit of measurement.  There are many.  Did you even read the article?</p>
<p>Yup; along with the Nexus S &amp; Motorola Xoom</p>
<blockquote>Want to get your hands on Android 4.1, Jelly Bean? Starting in mid-July, we’ll begin rolling out over-the-air updates to Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Xoom and Nexus S, and we’ll also release Jelly Bean to open source. </blockquote>

<p>No, it&#8217;s Project Butter Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Vanilla Android is the only way to go&#8230; however the problem with the GNex is that it&#8217;s made by Samsung, it&#8217;s cheap plastic housing is awful, battery life sucks, and performance is pretty weak (just look at benchmark scores compared to every other premium handset, including ones that were out around the same time).  I want a real premium, top of the line, Nexus experience like the Nexus One was, not these cheap $hitty versions since&#8230;.  ASUS?  HTC?   Please?</p>
<p>Now if the HTC One X had a complete and stable AOSP Jelly Bean ROM&#8230;</p>
<p>Give it another month or two, all we need is kernel source and for Jelly Bean to hit AOSP.</p>
<p>Agreed, GNex, Nexus S and in general samsung devices feel flimsy and cheap.they are however, very durable, still i like my devices to feel premium, my iphone has that, and my pre had it for about&#8230;2 months xD</p>
<p>I think motorola could do a great, premium feeling Nexus phone a la razor.</p>
<p>Nexus one is still the best nexus phone ever. Ahead of it&#8217;s time. Really well built and designed. It is, along with the nexus 7 and the one V (that chin!) the only android devices that have me thinking os trying android as a daily use OS (if they release a Nexus with the One V design ill buy it day one).</p>
<p>We need a vote widget below such stories.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean, end of story.</p>
<p>When the newer Nexus is released this year, it will have Jelly Bean. And BOTH of the Nexii will receive Key Lime Pie. That&#8217;s pretty much all I care about now. Pure Android the way Google intended, with all of it&#8217;s features and no overlays, skins or anything to hamper that Vanilla experience, and it&#8217;s subsequent updates. I don&#8217;t want any of that 3rd party mess anymore, and I don&#8217;t want to root specifically for custom ROMs. Quad-Core processors and polycarbonate hardware be damned.</p>
<p>what&#8217;s with the nexii popping up on web lately? nexus is already plural(or nexuses. ).</p>
<p>is it going to be several boxen of nexii now? ugh.</p>
<p>Hehe, you&#8217;re right. I keep forgetting the Nexus is plural in itself, I blame Toyota. xD</p>
<p>It all depends on your needs.  I think the biggest game changers are the camera and display.  If a great camera is important to you, get the GSIII, root it, and go find a good AOSP rom.</p>
<p>Vlad has it right. As a VZW GN user who has been happily using JellyBean (via JakeDay&#8217;s JellyBelly) for the past couple of weeks, I could never go back to ICS.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;we&#8217;re arguing where the Android bar is being set&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>An unlocked affordable phone with the most current stock operating system and decent specs sets the bar pretty high.</p>
<p>This is a great way to summarize why the GNex has so much potential this far into its lifespan.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that many of us don&#8217;t care if it currently does what I need it to do. Again I&#8217;m half justifying my One X purchase to myself but the screen, camera and LTE (on AT&amp;T mind you) are much better than the GNEX so that does matter. Would I like some buttah and Google Now? Sure but I&#8217;m fine with what I have because it&#8217;s light years faster than my EVO.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t eat vanilla icecream and I&#8217;m not overly interested in vanilla Android either.</p>
<p>I wonder why attempting to post an empty comment prompts me to enter a comment or a subject. What is this subject they speak of.</p>
<p>Yea, but Vanilla tastes a lot better than Turd (touchwiz or Sense) flavored.</p>
<p>As the owner of a GS II Epic 4G Touch, I wish I had a Nexus phone. I think this is the last GS II not updated to Android 4 ICS at this point and I&#8217;m fed up with it. There were leaked testing builds of ICS months ago for this phone but still nothing official. Where&#8217;s our update Sprint?</p>
<p>Right now I plan to buy a Galaxy Nexus from the Play store later this year when the new crop comes out. I&#8217;m done with getting stuck on old OS tech due to customizations and carrier delays.</p>
<p>&#8220;Galaxy  S II Epic 4G Touch&#8221;  &#8211; dear God, that is a mouthful.</p>
<p>GS II Epic 4G Touch&#8230;.wow !! shame on them for naming it this.</p>
<p>i waited years for android to mature. it must been such an effort for duarte and co to lift it out of  a design-stoneage where programmers decided how things look and feel. interface and experience are more important to me than mere specs. the s3 looks like the apocalypse, its interface is childish, done by mere programmers without design background and understanding. i am a programmer for years, i know and recognize my breed. it just hurts my eyes to see what they have done to a perfectly good system, its more of a mocking.</p>
<p>Just wanna say i love your work for the GNex. If you really are the guy from XDA.</p>
<p>thx dude (-:</p>
<p>Which brings us to another point. If you like to flash custom ROMs it&#8217;s better for you to get the Galaxy Nexus. Everything you need is there no problems with Bluetooth or the camera or what else could break.</p>
<p>sure man, most if not all roms come from nexus originally. they are being ported down the foodchain, in some instances even watered down loosing their teeth.</p>
<p>ICS (and soon JB) roms that is, sorry. : P</p>
<p>At $ 349.99  THIS IS THE BEST GSM PHONE IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p>PrePaid is catching up in USA. Google has the best chance to disrupt the carrier locking model if they keep the price below $ 400.00 and release an updated nexus (quad core).</p>
<p>&#8220;BEST GSM PHONE IN THE WORLD&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ughm, no.</p>
<blockquote>PrePaid is catching up in USA.</blockquote>
<p>No. It&#8217;s really not.</p>
<p>Terrible camera? Iffy screen? Lol.</p>
<p>Yes. The Galaxy Nexus has perhaps the worst camera of any flagship smartphone sold in the last two years.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re counting pixels. for what it does its perfectly alright.</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m definitely not counting pixels. I&#8217;d take a 5MP sensor with great optics over a subpar 8MP or 12MP any day.</p>
<p>While I think the GN has a pretty decent camera for what I need it to do, definitely echoing your sentiment here.</p>
<p>That being said, shutter speed on the GN is a thing to behold. It&#8217;s so great being able to snap like six shots in rapid succession.</p>
<p>When the pictures tend to be out of sharp focus, and look awful when zoomed, it&#8217;s a disappointing feature.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because they oversold the feature.  If you want an instant photo you may not get it in focus.  If you let the camera focus for a second, the pictures can at times be much better.</p>
<p>Who cares about taking a ton of crappy blurry photos?</p>
<p>Here are a couple pictures I just took the other day:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7mlhtv4tvAo/T_sJAaxS16I/AAAAAAAAAfM/02FNwpR6ovo/h120/IMG_20120707_151400.jpg" /><br />

<p>That should be a bit better.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s not the perfect camera, and i was hoping for a better sensor, but it really does what it&#8217;s supposed to do, in a very good way. The examples above are a prove of that.</p>
<p>not especially. they show that in broad daylight, it does well enough. you can see visible artifacts in the shadows of the praying mantis picture.</p>
<p>the camera is passable at best. other phones have had better cameras for a good long while. the only difference was shutter speed.</p>
<p>but that should change this year. improved horsepower, along with advances in camera tech should make for much clearer shots with zero shutter lag, as demonstrated in the SIII and One X.</p>
<p>I find that unless you&#8217;re blowing up the photos looking for artifacts, you won&#8217;t find them.  Even if you print out the photos in regular 4 &#215; 6 pictures, you&#8217;ll be pleased with the results.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t be able to print out 8.5 &#215; 11 sized pictures without visible artifacts, but they will be better than quite a few point -and-shoot cameras out there, like my grandmother&#8217;s camera for instance.</p>
<p>Haha!  Here&#8217;s a picture of my leopard lilies I took with my Galaxy Nexus.  This is early morning.</p>
<p><img src="http://i232.photobucket.com/albums/ee113/Anntagonistic/IMG_20120612_071900.jpg" /></p>
<p>So a blurry image with clipped highlights and blacks is &#8220;good&#8221;?</p>
<p>I just thought it was funny that we took a picture of the same flower.  I&#8217;m no photographer, I don&#8217;t even know what a clipped highlight is.  No need to be an asshole.</p>
<p>Sorry I replied to the wrong person. Plus it&#8217;s not yours (or anyone&#8217;s) fault that the camera can&#8217;t balance an image in daylight. My EVO 4G was atrocious and I gave up using it even in daylight.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.  No harm done :)</p>
<p>you can bet your behind not even a nikon d4 let alone a hasselblad would have done it better. thats ignorance at its best, judging pictures by its pixels and rgb values.<br />
a dlsr would have needed either a flash or hdr bracketing to render that scene balanced and that would have looked crappy nonetheless. the flower looks good, has a nice natural glow, had he separated it better from the distracting background that would have made a grand picture.</p>
<p>I was very let down with the GNEX camera, but hey I went from an iphone 4 and iphone 4s to the GNex..so maybe that was to be expected.</p>
<p>Eh&#8230;. I beg to differ. It&#8217;s an OK camera. It&#8217;s not setting any bars. It&#8217;s OK if you have the right lighting and steady hand, but nowhere as good at the iPhone or other devices</p>
<p>Its a better camera than an iphone 4, the only better cameras are the 4s, S2, S3, amaze 4G and OneX. I&#8217;m willing to trade an awesome camera for a pretty awesome one, especially given how much better the stock experience is.</p>
<p>So am I. I am happy with my iPad 2&#8217;s camera. It&#8217;s an OK camera on the Galaxy Nexus. You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s setting the bar for phones but it&#8217;s good. The phone is great and I love mine</p>
<p>every camera needs the right lightning, that doesnt even exclude a multithousanddollar hasselblad. that argument is void because all a camera does is catching light. in a perfect you should not make photos at all if you have not the right kind of light. doesnt mean manufaturers should stop advancing their technologies but its crazy out of proportion to read these statements. btw, i am a photographer owning thousands of dollars of equip, take a look <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/molesarecoming" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/molesarecoming</a> i think i would know if my nexus makes pictures more shitty than i would expect it to do.</p>
<p>Those are taken with Nexus?  Wow&#8230;.you need to give me some pointers.</p>
<p>dont be silly now. i was trying to point out the arguments are overblown. pictures are not only bound to the device that made them, in fact worlds famous photos were made with shitty analog cameras and are still being made. its great technology advances but for what its worth nexus can make good pictures if you know how. on the other hand, buy yourself a 8000 dollar d4 and they&#8217;ll still look like what pooped out of your s2 or iphone if you dont know how &#8211; and that is what is being ignored in these silly stat-wars, the human factor.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree that it&#8217;s the worst in the last 2 years, but I can admit that&#8217;s it&#8217;s hugely outclassed by the S III and One X.</p>
<p>But being worse than the best doesn&#8217;t make something bad. The camera on the GNex is acceptable and satisfies most users needs. The shutter speed alone makes it better than the Galaxy S II phone I had previously. Try taking a picture of a kid or pet with a S II slow focus and shutter speed. It was far more frustrating than the lower quality photos of the GNex.</p>
<p>Agreed. The camera software is pretty awesome on the GNex. And it most definitely is not the worst camera to come out over the past couple of years. It&#8217;s light years better than the original EVO, for one thing.</p>
<p>Another thing is, people don&#8217;t buy the Galaxy Nexus for the stellar camera. They buy it for the whole package. Now, I know this isn&#8217;t a fully valid argument but it&#8217;s something to look at</p>
<p>you left out a key word. worst &#8220;flagship&#8221; camera.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really sad is the Galaxy Nexus is worse than the camera in the GSII that came out 6 months earlier. That&#8217;s why Chris is pissed.</p>
<p>Agreed, that&#8217;s the only downside of the Nexus in my opinion.</p>
<p>Yup, unfortunately, the camera is what kept me away.</p>
<p>I hear that from a lot of people but you have to ask yourself what do you use the phone camera for and what do you expect to get out of it.  I don&#8217;t expect an SLR or even a good P&amp;S.  As long as it can give me good basic photos I am okay with it.</p>
<p>I think part of the concern is that when I upgrade phones, I expect my camera to be notably better.  I&#8217;m not expecting a SLR or a P&amp;S, but I&#8217;d like the camera to be a noticeable upgrade.</p>
<p>While I think the Galaxy Nexus had a somewhat better camera than the iPhone 4 (my previous phone), it wasn&#8217;t comparable with the iPhone 4S, or even the Galaxy S2, which came from the same damn company.</p>
<p>your expectations are all wrong.</p>
<p>You never used a Motorola Droid X, Droid X2 or Bionic I assume?  Not sure how much better the RAZR series really is either.</p>
<p>God, I have a Droid X right now and anything would be an upgrade over this piece of shit phone/camera! On 7/22 my contract is up, so this piece is super timely. Hopefully by then they will have found a workaround for the GSIII&#8217;s encrypted bootloader. That&#8217;s the only thing holding me back at the moment. The DX&#8217;s bootloader nightmare is enough to keep me away from any other encrypted phone again.</p>
<p>IT IS A CAMERA&#8230; ON A PHONE. I will never understand why people expect incredible performance out of their phone&#8217;s camera. If you want something that&#8217;s always available, use your phone. If you just want to take pictures, get a <em>camera</em>. How is this a make-or-break feature?</p>
<p>If you care enough about the difference between ICS and Jelly Bean, then you probably care enough to root your HTC One X or Galaxy S III and install a ROM with Jelly Bean and a stock-ish Google experience.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to pick one or the other &#8212; let&#8217;s just acknowledge that if you choose the HTC or Samsung experience, you&#8217;ll wait longer for upgrades. If you choose the Google experience, there&#8217;s a large community of talented hackers who keep the latest and greatest (and even old and dying) phones up to date with relative speed.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already seeing early Jelly Bean builds for the One X and S III. Fully-functioning ROMs should be here in a month or two. So the tradeoff between the latest updates and the latest hardware isn&#8217;t all that bad after all.</p>
<p>Some Galaxy S II&#8217;s have  locked bootloader</p>
<p>they&#8217;re ALL locked. only some are encrypted.</p>
<p>&#8230;and it&#8217;s trivial to unlock them. You&#8217;re technically voiding your warranty regardless, so unlocking a bootloader isn&#8217;t really an impediment to installing a stock ROM.</p>
<p>$349 &amp; Jelly Bean =&gt; YES</p>
<p>My Nexus S is still running pretty damn strong on ICS, I&#8217;m seriously impressed with it&#8217;s relative longevity despite the ageing hardware.  Definitely know that from now on whenever I consider getting a new phone it&#8217;ll be a decision between the Nexus Series and an iPhone.</p>
<p>Agreed.  When I got my Galaxy Nexus a few weeks back, it was a f&#8217;ing revelation.  I will never get a skinned Android phone ever again.  Phone makers might be getting better at producing skins, but stock is, and always will be the best route.</p>
<p>Its like the difference between a fresh windows install, and the version HP has shat all over with redundant docks, terrible wallpapers and a taskbar filled with bloatware.</p>
<p>&quot; a phone, mind you, that&#8217;s significantly outclassed by the Galaxy S III and One X — isn&#8217;t doing anyone any good.&quot; This bothers me. Because as the original iPhone showed us, hardware means nothing without good and usable software. Not saying the GSIII or One X have unusable software(I never used them) but I don&#8217;t think hardware means much. If the OS is optimized for the hardware I don&#8217;t see the issue. Jelly Bean is optimized for the hardware of the Galaxy Nexus and other Nexus devices at the moment. So it should run pretty damn well</p>
<p>three words: legitimately unlockable bootloader.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t play with roms, the ability to not only root your device for SU apps, but be able to return to stock and re-lock the device if you need to take it back to the store for some reason &#8211; and know that you will always be able to do so &#8211; is a significant bonus to geeky power users.</p>
<p>Actually, you CAN unroot certain phones (e.g. S3) and flash roms without tripping the flash counter.</p>
<p>Never dealt with an unlocked phone. Anyone care to share what the best service you can get if you buy the $349 unlocked GNex?</p>
<p>Straight Talk or T-Mobile&#8217;s &#8220;Monthly4G&#8221; plan.</p>
<p>HTC and Samsung have continually screwed up their phones. HTC messed with the backgrounding, and Samsung messed with the beam standard. Fragmentation is bad enough. Support the Nexus project!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re completely forgetting about the userbase that flashes custom ROMs such as CM. When Samsung failed to bring the S2 up to 4.0 for the longest time, I switched to CM9 and never looked back. Now that I have an S3 with ICS, I&#8217;m almost tempted to go back to CM9.</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;In the long term, we&#8217;ll be talking about the Google experience, the Samsung experience, and the HTC experience, and I feel like these OEMs are finally acquiring enough serious design talent to pull that off&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>really agree with this statement &#8211; this is how i see the andriod phone market right now &#8211; it really comes down to what user interface will i like and do i need all the extra cap that HTC and samsung for one offer</p>
<p>Jellybean and $349 trump the Galaxy SIII.  Vlad wins this round.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see anyone mentioning two of the most important reasons for using stock android: it comes with free tethering/hotspot, and there&#8217;s no carrier crapware.  For those reasons, I will continue to buy devices with stock android, unless there is a cyanogenmod build that supports all of the device&#8217;s hardware.</p>
<p>I think the problem with this is while the Galaxy Nexus might have been beat on hardware &#8211; things like the One X and the S3 have some wonderful hardware and some good stuff (like their work in the camera app) &#8211; there&#8217;s all sorts of backwards, old bits in their changes. Well, mainly HTC.</p>
<p>Allowing them to do their own tweaks is great and we keep seeing those getting incorporated in to stock Android in later versions &#8211; but then you go through the One X/S and while they&#8217;re gorgeous, functional phones, the amount of pointless changing of tiny bits &#8211; trying to make it look like Gingerbread &#8211; unpicking the beautiful design of recent versions of Android&#8230; what they give with one hand, they take back another. Maybe just a few features.</p>
<p>I suppose what I&#8217;m saying is that the Nexus gives you the best all rounders. That flying, not slowed down OS and some pretty good hardware. In fact, pretty damn awesome hardware. If you go with a third party, maybe you&#8217;ll get some better innards. Some of their great tweaks and ideas, elements, widgets, polish in places it needs it. But they&#8217;ll have made some parts of it worse. It&#8217;s not a bad compromise you have to make to choose one, but it is a choice.</p>
<p>Happy to have a Vz Gnexus off contract (through a lucky promotion), so that frees me up to buy any new phone at any time on any carrier.</p>
<p>My opinion so far is:   Must be a Nexus  (the updates are like milk and honey to my soul), and off contract.  Of course, with Verizon&#8217;s Pay-More-For-Everything pricing, this is a no brainer now, even if the phone is $700.</p>
<p>The $350 unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexus is the top phone in 2012 (overall).</p>
<p>If you are a developer and need a phone with JB on it, then sure, this phone is the deal.  But if you are not and you are a regular user or power user, you might have a different perspective.  I would call myself an Android Phone power user.</p>
<p>I need a lot from a phone.  I first need it to be a good phone, after that, I have to have lots of room to carry music, TV and movie files since I live on the fringe of the cellular network and often do not have good cell coverage.  When I do have coverage, I need the most speed I can get, because when I am out of the house, I am busy and I need to get things done.</p>
<p>So in a nutshell, the lack of removable storage pretty much takes out the Nexus for me.  On all other fronts, its a matter of features for my primary area.  Where I live, I have been using the Galaxy Note with great success because I need and like the bigger screen.  But, I must also have a couple of phones as I am the product manager for an app where I must do testing.  So I have several phones including the nexus and the GS III, GS II, RAZR and others.  I believe the top phone for me is the GS III.  I swap sims and carry it out most of the time.</p>
<p>So, bottom line, how and where you are using it still makes importance as the criteria for best phone, not just a list of features of which some might be good and others not so good.</p>
<p>Completely agree with Chris &#8230; Vlad and Josh Galaxy Nexus is not the best phone, best value sure.</p>
<p>steve jobs said it himself&#8230;.<br />
you build great hardware, and other catch up.<br />
but if you build great software, you can be 5 years ahead</p>
<p>we saw that with the iphone. took everybody 4 years to catch up</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that have anything to do with this debate?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m saying&#8230;.the hardware differences between the nexus and the S3 arent that significant</p>
<p>its the software that counts!<br />
look at the JB update for the Nexus. it feels like a completely new  phone, because its so fast and slick.</p>
<p>the S3 wont get that update for another 6 months.<br />
the S-voice crap is just inferior to what JB has to offer&#8230;&#8230;<br />
&#8230;.and by the time the S3 gets JB, its obsolete, because google has already released 4.2</p>
<p>Oh. Yeah. Then you&#8217;re right. The software is what counts</p>
<p>I strongly disagree with chris (sorry bro)<br />
I personally care more about software than hardware.</p>
<p>so I&#8217;d rather have outdated hardware, than outdated software.<br />
because software is mightier than hardware&#8230;.</p>
<p>its not like the Nexus is a BAD phone&#8230;..and especially with JB, the performance got insanely good<br />
now we&#8217;ve got to wait until end of the year to get JB on the S3, which is insane&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Google will probably release the next android version in about 6 months</p>
<p>thats the whole point. you will NEVER get jellybean on the S3 just as the S2 never got ice cream sandwhich. you&#8217;re getting android 4.1, which is a technicallity, but jellybean is more than that, it is the newest in terms of UI and UX design and device interoperability.</p>
<p>what are u talking about?<br />
the S2 got ICS<br />
and I&#8217;m sure the S3 will get JB&#8230;..<br />
&#8230;its just gonna take forever</p>
<p>i own the S2. it got touchwizz. read the article above, i basically reiterated his point.</p>
<p>what do you think was named &#8220;ice cream sandwhich&#8221; or &#8220;jellybean&#8221; by google? the mere java framework or the unix underbelly?</p>
<p>Nice point.    Probably too subtle for most of the crowd, and I&#8217;m not sure Google would agree.  Does Google restrict the usage of the names?</p>
<p>no they dont. but its clear that design is a paid good that manifests in real world products. to say touchwizz = ice cream sandwich because it is based on the same java framework, a mere technicality, but is stripped off completely by everything else, months of hard work from durte and his team, that is just not right. their guidelines are up on android.com explaining the smallest details and how they interact, forming a whole. samsung went against it completely, even reversing it piece by piece. that they called it &#8220;ice cream sandwich&#8221; is actually pretty tasteless,</p>
<p>sorry, i meant &#8220;respectless,&#8221; not tasteless. alot of people criticised them for that move because it created a wrong impression, they basically took the good name/reputation and sold it to the public without delivering any of its actual promises.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re all missing the important question here: How did they not name this series &#8220;diVERGEing Opinions&#8221;?!?</p>
<p>TOPOLSKY!! Hear this guy!</p>
<p>Where did you guys get this picture from that has the watermark on it. ?????</p>
<p>All I need is a SD card slot in the next Nexus device, and I&#8217;m sold.</p>
<p>Prepare to be disappointed. It&#8217;s all about the cloud with Google.</p>
<p>With the SIII bootloader being locked for Verizon, the Galaxy Nexus is the answer for me.</p>
<p>The consensus among commenters here seems to be that they prefer a stock, or at least toned-down (e.g. CM) Android experience and I am inclined to agree. Vlad brings up a good point about the irony of developers having to work to remove manufacturer UIs&#8230; most people end up customizing their devices with launchers and icons anyway, assuming they don&#8217;t go the ROM route. Frankly, manufacturer UIs wouldn&#8217;t be such a bone to pick if they didn&#8217;t prevent the release of timely updates.</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus for the motherf&#8217;n win!</p>
<p>um &#8230; CM9 beats AOKP for the fact alone that AOKP is based on it in huge parts. CM9 do more than kanging bits and pieces from other teams repos, they invent stuff and advcance android. its kinda sad AOKP took the cake.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? AOKP is built from AOSP not CM9.</p>
<p>aokp is taking in masses of cm code. not that theres anything wrong about it now is it.</p>
<p>Stock Android is nice and all&#8230; but nothing&#8230; NOTHING beats AOKP</p>
<p><a href="http://aokp.co" target="_blank">http://aokp.co</a></p>
<p>I will NEVER use a skinned version of Android nor will I ever use stock android. I will only use custom roms and AOKP for as long as possible!</p>
<p>CM9 &gt;&gt; AOKP<br />
just sayin&#8217;</p>
<p>to each his own, thats the beauty of it. but i feel like AOKP gives me a lot more features. after all it is based off cm9 haha. i just love roman and how quickly they update</p>
<p>To each their own, indeed. AOKP &gt; CM9 for me.<br />
<strong><br />
FEEL THE SWAGGER!</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never buy a non-Nexus phone again unless its a thoroughly hackable phone with great driver support.</p>
<p>Faster hardware means nothing if the manufacturer or networks decide to drag their feet or remove software support.</p>
<p>Awesome feature! Love the back and forth! Go Verge!</p>
<p>I was using Galaxy S with CM9. I was happy with Android. I was recommending Android to my friends and coleagues. I knew touchwiz wasnt much good but it seemed OK on SGSII.</p>
<p>I got SGSIII, touchwiz was ok in beginning, but from pure ICS (even pure Gingerbread!) it was downgrade as hell &#8230; in fluidness user experience SGS1 ICS was more fluid than SGS3 with touchwiz for me.</p>
<p>Many my friends are unhappy with their SGS2 (bugginess, reboots etc). They dont know about new android versions, but they are not happy with their device.</p>
<p>This situation is not acceptable anymore, its time to stop giving samsung and htc pass.</p>
<p>From now there are no other Android devices than Nexus(or pure Android) &#8230; I will never recommend any non-nexus android device &#8230; better iphone than them.</p>
<p>Ask your friends with Androids &#8230; are they happy with their phone? Are nexus owners happy? &#8230; I know I am (with CM9 on SGS3). And I know I wouldnt be happy with touchwiz.</p>
<blockquote>Yes, the Galaxy S III is running an operating system based on Android 4.0, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d call it an Android 4.0 phone — it&#8217;s an Android-based phone running Nature UX.</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m thinking.. and I think that&#8217;s what makes the Galaxy Nexus superior if you want an Android phone.. the others simply <strong>aren&#8217;t</strong> Android phones!! They are phones with OSes made by the manufacturers, only based on Android.</p>
<p>Do they become Android phones if you put an AOSP-based ROM on them?</p>
<p>YES. Touchwiz phone isnt Android phone for me. Google should ban them from marketing them as Androids. At max &#8220;powered by Android&#8221;</p>
<p>In my mind, yes.</p>
<p>Fair enough. I wasn&#8217;t trying to be sarcastic, I was legitimately curious :)</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus with Jellybean will feel faster than any other device unless you have a stopwatch.</p>
<p>While there might be advantages to other phones, I can see a very strong case for the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts, in a nutshell:</p>
<p>Software can be changed, <em>hardware </em>cannot.  Though greatly tempted by the unlocked Galaxy Nexus, I couldn&#8217;t get over the fact that the One X has a notably better screen and camera.  These hardware features are probably the most important features to me, and while one of them individually may not be enough to tempt me, the fact that <em>both </em>are substantially better on the One X was just too hard to ignore.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t understand why Samsung and Google insisted on putting such a sub-par camera in the Galaxy Nexus.  The screen is understandable, as it was best-in-class at the time of release and is still quite good, but the camera is just inexcusable.  The fact the One X has greatly superior out-of-the-box camera <em>software </em>just sealed the deal for me.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;ll get Jellybean, either officially or unofficially, soon enough.  It won&#8217;t be as fast as the Nexus, of course, but that was a price I knew I&#8217;d pay when I decided to get the One X.  And, despite how awesome Jellybean looks &#8211; I&#8217;m okay with that.  I&#8217;d rather have better hardware that takes longer to get updates, then lesser hardware that will be updated faster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d rather have better hardware that takes longer to get updates, than lesser hardware that will be updated faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m on the opposite side of that divide, I want the latest and greatest software as soon as possible, and I&#8217;m willing to compromise with a &#8220;crappy&#8221; 720p display, and an admittedly inferior camera with great software (it snaps shots quick, and the new film roll style picture view makes getting between your pictures and the camera incredibly fast and convenient compared to ICS, this might be the most understated feature in JellyBean and one not likely to appear in other manufacturers phones).</p>
<p>So you take your compromise on the software, I&#8217;ll take mine on the hardware.</p>
<p>Seems fair :)  That&#8217;s why consumer choice is such a great thing!  It&#8217;s all about what fits you best, which I think is the real take-away from this article.</p>
<p>Contrary to common believe the camera, just like the screen, was about average when it came out. I put it up 1 vs 1 against the Galaxy S2 for example it is just as good. On some aspects it is better than the iPhone 4S&#8217;es camera (although it can&#8217;t beat it overall.)</p>
<p>To me, the utterly bad camera of the Galaxy Nexus is more a myth than a fact. Of course it is no match to the ONE X&#8217;s camera and neither it is screen-wise.</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t. The hardware lacks and the software can be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>For us maybe. But what about your friends which does not know how to replace SW and dont want to burn warranty?</p>
<p>Agreed on that.  Different strokes for different folks.  I&#8217;d gladly recommend the Galaxy Nexus to anyone who was curious about Android, especially since you can get one commitment-free.</p>
<p>Then they don&#8217;t even worry about this problem..</p>
<p>GNex is the best experience. Experience = 2/3 of performance. SO GNex won from One X or SIII.</p>
<p>I do think Vlad made one very important point that Chris ignored, that the praise for Samsung and HTCs latest skin was all about their restraint.</p>
<p>Well, not <em>all </em>the praise.  The One X&#8217;s camera software is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Have you used JellyBeans new camera software? It&#8217;s a big improvement over ICS</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say I have.  Does it have a burst mode like the One X&#8217;s?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried third-party apps with so-called &#8220;burst mode&#8221;, but none of them take full-quality pics like the One X&#8217;s does.</p>
<p>No burst mode, but it takes pictures fast enough that I just tap the button a few times in a row and get at least 3-4 shots a second.</p>
<p>Then getting to your pictures is just a quick scroll to the left, pinch to zoom out, and flick the ones you don&#8217;t like off the screen. and scroll to the right to get back to your camera. I love that I don&#8217;t have to leave the camera app to look at the recently taken pictures.</p>
<p>Nice!  Maybe that means I can confidently migrate to an AOSP-based ROM once JB-based ones are available.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gifbin.com/981169"><img src="http://gifs.gifbin.com/191950334.gif" alt="funny gifs" /></a></p>
<p>Just wanted to  thank the Verge for articles like this.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Well, the moment Chris said &#8220;We need to get away from the notion that OEMs are producing Android devices with crappy skins and embrace the reality, which is that they&#8217;re not far off from what Amazon has done with the Kindle Fire.&#8221; I stopped hearing what he was saying, and only heard &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about.&#8221; The Kindle Fire is a terrible bastardization of Android. It&#8217;s inferior to even the Gingerbread on which it&#8217;s based in every possible way, to say nothing of ICS or JB.</p>
<p>you basically just summed up his point.</p>
<p>No, his point is that OEM&#8217;s are no longer producing crappy skins, and are instead doing things more like what Amazon did. What Amazon did was terrible, so why would we want to compare HTC or Samsung to that?</p>
<p>My white Galaxy Nexus is sexy. Bring on Jelly Bean!</p>
<p>I have been a fan of Sense over the last few years, with the original Incredible,and most recently, the Rezound.  After the announcement of JB, for some odd reason, the stock look started to appeal to me a lot more.  I decided to make the switch.  I added a 3rd line to my VZ acct to keep my unlimited data, went, traded in my Rezound and walked out with a Nexus.  That was 2 days ago, and I must say, now that I am running JB, I have absolutely no regrets about abandoning Sense.  My days of waiting for updates to take months are over.</p>
<p>My comment was already made in the article. It&#8217;s obviously no longer the best Android phone any more if you want to talk performance and specs. I still love it though, and Jelly Bean made it feel like a whole new phone.</p>
<p>Chris. Let me ask you something:</p>
<p>How come you make such a big deal about GS3 and One X having so much better and more powerful hardware. And yet you&#8217;re not hold the Lumia 900 to the same standard, which is even lower than the Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>Just because it&#8217;s the &#8220;flagship&#8221; of Nokia and WP7 in general, doesn&#8217;t mean it lives in a vacuum or a whole other universe where new Android phones and iPhones don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s preferences and priorities are different, as pictured perfectly in the article. I&#8217;m a former Android user now iOS. I just wanted regular updates, simple UI, and great hardware, which my iPhone 4 has succeeded spectacularly. Perhaps a Nexus device or the variety of flagship models might match what I want, but I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of people who want something different, as reflected by differing sales, most popular apps, etc. The iPhone 4 has aged well considering it was released almost 2 years ago, which is ages in the smartphone market, and the small things mean a lot for the overall experience. I have yet to try 4.1, but I&#8217;m sure it has improved tremendously, probably not as big from 2.3 to 4.0, but great nonetheless. I&#8217;ll probably give the HTC One X a chance, but enough of my friends and family use iPhones to make iMessage useful and I&#8217;ve already integrated enough that I don&#8217;t want to switch again.</p>
<p>So what was the final answer?</p>
<p>What is best for you?  Do you want better hardware with less-frequently-updated software, or lesser hardware with software that&#8217;s always up to date?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s your answer.</p>
<p>No it really isn&#8217;t that simple,  the skin counts too. It helps providing a coherent user experience with the Holo themed apps. You won&#8217;t see any Sense themed apps, or  Nature UX themed apps.</p>
<p>Also one point that people seem to downplay a lot, the software navigation buttons are more useful than you&#8217;d think. They enable developers to create truly useful mods on it.</p>
<p>And finally, the clean black front of the Nexus is just priceless for an Android phone, its totally free from any form of manufacturer branding.</p>
<p>I agree with Vlad. I own an HTC One V but were it not for the superior camera and display, I would have probably bought a Nexus S instead because Sense is probably the worst part of the phone. Sense looks alright and certainly more effort has been put into it than other Android skins but stock Android still looks better in my opinion and it also messes with the fact that the main interface is going to look completely inconsistent compared to all the new Android apps that will be coming out.</p>
<p>Though I spose that in this respect, LG and Samsung are doing better with their skins than HTC because at least their skins tie in with the underlying theme of Android 4.&#215;.</p>
<p>There is the updates thing as well; HTC have promised loads of updates but they haven&#8217;t yet delivered, which is disappointing as two thirds of a year have now gone since the release of ICS. Samsung, as far as I am aware, are doing even worse. This is just unacceptable, not to mention that the iPhone 3GS is getting iOS 6 while there isn&#8217;t a single Android phone from 2010 or earlier, not even the Nexus One, getting Android 4.0.</p>
<p>HA <blockquote>ADDING INSULT TO UX INJURY</blockquote> &#8211; best line ever. Get em Vlad!!!</p>
<p>I may be partial considering I&#8217;ve owned both the Nexus One and GNex, but I still think the GNex is the best overall Android experience you can get right now. So much so that I just bought my second GNex a week ago after my original was water-damaged. I thought it would be a tougher decision given the amazing hardware of the One X and the S3, and the fact that I&#8217;ve been off-contract for over two years and could get a subsidized phone. Yes, the One X and SIII have amazing hardware that, no doubt, outclasses the GNex, but I&#8217;m talking hardware AND software. I&#8217;m more concerned about having updates coming directly from Google and having all the new neat features without having to root or ROM to get them.</p>
<p>I agree with Vlad. The hardware is poor by today&#8217;s standards despite having the latest software. Uninspired design, average camera and pentile screen. Hardly best in class.</p>
<p>That said, 4.1 on the Nexus probably runs smoother than 4.0 on the HOX/GSIII.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep my Gnex. When the Galaxy series first came out, I had high hopes, and bought a Fascinate as soon as it was available. Obviously I knew I was going to root it immediately because of Bing, and I flashed a custom ROM to get Froyo months ahead of the official update, and did the same for Gingerbread, and now its got ICS on it and there is no update for that available.</p>
<p>When I got the Gnex it was over a month before I flashed it. I was so impressed that it was everything the Fascinate wasn&#8217;t, and the difference for me was stock ICS.</p>
<p>If you are content to run a stock ROM, then I guess the SIII would be your cup of tea. But being a Nexus device makes up for a lot.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no such thing as a counterping</p>
<p>This seems like apples and oranges to me. When a manufacturer puts their own gadgets on top of it they are trying to distinguish from one another. As far as I can tell people here and in general who have used stock android have found it to be less intrusive. That being said, people I know who have never used stock android love the experience of Sense or Nature UX, and would live and die by them.</p>
<p>Besides, the Galaxy Nexus should never have been the best android phone for more than a few months because the purpose of it is to move the entire android ecosystem forward. The fact that the debate between the stock android experience and manufacture specific skins means to me that the OEMs can def do better.</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned the Nexus devices and firmwares are how Google wants the platform to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 100% with Chris Ziegler. The Galaxy Nexus has great software, but the internals wasn&#8217;t even close to the top when it was released, and is painfully dated compared to the Galaxy S3 and the One X.</p>
<p>Software you can update, Hardware in a phone you have to live with.</p>
<p>dont forget youre actually using these phones in daily lives. i know it can be easy to get lost in stat jerkoffs but lets face it, most if not all apps run well on the nexus. when the next generation comes, nexus will see its replacement aswell. in the meantime youre left with a phone, which more or less works for you. nexus was envisioned by professionals in their craft, its just that good. s3 has great internals but software that draws from the past.</p>
<p>The S3 will get JB, sure a lot faster for us Europeans than the unlucky North Americans, but still. The Galaxy Nexus will be stuck with non-expandable storage, a mediocre camera, mediocre sound and a slow processor. That&#8217;s why I wouldn&#8217;t go for a Galaxy Nexus today.</p>
<p>again, it will not. jellybean is months of hard work to advance user-interface and user-experience design. jellybean is a whole, you cannot simply cut out 90% of its nature, take the boring java framework and say youre on jb. it does not work that way even though samsung likes to make its customers think it does. what you will get is touchwizz, which can safely be considered the worst operating system that android has to offer and even if you happen to like it, it is far from being jellybean. as for nexus being mediocre, meh, i dont think so and stats wont convince me either. i own the &#8220;superior&#8221; s2 aswell, with is &#8220;great&#8221; gardware and &#8220;great&#8221; camera. again, meh.</p>
<p>Why? The key features will be in the TouchWiz update, that is Google Now and Voice Search along with the improved hardware acceleration and app updates. People who are used to TouchWiz prefer TouchWiz as a general UI. Remember, Samsung did incorporate really useful things like Notifications bar apps, lock screen apps, resizable widgets and such. A lot of the stuff you see in stock Android is often borrowed from custom UI&#8217;s like TW or Sense. Calling TouchWiz the &#8220;worst ever&#8221; is a bit narrow-minded. Sure, the features Samsung use in advertisements are often gimmicky, but that&#8217;s the nature of advertisements (to mention the brand and easy to remember features as often as possible in 30 seconds).</p>
<p>The camera on the Gnex is worse than the Galaxy S2, so is the processor, and shockingly even the audio DAC. The screen on the GNex is not on par with the Galaxy S3. As I said, my personal preference is to have the best hardware possible and then use software updates to improve the user experience as much as possible after that. Starting out with mid-range hardware will limit your experience. The key features of JB will be available on the Galaxy S3, and you get to keep the superior hardware in the process.</p>
<p>its not about key features. ics/jellybean were thought through down to the smallest element. google hired professionals to do it. its all documented on developer.android.com and you can read the guidelines there if it interests you. they made a huge effort to introduce android into our modern time including all our contemporary knowledge in regards to UI/UX. THAT is jellybean. samsung did not just take it not, no, they decided to break each and every design rule they could find on the adress i have give you. they reversed matias duartes/googles work, but insisted to use their name for marketing purposes. what you will get is an OS made my design amateurs, mere programmers did that. im a programmer for years and worked in GUI teams, i recognize it on the spot. as someone here said it best, samsung would rather be different than take the best, touchwizz is a pure marketing related decision. superior said &#8220;hey, you there, the programmer back in the corner, we need to be different, take aosp and slap some self made pngs over it, change what you see fit!&#8221;</p>
<p>as for camera, its good enough. heres my photo portfolio: <a href="http://500px.com/molesarecoming" target="_blank">http://500px.com/molesarecoming</a> i invested thousands of dollars in equipment and i think i would know if my gnex would take worse pictures than my s2. and well, i own both anyway. if i count pixels the s2 is arguably &#8220;better&#8221; but i dont and both are <del>ok</del> for what they are intended to.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re perfectly entitled to your opinion. But, yes, to me an da lot of others, the hardware features far outshine the software abilities. Especially as we know that Samsung will update the S3 to JB. At least the non-US models =)</p>
<p>The only real reason to get a Galaxy Nexus over a SGS3 is if you just have to be first with software updates.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that Samsung also add really useful features that you have ot pay money for on pure android, like Swype, Dropbox, competing music and video  subscriptions, remote security and management and tons of other stuff you wont get with pure Android.</p>
<p>I can understand that an disproportionally large percentage are pro-Nexus at a site like this. But in the &#8220;real world&#8221;, where people buy for what it can do today and not potentially in 2 years. the numbers are hugely in favour of TouchWiz and the S3. TouchWiz is not &#8220;pure marketing&#8221;, it&#8217;s the best hardware specific Android version. Just admit that first, and I&#8217;ll agree with you that JB is the best Android version to date.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny that you insist on being content with mediocre hardware features but get upset if the FW is updated a few months later on the better device. =) Sorry, I just cant understand those priorities.</p>
<p>btw here&#8217;s the full link: <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/design/index.html</a><br />
the jellybean reference is not yet up there sadly. its an interesting read and it shows how much effort and passion flows into the design, which of course is not limited to the mere visual aspect but also the way you handle your device. <br />
touchwizz does not adhere to most if not any of it, which is fine as they can and shall do to it whatever they want but still, to say touchwizz = jellybean because samsung chose to base on android-unix 4.1 is void.</p>
<p>If you read today though, the S2 may not be getting Jelly Bean so what does that say about the S3? I&#8217;d far rather have slighty worse specs but a superior OS than the other way round.</p>
<p>Samsung are &#8220;a greedy hardware company&#8221; like any other. They want to sell new phones. The S2 more than a year old and they will of course try to get people to upgrade. All manufacturers play that software limiting game on old devices, including Apple.</p>
<p> Well the Nexus S is getting Jelly Bean next week and the identically spec&#8217;d Galaxy S didn&#8217;t even get ICS. I think that&#8217;s a pretty good indication about what&#8217;s going to happen to the GS2 and the GS3.</p>
<p>Exactly. Instead of benchmarks how about a browser shoot-out or a comparison in apps. Most days I don&#8217;t even load any games. I&#8217;m sending texts, sending emails, using the browser, and navigating with Google Maps. How about some real world use case comparisons?</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll laugh but nexus is great for games, even the latest. they play not just fine, they play lag-less and fluid. i think this hole &#8220;i have the better stats&#8221; thing is being actively stirred by the manufactures, trying to beat each other with greater numbers and figures if they play an actual role or not.</p>
<p>Agreed. I do have several on my phone and they all run perfect from what I can tell when I do play them. Hoping they&#8217;ll run even better on my Nexus 7.</p>
<p>*whole</p>
<p>Can you provide some tangible difference with that superior hardware? Higher benchmark? 0.5 seconds faster in launching apps?</p>
<p>Seriously, learn to look pass the &#8220;hardware carrot&#8221;. You don&#8217;t need top of the line hardware to run Android, and the apps. Just like you don&#8217;t need i7 and GTX580 to enjoy using a desktop. It&#8217;s a way for the manufacturers to make you buy their phones.</p>
<p>In turn you&#8217;re deprived of Google&#8217;s own vision on Android, especially all the hard work on UI design that has gone into making Android wonderful.</p>
<p>Is it still the best android phone? I think so, mostly due to future proofing. The software updates Android has been coming out with have been huge in terms of performance boosts. No one had really expected as big of a boost as 4.1 brings(especially considering the boost 4.0 had brought) and now I can only expect Google to continue focusing on performance boosts. Android is no longer in such a desperate need to increase specs in order to increase performance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d put the Nexus devices from here on out as the top Android device until manufactures figure out how to put out updates within a shorter time frame than the 6+months they&#8217;ve been doing. Reason being that by the time updates finally do start coming out, the next version of Android is already baking and will be out soon after.</p>
<p>Software and UX is more important than specs.<br />
Samsung makes great hardware, but they&#8217;re not a software company and they shouldn&#8217;t pretend to be one. Just look at S-Voice.<br />
The SIII is a product of marketing, and the requirement to differentiate products from competitors. They would much rather have a different product than a better product.</p>
<p>When was Galaxy Nexus released?<br />
When was SGS III released?</p>
<p>Which one has the latest and greatest software?</p>
<p>Which one provides the smoothness experience?</p>
<p>Which one has the better specs?</p>
<p>Okay once you answered those questions answer this, in a year from now will you have the same answers for those questions?</p>
<p>Answer is yes.</p>
<p>The Nexus S has a longer shelve life and will continue to have a longer shelve life than the SGS and the SGSII. For one reason software does more for better experience than hardware.</p>
<p>This time next year SGSIII owners will be complaining a cursing samsung for the lack of updates, Nexus owners will be enjoying the greatest and latest.</p>
<p>*shelf</p>
<p>I will stick with Windows Phone.</p>
<p>How do you like windowns 7.8 or 7.5 whatever micro is telling you it is (its still windows 7 by the way)</p>
<p>Oh I do not have one (yet) but I look to the  Heavens and ask it for a HTC Zenith.</p>
<p>you realize that if you where to have WP8 on a device with no dual core processor or no NFC is pretty ludacris</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bring sense into the fanboy wars, it never works. I love my Galaxy Nexus, but people just don&#8217;t understand that WP8 is just WP7.8 with support for NFC/Multi-Core/higher resolution screens&#8230;  The only thing that I&#8217;m not 100% sure about is whether 7.8 will get native DirectX support, which is the <em>one</em> thing that it needs to in order to be on par with WP8</p>
<p>hey I am an Android guy too (have a budget 2.3.3 tab) and love it i just wish the upgrade system worked like Windows does. I just do not like Apple. That is why I love bluestacks and Windows 8.</p>
<p>Blackberry all the way baby! Ha, just kidding.</p>
<p>I will only purchase Nexus or perhaps other stock devices.</p>
<p>Without question it&#8217;s the best. Until a new Nexus phone is released.</p>
<p>I can buy 2 Galaxy Nexuses for the price of 1 Galaxy S 3.<br />
Just think about that for a second.</p>
<p>I am still in GB but once TouchWiz started growing in me, I feel stock too blank. To start with &#8211; no speed dial (wonder how can Google skip this). The TW swype left/right on contacts is just a blessing feature. Swype any direction to unlock is cool. Swype to directly go to SMS, Email is nice. Maybe these are addressed in later version of Android. But for GB, TW is a life saver.</p>
<p>Having just purchased a Galaxy Nexus I remain happy with this purchase. Admittedly I am biased against non-nexus phones having had a Galaxy S with poor support from Samsung. While Samsung and others are making great improvements to their android distributions, I never was and still am underwhelmed by the modifications and design decisions they have made. Not that I am totally agasint OEM modifications as I was a huge fan of Sense from HTC when it came out. Those of us who were early adopters of the G1 probably remember how cool Sense was when it came out. Android has improved leaps and bounds since then.</p>
<p>But I always run Cyanogenmod and honestly, the decision came down to the soft buttons on the Galaxy Nexus as well its availability as an inexpensive off-contract phone. Almost chose the SGSIII for the camera and speed but the Nexus just seemed liked the better long term investment.</p>
<p>The article seems to only focus on software. A good phone also requires good hardware. I&#8217;ve heard many Gnex owners complain about bad reception, low speaker volume, low quality camera, and bad battery life. I mean software can only get you so far. If we were talking about tablets, these hardware issues wouldn&#8217;t be so prominent.</p>
<p>Personally,  I really wanted a Galaxy Nexus for the AOSP experience and to be first for software updates, but after reading reviews for it and other phones, I decided against it. I got the HTC Rezound instead and I&#8217;m happy with it.</p>
<p>Yes, the Gnex has no expandable memory, yes the Gnex hasn&#8217;t a good camera, yes the Gnex has an outdated processor. But the better OS/UI compensate this all to make this the better phone of all.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a good one. Unfortunately, your perspective in this &#8220;debate&#8221; concerning the GNex vs. SGS3 is simply <em>wrong</em>. :-p While the &#8220;pure Google experience&#8221; has not always been superior to the various manufacturer-modified versions and hence an ideal choice for most consumers, with the introduction of Android 4.1, it now seems quite clear that it will be.</p>
<p>Give the Galaxy Nexus a better camera and un-Samsungy build quality (granted my aging Galaxy S only has a few scrapes on the back and sides but it&#8217;s still too flimsy for my liking)  and you have the best android phone out there.</p>
<p>Vlad&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m furios that my Galaxy S didn&#8217;t get ICS despite still being a pretty damn quick phone. The Nexus S is getting ICS; hell, the iPhone 3GS is getting updated to iOS 6 so why am I stuck with 2.3? Because Samsung are lazy and can&#8217;t be arsed looking after their customers. Well, guess what Samsung, you&#8217;ve just lost a customer (unless you make the next galaxy phone).</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus also has a pretty terrible screen, and it&#8217;s GPU is woefully inadequate. It&#8217;s camera is also pretty bad.</p>
<p>The only thing it has going for it is the physical size of the screen, and the new OS updates which are free from ugly skins.</p>
<p>pretty terrible screen JUST SAY WHAT? good grace i was blown away by it. man technology must be really progressing if the display that was referred as the most awesome that the smartphone world has to offer by the time it came out is considered terrible today. : D</p>
<p>gpu inadequate, dude, inadequate for what. would you please name the apps that dont run on your nexus? i havent seen any that dont including latest-gen 3d games.</p>
<p>camera, meh. show me your pictures and lets see i might be able to give you a hint.</p>
<p>Pentile screens are dreadful, they really shouldn&#8217;t still be in service. Tiny though it is, the screen on my ancient iPhone 4 is streets ahead of the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>As for the GPU, look at the specs if you need proof. The GPU in the Nexus is much slower than the GPU in the 4S, and the 4S is pretty dated now.</p>
<p>dude, who cares about stats. dont waste your time. theres no trouble with subpixels if youre not searching for it with a magnifying glass, the display is staggering. gpu plays all the latest games fluidly so whats the big deal.</p>
<p>You lose credibility when you make statements like &#8220;pretty terrible screen&#8221;.  Every review has noted that the GN screen looks great (perhaps not up to 1X standards, but still very good).  Being pentile doesn&#8217;t matter when you have to hold the phone 3 inches from you face and squint to make out the difference.</p>
<p>Coming from using the iPhone 4 for years, I&#8217;m used to nice screens. The Galaxy Nexus screen just doesn&#8217;t compare, it looks gritty and messy. The retina display is streets ahead, I just wish it was bigger.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve refrained from commenting on this article because I think everyone has their own reason for preferring one over the other, but this comment is just completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8220;pretty terrible screen&#8221;? Have you ever SEEN a galaxy nexus?? I use one every single day and the screen is EASILY the best screen on a mobile device I have ever seen. Pentile has nothing to do with it. With a comment like that, it&#8217;s clear that you&#8217;ve never used a GN.</p>
<p>I have used a Galaxy Nexus, but I don&#8217;t own one. A friend of mine has one and likes to show me how much better it is than my iPhone 4. It is indeed better in many ways, but the quality of the screen certainly isn&#8217;t one of them.</p>
<p>I have the Nexus and I love it.  I also love the Samsung S3 and Galaxy Note.    I look at it this way.  It&#8217;s one less phone being sold to Apple; the true enemy to Android.  <br />
My concern is getting Motorola and HTC on the same page.  Look at the Miami Heat.  Having 2 1/2 great players and a good bench wins championships.  I don&#8217;t want Samsung to do it all alone because one injury (Derrick Rose with the Chicago Bulls) will knock you out of the playoffs in the first round.  Imagine if the next iPhone was a total dud.  That mistake would be catastrophic for Apple.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting worried that the multi-Nexus device rumor will turn out to just be the PDK and we won&#8217;t get 5 different Nexus devices released after all.</p>
<p>the ONLY things that apple does better than google is closing off their ecosystem and their build quality.</p>
<p>iPhones are made of high quality materials like metal and glass, whereas 90% of android phones are made of cheap plastic (looks at samsung). In addition to this, all the iphones are designed very similar to eachother, so 3rd party accessories are easily made for the platform.</p>
<p>By closing off their ecosystem, developers only have to worry about making apps compatible with a select few devices (iPhone and iPad and their older variants). <br />
In comparison, everyone and their mom makes android devices. The hardware they put on their devices is their own choice. Because of this, developers have to choose the more popular devices to support. This effects the phone update process aswell. Some android phones may never get updated, so unless you buy a nexus series phone you can never be sure. <br />
All iOS devices get updated for at least 2 generations after.</p>
<p>Other than this, iOS lacks in many ways:<br />
-No way of putting attachments into already open draft emails <br />
-no way of downloading files off of the internet <br />
-no way of disabling the text message sending sound (without disabling all sounds)<br />
-no way of setting everything on silent quickly (gotta set it all individually in the options menu)</p>
<p>Even blackberry 5 has most of these basic features.</p>
<p>Hopefully when the rumoured Nexus line comes out this autumn we won&#8217;t need to have this debate, as long as the OEMs go hard on specs.</p>
<p>I hate to say someone&#8217;s opinion is wrong&#8230; But Chris is wrong. I&#8217;ve owned HTC and Samsung phones, both with Sense and TouchWiz. It wasn&#8217;t until I owned the Nexus S that I discovered what Android was meant to be. Hardware is great, but if you don&#8217;t have good software, the phone is gonna run like shit anyway. My Nexus S ran at a smooth 60fps most of the time, while my Evo 3D used to struggle to hit 30fps. So last year, the stock Android experience was superior simply because of performance. The Galaxy S III&#8217;s grating &#8220;nature UX&#8221; is so intrusive, it&#8217;s annoying, and Sense just looks outdated. Both of the new skins run just fine, but are far less visually appealing than stock ICS or JB. The icons in Sense STILL look like they should belong on Windows XP. I know it&#8217;s a small gripe, but as a graphic designer, I just couldn&#8217;t purchase either one of those devices knowing that I have to look at gradient-crazy, faux glass, visuals every day. Then there&#8217;s the whole update situation. My Nexus S had ICS before the Galaxy S III came out, and my new Galaxy Nexus is already running Jelly Bean. The work done on the backend of Android with 4.1 make the aging GNex just as smooth (if not more so) than the GSIII or the One X, all but rendering their powerful specs completely irrelevant. What&#8217;s the point of having the specs if they don&#8217;t translate to a smoother user experience? There isn&#8217;t one. Now, if the Galaxy SIII ends up getting 4.1 in the next few weeks, then it&#8217;ll be a truly formidable device. But it won&#8217;t. The GSIII and One X will be lucky to get 4.1 when the next version of Android (key lime pie?) drops. By then, the Galaxy Nexus will be lined up to receive KLP while the GSIII and One X will just be getting JB. I&#8217;m not going out on a limb here. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s gonna happen. I&#8217;ll take state of the art software over hardware any day, because in the end, it&#8217;s what ends up on screen and how THAT functions that interests me. You can have a quad core under the hood, but if the UI, and software features are slower, less enjoyable, then what the hell is the point?</p>
<p>SIDE NOTE TO THE FANBOYS:<br />
I don&#8217;t remember ANYONE talking about iOS ANYWHERE in this whole damn post. Quit the stupid bickering. You&#8217;re turning this place into Engadget. Don&#8217;t do that. If you&#8217;re commenting on a post regarding the GSIII, One X, and Gnex competing with each other, why the hell would you bring iOS into the argument. Keep that fanboy flamewar shit out of The Verge please. It&#8217;s getting really, really annoying and is almost totally off-topic from the parent post. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>As dissatisfied I am with iOS and iPhones (killing Google Maps, tiny iPhone screen sizes, no NFC, no widgets, poor GMail support, Chrome is crippled on iOS, hideous skeumorphic design slowly polluting the OS&#8230; and many more reasons)&#8230;  I can&#8217;t make the jump to Android because of the very issues discussed above.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus just isn&#8217;t good enough &#8211; ancient GPU, poor screen, bad camera, ugly plasticy Samsung design etc.  But the alternatives are stuck with always out of date versions of the OS and ugly OS skins. Until Google get a solid range of Nexus phones out, I&#8217;ll be stuck in iOS land.</p>
<p>what about a 720p Super Amoled is &#8220;poor&#8221;, exactly?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the same boat. I&#8217;d say the best android phone now is: none. The skinned ones are all crap that won&#8217;t be updated, which I don&#8217;t want to deal with. Or they&#8217;ll gimp JB once it finally comes out. (For example; Samsung has their one &#8220;siri-like&#8221;, will they remove Google Now functions?)</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s annoying that the nexus has a janky screen, that apparently scraches easily. A slow CPU, and worse GPU. Battery life is meh. And the camera is junk. I&#8217;m not spending 350 of my hard earned money on that.</p>
<p>So for now I think the best is to stick with what you have (in my case a crappy dumbphone, ugh) and wait for a hopefully better nexus device in the fall. Although then it will probably be $600 and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll want to spend that on any phone.</p>
<p>Sometimes people want the perfect phone and fail to see that it doesn&#8217;t exist so maybe they should pick from what what does exist. It&#8217;s not like any of the current smartphones are so awful that they aren&#8217;t worth an upgrade from a dumbphone.</p>
<p>Yes, any smartphone would certainly be an upgrade, but it would cost me something like $600 or more just the first year for the phone and dataplan. That&#8217;s a lot of money to spend on something that I really don&#8217;t need for anything. I don&#8217;t need constant email access for work so it&#8217;s just a toy, and I&#8217;m not comfortable spending that much money of frivolous things. Especially when it&#8217;s so flawed. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m waiting; it had better be worth it once I decide to pay for it.</p>
<p>You either like the 720p AMOLED or not, but it&#8217;s not a janky screen to me, IMHO.</p>
<p>If you think 1.2GHZ OMAP5 running stock is slow compared to a 1.5GHZ S4 running skinned android, then you sire have an amazing talent.</p>
<p>GPU clock speed, doesn&#8217;t matter when the OS was designed to work perfectly with it.</p>
<p>A Nexus device is about having the stock OS working well with the hardware it was optimized for.</p>
<p>The camera is disappointing, but it works well in day light, and I do have my DSLR with me during the times I need to take pictures.</p>
<p>Battery life sucks because the 4G radio isn&#8217;t integrated like the new S4 chip.  So most of the first and second year LTE phones from VZW suffer from the same problems.  It&#8217;s not just the GNEX.  But if you are rooted and know your way around the OS, you can make it through the day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to go with Vlad on this.  I wish I didn&#8217;t cause I really like the GS III and the Evo 4G LTE.  But as someone still waiting for Samsung to update the Epic 4G Touch to ICS, I have to say that not have to wait and wonder if you are getting an update gives the Nexus the lead.</p>
<p>Since the Nexus One came out the Nexus have always been the best phones for Android. People always argue that there is another phone coming out with better hardware every month and they are right but it&#8217;s the software updates that make the Nexus the King. There will always be a better spec&#8217;ed Android phone around the corner, that is what Android is about. Those phones need what I call super hardware just to run as smoothly as the Nexus and that is where stock Android comes into play. I know people who always overclock there phones to make them faster but with a Nexus it is always one software update away.</p>
<p>People bitch and I have read the same comments over and over for the last 2 years about how the Nexus suck when they come out and also how 6 months later these same people are praising it for getting new updates while they phone they chose is still sitting 2 or even 3 updates back.</p>
<p>That cold hard fact is that whether people like to admit it or not the Nexus is the best phone period, even better then the iPhone. The iPhone 4 not getting Siri is just plain bullshit because hardware has nothing to do with it and the fact that the Nexus S with early 2010 internal hardware is getting Jellybean just proves it again that <strong>the Nexus is the best. </strong></p>
<p>HTC ONE X IS THE BEST ANDROID PHONE IN JULY 2012</p>
<p>It comes down to the question, does having the latest and greatest hardware trump having the latest and greatest software? Generally speaking, the Galaxy Nexus hardware will survive the 2-year contract time of the phone and remain viable for running all apps and most games in that time.</p>
<p>The reverse isn&#8217;t true though, awesome hardware won&#8217;t likely see Android support for the full 2-years of the contract depending on the state of Android updates. You are lucky if your non-nexus phone is supported 1 year out from release. If it sees an Android update, it is likely at least 6 months upon release of the source, and if it does see that update, it likely won&#8217;t see the next.</p>
<p>I personally choose OS updates, both carrier supported and with developer support, over hardware, assuming the hardware isn&#8217;t awful to start with. Sure the GNex hardware is getting long in the tooth, especially considering the GPU was a bit disappointing to start, but in general the hardware will stand up and the software will continue to be supported when the likes of the others likely will not be.</p>
<p>I take the side of updates and developer support but the reality is more people buy a phone, expect to keep it for 2 years, and expect it not to change too much. Apple perpetuates that with their updates that don&#8217;t  really add but a few new features, and lock some of those features out depending on which device you have. In Android world, it is perpetuated by the carriers/OEMs being slow to update, or not updating at all.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the small but vocal minority that actually get in an uproar about OS updates. A good bit of people who buy these phones just want the latest greatest, thereby making the likes of the SIII and the OneX the &#8220;best.&#8221;</p>
i got the samsung s2 because i read "better stats" in the internet. its software repelled me so ugly it was but i bought it anyway. at the time ice cream sandwich was out but i thought that samsung will sure update so i thought i made a good deal. turns out i had to wait HALF A YEAR after the release of ICS to get .. well, touchwizz. when touchwizz came out, looking as repelling as ever i had enough of this bullshit and switched to nexus. and my goodness, all my apps ran the same there, all my games played flawless, i felt cheated. the phone operated like a charme because it didnt have hardware buttons and you could see and feel that ICS was written for such a device. ICS itself was beautifully fresh and felt complete. i was never happier with a phone and the fact that im running jellybean now before its even out shows me that i did good this time. never, ever a non-nexus phone.
<p>The only thing the Galaxy S3 has over the Galaxy Nexus is a few hardware specs, but do we really need quad core processing in our phones right now? The only reason we would  is to eliminate the lagg from android, and google just did that with jellybean. The S3 is a great phone but much of what it holds over the Nexus is unnecessary and all the new software features like s-voice and smart stay are a gimmick. Does it have a better camera?, yes. Does that really matter?, i really don&#8217;t think so. The average user does not need DSLR quality images from their phone, they just need a descent camera to get snapshots of the small things in life they want to remember, or a quick pic or video of some crazy event happening unexpected before them, and so on&#8230; It is not like the Nexus camera is terrible, it just isn&#8217;t is good as others. The nexus is a unified experience, it is the Android experience as it was meant to be. The Nexus is an amazing phone and still will be at this time next year, so will the S3. They are both amazing phones and i would love to have the Galaxy S3 but i bought the Galaxy Nexus last week bacause i want my phone to be up to date with the greatest software that Google has for their Platform as it is meant to be., and because at $350 for a phone of this quality i could not pass it up. I do have a contract upgrade available in November for AT&amp;T and i will definitely keep the S3 in mind but there may be some new nexus phones available as well. All in all this is an amazing time for tech and i love the fact that there are phones to fill all needs. What i want to start seeing is more Android tablets that will make me want to dump my iPad and go ALL Android, because for ME, Android is a perfect match and i love using it more than iOS. AT the time i bought my iPad there just wasn&#8217;t a case for buying an Android tablet over an iPad. The app market was not yet as good as iOS and every Android tablet just didn&#8217;t seem as good. That has changed, the ecosystems of apps are just about equal and with the introduction of a Nexus tablet and the feeling that Google is fully behind their Play Store i feel that i can soon leave iOS all together, and i am very excited about that.</p>
<p>People care about updates. In 2 years, the galaxy nexus will get key lime pie, and the gs3 will not. If software makes the galaxy nexus the smoothest phone with great battery life, why would the gs3 be better? If you put the galaxy S vs the nexus S today, the nexus s would be better because it has ICS, and soon jelly bean. Also, the price of the galaxy nexus is 350 unlocked. That means your not locked to a carrier  and can go to a prepaid carrier and save 20-30 bucks a month for the same coverage and same speeds.</p>
<p>Android/Google fanboys are becoming a LOT MORE annoying than iOS fanboys&#8230;.</p>
<p>relax, worlds nicer if you cease spewing intollerant remarks, just try and you&#8217;ll see</p>
<p>you talking to me? I don&#8217;t use android. I use windows phone.</p>
<p>*HTC One X owner here, rooted/unlocked bootloader.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, yes, only because of the constant, first hand updates (software). Hardware wise, HELL NO. Phone doesn&#8217;t even come close to what Samsung or HTC has put together for there flagship phones.</p>
<p>Thats why I love root and flash. BAM. My phone has the same software and IS better than your GNexus.</p>
<p>agreed. although the software aspect is not since HTCoX is a legacy device that breaks androids design guidelines. the adaptive quality of a pure touch based interface is a big deal and plays a major role in both ics &amp; jb. see buttons change according to context, see them change position or vanish. this has even been picked up by roms like aokp etc., to the point of redefining the UI: <a href="http://paranoid-rom.com/images/nexus/op-1_nexus.png" target="_blank">http://paranoid-rom.com/images/nexus/op-1_nexus.png</a></p>
<p>hardware buttons cripple that concept, its a thing of the past. and even if some prefer it, ics wasnt made for it and you can feel it wasnt.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s JB running on your unlocked and rooted One X? I just asked Google Now to search for threads with JB roms for Galaxy S III and it came up with none&#8230;</p>

<p>A &#8216;worse&#8217;?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t clarify Sense 4.0 as &#8216;worse&#8217;, its much better than the rest out there but in regards to stock, yes, stock Android is better (duh) and Im just a flash away from it, can you flash hardware?</p>

<p>Right now, the S III and the One X beat the Nexus. The Nexus&#8217;s quick updates don&#8217;t quite make up for the hardware falling behind. But most people, even those who are informed about tech, don&#8217;t buy a new phone every six months. They aren&#8217;t picking between current hardware and current updates, because they keep the same phone for over a year. The best move for most consumers is to wait for a new Nexus device to be released and purchase it then. That way, they have top hardware to start (as they would have if they bought a S III or One X now), but also updates that keep the device fresh until it falls apart.</p>
<p>How do the One x and S3 beat the nexus? More fluid/faster UI? Games work better (not a concern to me), is the screen or battery better? I know the camera is better at least.</p>
<p>I ask because the reviews I&#8217;ve seen say the GNex with JB is the most fluid android ever.</p>
<p>The S III has a bigger screen, bigger battery, better camera, and a bunch of minor upgrades: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/03/galaxy-s-iii-whats-changed/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/03/galaxy-s-iii-whats-changed/</a></p>
<p>The One X has the best screen on any mobile device and has a striking design.</p>
<p>sure, the S III screen is bigger. <strong>Too</strong> big I would say. Wish they would go back to making high end android phones that aren&#8217;t the size of a dorm room TV. I&#8217;d say the Gnex has the advantage there by just being 4.65 instead of 4.8.</p>
<p>The battery is a big one. One of the reasons I dont see myself buying a GNex.</p>
<p>Camera I don&#8217;t really care that much about, but the nexus one is supposedly pretty crap so not very tempting.</p>
<p>Unfortunatley both one X and SIII have terrible skins and will never see an upgrade so they&#8217;re both out of the question.</p>
<p>Guess any phone upgrade is on hold till we see new Nexuses/nexi around the end of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;and the one in which Samsung&#8217;s software update track record is patchier than Greece&#8217;s finances.&#8221; &#8211; <strong>OH SICK BUUUUURN</strong> ahem. I still think you should do these editorial features over a bassline and have it as a rap battle between Chris Ziegler and Vlad Savov.</p>
<p>What this is really about: Hardware vs. software.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t argue for a second that the Galaxy Nexus is &#8220;old&#8221; in terms of hardware by now. It has been comprehensively bettered. But, I&#8217;m not convinced that really matters. Most phones these days are more or less the same in terms of hardware. Every generation of flagship phones brings with it the latest and greatest processors, more RAM, bigger/higher resolution screens, and the next generation is generally just an iteration on what already exists. There are few hardware features on phones that truly add a dramatic increase in functionality. Software, on the other hand, completely changes the experience. Software is what you actually use. Sure, better hardware will run it better. But, in the case of the non-Nexus Android flagships, they simply don&#8217;t have access to the superior software the Nexus has. It&#8217;s like sticking a great engine in a shit car. Sure, it&#8217;ll be powerful, but it ultimately doesn&#8217;t matter because the rest of the experience is inferior.</p>
<p>Of course, if you actually prefer Touchwiz or Sense, this argument is moot. Use it if you like it. But, the general consensus seems to be that Google&#8217;s un-diluted Android is the way to go. It&#8217;s a consensus I do agree with. Were I to buy an Android phone, I&#8217;d feel much more secure about purchasing a Galaxy Nexus than anything else. It&#8217;s longevity and on-going support are HUGE assets that HTC and Samsung have yet to really offer on their own flagships. Their track records suck.</p>
<p>Yep I got my friends 2010 Samsung Vibrant running 4.0 this week and it runs very smooth.</p>
<p>For the money, yes, considering you are getting an unlocked penta-band HSDPA phone that is free from carrier control. The next recent penta-band HSDPA phone is the Nokia 41MP camera phone, for $700. So yeah, $350 for the Galaxy Nexus is a steal.</p>
<p>Not sure why the presence of LTE is thrown as a big plus, Id rather have unlimited (yes truly unlimited 3,5G/HSPA+) than data caped LTE, which having it is like giving you a Ferrari California with only 2 gallons of fuel per month, that will suck on my battery almost twice as fast.</p>
<p>Hell to the yes!</p>
<p>I find it hilarious that the comments on an article about what is the best Android phone have such a large number of Android versus iOS posts.</p>
<p>I, for one, agree with Vlad. While the hardware of the GSIII is truly awesome, the fact that there&#8217;s no set plan as to when it will get 4.1 (read: Google Now) ruins it for me. Remember, it&#8217;s not about the specs, it&#8217;s about the UX.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the internet. A post here discussing how to cook a turkey would end up in an android vs iOS war</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same old story with non-nexus phones, the only difference is that it&#8217;s a different year.</p>
<p>I think if I would get an Android phone, I would still go for the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>I need the new Nexus Phones to come out soon, I want stock android but on the BEST hardware so I don&#8217;t have to buy a new phone every year.</p>
<p>Chris’s main point is all about hardware but all that hardware doesn’t make those phones faster, smoother or make games look any better then with the current Nexus.</p>
<p>That hardware could be on any phone like a Windows Phone or an iPhone so the hardware isn’t the key it’s Android and the best version of Android is on the Nexus so that makes the Nexus the #1 Android phone.</p>
<p>The old Nexus S and Vibrant that both have the same early 2010 1GHz single core Hummingbird processor are running 4.0 and will have no problem running 4.1.</p>
<p>Team Chris FTFW!!!</p>
<p>There are always people that think like Chris but then they come back to reality sooner or later. I have been seeing this ever since the Nexus One came out. I was like them before when I had the Google Ion but then the Nexus proved to me over and over in 201o that Google had the right idea. Even and 2012 I still think that after everything I have seen the Nexus always end up on top.</p>
<p>Just look at how a 2010 phone running stock can compete against phones like the GS3 and HTC One. Let&#8217;s see a old 2010 Samsung or HTC phone running their last skins compare to the new phones today.</p>
<blockquote>Just ask owners of the Galaxy S how they feel about the identically-specced Nexus S enjoying an Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade while their phones continue snacking on stale Gingerbread software.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Boom headshot!</strong></p>
<p>Chris&#8217;s main point is all about hardware but all that hardware doesn&#8217;t make those phones faster, smoother or make games look any better then with the current Nexus.</p>
<p>That hardware could be on any phone like a Windows Phone or an iPhone so the hardware isn&#8217;t the key it&#8217;s Android and the best version of Android is on the Nexus so that makes the Nexus the #1 Android phone.</p>
<p>Chris says &#8216;We aren&#8217;t arguing value here&#8230;&quot; &#8211; well, that&#8217;s all well and good for an enlightened tech journalist with a new batch of high end phones in his hand every week, but back in the real world a $350 price tag is a huge concern.</p>
<p>A regular guy needs future-proofing as part of the investment.  The ability to upgrade the software NOW provides that.</p>
<p>future proofing also has to do with hardware :D</p>
<p>Nailed it.</p>
<p>Since we all need to move toward buying devices direct from manufacturers at a higher price point, longevity will be a key issue. You won&#8217;t want a phone that doesn&#8217;t receive software updates for a year and a half until you are ready to purchase a new one. That said, you also don&#8217;t want a phone with outdated hardware specs for a year and a half. Tough call.</p>
<blockquote> Top-tier OEMs like Samsung, HTC, and LG</blockquote>
<p>Quick, name 5 phones made by LG.</p>

<p>Riiight .. but how many of last year&#8217;s devices are <strong>actually</strong> running ICS?</p>
<p>Verizon weighs in: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/9/3147043/verizon-confirms-locked-bootloader-samsung-galaxy-s-iii">&#8220;The Galaxy Nexus <b>is</b> still the best Android phone &#8230;at least on our network.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on Verizon, even your selection of third-party roms will be limited to those willing to deliver work-arounds to the locked bootloader.</p>
<p>Verizon&#8217;s GNex will have 4.1 by the end of this month, and you&#8217;ll have the option of painlessly switching your unlocked bootloader over to the rom of your choice.</p>
<p>Simple&#8230;screw Verizon and own a Global GSM device. Switch phones, GSM or put your SIM on any imported awesome phone which will never release on the useless CDMA verizon network.</p>
<p>It is to me. I love mine.</p>
<p>(Back to the article)<br />
As a person who is still waiting on an ICS upgrade for the tablet that I got last year and who won&#8217;t see an updgrade to her phone, I have to go with the GNex as the better option than <strong>any</strong> phone from a carrier/manufacturer other than Google.</p>
<p>And with that I&#8217;ll state that I waited for hardware announcements at  i/o, but will continue to wait to buy a new phone <em>and</em> tablet until the Xmas buying season rolls around.  The GNex HAS to be ready for at least a minor hardware refresh and if Google didn&#8217;t partner with anybody for a larger tablet then they are crazy.</p>
<p> I&#8217;m planning to buy a Gnex from Google, and wondering if I could go to any store that sells ATT phones to get it activated[like at Best Buy], or I must go to a specific ATT only store to get this done. They just basically install a sim card right?</p>
<p>If you already have service (AT&amp;T or T-mobile), all you need to do is insert the sim card into the back of the phone.  The Gnex is unlocked and you can use it on any GSM carrier.  For $350 unlocked and jelly bean, it is a total steal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently on Verizon, but my contracts is up so I&#8217;m free to go anywhere. However I live in a rural area and besides Verizon only ATT&#8217;s coverage is any good. Now I assume it will be ATT who provide the sim card not Google right?</p>
<p>Consider a non-contract plan/provider such as Straight Talk (choice of ATT or TMobile sim $45 per month) or one of T-Mobile&#8217;s monthly 4G plans.</p>
<p>I thought the best phone is iPhone 4s? &#8230;.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>erudite and learned pretty much mean the same thing, there&#8217;s no need to use both in the same sentence. You can say, for example &#8220;Joshua is an erudite scholar&#8221;</p>
<p>These days, you can have a cutting edge OS or cutting edge hardware, but not both.  HTC and Samsung are getting closer to the former one, but they are not there yet.  If you want the best OS that gets updates for about 2 years&#8230;get a Nexus phone.  Otherwise, buy your phone based on what it has now&#8230;.not a future update&#8230;.or get an iPhone, where even the 2009 model will get iOS 6 (albeit with less features).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just going to say this. Google employees themselves uses Galaxy Nexus to develop Android, they aren&#8217;t stupid to put on a &#8220;outdated hardware&#8221; for own use. They know what hardware is, that it is merely a vehicle to deliver the content (read: software) to the user. Ultimately the content is what matters.</p>
<p>The should be a hot-key for &#8220;Jump to next recommended comment&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent talk gentlemen!</p>
<p>Good article. Sorry I shamefully contributed to the iOS vs Android batter, but glad to see such an article exist. Galaxy Nexus with Jelly Bean and Key Lime Pie for the win!</p>
<p>*battle</p>
<p>Chris didn&#8217;t offer any compelling argument. The Nexus has an inferior screen, camera and processor, but it costs less than half while offering a much better software experience. Touchwiz Nature UX may be acceptable, but it is still inferior, from the dialer and contacts app to the Messaging application and the butter which will come to the nexus soon enough.</p>
<p>It lags behind in updates, and by next month will be outdated software wise, and that&#8217;s way more important, I wouldn&#8217;t call the iPhone inferior because its screen isn&#8217;t 720p or its camera is slow, or because it runs a dual core processor, same with the Nexus.</p>
<p>I could kiss you right now.</p>
<p>have fun beta-testing then&#8230; by the time the htc one x and the galaxy s3 will have jelly bean it might actually be worth it, but right now, have fun with a big screen being eaten up by an ugly on-screen menu-bar in most apps and rendering your device not one bid better than a phone with a smaller screen and physical menu key.</p>
<p>being on the latest version of android always means being the better tester which can be attested by anyone running the quirky flawed versions of ICS prior 4.0.3/4 so i would rather use a galaxy s2 which gets updated to a fixed ICS version than jump ship first and have my apps misbehave.</p>
<p>in the end the experience counts and not whose fault it is that there is an on screen menu button and stuff.</p>
<blockquote>by the time the htc one x and the galaxy s3 will have jelly bean it might actually be worth it</blockquote>
<p>How did you come to that conclusion?<br />
I&#8217;m seriously interested, not trying to start a fight here.</p>
<p>i come to that conclusion by having eagerly followed ICS since it start and reading of app incompatibility issues, messaging bugs inside the early ICS releases (prior 4.0.3) so if you would have been one of the google nexus customers that did use the phone with the first ICS releases you would possibly end up with a phone lacking key features (for instance not being able to reliably send and receive sms messages). it took a good while until all things where fixed, so instead of jumping to JB already and experiencing all bugs, i would gladly wait for Android 4.1.2 or something which is actually a stable version without the kinks that are always part of a new release.</p>
<p>The apps where not even ready for ICS a few month ago, so it might look like this with JB for quite some time.</p>
<p>People that used ICS 4.0.3 with SMS apps like GO SMS would constantly send or receive two sms instead of one. this is fixed now but just illustrates that you can have the best OS in the world, it will not lead to a good user experience if the apps are way behind (and they are judging by the on-screen-menu-bar fiasco) and your OS has still major bugs.</p>
<p>just read the notes for the varios ICS releases and see how many bugs have been fixed until 4.0.4</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#Android_4" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#Android_4</a>.0.x_Ice_Cream_Sandwich</p>
<p>I agree there were some bugs, but you&#8217;ve got to consider that the jump from GB to ICS was really big, JellyBean&#8217;s changes are very minor compared to that and less likely to bring incompatibility issues and bugs.<br />
<blockquote>on-screen-menu-bar fiasco</blockquote><br />
I think that&#8217;s just an issue with the One X.</p>
<p>Guys, I&#8217;m actually holding in one hand the HTC One X and in the other the GNex. PLEASE help me decide which one to let go.<br />
Sincerely, gadget lover.</p>
<p>If I were you, I would choose galaxy nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>gnex. software is what you&#8217;re dealing with, hardware delivers and that is all.</p>
<p>My first thought when I read that &#8220;buying into the nexus program guarentees&#8221;: NO. NO. Verizon GN. The sensation got 4.0.3 before Galaxy Nexus. And then the bugs and signals, and lag. Nah. One X is the top dog, and GSIII is nearly there.</p>
<p>cdma is a bit of a downer, carriers had to be greedy again by making it proprietary, bloating the poor thing with silly apps, cutting out other parts they didnt like. oems have way too much power. its a nexus though, unlock it and install your own os &#8211; its done in seconds. still i&#8217;d go for the gsm version over a s3/onex any day because those will never officially get anything but touchcrap and WILL cause long waiting times for devs to port true JB. youre stuck with a super-duper hardware that wont make apps and games better than on a nexus, yet your software, the things youre actually dealing with, sucks bollocks.</p>
<p>YES.  YES.  Verizon often gets updates at the back of the GNexus pack, but that back of that pack is still months and months ahead of TouchWiz and Sense.  I suspect my GNexus will be slower to get Jelly Bean than an unlocked GSM model; it might be August instead of July for me.  The One X and GS3 might get JB in early 2013.</p>
<p>going to buy it tomorrow after selling my blackberry bold&#8230; promise :)</p>
<p>The fact that there exists a debate says something about the Galaxy Nexus i.e. that over half a year later it&#8217;s still relevant (which is rare in the world of Android). Although Chris does have a good point; we can&#8217;t keep ignoring innovations in hardware just because the software is a decimal point behind.</p>
<p>these innovations are minimal at best. it feels more like holding us back, feeding us miniscule figures, one megapixel here, one millimeter more estate there, 0.0000001 ghz faster, etc. in the end you gotta ask yourself, does it REALLY result in a better experience? not necessary . software on the other hand is being developped actively and is improving each day. what big difference it makes you will know after you swap ics for jb on a nexus. bam, thrice as fast, fluid like butter. the truth is, nexus runs all apps that you throw at it and doesnt go into its knees playing the newest games aswell &#8211; now add to that being on the bleeding edge of os development, receiving your updates timely, owning a phone that you know will receice key lime pie, having a great dev-community with many original roms, well, &#8230; and then theres the price. its a no brainer. get the s3 and you get the opposite of all points mentioned except great hardware &#8211; not that it matters.</p>
<p>if i had more then 400 bucks to my name id get the Gnexus&#8230;. LOL</p>
<p>Yes. It still.<br />
I&#8217;ve played with a One X and S3 and they were nice and fast and smooth.<br />
Then, I got Jelly Bean on my Nexus. Sure the One X and S3 will probably be amazing with JB, the question is will they even get it in a timely manner?</p>
<p>they will never get it. not in a timely matter anyway. they will fetch androids newest kernel and androids unix/java 4.1 underbelly, stuff their own hellish OS on top and call it &#8220;jellybean&#8221; which is below the belt if you ask me. imagine someone goes into an art-museum buys your painting, smears a crappy picture on it with watercolors and sells it under your name.</p>
<p>your only chance is cyanogenmod-10.</p>
<p>CyanogenMod needs their it&#8217;s act together. JB is about to be released and CM9 hasn&#8217;t even been released yet.</p>
<p>Look at AOKP on the other side. It <strong>might</strong> not be as devoid of issues as a final release of CM9, but would users even care about a final CM9 when JB&#8217;s already out there?</p>
<p>aokp is based on cm9. they dont develop much, they mostly &#8220;kang.&#8221; it took a little bit this time because they developed features that can even be described professional, they are top notch. jb will probably be merged quickly, dont worry.</p>
<p>dammit. aokp kangs. cyanogenmod took awhile. sorry for the confusion.</p>
<p>CM9RC1 came out. I think that&#8217;s pretty good for now.<br />
Plus, as they&#8217;ve said, it will be easier making CM10 than CM9 because there&#8217;s less of a jump from ICS to JB than GB to ICS.</p>
<p>Plus, CM have said CM9 is pretty much done. <br />
Once they get CM10 out it will be CM7 and CM10, that&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re pretty much gonna get .1 releases for CM9 until then.</p>
<p>AOKP doesn&#8217;t do as much as CM. As their name suggests. they &#8220;kang&#8221; <br />
CM has been more stable for me than ANY AOKP release. Starting since the first few nightlies, CM has been more stable than even any Milestone AOKP.<br />
The CM team absolutely knows what they are doing. I hardly use any other ROM.</p>
<p>I have literally NEVER had an issue with AOKP.  My phone has not frozen a SINGLE time.  It doesn&#8217;t get more stable than that&#8230;.</p>
<p>I own an HTC One X and use it with AOKP. Although Sense 4 is nice, I&#8217;d never use it over stock Android. Same thing applies to GSIII, in it&#8217;s current form, at least.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for the JellyBean source code to be released so that I can run it on my lovely phone.</p>
<p>anyone else think this article is just a long form of most verge comment threads?</p>
<p>One thing to consider here is that whether or not the user is tech savvy or not. If he/she is, then the HOX and GSIII are obviously the better choice since they can always flash it a custom ROM to get the stock Android UX.</p>
<p>BUT, if they&#8217;re not, then do the improvements offered by JB put it ahead of the experience offered by a Sensed/Natured HOX/GSIII.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that they do.</p>
<p>good point. its weird really, people buy computers and install the new windows/osx version just fine, even by hand. but the minute their computer is small and fits their pocket they just wont, even if its ten times as trivial as their laptop update. in the mainstream media you see this ugly word flying around &#8220;fragmentation&#8221; and generally its one of those things to throw into to make a big fuss against google- but ics is pretty much ready to install on most devices out there, and jb will be soon. my little sister runs  ics on her tiny itsy bitsy age old htc wildfire which otherwise would be stuck at who knows what android version. but well &#8230; &#8220;rooting is pathetic, updates should come over the air&#8221; thats the consent, sadly.</p>
<p>This was an awesome debate</p>
<p>Along with my Nexus GSM I have the HTC One X and after a couple of months, I am going back to the Nexus. The HTC is a great phone but the hiccups do add up because of the frequency of use. I&#8217;m not saying that the Nexus is perfect or without flaws. But whatever flaws or imperfections it has in ICS, most likely so will the other super phones. I believe that there are added flaws when you have that extra layer of UI on top of stock. Just because there is that extra layer of UI, it does not mean it fixes all the inherent problems of the stock UI.  Given that the hardware on the Nexus is a little lower, it still is a very stable and reliable build out of all the Custom ROMs out there (HTC Sense, TouchWiz, Motoblur). The One X and the S3 are the best looking phones in my opinion but for me, looks does not get stuff done.﻿</p>
<p>Go Vlad! Nexus FTW!</p>
<p>Having a Galaxy Note which is probably getting JB never or in 8 months, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate how important it is to buy a Nexus device.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just terrible to know a &#8220;new&#8221; phone will be stuck in old versions of the OS&#8230;</p>
<p>Neither the One X nor the Galaxy S3 come out of the box with Jellybean.</p>
<p>hopefully, ASUS would be making one of the new rumor nexus phones&#8230; at least there good with their updates. so we get both high-end hardware and software.</p>
<p>I like the Nexus for several reason but mostly because it gets the latest updates before anyone else does. As far as bells and whistles I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any better then the SIII or HTC 1/Evo line. I like vanilla Android but I also like Sense, because it&#8217;s different and it works (for the most part).</p>
<p>Like Chris and Vlad said until the OEMs get their collective acts together and start updating their products on a timely basis Google will keep touting the Nexus as the only pure Android experience.</p>
<p> It&#8217;s really a shame Samsung or HTC really don&#8217;t feel like it&#8217;s  priority to update their phones on a timely basis. But then again do people who aren&#8217;t into technology care?</p>
<p><strong>just slowly and quietly walks away from this one&#8230;</strong> :)</p>
<p>I am going to have to agree with Vlad.  I love my Galaxy Nexus, and have no interest in moving to an S3.  My brother bought one on Sprint the day it came out.  It does have good battery life, but besides that it&#8217;s pretty ugly and doesn&#8217;t feel as fast as my JB Nexus.  The only complaint I have with my GN is that the glass isn&#8217;t Gorilla and scratches noticeably easier than the Droid 1 it replaced.</p>
<p>If more people continue to buy the Galaxy Nexus it sends a signal that we WANT the most recent vanilla Android and hopefully more phones would be made with that in mind.  Sorry Chris, but touchwiz still sucks, and even though the specs on the S3 might be a little better, the design is terrible.  We shouldn&#8217;t support releases that look like crap.</p>
<p>sidenote:: I t would be great if a post having nothing to do with iOS/Apple could get relevant comments and not devolve into a fanwar in the first 10 posts.  I wish the mods would delete people who start and fan the flames of those pointless debates over which OS is better, particularly when the post doesn&#8217;t even discuss anything but Android.</p>
<p>Chris is correct. Vlad lets his emotions get in the way of his opinion too much.</p>
<p>What did Dieter say?</p>
<p>If you go Android it&#8217;s gonna be one of the big three: HTC One X, Galaxy SIII or Galaxy Note. The Galaxy Nexus is not worth consideration in my opinion. The on-screen buttons are so incredibly tacky, I&#8217;m not sure I could ever get over them. It would be nice to get the latest Android version first though.</p>
<p>note &#8230; does it even have cm yet? last time i read about it users hard bricked theirs because of broken samsung kernels. i mean what is a device worth if you have no support whatsoever, being chained to an operating system made by samsung, the worst software company on this planet.</p>
<p>software buttons are the way to go, ics &amp; jb were written in that way. use a nexus once, especially running jb and you will understand why google is right making them officially obsolete.</p>
<p>I think it has CM9 nightlies. I run the German LPY ICS official ROM. Yeah, I&#8217;ve heard a lot of horror stories about users bricking their Samsung phones. Hasn&#8217;t happened to me, but it sure sounds scary.</p>
<p>vlad won&#8230; and i do not like vlad (at least on the mobile show)</p>
<p>So a buddy of mine just recently purchased the GSIII. On a roadtrip this 4th we had a chance to compare the two phones. We both have reasons to be jealous.</p>
<p>My G-Nexus is without a doubt lacking in the camera department and in some ways I really do miss physical nav keys. Not being able to easily modify the DPI of the virtual navigation keys in Jelly Bean is really irking me.</p>
<p>On his end he gets to feel the pain of not running Jelly Bean, which really does at present make the two phones feel almost identical in terms of speed and performance, at least where real world experience is concerned.  Neither of us could find a situation where either of the two phones had any real perceivable advantage on that front. <br />
We also both agree that the Nature UX while much nicer than previous Touchwiz offerings, still has a bit of gaudiness to it. WTH is with that neon green hardware shortcut menu in the notification window? It sticks out like a sore thumb. <br />
We both have been Android users since day one, and have both enjoyed the fruits of the community at XDA and other locations. He is now plainly aware that his device is going to move slower while gaining traction in the custom rom scene and that every update by Google, that Samsung stalls for drivers on, is going to exacerbate this issue.</p>
<p>I really think this argument, which was great btw, can be answered pretty simply.</p>
<p>Is the Galaxy Nexus still the best Android has to offer?<br />
1. If you like to tinker and have a crack like addiction to flashing roms,  or if you always want the newest of the new straight from Mountain View, then YES it is still the best.</p>
<p>2. If you just want a bad ass phone, to use and dont care anything about bootloaders or understand why people are talking about vegetable roots when discussing their phones, then NO there are better phones than the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Forget the Verizon version, SGS3 is one of the easiest phone to unlock bootloader and root. Heck you don&#8217;t even have to unlock the bootloader, just flash the custom rom thru ODIN and you are gold. <br />
I agree on your reasoning but I have to disagree that GNex is easy to flash roms than SGS3. Both have great developer support and CM. Once CM merges JellyBean on to their sources then SGS3 will be flying. My main gripe with the Galaxy Nexus is camera otherwise everything else is fine.</p>
<p>You misunderstood my point&#8230; <br />
I was not saying the GS3 is hard to root, any modern Samsung outside of a Verizon model is easy as hell on that front, because of ODIN. <br />
I was talking about custom roms not moving as fast on the GS3 in terms of development. The Nexus line will always be one step ahead. Not by that much really, but when its comes to he and I, its more of a &#8220;first&#8221; kind of thing. <br />
Childish? Yes! <br />
Fun to tease your friend? Yes!</p>
<p>Great article.</p>
<p>I love my Galaxy Nexus.. x</p>
<p>Best is obviously subjective, but when you consider that the GS3 will outsell the GN in a huge way, I think the GS3 has a solid claim.  Making geeks happy is one thing; making big profits is another.</p>
<p>I would also have a hard time recommending the GN as a purchase for anyone right now.  If the past is an indicator of the future with google,  a new nexus phone will show up in months.  At that time either the new Nexus will be geek-approved-crack, or the GN will be even cheaper to find.  Win-win.</p>
<p>Finally, I love how a question about best android phone brings up so much apple discussion.  I wouldn&#8217;t say that makes android look better.  I it just makes some look insecure in their consumer choice.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus is Android&#8217;s iPhone. It doesn&#8217;t run the most cutting edge specs, but it runs the most up to date version of Android and has the most refined and consistent experience.</p>
<p>the best android phone is iphone!!! yeah!!!! ;)</p>
<p>I have no idea where I stand on this. My brother wants to get a Galaxy Nexus, moving from a Windows Phone (he loves Windows Phone but feels he misses out on a lot of apps). As much as I would like to say &#8220;yes, go get it now!&#8221; it&#8217;s not a smart decision. It&#8217;s about 8 months into it&#8217;s life. There&#8217;s a new Nexus around the corner. Then the issue is if there will be a Verizon/Sprint exclusivity when it comes out and when a GSM model will be available in the US after it launches.<br />
Going the other route, there&#8217;s so far no timeline of when, say the HTC One X or Galaxy S III will get Jelly Bean, or any other phone for that matter. Then, what about a year from now? Will they get whatever comes after Jelly Bean? I think of my own situation. I got a HTC Sensation soon after it came out. This was one of HTC&#8217;s best phones last year. I got ICS through HTC and my carrier in June. I was up-to-date for one month before the next version of the OS came out (and a good six months since ICS was available on the Nexus). Will I get it? Probably not, but I&#8217;ve barely had the phone one year and it is already obsolete.</p>
<p>theres always something around the corner. nexus is a great phone that can easily deal with todays and tomorrows content yet you will be on the newest, freshest software and it will easily get the next android iteration. software is what youre dealing with, hardware simply delivers and nexus does deliver.</p>
<p>s3, onex, etc. will not get jellybean. jellybean is the name of the os that was crafted on top of android 4.1 by google, duarte and team. samsung and htc build their own ghastly ooerating systems, basing on 4.1 unix+java-framework, then call it &#8220;jellybean.&#8221; not only will you wait ages for these &#8220;jellybeans,&#8221; you wont be satisfied. dont even assume they will see key lime pie, it will be the same old story.</p>
<p>Yeah that&#8217;s true. I mean we should be used to the broken promises by now. I don&#8217;t want to be complacent as far as updated software goes, and in that sense getting the Nexus is the best &#8220;f you&#8221; to the status quo.</p>
<p>I can almost guarantee there will be a GSM version of the next Nexus. GSM is the only technology that allows Google to make a true and pure Nexus were there&#8217;s no bloat and no delays waiting for carrier approval. I&#8217;d be willing to bet we&#8217;ll see a GSM variant shortly after release (if it isn&#8217;t the flagship device) that stands a good chance of being LTE capable that will be sold through Google Play like the current one.</p>
<p>But if your brother is impatient, tell him to get the Nexus. It may be dated, but it still stands the best chance of any phone out there seeing the next Android update after Jelly Bean. The Galaxy SIII is also a pretty safe bet though too because they gave the US versions 2 GB of RAM specifically so it would be more future-proof regarding updates. Back to the Nexus, while it&#8217;s hardware pales in comparison to current superphones, keep in mind it&#8217;s got Project Butter, so it probably feels more fluid in everyday use.</p>
<p>My advice, if he can&#8217;t wait, get the Nexus through Google Play. It&#8217;s $350 with no contract and no obligations. But, if he can be patient it&#8217;s probably worth waiting. It may be Christmas time before the next Nexus (Nexi?) launches, but a GSM model is almost guaranteed. Plus, judging by how many phones are shipping with Qualcomm S4&#8217;s right now, I&#8217;d say no matter which manufacturer landed Nexus duties this next time around, there&#8217;s a good chance we&#8217;ll see an S4 under the hood. Who doesn&#8217;t want S4 power and Nexus goodness? I know it&#8217;s got me salivating.</p>
<p>i really like my galaxy nexus since the jelly bean update, because who would not prefer a shoddy 5mp cam with quick but mediocre at best photos to the cameras built into the htc one x or the samsung galaxy s3 ?</p>
<p>on top of that i like jelly bean for its buttery smoothness and automatically ramping up the cpu speed to the max, when i touch the screen. that does make my already mediocre battery life, worsen. a few month ago you would check with cpuspy how much time your cpu is spending on the different clock speeds and you would try to get rid of apps that spin up the clock speed up top without doing really hard work (like 3d gaming and so on) but now i do not need to worry anymore, because the OS will ramp up the clockspeed anyways for an even more trivial thing like being a bit more buttery in transitions and animations. ok, i will probably have an hour  less screen on time per battery charge due to buttery smooth needlessly ramping up the cpu speed, but at least the low usage time i get out of one charge was very smooth. i am sure my boss will understand that it is more important that i had fun writing 20 e-mails in buttery smooth fashion until not being available on the phone anymore, than actually being able to be productive for longer periods of time with less fancy transitions.</p>
<p>i really enjoy reading web pages on my 720p screen, because  it fits more text of the web page onto the screen at once. i happily press the &#8220;lock&#8221; button to light up the screen again, because i took to long to read the whole page before the screen timeout kicked in. who needs smart stay ? i gladly press the button all the time.. it&#8217;s more fluid and buttery and stuff</p>
<p>/sarcasm</p>
<p>lemme see. 1 day, 12 hours. screen on over 3 hours, heavy browsing, gaming, calling. wifi on all the time, gps when needed. running in multitasking nonstop: facebook, skype, whatsapp, gtalk, 7 emails accounts, and a couple of others. brightness set to 50%. HORRIBLE battery life, really. damn you jellybean. /sarcasm</p>
<p>that&#8217;s the standard statement used by galaxy nexus users with good battery life:</p>
<p>hey i get great battery life, i just need to dim the screen (thats mediocre by todays top smartphone standards already) so much, that it&#8217;s just a bit above the threshold where ugly banding effects show up.</p>
<p>if you think your phone was designed to run in 50% brightness all the time, it is your thing, but than i could argue  that my toyota supra is really economic and only needs 8 liters of gas for 100 km when i drive the the rpm wont exceed 3&#8217;000 rpm.</p>
<p>of course it is always depending on what you have experienced by yourself. if you see users with the galaxy s3 achieving over 7 hours of screen on time you would probably think twice about how good your battery life is ;)</p>
<p>&#8220;dim the phone,&#8221; youre funny arent you, 100% you have any idea just how scorching bright that is? it would actually hurt to read a book or browse theverge. (-;</p>
<p>i think it&#8217;s a matter of preference, but seeing that the galaxy nexus was notorious for its low brightness compared to the other screens of that time and after, i would not have known anyone who would describe 100% brightness on that phone as &#8220;hurting the eyes&#8221; or scorching bright.</p>
<p>i assume your eyes did already adjust to the relatively low brightness setting you use day in and day out so it might appear to you just as you conveyed, but still it&#8217;s hard to argue with someone who did not see the other side.</p>
<p>by that i mean i could not convince a porsche driver that the new ferrari is the better car, if the porsche driver never even sat in a ferrari and always watches everything out of his perspective without getting to know &#8220;what&#8217;s out there&#8221;.</p>
<p>you see the comments of some users how jelly bean on the GN does feel as fluid as the touchwiz ux on the galaxy s3, while this may be a great achievement you might ask &#8220;if it is as quick and fluid, why go with the phone that has worse camera, screen and processor if both are equal in speed and the new one can only become even greater with a JB update&#8221;.</p>
<p>the story that vlad tells about samsungs bad  update track record is old already and not giving enough credit for the current updates the galaxy s2 and s3 users receive.</p>
<p>galaxy s3 just received an update that did remedy the small kinks vlad did criticize (i.e. brightness switch in notification menu) and this is nearly 2 month after launch. if this is not a quick update i don&#8217;t know what it.</p>
<p>and that one about your 7 hours. you did read the one and a half day remark, did you. thats normal usage, being able to use a phone rather heavy a day and then some. if i&#8217;d take it and breed 6-7 hours in row over it well that probably could be possible but i havent tried nor would i because thats more than silly.</p>
<p>Reading your comment, I can only say you&#8217;re so sold by all the gimmicks Samsung has advertised.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes it is. To put it in the simplest terms: By the time Samsung and HTC roll out their premier Nexus-beating phones (in this case, the One X and the SGS3), the Nexus will be getting a software update making it better and faster than both phones. I personally think the best smartphone plan is to stick to the Nexus for two years (starting with the GNex or the Nexus One &#8212;those in between are meh updates), So for me, my next phone will be the one arriving with KeyLime Pie.</p>
<p>As long as the big 4 wireless companies continue to ripoff their smartphone customers with overpriced, slow, spotty, capped, throttled and otherwise lousy required mobil data plans I will continue to veto getting one: I don&#8217;t care how cool they are. An iPod Touch, Nexus N7 or Macbook on wifi is perfectly fine when combined with a dumbphone. This is my free market once finger salute to the unethical business practices that the wireless carriers hamper innovation with while also screwing their customers&#8230;..</p>
<p>Referencing Nilay Patels article on this topic:</p>
<p>Companies like Google, Samsung, Apple, HTC, Sony, LG: the companies that make the devices we want are held back by outrageous rules from the wireless carriers. In the end these unethical business practice come down to the following ethical violations:</p>
<p>1. The wireless spectrum belongs to the public. <br />
2. Requiring a data plan is unethical if the customers is willing to pay the full retail price of the phone. <br />
3. Price fixing between carriers make the data costs similar no matter which service provider you go with. <br />
4. A lack of real competition keeps the price of mobil data artificially high while service quality is affected by poor network coverage and slow access speeds. <br />
5. While 4G is better than 3G, both technologies are inefficient in terms of power consumption, causing range anxiety with smartphone users: this does not have to be the case: smaller towers located closer together reduce the phones tranmissions power requirements and give end users longer battery life. <br />
6. The lack of HD voice quality services is inexplicable, and evidence of technological lagging and innovation surpression on behalf of the big 4. <br />
7. Our elected officials in the FCC, Congress and Senate are pandering to the special interests (the big 4 and others) that bribe them : this is not a democracy : lobby = briber = oligarchy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the software, in the end. Hardware supports the software. I woud prefer to get the latest updates and the &#8220;google approved&#8221; version of android. Imagine if every windows oem made their own UI. Even if the skins were good, it would be a headache for interoperability and seamless transitions from one manufacturer to another.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll stay with my nexus. The hardware is more than adequate. My only request would be a better camera, but I rarely use my smartphone as a substitute for my dslr or even my point and shoot when the pictures matter. Even when I had my iphone 4s, I didn&#8217;t use it to substitute for standalone cameras. Can&#8217;t wait to see what happens to the nexus line this fall. I plan on sticking to my gnex for the next two years, but it will be great to see the nexus market expand.</p>
<p>My first day so far with Android, on a brand-new-from-Best-Buy GS3 has been decidedly mixed so far.</p>
<p>Coming from a Symbian Nokia E72, I love the functionality and the apps.   The occasional stutters, and the multiple browsers crashes (all within hours of purchase), not so much.</p>
<p>Also, this thing gets really hot, and I was only web browsing on it, over Wifi at that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m within my return window, so thinking of possibly taking it back for an iPhone or one of the Windows phones.</p>
<p>As much as I am loving what Microsoft has done with Windows Phone, I would stay away from that OS for the next couple of months.</p>
<p>They already said that non of the existing WP7  phones will be upgraded to Windows Phone 8 (a necessity in order to move their platform forward) and Windows Phone 8 should be coming out in October.</p>
<p>I would be pissed if I spent money on a WP phone only to find out that all new apps that will get developed from October on, will not run on my device.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know about the situation with Windows Phone, and it isn&#8217;t great.</p>
<p>The only way I&#8217;d consider it, is to buy a Lumia cheap, unlocked, and save my upgrade and revert to my old plan.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll give the SGS3 a few more days, and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Having said that I&#8217;m really excited about Windows Phone 8</p>
<p>well i kinda understand you. when i bought my first android handset it was the s2 running touchwizz gingerbread and it was TERRIBLE. it looked like hell, things splattered everywhere. luckily i got so pissed at it that i rooted and installed ICS, that finally made me see where true android is at. i knew samsung is one of the worst software companies but i wasn&#8217;t quite prepared i must say. i bought nexus and its everything that the s series is not, the user experience is so dramatically different its worlds appart, jellybean even made the gap larger. if you can live with the ugly shell i&#8217;d suggest you go the cyanogenmod route and try ICS. cm10 will come out eventually and you will get jellybean.</p>
<p>Also, what&#8217;s up with the Facebook app for Android.   I&#8217;ve used a similar one on my gf&#8217;s iPhone, and that one is so much smoother and has more functionality.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t seem to save photos and images on the Android FB app.  Anybody?</p>
<p>its crap, even one of the most crappy apps on android. try faster facebook, i heard its good.</p>
<p>if Gnexus is running ice cream sandwich, i will choose sgs3 without any doubt</p>
<p>now that gnexus is running jelly bean, i will choose it over sgs3</p>
<p>the thing is that now, when android superphones are using quad core in order for the OS to run smoothly, jelly bean make an oh-so old dual core processor phone runs buttery-smooth</p>
<p>the price is the second main point, do a comparison between the unsubsidised price of the 2 phone and also, where will you be able to spend $350 for a dual core phone, a HD screen and also will always receive the latest version of what google has made ?</p>
<p>i&#8217;m going with vlad LOL</p>
<p>The quick updates to Nexus phones is just too much of a draw. Google&#8217;s OS updates effectively give you a new phone with capabilities that the latest hero phones just can&#8217;t do. And you have to wait an eternity to get updates on other phones. Yeah, the camera isn&#8217;t tops, but it&#8217;ll do until the next Nexus (or 5) come out this fall/winter.</p>
<p>I  feel like Chris&#8217; argument is contrived.  He kills the Galaxy Nexus for being outdated, but completely ignores the point of the user experience.  Benchmarks are sort of meaningless if the user experience is not up to par.  By all accounts Jelly Bean is a better experience than ICS&#8230;that&#8217;s all that should matter.</p>
<p>After all the iPhone 4S is just as outdated as the Galaxy Nexus and no one complains about it.  Apple users know that its the experience that matter.  And the Verge&#8217;s staff  is well acquainted with Apple Products.</p>
<p>The only real complain that I thought was really valid, was that its that the LTE variant is only available on Verizon.  This is a very true point.  I am on AT&amp;T and I would&#8217;ve gladly considered getting an unlocked Galaxy Nexus (especially at the $349 price&#8230;but even at $399) if it supported AT&amp;T&#8217;s LTE network.</p>
<p>BTW Chris&#8217; comment about the Nexus display.  Its a 720p Super AMOLED display that uses a pentile matrix array not unlike the one on the Galaxy S3.</p>
<p>The truth is at that level of pixel density (over 300dpi) the pentile vs non-pentile argument is almost of purely academic interest.  So yeah, the HTC One X has a better display&#8230;but is it a night and day difference??  And is that really that big of a deal breaker??</p>
<p>Well the difference is huge, but certainly not a deal breaker.  <br />
Although I wish I&#8217;d never seen the One X&#8217;s screen, now other screens seem really&#8230; boring.</p>
<p>According to reports, the SAMOLED part on the GN and GS3 are not the same. GN suffers from color banding and noise at low backlight levels. The GS3 part performs markedly better.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t mean to say they were the same part&#8230;meant to say they are similar&#8230;since they both use exactly the same technology, exactly the same pixel arrangement and are made by the same manufacturer.</p>
<p>So my point was that even if the GS3 part is better I&#8217;d have a hard time thinking it would be monumentally so.</p>
<p>Also that the argument against Pentile Arrangement is silly at these very high pixel density&#8230;it amounts to nit picking.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s false.</p>
<p>Yeah but then&#8230;that also sort of disqualifies the Galaxy S3.  BTW, I like the One X a lot&#8230;but I am done with non Nexus android devices until OEMs start providing software updates in a timely manner.</p>
<p>I bought a Motorola Atrix 2 in October 31.  It came with Gingerbread&#8230;its still on Gingerbread.  I knew my phone was going to take a few months to get ICS&#8230;but not damn near a year.  Its absurd.</p>
<p>(Having said that the freaking Atrix 3 looks spectacular)</p>
<p>Nexus is still the best Android phone.  The SGSIII is hideous and its UI is terrible. The HTC One X is probably the better phone, mostly because of its camera, but Sense is still not where it should be and overall the Nexus is still the better phone because of its abilities and what its capable of after nearly a year of being in stores.</p>
<p>It is a matter of subjective opinion. You rank them as  1) GN, 2) H0X, 3) GS3. Chris Ziegler would rank them as 1) GS3, 2)H0X, 3) GN</p>
<p>We need a vote button to go with articles like these!</p>
<p>Interesting how the argument was structured as a trial with Vlad taking the roll of plaintiff and Chris on the defensive.</p>
<p>Is Vlad saying that Chris isn&#8217;t hood anymore?</p>
<p>I think Josh and Bolster should wade in on this with Dieder.</p>
<p>Love the head to head format of these posts! I think the real answer to this is &#8220;wait until fall&#8221; &#8211; at least it reaffirms that for me, with the upgrade I&#8217;ve had for months now.</p>
<p>WP8, new iPhone, and new Nexus are going head to head, should be one of the most exciting and diverse line ups in years.</p>
<p> - Galaxy S III will probably sell more than Galaxy Nexus and HTC One X combined.</p>
<p> - Google Nexus phones showcase the latest OS and Google  UI/UX on stale hardware.</p>
<p> - HTC One X suffers from crufty single-tasking overbearing Sense, hw/sw button confusion, non removable battery and no removable SD card. Form over function h/w design coupled with poor s/w. Nice screen!</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus is the best Phone, not the best Android Phone.</p>
<p>The GS3 has more muscle, but the  Nexus 5 will be available in 6 months and have even more muscle and the GS3 will still be on 4.0 ICS.</p>
<p>4.0 touchwizz. unless you mean cyanogenmod-ICS. (-:</p>
<p>WAIT until this comes out then and we will see</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/z8tzS" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/z8tzS</a></p>
<p>you mean JB? it just did come out, im compiling it right now, full source has been released to aosp.</p>
<p>I hope the next Nexus phone supports LTE bands because I will buy it outright, straight from Google. Especially if it comes with Key Lime Pie.</p>
<p>Probably the 800Mhz LTE band at least.</p>
<p>Just spent my first week with my new Galaxy Nexus purchased from Google Play, and I must say, between the incredible data speed boost (I left Sprint and their 246kbps download speeds for 3-7mbps at Tmo), the incredible savings of said $29 a month T-Mobile plan, and the utter beauty of unsoiled Android (and yes, touchwiz is still soil), I could NOT be happier.  Going to order the Samsung extended battery as the battery life isn&#8217;t that great, but I am fine using this until another $349-$399 Nexus device(s) appear later this fall.  I&#8217;m quite enamored.</p>
<p><strong>OH I FORGOT TO MENTION</strong></p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus has the least amount of blue I&#8217;ve ever experienced in any display ever.  If you&#8217;ve read anything about the negative affects blue light has on the human body, you will know that this is a HUGE deal.  Whites on the gnex look like slate or paper, and although it may be technically inferior, I find it to be VASTLY more pleasing to the eye than the blaring blue blast of the GS3.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m inclined to agree with Ziegler that running the latest and greatest software is not as important as it was pre-ICS (any ICS running smartphone is on par with <del>or maybe exceeds</del> any other mobile OS out there), I must admit that watching much more underpowered phones getting the newest updates is extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, where every major manufacturer updated it&#8217;s phones in a month&#8217;s time I would&#8217;nt care so much, but we&#8217; re not there yet. I have a GS2, and while it&#8217;s hardware is second only to the newest smartphones from HTC and Samsung, I would trade it for a GNexus anytime. Heck, I would even trade it for a Nexus S, a 2 year old phone that will get the JB update and mine probably won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>These kind of topics could really use a poll though&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s extremely subjective. One person may not care about specs as much as the other, rather being interested in updates and how long their phone will last them or how well it works for them while the other person finds solace in the fact that they&#8217;re running a quad-core cpu or 2GB of RAM etc. Some of us want both. We want top specs along with a guarantee that the phones software will be upgrades as long as it&#8217;s possible. To each his own. Over the span of time of my owning smartphones, I&#8217;ve been all 3 types. I currently consider myself to be the latter.</p>
<p>I think Chris is right in that layering doesn&#8217;t matter too much anymore. It mattered a lot when they were heavy and sucked. They used to take up heaps of very important memory (and in some cases, even storage) and weren&#8217;t really worth it vs. what they changed in the OS, but now most of them are thoughtful and actually give vanilla a better experience.</p>
<p>Vlad is correct also in stating that Android 4.0 is not enough. Devices like these should really have the ability to utilize an upgraded OS and firmware as soon as they are available. You just don&#8217;t get that on a non-Nexus device right now. This is at the fault of OEMs and Carriers *(O&amp;Cs). Because of that, the Galaxy Nexus may well end up being a &#8220;better running&#8221; device than even the GS3 and One X. We&#8217;ll have to see the benchmarks when they&#8217;re out or hear from people that don&#8217;t own the device (unbiased).</p>
<p>In a perfect world, O&amp;Cs would be on the ball regarding updates. Consumers wouldn&#8217;t need to worry about OS updates. The only thing the consumer needs to be concerned with are personal preferences like the look, feel, features and specs of their potential device. Bearing the Nexus name would carry no real stock because every phone would get the next Android asap. In this world, Chris would be right.</p>
<p>If you look at what most Android users complain about, it&#8217;s the terrible statistic showing how stagnant updates tend to be. This is getting much better currently, but it&#8217;s still a sore spot. Many phones which could easily be updated to the next Android or even the current version of Android, are still on the version the phones are sold with. It takes O&amp;Cs months upon months generally to get to the current version and that&#8217;s if they bother at all. If it&#8217;s anything we&#8217;ve seen it&#8217;s that updates can breathe new life into these devices. I have an A500 and ICS vs. Honeycomb were day and night. The tablet is just so much peppier with ICS. If it were the case where they didn&#8217;t do much then it&#8217;d still be bad, but not SO bad.<br />
This is the current world we&#8217;re in, where it seems like O&amp;Cs don&#8217;t really give much of an eff after the phones leave the shelf. In this world the Nexus at least gives it&#8217;s owners something to look forward to. They know that in most scenarios, as long as their phones hardware can handle it, they&#8217;ll be able to upgrade to whatever innovative new features the next Android has to offer and on that, I would agree.</p>
<p>I would rather own the device with a guarantee of getting updates than the device with technically faster hardware, but no guarantee that it will get updates down the line.<br />
Let&#8217;s face it. Gone are the days when all we had to appreciate was the phone for what it had currently (as in, when it was sold to us). These are smartphones, they&#8217;re in some ways, mobile computers and we demand more (as we should). Just as we expect our computers to be upgradeable to the next version of Windows or Linux or OSX, we expect our smartphones to be upgradeable to the next version of Android and the next and the next until the OS can  simply no longer run on the hardware (due to speed, memory or gpu restraints)&#8230;and rightfully so. We invest a lot into these things, whether it&#8217;s raw cash or being locked into a contract or a little of both.</p>
<p>In the end, both of you are right on many levels but you&#8217;re also wrong on a few. I agree and identify more with Vlad because personally, I think it&#8217;s the software that drives and gives the hardware power and while what some may consider the best phones right now are hotter in terms of the tech they use and their superpowers as smartphones, the one thing they lack (quick software updates) will make them eventually fall behind the Nexus in terms of what Android has to offer. So the best phone is whatever the consumer prefers For some it will be the phone that guarantees the update (the galaxy nexus) while for others it is the phone with the fastest hardware and extra features (GS3, One S/X, etc.).</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t buy a Galaxy Nexus right now&#8230;as I mentioned, I consider myself the type of person that wants the great specs AND the updates. At this point the GN is aged imho, so I will get the next Nexus when it comes, as soon as it comes.</p>
<blockquote>I think Chris is right in that layering doesn’t matter too much anymore. It mattered a lot when they were heavy and sucked.  now most of them are thoughtful and actually give vanilla a better experience.<br />
<br />
Vlad is correct also in stating that Android 4.0 is not enough. Devices like these should really have the ability to utilize an upgraded OS and firmware as soon as they are available. You just don’t get that on a non-Nexus device right now. This is at the fault of OEMs and Carriers *(O&amp;Cs). Because of that, the Galaxy Nexus may well end up being a "better running" device than even the GS3 and One X. We’ll have to see the benchmarks when they’re out or hear from people that don’t own the device (unbiased).&quot;</blockquote>
<p>those 2 paragraphs contradict each other.  part of the problem with the skins is that you can&#8217;t get the updates that fast.</p>
<p>Personally I do own the galaxy nexus, I love being able to have jelly bean the day after I/O   If I were able to get a gs3 or one X for free, I&#8217;d probably stick with my nexus. But you&#8217;re right in that it is subjective. I&#8217;m just happy the software and hardware are improving as much as they are. What a fun time to be a gadget geek.</p>
<p>Sidenote: For the next nexus, hardware wise.  I want better battery life and a more scratch resistant screen. Something like the razr max hd with KLP perhaps</p>
<p>Chris, if you&#8217;re going to go down the path of a phone having &#8216;old hardware&#8217; when it&#8217;s not quite a year old, what do you think of the iPhone? Should Apple be releasing one every six months so that it doesn&#8217;t get &#8216;old&#8217;?</p>
<p>Next: Why are these OEMs still making phones with physical buttons? (capacitive or mechanical, either way they&#8217;re static) One of the great things about Android 4.0 is that the virtual buttons get out of your way when you don&#8217;t need them and afford you the entire screen for video. I can&#8217;t get rid of those static buttons and if there were a software update that tweaked the buttons, it would never apply.</p>
<p>Vlad makes the best point about the skins when he mentions that all of the compliments directed at OEMs&#8217; skins have started with how minimal they are.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the skins hold back the updates on countless handsets, which leads to severe fragmentation and makes developers&#8217; lives hell. If Android is to be the primary platform to develop on, it has to be better for the developers. They can&#8217;t be assaulted with &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work on 2.3!&#8221; or &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t work with Samsung <strong>insert model here</strong>&#8221;. Their reward for their effort is an immediate beating.</p>
<p>Looking forward, I have to say that the best thing in the near future will be the onslought of Nexus devices that are coming so that people really have a choice. While they&#8217;re at it, I hope they buy from the Play store and tell their carrier where they can stick their subsidy.</p>
<p>Chris, if we should think about them as their own experience, we should stop calling them Android Phones. Start calling it a TouchWiz phone and a Blur phone. If you compare it to the Kindle Fire, then they should also have their own markets with only apps that are compatible with their custom experience.<br />
That sounds like crap to me, but if we are to think of it this way we should commit to it.</p>
<p>I just want to point out that although the SIII/One X have surpassed the Galaxy Nexus in terms of hardware specs, it is by no means obsolete or outdated. I&#8217;m able to do everything I want with speed (speedier now thanks to Project Butter) and these days, hardware has finally caught up to software in the Android world. So we move forward and focus on the software&#8230;which is where the Galaxy Nexus reigns supreme.</p>
<p>TouchWiz/Sense might add some new features, but none of these can compete with having the latest Android OS months before everything else. And that&#8217;s why I carry my Nexus happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the Galaxy S III is running an operating system based on Android 4.0, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d call it an Android 4.0 phone — it&#8217;s an Android-based phone running Nature UX&#8221;</p>
<p>Ummmm, no.  The UI is different, but the underlying OS is the same.</p>
<p>OS is not just about the underlying  stuff.</p>
<p>Very true, the Nature UX is essentially just a Samsung supported linux distro.</p>
<p>It would have been brilliant to see the Android/Smartphone wars in a desktop context years ago. The most significant differences between linux on the desktop and on the phone is the following:</p>
<p>1. Standardization. Since most linux running smartphones use Android, that helps to provide a consistent set of system utilities and other pieces of software in the stack. Desktop linux has the LSB and can even have software remain portable despite there not being one, but it seems to be a lot more simpler on the phone for some reason.</p>
<p>2. It comes shipped on the hardware. If linux ever took/takes off on the desktop then we would see the same things happening to it that happens to Android.</p>
<p>3. Consistency in the core experience. Despite the different OEM skins/customizations, many of our Android interactions are extremely similar across many phones. If linux ever took off on the desktop, manufacturers would begin to skin it/bring differentiation once there&#8217;s a market for it. My experience is only anecdotal (I work IT on a helpdesk), but some people can&#8217;t configure their wifi without the Dell Wireless Utility. Give them a machine without it and they&#8217;re clueless.</p>
<p>In a perfect world all android phones will get the upgrades as quick as possible. Unfortunately we don&#8217;t live in a perfect world, but buying the Galaxy Nexus will make you feel ahead of the curve and it gives you a better user experience. The android world is devided in hardware updates vs software updates. Because of the imminent release of better hardware and the limit to the amount of money one can spend, some users opt for getting software updates to get a better user experience in comparison to hardware upgraders who want better performance. Software updates are free, hardware upgrades are expensive.</p>
<p>I have to side with Vlad on this one&#8230;</p>
<p>I sold my Galaxy Nexus and got an International HTC One X&#8230; Besides the hardware, I don&#8217;t really see the upgrade anymore. And let&#8217;s face it, the only option for me to run JB before year end would/will be to install a custom rom&#8230;</p>
<p>I like the idea of having a developper team dedicaded to the GNexus, rather than rely on the amateur android community&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not; outdated bluetooth version, poor image sensor, and other shortcomings mean &#8220;the spec&#8221; is still valid, and meaningful.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t buy it now, not after SIII is out, or the One X (both of which, I would root, and load my own aosp ROM onto however&#8230;)</p>
<p>My father is getting getting the GN or the GS3.  I&#8217;m recommending the GN because its unlocked and pentaband HSPA+ and therefore a much more net neutral device.  Hell be able to switch to any carrier in the country should he want to and use the phone overseas.</p>
<p>Vlad won.</p>
<p>Seems to me that if the GNex had a 10mp camera, we wouldn&#8217;t even be having this discussion.  As it is, I do love the GNex and all of its un-skinnedness.</p>
<p>10mp would be crazy. less mp means better image quality=more low light sensitivity. professionals pay thousands and thousands of dollars for cameras starting with 10mp, couple of years ago they started at 4, canons flagship model 1d for example. my nikon d700 (about 1500-3000$ of hightech) has 12. now these cams have HUUUGE sensors, mostly fullframe, the sensor of your phone is tiny compared to it. even 4mp is WAY to much, maybe 1mp would probably do it justice.</p>
<p>Until Google shows off a top of the line Nexus (which they won&#8217;t), its not worth it&#8230; even if you get OTA updates via Google. All of there phones have never been mind blowing or defying. HTC or Samsung comes out with something even better.</p>
<p>I wanna see Google make a Nexus phone that wont fall flat on its face (hardware) wise after 3 months. At least with the Galaxy S 3 and One X, these phones have hardware that can easily last a year +.</p>
<p>A year +? Not really, by your definition they&#8217;re already &#8220;outdated&#8221; once the new Nexus is out.</p>
<p>Tegra 3 is not new, Exynos 5 is literally just around the corner to make Exynos 4 looks like the outdated piece of tech that it is.</p>
<p>Does the argument of dated hardware even matter for most users? There are still people <strong>happily</strong> buying iPhone 3GS&#8217;s. The experience is still smooth and decent on that phone and it should run most, if not all of what people want. The Galaxy Nexus is like that but on steroids. It has specs strong enough to run decent games. Its&#8217; dual core processor is capable of keeping things fluid, the high resolution screen won&#8217;t block off a few great apps (like Avadon for Android [950&#215;550 min] and Gaming App Construction Kit [1024&#215;768]). That 1280&#215;720 screen is beautiful, it&#8217;s going to be well supported for many years.</p>
<p>I had a Motorola Photon 4G. It had a better processor and better utility (Ubuntop/Webtop) but the core resolution of the phone is 960&#215;540. I was effectively cut off from properly running a few apps. I enjoyed email and rss on it, but that higher resolution screen on the Galaxy Nexus is frigging brilliant. Newer phones have come out this year, but they don&#8217;t completely leave the Nexus in a trail of dust. Heck, what&#8217;s the point of having a quadcore processor on a smartphone? Most of the productivity apps don&#8217;t give us a huge, significant jump that makes working on a Galaxy Nexus questionable. Yes, the HTC One X has better specs across the board, but are they worth the price difference between phones? No.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the type of person that can toss a SSD into an aging laptop and be satisfied with the performance gains it will bring. With the exception of gaming and some productivity software, I and many people don&#8217;t need higher powered hardware released today. On telephones, the power doesn&#8217;t matter too much right now.</p>
<p>Yes, the Tegra 2/3 optimized software is nice but it&#8217;s not widespread. It&#8217;s also going to cause headaches in the future and bring in a type of selling system that consumers hate. They want to just look at a phone, see what it can do in ways easily quantifiable to them and make a choice. They will not be thrilled to have to choose between an amazing interface and experience vs X hardware that provides one feature that they want but with an experience they deem to be lesser.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus is a killer device, Google should be selling them directly at retail, but have the user picking the network second. That would be a game changer.</p>
<p>GNexus is faaar from a killer device, the only thing going for it is OTA from Google, and IMO, that&#8217;s not much of a killer device, if the device it&#8217;s self is a little fish in the ocean. Imagine if the device had specs like the GS3 or One X, than it would be a whol different conversation.</p>
<p>Well yeah, but the Gnex is still a very good device for it&#8217;s age compared to other android devices today, considering it came out 7 months ago and it&#8217;s still operating as fast as it was from day one.</p>
<p>What improvements would the specs of a GS3 provide on top of what is already being done?</p>
<p>&#8220;Vlad, it&#8217;s time to stop giving Nexuses a free pass. The GNex should have the same review score as the Lumia 900 and we all know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter. Galaxy Nexus is the best LOOKING phone.</p>
<p>Lies.</p>
<p>OK..you are in denial.</p>
<p>One X looks &gt; SGS3 looks &gt; GNex looks. <br />
Performance: SGS3 &gt; One X &gt; GNex<br />
Camera: SGS3 = Onex, GNex sucks and cant even beleive thy hav that bad camera on a flagship google device.<br />
Software: GNex &gt; SGS3, One X (but if you flash custom roms, SGS3 is best to have since you have awesome hardware and can flash CM1o with JellyBean soon)<br />
Storage: SGS3 (microSD &gt; One X, GNex )</p>
<p>depends what you mean with &#8220;soon.&#8221; cm10 is in the very early stages, my rom bases on it and cm10 for nexus just &#8230; builds. now for nexus they have all the proprietary files, and that WILL create a big mess on other phones. i hear the s2 has no sound, no wifi, no gps, no data, no camera, etc. devs will figure this out eventually but it&#8217;ll take time. ICS for the s2 for example took ages, months, almost half a year. so yeah, when we have key lime, you&#8217;ll probably get jellybean. the argument with that camera &#8230; i am a photographer and its hogwash. its like saying this turd smells better than another. if i want, i make better images with a pinhole camera simply because the device does not make images, you do. if that piece of shit cam on the sg3 is a reason to take it up with touchwizz then good night man. :-/</p>
<p>This is much better imo</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/UyIQ8" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/UyIQ8</a></p>
<p>Reading Vlad&#8217;s point of view has made me look at Android phones differently and I agree that the future of Android will not just be a one OS echo-system, but at the same time I feel that this applies only if you look at these phones as just a phone and nothing else.</p>
<p>What makes these phones so amazing is on the development end. The OS is the basic platform and what powers all the great apps created by developers, but I feel that the true power of any phone or OS is it&#8217;s apps. For too long Android has sufford over it&#8217;s app echo-system or lack there of, just because of the fragmentation that goes on. Developers overlook developing for Android many times because of the daunting task that it takes to wrap your head around multiple screen sizes, variable resolutions, and worst of all running outdated operating systems.</p>
<p>So not only do Android users miss out on certain apps that are beautifully build for iOS, but sometimes the apps that are created for Android have memory leak issues, spamming of data and many other random problems. I&#8217;m a proponent of a closed system if it means that developers can focus on building great products and user experience and not if the 1px line will or will not show up because of screen size or resolution.</p>
<p>Building a great product has so many things involved in it and being able to focus on just your product and not be held back by distractions or limitations is what makes any OS and phone a great product. Say what you will about Apple, but they have the right idea and 5 years later it has been proven to work. Take away the phone and the OS and your still left with amazing apps the help people everyday. I&#8217;m far from ever saying something like that about Android. I hope it gets there, but until developing for it because as easy and efficient as it is for iOS no phone no matter how powerful will still just be a phone that makes phone calls well&#8230;hopefully.</p>
<p>I care about these things:<br />
1.. Buttery experience<br />
2. Interface design that is cohesive with industrial design<br />
3. Features (new notifications)<br />
4. Battery life<br />
GNex actually beats every other phone on everything BUT battery life. Tests show it lasts 3 hours of browsing. Dealbreaker.</p>
<p>its normal that your battery will gain capacity after a while though. first day i switched mine on i was shocked as i heard battery is supposed to be quite good (at the time) but it wasnt. took a few charges and it was quite good. you get 4-5 hours out of it if you sit in a train doing nothing but surfing and gaming. for normal usage 1.5 days is normal for me. it could all be better but its not such a big downer either.</p>
<p>Vlad won the argument.</p>
<p>/argument</p>
<p>I do want a gnex because I love the shape of the phone.  I do have to admit I love my Sgs2 on att but I with it had a bigger screen.</p>
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>This was great, but I have one feature request.  Can the end of the next article like this have a video of the two Verge staffers in a dramatic fist fight / combat scene?</p>
<p>Ok Chris,</p>
<p>Those of you who think Samsung has their act together with the design of Touchwiz Nature UX are crazy. Got the Verizon GS3 a couple days ago and it offends the senses (software look-wise, hardware is great). All UI mods that they&#8217;ve done that differ from stock are just plain ugly.</p>
<blockquote>The stock Ice Cream Sandwich user interface hasn&#8217;t been bettered by either HTC or Samsung, which renders their spec supremacy largely irrelevant and leads to the absurdity of community ROM makers having to work to remove their skinning alterations. </blockquote> <p>&#8212; Vlad Savov</p>
<p>The above statement is only partially true. I agree that neither HTC nor Samsung have improved the ICS stock interface, nor Jelly Bean&#8217;s for that matter. However, the last statement from that quote, that this leads or requires a custom ROM to remove HTC&#8217;s or Sammy&#8217;s skins is patently false.  All a Samsung Galaxy S III owner needs to do to avoid TouchWiz is to install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=nova+launcher" target="new">Nova Launcher</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=apex+launcher" target="new">Apex Launcher</a> from the Google Play store to return to a near ICS stock launcher experience. Both launchers can be customized to a user&#8217;s particular preference above and beyond the ICS stock launcher. But if left with their default settings, both launchers provide a near ICS stock appearance, and are fast and reliable with no perceptible drain on the battery.  This statement is not true for the HTC One X, primarily because HTC&#8217;s Sense overlay has hooks into the Android kernel for multitasking, etc&#8230;. I use  Nova Launcher as my default launcher on my SGS3 and love the experience.</p>
<p>Because of my job, I have both a Galaxy Nexus and a Galaxy S3. They both have their advantages, and drawbacks. So much so that I don&#8217;t believe one phone can be justified as superior over the other. It basically comes down to this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The SGS3 (GT-i9300) has the superior camera, CPU (in particular the international quad core version), battery life, and expandable storage experience.</li>
	<li>The GSM Pentaband (GT-i9250) SGNx has the superior stock software experience, and upgradeability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pick your poison.</p>
<p>a launcher will only do so much to hide the uglyness on your homescreen and that it does. the uglyness is still there and manifests in front of your eyes, puke&#8212;green statusbar, settings, UI elements, dialogs, they are infested. design hell may not be the reason to abandon hardware, the fact that a launcher wont help you to get jellybean/key lemon, etc., any faster, if ever, might. a galaxy nexus runs twice as fluid as the meanest sgs3 right now, and that says something, and its only bound to get better over time.</p>
<p>Just recently I dropped my Galaxy Nexus and shattered the screen and damaged the GPS. I was left with a big decision &#8211; upgrade to new hardware or buy another GN with the knowledge that JB was just around the corner. I chose the latter option. At AUS$400 unlocked the GN is a total steal. And now that I&#8217;m gliding away on JB goodness I almost feel pity to those shelling out twice the cash for dated software. Sure, the GSIII and the HTC One X have better cameras, better screens and more raw power. But when it all boils down to it the user experience is the most important element of a mobile device. Jelly Bean, in my view, is the best mobile experience money can buy &#8211; and I can count on it only get better!</p>
<p>While GS3 and One X are good phones hardware wise, i never was and never will be a fan of touchjiz and nonsense. I have used both and stock android is best for me, every day, every time.</p>
<p>Give me a 2012 nexus phone with a GS3/GS2/One X camera in it and i will be happy. I don&#8217;t care if the skinned phones will be &#8220;miles ahead&#8221;,  i cannot stand the skins and they are pointless. They remind me of the dumbphone era too much.</p>
<p>I actually agree with this. I still think Stock Android is the best, followed by Sense, and Mororola&#8217;s UI being a very close third.</p>
<p>To me, and the price alone sold me. I wanted a new phone and I did not want to lock myself into another 2 year contract to get one and I did not want to spend a fortune on a new phone without a contract. I don&#8217;t need the latest and greatest. I want one with great support and development from enthusiasts.</p>
<p>I switched from a iPhone 4 to the GNEX.  The main reason I switched was the fact that the Nexus line is pure Vanilla.  Yes HTC, Samsung, and even Motorola make some great phones but they are littered with their own custom skins/bloatware.  Also they always get updates months and months later.  With the Nexus you will get updates probably before other phones unless your Verizon! Damn you!</p>
<p>Overall I agree and disagree with the article.  The guy who did the GNEX review had such a heart on for the phone and I think has some major bias.  He thrashed the Razr which in fairness is a good phone and does something that the GNEX does very poorly at, battery life.  It&#8217;s great that GNEXs get Jelly bean first which in a way makes it the most up to date phone for Android BUT, yes a big BUT.  Jelly Bean isn&#8217;t a huge upgrade (I have a Nexus 7) and two the GNEX is running on some aging hardware now, so in that sense I&#8217;d rather take a Galaxy III or a X One.</p>
<p>I hear a lot of boos coming my way but really the best phone is the iPhone 5.  Apple got their $hit together and put LTE, bigger screen, gave people maps, and made the phone thinner/lighter.  If you hate iOS that&#8217;s fine, there are some things I hate about it like iTunes, or under powering CPUs, or creating a locked OS.  But on the other hand I have noticed that I am not a hacker or a guy that tries to mod his phone to push it even further.  I don&#8217;t do custom ROMs and such.  I pick the best phone and stick with it and for a while the GNEX was it.  First to really have an HD screen, had cool features like face recognition, NFC, first to have ICS, huge screen, no shutter lag, etc.</p>
<p>It seems that the Galaxy Nexus Superior might answer the aging problems of the GNEX, but is it enough?  In my opinion a slightly faster processor and a better camera don&#8217;t create a winner.  Nokia and Apple have the best cameras unless Samsung throws us a curve ball and finally can beat them.  The processor isn&#8217;t going to make a huge difference.  I&#8217;d rather see a new thinner design.  The GNEX look chunky compared to the Galaxy III.</p>
<p>So what choices does that leave us if not the GNEX?  You could do Apple as your winner but I bet 95% of the people on this post will say some belligerent thing about Apple products. Each to their own I guess.  I would crown the Galaxy III kind but so many features are half baked.  The HTC X one is nice but not great.  The Note 2 could be a winner but phablets aren&#8217;t for everyone.  So what then?  I beg Samsung to get their $hit together and beat Apple and come out with something original and game changing and for one get rid of the plastic!!!</p>
<p>Great work and best site &#8230;&#8230;Also have seen nice article on <a href="http://techinlead.com/google-galaxy-nexus-android-phone/" target="_blank">http://techinlead.com/google-galaxy-nexus-android-phone/</a></p>
<p>It may help to clarify that this is about the US app. At least in the Netherlands HBO uses a country specific app that so far has not been updated and still crashes on my gnex when trying to start a video. I assume this is the case for many more countries.</p>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Finally Google&#8217;s strategy on Android platform kit is working</p>
<p>That or it&#8217;s basically the same as the nexus 7.<br />
Tegra 3, asus made&#8230;</p>
<p>Asus has always been pretty good about OS updates for their tablets (mostly because they don&#8217;t skin it to death like everyone else).</p>
<p>Any news on the TF101?</p>
<p>Sadly, my gut says it&#8217;s going out to pasture, but I&#8217;m really hoping Jellybean comes to it.</p>
<p>The smoothness would really improve the feel of the original transformer.</p>
<p>Shame, it&#8217;s around 18 months old now. Best in class for android tablets in 2011, had some real innovation with the keyboard. Also, it was actually cheaper than the competition, £429 with the keyboard in the UK.</p>
<p>I think Asus has a chance to show they really provide decent support for their products.<br />
As someone sitting around waiting for 4.0.4 to arrive on my HTC One X I&#8217;m really wondering if any Android manufacturer does.</p>
<p>4.0.4 has already been pushed the One X.</p>
<p>To some phones maybe.<br />
Not to mine and from what I see on the internet not to a lot of other phones either.</p>
<p>Not to mine either. Can&#8217;t stand O2.</p>
<p>Mine is unbranded and sim free so I put all the blame on HTC.</p>
<p>JB on the OG Transformer for would be a very nice final update from Asus. However, I don&#8217;t think it will get it. Asus sent out 4 updates already for it.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t announced for the 101 all the others were.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a JB custom ROM for the TF101 if you want to mess around with it, but it hasn&#8217;t been listed as getting an official update. Asus might be finally cutting it loose.</p>
<p>Tab 10.1 owners are still rocking honeycomb. No wonder google chose Asus&#8230;</p>
<p>all thanks to TouchWiz and having tons of devices out in the market. I seriously hope ASUS starts making phones, that way I can get an ASUS phone if getting a Nexus isn&#8217;t possible, instead of Samsung or HTC, the kings of bloated OEM skins.</p>
<p>Padphone.</p>
<p>Tab 10.1 people already got ICS.<br />

<p>And only 6 months after Asus released it for the Transformer.</p>
<p>Considering how good their last tablets were, I&#8217;m ecstatic about this.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Really good?</p>
<p>Has Google solved android&#8217;s tablet  app deficiency yet ?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>/s***</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really Google&#8217;s responsibility when Android is open-source. It&#8217;s on developers to build better apps.</p>
<p>It really sucks that this is getting Jelly Bean before the Verizon Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>on the one hand, it does suck. but on the other hand, you have a nexus. i&#8217;ve had jelly bean since I/O. the bugless beast ROM is a great stock experience.</p>
<p>This is a few days old so it may not be read, but my point is not about those of us that root their phones. I am also running Bugless Beast. The problem is that my mother and sister who I told to buy the GNex because it would be updated, are still running ICS. If we want the world (as in the non-tech community) to &#8220;vote with their wallets&#8221; and buy the GNex, how can we support that argument when it doesn&#8217;t get updated?</p>
<p>Indeed&#8230; I have a Verizon Gnex and this tablet&#8230; Verizon should be ashamed of themselves.  But I am sure they don&#8217;t care, they are not loosing any customers over this.  Even if they were, it would be insignificant.</p>
<p>Good show Asus. This is how to support a non nexus device.</p>
<p>Now they need to solve their QC issues. Their update speeds are top notch, but a huge list of QC issues. And I hope they learn their lessons fast. The internal components they use are simply not good enough. Their NAND and radios are pathetic. Anyone having a Transformer should run RL Benchmark and check the NAND performance. Really very poor.</p>
<p>I always thought that Jelly Bean was as important to the success of the Nexus 7 as the price and size/form factor was. The TF300T is probably much better for it too.</p>
<p>If only every android OEM was as fast as ASUS at getting updates out..</p>
<p>Asus have been great so far but this is where they get to shine or crap out.<br />
It is a lot easier to provide great updates when you only have 1 or 2 or 3 devices in market.<br />
It is more difficult when you have dozens.<br />
Hopefully they are smart enough to keep the device count manageable and treat them all good for a respectable length of time after release.</p>
<p>How close is the Asus &#8216;rendition&#8217; of Android to stock?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very close to stock. Just some small additions like notification bar toggles and some small visual changes.</p>
<p>Nothing tops being at Google tablet nexus seven owner&#8230;&#8230;.I paid for</p>
<p>The little (well, big) phone that could. Amazing that the HD2 is still chugging along. It&#8217;s unfortunate that HTC hasn&#8217;t produce hardware this solid since&#8230;.</p>
<p>No they are still producing phones with the same hardware three years later&#8230;</p>
<p>No, they&#8217;re actually producing much better performing hardware.. on paper.  Unfortunately Sense has continued its gluttonous relationship with android, being more memory and resource hungry than it ever ways, and the phones just <em>feel</em> like they perform just like the hardware from 2 years ago.</p>
<p>Agreed. I was led to believe Sense 4.0 was going to be very light. Either I can&#8217;t read or someone lied lol</p>
<p>The way I read it (it was late at night and I was tired, so maybe not the best judge), it made it sound like 4.0 was better, but it had miles to go. That it had annoyances like auto killing apps and was still bloated. They said it was better, but not good enough.</p>
<p>Sense had miles to go?? Using a phone with Sense feels like it has 100,000+ miles already on it compared to the Nexus line that feel brand new :)</p>
<p>I Agree.</p>
<p>Thats just the impression I got from one of the reviews a read (I don&#8217;t think it was from The Verge). Maybe it was one of those reviewers that thinks all skins should die in a hole and that he was dissapointed from the promises. I don&#8217;t know where a read that&#8230;</p>
<p>dont worry this fixes that sense problem<br />
<a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com" target="_blank">www.cyanogenmod.com</a></p>
<p>Silver Arrow, you nailed it.</p>
<p>Yes they&#8217;ve rehashed the HD2&#8217;s design many times since&#8230;but I still don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve done it as well as the original.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;No they are still producing phones with the same hardware three years later…</p>
<p>with much worse material though.  I have yet to see HTC make another phone with cool to the touch metal body.  All the new flagship phones use crappy plastic.  Grandly I have seen One S myself yet.</p>
<p>The Nexus One and HTC One X say &#8220;hi&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying their phones since have been BAD &#8211; just not as good. The One series is a step in the right direction, at least.</p>
<p>As both an owner of a HD2 and a One X. The One X is the new HD2.</p>
<p>Long Live the HTC HD2!</p>
<p>It makes the N900 jelly</p>
<p>The originator</p>
<p>Nothing tops the HD2 (or N900 for that matter).</p>
<p>The real iPhone killer. This beast is still awesome and now compare it to the iPhone 3G (which I think was the current model at the time) which is now really slow and pretty much unusable on iOS 4.</p>
<p>3GS, actually. But your point still stands.</p>
<p>My 3GS (released at the same time as the HD2) runs iOS 5 quite fine, frankly. And it will get an official update to iOS 6 this fall. And according to users with a dev account, it runs it quite smoothly as well. So the fact that people are praising so loud a 3 year old Android phone that can be hacked to run the latest version unofficially goes a long way into showing the lack of support Android phones have received in the past 3 years. Hopefully this is going to change &#8211; until that Nexii are the way to go&#8230;</p>
<p>Actually this is a Windows Mobile phone. But since you Apple fanboys only seem to see Android in front of your eyes I guess that&#8217;s a fair mistake to make.</p>
<p>My mistake, I admit. So let me get my sentence corrected:<br />
<blockquote>the fact that people are praising so loud a 3 year old [insert OS name] smartphone that can be hacked to run the latest version unofficially goes a long way into showing the lack of support [insert OS name] phones have received in the past 3 years</blockquote></p>
<p>Applies to WinMo 6.x, WinPhone 7.x, Android, Symbian, BB&#8230; That&#8217;s not how you foster consumer loyalty nor develop a consistent ecosystem/experience across your user base.</p>
<p>Considering that the majority of people upgrade phones every 18-24 months, your point, while valid, doesn&#8217;t carry much weight.</p>
<p>However, good for you for hanging on your your 3GS and the fact that it is still running well for you. That is a good thing.</p>
<p>exactly this is a proof of concept to show htc and all oem&#8217;s to support there devices longer than a few months and that we all can help, just like cyanogenmod or miui, etc, the devs will make it work correctly not the old version htc wants it to have&#8230;</p>
<p>WinMo6.5<br />
Gingerbread<br />
WP7.5<br />
XP<br />
Ubuntu<br />
ICS<br />
JB<br />
WP8???</p>
<p>This phone literally has nine lives.</p>
<p>You forgot MeeGo.</p>
<p>10 lives.</p>
<p>Time for someone to do what needs to be done&#8230; a WebOS port</p>
<p>Pretty sure it&#8217;s already been done too.</p>
<p>Finally, a phone that can beat a cat in a fight. <strong>Link to random cat gifs and videos</strong>.</p>
<p>Pick up my slack gif crazed people and make a gif for this&#8230; :)</p>
<p>literally, eh? I&#8217;m surprised any a phone would &#8220;literally&#8221; have a life.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s another dozen devices with Jelly Bean :-P</p>
<p>JB is freaking awesome.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing Project Butter doesn&#8217;t work on this either because using all the processing power this device has for gestures would break it. Its interesting though. I&#8217;m surprised Google don&#8217;t do what Apple do and allow all their devices to be updated but with limited features.</p>
<p>Apple updates the hardware with the new OS, but keep out some major features either because they want to sell you a new device, or that old hardware won&#8217;t support it properly.</p>
<p>From the point of view of Android manufacturers, it&#8217;s still just as bad, because they&#8217;d still have to upgrade 95% of the OS, and they don&#8217;t want to do that, which is unfortunate.</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t control this. It&#8217;s the manufacturers that don&#8217;t support. phone manufacturers in general aren&#8217;t used to have to update phones, they previously sold you the software with the hardware and that was it. With smartphones, tough, now that the bar was raised by Apple they can&#8217;t match wits.</p>
<p>Is there anything that can&#8217;t run on the HD2? Does someone have iOS on this thing?</p>
<p>What would that be called? HackiPhone (hack-i-phone).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that it can run all this stuff. Most modern phones can. It&#8217;s the fact there is still major support from the hacking community.</p>
<p>I think Windows 7 should be possible (note the lack of the word &#8220;phone&#8221; there). It&#8217;s a monster.  Did HTC put a Xeon in there by mistake?</p>
<p>I saw windows 95 awhile back</p>
<p>This is a beast of a phone, I wish I never sold mine :(</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t regret selling mine&#8230; I just hope whomever bought it has played around with it and hacked anything onto it.  Getting satisfaction from thinking the next owner has done these things.</p>
<p>if this came on the HTC HD7 that would be nice</p>
<p>Most legendary phone EVER! Damn!</p>
<p>I completely agree. I am so glad this phone has received so many praises.</p>
<p>This was the best smartphone released since 2009 untill today. Amazing how it just keeps on rolling.</p>
<p>Now bring 4.1 to the Nokia N900!!</p>
<p>The HD2  is by far the best HTC phone ever made. I finally broke my  HD2 two weeks ago, and I had a hard time finding a phone that matched hardware material quality. The HD2 was strong and durable. Unfortunately, I am still on T-Mobile service and was not able to upgrade to a HTC one X, which is probably the most recent phone that matches the superiority of the HD2. I had to settle for the One S, which has a great body design a.d constructed using strong materials. The screen of the One S is a smaller than my former phone, the HD2, but I enjoy the light weight and slim profile of the One S.</p>
<p>No, both feature a 4.3 inch screen, but the One S has a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio so it is longer and narrower. It also has slightly less screen bezel and beveled edges, so it seems smaller.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about JellyBean 4.1.1 working on the best selling Android phone of all time, the Samsung Galaxy SII. This is a video of it working on the T-Mobile version. It also works on the ATT Skyrocket version. CM10 is coming soon, I smell it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB7hezik9pE" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WB7hezik9pE</a></p>
<p>Is the GS2 older than time itself? Can the GS2 run 9 other operating systems? because thats what this article is really about.</p>
<p>HD2 FTW!  Both my kids have one (sim-less) running ICS for use as tablets.  $120 and one hour of hack time.</p>
<p>This phone kills all other smartphones. It runs every O.S. ever made and it also will run all future smartphone O.S.es</p>
<p>&gt;.&gt; typo at the end&#8230; The verge can add a time limit to edit comments&#8230;</p>
<p>I would not say all future OS until you can predict the future.</p>
<p>The HD2 can.</p>
<p>Just had a look on ebay &#8211; they&#8217;re still over £100 second hand. What a beast.</p>
<p>I still use one of these. Been running Android, WinPhone 7 for last two years on and off. Great phone.</p>
<p>When I worked for Swype, the HD2 and the Omnia 2 were the only WM6 devices for which we released Swype. Aside from the capacitive touch screen, the hardware was no better than the Toshiba TG01, featuring a 1GHz Snapdragon and 512MB of RAM.</p>
<p>The TG01 was a year old by the time the HD2 was released, although the TG01 was never in circulation by any volume as very few carriers picked it up world wide, and I don&#8217;t believe any US carriers carried the device.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m impressed that the HD2 has lasted as long as it has, but it was built on old hardware at the time of its release and has easily been replaced with better hardware since.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t die! IT WON&#8217;T DIE! HELP! KILL IT WITH FIRE!!</p>
<p>Consider my jimmies rather ruffled.</p>
<p>Well, considering the ability to dial emergency services is pretty fricking important, I&#8217;m not all surprised its causing a global delay.</p>
<p>Why we didn&#8217;t have the same emergency services number everywhere in the universe?! Very odd</p>
<p>The process should be as simple as doing a find and replace on 911 for 000. It shouldn&#8217;t be a showstopper. Though I wish we would promote the fact 112 works just as well and is supported on most imported phones.</p>
<p>Though why Android isn&#8217;t either coded to support all national emergency numbers, or would implement it on the basis of a region select screen is a bit odd.</p>
<p>My (limited) understanding is that the issue is a little more complicated than that, I know this is something our telecommunication companies often cite when they fail to push an OEM update in a timely enough manner. Basically they&#8217;re just covering their arses by taking the extra time to make absolutely sure that they don&#8217;t push an update that hinders such an essential service.</p>
<blockquote> global versions of the GSM Nexus S were updated to Android 4.0 at roughly the same time</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a lie, they pulled the OTA after a couple of days due to widespread instability/battery drain complaints. So if you weren&#8217;t in the fraction of devices which got the OTA, you had to sideload the update. GSM Nexus S owners who didn&#8217;t take matters into their own hands (the majority) had to wait till Late March/April to get ICS/4.0.4.</p>
<blockquote>updated to Android 4.0 at roughly the same time</blockquote>
<p>B.S. I bought my nexus s a couple weeks after the initial rollout only to find out there was some battery issue and they halted the rollout&#8230; for 6 months! I didn&#8217;t receive my ICS updates until after I received the one on my tablet. Then again the ICS update on my tablet cause months of issues until an update was put out and it still have performance issues just not crashy ones, thanks Asus.</p>
<p>I think we should eliminate countries. One world government.</p>
<p>We should call that one country as China, haha</p>
<p>This article doesn&#8217;t show up in the verge app or the archive.</p>
<p>On another note where is the research to tell us how Australia&#8217;s emergency cellphone laws are different?</p>
<p>Ummm, this is quite easy to fix lol. Just open up build.prop and add/edit this line:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Default ecclist<br />
ro.ril.ecclist=112,911,#911,*911,999</li>
</ol>
<p>Just add your country&#8217;s emergency number there and it&#8217;ll consider it as an emergency number.</p>
<p>Just to update others, I have received my Jelly Bean update from Vodafone this morning. Running okay so far considering I have little internal free space. I am missing the faux CRT screen turn off effect though&#8230; very good otherwise.</p>
<p>Not being funny but this shows nothing that&#8217;s not already in 4.0. Where&#8217;s the good stuff?</p>
<p>This is a froyo &#8594; gingerbread style update, not a donut&#8594;eclair update.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same car, with a much more powerful engine&#8230; All the difference is under the hood.</p>
<p>Not much has changed, but the things that have don&#8217;t look good.<br />
I like the design of the toggles in 4.0 better than this (TouchWiz anybody?) and I&#8217;m skeptic about the notification area being overloaded.<br />
Although I like the bigger blue bar at the bottom of the notifications and the fact that some design inconsistencies were cleaned up.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe the Verizon Galaxy Nexus still isn&#8217;t updated.</p>
<p>WiFi-only devices always get updates before cellular enabled devices. They cut out the middleman (carriers). :p</p>
<p>Or buy an unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexus and be free of EVIL carriers.</p>
<p>And be stuck with a silly slow network that uses a plastic card to connect? No thanks</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t the takju Nexus from the Play Store get H+21 on AT&amp;T?</p>
<p>This is one of the more stupid comments that I&#8217;ve seen on this site.</p>
<p>Seriously? That gives you freedom&#8230;worldwide.</p>
<p>huh<br />
<img src="http://i.ebayimg.com/t/NEW-Verizon-Wireless-4G-LTE-SIM-card-2FF-Guaranteed-activate-Fast-shipping-/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/$(KGrHqN,!rEE88gWmzoBBP(ShVTplg~~60_35.JPG" /></p>
<p>Beat me to it. Love, Love, love this comment, and the irony of the original comment.</p>
<p>At least sprints is integrated. Sims are only good if you are rich and travel the world. Most normal humans aka Americans do not</p>
<p>Not so sure about that, where I come from SIM cards are just $1-$1.2 per piece, yeah.</p>
<p>In the UK sim cards are free. You just pay the contract price or pay as you go price.</p>
<p>Oh, so I&#8217;m not considered a normal human if I&#8217;m not from the US?</p>
<p>you really are an asshole if you only consider Americans normal humans. <br />
<blockquote>Sims are only good if you are rich</blockquote><br />
Sim cards are free all over Europe</p>
<p>Well I don&#8217;t get the hype about 4G anyway, but this is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>I get about 25 mb download and about 14 mb upload speeds on my Verizon LTE Galaxy Nexus. It isn&#8217;t hype its useful in the way a cable modem was an advance over dial up. Do you use dial up at home? Probably not and for good reason.</p>
<p>A use scenario is a WiFi hotspot where you can work remotely. I was on the president of my companies boat and was able to download 2gb of Vector charts/maps for a new GPS computer.  very useful and my company pays for it.  Air card routers are great for remote and temporary job sites as well.</p>
<p>Sir, Do you realize. This give you freedom, and help people to recycle tech devices. Which otherwise add to electronic waste as people cannot handover or sell their used device at will.</p>
<p>Even if you work for Verizon, Restrain from talking like this.<br />
Thankyou.</p>
<p>Wat. Who makes fun of SIM cards?</p>
<p>People who like going somewhere or making a 30 minute long phone call to change devices.  Oh, also people who like having their phones locked to one networks.  Ah, and lastly, people who like paying a premium because they can&#8217;t use GSM phones which are sold unlocked worldwide.</p>
<p>As a Sprint Galaxy Nexus user who doesn&#8217;t want to root, I feel the Verizon users pain.</p>
<p>why so scared of rooting? Tbh, there is no risk and if you do something stupid with the hardware (say drop it) warranty is not covering that any way.</p>
<p>If the phone is working great after 6 months, there is generaly nothing the warranty will cover that can happen to it &#8211; unless you allready have a proven error with say, screen or buttons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s just nice not having to do anything.  I completely sympathize for those who don&#8217;t want to root.</p>
<p>-Galaxy Nexus Owner.</p>
<p>Why is that hard to believe?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s past &#8220;mid-July&#8221;, though I forgot that this is Google we&#8217;re dealing with.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s Verizon we&#8217;re dealing with. It&#8217;s Verizon&#8217;s phone, so Verizon take an ice age anda day to push the update out.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 was promised by mid-july.  Promise fulfilled.  JB was said to come to the Xoom and Nexus devices by the <strong>end</strong> of July.</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>So it seems that the two bar approach is only for 7 inch devices. Android&#8217;s whole slowly go from phone to tablet thing with bigger screen sizes is interesting.</p>
<p>They totally typo&#8217;d my screen name in the article. Lol&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks, <em>Lettershort</em>!</p>
<p>The Verge staff may not love you, but we do.</p>
<p>Thanks. =-D</p>
<p>Well atleast the link works.</p>
<p>There is that much. =-D</p>
<p>I think Lettershor would have at least been more ironic</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it, though? It&#8217;d&#8217;ve be great, actually, considering that the screen name Lettershort is a reference to the old days when user names where limited in length&#8212;and that name you wanted to use, well, it was always a letter short of being usable.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a (puts on sunglasses) letter short.</p>
<p>Yup, my Xoom got the update tonight and is now running Jelly Bean. :) One interesting thing to note &#8211; the animated boot-up screen does not get updated to the new style (the multi-colored X logo) that&#8217;s used with both the Nexus 7 tablet and the Galaxy Nexus phone; it keeps the old ICS-style boot screen with the multi-colored geometric shapes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the &#8220;X&#8221; boot screen is associated with the Nexus line, rather than with Android 4.1 &#8220;Jelly Bean&#8221;.</p>
<p>UGHHH I read that title and got super excited. Then I read it and realized that it&#8217;s for the Xoom WiFi&#8230;</p>
<p>EFFFF YOU VZW!</p>
<p>Thankfully I put the US rom on my UK XOOM when I got it. Now updated to 4.1.1</p>
<p>I did the same :-) looking forward to getting home and checking for the ota. It&#8217;d better be there! Left t on the check for updates screen this morning just in case lol</p>
<p>The Xoom is a nexus device? since when?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a Nexus device, but it is is &#8220;Google Experience Device&#8221;&#8212;basically the closest thing to a Nexus device before &#8216;Nexus&#8217; became a thing.</p>
<p>The Xoom is not a Google experience device. The US Xoom is. The UK Xoom for example is still on Honeycomb.</p>
<p>The update will come soon. JUst because the update hasn&#8217;t rolled out to users in a different continent doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t a Google Experience Device.</p>
<p>Theaolway is right. Moto have confirmed as much.</p>
<p>I am not big on cursing but believe in it for effect.<br />
It is on honeycomb FFS. You know the version before ICS. The first non US Xoom to get ICS was the Canadian one and that was just over a month ago.</p>
<p>Nexus was a thing before the Xoom &#8211; I think the reason the Xoom was a GED and not a Nexus was because Honeycomb&#8217;s source was never released.</p>
<p>That said, I believe the OG DROID was a GED, so I dunno.</p>
<p>UK Xoom is still running on 3.2 &#8230; clearly been &#8216;killed off&#8217; by Googlerola.</p>
<p>Clearly need to Root and Rom if I&#8217;m going to use it any more. Will mean the 3G won&#8217;t work any more, but the device is going to be useless soon running on such an old version of the OS.</p>
<p>As I said above: just because the update hasn&#8217;t rolled out to UK users yet, that doesn&#8217;t mean it never will. The article says it&#8217;s possible this a limited roll out in the US before it&#8217;s released to the masses.</p>
<p>Please read. The UK Xoom does not even have ICS yet. You know, the version released eight months ago.</p>
<p>I bought the UK wi-fi xoom and flashed ICS when it was available. I&#8217;m running JB as of this morning&#8230; Bite the bullet and flash ICS would be my advice.</p>
<p>Krusi has the 3g version though, so not an option.</p>
<p>Motorola released 3g ICS for France last month. He could flash that on. ICS is a lot nicer than HC.</p>
<p>Still haven&#8217;t gotten it on my Nexus S. Damn it Vodafone Australia.</p>
<p>In the other news saw some Chinese tablets also rolling on 4.1.1 on DualCore Amlogic 8726 MX Cortex A9 based devices.</p>
<p>Biggies HurryUp.</p>
<p>Wow&#8230; Sometimes I wonder why I bought this Sprint GNex,.  This whole update delay is maddening.</p>
<p>They may be FAT, but they have a great personality&#8230;</p>
<p>Wayyyy to get my hopes up!</p>
<p>US Xoom WiFi here&#8230;no system updates :-(</p>
<p>Same here :-( wish there was a way to force it once its rolling out. Still, at least we&#8217;re way ahead of almost everyone else :-)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very curious to see how Jelly Bean (especially the buttery smoothness part) will perform on last-gen/under-specced hardware.  It&#8217;d be great to be able to throw JB on an old phone and completely revitalize it as a PMP or remote</p>
<p>According to a friend of mine, CM9 runs great on his Kindle Fire. I can only assume that JB will be a pretty great experience as well.</p>
<p>I heard that there&#8217;s a JB port in the works for the B&amp;N Nook Color. That is nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p>Just installed this a few hours ago. The right gapps is from 7/11, not the one Hash posted.</p>
<p>The standby is amazing. I&#8217;ve never had good standby on an ICS ROM.</p>
<p>Amen. All KF ICS ROMs had poor standby time even with wifi off and other tweaks.</p>
<p>Android tablet app ecosystem sucks, news at 11.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been 2 years since android tablets been out &amp;……yea</p>
<p>To be fair no one started using them until Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Are there any concrete Nexus 7 numbers yet? I know Android owns nearly half the tablet market now (and I own a N7 myself) but I never actually see real sales numbers for tablets.</p>
<p>you&#8217;d have to be counting Amazon for that. And then it might be 30%, if that.</p>
<p>no, really, if you count Amazon in, Android is nearly half the tablet market now:</p>
<p><img src="http://phandroid.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PJ_12_09_17_tabletNews-report_02.png" /></p>
<p>Apple iPad&#8217;s market share dropped dramatically from where it was in 2011. It will soon be overtaken by Android if things continue as they are. And rightly so.</p>
<p>If any big change occurs in the market, that would be the introduction of Windows 8 tablets, and that would take another big bite out of iPad&#8217;s share. I can&#8217;t wait for that to happen.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s comparing mostly 7&quot; android tablets to the 9.7" iPad, so it&#8217;s not really a direct comparison, especialy when comparing the app ecosystem.<br />
I hope Microsoft can compete in the ~10&quot; market.</p>
<p>The same thing that happened with smartphones is happening with tablets. Apple moves first and commands a seemingly huge lead, but 2-4 years down the track, Android overwhelms on numbers due to the diversity of manufacturers and form factors it runs. Apple still retains much better margins than the Android manufacturers, but as a customer rather than a share-holder, that&#8217;s immaterial.</p>
<p>yeah, Apple keeps reporting on how far they are ahead of the Android manufacturers and all (in terms of shipments/sells &#8211; well, the tech companies have a habit of throwing these numbers around wildly, they don&#8217;t even mean the same thing), but that is comparing with each manufacturer individually.</p>
<p>But if you compare the platforms, namely iOS vs Android, regardless of manufacturer, it&#8217;s no surprise that Android will catch up &#8211; and surpass iOS market share &#8211; just look at the sheer number of Android manufacturers compare to just Apple making iOS devices. In fact I&#8217;m amazed that it has taken this long for Android to reach nearly half the tablet market share.</p>
<p>*sales</p>
<p>It took until 2010 (that&#8217;s 3-4 years after the iPhone 1) for there to be really credible competition in the same price range as the iPhone. It&#8217;s just 2 years after the original iPad. Next year has Windows 8 as well as Android tablet makers further refining their tablets for Jelly Bean and whatever succesors it has. There&#8217;s still plenty of time left for it to still fit the pattern.</p>
<p>Not just shareholders, even for customers iOS still trumps with the best apps.</p>
<p>Do customers actually win anything by having lots of users but no quality?</p>
<p>Wow, wonderful false dichotomy you have there&#8230;</p>
<p>to be fair, you are a backassward idiot.</p>
<p>I wish they had a better definition of what they mean by ecosystem.  If ecosystem is solely the app selection I think the score should be lowered.  Apple clearly has a much better selection of apps and their apps are mostly of a higher caliber.  If you count ecosystem as how well it integrates with other services  (expected to be used with the device) the score should be higher.  There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of an argument at how well Android devices integrate with Gmail, Google calendar, Google music, Chrome, G+ and even maps.  Being able to open tabs from a computer or create a music playlist from any device with a browser and have it appear on your mobile device has to count for something.</p>
<p>I would just like to know how the ecosystem score is decided considering there have been several questions the last few weeks about this score on several reviews.</p>
<p>Yes, we would all like some transparency on that.</p>
<p>It would be better if they mentioned it as app ecosystem or hardware ecosystem or third party accessories ecosystem.</p>
<p>Yes, unclear. As a prime owner myself, Asus does add a couple nice custom apps that are exclusive to it&#8217;s ecosystem:<br />
- A free version of Splashtop (used to remote control your PC)<br />
- App for streaming to compatible Windows streaming devices (eg. XBox) (haven&#8217;t tested this myself, as I don&#8217;t have one)<br />
- Also stock OS tweaks are minimal, offhand the only noticeable one is a nice menu bar lock feature, which is great if you have kids or play games on it</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve also skinned the notification panel to add the usual WiFi/GPS/BT toggles, which usually require a second tap on stock.  You can switch off the enhanced notification panel if you want, though.</p>
<p>The media streamer is DLNA, so it can stream to a lot more than just XBox and Windows.  It streams to my LG TV and Samsung Blu-ray player without a problem (provided the files are compatible).</p>
<p>But for me the question I always ask is how many Apps does a person ever need? What&#8217;s going to happen when we reach 10 million Apps one day? 5 million Apps will now be rated not enough? I never get the hype about apps unless every one needs 100 apps to make their device function</p>
<p>Everyone needs a different 100 apps. Some of these apps become crucial too, I know there are a few medical apps which basically put Android out of contention for some of the doctors I know.</p>
<p>Although app growth will surely slow down well before we get to millions upon millions of them.</p>
<p>Nonsense, most people need the same core apps. A good e-mail app, a good browser, a few <strong>popular</strong> games, text editing/note taking, image viewer, video player, video chat software, social networking apps &#8212; those are the main uses of any computer, and 90% of all people have exactly the same needs. There are then 10% of the people that would want 10% of their apps to be custom, but that shouldn&#8217;t affect the rest&#8230; Besides, why wouldn&#8217;t app vendors provide the specialized professional apps for each major platform?</p>
<p>Because thanks to the rampant piracy on Android (which Google has just been making moves to fix recently), App developers will prefer to make Apps for iOS only (or iOs first, then Android much later). Especially the high margin specialty apps that many professionals would need to justify their purchase of a tablet for work.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s with these wild &#8220;Android is only for people that love rampant piracy,&#8221; accusations?  I can say for myself that the only thing I&#8217;ve ever pirated on Android was Pokemon Emerald, which I own in physical form.  Just because you can sideload things doesn&#8217;t mean that people will use that for piracy.  The vast majority of Android users don&#8217;t even know how.</p>
<p>Judging from the malware being reported from side-loaded apps, a lot of users seem to be able to bumble their way through checking the &#8220;Allow Side-loaded content&#8221; button thing.</p>
<p>&#8230;but I think (not sure) that a lot of developer aren&#8217;t using the security tools that Google has provided to lock down their apps.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about developers locking down their apps, it&#8217;s about semi-literate users downloading adulterated apps from pirate sites without realizing what they&#8217;re inviting in.</p>

<p>Regarding the rampant piracy on Android that you spoke of, it isn&#8217;t like Apple doesn&#8217;t have it. Countless people jailbreak their iOS devices only to be able to use Installous for getting pretty much any paid app for free,. Also, on most Android apps, directly installing a paid app from its APK will render it useless when your device first connects to the internet and can&#8217;t identify it as purchased through the Play Store. This capability has been provided by Google; the developers only have to implement it in the app&#8217;s code. When it comes to piracy via Installous on jailbroken iOS devices though, there is no such measure provided by Apple that I know of.</p>
<p>Yes this capability has been provided by Google only on the more recent Android versions. Because of how hung up most devices are on 2.x Android, developers have to make trade-offs. And some of those trade-offs are making a shitty Android app and an awesome iOS app because of the ROI they get from each platform. I&#8217;m an Android user, and even though I love Android to bits, I&#8217;m not blind to the flaws of the platform.</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that people pirate specialized apps, such as the medical apps that were mentioned above? I would like to see some hard data on that before I take it seriously.</p>
<p>Oh yes, the &#8216;rampant piracy on Android&#8217; that we&#8217;ll just pretend doesn&#8217;t exist at all on iOS.  According to this article, the majority of piracy occurs in China and the rate of piracy is comparable for both iOS and Android.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/piracy-rates-are-higher-ios-android-wind-up-knight-developer-104305/" target="_blank">http://www.androidauthority.com/piracy-rates-are-higher-ios-android-wind-up-knight-developer-104305/</a></p>
<p>You just like a lot of other poeple have no clue whats going on and just cling on to made up things that have no actual fact. The real reason is that you make more money on iOS, the reason being that on android there is a huge app selection that is free, so for most things you want there is a free option that is close to as good. There 2 different platforms and thus need different way of making money, its the reason things like angry birds offer a free ad driven version on android and so on.</p>
<p>I would think iOS offers greater numbers of people with priated apps as it is well known that you just jailbreak and get Installous, were us a lot of people on android have no clue that you can sideload app.</p>
<p>Also now days most apps are made for android and iOS at the same time</p>
<p>As an Android tablet user, all android tablet apps suck. WebOS on my HP TouchPad has far better tablet optimized apps. Still haven&#8217;t found a document app that competes with iPad or webOS versions, Facebook and Twitter are obviously written for phones. If you&#8217;re not a geek, the iPad is the only 10&quot; option still. You can run phone apps on a Nexus 7.</p>
<blockquote>all android tablet apps suck</blockquote>
<p>1. Browser<br />
2. Email<br />
3. Video playback<br />
4. Skype<br />
5. PDF reader</p>
<p>All of the above suck, really? Excuse me if I don&#8217;t take you seriously.</p>
<p>and to add to that</p>
<p>hulu+<br />
hbo go<br />
Kayak<br />
Zillow</p>
<p>yeah they all suck as well too huh?   So exuce me as well If I don&#8217;t not only take you seriously but don&#8217;t believe you at all.</p>
<p>HBO Go does suck.  I&#8217;m happy to have it anyway because of the access it provides to great content, but the app sucks.  YouTube is 10x faster.</p>
<p>Agreed. I believe it displays video in 480p on my 720p phone. I haven&#8217;t tried it on my Transformer Prime yet, but I&#8217;m sure it will still be 480p. I just use Dolphin Browser to go to HBO.com because it displays in full 720p on my phone. I don&#8217;t think they stream 1080p through their website unfortunately.</p>
<p>facebook and twitter are absent from your list. Wonder why? ;D</p>
<p>When someone says &#8220;all android tablet apps suck,&#8221; someone else who disagrees with them doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to think that <em>no</em> Android tablet apps suck.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a diverse and expansive list of third party apps you have there.</p>
<p>I believe Apple pays Facebook &amp; Twitter to make sure their Android apps suck major donkey, especially on 1920&#215;1200 tablets.</p>
<p>I think somehow, someway, we&#8217;ll be able to figure that one out.</p>
<p>Do you also think the world only needs 100 books?</p>
<p>Pathetic strawman analogy and spurious similarity.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you know what a strawman analogy is.</p>
<p>Actually, I do, and he&#8217;s grasping at straws. It&#8217;s a bad analogy. End of story.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a strawman analogy.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man</a></p>
<p>so you don&#8217;t think<br />
&#8220;Do you think the world only needs a 100 books&#8221;</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>a  informal fallacy based on misrepresentation of an opponent&#8217;s position</p>
<p>actually that is exactly what he did.   I find it odd that even with the definition of a straw man  that YOU LINKED  you are the one that doesn&#8217;t know what it means.<br />
the irony.</p>
<p>or is that the wrong usage of irony?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also correct, Android tablet apps suck out loud and while there are a few third-party replacements for Twitter and Facebook, they suck out loud.  Plume&#8217;s okay for Twitter.</p>
<p>Also he implied that &#8220;grasping at straws&#8221; = strawman</p>
<p>So you are saying Android apps suck out loud because there isn&#8217;t an offial Facebook app.  never mind that you can book mark the webpage but ok</p>
<p>So the official Face book app has been on the iPad for less than a year.   So according to your assement  all of the iPad&#8217;s apps sucked out loud because there wasn&#8217;t a Facebook app.</p>
<p>to pin an entire cataolog based on two apps is just tad bit short sighted don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>was the iPad useless before the Facebook and twitter apps?</p>
<p>There <strong>is</strong> an official Facebook app for Android though&#8230;</p>
<p>but not officially optimized for the tablet.   Though that is suppose to be changing very soon as Facebook is apparently putting the finishing touches on a native Android app.</p>
<p>nearly 3 years too late buddy</p>
<p>and when did the iPad app come out?</p>
<p>Why does it matter? It doesn&#8217;t exist on Android. Oh that&#8217;s okay though right cause your phone app scales perfectly. Android will never have a need for a FB tablet app. Oh yeah you can bookmark the website!</p>
<p>so you ARE  saying the iPad and the iPad 2 ( for most of it&#8217;s existance) sucked out loud because they Facebook didn&#8217;t have an app for it.</p>
<p>Ok thanks I&#8217;m glad we cleared that up.</p>
<p>Hey, now there&#8217;s a real straw man!  dailycup didn&#8217;t say the Transformer &#8220;sucks out loud.&#8221;  They said the apps for it do.</p>
<p>(Not that I agree with that position; but it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that you just used a straw man fallacy).</p>
<p>boom</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the quantity of apps but the quality. Have you ever even tried using a simple app like Facebook or Twitter on an Android tablet? It&#8217;s leagues behind its iOS counterpart. A lot of the best apps and games are exclusive to iOS as well. It took Android over a year to even get something as simple as Instagram. When I first got my Galaxy Nexus, I wasn&#8217;t able to even get things like HBO Go and Netflix to work for at least 3-4 months due to it not being supported on ICS. Android has a long way to go before the Play Store is anywhere near what the App Store is at now.</p>
<p>I use a web browser to access FB and Twitter on my laptop, why would I want anything different on a large tablet? It&#8217;s good to have an app in the phone, because of size limitations, but I see no point for it on a tablet.</p>
<p>Oh I see, <em>you</em> don&#8217;t need it. I&#8217;ll be deleting it from my iPad now.</p>
<p>Yet you don&#8217;t provide any insight why you need it.</p>
<p>How bout wanting it?</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>apps function better than web pages.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just an app that sits there for my convenience. Do I use it often? No. My iPad is for when I&#8217;m lounging around and don&#8217;t want to surf on my iMac/iPhone. I don&#8217;t like to sit infront of my PC, I like to be able to receive push notifications, only using Facebook via Safari doesn&#8217;t allow push notifications and I&#8217;m definitely not enabling email notifications.</p>
<p>So for the few times I do use it, it is reliable (since the update) and convenient.</p>
<p>Main usages: Push notifications. Lounging around the home.</p>
<p>Integration with the tablet&#8217;s notification system would be the biggie for me.</p>
<p>There are plenty of apps that provide the notifications. Most of them are arguably good enough to completely replace the browser. The whole thing is a non-issue.</p>
<p>it integrates with your email.</p>
<p>Nobody should WANT instagram, but if that&#8217;s something people are actually interested in, there were (and are ) many alternatives on the Android store. Name != function.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use the HBO GO app on your Nexus dude. It&#8217;s low-res crap compared to using it thru a browser. Also, I was using NetFlix on my gnex when I got it last year, thanks to XDA.<br />
Basically you fail at using your GNex.<br />
However, I agree that the Play Store doesn&#8217;t live up to the App Store. I wish the Play Store had better organization. I wish it had a dedicated section for apps that I purchased. If I go to the newer &#8220;my apps&#8221; area, it shows me EVERY SINGLE APP I EVER DOWNLOADED! I just wanted to install the apps I paid for but I had to scroll through a list of around 1000 apps and pick out the 50 or 60 paid apps that I wanted. Shit like this makes me hate the Play Store.</p>
<p>Is there a site where you can list key mobile apps and then see which OS support them?   I&#8217;m on an iPhone now and most of my apps aren&#8217;t mission critical, but I have 8-10 that would be hard to go without.  Evernote, for example.</p>
<p>Evernote is pretty fantastic on Android phones AND tablets (one of the few).</p>
<p>Because of choice. I have an iPhone 4S as well as an HTC One X. My Android phone can&#8217;t be used for work because it is missing some apps. For example there is absolutely no VersionOne client. And the apps that are there aren&#8217;t as good. Sure on iOS we have SEVERAL financial apps. But because of that I can choose the one that&#8217;s right for me instead of being forced to use the only one that&#8217;s available, or to choose from few. On iOS I use the combination of PocketMoney and BillMinder. BillMinder can send my paid bills to PocketMoney for added convenience. There are a few choices for Android, but none provide the features I need, nor do they communicate with my favorite personal finance program. PocketMoney exists on Android by the way, it is just nowhere near as good. And no bill management features can talk to it. I know it&#8217;s small &#8230; but this is the reason for hundreds of apps. More competition amongst them makes them better.</p>
<p>so it sucks because you don&#8217;t know how to use it?</p>
<p>When I had an Android tablet, I said &#8220;Who needs apps too?&#8221; I extended it to say, &#8220;I have a browser, why do I need apps?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then I got an iPad.</p>
<p>Cool story, bro.</p>
<p>and then you went braindead</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always felt it was pretty apparent that the ranking of an app ecosystem is based on the number of apps as well as the quality of apps, or mainly the number of quality apps. <br />
iOS has a plethora of very high quality apps. Android phones have really been catching up lately with the number of high quality apps (as well as having even more totally useless and poorly implemented ones), unfortunately this doesn&#8217;t extend to their 10 inch tablets and thus it is reasonable to nick them for it as this is something a consumer would be greatly affected by upon purchasing one.</p>
<p>Maybe their score accounts for both, which is why it is in between what you expect for those two categories. Although the device integrates we;; with lots of great google services, (score of 9), there are very few prime apps available for it (score of 3) and the average score for the ecosystem is 6.</p>
<p>Am I the only one that&#8217;s bothered when they compare directly ecosystems? Like, it&#8217;s not useful &#8211; it would be much more useful to define how well featured an ecosystem is. If it has everything I need, it doesn&#8217;t matter how big it is in comparison to other ecosystems.</p>
<blockquote>Am I the only one that’s bothered when they compare directly ecosystems? Like, it’s not useful – it would be much more useful to define how well featured an ecosystem is.</blockquote>
<p>Amen.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a category that bothers me because your trip over the line between &#8220;review&#8221; and &#8220;buying guide&#8221; when you do that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bullshit category; its only purpose is to give extra points to iOS while appearing objective.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind comparing ecosystems within reason, because sometimes people are deciding between ecosystems.</p>
<p>Ironically, the ecosystem comparison I was most curious about didn&#8217;t make it into the review, though: I&#8217;d love to see how this compares with one of the nicer Chromebooks as a lightweight Google netbook.</p>
<p>But what is &#8220;everything I need?&#8221; Everything <em>you</em> need is not the same as everything <em>I</em> need. Do you need a Google Analytics app or a Linkshare app to track clicks on mobile apps/websites? Probably not, but I do. Not to mention how the mobile marketplace is constantly changing.</p>
<p>Nobody cared if WM6 had a twitter app 5 years ago. Now it is a dead platform if you don&#8217;t have one. The majority of basic apps are covered on iOS and Android now, but just because an app exists for a certain use it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it is a good experience. Usually a decent app is released to complete a certain task, and other developers take the idea and run with it, ending up with a much improved app. Which is why having &#8220;more&#8221; apps available is a good thing&#8230;more competition between developers.</p>
<p>I rather have apps that are just upscaled on tablets rather than&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2010/01/appletabletb317_01.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then press the 2x button.</p>
<p>Not that this is actually a problem with the iPad anymore.</p>
<p>and look at the pixelation and unreadable text.  iOS has one of the worst scalers.</p>
<p>I have an ipad and not one scaled app.  I dont think that is much of an issue now., and Google needs to ger their tablet apps organizes no excuses..</p>
<p>I have a pile of scaled apps.  They are awful, and htere is no excuse for it.  My ipad 2 is not that much higher resolution than my iphone</p>
<p>So get RetinaPad, or Fullforce, if you want that kind of scaling.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have The Verge app in your ipad? Yeah that&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s always the browser.</p>
<p>hahah anymore. they have all new problems now</p>
<p>Wow, Android fanboys try to do the same thing with Apple as WP fans do with Android: Pretending their OS is competing against the past.</p>
<p>Also theyre bringing up the ecosystem argument. WP also has a fantastic ecosystem, in terms of services and software to accompany it. But the other part of the ecosystem, ie apps, is what it lacks. When WP fans try to argue that, Android fans are quick to shoo us away. Now they bring it up here to get a pass for their sucky Android tablet ecosystem and expect us to accept it lol.</p>
<p>If you have an Instagram iPad app then please provide me a link. I use that as an example because there are a lot of apps with MILLIONS of users that still don&#8217;t have an iPad app.</p>
<p>And idiot apple fanboys hang out in android tablet threads that threaten their manhood.</p>
<p>The great thing about the iPad is you don&#8217;t have to even think about scaling since all the apps you want have already been written for it&#8217;s native resolution.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re writing this in the Verge app on the ipad, right? Right?!</p>
<p>There is no Verge tablet app.  If they ever get around to making one it will be released on the iPad and months later they might get around to adding a Tablet UI to the Android app.</p>
<p>but you want to know what&#8217;s funny?  The Verge app on an Android Tablet scales really nice, granted no landscape support but portrait it&#8217;s looks pretty solid.</p>
<p>That defeats the purpose though.  Even if the text and pictures are sharp the app is not designed for a larger screen so you get tons of wasted space.  Until The verge gets around to making a tablet app, the experience if always going to be better viewing it in a browser whether you&#8217;re on an Android tablet or an iPad.</p>
<p>I agree to a point.  but thats the what&#8217;s available now and that is one of the benefits to the Android OS, they way it handles scaling.</p>
<p>I agree and I look forward to a Tablet optimized Verge app but that&#8217;s not the reality now.   and is the case for many really nice apps.</p>
<p>the way the verge app looks like on my Android tablet is really solid.  text and photo&#8217;s and images all scaled beautifully to size.</p>
<p>just sayin</p>
<p>Weird because the apps I have seen on my mom&#8217;s iPad (iPads are GREAT for moms and other people that are afraid of technology) all scaled like shit, 480&#215;320 on a 10&quot; screen = awful. Apps like Draw Something &amp; Hangin&#8217; With Friends have tens of millions of downloads and had no HD version available, though I&#8217;m sure the HD version would cost $2.99 or $4.99 anyway. Maybe they finally have HD versions now, but on Android the devs don&#8217;t have to release special HD versions and charge more money for them because the apps just scale well. This is the biggest flaw with the iPad in my opinion.<br />
My big problem with apps on my TF700 is apps that are forced into portrait mode. The devs need to pull their heads out and offer both orientations for their apps. Then there are apps with both orientations in the same app (I&#8217;m looking at you Netflix and ESPN FFL).</p>
<p>The problem with your assertion is that, way more Android apps get the privilege of scaling (so nicely) to fit the screen than there are iPad apps (especially games), that aren&#8217;t tablet optimized.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I think Google could really help fix this by adopting something prominent like Apple&#8217;s + &#8216;UB&#8217; symbol for tablet-optimized apps, as a way of shaming developers who don&#8217;t do it.  Given the crutch of desktop-style scaling, there needs to be some other mechanism of motivating people to make the change.</p>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s a huge bezel!</p>
<p>Man, I haven&#8217;t seen that in around two years now. But just keep on trolling.</p>
<p>All the specs in the world don&#8217;t mean nothing with a fluid os &amp; a strong app, music, video ecosystem</p>
<p>So&#8230;Nexus 7 with Google Play (Books, Movie, Magazin) ?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a review of the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>hmm  <br />
google music<br />
google movies<br />
Amazon MP3<br />
Netflix<br />
HBO Go<br />
shall I keep going?</p>
<p>no, don&#8217;t feed the troll</p>
<p>How much of that is available outside of the USA?</p>
<p>None of them are available in India. :( Other than TuneIn Radio and 8Tracks, I can&#8217;t stream English songs on any of my iOS or Android device.</p>
<p>Google Books &amp; Google Movies are both available outside the USA with the exception of Google Music. Netflix and HBO are American and countries outside the centre of the universe (USA) have their own competing services.</p>
<p>We have Netflix here in the UK and I believe they have it in Canada.</p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head!</p>
<p>Google is not doing nearly enough to capture the non-English language markets. All of continental Europe + BRIC is a huge market that&#8217;s still being neglected.</p>
<p>Yeah, definitely no Android phones being sold in BRIC countries.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re discussing the &#8220;ecosystem&#8221;. Google Music, Google Movies, etc. Also, I wouldn&#8217;t say no Nexus 7 being sold outside of USA and a select fraction of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>they are available for me in Germany</p>
<p>Really? Well, not up north where I am.</p>
<p>How about the Nexus 7?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not being neglected it takes time to hammer internation trading deals and different laws etc.</p>
<p>do you think itunes was available to the world market right out of the gate, it took time.</p>
<p>It has Spotify. Who cares about any other music ecosystem?</p>
<p>iTunes is a legacy app at this point.</p>
<p>Eh, what? iTunes houses all my movies, music, books and tv shows I <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong> purchase through the iTunes Store. It&#8217;s also receiving a pretty big update this month and feeds all it&#8217;s content to the other Macs in the house and our living room Apple TV.</p>
<p>No, it is not a legacy app.</p>
<p>Wow, that sounds like Dropbox, only less useful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to house 2 TB of content in Dropbox folders. That also doesn&#8217;t retain and show the kind of meta data en layout I have set up and certainly doesn&#8217;t make finding, playing and streaming to&#8230; as easy as it is now.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s &#8220;cool&#8221; to hate iTunes nowadays, but try looking at it subjectively.</p>
<p>I really like Dropbox, and am a fairly heavy user of it (20 GB of space), but it&#8217;s not going to provide me with this:<br />
<img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3L1C3j1G2q2t0y3T262G/iTunes.png" /></p>
<p>I see your point; I was too quick and gave the wrong example. My point is there&#8217;s plenty of software that can do what iTunes does, without locking you to one company (many prefer a NAS server for hosting their media, for example).</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8221;, that must be a unique Android tablet offering :p</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really trust the Verge reviewers to properly judge whether the OS is fluid. Like this:</p>
<blockquote>the Jelly Bean upgrade didn&#8217;t solve the performance, lag, and stuttering issues that are all too endemic to Android. The Infinity still lags a bit when launching or closing apps, and scrolling in the browser is still pretty clunky.</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t own any Apple devices, so when I used an iPad a few weeks back, I didn&#8217;t have any prior experience. I was waiting to see the supposedly &#8220;buttery smooth&#8221; scrolling, but the minute I opened a web page in Mobile Safari and tried to scroll, it started stuttering.</p>
<p>IMO, the Transformer Pad Infinity is the best tablet on the market right now, and I haven&#8217;t had any ecosystem issues with my Transformer Prime. I&#8217;ve got tablet apps for everything that I need.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny you say &#8220;buttery smooth&#8221;, because that&#8217;s what Fandroids used as the selling point of ICS. But now that JB is out, they&#8217;ve changed their mind and use the same term for JB as though ICS wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>apple is the perfect ecosystem for ineffective sheep</p>
<p>Not surprised that JB didn&#8217;t remove all of the system&#8217;s lag.  It&#8217;s still present in my Nexus 7.  :(</p>
<p>One more thing, the Netflix lag is horrible on all devices since they overhauled the app a few weeks ago.  People, including myself, are up in arms about the abysmal performance of the UI.</p>
<p>I read some of those reviews and have been avoiding updating Netflix for that reason</p>
<p>Netflix UI, stability, and lag have always been terrible. At least from an iPad 1 owner&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s a whole new world of suck.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been fine on my Galaxy tab the few times I&#8217;ve used it.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s even the case on my wife&#8217;s iPad as well.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because Netflix uses a web UI for all their apps (Android, iOS, etc). The entire interface is basically a bloated, heavily JS-laden website with poor hardware acceleration. It makes it easier for them to manage and port to new systems and devices, but has the severe downside of slowdown.</p>
<p>It really is disturbing that 2.5 years in on Netflix for iOS and we still don&#8217;t even have a native iPad app, let alone a native Android or WP app.  After all the price hiking you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d be able to afford a few real developers.</p>
<p>2 minutes with the UI, 2 hours watching. What lag?</p>
<p>Hardware does all of the heavy lifting for them on the audio.  All they have to do is use h.264 (which they have done since the beginning) and they&#8217;re set.  Why is a decent UI so much to ask for?</p>
<p>You should ask Netflix. It doesn&#8217;t affect my opinion about the Transformer though.</p>
<p>I thought that was the key feature of jelly bean</p>
<p>It made it loads better, but it didn&#8217;t remove all lag.  There&#8217;s still some lag within apps.</p>
<p>No OS upgrade can ever remove lag from bad apps.</p>
<p>And to be fair, some iPad apps lag as well. The issue here is the lag opening, switching, closing apps, which is then entirely on the OS&#8217;s ability to manage system resources.</p>
<p>This is something I don&#8217;t really have trouble with on my Nexus devices on JB.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have trouble with it even on my rooted KF as long as I have enough free RAM.  Maybe it&#8217;s the Transformer&#8217;s stock ROM?</p>
<p>statments like that will get you banned on the Verge.  Can not distrupt the reality distortion field that everything in iOS is always perfect and always smooth.</p>
<p>Ha, the irony.</p>
<p>As an iPad (3) user I can confirm this is still an issue, occasionally. Unsurprisingly so, considering the screen, but an issue nonetheless. Apple has nailed it with the iPhone 5, but they still have a way to go with their two other &#8216;Retina&#8217; devices.</p>
<p>maybe is just app specific&#8230;</p>
<p>Not even Jellybean can get around the shitty I/O controllers Asus put in the Transformer Pad/Prime/Infinity (which is the reason for a lot of the lagging).</p>
<p>My old TFP was a dog compared to my Nexus 7.</p>
<p>And yet my friend&#8217;s Transformer Prime received an update to 4.1 and demonstrates none of these lagging issues. The notification bar opens instantly and he&#8217;s really happy with it.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder what the issue is. I know Asus doesn&#8217;t do much customization, but perhaps what customization it does is causing conflicts?</p>
<p>As soon as I did anything I/O intensive on my TF Prime it was lock up city for me (and others from reports on various forums).</p>
<p>The rest of the tablet was superb but the issues I was having with it (partially fixed by unlocking, thus voiding my warranty combined with some<a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android/potential-io-bottleneck-fix-for-the-transformer-prime/" target="new"> custom ROM hackery</a>) got it into a fairly useful state but it still fell short of the £500 I&#8217;d laid down on the thing.</p>
<p>I eventually sold it and got my Nexus 7 and am far more impressed with the lower-specced device that doesn&#8217;t lock up at all.</p>
<p>This is quite true.  There&#8217;s a great hack in the XDA forums now that uses that data2SD hack to move pretty much everything from the internal memory to an ultra fast microSD card.  Tests and such show that it greatly improves system performance!  It seems Asus had to cheap out somewhere while making the prime, and the internal flash memory was one of those things.  Still though, I&#8217;v got 4.1 on my prime, and this is still my primary computer.  My wife uses the laptop.  I do everything on this thing.  :)</p>
<p>This could be it.</p>
<p>Crap I/O? Seriously? I thought we buried that one with the Galaxy S &#8211; it originally used a slow-ass MoviNAND chip for the /data partition and internal storage, but Samsung saw the error of their ways and switched to a faster OneNAND chip since Dec 2010. Don&#8217;t tell me manufacturers haven&#8217;t learned from that mistake &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Asus may not have&#8230;</p>
<p>Once I started filling it up with apps the lag returned. :(</p>
<p>I said this before and I&#8217;m to keep on saying it over, and over again:</p>
<p><strong>Tegra3 is the problem!</strong></p>
<p>That stupid &#8220;ninja&#8221; core keeps kicking in, which isn&#8217;t powerful enough for major UI tasks, and that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll always get that lag. Unless there&#8217;s a concrete way to freakin&#8217; disable that core, you&#8217;ll ALWAYS have that lag. At best, Asus (or any other OEM using Tegra3) may attempt to do lots of optimizations to minimize the effects.</p>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be a problem with an Exynos 4 or Snapdragon S4 based device running a light-skinned/stock version of Jelly Bean (like the one Asus is using), the UI would literally FLY. nVidia either needs to fix that with Tegra4 or throw the whole &#8220;ninja&#8221; core thing out and adopt big.LITTLE which should be a MUCH more reliable method of achieving the same thing.</p>
<p>If you believe that there is no lag on the new iPad, you are delusional. There is no remedy to badly written apps.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad that I&#8217;d pick a Windows RT tablet over an Android one given the age of Android tabs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true&#8230; I&#8217;m actually much more inclined to purchase the Surface RT, an unpriced, unreleased, unreviewed tablet than an Android, just on the basis that it has more potential at this point. Also, MS office.</p>
<p>so now, android tablets with keyboards vs chromebooks, the overlap here really makes me wonder what google is doing. Also, whats that triangular thing on your desk? looks like a music timekeeper</p>
<p>Looks more like a speaker than a metronome.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a metronome.  It&#8217;s got a cover on it.  Had one of those as a kid.</p>
<p>I think Chromebook was an interesting idea that was worth pursuing, but seeing how Android has developed, it just looks like the ugly step sister now.</p>
<p>Speaking from experience, Chrome OS is awesome.  And as good as Chrome for Android is, it doesn&#8217;t measure up to the full monty.</p>
<p>Chrome OS is for the unadulterated web, encryption and security features at the hardware level, and hassle free maintenance (i.e. auto-updating).  It&#8217;s ahead of its time but its time is coming.</p>
<p>Seeing the kind of code that goes into Chrome I tend to agree. We do not see it yet in the current release version of Chrome &#8211; but if you run Canary and can see all the new application APIs &#8211; it is clear that Google has a very good idea of where ChromeOS is going &#8211; and it is going to be a great developer platform &#8211; much more so than Android (I write Apps for both). Heck, you can now write a web server in the browser in Chrome &#8211; with the new networking API. It&#8217;s a crazy new world out there and people are not aware of it &#8211; but Chrome has some really well thought about design specifications below the hood.</p>
<p>Now they just need to take the next obvious step and get touch into it as a native first degree paradigm, because Chrome lags in touch support compared to, say, Internet Explorer 10 which is really fantastic.</p>
<p>In that case, I look forward to seeing how it develops.</p>
<p>Did you really installed 3rd-party crappy apps like the official Twitter app while doing the review?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t expect any device with an &#8220;open&#8221; operating system not to lag with crappy apps installed!</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>The OS itself is probably really smooth (just navigate the launcher and settings a few times), but if you&#8217;re testing it with outdated apps that don&#8217;t even use the Holo interface (and therefore probably not hardware accelerated) of course you&#8217;re going to come across some lag.</p>
<p>If you watch the video he also demonstrates lag while using what appears to be Chrome and the OS itself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found Chrome to be quite laggy sometimes, even on JB. I much prefer the stock browser for this reason.</p>
<p>Agreed. Chrome is still in beta in my opinion</p>
<p>Agreed. Chrome really has issues where it hangs randomly.</p>
<p>I wonder how the stock browser was in comparison&#8230;</p>
<p>Agreed. Stock browser on my TF700 is far superior to Chrome.</p>
<p>Yep. The stock browser is much better. Even if Chrome was miles faster, I wouldn&#8217;t switch to it since it lacks the stock browser&#8217;s awesome quick controls.</p>
<p>Chrome is really bad on Android ATM. Makes my Nexus S unusable.</p>
<p>What do you mean &#8216;really installed&#8217;?</p>
<p>Twitter is a massively popular service, and having a crappy application is inexcusable.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t Google&#8217;s fault if Twitter&#8217;s app sucks.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t realize Google was the one making all the 3rd party apps in their store.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Fuck, read your post wrong, sorry lol.</p>
<p>But its Andy Rubin&#8217;s fault , when he said that he doesn&#8217;t believe in tablet specific apps back in 2011 (and lot of people actually got shocked)</p>
<p>it&#8217;s get&#8217;s really frustrating around here at times.  David Pierce has no business do this review.</p>
<p>they have Apple enthusiats hired here why can&#8217;t they hire some Anroid experts.    why can&#8217;t they poach like Droid Life or Android Police or something like that.</p>
<p>You full of it! Lol therefore us Windows Phone fans ought not to have Mr. Joshua Topolsky review our flagship WP handsets right?  Just stop and accept their honest opinions like you say to us. It&#8217;s not perfect and the reviewers tell it like it is so it can improve. #GoldenRule</p>
<p>honestly you shouldn&#8217;t.   I like Josh but when it comes to Windows he&#8217;s not the best person to review their devices.    I think he really likes Android phones  and iOS  but Windows I think he&#8217;ll have to do alot of tongue biting .</p>
<p>I also would LOVE if the Verge hired soem Window&#8217;s enthusist&#8217;s as well.  Would love to see a laptop review coming from someone other than Mac users.</p>
<p>So reviews should be sugar coated with fanboy love to make us geeks feel better about our purchases? Me personally I want a die hard review that doesn&#8217;t it corners. This way if a company like MS actually does do something great and josh says it then I know it will be really great.</p>
<p>No not sugar coated but done by people who truely know the platform and the OS.    go around any dedicated Android site and they are by no means a bunch of yes men.</p>
<p>If you use a mac as you daily computer and that &#8216;s all you use,  but your job is to review a windows laptop.   And you get like a week with it , you won&#8217;t know all the ins and outs.</p>
<p>you have a Windows user who know knows the OS you can get a much more educated review.  Someone who is not reviewing it through the lens of a Mac user.</p>
<p>Same here, it&#8217;s pretty clear David Pierce doesn&#8217;t know the Android tablet platfor up and down, what apps are available, and all it&#8217;s other uses.  No mention of DLNA, no mention of HDMI, no mention of customiztion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s written as  if the UI isn&#8217;t trying to emulate iOS then it&#8217;s a fail.</p>
<p>Jomamm&#8217;s point is clear and understandable to me. That&#8217;s why I like anandtech reviews as they are more in depth with a more technical approach.</p>
<p>Man, you&#8217;re impossibly annoying.</p>
<p>David has probably reviewed 20 Android devices in the past 6 months.  He knows the platform in and out and unlike the reviewers at Droid-Life or Android Police he knows the completing platforms in and out.  Just because his opinions don&#8217;t match up with yours does not make him wrong.</p>
<p>but if you review it through the same lens, it&#8217;s still repeating the same mentality.</p>
<p>If he owns one and uses it on a daily basis then you might have apoint.  but reviewing a tablet for a week, running the same exact tests on it.     I can answer  the question 4 +4 = 9       60 times doesn&#8217;t mean that I know math.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s reviewing each android tablet through the same lens.   Just his remark about how many tablet apps are available proves my point.</p>
<p>Yeah cause it definately couldn&#8217;t be the tablet and OS is horrible it has to be the reviewer? /sarcasm. Did you watch the video and how bad it lags? I can tell you exactly what it is cause I owned the Prime and Xoom. It is android plus ASUS taking the same approach with this tablet as they did their low res tablets was a huge mistake. It took apple redoing an entire cheap and fine tuning it to push the 4x pixels. It clearly isn&#8217;t as easy as companies think and cutting corners just won&#8217;t work. Not to mention the terra 3 chip is old and sluggish. Even on my Nexus 7 it chugs at times with a lower res display.</p>
<p>first off  he actually said quite the opposite about the OS and the tablet being &#8220;horrible&#8221;  9&#8217;s and 8&#8217;s is what I read.</p>
<p>my beef with him is not know what apps are out there.</p>
<p>Wait so&#8230;lemme get this straight out of the box the device is fast. But when you install bad 3rd party apps, instead of having a slow 3rd party experience they slow down the whole system? <br />
If this is still the case with android (haven&#8217;t owned an android phone since 2.2 in 2010), then this reflects just as much on the OS as the bad apps.</p>
<p>I have a feeling the lag may be due to him having the performance setting on &#8220;balanced,&#8221; instead of &#8220;performance,&#8221; which you can see in the video.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;crappy apps&#8221; it clearly lagged horribly when opening the notification drawer. It was hard to watch. I can&#8217;t believe I used to deal with that on my Xoom and Prime. Good riddence. Even my Nexus 7 lags horribly when compared to my retina ipad. I used it for a couple weeks and use it for reading but I think I&#8217;m going to sell it. Clearly android is in some trouble on the tablet front.</p>
<p>Great review.  It seems price is the big (if not biggest factor) when trying to compete with the iPad, especially when you can get an iPad 2 starting at 399.  Also, the review  doesn&#8217;t mention storage space, which would help in factoring cost comparisons to the iPad.</p>
<p>I was waiting for someone to mention that. You&#8217;re getting double the storage of an iPad at the same price point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m beginning to think that Android&#8217;s plaguing performance issues are due to resolution, not sheer horsepower. Could the OS have some kind of hangup related to higher res displays?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that the GPU isn&#8217;t all that well-suited to powering a 1920&#215;1200 display. That&#8217;s a lot more pixels than the 1366&#215;768 displays we see on most non-iPad tablets. That&#8217;s also likely why no Windows RT tablets have been introduced with 1080p+ displays.</p>
<p>Snapdragon S4 Pro should have no issue at that resolution. And the 5xxx series Exynos.</p>
<p>This is quite likely to be the reason; a composited UI at high resolution takes a hefty GPU and decent memory bandwidth. High-clocked Tegra 3s like this are competitive GPU-wise with the Apple A5, but not with the A5X, which is used in the iPad 3 and is twice as fast. The A5X, very unusually, also has a 128bit memory bus; most high-end SoCs (including the A5 and probably the A6) have a 64bit bus, and the Tegra 3 has a 32bit one.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no off-the-shelf part for OEMs to use which can match the A5X on GPU performance, though the S4 Pro should when it&#8217;s available; there are also no off-the-shelf parts which can match it on memory bandwidth. This will probably change over the next year.</p>
<p>My Atrix HD works pretty well with HDMI out to my monitor&#8230; Meaning its powering a 1080p 25&quot; screen and a 720p 4.5&quot; screen. <br />
But that&#8217;s with a Qualcomm S4, not a Tegra -might be the GPU is more optimized for HD. <br />
Also, it does lag sometimes, but always as a result of 3rd party apps, or trying to take 60fps video&#8230; Something it can do(rather amazing for a phone, imho), but which caused it to almost completely crash, and stop responding to input. I did stupidly havE a bunch of other apps open when I tried, though.</p>
<p>My though is the fact the OS is running a java UI that introduces more lag than one would find from a native OS.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me what tablet apps (that actually matter) ios has that android doesn&#8217;t. Im confused as to why this is an issue at all.</p>
<p>GarageBand is superb on my iPad. My Nexus 7 has nothing that can compete.</p>
<p>GarageBand makes me wish I was a musician. Being a visual artist, Adobe Ideas is what does it for me. And both these apps run great on an &#8216;old&#8217; iPad 1.</p>
<p>and how many times do you use Garageband  after the initiall &#8220;Wow this is fun,&#8221;  off to the proverbial cybet attic it goes.  trust me my friends have the iPad and of course they use it about as much as they use the Wii.</p>
<p>Now on Android tablet  Gmail is suberb on my tablet  and trust me  the iPad has nothing that can compete with it.   the Gmail app on iOS is a POS.   So I&#8217;ll take something that is much more useful on a daily basis than a neat parlor trick any day.</p>
<p>So what does your Android Gmail app do that the iPad one doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>My dughter and I use GarageBand regularly. It&#8217;s a great tool for simple music compilation for the pair of us and fun to just make shit up together on.</p>
<p>Obviously its less likely my children would get into GMail on my Nexus 7 but the 2 apps have completely different usage scenarios so it&#8217;s a tad flawed to compare the two IMO.</p>
<p>GMail on Android is superb tho. I can&#8217;t stand the way the mail app handles adding attachments on iOS.</p>
<p>Pages running on the iPad is a dream. Numbers, iMovie, Twitter (old version), cooking apps, Facebook, + tons of games that use the space better than the iPhone version. The list is really huge.</p>
<p>Most of these are apples apps so of course there not on android . google has an equivalent to all of them that are all tablet optimized. so moot point. All games in android scale up very well with little to no work from developers. and facebook&#8230; well yeah the facebook app just sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Real</strong> Google Maps, GMail, and Chrome trump all of those.  So what if the list is huge if it&#8217;s irrelevant.</p>
<p>But Chrome is available on the iPad&#8230; And technically GMail is too, even if the app is shit.</p>
<p>Umm. We have chrome on the iPad.<br />
That said, why do u assume we need chrome and gmail for a tablet to be good? Are u assuming everyone needs google services? No. Does apple mail app do general email well? Yes. Is Safari a brilliant browser? Yes.</p>
<p>Does android have a powerful app like iPhoto or iMovie? No.<br />
 Does it have the wide range of cooking, kids apps like iPad has? No</p>
<p>adobePhotosshop touch for Android tablets  and iMovie, really?   Please stop naming apps nobody uses.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use the apps. Hence no one uses the apps &#8211; Bind fandroid.</p>
<p>Kindly go read an article verge posted about a music composer who entirely used an iPad to make music for his new album</p>
<p>so one person who nobody will ever hear of is the new rule.   I know of no serious musican who would use the iPad as the music source.</p>
<p>Umm.  Faux Chrome that is required to use the Safari rendering engine due to iOS restraints is not truly Chrome.</p>
<p>Umm, chrome browsers selling point on ios is not its speed, but chrome sync with your google account if you want. I don&#8217;t use it, but I know that&#8217;s the draw</p>
<p>How convenient.  You pick and choose the features that Google are able to support on iOS as the &#8220;draw&#8221; while down playing the rest.</p>
<p>Just stop.</p>
<p>how&#8217;s that any different then all the iPHans screaming  Garage band  Garage Band</p>
<blockquote>Does android have a powerful app like iPhoto or iMovie? No.</blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used any movie editing apps, but there is a ton of excellent alternatives to iPhoto.</p>
<blockquote>Does it have the wide range of cooking, kids apps like iPad has? No</blockquote>
<p>Kids apps &#8211; yes.(Have practical experience iPad vs N7) Not as many as iPad, but a substantial number that you don&#8217;t have to worry. Same goes for cooking apps.</p>
<p>But even then, I  would still recommend iPad</p>
<p>What&#8217;s up with the whole &#8220;You don&#8217;t have Chrome or Gmail, so you suck&#8221;. Some of use <strong>gasp</strong> a different browser and email provider! Google Maps <strong>is</strong> one of Android&#8217;s strengths, yes, but you&#8217;re completely ignoring the useful apps that are lacking on Android he noted. :/</p>
<p>Pages and Numbers are a pain to use on the ipad. I have to use one for work to inventory, numbers drives me bonkers with how user unfriendly it is.</p>
<p>Twitter, Facebook, Alien Blue, Infinity Blade, Tweetbot, Color, Scribblenauts,<br />
Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, Lemur, Touchable, iMovie, iPhoto, Looptastic, etc.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t bother. According to android fans,  we ipad users can&#8217;t use gmail and not having chrome is a negative point</p>
<p>Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?<br />

<p>I&#8217;d respond to the apps question by showing my two tablets&#8217; homescreens. The iPad2 is packed with folders of apps that we use regularly. The Sony Tablet S has a sparse handful of basically just reading and movie apps along with the normal bloatware, and I still can&#8217;t get it to play 720 MKV&#8217;s without stuttering. I handed the iPad2 to the wife because I knew the Sony would end up being basically useless to her.</p>
<p>Sorry, but with Windows 8 upon us I just honestly cannot imagine why anyone would want an Android tablet anymore unless it&#8217;s a cheapy 7 incher, and even then its value is somewhat questionable.</p>
<p>I say this, by the way, as an Android tablet owner.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with android tablet is the tablet ecosystem, and you are saying windows 8 is better even if it has the worst ecosystem. That doesn&#8217;t make sense</p>
<p>There&#8217;s huge difference between Windows 8 and Windows 8 RT.  Using an Intel based tablet you&#8217;d have the whole of all PC apps ever, even though most aren&#8217;t designed specifically for touchscreen use.  Most programs will work though.</p>
<p>the difference is Android had its opportunity to build an ecosystem and failed. MS hasn&#8217;t failed yet with Windows 8.</p>
<p><strong>sigh</strong>  the whole lack of tablet apps mantra is becoming increasing annoying.   I really wished the Verge hired someone who really knows the Android tablet ecosyste.</p>
<p>You get guys like David Pierce who look at only the  &#8220;Staff Picks for Tablets&#8221; and things that&#8217;s all the apps  and these are the so called experts.</p>
<p>on my Tablet which is the orignal Asus tablet  here are some of the tablet optimized apps.    All the major ones are there exept Facebook, which should be announced soon and twitter,    and really twitter, who cares.</p>
<p>but anywho  these are the tablet optimized apps.</p>

<p>Josh  please  PLEASE  for the love of God hire someone who knows Android in and out through and through beyond the phones.  Please hire someone who knows the tablets,   the mod&#8217;s etc</p>
<p>It&#8217;s soo frustrating reading someone like David who has no clue how many apps are available that are optimized for it.</p>
<p>I just want to say that the TED app is probably one of the best made apps on the platform.</p>
<p>So your 30 apps prove nothing. iOS has way more tablet optimized apps than Android at this point. At least thats what I heard on every tech-news outlet that ever compared the two ecosystems. Are they all false?</p>
<p>My earlier point still stands, what Useful apps are there that are optimized for ios and are not for android. Can anyone give me an example?&#8230;. and Garage band doesn&#8217;t count a &#8220;useful app&#8221;</p>
<p>Why should people even try to convince you of this? I think you live in denial if you can&#8217;t see that there are more tablet optimized apps for iOS out there. The solution is not to deny this, but  to hope that developers improve the situation. Google is well aware of this problem and is helping developers out with great guide lines etc.</p>
<p>What problem i would reather have 10 tablet apps that matter on a tablet than 10,000 phone apps to use on a giant screen for no reason at all.</p>
<p>Well, if that is good enough for you then I am happy for you.</p>
<p>iPad has 250,000 iPad specific apps. Go troll somewhere else</p>
<p>They are not iPad specific, just recompiled and put back in the store again so they can be sold on a tablet as well.</p>
<p>Android does that for every app, so there are up to 675.000 tablet apps for Android.</p>
<p>what denial,  it&#8217;s either you have the main popular Tablet optimized apps or you don&#8217;t and Android does.</p>
<p>Facebook &amp; Twitter first party apps.</p>
<p>no first party apps are apps developed in house,  in this case Google.  Gmail would be an example of a first party app.</p>
<p>and Garage band would be an example of a first part app for Apple.</p>
<p>you might be mistake a 3rdparty app to a 3rd party apps such as tweetdeck for Twitter.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few I use on my iPad that you either don&#8217;t have on Android or you just have a phone UI: Twitter, Facebook, Alien Blue, Infinity Blade, Tweetbot, Color, Scribblenauts,<br />
 Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, Lemur, Touchable, iMovie, iPhoto, Looptastic, Sparrow, Clear, Goodreader, Noteability, Flipboard, Chase Mobile</p>
<p>Good list, but I don&#8217;t believe Sparrow &amp; Clear are iPad optimized.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right but those apps don&#8217;t exist on Android in any form tablet or not. (not that it matters with Sparrow since Android has the native gmail app)</p>
<p>I can list Google first party apps just as easy as you can list  any of the iList.  And I sure I can go through the Tiegra Zone and pick out games that aren&#8217;t available on the iPad.   and Chse only means something if you have a chase account.</p>
<p>but my point wasn&#8217;t to go app for app, my point was many major apps are on and are optimized for Android tablets.   It&#8217;s not nearly as dire as David makes out to be.</p>
<p>it just isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>and oh  you can actually download Flipboard through the Amazon app store and it scales quite nicely.</p>
<p>also the verge is a phone only apps on both.  Now check out how it looks on an iPad and check out ohow it looks on an Android tablet.</p>
<p>Flipboard for Android is shit and is comically scaled on anything larger than a Nexus 7. If you took the time to truly evaluate the iPad rather than go into it thinking it&#8217;s a gimmick you&#8217;d see how utterly ignorant you are. The Android tablet experience is sophomoric compared to the iPad and anyone who has extensively used both platforms would say the same as you can see from the countless responses to your posts that say similar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never said Flipboard on the iPad is a gimmick, can you point that out?</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t try to prove you wrong, I was just flipping through my homescreen looking at my apps and seeing which ones I would have to go without if I wanted to switch to an Android tablet.  Right now that list is too long for me to have any desire to switch.</p>
<p>Difference being, all google apps except maps are on iOS.</p>
<p>And Why do u assume people need gmail and chrome? They aren&#8217;t the only email services in the world</p>
<p>difference between a skelton type of app that is a 3rd party app as opposed to the native offering it has on Android  and the intergration of the google services apps across your computer etc.      Having all your android contacts etc intergrated in your Gmail and that being your hub is quite the difference experience than what you get having it on iOS.</p>
<p>But why do I need google contacts? I can very well use Microsoft exchange and iCloud for these so called services.  U keep talking as though they are a must.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s clear u don&#8217;t know jack squat about iOS. iOS easily syncs google contacts, calendar and mail. Effortlessly. Chrome on iPad also syncs up with chrome on my laptop. But then again I don&#8217;t use chrome but if I want chrome syncing I can get it.</p>
<p>Try again. U r woefully ignorant on what google provides for iOS. And u also assume everyone needs google services when u don&#8217;t really</p>
<p>because they are superior sevices that&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>No. They&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>Yes.  They are.</p>
<p>I just said they are the ones I own,  I sure there are a ton more.  My point is all the major apps are there but yet are constanlty overlookd.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying the app library is as large as the iPads, I&#8217;m pointing out it&#8217;s no where as bleak as these tech writers make them out to be.</p>
<p>and plus they also always overlook how intregrated all the Google first part apps are with your computer, your phone and your Tablet  which reminds I forgot to put in Google +.</p>
<p>Have you even used an iPad?</p>
<p>my wife owns the iPad 3  .  have you ever used a high end android tablet?   Something tells me no.</p>
<p>I have used &#8220;high end&#8221; android tablets. But, what is a &#8220;high end&#8221; android tablet? Is it based on price? specs? screen? size? We&#8217;re talking about software here, so are you saying that there is a difference in app selection between &#8220;high end&#8221; and &#8220;low end&#8221; tablets? We both know that they are the same.</p>
<p>No one ever doubts Android&#8217;s lack of apps. They&#8217;re almost catching up to Apple, and Android also has several other App markets. What we doubt is Android&#8217;s lack of <strong>quality</strong> apps. Your list up there and the points you&#8217;ve been making against the tablet app selection on iOS made me think I was right. I guess I&#8217;m wrong. Sorry.</p>
<p>I would classify high end android tablets as the ones running Tiegra 2 and 3  from the likes of Sony, Asus, Samsung, Motorola and ever Toshiba etc.  but especially Sony, Asus and Samsung.</p>
<p>Many will pick up the  Kohls or Bed Bath and BEyond Android tablets and then give a blanket statement that they are crap heck even the Lenovo, which makes high end laptops, makes a so so mid range tablet.</p>
<p>So now you&#8217;re talking specs and not software. Did you even read what I just wrote?</p>
<p>well normally specs and software will follow.   For example you won&#8217;t find Samsung releasing the Note or the Tab running  2.3.    They are running 4.0 and now are starting to run 4.1.</p>
<p>high specs with software go hand and hand.</p>
<p>Apps&#8230;</p>
<p>Facepalm.</p>
<p>like which ones?  which apps that are your daily drive besides Facebook and twitter, I will concede those two, but which apps that you use on regular basis ?</p>
<p>just rolling my eyes</p>
<p>I have a lot, and I&#8217;ll just bore you. Like over 120.</p>
<p>When will you realize that it&#8217;s not about you or me. Up there, you listed quite a few apps from big companies. Why disregard the smaller developers. Indie gaming is one of the prime examples of why iOS&#8217;s app selection kills Android&#8217;s. You should go look at the app store more often on your wife&#8217;s iPad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about having a 120.   I  have 80 apps on my Asus tablet and can have 50 tablet optimized apps if I so choosee.  whoop teee doooo.</p>
<p>My point is what daily/weekly apps do you use .  for example on a daily basis  I use</p>
<p>Gmail<br />
Calender<br />
Chrome<br />
Nook<br />
USA Today<br />
ImDb<br />
Flixsters<br />
HBO Go<br />
YouTube<br />
TMZ<br />
Google Books<br />
my Bank app<br />
NetFlix<br />
Engadget<br />
The Verge (scaled up)</p>
<p>These are daily  and weekly drives.    So saying Garage Band or photo booth is non sense those are fun apps for sure, but by no means deal breakers.</p>
<p>So what apps are really truely missing.    almost everyone I know who owns an iPad  use it to play angry birds type of games,  web browsing,  and email and the top uses.</p>
<p>and besides watching movies on the iPad stinks, it really does.   that 4:3 aspect ratio is just plain horrible for movies but of course that is almost always overlooked and apple gets a free pass with that.</p>
<p>&gt; iOS has way more tablet optimized apps than Android at this point. At least thats what I heard on every tech-news outlet that ever compared the two ecosystems. Are they all false?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got an iPad 1 as well as a Nexus 7 and Asus Transformer. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, there&#8217;s absolutely no question that the iPad has the better selection of tablet apps. It&#8217;s not even close. And anyone suggesting otherwise is probably being less than honest.</p>
<p>A more appropriate argument would be the ever popular, &#8220;Who needs apps? Just the use the website&#8221; or my personal favorite, &#8220;Android apps scale better than on iOS, so the lack of tablet apps isn&#8217;t a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both of those arguments, as apologetic as they might be, are at least rooted in half-truths.</p>
<p>By that definition, iPhone should get docked for having a smaller ecosystem than Android. Both have roughly 700&#8217;000 apps in their respective stores, where App Store has 200&#8217;000 iPad exclusive apps and android has about 60&#8217;000 tablet only apps.  That is a whole 140&#8217;000 more apps for Android phones than iPhone.</p>
<p>no I don&#8217;t think so &#8211; do you have a source for these numbers?</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s I/O and Apple&#8217;s last earnings call + app trends.<br />
And then a bit of mathematics.</p>
<p>besides the fact that you didn&#8217;t provide any sources &#8211; are you sure they said that the 60k are in addition to the 700k?</p>
<p>Instagram is not a tablet app. Why mention it? Don&#8217;t make me check the rest.. but I will if i have to prove you a liar</p>
<p>Instagram really?! cause i really wanna use that on my tablet&#8230; Maybe im just not hipster enough</p>
<p>Good luck trying to fit a tablet in those skinny jeans.</p>
<p>@btoope&#8217;s oh really?   why don&#8217;t you just google Instagram for Android tablets<br />
here is one article</p>
<p><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/04/06/instagram-android-tablet/" target="_blank">http://venturebeat.com/2012/04/06/instagram-android-tablet/</a></p>
<p>but I&#8217;m sure you can find alot more.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t chime in if you don&#8217;t know the platform.</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>Oh I see, you&#8217;d like the Verge to hire someone that has the same favourite apps that you do. Hate to say it, but peoples opinions of which apps are important aren&#8217;t always the same.</p>
<p>No, just be informed of the platform.   So you can do an actual well rounded review.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really a pretty sad list.  Yes, the official Google apps are optimized, as are certain games.  Woo?</p>
<p>Where are big services like Twitter and Facebook?  Where is Flipboard?  Where is Zite? (okay, maybe I&#8217;m the only one who uses that one)  Where are steaming radio apps?</p>
<p>I have Facebook and a radio streaming app on my Infinity, and they&#8217;re both tablet optimized apps. I don&#8217;t use Twitter, Zite or Flipboard.</p>
<p>actually Facebook isn&#8217;t tablet optimized yet,  that shold be on the way. it&#8217;s web page works great  I have that bookmarked   but yeha what silellak doesn&#8217;t grasp that streaming apps even if they arent&#8217; offically optimized not only still work well, some like Pandora actually take advantage of the screen real estate and Android&#8217;s scaling ability.   Pandora scales almost perfectly on tablets.</p>
<p>If an app has solid landscape support they do scale extremely nice on Android Tablets.</p>
<p>so was the iPad useless before the the official Twitter and Facebook app came out.<br />
there&#8217;s pandora</p>
<p>and also if you took the time to read my post I said these were only MY apps not the only ones available for android tablets</p>
<p>where&#8217;s Lilly Pad for the iPad?   and oh a native Facebook app will be out, so what then what other single app are you guys going to hold your hat on</p>
<p>and yes I did list Google&#8217;s first party apps.  It&#8217;s an absolute total double standard.  Apple gets praise for it&#8217;s intergration through it&#8217;s first part apps when half of them are useless parlor tricks that are fun for a month such as Photobooth and Garageband.  but there is never a mention of the intergration of Google&#8217;s first part apps and how they perform  such as Gmail,  Gtalk ,   Google Maps and all the other google services.  You know those apps that are actually useful on a daily basis.</p>
<p>but why let that stand in the way of &#8220;hey look I can play the drums on my iPad.&#8221;</p>
<p>You act like I <em>want </em>Android to have a crappy 10-inch tablet experience.  I use an Android phone, because I think Android is a better <em>phone</em> OS &#8211; it&#8217;s just not a yet better <em>tablet </em>OS. What I <em>want</em> is for Android to be competitive in the 10-inch tablet market, but I&#8217;m not going to pretend things are good when they aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Why would anyone mention Google Maps or Google Navigation on a tablet?  Again, maybe you use your tablet differently than me, but I almost never use Maps or Navigation on my tablet.  That&#8217;s what my <em>phone </em>is for.  You can mock things like Garageband all you want &#8211; I don&#8217;t use it, so I don&#8217;t care &#8211; but it sure seems like lots of people have found a use for it.</p>
<p>but the whole point of my post was the lack of apps is no where as bleak as tech writers make them out.  And part of the problem besides having a non anroid users review the unit, is Google in it&#8217;s part.    They don&#8217;t have a separate tablet sections for apps.  The closest they have is &#8220;Staff Picks&#8221;  which is only a small portion of what&#8217;s available.<br />
Users who actually own an Android tablet on a day to day basis know there are so many more apps available due to either updates coming in that optimizes it,  third party app finders such as Tablified.com apps  and following android specific sites such as Android Community etc.</p>
<p>Sure I listed maps.   the screen size is makes using maps fantastic.   You can use maps just as you would on your PC  and I use it to also STAR places that I may be driving to so it will automatiically be STARRED on my phone when I&#8217;m ready to use it for my GPS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using a TouchPad since November. I kept it on webOS until January when ICS was ported.</p>
<p>I use the tablet for a few hours a day when I can pry it from my kids.</p>
<p>My usage is generally web browsing, XDA, Netflix, YouTube,  and movie files. I love it, couldn&#8217;t ask for more. So many of the phone apps scale great IMO.</p>
<p>On the other hand I played with an iPad the other day for the first time.  I don&#8217;t know if this has always been this way, but the YouTube app was just the phone app scaled (quite poorly) to kind of full screen. I don&#8217;t know if there used to be a decent YouTube app on iOS 5, but the experience immediately pointed out how different using a phone app is on Android. webOS did a similar thing with a lettetboxed phone. Android handles that scaling so much better, because its been built that way since day 1.</p>
<p>Because my phone is always in my pocket, I don&#8217;t Facebook or Twitter on a tablet. I also don&#8217;t do either on a desktop. So much of my use is consumption, and the Android platform supports that great.</p>
<p>I agree its harder to know in the play store what apps are tablet optimized, but feel it isn&#8217;t as big a deal as running a phone app on the iPad.</p>
<p>There are other iPad specific YouTube apps. Your experience is very limited to make a statement.</p>
<p>I meant there are 250,000 iPad apps!!&#8230;.and android can&#8217;t touch iOS when it comes to cooking and kids apps. Heck even some games.</p>
<p>Yeah my limited experience taught me I won&#8217;t pay $500 for a tablet, regardless of what OS it runs. $400 is still too much, $300 is a stretch and $200 is just right. Besides that I would not pay anything for an Apple product after their conduct in the courtroom. If I buy another tablet it will be the Kindle Fire or Nook, or Nexus 7.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need 250,000 apps, I only need 10-15.  What would you even do with a cooking app, I already have a shelf full of unused cookbooks. The kids have plenty of games on Android, and far more of them are free.</p>
<p>what do you mean by &#8220;other&#8221; YouTube apps.  there is only one.  and I&#8217;ve seen my wife&#8217;s YouTube apps on her iPad, it&#8217;s Ok and meh,  nothing like the Android tablet app.</p>
<blockquote>Where is Flipboard?</blockquote>
<p>Works well on a tablet?</p>
<p>As far as Facebook is concerned &#8211; where is Facebook on mobile at all?</p>
<p>Yep. Blame the reviewer.</p>
<p>But what are you going to say to the developer of said OS and when they think the tablet apps aren&#8217;t up to par?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3475074/google-tablet-app-guidelines-checklist" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3475074/google-tablet-app-guidelines-checklist</a></p>
<p>Really reaching there buddy. A lot of those apps aren&#8217;t actually optimized. Just scaled differently. Same exact application with a different resolution. Google Maps? Google Navigation? Lol&#8230; Please don&#8217;t compare Android&#8217;s 30 or so actually optimized apps to the iPad&#8217;s 250,000+</p>
<p>&#8220;You get guys like David Pierce who look at only the "Staff Picks for Tablets" and things that’s all the apps and these are the so called experts.&#8221;</p>
<p>What part of this review gave you any indication that this was the case?</p>
<p>The Verge should hire this guy. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee?feature=results_main" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee?feature=results_main</a></p>
<p>MKBHD! Oh yes please.</p>
<p>I agree.   Also  Lisa from Mobiletechreview.com   She has to be one of the most knowledgable,  most platform angnostic person I have ever come across on the net in the review world.      I hoenstly couldn&#8217;t tell you if she is a Mac or PC   android or iOS,  nook or kindle etc.</p>
<p>She is IMHO one the most trust worthy reviewers.</p>
<p>I also forgot to add &#8230;..  again these are all tablet optimized  for Android.</p>
<p>Zillow<br />

Adobe Photo Shop Touch<br />
PicSay Pro</p>
<p>but every iPhan is right there are no tablet optimized apps for Android</p>
<p>I take my Infinity everywhere I can, way more portable than a laptop and more functional than the iPad. I didn&#8217;t even have a laptop for a year, I used the first Asus Transformer and it worked well. I only have a laptop for home use really, even though it lasts 6 hours+, the infinity lasts all day. The Infinity beats the iPad in every way hardware wise, but of course people complain about software. It&#8217;s not that bad, you find ways around it. It&#8217;s the coolest device to show others because it&#8217;s a tablet and netbook almost, the dock is crazy awesome. People are like, woahhhh, what just happen? Did you break it? Naw. It&#8217;s my tablet. This was Asus is going is the best of both worlds. We&#8217;ll see how they do with Windows 8, but for now I&#8217;m very happy with mine. Windows 8 on my laptop/desktop still has too many bugs.</p>
<blockquote>App ecosystem lags iOS </blockquote>
<p>That there&#8217;s some A-grade trolling.</p>
<p>Trolling?  It is true that in the 10-inch tablet world, the Android ecosystem is far behind iOS.</p>
<p>OH, didn&#8217;t read it that way. When I looked at it, I read it to mean that there was lagging on the display, like we&#8217;ve seen in past versions of Android.</p>
<p>Still lags. Heavily improved? Yes. Equal to iOS? No</p>
<p>The Verge editors are soo biased, pure apple fanboys. This is way better than the iPad, I dont care about apps. I have keyboard, battery life, amazing screen, and everything awesome Android brings. With iPad im stuck with an oversized iphone OS</p>
<p>ZING!</p>
<p>You are not funny.</p>
<p>what a pointless comment, i&#8217;m not even a fan of the ipad.</p>
<p>Yous is even more pointess.</p>
<blockquote>With iPad im stuck with an oversized iphone OS</blockquote>
<p>Plus all the apps that come with the platform&#8230;..<br />
Apps extend the useage of my Galaxy Nexus, iPhone 4, Nexus 7 and iPad 2 massively. You shouldn&#8217;t really dismiss one of the bigger reasons people buy these gadgets.</p>
<p>also how are android tabs not an oversized android phone?</p>
<p>Especially considering that a lot of apps on an Android tablet is just that &#8230; an oversized version of the phone app. You know, the complaint that everyone has about Android tablets &#8211; including Google.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t reason with some people &#8230;</p>
<p>He was referring to the core OS not the apps. Android tablets have a different launcher design to make better use of widgets, settings and notifications. Of coarse ios doesn&#8217;t have widgets so there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>Yeah. Comparing my old GN vs my iPhone 5 and iPad vs my Nexus 7, the notification in Android is a lot better. I guess if I really cared about tweeting or posting on Facebook, the iOS notification system would be fine.</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t a huge user of widgets because I&#8217;m not a fan of clutter so that&#8217;s moot to me. What I did notice flip flopping back and forth is that there is a different between the quality of third party apps. There is no getting around it at the moment.</p>
<p>and you know this through experience or through  regurgatation.   I actually own an android tablet and find the opposite to be true.</p>
<p>Maybe our tablet usage differs, but for me, a tablet is basically an App Launcher&#8230;I honestly prefer Android to iOS in the phone world, but iOS to Android in the tablet world, and it&#8217;s almost entirely because of the iOS app ecosystem.  A great OS means little to me without apps that back it up &#8211; when I&#8217;m using a tablet, I&#8217;m almost always focused on one task at a time, and apps are ideal for that kind of workflow.</p>
<p>I was using one of these in the store the other day with the Jelly bean update. There was no issues with responsiveness.</p>
<p>Sounds like a better wrap up than David&#8217;s.  Thanks!</p>
<p>Yes cause David is God.</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s kind of a jerk, personally.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is that the quality of Asus tablets (from the original Transformer and onward) sucks big time: the have issues both with their design and build quality. Just Bing it &#8211; the enclosure gets gaps, the screen cracks when when the tablet is held &#8220;the wrong way&#8221;, everything bends and flexes, etc.</p>
<p>Just one example: <a href="http://www.transformerforums.com/forum/transformer-pad-infinity-help/26259-screen-crack.html" target="_blank">http://www.transformerforums.com/forum/transformer-pad-infinity-help/26259-screen-crack.html</a></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the flexing:<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fmjam.jpg" /></p>
<p>Just Bing it? Seriously? XD</p>
<p>Sorry, forgot the obligatory /s after the Bing part, bro.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s your problem.  Use Google instead.</p>
<p>Yeah, they will hide all the Android faults :)</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the review very short? And why there is no comparison of screen, battery life of this tablet with the New iPad?</p>
<p>&#8230;because this is The Verge, not Anandtech.</p>
<p>people get mad when you compare every tablet to iPad.  Then when they don&#8217;t people get mad.  its a lose/lose haha</p>
<p>All transformers to this point suffer from a memory bottleneck which is why you get the slowness.  Its why I would never recommend those tablets.  I assume since the nexus 7 is only 8 or 16 GB that the quality of the memory is better.  My prime would constantly show the &#8220;app is not responding&#8221; message for many apps.  The worse part is though that window do want show Until the app decides to finally responds so you just hit ignore.    These memory issues can not be fixed in software either people.  Search for Asus transformer io bottlenecks.</p>
<p><strong>David is The Verge&#8217;s review-machine!</strong></p>
<p>Yo DP, I love the Google Ecosystem, why isn&#8217;t that add as a Pro?.. Also,<br />
<blockquote>Dock is heavy, keyboard cramped</blockquote>  &#8230;Should not even be part of the Pro/Con&#8230;especially cause the tablet doesn&#8217;t come with a dock in the standard package&#8230; wtf, whats up with the nitpicking?</p>
<p>aaa no entiendo por que se queja del ecosistema y sigo pensando que los dos gigas del galaxy note son de lo mejor y tiene 4.5 pero en el AMAZON todos le ponen un 9</p>
<p>The speaker isn&#8217;t mono.  It&#8217;s stereo, with one outlet.  Like 90% of tablets.  <br />
Also, directly compared to an ipad, it gets louder, and sounds better.  Yet, I&#8217;m sure the iPad didn&#8217;t get a 5 in that category.</p>
<p>Also,  put the trackpad in gesture mode and the whole keyboard/mouse dock becomes a whole lot more usable.</p>
<p>But hey, I don&#8217;t know how to use this,  so I&#8217;ll just say it lacks here and there and give it a sub par review.</p>
<blockquote>But hey, I don’t know how to use this, so I’ll just say it lacks here and there and give it a sub par review.</blockquote>
<p>Well said.</p>
<p>I would have to firmly disagree with the author of this review because there&#8217;s no performance issues to be had. My parents own a Nexus 7, my uncle owns an iPad 2 and I own an ASUS Transformer Pad Prime and after the Jelly Bean update, it&#8217;s silky smooth and can compete with the other two tablets in fluidity.</p>
<p>Best part is of the comparison is that Jelly Bean is stock on my tablet, it unfortunately unrooted me, but that&#8217;s not a &#8220;life or death&#8221; issue for me, losing root for a few days is still worth the Jelly Bean upgrade. What the author experienced only existed with ICS and has been largely fixed in Jelly Bean thanks to Project Butter and a new kernel (finally it uses a 3.x kernel instead of a 2.6.3x kernel which makes a huge difference because there was a lot of changes between those two kernel lines. While I don&#8217;t agree on NVIDIA using a kernel branch that has gone EOL, it&#8217;s still much better than when it used the 2.6.3x kernel line). The JB update also fixed a lot of graphics driver glitches that plagued ICS because of the new kernel as well.</p>
<p>Seems like the author of this article is biased towards the iPad because this tablet like my Transformer Pad Prime are great competitors at the price of an iPad.</p>
<p>Not sure what you&#8217;re talking about since I owned all 3 of those devices (only iPad and N7 now). The Prime was a jittery mess and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if this is too. The N7 is also stuttery until I turn off all the transition animations in settings. The iPad lags too but rarely. Not the the point of any other Android product imo.</p>
<p>Did you receive and apply the Jelly Bean update to your Prime? It works fine here, I&#8217;m using it right now as we speak. Got no problems here.</p>
<p>Nexus 7 runs smoothly too&#8230;.</p>
<p>Nope I never had stock JB installed on the Prime. I have JB on both my GNex and N7 and they are still jittery here and there. It&#8217;s not necessarily the devices&#8217; faults as its due to Android having a different type of hardware and UI acceleration that&#8217;ll never achieve the smoothness of iOS. I can certainly say its come a long way since GB but its still no where near as smooth as iOS imo.</p>
<p>Then you probably need to install JB since it is really smooth lol. I seriously haven&#8217;t seen any issues on the Nexus 7, not sure what is causing performance issues for you&#8230;. heck, even my Nexus S is quite smooth (from time to time, but it&#8217;s aging hardware so it&#8217;s given that it won&#8217;t be as smooth).</p>
<p>Also these aren&#8217;t same prices as the iPad, that is a bit disingenious.    The Tranformer inifinity is 32G for $499 and the iPad is 16G for $499.</p>
<p>Yeah a 32GB for $499 and 16GB for $499 is not the same price. Good one.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s  not   a 32G iPad starts at $599  that&#8217;s a $100 more than the 32G Asus.  So no it&#8217;s not the same price.</p>
<p>Well considering there isn&#8217;t a 16GB Transformer Infinity your point is moot. The iPad has an infinitely better GPU but its still priced at $499. It must be worth more than the ASUS! Lmao learn to troll properly idiot.</p>
<p>no it isn&#8217;t moot.   storage is storage.  Nevermind the fact that it also comes with a micro SD card slot.  So in essence you could grab a 16G card off of Amazon for about $20  and give yourself 48G&#8217;s of storage   for $520.  That is much bigger value.</p>
<p>You are a real true to life fankid aren&#8217;t you.   You have no idea what&#8217;s actually out there.  but you sure do love to Astroturf .</p>
<p>Yup because storage is everything lmao. What&#8217;s the cheapest Asus Infinity? $499? What&#8217;s the cheapest iPad 3? $499? $499 and $499 sure are different. Get your beady little eyes checked kid.</p>
<p>storage is important.  these devices are really tailored made for watching movies on the go, for storing home videos and photo&#8217;s and for reading.   Many of these take up alot of space.</p>
<p>I think iPhans live in this bubble where everyone buys a tablet to only use Garage band .</p>
<p>there is so much more to a tablet than runing  garageband and twitter.  egads man expand your horizons.</p>
<p>Yup that&#8217;s what the cloud is for. To save all your movies, photos, home videos, etc. You can do that perfectly fine on a 16-64GB format as well if you really needed it. DropBox, Google Drive, iCloud, SkyDrive are all around for a reason. Who the hell said anything about Garageband? Don&#8217;t be mad cause your precious Transformer scored low. So I guess the N7 is a piece of trash since it only comes with 8-16GB of storage according to your standards. What do you do on your tablet that you can&#8217;t on any other tablet with only 16GB of storage? Thought so.</p>
<p>Inferior CPU<br />
Inferior GPU<br />
Inferior Screen<br />
Inferior Camera</p>
<p>for the same price. But yeah that Micro SD slot sure makes up for all its shortcomings. I&#8217;m sure your Kobo tablet with Micro SD slot makes up for everything else too and should be the same price as the iPad.</p>
<p>Is it wrong that I&#8217;m content with my original Kindle Fire?</p>
<p>Yes. Do yourself a favor and sell it. Get yourself a N7. You&#8217;ll be a lot happier.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe what you said about the performance post 4.1 update. My Prime is ridiculously smooth now after the 4.1 update &#8211; unless Asus took a step or two backwards, it&#8217;s hard for me to believe this. My Prime was smooth with ICS and got even better with JB.</p>
<p>If your definition of ICS/JB is smooth, then its just not worth arguing. Its smoothER than GB but it doesn&#8217;t come close when actually compared to iOS.</p>
<p>hmmm   Gingergerbread was never on any Asus Tablets.   your astroturfing story is revealing it&#8217;s cracks.  Not like you needed to be a detective to figure you how much you lie.</p>
<p>I was talking about Android in general. Your reading comprehension also shows your lack of education. Go back to community college and maybe you can learn a thing or two.</p>
<p>If I were Apple your intern A$$$ would be fired,   You have to be one of the worst astroturfers out there.     you are about as covert as a window.</p>
<p>What are you even ranting about? You&#8217;re mad cause I own all these devices and have actually used them on a daily basis? Go back to playing with your Pantech tablet or whatever it is you got.</p>
<p>Pantech? According to your statements it could be any OEM as long as its Android, so why does it matter if it&#8217;s a Pantech or Samsung?</p>
<p>I sold a &#8216;the new iPad&#8217; so I could buy the Infinity because I couldn&#8217;t seamlessly edit Google Docs with iOS. And yes, before anyone asks, I tried the litany of document editing apps in the App Store, even paying $20 for one of them but they either wouldn&#8217;t handle synchronizing properly and create multiple versions of the doc or the formatting wouldn&#8217;t translate well between the browser-based editor and my local editor.  Also, the keyboard experience with the Infinity is far superior to the iPad+BT keyboard as it feels designed in from the beginning as opposed to being half-baked with the iPad. Even with all that the overall experience was better with the iPad (I still miss the multi-touch gestures on the iPad to close apps and go to the most-recently-used apps) but the Infinity is much more functional given my unique needs.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, I know Google recently released an update to the Drive app on iOS to allow editing locally but I haven&#8217;t tried it.</p>
<p>If I had one bone to pick with how this (and similar full sized android tablet) reviews, it is that the tendency to be compare the  device to the iPad empirically distorts the reality that very few people are going to use two full size tablets interchangeably. By most measures (gross tablet apps available, PPI, mindshare) this tablet trails the new iPad, but that is not the full story of this device. I think David was fair in his criticisms &#8211; and his praise &#8211; of this device (save a few exceptions), but I would argue that he failed to answer the question, &#8220;Does the Transformer Infinity effectively do what it aims to do?&#8221;  My answer would be a qualified <a href="(since">yes</a> the Jelly Bean update) the Infinity is the best &#8220;light laptop&#8221; on the market, although it could do some things better.</p>
<p>Comparing the Infinity to the iPad really is apples to oranges (lame pun intended). Though both technically work as stand alone tablet devices, the iPad is clearly not designed to be used with a keyboard and the Infinity was designed specifically for hybrid functionality. The fact is though they are comparable on price, the Infinity is $100 less expensive (or $50 more expensive with the dock) for both the 32 and 64 GB Wi-Fi models &#8211; the iPad really is built exclusively for touch input whereas the Infinity has more in common with the soon-to-market Windows 8 hybrid devices. In this way, it makes as much sense criticizing the iPad for lack of secondary battery and trackpad as it does criticizing the Infinity for not having the same breadth of software as the iOS device.</p>
<p>Google has built Android to be scaled to a multitude of devices, which is both a blessing and a curse. The Blessing is that the same OS can power phones, PMPs, tablets, hyrids, and set top boxes. The curse is that many of us users (and even many developers) conflate a flexible OS with flexible software (and for that matter hardware) and that dog don&#8217;t hunt. Google TV has different use cases, power requirements, and limitations than an android phone, and the same is true for tablets and hybrids. Androids app situation is clearly less than ideal (with lots of blame to go around) but this is a different discussion; the question before us is &#8220;Does the Infinity succeed as a hybrid?&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in New York City and ride public transit almost exclusively and often for long trips. My work requires that I have persistent access to email and voicemail, engage in some &#8220;light computing&#8221; (accessing spreadsheets, word processing, viewing things on YouTube), and that I maintain a social media presence while I am out and about, and occasionally requires more intensive computing (which I can almost always put off until I am out of the field and back in an office environment).  In short, I feel like I am the perfect test case for a hybrid device and for me the Infinity is the best option available.</p>
<p>For all the talk of what Android lacks in terms of ecosystem, for my money it is the most capable for someone who prefers the cloud to carting around a full sized laptop. There are a plethora of choices for purchasing/ streaming music and movies, and books, Chrome, Gmail, Google Voice, and now Maps (!) sync  across cloud for something approximating the ever-elusive continuous client utopia, and I can have access up to 100 GBs of my own music, while playing a video game during the commute home. Though there is no US Infinity variant with LTE, much improved WiFi and Bluetooth (thanks to the redesign), GPS, and seriously bonkers battery life ( with the dock handy, you can spend all day watching 1080p movies at automatic brightness and stream the audio over Bluetooth with WiFi, GPS, and background syncing on and you&#8217;ll have to worry more about getting fired for watching movies all day before you worry about running out of juice) is a device that takes full advantage of the myriad content available through Google Play.</p>
<p>This is not to say the Infinity is perfect, nor is it for everyone. Before the Jelly Bean update the device while by no means unusable, had too many performance issues (random app crashes, device restarts) related to stability. Unfortunately, some of those persist, but they have been tremendously reduced. In my experience, Jelly Bean has greatly reduced lag &#8211; and lag specifically related to touch input), but it the OS itself is more computationally intensive. The result is a device that seems to be faster but is not measurably more efficient. For me, I sometimes forget that I am using a hybrid and not a full laptop, only to be reminded of this reality when it try to quickly navigate between 4 or 5 apps. For me, this use case reaffirms the reality that hybrids and tablets are still immature products, but it does not condemn the Infinity; after all is there another full HD device on the market that can multitask better? The answer, new iPad included, is no.</p>
<p>It would be great if folks developed apps for Android with the express knowledge although the OS supports multiple form factors, your app may not &#8211; especially if it was built for phone first. Google bares responsibility for this as their new tablet guidelines seem to acknowledge, and so do developers. Twitter for instance, sucks on iPad as much as it sucks on Android tablets and it is a market leader in social as well on on both platforms. Still, the app story is only part of the Infinity story: the larger narrative is that Asus has pioneered a new class of ARM powered tabet-laptop hybrid devices and the Infinity &#8211; with Jelly Bean- is not only their best iteration, it is the best device in the class available for purchase today.  Surely, there will be stiff competition from Windows 8 devices &#8211; some even made by Asus &#8211; but for users who need the flexibility of a hybrid, the ubiquity of a battery-sipping lightweight full-keyboard device, and the usefulness of Google&#8217;s cloud productivity offerings, this is by far the best device you can buy today and should be the device you measure future hybrids running Windows or iPad-keyboard combos against.</p>
<p>(Written on an Asus TF 700.)</p>
<blockquote> the Infinity is the best "light laptop" on the market/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
You really cannot be serious.</blockquote>
<p>maybe you should try using one.</p>
<p>Perhaps i should have said &#8220;laptop light&#8221; &#8211; either way I mean a device that is built to handle simple to moderate productivity-related computational tasks, provide full screen access to media content, and is built to include mobile use cases (long battery life, lightweight, GPS functionality). If you read (my admittedly long-winded post) I believe there is a place in the market between ultrabooks and tablets and this device is fills that place better than anything else currently available.</p>
<p>An Ultrabook/Macbook AIr performs your &#8220;laptop light&#8221; function much better.<br />
The only advantage this has is the ability to remove the keyboard and use a touchscreen.<br />
Against it it has a poor range of apps and functionality versus a laptop and a poor aspect ratio for tablet use</p>
<p>I humbly disagree  that 1)Macbook Airs/ ultrabooks are &#8220;laptop lights&#8221; and 2) that they fill the requirements of a &#8220;laptop light&#8221; better. Core I5 and I7 devices are simply in a different power consumption/ computational class. Though some are &#8220;thin and light&#8221; they are frankly full power machines &#8211; and comparing them to ARM powered tablet -notebook hybrids is kind of silly. Form-factor aside, you are essentially comparing the chip architecture of the iPhone and iPad to that of Apple&#8217;s &#8220;pro-sumer&#8221; notebooks. There is a reason the Infinity with dock cost about half what a decent ultrabook does.</p>
<p>I would also add that the ability to remove the keyboard is not trivial, it creates the opportunity to use the device in a whole host of use cases clam-shell notebooks are ill-suited for, while providing the markedly better typing options than tablets.</p>
<p>Lastly,  Android 4.x is optimized for the 16 &#215; 9 aspect ratio. To say that that aspect ratio is poor for tablets without qualification is just an articulation of your preference.  The OS is built to allow scrollable &#8211; and now dynamically resizeable &#8211; widgets that, in  my opinion, look great in both landscape and portrait  orientation at 16 &#215; 9. For me, homescreen access to my calendar, email, voicemail, RSS feed, and Chrome shortcuts is in itself a &#8220;killer app.&#8221; What&#8217;s more, these widgets work better (in terms of how much information is presented and ease of touch navigation ) in widescreen presentation. And of course, watching HD video content is dramatically improved in 16 &#215; 9 as compared to 4 &#215; 3.</p>
<p>More than just disagreeing with you, I am trying to make the point that there is real market for devices in this hybrid class (and it sure looks like Microsoft agrees). Asus worked with Google to create a great tablet (Nexus  7), but what they have done on their own with the Transformer line is to be the first OEM to produce a viable hybrid device in the modern mobile landscape &#8211; and with the Infinity running 4.1 I believe they have come as close to great without being great as is possible.</p>
<p>Does the device has some flaws and limitations &#8211; yes, in much the same way that the first generation Macbook Air did. And much like that same Macbook Air, I think the Infinity is a category defining piece of kit, flaws and all.</p>
<p>not interested in any tablet that can&#8217;t run WOW or Eve, or many of the online games&#8230;..waiting&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>Nice review.</p>
<p>Google Now looks so good on a large tablet. I really like where Google is taking Android in terms of design.</p>
<p>Hey David Pierce, the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity and the Nexus 7 aren&#8217;t the only ones with 4.1. Jelly Bean. The Wifi Motorola Xoom tablet has had it since July.</p>
<p>You guys even say so, too. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/27/3192649/motorola-xoom-android-4-1-1-update-ota" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/27/3192649/motorola-xoom-android-4-1-1-update-ota</a></p>
<p>Did this tablet get delayed?  I remember back when the iPad 3 came out, all the android fans named this thing as the iPad 3 killer, even though it wasn&#8217;t released yet.  It feels so long ago.</p>
<p>Just announced well before it was actually due to ship.<br />
At least they didn&#8217;t rush it to market unfinished and then have to pull it  like the Transformer Prime</p>
<p>No, it didn&#8217;t get delayed.  It came out in July.  This guy decided to hold off on reviewing it until it got Jelly Bean (which happened in the last week or so).  I was confused about that at first, too.</p>
<p>He did delay the review for 4.1. Though I was thinking the same&#8230;</p>
<p>Ack!  Tiny right-shift key!  Hate hate hate!</p>
<p>Thanks for the close-up of the right-hand side of the keyboard.  That&#8217;s a key thing I look at when purchasing devices with keyboards.</p>
<p>The right-hand fn-key is a decent touch.  One-hand access to page up/down home/end.</p>
<p>I wish netbook / tablet keyboard makers would use half-height arrow keys and a full width shift key instead.  For bonus points stick a half-height fn-key above the right arrow key.  The Acer Aspire One and HP Mini keyboards were the netbook keyboards I hated least.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll stick with my Logitech Android keyboard, which aside from the lack of a logo key for Mac and Windows interoperability, is a great keyboard.</p>
<p>10&quot; keyboard docks are a rehash of the same keyboard pain that came with netbooks.  I won&#8217;t go any smaller than my 11.6&quot; Macbook Air for keyboards.  This form factor makes a ton more sense at the 11.6&quot; size, if it doesn&#8217;t make the tablets over-large.</p>
<p>I am tempted by the body of this thing.  It&#8217;s a beautiful tablet and has a 4.1 update!  That&#8217;s really slick.  And Asus has been really good about updates.  Right now I&#8217;m rocking a used AT&amp;T Galaxy Tab 8.9, and it&#8217;s a bit bigger than I really like, compared to the 7&quot; tablets.  I was thinking it would be a nice middle ground, but it&#8217;s impossible to use one-handed.  I might give up on a lightweight occasionally one-handed tablet (the Nexus 7 is so close but lacks HDMI out!) in which case the Transformer Infinity is a clear top choice.</p>
<p>Or I&#8217;ll just wait and see what happens with Android 4.2 and multiple Nexuses this fall.</p>
<p>I want lightweight, 7-9&quot; screen, HDMI out, minimum 1280&#215;800 resolution.  Bonus points for a capable desktop dock with HDMI out, 3.5mm audio out, and full-size USB.</p>
<p>How about the Kindle HD 8.9?</p>
<p>Hardware looks great, as does the Kindle Fire HD 7.</p>
<p>No Kindle skins.  I&#8217;d prefer as close to stock Android as possible.</p>
<p>I have an original Kindle Fire with a stock JB ROM on it, but it has lots of bugs and I&#8217;ve heard the new Kindles have locked bootloaders.  The XDA forum for the HD 7 is dead, and the Kindle HD 8.9 doesn&#8217;t even have one yet.</p>
<p>A nexus device would be ideal.</p>
<p>Does Asus have any non-keyboard docks?  I thought they did once upon a time, but they seem to have since disappeared.</p>
<p>Not really the only other tablet with jellybean beside the Nexus 7. The other ASUS tablets like the TF300 and Transformer Prime got JellyBean as well.</p>
<p>I keep hearing reviewers say that there aren&#8217;t many good Android tablet apps.  I have the Transformer Pad Infinity.  Every app I use frequently on my phone has a tablet version, save Facebook.  Granted, I use a lot of Google apps, which are all tablet optimized, but there are a number of others (BeyondPod, Mantano Reader, Tasks, etc) that work great in tablet mode.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never owned an iPad.  If I had, perhaps I&#8217;d agree that the number of Android tablet apps is small relative to the number of iPad apps.  But the number of Android tablet apps for me is sufficient to meet my needs.</p>
<p>There are  almost 250000 iPad specific apps. Games, social apps, productivity apps, kids apps, cooking apps, content creation apps. Along with your regular stuff</p>
<p>Main issue is you compare a tweetbot for iPad and u don&#8217;t have any app on any platform that comes close. Same for Facebook</p>
<p>Android has FriendCaster and TweetComb. It has TouchDown for Exchange (goodluck finding something similar on iOS).</p>
<p>iOS does exchange out of the box, not sure what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Friend caster? Tweet comb. Tell me again when tweet comb can even remotely compete with tweetbot</p>
<p>Exchange support out of the box in iOS is awful. Precisely why I maintain a professional Android Tablet with Touchdown HD on it.  Try it out on a Android tablet before you comment to see the features and experience difference. I agree about TweetComb. But Friend Caster is really great on Android tablets, try it out before you comment.</p>
<p>M okay with plume. It&#8217;s become fairly usable now. And doesn&#8217;t make me wanna pluck my eyes out</p>
<p>Also <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchdown-for-ios/id560596861?mt=8" target="_blank">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchdown-for-ios/id560596861?mt=8</a></p>
<p>If u need it. I&#8217;m okay with what exchange offers me right now. Get my invites, get my GAL and calendars email works.</p>
<p>Yeah. Touchdown&#8217;s iOS support is Alpha (or even worse). BTW, Android does Exchange out of the box the same way iOS does, but compare that with desktop Outlook and you know the difference. That&#8217;s why most iPad users in my circles use the exchange webmail in the safari browser :-). Touchdown HD on Android tablets is the closest match of the desktop Outlook. Just use it once, you will not look elsewhere. Off course that&#8217;s if being a power user with office collaboration matters to you.</p>
<p>This is why I believe Windows 8 surface has a good shot at the Enterprise market.</p>
<p>$20 and ugly as hell?  Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Exchange works fine in stock Android, unless your mail server goes down, in which case the Exchange service on JB has a bug that will drain your battery (fixed in 4.1.2).</p>
<p>Needs windows 8</p>
<p>The Xoom called, it wants it&#8217;s &#8220;first tablet other than the Nexus 7 to have Jelly bean&#8221; award back.</p>
<p>It will take it to court if need be.</p>
<p>Oh good point! But still&#8230; it&#8217;s the XOOM.</p>
<p>You called it 1080p a few times by accident.</p>
<p>I briefly owned one of these a couple months ago .  The Tegra 3 just isn&#8217;t up to driving that 1920&#215;1080 display with the smoothness we all like.   It&#8217;s not that the Nexus 7 is running a cleaner OS, it&#8217;s that the Nexus 7 is running a much lower resolution.</p>
<p>Performance issues aside, my biggest issue was the extreme backlight bleeding on every edge.  I should also mention that while it has lust-inducing industrial design, actually using it was almost painful, ergonomically.   Another problem, somewhat yucky, is that those attractive machined whirls in the back surface became skin-cell and body oil magnets pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m back to occasional use of my Nexus 7 (occasional because I&#8217;m on my third unit, 41 days of my ownership since launch day have been used waiting on warranty replacements for bad USB, terrible screen lift, and of course the ever-popular Asus screen bleeding issues).</p>
<p>So my &#8220;daily driver&#8221; tablet is still a year-old Galaxy Tab 8.9 LTE (Qualcomm S3-powered).   Better display and speakers than the Nexus, better ergonomics than the Transformer (and similar performance in tasks such as browsing), 8.9&quot; is a great form factor, and there&#8217;s not a single QC issue.  With the ICS leak installed on it, I reckon it&#8217;ll carry me to the next generation of Android tablets.</p>
<p>Bookshelf shot!</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t we all just get along :C</p>
<p>I love my iPad 3, but I got my dad a Nexus 7 because it&#8217;s a great tablet and he&#8217;s already used to his Android phone. There&#8217;s so much anger and bitter vitriol in this comment section. YOU SUCK. NO YOU SUCK! NO YOU FUCKING SUCK AND SO DOES EVERYTHING YOU OWN!</p>
<p>I remember popping in to The Verge for the first time and being astonished by the nice, level headed, intelligent commenters. What the fuck happened? The content is as awesome as ever, but the audience has turned into Engadget &amp; Wired 2.0. Don&#8217;t you guys ever get sick of screaming in this echo chamber?</p>
<p>The only tech related site with comments that don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m watching teens try to evaluate their life worth by what smartphone OS they use is ArsTech. And even there, trolls still derail shit easily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame, like you say. Content is awesome but the comments/community are just goddamn awful for the most part.</p>
<p>wacom ultra portable graphics tablet please.</p>
<p>I just have to respond when I see reviews which say you might be happier with one from the other guys. If all your services are with Google, how can you put up accessing them via half broken middleware for IOS and WP? I tried to sell a friend on switching to Android but he does not even have gmail and all his content and shows he buys are through itunes which is never going to sync to a non-IOS device. My point is many people already have an investment in hardware or services from MS or Apple or Google and breaking up is way too hard to do.. You can choose among the offerings from Android or MS or Apple, but lets not even joke that hard core techs like those reading this site are going to jump to another ecosystem just over a few specs</p>
<p>android Ui is a mess.<br />
No surprise if next android will copy Win8 a LOT.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a joke that it doesn&#8217;t get at least an 8.0<br />
Still too many performance issues&#8230;. ? Like what? so Apple has no lags, no app crashes? This is a bias joke  and questionable review. I&#8217;m sorry for calling out on this. I usually don&#8217;t care about the complains of people make regarding apple bias or windows hatred by theverge. But seriously,  this review is a joke when you compare it with an ipad and makes it sound like an ipad is a perfect device. I think the problem why companies have to make ad campaign against apple all the time is also had to do with these kind of  nonsense comparison. &#8220;Dock is heavy&#8221; then don&#8217;t use the dock. It&#8217;s an add-on extension. You don&#8217;t have to use it. Does apple give you a dock? Sorry, for attacking apple. Sorry, apple fans. I just want to make a point about irreverent comparison in the review. I agree on the &#8220;App ecosystem lags iOS&#8221; but only on tablets app and I think most common popular apps are not the issue. Sorry, David, I enjoy most of your reviews, but this reviews just felt a little bias.      <em>Peace everybody, Apple, Android, and Windows fans.</em></p>
<blockquote>Still too many performance issues…. ? Like what?</blockquote>
<p>Did you even watch the video?</p>
<blockquote>compare it with an ipad and makes it sound like an ipad is a perfect device. </blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the same price point, of course it&#8217;s going to be compared. And the actual result was: if you want an Android tablet, get the Nexus 7 instead unless the higher res and keyboard are a really big deal to you.</p>
<blockquote>"Dock is heavy" then don’t use the dock. It’s an add-on extension. You don’t have to use it.</blockquote>
<p>How on Earth you call this review biased whilst at the same time spout apologist nonsense like this is beyond me. iOS 6 Maps are optional, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s immune to criticism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m puzzled as to how the Infinity scored only 7.6 overall, when the Prime scored 8.4. I&#8217;d love to see an updated score for the Prime now that it&#8217;s running JellyBean.</p>
<blockquote>carrying a dock that&#8217;s nearly as heavy as the tablet kind of defeats the point of such a &#8220;portable&#8221; device. </blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, is 2.6 pounds heavy for you? Eat more meat or something, dude.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s why they call him captain noodle arms</p>
<p>In simple terms, coupled with the dock/keyboard, the Transformer Infinity 700 marries the best of two worlds- tablet and netbook. As a tablet it offers exquisite touch screen clarity, brightness, color and balance, smooth/fast performance, reliability and overall superb form, fit and function design. As a netbook, it offers support for unlimited storage expansion, a well integrated keyboard and the ability to experience the superb Android ecosystem of applications, notifications and interactivity.</p>
<p>The only comparable product is Microsoft’s Surface tablet. In comparison there are pros and cons. The Android ecosystem has far more breadth. However Windows 8 on the Surface may offer more interoperability with a desktop running Windows 8. The Surface’s characteristics as a tablet such as screen quality and responsiveness are inferior to the Transformer Infinity. The overall designs of both the Transformer and the Surface have pros and cons.</p>
<p>Both products and the approach they represent have the potential to more effectively move the tablet from a consumption device to a true productivity/content creation device- effectively combining the power and interactivity of a tablet with the productivity of a netbook/laptop.</p>
<p>Apple is for idle sheep following the flock of izombies over the cliff of apathetic pneumonia.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Sony will say that &#8220;it is truly sorry&#8221; that it cannot upgrade any phones to Jelly Bean. Wanna bet?</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re mistaking Sony with Nokia and Microsoft and Jelly Bean with Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>Or maybe HTC and the Desire HD, or all the other HTC, LG, Moto and Samsung phones that don&#8217;t get upgraded</p>
<p>I hope they don&#8217;t bloat Jelly bean with their crap..!</p>
<p>their &#8220;crap&#8221; actually pretty lightweight thought</p>
<p>They probably have the best &#8220;crap&#8221; compared to any other oem out there.</p>
<p>Why take so long for an answer? Just be upfront with people and tell them yes or no.</p>
<p>Because if the answer is &#8220;no&#8221; a person might decide to buy a different phone.</p>
<p>Because they don&#8217;t know yet. Sony is usually pretty good abut updates, but it&#8217;ll take awhile to get everything ready, squish all the bugs and then finally decide if the end product is better than their current ICS offering. When they have to flipflop on an update its usually because they thought it would work and then they ran into trouble actually building the update.</p>
<p>Sony just needs to stop manufacturing their phones. Right now.</p>
<p>This is the first time I heard they were still making phones. Apparently they make some Android ones. Nuts.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that? Sony PR forgot about that one lowly engineer still working on Jelly Bean for their 2011 phones? Oh, at least someone remembered.</p>
<p>their phones are nice<br />
problem is once they actually get released they are usually already behind in the software aspect<br />
also once their phones make it to the carriers &#8211; they get dumbed down to look like every other phone (ion)</p>
<p>Sony is the absolute WORST manufacturer when it comes to updating their phones.</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>They are the best, they updated their whole Xperia 2011 line to ICS you fool. Motorola, Samsung, LG &#8211; now those are bad!</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t seen the X10 update saga I guess..</p>
<p>people already forget that since they updated it to 2.3</p>
<p>The x10 saga is what I&#8217;m referring to.  Girlfriend had the x10 which came with 1.6.  Sony had promised an update, yet more than two years with the phone, an update never came.  Now, whether thats an AT&amp;T problem or a Sony Ericsson problem, I don&#8217;t know.  Maybe things have changed since Sony bought the entire phone division.</p>
<p>That was indeed a debacle.  Exactly like my samsung behold II that came with 1.5 with a promise of an update to 2.x &#8211; a promise that was quickly broken by shamesung.  Sony appears to have learned from that, they updated/are updating just about every one of their 2011/2012 line.  Samsung updates their flagships with more touchwiz but anything else not so much.  HTC has updated quite a few but more inconsistently than sony.  At this time, sony appears to be the best at updates.</p>
<blockquote>At this time, sony appears to be the best at updates.</blockquote>
<p>As someone who has been in the Android world awhile, thats a very weird thing to read.</p>
<p>That one&#8217;s an AT&amp;T problem; unbranded X10s have 2.3 and, IIRC, AT&amp;T did roll out the 2.1 update eventually.</p>
<p>Wrong. They&#8217;re the best actually. Tell me of another manufacturer that updated all their phones from 2011 to ICS.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re second to only nexus lines in update, that are you smoking?</p>
<p>Thank you, Sony!</p>
<p>The 2011 Xperia phones are suffering the same thing as early HTC phones (eg. Nexus One), that they have extremely limited internal storage. Added with Sony&#8217;s own bloatware, the amount left for users is not much. I do hope for JB as ICS is not that smooth on my Arc.</p>
<p>Every single manufacturer seems to have this issue where they can&#8217;t seem to define a coherent message and then get their people to STICK to it vis-a-vis Android upgrades. How many times now has a random PR person said something, the corporate HQ says something else, everything gets lost in doublespeak for months until a truth emerges?</p>
<blockquote>We are actively investigating Android OS upgrades for all devices</blockquote>
<p>This could just as well mean that none of their existing phones are getting Android 4.1. Which is more probable if history is any measure.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight: We are going to keep seeing article after article PERPETUALLY from every last Android OEM about every damn phone that will or won&#8217;t get upgraded to every major and minor Android OS update? Yes? Cool then. Google should fix this mess, just so that I don&#8217;t have to suffer :)</p>
<p>Ofcourse we will. It&#8217;s great for flame wars about &#8220;fragmentation&#8221; which give a lot of page hits.</p>
<p>Is it really Google&#8217;s fault? May not be theirs to fix. There is a series of hoops for the OS to jump through in order to make it onto the phone. Skins, carriers, there are a lot of parties involved that want to add their own touch to the Google experience.</p>
<p>lets be clear here&#8230; this has nothing to do with specs&#8230; ALL manufacturers are weighing in the advantages and disadvantages of upgrading their phones in 2 aspects</p>
<p>1) Money <br />
2) and money</p>
<p>The only reason they would not invest in updating their phones is because they want to make more money by selling new hardware and a good hook to buy new hardware is that the old one is outdated in terms of software.</p>
<p>If only these OEM&#8217;s stopped this crap of skinning a perfectly good OS with their Ugly UI  the world would be much better. Android Jelly Bean is Beautiful. Why don&#8217;t they just leave it be and concentrate on giving up the best hardware possible at their best price&#8230; I do not want to buy the cheapest, especially if I know that a good hardware will allow be to enjoy a few more versions of android updates.</p>
<p>That is the reason why Nokia did such a stupid thing when they decided to go with microsoft (according to them then wanted differentiation)</p>
<p>All you need to give me is hardware excellence! I do not see anyone buying a different brand of computer because of a certain skin on windows 7. Why do we have to wait so long for OEM to finally do the right think for their customers??!!</p>
<p>Very true. Skins are obtrusive. I&#8217;ve had Sense, TouchWhiz, and Moto and they got in the way so much. The light shines on the Nexus and I love my phone. True Google experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d appreciate that, Sony.  In the meantime, could you fix the notification LED, which was broken by the 4.0.4 update? Thanks.</p>
<p>head up to xda and install the patch, then light flow lite, good to go (cost a bit of ram, sadly, the patch will fix SMS and Mail and apps notification, but missed call still missing)</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Dear Sony, Please Jelly the Xperia Pro &#8211; it&#8217;s a lovely phone thanks to the superb slide out QWERTY keyboard, but a bit sluggish sometimes &#8211; could do with some &#8216;Project Butter&#8217;. :) Thanks!</p>
<p>Sony phones are gorgeous. I just can&#8217;t stand all that front screen branding.  Save it for the back</p>
<p>The Sony skin really isn&#8217;t that bad, but still is lacking in comparison to a true Jelly Bean OS. I am excited to see what they do to their Xperia line if in fact they do upgrade to JB.</p>
<p>I think Asus means the TF300 when they said Eee Pad Transformer.</p>
<p>FYI, CM developers already have a 4.1 build that works beautifully on TF101 and TF201: <a href="http://androidroot.mobi/2012/07/18/cyanogenmod-10-preview-edition/" target="_blank">http://androidroot.mobi/2012/07/18/cyanogenmod-10-preview-edition/</a></p>
<p>(been running this on my prime, and it performs remarkably better than Asus&#8217; last official software)</p>
<p>Asus continues to rock it</p>
<blockquote>Looks like it&#8217;s the TF300T, not the TF101, that&#8217;s getting the upgrade.</blockquote>
<p>Erm, what about us TF201 owners? D:</p>
<p>I mean I suppose I can just use jrrr&#8217;s link for CM10 on the Prime, but it&#8217;d be a lot more convenient if Asus was still supporting the 201 and made this available.</p>
<p>From what I read  ALL, including the 200, the slider and athe Original TF101  of the Transfomers will be getting the update  this is a quote from their Germany Facebook page;</p>
<p>We need to deny this is clear. Colleagues from the Netherlands have made no statement about TF101/SL101, but merely confirmed that a Jelly Bean TF201/TF300/TF700 update be received. The converse, in that is not a TF101/SL101 JB update received are false and pure speculation. According to current knowledge, even users of older TF101/SL101 to benefit from a Android 4.1 update to come.</p>
<p><a href="http://phandroid.com/2012/07/18/asus-germany-confirms-android-4-1-jelly-bean-coming-to-og-transformer-tf101-and-eee-pad-slider/" target="_blank">http://phandroid.com/2012/07/18/asus-germany-confirms-android-4-1-jelly-bean-coming-to-og-transformer-tf101-and-eee-pad-slider/</a></p>
<p>Sweetness. Thanks for the reply! :D</p>
<p>Dude, it says Transformer Prime right in the article.</p>
<p>It will be amazing to have the TF101 updated to 4.1. I can&#8217;t wait to see it. My dad owns one. That tegra 2 processor should fly with it. I really hope they update it.</p>
<p>I have one too, they have been really good with the updates so I hope they continue to support my tablet, its not even that old when you think about it</p>
<p>Asus is proving to be the best with updates of all the OEM&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Definitely. I have had one since the launch of the TF101. I was one of the very few who got one right at launch.</p>
<p>Asus has consistently gotten updates out fast and fixes when needed. Their continued support means that future Android tablets I buy will also be from Asus. I&#8217;ve also recommended it to a bunch of other people. Currently there are 8 TF101 Transformers sold on my recommendation. This is what happens when you give good support after the sale.</p>
<p>Off topic: it&#8217;s really annoying to see the stickers left on the tablet. Why don&#8217;t people remove them? Same goes for &#8220;Intel inside&#8221; and &#8220;made for windows 7&#8221; and such crap. Just remove them when you unpack, alright?</p>
<p>The only other thing that annoys me as much is people using group photos as their profile pictures&#8230; fuctards&#8230;</p>
<p>that&#8217;s only an instructional sticker on how to properly dock it,  It peels off quite easily.   It&#8217;s not an adverstising sticker or anything like that.</p>
<blockquote>It peel off quite easily</blockquote>
<p>Oh&#8230; so what are they waiting for? Or do they need to re-read the instructions?</p>
<p>#quotefail #neededitbutton</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t removed it on my tf300t yet. In case I want to return it or for resell value.</p>
<p>Alright, that&#8217;s a valid reason.</p>
<p>The Asus Unlock Tool doesn&#8217;t work on my (and a few others) Transformer Primes. I guess now there&#8217;s something to look forward to if I&#8217;m still forced to have my bootloader locked&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really see much point in releasing a mid-range phone to such fanfare. Pentile display?! I also thought we had seen the last of those&#8230;</p>
<p>You may not see the point, but there is an existing customer base who have no clue what the difference is between a PenTile and non-PenTile display is and don&#8217;t want a 4.8&quot; phone, but would happily pick this one up. Wow! That was a long sentence.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the camp of wanting a phone smaller than 4.8&quot;, and while I care about PenTile, it&#8217;s on my Galaxy Nexus and I could live with it. The problem is the mid-range hardware of this phone. It doesn&#8217;t entice me to buy. Why won&#8217;t any manufacturer put the good stuff in a smaller screen, akin to Apple?!</p>
<p>This is not a great comparison, but its debatable about the &#8220;good stuff&#8221; as both these devices have &#8220;1Ghz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM&#8221;. Apple has the software advantage as far as efficiency goes as it is not as CPU bound compared to Android and WP, so it does not need as much power to get similar results.</p>
<p>Apple supposedly varies the clock speed from 1GHz to 1.3-1.5GHz.</p>
<p>Are you talking about the A6&#8217;s clocks? Where did you hear that?</p>
<p>Annadtech: &#8220;Although we originally thought the A6 ran its two CPU cores at 1GHz, it looks like max clocks range between 800MHz and 1.2GHz depending on load.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6324/the-iphone-5-performance-preview" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6324/the-iphone-5-performance-preview</a></p>
<p>800MHz-1.2GHz makes more sense</p>
<p>But Apple always throws in an enormous GPU so they typically have larger SoCs than the competition. I think some of the quads like Tegra 3 have closed the gap, but those big GPUs still give Apple some of the largest and most power hungry SoCs on the market. That&#8217;s why they can run at lower clocks (to keep power down) and still match performance. It&#8217;s expensive, but this is Apple.</p>
<p>this thing has a tiny battery and crappy camera.</p>
<p>They really should have. Samsung has missed a huge opportunity here to absolutely rule the market.</p>
<p>try the Sony Xperia P</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s kinda hard. It&#8217;s easier to make a slim phone if its other two dimensions are larger. Even the iPhone had to bump one of its dimensions so it could get thinner.</p>
<p>For better or worse, thin is in.</p>
<p>Why does smaller equal low end?</p>
<p>I love big phones, but why don&#8217;t OEMs assume people who want smaller phones, also want great performance?</p>
<p>Exactly, Pentile is not as big of a deal at a higher PPI.  The 315 PPI on the Galaxy Nexus makes Pentile a non-issue.  233 PPI on a 4&quot; WVGA screen (like my two and a half year old Galaxy S!) is not appealing.</p>
<p>Put an iPhone next to a Galaxy Nexus. You will notice the difference quite clearly. I just went from a Galaxy Nexus to an iPhone 5, so I literally put them side-by-side yesterday and compared.</p>
<p>PenTile <em>is</em> a big deal until the PPI reaches a ridiculous number (much higher than 300), and at that point, the subpixel density will have reached the same level as it would have with a 300 PPI display with an RGB subpixel layout.</p>
<p>The point: you can&#8217;t make a display look as clear as another display using less subpixels.</p>
<p>I will give you that the PenTile display on the Galaxy Nexus is much less horrible than that on the original Galaxy S, but that doesn&#8217;t mean both aren&#8217;t bad.</p>
<p>&gt; I will give you that the PenTile display on the Galaxy Nexus is much less horrible than that on the original Galaxy S, but that doesn’t mean both aren’t bad.</p>
<p>This is all I was trying to say.</p>
<p>What I would <strong>really</strong> prefer would be one of those 4&quot; 720p SLCDs that HTC put in their Windows 8 phone.</p>
<p>You said the high PPI of the Galaxy Nexus display makes PenTile a non-issue; I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>I do agree though that high PPI, quality LCDs (like Apple&#8217;s Retina Displays and HTC&#8217;s SLCD2s) are the way to go, at least until OLED can compete in sharpness and color accuracy.</p>
<p>its the nexus s and add dual cores and jelly bean. not much of a big deal in my opinion. they should have kept the 8mp camera, and used super amoled plus. That way they would enter in the market where IIRC only Sony has ventured: not huge but still powerful.</p>
<p>Ugh&#8230; pentile. Average customer won&#8217;t know why, but if you set two phones next to each other, they will probably pick the other and just say it looks &#8220;better,&#8221; but not know why&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe, but 1366&#215;768 TN displays didn&#8217;t permeate the laptop market on their own.</p>
<p>Not that there&#8217;s much of a choice.  Even Apple has always used TN displays for their macbooks, excluding the new Macbook Pro Retina.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a customer base who want a 4&quot; phone that <strong>isn&#8217;t</strong> compromised on specs, but no bloody manufacturers seem to be interested. Why does this seem so hard? Just because I want a smaller screen size doesn&#8217;t mean I want a slow CPU, crappy battery, and crappy camera.</p>
<p>Especially as it doesn&#8217;t have the same specs as the Galaxy S3! Galaxy mini would have worked but &#8220;S3&#8221; implies it&#8217;s the same phone but smaller.</p>
<p>Engadget reported it to be 800 by 480 as well, so add pentile to that and you have a truly lack luster display.</p>
<p>Thought we would be seeing a S3 with an inferior and smaller screen. But the specs definitely isn&#8217;t any where near S3.</p>
<p>I know really disappointing, from what Samsung was saying previously it suggested a smaller screen but great specs but no its just another mid range phone but branded so it can be associated with it&#8217;s big brother.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s just WVGA, and they&#8217;re using a pentile display (which I really don&#8217;t mind anyway), it&#8217;s stupid of them to not just use SAMOLED+ like on the GSII (which also had a WVGA screen). That screen was only 4.3&quot;, so I can&#8217;t imagine it would be hard to scale it down a bit. This is just Samsung being cheap.</p>
<p>That is only an assumption. The Note II AMOLED display does not use the PenTile sub pixel configuration.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t RGB either.</p>
<p>Samsung saw the shitstorm that comes with the word &#8220;pentile&#8221; and they just used an entirely  new subpixel arrangement. Why is this any better (or worse) than pentile?</p>
<p>It is RGB in Note 2. There is no rule that says RGB stripes should be vertically aligned to be called a RGB pixel.</p>
<p>Is it not RBGB?</p>
<p>From the Note II review:</p>
<blockquote>it’s now just swapped the extra green for extra blue</blockquote>
<p><img src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1507431/xs08-29_06-37-17g1020.jpeg" /></p>
<p>It is RGB in Note 2. There is no rule that says RGB stripes should be vertically aligned to be called a RGB pixel.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t look in any way flagship.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it is &#8230; wait for it&#8230;. <strong>mid-range</strong>!!</p>
<p>If it is mid range then it shouldn&#8217;t be using the name S3.</p>
<p>They can call it whatever they want</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t say? It will dilute the Galaxy S as a high end brand though.</p>
<p>They can, but one can still have an opinion as to whether or not they should.</p>
<p>They shouldn&#8217;t but it&#8217;s good for marketing.</p>
<p>The specs look closer to low end at this point. Xperia U?</p>
<blockquote>Pentile display?! I also thought we had seen the last of those…</blockquote>
<p>And when did Samsung anything of the sort? In fact we&#8217;ve practically only seen pentile (pentile-like) displays in their high-end phones since the GNex.</p>
<p>That said, I would have expected a display similar to my GSII&#8217;s SAMOLED+. There may be technical and cost constraints on manufacturing at that slightly higher density, I&#8217;s guess. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but have we ever seen a 4&quot; or under &#8220;plus&#8221; display ship from Samsung?</p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;&#8230;Samsung say anything of the sort?&#8221; and &#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;d guess.&#8221;<br />
Really wish I could edit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter much because you have to say this is pretty clever from Samsung. I personally will not buy a 4 inch phone, too small for me when I plan to upgrade to a new phone but there is still a market for 4 inch out there Samsung want to capture as well with their flagship Galaxy line. We can see Apple doing this with the rumored iPad mini as well. All business as usual.</p>
<p>A midrange phone like this will only add to their growing marketshare, when matched with a modest off contract price.</p>
<p>The worse part is that it&#8217;s 800&#215;480 WVGA, so it&#8217;s largely the same display as my Galaxy S. Coincidentally, my Galaxy S also has a 1500mAh battery and a 5 megapixel camera &#8211; I wonder if Samsung are emptying out their old parts bins to make this phone&#8230;</p>
<p>Not for the CPU. That&#8217;s the only part of this thing that is midrange at this point &#8211; and even that is in some entry level phones.</p>
<p>Blue AMOLED subpixels wear out quickly. So get used to subpixel arrangements that mitigate that problem.</p>
<p>The only reason samsung is releasing this is because so that Apple no longer has a reason to do those stupid adverts talking how he can touch the borders of the screen with his thumb on one hand, even though i can do that with my HTC One X <del>_</del></p>
<p>And so that people wanting a smaller galaxy S3 actually have a choice now.</p>
<p>Oh thats the right reaction to the &#8220;stupid Apple ads&#8221;: release a new lame phone!<br />
Reaction from Apple to Samsung&#8217;s stupid ads: &#8230; yeah waiting for that one.</p>
<p>How do you know it is lame?</p>
<p>He knows it&#8217;s not Apple. For some people that&#8217;s enough.</p>
<p>Combine this quote from samsung<br />
<blockquote>He also noted that it won&#8217;t be an entry-level handset, telling reporters it will have &#8220;full form factor.&#8221;</blockquote><br />
with the specs presented. And there you go &#8211; a lame phone.</p>
<p>Looks perfect for a lot of people. The processor should be more than adequate. Size is vital for so many people. Why is giving people something designed perfectly for them lame?</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t benchmark as well, and your friends will know you saved money getting it&#8230; So yeah. That&#8217;s lame.</p>
<p>They had a real chance to compete with the iPhone 5 &gt;____&gt;</p>
<p>The screen is absolutely horrible. Everything in this phone screams entry-level.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re damaging the reputation of the S line. This is bad bad bad.</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t even seen the screen&#8230; A year ago people hailed the SII, with a lower ppi 480&#215;800, as a best-in-class flagship.<br />
And as for pentile (which this is likely fresh iteration of)&#8230; it&#8217;s cool that reading what it is somewhere gives you permission to be snobbish toward devices no one&#8217;s ever seen or touched.</p>
<p>800&#215;480 pentile screen is much worse than the one SGS2 got. Its a horrible screen which we have seen many times before and nothing short of miracle or unicorn tears can change the technology of it. If it was any better than the old ones, Samsung would add another moniker to the name.</p>
<p>Actually, you haven&#8217;t seen it. The Note 2 uses sub pixel arrangement decided improved over Pentile (with no added moniker to the end). I really doubt you&#8217;ve seen that display either.</p>
<p>Note 2 is not a pentile screen, the subpixels just have a different size they are not shared.</p>
<p>It has similar specs besides the screen to the galaxy nexus. It&#8217;s a good choice for a mid range phone.</p>
<p>Screen, battery, and the Nexus camera is crap. It&#8217;s an entry level phone at midrange prices. Awesome.</p>
<p>Mind blown. Boom.</p>
<p>I do wonder what a &#8220;partial form factor&#8221; phone would look like&#8230;</p>
<p>Putting The Darkness on discount on iTunes</p>
<p>As a fan of Apple how am I supposed to react to Samsung&#8217;s ads?</p>
<p>With laughter. Lighten up.</p>
<p>The same way PC fans put up with YEARS of those I&#8217;m a PC and I&#8217;m a Mac commercials.   Lighten up.</p>
<p>Ur argument is invalid :)</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s response: &#8220;Our 4&#8221; phone is better than yours, both display and hardware.&quot;</p>
<p>Hey OEMs, how about a not crappy 4&quot; phone?</p>
<p>Galaxy S III mini my ass. More like Galaxy Ace III or whatever. Kill it with fire.</p>
<p>This indeed doesn&#8217;t have much in common with the full-sized Galaxy S III but the design.<br />
By that logic, the Galaxy Note II should have been called Galaxy SIII Mega or something like that.</p>
<p>I could go for a GS3 Mega.</p>
<p>Note II</p>
<p>You mean the Note?</p>
<p>Galaxy note 10.1 should be Megatron</p>
<p>Except the Note II has a featureset that the Galaxy S III doesn&#8217;t have, while this is just a shrunk down and cheaper version of the Galaxy S III wholesale.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called unifying the brand. &#8220;Galaxy Ace III&#8221; and similar would confuse consumers.</p>
<p>This</p>
<p>Yeah they are calling this Galaxy SIII only for marketing terms. So people that can&#8217;t afford a &#8220;real&#8221; SIII can still pretend to have one.</p>
<p>I was affraid this was going to dethrone my Xperia P as the best 4 inch Android but this is a VERY average midrange device. If they&#8217;re actually going to market this as a &#8220;high end small phone&#8221; then that&#8217;s just one extra reason for me to hate Samsung.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d buy one. To microwave it.</p>
<p>Such a wasted opportunity to make something great. Who the hell still makes WVGA phones?!</p>
<p>Many, many OEMs are still making budget and mid-range phones with an 800&#215;480 resolution.</p>
<p>Midrange at this point is qHD for some, should be for all.</p>
<p>Wow, Samsung is cramming every &#8220;hole&#8221; they can with something.  The day Sammy falls I will be very happy and satisfied.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a really sad existence you must live&#8230; to live for the day when tech company goes down? Sammy&#8217;s been around for a long time. I guess you&#8217;ll be very sad and unfulfilled until you die.</p>
<p>I have a Samsung phone , but I despise uninspiring companies..</p>
<p>Got it. Clear as mud.</p>
<p>If you despise uninspiring companies, why did you buy a samsung phone?<br />
strange!!!</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s your estimate, will that be before or after you&#8217;ve left your parents basement?</p>
<p>30 more years .. is that good enough for you ? I can add more if you want :P</p>
<p>30 more years of making more money than you huh?</p>
<p>Real classy, big guy!</p>
<p>Oh wow, somebody&#8217;s insecure.</p>
<p>Considering how many different variations of pretty much any possible combination of phones Samsung is creating I can only see their market size increase and increase&#8230;</p>
<p>Gotta love how Samsung dilutes the branding of each and every successful product line they make. What on earth is this thing called &#8216;Galaxy SIII&#8217; mini for? It&#8217;s basically the complete opposite of the &#8216;real&#8217; Galaxy SIII: small, cheap, with low-end specs. The only reason I can think of is that Samsung really wants to trick unsuspecting customers into buying their low-end phones because they heard good things about the high-end ones, much like how they launched a million crap-ass knock-offs of the Galaxy SII, all with completely different hardware, even within the same series.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a hilarious notion, considering no one says the same thing about the iPad Mini and how Apple is diluting the branding. Of course not! Apple isn&#8217;t diluting the branding of its iPad with the Mini, with it&#8217;s (some would say more than) 3 generations old display resolution,  where the Verge surmises, &#8220;will likely be significantly lower quality than any iPad to date, not to mention recent competitors such as the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire HD&#8230; a retina display may well come with too many compromises.&#8221; What if it comes with the same kind of aluminum anodized backing like the iPhone 5? The same scuff proned material? The likely bet is that the iPad Mini won&#8217;t be running the latest chipset, but something along the lines of the A5. Compromise? Dilution? No. Apple is just doing its thing: putting out products that people will buy despite their limitations or lack of spec snuff. I find the double-standard hilarious.</p>
<p>iPad is the name of a whole product line, not of a specific model. I don&#8217;t think people would be complaining if this was called the Galaxy Mini.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the Galaxy SIII mini, that&#8217;s more like if Apple officially called the new iPad &#8220;iPad 3&#8221; then released the iPad mini calling it &#8220;iPad 3 mini&#8221; even though it had specs of an iPad 2.</p>
<p>That&#8217;d be true if the latest iPad was actually called &#8220;iPad 3&#8221;, which it is not anymore. I see your point, but that&#8217;s not valid anymore.</p>
<p>Right, but relevant to Samsung, they normally name their mid-range devices something different. They have several &#8220;Galaxy&#8221; devices, ranging from budget pre-paid phones to their flagship. However, phones with the &#8220;S&#8221; designation have always represented the best they offer(other than the Note, but it&#8217;s arguably a different category), until now.</p>
<p>Completely understand. But that doesn&#8217;t mean a company can&#8217;t shift it&#8217;s business practice, right? They don&#8217;t need customer approval to rethink their naming practice in order to boost sales. I&#8217;m actually okay with this. It was hard to keep track of the Galaxy S, Galaxy Ace, Galaxy Y, Galaxy W, etc., etc. All that nomenclature leads to confusion. When they announced the Mini, the fears were immediate: is this going to be low-end? People knew before the specs were leaked this would be lower end. And it panned out as such. That means by affixing the &#8220;Mini&#8221; at the end, it&#8217;s already clear in people&#8217;s minds where it stands in the line-up. Instead of, is the Galaxy W, Y better than the S? W and Y come after S, gotta be better right?</p>
<blockquote>But that doesn’t mean a company can’t shift it’s business practice, right? They don’t need customer approval to rethink their naming practice in order to boost sales</blockquote>
<p>Actually Samsung stated that they are simplifying the nomenclatures and S is the best, followed by W and Y. Shifting business practice is one thing but this is just a shady move.</p>
<p>Not really, the iPad is just the iPad, Apple never attempted to split the lines into a high and low end device.  The Galaxy <strong>S</strong> has traditionally been their high end device.</p>
<p>True, for now. But once the iPad Mini releases, your contention will be blown to shreds. The iPad Mini will not be of iPad 3 caliber.</p>
<p>Except Apple has never said anything about high or low end. Samsung clearly stated S is supposed to be their high end device. Thus calling it a mini S3 is very misleading, especially when they already have lots of similar mid range devices.</p>
<p>Hence, the &#8216;mini&#8217;.  The &#8216;mini&#8217; product is always inferior.  The iPad branding is equivalent to Galaxy.  The Galaxy S III is almost like saying Galaxy Flagship Entry-Level.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the iPad 2 a low end iPad now? Apple just age their product into the low end instead of releasing low end products.</p>
<p>Who said anything about iPads? U mad bro?</p>
<p>Your comparison doesn&#8217;t really make sense on any level anyway, Apple makes only 2 iPads (maybe 3 in the future), and within the same series they are all exactly the same in terms of specs and features. Samsung literally makes hundreds of phones that aren&#8217;t even the same within their own series, and between series only differ .1&quot; in screen size or the shape of the speaker. Apple&#8217;s product strategy is the complete opposite of Samsungs: clarity, 1 size fits all, Apple decides what you can buy, vs: flood the market with millions of options, requiring buyers to either get a PhD in Samsung phones to figure out what their buying or just pray that they are getting what they were looking for.</p>
<p>Totally not mad, bruh! By starting out with an internet meme, I know exactly where your thought is going before even reading it. I didn&#8217;t realize that you were on Apple&#8217;s product strategy board. Exactly how many iPods do they have? How many iPhones do they have on the market &#8212; that essentially all look the same? There will effectively be three iPads come this holiday season, which again, all look essentially the same. Clarity? That&#8217;s as clear as mud. Look, bruh, whether it&#8217;s Samsung, Apple, HTC, whoever, the goal is to create products at different price points to meet consumer demand.  Talking of Ph.D&#8217;s, it&#8217;s the Apple products that just ran a commercial promotion touting the need for geniuses to use their devices. Look, my point is, Samsung is bringing its product line under one nomenclature, why is that a bad thing? You decry confusion. They&#8217;re trying to make it less confusing using one name. Which is it? Is this bad or good? Other commenters on this board are saying its bad, you&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s good?! U confused bro?</p>
<p>You should really try to relax a bit more and forget about the whole world vs. Apple obsession, there&#8217;s nothing to win here. This article is about Samsung phones, I give my opinion on the naming scheme Samsung used for it, and how I don&#8217;t like how Samsung is flooding the market with phones that are obviously made to trick people into thinking they are buying something much better than they are getting. This is not just my opinion, but a fact. I know 3 people who came home with a Galaxy SII ACE thinking they had a high-end Android phone. Two of them returned it within 6 months because they hated it so much.</p>
<p>Nobody ever mentioned Apple, the iPad or the iPhone but you, and all the &#8217;<br />
&#8216;arguments&#8217; you are bringing to this &#8216;discussion&#8217; are playing out in your own head.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called a simile. Using an analogy to make a point. People consider things with blinders on. This is an article about Samsung, but you see, there&#8217;s a whole, bigger world out there called &#8220;the mobile industry.&#8221; Of which, Apple, HTC and a slew of others are a part of. All of those participate in some sort of practice that hopes to put their product in the hands of a consumer, no matter the price point.  What I find hilarious is that, with nary a benchmark or hands-on, everyone&#8217;s jumped to a conclusion that this device is crap (including myself).  The ST-Ericsson U8420 isn&#8217;t necessarily a slouch. Dual-core, A9 clocked at 1GHz coupled with a Mali-400 GPU, 1 GB RAM (likely LP-DDR2). It&#8217;s no Tegra 3 or Exynos 4, but it might not be as bad as people think, considering it&#8217;s running JB and likely a 800&#215;480 res display.</p>
<p>Whatever the performance of that chip is, I can assure you it will not even be close to the SIII. This phone screams &#8216;just like all the other mid-range/low-end Android phones Samsung makes&#8217;. Calling it SIII mini really only makes sense in one way: by tricking people into thinking they are getting something really good, while they are in fact are getting something decidedly meh.</p>
<p>Maybe you are ok with this kind of marketing (nothing wrong with that), but personally, stuff like this disqualifies a product completely for me. If Samsung can&#8217;t come up with any other reason to buy this phone besides &#8217;it&#8217;s called Galaxy SIII&#8217;, then it is likely a piece of crap.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fine. This product isn&#8217;t targeted to you.</p>
<p>wow. Im really tired of people blindly defending a product that is subpar by sayig &#8220;It&#8217;s not targeted to you.&#8221; They acted like this phone woukd not conpromise on power by being shrunk down to 4 inches.  As its name infers, it is supposed to be a Galaxy S 3 just miniaturized. That is clearly not what it is.</p>
<p>The Galaxy SII variants at least made some sense (International variant, variant for LTE, variant for AWS, etc) and all had similar specs. This on the other hand is Samsung just slapping the Galaxy SIII name on something that&#8217;s closer to the Galaxy Ace/Galaxy S/Galaxy W. It&#8217;s deceptive and diluting the Galaxy S brand for a short term gain.</p>
<p>How is that different than ANY OTHER OEM in the market, including Apple? This is what businesses do. You make products people will buy. Clearly, they understand that there&#8217;s a market for this device. People will buy it in droves, like they did all of the other models. There&#8217;s a booming market for these kinds of phones in places like India for example. I see the &#8220;Mini&#8221; moniker to be completely in line with its competitors, from the likes of HTC and Apple. I can&#8217;t fault them for it. It&#8217;s good business. Those who know will buy the normal GSIII. There&#8217;s no confusion. Just like no one&#8217;s confused about what&#8217;s better &#8212; the iPhone 5 vs. 4S vs. 4.</p>
<p>The main difference between Apple and Samsung in this situation is that Samsung is releasing a new product that has middling specs, while Apple continues to sell what were previously high-end devices that have become mid-range and entry level devices over time. People aren&#8217;t arguing over whether Samsung is wrong to release a device with these specs in 2012, they think Samsung is leveraging the name of their high-end line and their current flagship to make a mid-range device more appealing. It seems more deceptive.</p>
<p>They are the only company who provides phones at every price point, every size.<br />
People who want these features will buy them.<br />
Atleast they are better than Apple and other companies who &#8220;Decide&#8221; whats good for the customer and shoves it down their throats. There is no choice.</p>
<p>If you dont like this model, move over.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called marketing strategy. Samsung believes in &#8220;flooding&#8221; the market with different phone models to hit their bottom line while others like &#8216;Apple and other companies&#8217; think differently. Don&#8217;t believe one bit that these companies &#8216;care&#8217; for consumers. All they care about is their profit margins, may it be Apple, Samsung, HTC, Microsoft, etc.</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t like Apple or other companies gadgets, just move over. You as the consumer still has the power to decide what&#8217;s good for you.</p>
<p>Mini already implies it&#8217;s not as powerful as the s3. It&#8217;s like saying s3 lite. Btw, besides the screen, it has the same specs as the galaxy nexus so it&#8217;s a solid mid range phone.</p>
<p>True besides the screen, but the screen doesn&#8217;t match up well with the midrange competition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see some benchmarks on the Ericsson chip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_sola-review-766p3.php" target="_blank">http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_sola-review-766p3.php</a></p>
<p>Thanks for helping a lazy man out.</p>
<p>No problem. It&#8217;s a decent chip for this type of phone. But damn, I just can&#8217;t get over the screen &#8211; it&#8217;s just plain at the bottom of it&#8217;s class at this point.</p>
<p>In keeping with the astral naming, they should call it the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy">DWARF GALAXY</a> S3.</p>
<p>And here I thought they were actually going to make a Galaxy S III Mini. Ugh.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said for a while now that the reason these companies go for bigger phones is not because they provide a better user experience. They do it because it&#8217;s easier to engineer a phone when you have more space. Because it&#8217;s cheaper to manufacture since less precision is required. Because it&#8217;s easy to get good battery life when you just cram a bigger battery inside instead of effectively managing power. If Samsung actually felt like exerting a bit of engineering effort they could absolutely fit something at least comparable to the full-size S3 in a four inch phone, but they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>That was a bit misleading wasn&#8217;t it? The CEO of Samsung saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re not making a low-end S3, just a Mini.&#8221; Turns out, it&#8217;s a low-end S3. Quel suprise?</p>
<p>Exactly!  What we need is OEMs to make smaller phones with all of the same high end HW fit into a smaller package.  So far it appears the Razr M is the best in class.  But it&#8217;s still lacking in some departments.  Was hoping for more out of this SG3 mini.</p>
<p>I hear u man! Hit the nail on the head. Laziness on Samsung&#8217;s part. F&#8230; em<br />
 I hope the nexus is more compelling</p>
<p>Looking at the spec sheet, this is purely a mid range/low end device that only serves to dilute the Galaxy S name.</p>
<p>Its actually quite smart move by Samsung in terms of business. People associate the galaxy S name with great phones, by including galaxy S3 in the name itself will trigger in some customers minds to purchase it, these will be the people that know less about smartphone hardware and will see this on a cheaper contract, it will also appeal to those that don&#8217;t want a giant phone. (even though the S3 is awesome.)</p>
<p>They associate Galaxy with great phones, the S was once reserved for the best in that lineup. But no longer.</p>
<p>that would be a little bit deceptive, is it not? Not illegal of course, but definitely cunning.</p>
<p>It looks like a white Nexus S with Touchwiz and a home button</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t they use the same specs with a smaller screen? I This thing is garbage.</p>
<p>Hows this any better than the over a year old Galaxy SII? Trying to boost the sales of a mid-range phone by passing it off as a smaller SIII. Pretty pathetic really.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what people were expecting? Samsung is running a business here. Do people seriously think that samsung was going to put something out that would undercut their flagship device? That is the problem with all fans, always looking at things from their point of vue and not the business side. Those companies are there for one simple reason, to make money, not to please you or I. Every once in a while things line-up and both the business and consumer needs are met, but those are rare instances</p>
<p>That would be all fair and well if Samsung itself hadn&#8217;t bigged up the device in precisely this fashion:</p>
<blockquote>Shin didn&#8217;t reveal many details about the device, though he said it was spurred by increasing demand for 4-inch devices in Europe. He also noted that it won&#8217;t be an entry-level handset, telling reporters it will have &#8220;full form factor.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/10/3482218/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-4-inch-jk-shin" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/10/3482218/samsung-galaxy-s-iii-4-inch-jk-shin</a></p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t say it was a high end flagship. He just said it isn&#8217;t low end which is correct as it has the same specs as the galaxy nexus.</p>
<p>Xperia U is a low end device with similar specs. Xperia P is a midrange device with a screen that isn&#8217;t 2 years old.</p>
<p>Size along would still make the GSG3 the flagship device.</p>
<p>The idea of a Galaxy S III with Galaxy S III internals at a 4&quot; form factor is very exciting, it&#8217;s what people want and Samsung wouldn&#8217;t undercut sales of the original GSG3. It would cut off sales of the iPhone because that&#8217;s what people but when they thing the GSG3 is just too big.</p>
<p>Now people can chose an inferior phone with inferior specs&#8230; or an iPhone. Don&#8217;t blame me when the mini S 3 flops.</p>
<p>Should be named Galaxy Ace pro or something not a S line phone. Boo.. Oh well GNote II or next nexus for me anyways.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t understand how you can call yourself a lover of all tech but hate on the companies that make some of the best tech products, i was expecting more from my fellow verge peeps.</p>
<p>Masquerading a low to mid range phone as a high end one &#8230; yeah why are people upset?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a nexus for you!</p>
<p>This is why I hate samsung, they put out feces like this, meanwhile the mid range phones like the One S and Razr M, will not get as many sales as this. Ruin the S3 name just to sell crap.</p>
<p>I fixed the relative sizes in the comparison with the S III and posted it <a href="http://www.modaco.com/page/news/_/android/alleged-samsung-galaxy-s-iii-mini-specs-and-image-leak-r802" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>P</p>
<p>Yea, this is dissappointing. If Motorola had phones available for every carrier in the US, the RAZR M is simply a better choice, unless screen-reachability is THAT important to you. At least the processing specs match the top end device. The same is the case with the HTC One S, but despite having the same screen size, it&#8217;s less compact a phone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost glad that all the phones coming out at the moment are as ugly as this piece of tat, makes me feel less bad about being stuck with a beautiful but under-powered Lumia 800&#8230;</p>
<p>in the end, this is only a leak. samsung has been a great company at keeping their secrets like during s3 &amp; note 2 launch.</p>
<p>let&#8217;s just hope this specs are not true</p>
<p>Still isn&#8217;t made very well.  GET A CASE. The back plate likes to pop off on my work S3. Hopefully the size will prompt a return to easier one handed use.</p>
<p>To be honest, it looks like a photoshopped picture of a Nexus S.</p>
<p>A mid-range phone, just like the new iPhone, right?<br />
/s</p>
<p>and how does this make sense next to the new Galaxy S Advance?<br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/android/GT-I9070HKABTU" target="_blank">http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/smartphones/android/GT-I9070HKABTU</a></p>
<p>Exactly my thoughts !</p>
<p>I seriously cannot even keep track of the different Samsung phones on the market. it&#8217;s all kinds of crazy.</p>
<p>Products like this is the reason Android has a bad name.  /facepalm</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>More fragmentation to their Market!</p>
<p>Except for running Jelly Bean, this is barely even an upgrade from the 2 year old 4&quot; Galaxy S.</p>
<p>And a downgrade from the SII, which is really what a midrange phone is today.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s another sign that they&#8217;re going to screw all their other customers who bought similar midrange phones running older versions of android. &#8216;sorry, no OS upgrades for you, but hey how about you buy a brand new phone with similar specs but we&#8217;ll put jellybean on it!&#8217;</p>
<p>The only thing I care about this release is the prospect the JB rollout for the GS3 might speed up.</p>
<p>Amen to that.</p>
<p>Really, Samsung?</p>
<p>800&#215;480, 1500mAh battery, no Exynos?</p>
<p>Sounds like a damn budget phone to me. They could have ate up a lot of the market if they released a decent 4&quot; phone with at least qHD, exynos cpu, and a 1800+mAh battery. </p>
<p>This (more or less) has already been done. Look at the Atrix: qHD, Tegra 2, and a 1930mAh battery, and that was almost two years ago!</p>
<p>Not to mention, how is this better than a Pantech Burst? You can get a Burst for $100 unlocked, NO CONTRACT:<br />

<p>Dual Core Snapdragon S3, LTE, 4&quot;, 800&#215;480 Super AMOLED, 1650mAh. Admittedly, no Jellybean on this phone &#8211; only ICS&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not seriously touting a Snap S3 device right?  At least this device is running the venerable Mali-400 GPU instead of the woeful Adreno 220 GPU.</p>
<p>The dual-core Mali-400 is fairly close to the Adreno 220. This processor is only using a single core Mali.</p>
<p>Not every phone released is meant to be flagship. It&#8217;s ok for manufacturers to make midrange models for those on a budget. That is, with your kind permission.</p>
<p>Except this phone wasn&#8217;t pitched as a &#8216;budget&#8217; device, but a smaller S3</p>
<p>hideous</p>
<p>Samsung has no clue what they&#8217;re doin</p>
<p>Oh wow that is terrible. Samsung has poor taste.</p>
<p>Great Samsung, way to get me excited and disappointed in such a short time.</p>
<p>This looks like any generic cheap crappy Samsung Android phone with the &#8220;Galaxy S III&#8221; brand slapped onto it.</p>
<p>What happened to the Galaxy R, W, M and Y series?</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t sell them for as much money as the S series.</p>
<p>my dad and sister bought the galaxy w three months apart. in those three months, the off-contract pricing had dropped by $100. within a few months, their phones were malfunctioning &#8211; both phones would random start vibrating endlessly, or the entire screen would light up and not turn off. sometime also while vibrating.</p>
<p>In addition to that they found out they couldn&#8217;t install apps like the kindle and yelp.</p>
<p>.. they were.. highly unimpressed. that&#8217;s putting it nicely. now my dad wants my mom&#8217;s iphone4.</p>
<p>Let me guess&#8230; no LTE either?</p>
<p>Oops.. this is a bad move by Samsung, especially if its actually called Galaxy SIII mini</p>
<p>Why would Samsung stage an event for low-mid-range phone? This makes no sense.</p>
<p>I saw the title and immediately thought, &quot;Finally! A high end Android phone with a smaller screen. &quot;. Then I read the specs and the display&#8230;</p>
<p>What the heck?  Someone needs to release a true high end 4&quot; Android phone with a great display.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to mask the platform deficiencies on smaller phones.</p>
<p>Well the reason there are android gigantophones now all over the place is &#8230; they can&#8217;t cram all their stuff in a small case.</p>
<p>It takes substantial design, manufacturing precision, and software optimization.</p>
<p>Hate on iPhone all you want, but them making ONE sole phone a year allows them to put all their efforts into this design; its admirable.</p>
<p>Bet it&#8217;s gonna get the shaft on updates.</p>
<p>I bet it&#8217;s never going to see an update.</p>
<p>badumTSCH</p>
<p>that&#8217;s pretty much the SOP for most midrange android phones. my dad&#8217;s phone bought in April this year (galaxy w) came shipped with gingerbread, and I don&#8217;t see it getting even an ICS upgrade.</p>
<p>Piecee of craaap pieceee of craaaaap. Not going to lie, was secretly hoping this would sway me from wanting to buy an iPhone 5, but it&#8217;s clear Android phone manufacturers are going down the wrong path for my purposes, so boohoo.</p>
<p>It takes greater engineering effort and there higher cost to produce a smaller phone. Samsung produces large phones because its cheaper to make with the higher specs. They can&#8217;t make a high spec smaller phone. Apple puts in alot of effort for their phones. Samsung cannot do it, so they go large.</p>
<p>As much as nobody likes to admit it, it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Smaller pones take more time to design, more precision in manufacturing, and much much more efficient software.</p>
<p>ST-Ericsson U8420 is like a ghost, there are no info to be found, does it even exist? Can somebody link me a site that even mentions that SoC?<br />
Even the Galaxy Ace 2 uses a SoC from the U8500 series and that sounds higher then U8420. I hope the Germans are wrong, but it really is Samsung style to do stupid stuff like that.</p>
<p>Samsung is confusing customers and diluting Galaxy brand. They should have separate names for low/mid/high end models. When I think Galaxy S3, I think high end &#8230; &#8220;mini&#8221; alludes to smaller screen but not a massive downgrade to mid-range. Those who think they are getting a smaller S3 will be disappointed. The worst thing, is that these low/mid range handset will probably never see an update to whatever comes after JB. At the end of the day, unsatisfied customers.</p>
<p>Thats why they have Galaxy W, and J, A, B or whatever the letter ever are&#8230;</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t mess with the S line if you don&#8217;t mean business!</p>
<p>Samsung really need to sort out their millions of phone variations. Unless the price is right why wouldn&#8217;t you just pick up the galaxy s 2.</p>
<p>Why should anyone buy this instead of the Galaxy s2 which retails at the same price? Yes, the display is +0,3&quot; bigger, but the CPU and the camera are so much better. Just put JB on the GS2 and it&#8217;s the perfect mid-high range Android phone out there&#8230;</p>
<p>true dat</p>
<p>Unless its under £200 but I can&#8217;t see that happening</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t sammy get rid of that darned button at the bottom??<br />
Every phone of theirs, other than the nexi, has it. Gives me the impression that they &#8216;want&#8217; to ape apple on the one button design thing.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve had the one button design for a while now even before the iphone was unveiled. Sad that Apple can do something and then everyone suddenly thinks Apple invented it and others who were doing it first are copy cats.</p>
<p>The whole &#8216;who came first&#8217; thing is entirely debatable, actually (&amp; unfortunately) &#8211; <a href="http://androidcommunity.com/who-was-really-first-apple-vs-samsung-story-truly-debunked-20110420/" target="_blank">http://androidcommunity.com/who-was-really-first-apple-vs-samsung-story-truly-debunked-20110420/</a></p>
<p>The design patent for the f700 was filed in 2006 and Samsung had many other 1 button phones before that. And usually they had a rectangular button which carried over until the s2.</p>
<p>Ugly as shite!</p>
<p>The Next Big &#8230; errr &#8230; Underwhelming Thing Is Here?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather buy an unlocked SGS2, root it and put JB on it than this thing. If it doesn&#8217;t have LTE, it would actually be worse than the outgoing 4S.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Galaxy Ace that doesn&#8217;t infringe on Apple&#8217;s trade dress. Nothing else to see, move along now.</p>
<p>Is this an example of the &#8220;innovation&#8221; that Samsung complains Apple is stifling? Lol</p>
<p>Great! If it happens as what is leaked so far, I&#8217;ll take one ^^ hope it cheap</p>
<p>My Galaxy S Blaze, which came out in March, has better specs than this. Same 4 inch AMOLED screen. Only thing these specs have on the Blaze is 16GB of internal storage.</p>
<p>This phone already came out the only difference is android 4.1</p>
<p><a href="http://m.samsung.com/cn/consumer/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/smart-phone/SCH-I699ZWACTC-features?subsubtype=android" target="_blank">http://m.samsung.com/cn/consumer/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/smart-phone/SCH-I699ZWACTC-features?subsubtype=android</a></p>
<p>This must&#8217;ve been the device used in Samsung&#8217;s latest Kung Fu ad. <a href="http://www.puppetshed.com/comedy/videos/samsung-ad-korea-fist-against-iphone-1977/" target="_blank">http://www.puppetshed.com/comedy/videos/samsung-ad-korea-fist-against-iphone-1977/</a> ;-P</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is why can&#8217;t they just update Galaxy S1/2 to jellybean and sell it at a lower price instead of releasing a new phone with entirely different processor and do testing all over again. This will help with their image along with streamlining their operation as well.</p>
<p>Wait &#8230; this will make people buy a new phone since it has a new name with similar internals as last year&#8217;s phone. I forgot they are a business that cares more about making money than providing a better product.</p>
<p>To add to my post above .. what I suggest above is what Apple has been doing all along.</p>
<p>But the problem is &#8230; at least with Apple, there was a hardware upgrade, no matter how incremental it was.</p>
<p>If the leaked specs is true and the hardware is what it is, besides the RAM, it seems worse than a SGS2.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not the high-end phone some were hoping for, I see. Figured Samsung wouldn&#8217;t do that for a smaller handset. It&#8217;s also really ugly, made worse by that hideous home button.</p>
<p>Dick move by Samsung.</p>
<p>They should really call this the Galaxy SIII Minus</p>
<p>Its simple why so many readers are pissed off. I like many others wanted a sg3 with smaller screen. That is all&#8230; what it sounds like samsung is delivering is a much down graded galaxy handset. Not the highend 4inch handset so many of us crave.. i see no vompelling reason to upgrade from sg2 to this. I am forced to go with a larger screened handset. Htc x + me thinks&#8230; or I pin my hopes and wait for the new nexus phone or phones.</p>
<p>I wonder why the changed the aspect ratio&#8230; maybe to play more nicely with more applications?</p>
<p>To save Apple&#8217;s lawyers &amp; The Verge from having to distort it in future comparison shots</p>
<p>Yes, yes, we know. Everyone (i.e. TheVerge, the jury, the American patent system, etc..) are totally biased against Samsung who, in turn are totally innocent. /s</p>
<p>troll</p>
<p>Yea, I can&#8217;t believe he responded to such an elaborate and convincing argument with that. What a troll!</p>
<p>Why, because I respond sarcastically to conspiracy theories?</p>
<p>They are bias.</p>
<p>Well played sir.</p>
<p>It was a joke</p>
<p>Samsung infringed Apple&#8217;s trade dress, that&#8217;s obvious&#8230; no under-hand distorting tactics from anyone needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Infringing their trade dress&#8221; sounds like a euphemism.</p>
<p>Even from the verdict only Galaxy S international version is found to infringe trade dress Apple claimed. Trade dress wasn&#8217;t that important issue here.</p>
<p>Not international version. There are two, Galaxy S 4G and Galaxy Showcase. My mistake.</p>
<p>Oh, alright. The tone was difficult to extract from mere text.</p>
<p>Removing /s will make your comment better.</p>
<p>To whom? People like you who actually believe that?</p>
<p>Well, so do you totally agree with the verdict?</p>
<p>Seems like it. When the original Note came out, the only devices with HD displays were the tablets that had 1280 &#215; 800 resolution, so Samsung probably went with that. But now even tablets like Nexus 7 are using the proper 720p resolution, so makes little sense to stick with the 800p resolution.</p>
<p>What? The Nexus 7 is 1280&#215;800. And there&#8217;s nothing wrong with 16:10 screens (well, maybe on a 10&quot; tablet&#8230;).</p>
<p>My bad. As for 16:10 displays, you get black bars while watching 16:9 content, such as the one shot from the phone&#8217;s camera. Also makes the device wider and not as easy to hold.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t most mobile camera capture in 4:3?</p>
<p>Yeah, but most of them are set to 16:9 mode by default to make full use of the display.</p>
<p>regardless, I like it.</p>
<p>I would hope that would be the reason, but if it were for that, I think they wouldn&#8217;t have done it from the beginning. It&#8217;s probably because the phone now has a larger screen, so at 16:9 5.5&quot; vs 16:10 5.3&quot;, the width is probably the same. So the phone won&#8217;t look &#8220;fatter&#8221;, just slightly taller.</p>
<p>And if they managed to do like with Galaxy S3 where they put a 4.8&quot; screen in a body that is as tall as the HTC One X with its 4.7&quot; screen, then it might not be taller than the original Note, either.</p>
<p>agreed</p>
<p>Nice! I want it. Launching with Jellybean is a big surprise!</p>
<p>Yeah. That is a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>I guess the PDK is actually paying off.</p>
<p>The new iphone will be released with ios6. What a big surprise!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of battery</p>
<p>Seeing as though Moto managed to squeeze a 3300mAh battery into the smaller Razr Maxx, this could have been bigger, imo.</p>
<p>So what is the difference between this and the GS3?</p>
<p>0.7&quot;.</p>
<p>Only time someone will be excited about 0.7&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what she said.</p>
<p>and the s-pen</p>
<p>This is bigger and has a stylus.</p>
<p>and a larger battery</p>
<p>And more RAM for multitasking.</p>
<p>Same amount of RAM&#8230;. As the US version</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from the UK.. And this is the International version which you won&#8217;t get till 6 months after the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Or if you follow the GS3 thinking, one to two months from now.</p>
<p>UK falls under international device list.  I got my international GS3 on the launch date</p>
<p>6? More like 1month like the GS3 :-p lmao . . . now go away</p>
<p>Well, some people like it bigger</p>
<p>Is that what she said?</p>
<p>Why is it called a Note? <br />
there is your answer.</p>
<p>4.1, larger screen, larger battery, stylus support, higher clock speed.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t they use a matte, black pastic?</p>
<p>Get a can of black sprat paint and some sandpaper.</p>
<p>Or spray paint, whichever.</p>
<p>I like the idea that somewhere someone has invented something called &#8220;sprat paint&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure it won&#8217;t take long before someone makes an aluminum backplate (just like how there is one for Galaxy S3).</p>
<p>Hopefully they&#8217;ll also release these running WP8!</p>
<p>WTF?</p>
<p>There is always somebody who plugs WP8 into any article, often with a low post count.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with that? I&#8217;d like to see a version of this running WP8. I&#8217;d buy that.</p>
<p>Speak of the devil&#8230;..and the devil shall <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/29/3276783/samsung-ativ-s-windows-phone-8-specs" target="new">appear</a>.</p>
<p>No stylus though.</p>
<p>Samsung note without the &#8220;Note&#8221; part, nor the big screen. i.e. nothing like it. Still a nice looking phone, but again an unnecessary/irrelevant plug.</p>
<p>Sue me for wanting to use the same OS across my future devices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll see you in court!</p>
<p>Windows Phone is crap, you can&#8217;t even set the search engine to Google.</p>
<p>ROTFL..Missing your bridge aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>And I would never  buy it if it has MS&#8230; I wont be buying from the evil empire, new or old version.</p>
<p>Yeah, certainly could do.</p>
<p>Awesome idea.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the Galaxy Note has any place on a website called &quot;Pocket&quot;Now</p>
<p>i see what you did there &#8230; and you are wrong !</p>
<p>They fit in a pocket.</p>
<p>&#8230;now</p>
<p>A Galaxy S3 that doesn&#8217;t know how to say no to a buffet.</p>
<p>One they call &#8220;Warren&#8221;.</p>
<p>NEED IT IN MY LIFE!</p>
<p>Looks gorgeous indeed!</p>
<p>64gb of storage, plus another 64gb on a micro sdxc card. That would be nice.</p>
<p>nice for what exactly? That is a little insane for portable storage on a phone.</p>
<p>You can never have enough storage.</p>
<p>Agreed.<br />
I sometimes use my phone to as a USB Drive for times I don&#8217;t want to carry USB sticks. The more storage, the better.</p>
<p>Same here, I always keep at least a gig open for the impromptu file transfer.</p>
<p>for his porn in picture watching while taking notes in class, duh!</p>
<p>offline mode on Rdio. My collection is sitting around 5600 songs</p>
<p>I have GS3 with 16+32 gb and yet I am left with 1.5 gb. And there&#8217;s not single porn or video on it. Beatles, Pink Floyed &amp; others in FLAC. 64+64 is perfectly sane &amp; it&#8217;s still not enough for me as I still have about 15 gb of music in my PC.</p>
<p>FLAC on mobile devices is doing it wrong. You won&#8217;t be able to hear the difference between FLAC and well-encoded compressed, lossy format.</p>
<p>I partially agree but I don&#8217;t want to have(or convert) multiple versions of a song. So flacs everywhere, though I still feel slightly positive difference between flacs &amp; 320kbps mp3. Specially when it&#8217;s connected to the car&#8217;s bose.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t use mp3 either, go for something like AAC/LC, it has a lot better compression, and can achieve much better quality than mp3.</p>
<p>Phone + hdmi cable + playstation controller = ultimate media experience.</p>
<p>PenTile&#8230;</p>
<p>So Note 3 next year&#8230;</p>
<p>1280&#215;600 5.8&quot; screen?</p>
<p>800 &#8211; 720 = 80 pixels less. So the Note 3 should have a 1280&#215;640 5.8&quot; screen.</p>
<p>By the same logic, the Note 11 released in the year 2021 will have a 7.4&quot; screen with 1280&#215;0 pixels.</p>
<p>Looks like an S3 after his wife left him and he gorged himself on hamburgers and alcohol.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>nice one</p>
<p>267PPI is a step backwards</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>Hope it has 2 gigs of ram and releases soon on Tmo. I know, wishful thinking.</p>
<p>It does have 2GBs of RAM</p>
<p>Thanks I missed that in my excitement. Fun fact phonedog uploaded a video of the Note 2 but it was taken down before I could watch it. The thumbnail was still in my list of subsribed videos on youtube.</p>
<p>I preferred the original.</p>
<p>The shape looks horrible.</p>
<p>It is just like the old Note&#8230;</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s taller and I believe the corners are more rounded.</p>
<p>the corners are symmetrical either.</p>
<p>the colour is horrible</p>
<p>I need this on Verizon and soon.</p>
<p><strong>drooooools</strong></p>
<p>Menu button though</p>
<p>Makes more sense until more apps are using Google&#8217;s guidelines</p>
<p>Or they could just use software buttons</p>
<p>Which would eat up a part of the screen and undo the reason for having the Note in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>Which would eat up a part of the screen</blockquote>
<p>Or, you know, they could make the screen longer.</p>
<p>The single home button on the phones front. Why would they deny Androids design suggestions and even step near an Apple iPhone design concept at this point?  It doesn&#8217;t make the phone look any better.</p>
<p>The S3 has a home button too&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard about these being released on Verizon (I think), but is there any word on a possible Sprint availability?  It seems like I heard that rumored somewhere but haven&#8217;t seen anything else about it.  And no, switching carriers is not an opition, right now lol.  I think I&#8217;d like to have a phablet and am looking at tee LG 4X US.</p>
<p>1280&#215;720 on 5.5 inch WTF?</p>
<p>Problem?</p>
<p>Love my Note running cm9 (waiting for assurances of stability on cm10).</p>
<p>For the Note II I&#8217;d have preferred no home button/capacitives, the original x800 res for the on screen buttons and an accordingly non-existent bezel.</p>
<p>It would be great if we could ditch touchwiz for the stock thing&#8230; Make a freakin` switch!!</p>
<p>If the hands-on  and reviews are  positive then I think I&#8217;ll be getting this, just in white.</p>
<p>This looks like a Nexus 7 killer!</p>
<p>Galaxy S III ripoff. Lol!</p>
<p>Thats what it is. Just a big S3 with a stylus and same resolution.</p>
<p>Yeah, the GS III team will sue the Note team.</p>
<p>I hope there is a notification led this time. I really miss it in my 1st gen Note.</p>
<p>Assuming the battery life is similar, the bump to 3100 is nice. I carry a spare and typically kill the first battery and about 20% of the spare, which equates to about 3000mah.</p>
<p>Confirmation yet of pentile/non-pentile? Can&#8217;t say it bothers me much on the og Note, leaps and bound better than pentile of old.</p>
<p>This one is Inspired by nature. Designed for <strong>robots</strong>.</p>
<p>Think this one was designed for Shaq</p>
<p>A bowl of water may have been somehow involved.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only had a GS3 for about a month and a half, and I already want to sell it for a Note II&#8230;</p>
<p>I waited for the S3 but then seduced by the Note, am back to waiting for  the Note ii, still carrying my CyanogenModded Captivate.</p>
<p>2 gig of ram, 64 internal and expandable with a microSD, LTE. and quad core. I was going to wait until they came out with an updated version for the S3 in the future but I wait can&#8217;t no longer. Gettin this before the year is over. Belee dat.</p>
<p>The note is already a big phone its hard for me to hold comfortably</p>
<p>I wonder at what size will they stop and say: yeah, that&#8217;s too big for a phone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an entirely new category of device:  Flibberdigibbet.</p>
<p>I used my Tab 7.7 as a phone briefly for a laugh. Conclusion &#8211; impractical.</p>
<p>nice try apple fanboy,  trying to disappoint us with the same s3 design, it&#8217;s NOT EVEN RUNNING JELLYBEAN in the render&#8230;</p>
<p>WTF are you on about?</p>
<p>Nice specs, but can it text and watch video at the same time?</p>
<p>Considering you can do that on every android device with a player like mobo, I would have to say yes.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t think Samsung products look pleasing in any way.</p>
<p>That screen is a whole inch bigger than my skyrocket.  I remember holding the original note wasn&#8217;t vey comfortable so I wonder how this will be.</p>
<p>Well, at least this&#8217;ll mean the Note 1 should be a lot cheaper. I can&#8217;t stand Nature UX and the whole SIII look of this new Note.</p>
<p>Unlike the gs3 this actually looks gorgeous.  My GNote is jealous.</p>
<p>EVERY ONE STOP THE GODDAMN PRESSES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Samsung has produced a successor of a device, which has a worse screen than the goddamn original version. I mean the screen is bigger, lower res and I am not seeing some kind of PLUS or what ever in the bloody artical. Samsung seems to have forgotten what they are; (internal) hardware supriorties. I don&#8217;t buy a Samsung for their looks, software, build quality or alure.  I buy a bloody Samsung, because I KNOW it is the most powerfull device device my money can buy, with (before the ONE X released for some (I like my satured colours)) the best screem.</p>
<p>Now they are fucking up EVERYTHING!</p>
<p>take a chill pill bro. it&#8217;s just a phone&#8230; er, tablet&#8230;</p>
<p>At least the home button is nice and centered. The low-positioned home button on the GSIII looks so horrible to me.</p>
<p>The image looks so grainy and pixelated in certain areas that it almost makes me think it&#8217;s photoshopped even though it&#8217;s probably not. Can someone get a clearer image?<br />
But as a side note, that Note looks beautiful.<br />
And launching on JB? It looks like the PDK is working its magic.<br />
BTW does anyone know if the pixel density is considered higher or lower since the aspect ratio changed?</p>
<p>Lower, 285 to 267. Doubt it&#8217;ll be noticeable though.</p>
<p><a href="http://pixeldensitycalculator.com/" target="_blank">http://pixeldensitycalculator.com/</a></p>
<p>Found a better, less pixelated image.<br />

<p>Dang, I was hoping that the Nexus 4 would be a 4 in. Nexus media player.</p>
<p>Why at all is it called &#8220;4&#8221; now?</p>
<p>The original Nexus was the Nexus One. Then came the Nexus S, then came the Galaxy Nexus. It&#8217;s technically the 4th Nexus phone.</p>
<p>Not the fourth Nexus though.</p>

<p>You appear to have just stated that the Xoom is a phone. Oh, and the Nexus 7 too. Well done.</p>
<p>And HTC Dream was certainly not a Nexus.</p>
<p>And even if he was considering the Dream as a Nexus, then why leave out the Sholes(Droid)?</p>
<p>its the nexus 4 for the same reason its the iphone 5</p>
<p>none</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going by the US phone models to make it simple</p>
<p>I thought they were going for screen sizes with their new notation of Nexus 4 &#8211; Nexus 7 &#8211; Nexus 10.</p>
<p>Sure the 4 is technically 4.7&#8230; but&#8230; yeah I don&#8217;t have a good defense there.  I&#8217;d actually like them to make a 4&quot; version and a 5&quot; version.</p>
<p>I would like them to give me all their products for free.<br />
I get the same feeling they&#8217;re not gonna do it :)</p>
<p>Haha me too.</p>
<p>However, according to Google:</p>
<p><strong>389.95 British pounds sterling = 629.18 US dollars</strong></p>
<p>Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>QUITE</strong> higher than the $350 Galaxy Nexus I bought.</p>
<p>Anyway, it doesn&#8217;t seem that much different.</p>
<p>Is it worth upgrading from the Galaxy Nexus to this, given the spec differences that we know so far?</p>
<p>Yeah, but it never really works like that &#8211; everything technology wise is just more expensive here in the UK. Examples:</p>
<p>iPad mini $329, £269. £65 markup versus direct translation of USD price into GBP, 24%</p>
<p>Amazon price of Galaxy S3 black unlocked = $556, or £391. Mark up of £45 when translating USD to GBP. 11%</p>
<p>Sony NEX 7 body only on Amazon, $1199 or £839. Mark up of £95 or 11%</p>
<p>Adjusting for average of above = 15% reduction = $535.</p>
<p>Obviously this is pretty finger in the air type calculation and probably won&#8217;t bear any relation to actual US pricing, particularly as I assume it will require different radio chipsets and therefore different marginal cost of production. But it shouldn&#8217;t be as expensive as $629.</p>
<p>British math is AWESOME!!</p>
<p>Remember sales tax (VAT) is included in the prices you see, and its 20%. That accounts for a lot of the difference, though there still is a built in buffer for foreign companies (like Google) to not have to take a hit if the exchange rate changes.</p>
<p>Also: UK cost of living is just generally higher, as its its minimum wage.</p>
<p>4.7 is a pretty sweet size. Not too big and still maintain a usable screen real estate when you need to take on screen buttons into consideration.</p>
<p>From the leak info of this phone, its size is very good!!! Thin, a bit narrow, a bit short, not too much loss on screen comparing to my S3.</p>
<p>The only problem is 8GB on board storage&#8230; and sealed battery.</p>
<p>No, too big.  Cannot operate comfortably with one hand.  If your thumb can&#8217;t pull down the notification bar without pivoting the phone, it&#8217;s too big.</p>
<p>I thought we stopped saying that when the iPhone decided to get longer but not wider.</p>
<p>The new iPhone <em>is</em> too big for some folks.  But that aside, 4.7 =/= 4.0.</p>
<p>They are calling it the Nexus 4 instead of the Nexus 5 because if they admitted how close in size this is to a tablet people would instantly realize what an obnoxiously big phone this is.</p>
<p>I laughed as much as anybody at the original &#8220;phablet&#8221; Galaxy Note shame train, but isn&#8217;t it about time to give it a rest? Let people make and buy what they want to make and buy.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there was a flagship Android phone that wasn&#8217;t tablet sized.</p>
<p>I have a GS3 and I can pull down notifications just fine without pivoting the phone and my hands are like baby hands.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so lazy to argue it any more.  Picture rules!<br />

<p>How can someone look at these things next to each other and not just buy the iPhone?</p>
<p>Thats like asking why everyone doesn&#8217;t just drive toyota camry&#8217;s. People like to have choices the best is subject to opinion.</p>
<p>You are telling me that you look at these two phones and in your mind the LG looks better than the iPhone? I was expecting someone to say something about not caring about looks or something.</p>
<p>Also, I don&#8217;t understand the comparison to a Toyota Camry. Please explain.</p>
<p>Wait, are you implying that the iPhone looks better? wow</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn&#8217;t look like a generic plastic piece of crap.</p>
<p>Because they do look at the price when they buy the phone!</p>
<p>The one with bigger HD screen and wirless charger only costs half of the price of iPhone. And it&#8217;s supported by Google directly, too!</p>
<p>People have different sized hands. Can we get over this whole screen size debate?</p>
<p>Sholes was not AOSP supported. Dream was.</p>
<p>Being AOSP supported is not enough to be a Nexus.</p>
<p>A Nexus is designed by Google. This is also why Xoom was not a Nexus. It was designed by Motorola.</p>
<p>Then how is this a Nexus?  Unless I&#8217;m mistaken, it&#8217;s the exact same as the new Optimus, just with a different exterior?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Nexus because Google said so.</p>
<p>Do people really not get it&#8217;s this simple.</p>
<p>The exterior is what&#8217;s designed by Google, they aren&#8217;t designing the internals because there&#8217;s no need.</p>
<p>Is it possible that Google jointly designed this phone with LG <em>as</em> they were designing the Optimus,  and LG just decided to keep the internals the same (presumbably with Google&#8217;s permission) to save on economy of scale?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wiresareobsolete.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/android-dev-phone-1.jpg" target="new">ADP1</a> was based on the Dream and could definitely be considered a member of the &#8220;Nexus&#8221; line. It was the Nexus before the Nexus existed.</p>
<p>and thus, by definition, not a Nexus.</p>
<p>Nexus 0</p>
<p>NEXUS.</p>
<p><img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120110021757/villains/images/0/08/Soran.jpg" /></p>
<p>Anyone else think that the phone in that screenshot looks more like a new <strong>Samsung</strong> Galaxy Nexus, rather than the LG Nexus phone that has leaked recently?</p>
<p>The nexii phones have kept consistent design language throughout. It&#8217;s well established through many leaks that it&#8217;s the LG nexus. Samsung&#8217;s nexus is a 10&quot; tablet.</p>
<p>I think some people would blow up a star to get timely Android updates.</p>
<p>oh god i was beaten to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once you go to the nexus, you&#8217;ll never want to come back!&#8221;<br />
<img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120110021757/villains/images/0/08/Soran.jpg" /></p>
<p>Poor misunderstood Soren.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newautoquote.us/ittwo/jusr.jpg" /> If i have&#8217;t bought a phone last month already, i&#8217;m so in on this.<img src="http://www.newautoquote.us/it2l/fnewd.jpg" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;re arguing the best point out of these two. Some people are arguing that it makes no sense (not likely), and you&#8217;re arguing that it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the 4th phone. Does that make the Nexus 7 the 7th tablet? I think it&#8217;s the screen size.</p>
<p>Nexus 4 &#8211; 4.7&quot;<br />
Nexus 7 &#8211; 7&quot;<br />
Rumored Nexus 10 &#8211; 10&quot;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see on Monday.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the 4th phone. Why include the tablets when we&#8217;re talking about phones??  If anything Google messed up when they named the nexus tablet</p>
<p>Because they&#8217;re branded the same. Doesn&#8217;t it make more sense that they use the same naming scheme for a brand of products?</p>
<p>Why people consume.. No one decides to not buy something because of the name.</p>
<p>iPod Touch 3rd Generation (makes sense)<br />
iPhone 3G (makes sense but the G means a different generation than the iPod)<br />
iPhone 3GS ( I get it add an S because its better)<br />
iPad 2 (where is the Generation?)<br />
new iPad (ok that was from left field)<br />
iPhone 4 ( so we are back to naming by numbers ok&#8230;)<br />
iPhone 5 (um this is the 6th iPhone if I count correctly)<br />
new(er) iPad ( I&#8217;m confused now)<br />
iPad Mini ( Nano sounds better than Mini but whatever)</p>
<p>Not one of those products follows the same naming guidelines</p>
<p>I thought the 3G was named that way because that was the first iPhone that Apple finally brought 3G connectivity to? That makes sense to me. It doesn&#8217;t seem to make sense to most of the people I encounter that own an iPhone. They THINK it means 3rd generation (even though it&#8217;s the second generation iPhone) and that&#8217;s why they almost always call a regular 4 a &#8220;4G&#8221;. And that was before the notification icon change.</p>
<p>The commenter above you wasn&#8217;t saying iPhone 3G was NOT named for 3G connectivity.  They were pointing out that iPods had, up to that point, been referred to as &#8216;iPod 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G&#8217; to denote their generation, which made it confusing.</p>
<p>What they missed, though, is that was never an official naming system employed by Apple.</p>
<p>With the exception of the iPod Photo, they always stuck with &#8216;iPod&#8217; as the name, and would parenthetically refer to the generation as needed only when it came to denoting accessory compatibility in the Apple Store.  Until, of course, they changed the product&#8217;s name to iPod classic.</p>
<p>iPods weren&#8217;t officially called iPod 2G 3G etc, only customers called them that, they were just iPods (or iPod Photo, iPod Color or iPod w/ Video) as they only sold one generation</p>
<p>&#8230;Did you not read my post?</p>
<p>Look, I was just being polite before.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re naming them all according to the screen size, it&#8217;s the only thing that makes any sense. They wouldn&#8217;t make a product line and then sell three products in the same generation, at the same time, with EXTREMELY similar names, and have the only distinguishing part of the name mean entirely different things for each product. One is screen size and the other is the number of devices they&#8217;ve put on the market in a specific form factor including some that had different branding?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a simpler, more concordant explanation. Occam&#8217;s razor.</p>
<p>The simple explanation is that it&#8217;s the 4th nexus phone. Nexus one, nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4&#8230; I think samsung probably forced them to add an S and a Galaxy onto their phones so they would have brand recognition (I doubt it was Google&#8217;s decision). The 4 being for the screen size seems like a happy coincidence that Google is taking advantage of to release their other tablets with a number correlating to their respective screen size.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight.</p>
<p>You think that it&#8217;s more likely that Google would suddenly decide to name phones after the rounded-<em>down</em> size of their screen, after never doing that before, than the possibility that they&#8217;d have a different naming scheme between phones and tablets?</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re arrogant enough in your certainty of that that you feel the need to say you were &#8220;just being polite&#8221; when you were actually discussing it with someone?</p>
<p>All right.  But if they come back next year and don&#8217;t call the phone &#8220;Nexus 4 II,&#8221; are you going to admit you were wrong?</p>
<p>Yes, and yes.</p>
<p>Care to explain the Nexus 7 and 10?</p>
<p>First of all,  I asked you three questions and you answered two.  I&#8217;ll assume, charitably, that you meant to lump the top two into one, rather than ignore the third.  But I&#8217;m curious nonetheleess.</p>
<p>Back to the topic, I am not certain that you&#8217;re wrong about the Nexus 4&#8217;s name (and I suspect that Google will never explain).  But it has been pointed out to you more than once, by more than one person, that Google <em>already has used</em> different naming schemes for the tablets and phones in the Nexus series.</p>
<p>No one has disputed the obviousness of the Nexus 7 and Nexus 10&#8217;s nomenclature.  What <em>I&#8217;m</em> disputing is your pointlessly arrogant certainty that Google <em>absolutely has</em> changed their naming system for phones suddenly to be exclusively about screen size (even to the point of being quite inaccurate for the sake of&#8230;who knows what?), but <em>absolutely would not</em> separate the naming scheme for their phones and tablets.</p>
<p>There haven&#8217;t been any other tablets in the Nexus series&#8230;</p>
<p>Then give me a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 6 FTW!</p>
<p>It could be both.  But it&#8217;s more like referring to the 4th generation.</p>
<p>If they follow the naming patter by the size, how will they name the next gen product? I don&#8217;t see the phone goes anywhere beyond 5 inch. So, they would it the next phone Nexus 4 II ???? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>great comment.  how is nexus 4 confusing for the 4th nexus phone?</p>
<p>lmao.. I was just thinking the same thing.</p>
<p>More like the 4th. You&#8217;re adding things that aren&#8217;t part of the Nexus line let alone PHONE line. What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>Well, if you count all flagship, trailblazing Android devices as Nexii, here&#8217;s what we see&#8230;</p>
<p>G1: 1 [HTC]<br />
Nexus One: 2 [HTC]<br />
G2: 3 [HTC]<br />
LG G2X: 4 [LG]<br />
Logitech Revue: 5 [Logitech]<br />
Nexus S: 6 [Samsung]<br />
Motorola Xoom: 7 [Motorola]<br />
Galaxy Nexus: 8 [Samsung]<br />
Nexus 7: 9 [ASUS]<br />
Nexus Q: 10 [Google]<br />
Nexus 4: 11 [LG]</p>
<p>What, no Motorola Droid? The first phone with Eclair and ran stock Android?</p>
<p>Because its a carrier-exclusive, carrier branded phone.</p>
<p>Only in the States&#8230;here in Canada and around the world it was the Milestone on many carriers&#8230;</p>
<p>Yep i know, it was released in the UK as well. But it had a locked bootloader.</p>
<p>So that double means its not a Nexus</p>
<p>The Motorola Droid most certainly did not have a locked bootloader. I had one.</p>
<p>Also, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus &amp; all have locked bootloaders. You can unlock them with installed via &#8216;fastbook oem unlock&#8217;</p>
<p>Nexus 7*</p>
<p>I would buy the Nexus Ampersand</p>
<p>Am I the only one who kind of wants to create a hoax device by this name now?</p>
<p>He is referring to the &#8220;international Droid&#8221;, the Milestone. This one definitively had a locked bootloader&#8230;</p>
<p>Only the GSM varieties (A853).  The CDMA Milestones (A854) were unlocked just like the &#8220;Droid&#8221; (A855)</p>
<p>Yes but the Milestone did. The Droid can&#8217;t be a Nexus because its carrier locked, carrier branded and carrier exclusive.</p>
<p>The Milestone can&#8217;t be a nexus because its bootloader is not unlockable.</p>
<p>That and it wasn&#8217;t part of the official Nexus program.</p>
<p>The HTC Desire Z (I think it was called the T-Mobile G2 in the US?) ran pretty much stock Android in the US (the UK variant ran sense) and wasn&#8217;t a Nexus device.  stock Android does not mean Nexus device, nor do it&#8217;s specs.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Haweii&#8217;s phones run stock Android, they are not Nexus&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Oddly, you&#8217;re adding non-Nexus branded devices to the list.</p>
<p>You forgot the Pandaboard. Everybody forgets it :&#8217;(</p>
<p>Christ, why are you trying to confuse people with this list? We&#8217;re not including tablets, no one was talking about tablets&#8230; This is obviously the 4th branded Nexus mobile device.</p>
<p>Nexus One<br />
Nexus S<br />
Galaxy Nexus<br />
???? <del>-</del>&#8594; (Nexus 4)</p>
<p>What we should be addressing is the ridiculous notion that someone thought it was ok to only include 8GB of storage with NO microSD slot&#8230; WTF??</p>
<p>It has been suggested that Google does this to limit the appeal of the Nexus hardware somewhat and to also make their OEMs happier.</p>
<p>Google making the rounds, selecting a few different manufacturers to build their &#8220;Nexus&#8221; lines allows Google to show the manufacturers how it&#8217;s done whilst simultaneously gifting the ecosystem with flagship standardised devices to benchmark and test off. Very clever!</p>
<p>This way they aren&#8217;t really alienating their OEMs the way Microsoft has done so with their &#8220;own&#8221; Windows 8 Tablets.</p>
<p>Google is a cloud company. They only make money when you use one of their services, so they are forcing you to store all your data on the cloud and use their services. I am ok with that if they release all the services world wide (Google Books, Music, Video, Maps, etc). Its not the case right now, except for US and some other lucky countries. I love Google, but 8GB or even 16GB is not enouh if you cant count on the &#8220;cloud&#8221;</p>
<p>Google is an advertising company.  They&#8217;re services are baked into Android no matter how much GB&#8217;s they have.  Trust me. They make money on Samusung Galaxy S3&#8217;s they have 32GB internal storage and 64GB sd cards.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah and one of the rumors is that there will be no LTE! This is not an upgrade to my nexus, sorry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ok, why not count all Apple phones as Nexuses, and while we&#8217;re about it I want to call my old Nokia 3210 a Nexus too.&#8221;<br />
That statement makes just as much sense as yours.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re just making stuff up, why don&#8217;t you add the iPhone 5 and Nokia Lumia 920 to that list.</p>
<p>Seriously, how and why are we doing this again?</p>
<p>Indeed, seriously, WTF. Who cares why it&#8217;s called what it&#8217;s called.</p>
<p>It is, so get over it and STFU!</p>
<p>This is joke, you&#8217;re being sarcastic rght?!? Cuz I&#8217;m seriously over here laughing. I could&#8217;ve swore I just saw Xoom.</p>
<p>You forgot the Nexus Q.</p>
<p>Stands up for the Nexus Questionable.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re just laughably wrong</p>
<p>HTC Dragon? Don&#8217;t you mean Passion :S ? Dream wasn&#8217;t a nexus phone, just a phone with stock android &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t classify it at &#8216;nexus&#8217;. There&#8217;s a phone called Geeksphone one that uses stock android, you wouldn&#8217;t call that a Nexus, would you?</p>
<p>I  see some people feel it&#8217;s their purpose in life to attempt to add nonsensical, useless confusion to any given conversation. It&#8217;s especially annoying when they try to present it as a correction or knowledge that deepens the conversation.</p>
<p>Though I disagree with your definition on Nexus for completeness you should have included the original Droid for Android 2.0 and maybe even the HTC Magic for Donut.</p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s not a Nexus the original Droid would fit your misguided list..</p>
<p>Shullbit.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re missing the Nexus Q.</p>
<p>Nexus 4 = LG Nexus 4&quot; Phone (4.7&quot; screen)<br />
Nexus 7 = Asus Nexus 7&quot; Tablet<br />
Nexus 10 = Samsung Nexus 10&quot; Tablet</p>
<p>But only 4 of those were nexus phones. The Nexus One, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, and the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>sometimes when people type things, we try to think about them before we hit &#8220;post&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe you can get yourself an equivalent to the &#8220;hear your post before you post it&#8221; like youtube/xkcd? Looks like you could use it.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t get to randomly rename non-Nexus devices Nexus devices. The G1 and Xoom were not Nexus devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZrzg62Zj0" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFZrzg62Zj0</a></p>
<p>And the Nexus 7 isn&#8217;t the seventh Nexus device either.</p>
<p>Nexus 7 is 7 inch</p>
<p><img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070526081822/uncyclopedia/images/thumb/1/15/CaptainobviousChooseOption.jpg/200px-CaptainobviousChooseOption.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="http://commonsenserepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/common-sense-is-tingling-221x300.jpg" /></p>
<p>Before reading the article I assumed it was a 4&quot; device (because the Nexus 7 denoted a 7&quot;) lol.</p>
<p>Nice price though!</p>
<p>Nice price? that&#8217;s almost $630 &#8211; 70 more then the SG3 and just 40 under the note 2&#8230; that&#8217;s way too much</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a brilliant price. The iPhone 5 is £749.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 is actually £529 for the 16gb model.</p>
<p>Even the most expensive (64gb) one is £699.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the UK gets shafted on this stuff. US price will probably be $549.</p>
<p>Still too rich for me though.</p>
<p>Look at the pricing of the new iPad mini if you want a comparison.  £329 in the UK for the base model &#8594; $329 in the US. British gov&#8217;t adds 20% VAT to the price and Google adds a bit on the exchange rate. The US price will likely be $399, look at how well priced the Galaxy Nexus is.</p>
<p>The iPad Mini base model price in the UK is £269.</p>
<p>The US price of $329 doesn&#8217;t include taxes.</p>
<p>Maybe when you convert it to USD from GBP, but over here for example the newly released iPhone 5 is £529 and when the Galaxy Nexus and SIII released they were in the £500-£549 range.  This, at least in terms of it&#8217;s price seems like a mid-high end rather than outright cream of the crop flagship device.</p>
<p>I agree that price of £389 does look nice to us in the UK. Still only 8GB though, which ain&#8217;t enough for a lot of people. If they had gone 32GB for that price then they&#8217;d be going gangbusters off the shelves (when they finally release it). Unfortunately I&#8217;ve got a horrible feeling they&#8217;re gonna sell a 32GB version for just under £500 &#8211; putting it in line with all other high-end Android phones.</p>
<p>I agree.  Hopefully they have more models with higher storage capacities.  Either way this is a very nice priced phone for a lot of people that will most certainly get all the updates too!</p>
<p>For real?! I do believe you missed the point.</p>
<p>I liked to think that it was a nod to Blade Runner, Nexus 7 being after the Nexus 6 model replicants. I guess not. :-(</p>
<p>C&#8217;mon, the novel is even called Do Android&#8217;s Dream of Electric Sheep.</p>
<p>Well, you can always keep thinking it. No one will think any less of you. I do promise.</p>
<p>That destroys the hope for more than one Nexus, what was the most interesting rumor in recent weeks&#8230;</p>
<p>Um, no. All indications point to a 10&quot; Samsung Nexus tablet (supposedly called the &#8220;Nexus 10&#8221;) being released as well. It seems Google is numbering their phones by iteration and their tablets by screen size.</p>
<p>Or the 4 is also a reference to the screen size &#8212; just the floor of the value. Because, let&#8217;s face it, &#8220;Nexus 4.7&#8221; sounds pretty dumb. I guess they could have called it &#8220;Nexus 5&#8221;, but then people would be expecting at least 5&quot; displays.</p>
<p>Reminds me of BMW&#8217;s model names, which used to line up with (Model)(Engine Size in Liters): the 325 was a 3 series with a 2.5 liter engine. Used to be very simple.</p>
<p>Then they started deviating a bit (a 4.8L engine in the 550), and now it&#8217;s hit or miss (the 328 has a 2.0L turbo, the 550 has a 4.4L, but the 320 is also a 2.0).</p>
<p>Long story short:  we&#8217;re all over-thinking the names too much.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also quad core.</p>
<p>So what would they name the 7th nexus phone?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m holding out for the Ocho.</p>
<p>I dont care what anyone says that was funny.  The Ocho <strong>slaps knee again</strong></p>
<p>F**kin&#8217; A, Cotton!<br />
<img src="http://i68.photobucket.com/albums/i25/OurHouseNJ/Dodgeball/c32fc368.jpg" /></p>
<p>They should call this the Nexus 5 and release an actual Nexus 4 with a 4&quot; or 4.3&quot; screen.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a name, not the basis of deep psychological thought, oh wait this &#8220;4&#8221; question will live on.</p>
<p>4&quot;, the nexus line is now named by screen size. (Nexus 7, Nexus 10)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a long list of dumb replies that just keeps on building over the assumption it involves generations. It has nothing to do with generations. They are following the Nexus 7 naming scheme, which has a 7&quot; screen. It&#8217;s for the screen size. The Nexus 4 is 4.7&quot; which isn&#8217;t quite 5&quot; so it&#8217;s called the Nexus 4. The rumored 5&quot; Sony made Nexus is dubbed the Nexus 5, the rumored Samsung tablet the Nexus 10 for it&#8217;s 10.1&quot; size. It&#8217;s not rocket science.</p>
<p>Ya&#8217;ll really blowing this out of proportion, it&#8217;s called the Nexus 4 because it is the 4th Nexus &#8220;phone&#8221;&#8230; Let us please not complicate what is already simple.</p>
<p>This is my next</p>
<p>mine too, if the build quality is okay :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m especially worried about the glass back, it actually seems like a huge stepback from the matte rubbery plastic on the G Nex (which creaks and squeeks every time I touch it, but at least I don&#8217;t have to clean fingerprints all the time).<br />
Glass will be easy to shatter and the optics seem really poorly defended from scrathes and so on. I&#8217;m still hoping they&#8217;ll show a Nexus from Sony or HTC that will have a metal unibody construction &#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve kept my phones in a bumper since my first smartphone, not to everyone&#8217;s taste obviously, but the tiny scratches &amp; scuffs that appeared on my iPhone were so annoying I&#8217;ve had one since, regardless of phone.</p>
<p>glass? i thought the back was made of plastic</p>
<p>It is plastic that looks like glass.<br />
There was a pic of a optimus G with a cracked back published last week , proved that it was some sort of plastic.</p>
<p>Glass is a step back from plastic? LOL</p>
<p>I bet you think Samsung makes great phones too. =P</p>
<p>Glass breaks a hell of a lot easier than plastic and conducts heat much easier as well.</p>
<p>well as i&#8217;ve never been physically burned by a smartphone, i would think the conducting heat would be a plus&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never had a smartphone get very hot in your hand from heavy use, or had to use a phone on a very hot day? Glass will heat up much quicker in both situations. In the opposite situation it will also get incredibly cold very quickly on a cold day, making it uncomfortable to use. Plastic is much more thermally neutral.</p>
<p>heat dissipation is needed for all smartphones, and it&#8217;s a double edged sword, but if it&#8217;s got something hot in there, glass is a better choice. (imo)</p>
<p>Of course you&#8217;d prefer glass, if apple made it out of paper you&#8217;d claim that was the best too. Shill.</p>
<p>Fail response.</p>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<p>No he prefers glass because its a better conductor of heat genius.  Do you even know what that means?  An object made of glass will be cooler than something made of plastic because it reflects better.</p>
<blockquote>You’ve never had a smartphone get very hot in your hand from heavy use, or had to use a phone on a very hot day? </blockquote>
<p>Honestly? Absolutely not. Never.</p>
<p>Is this an Android phenomenon?</p>
<p>What the heck phones do you use? Having used all iPhone iterations and several Android iterations, I have yet to find a phone that does not &#8220;overheat&#8221; at various times due to various factors.</p>
<p>I cannot count the amount of times my nexus s fell without breaking.</p>
<p>on the other hand, one of my friends had to send her iphone to repair the back glass four times.</p>
<p>not saying the nexus s has a better build quality (yes, its plastic, meh) but al least it can take a few hits without breaking to pieces</p>
<p>I cannot count the number of times my iPhone fell without breaking.</p>
<p>On the other hand my co-worker just had to replace the screen in his SGS-3.</p>
<p>Not saying that the iPhone has better build quality, rather that anecdotes aren&#8217;t terribly useful.</p>
<p>fair play to that, my bad.</p>
<p>All you have proven in your case is your friend is extremely clumsy.</p>
<p>But, but, but. Android fans said glass on the back was bad when the iPhone 4 came out&#8230;.I guess that changed?</p>
<p>People are complaining about the glass back&#8230;what does this statement even prove? Wow.</p>
<p>it better not have effin&#8217; glass &#8211; would be stupid (Galaxy Nexus owner that is going to upgrade to this and happy they chose the superior 8MP camera to the lame 13MP camera and also happy the the rumor is the back is acrylic)</p>
<p>Shut up, fanboy. Glass back is stupid on any phone, as many people here have said.  Go take your fanboy passive-aggression out somewhere else.</p>
<p>Me too! Great minds really think alike!! :-D</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read from a few of those earlier leaks that the back is some form of treated plastic that looks &amp; feels almost like glass. I, too, had that worry but trust that rumor. We shall see. The also said the rim if the body is rubberized plastic, so that also is a welcome change to me. Can&#8217;t wait for the official reveal.</p>
<p>I think the Optimus G has a glass back which means this likely does as well.  It&#8217;s basically the same phone.</p>
<p>I hated the square-ish design of that thing though, lol. Apparently the Optimus G came is pretty damn awesome, so I am hoping for the same with the Nexus . The leaked photos supposedly taken by it were depressing, in quality and may be a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>It might be a poly-carbonite.  That&#8217;s what some of the LG Optimus G reviews have said.  I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s not glass as well.</p>
<p>It will not be my next if the storage assumptions are correct.  Cloud is nice, but 8GB and no SD is a fucking FAIL.  Especially with outrageous carrier data costs.  I don&#8217;t want to stream all my music from the cloud and burn up my limited data.  I want more than a couple of games installed at a time.  I want plenty of room to shoot pix and videos.</p>
<p>8GB ain&#8217;t gonna cut it.</p>
<p>I want to rub this all over my face and body.</p>

<p>I hope we have an updated gif.</p>
<p>Wow,  that phone is as greasy as a bucket of crisco now</p>
<p><a href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/10/17/study-1-in-6-cell-phones-contaminated-with-fecal-matter/" target="_blank">http://healthland.time.com/2011/10/17/study-1-in-6-cell-phones-contaminated-with-fecal-matter/</a></p>
<p>Josh? why&#8217;d you change you&#8217;re name?</p>
<p>8gb?</p>
<p>Enough for 3 games, an mp3 album, and 2 minutes of HD video. What more can you want in 2012?</p>
<p>Or two WMA albums!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s to keep the price down.  I&#8217;d also be willing to bet they&#8217;ll have a 16gig as well, but a little later.</p>
<p>There better be a damn microSD card slot or &#8230; EPIC FAIL.</p>
<p>My desperate hope is that this is all planned leakage from Google and LG in a brilliant Machiavellian plot to cover up the real multiple nexus phones&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m holding out for a unicorn skinned back too&#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also my next.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to love this device.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, alas, they f**k it all up w/8GB OBS.</p>
<p>Can we get an update on this article regarding SD expansion?</p>
<p>8GB for a flagship phone is massive failure if there is no microSD.  Google can&#8217;t be that dumb.</p>
<p>1) The Nexus platform has always been about pushing Android to where Google wants to take it, not necessarily what customers want right now.</p>
<p>2) Google HATES microSD slots. This will not come with one, period.</p>
<p>3) It may also come in a 16 GB version, but that&#8217;s not really the point.</p>
<p>4) Google wants you to live in the cloud. Its cloud, specifically.</p>
<p>5) The new Chromebooks come with 100 GB of free Google storage for 2 years.</p>
<p>6) I&#8217;ll be stunned if the 8 GB Nexus doesn&#8217;t also come with cloud storage, and Jelly Bean upgrades to make that cloud storage work as if it was local.</p>
<p>7) If Google&#8217;s feeling really cheeky, they&#8217;ll only include the free cloud storage on the 8 GB device to make a point about how little local storage you really need.</p>
<p>And I should add:</p>
<p>8) All that is well and good for Google&#8217;s grand vision, but pretty shitty in a world with 2 GB monthly data plans.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love 100GB of cloud storage&#8230;. If I had LTE data covering 100% of the area of the planet and an unlimited data plan&#8230; SHIET i guess that&#8217;l never happen.</p>
<p>Forgot to add: with only 8GB of internal storage.</p>
<p>With 8GB onboard?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a tough sell. Unless 4.2 blows my mind, I think I&#8217;d rather go Note 2 or wait for the rest of the rumored Nexus devices.</p>
<p>Only gripe i&#8217;d with it is the internal storage. 8 GB is a deal breaker for me (unless a 16 GB version exists, which is the absolute minimum for me).</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus and 16 GB is NOT enough. If you have any sort of music library and want to go on trips anywhere where you may not have data (mountains, fields, abroad) it sucks&#8230; a lot!</p>
<p>With only 8Gb storage? No thanks.</p>
<p>Please have a 4g model available.</p>
<p>Probably not, unlocked at least. LTE is way too fragmented.</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t the galaxy nexus have 4g? I mean if the iphone has finally got it, surely android&#8217;s nexus will have an option?</p>
<p>There was no unlocked LTE model, only the Verizon model. If there is an LTE version, it will be tied to a carrier.</p>
<blockquote>There was no unlocked LTE model, only the Verizon model. If there is an LTE version, it will be tied to a carrier.</blockquote>
<p>If Google are planning a world-wide LTE version, (like Samsung, Nokia and HTC) then no.</p>
<p>No one has a world wide LTE version device.</p>
<p>Nokia 920 works on LTE in Asia, Australia, Europe and Africa I think.</p>
<p>US would needed another 5 or so bands.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I mean. There isnt one device that also cover all US carriers LTE</p>
<p>And there isn&#8217;t a 3G phone that does that either!</p>
<p>Its not a manufacturer problem, its a US problem.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus is pentaband (850/900/1700/1900/2100 MHz).  It works on AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and in every country I can think of.  But it&#8217;s definitely the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Only the one sold on the Play Store is Pentaband, the one sold in retail stores (the original version from day 1) is Quad-Band.</p>
<p>I think you are wrong. Citation?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus#Variants" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus#Variants</a></p>
<p>&#8220;GT-i9250 &#8220;Maguro&#8221;: GSM/HSPA+ variant. Features support for both AT&amp;T&#8217;s and T-Mobile&#8217;s HSPA+ bands in the United States. This particular variant is currently sold SIM-unlocked by Google in the Play Store.<a href="#fn56">56</a>&quot;</p>
<p>Whilst the original model was quad-band. <a href="http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Devices/Samsung/Galaxy_Nexus/Black?s_search=prodsearch" target="_blank">http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Devices/Samsung/Galaxy_Nexus/Black?s_search=prodsearch</a></p>
<p>Scroll down to bands.</p>
<p>Simply not true. I have imported the UK version of the phone and used it on T-Mobile&#8217;s 3G bands in the US when it first launched. The UK and US GSM versions have the exact same hardware inside. There might be customization done to the software builds, but you can flash the Google recovery image once you unlock the bootloader.</p>
<p>My bad, the reply was directed @ MrLadoodle.</p>
<p>thank you for correctly using the word than and not then. (yes it has to be thanked nowadays)</p>
<p>so worldwide means USA to you?</p>
<p>Uh, no, but since USA is part of the world, a &#8220;worldwide LTE version device&#8221; would have to cover it, and it doesn&#8217;t, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>Reading comprehension failure.</p>
<p>Wow. I didn&#8217;t know this.<br />
It would actually be really awesome if they released a global GSM model, an Asia, Australia, Europe and Africe LTE model, and then left it up to the US carriers to sort out their LTE mess.</p>
<p>Dunno about that. Canada and AT&amp;T share the same LTE spectrum so pretty much every US LTE device has come here, I&#8217;d like to keep it that way please :)</p>
<p>Well, you just need to make 2 versions to support most carriers&#8217; LTE network.</p>
<p>1. LTE (Bands 4 and 17)<br />
2. LTE (Bands 1, 3, 5)</p>
<p>Sorry,  I didn&#8217;t count Verizon in since I believe they just don&#8217;t deserve a Nexus phone over again!!!</p>
<p>Me thinks you&#8217;re correct.  they could pull an Apple and use a multi-mode chip, but probably not to save on costs.</p>
<p>Sprint as well.</p>
<p>Nokia did it for the 920.  HTC did it for the One XL and X+.</p>
<p>Not Unlocked for US carrier LTE. Non of the US LTE networks are compatible. You&#8217;ll have to get one from the carrier for that&#8230;if available.</p>
<p>But they do exist in the world, and will end up like 3G.</p>
<p>This might have a LTE compatible chipset, but its not advertised in the UK since Vodafone and o2 don&#8217;t have LTE networks, but wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it did support LTE and supported the same bands as the XL or 920.</p>
<p>So you could get it unlocked and then get a contract on EE, T-mobile or Orange?</p>
<p>If it supports LTE and the correct band (which it should) then yes.</p>
<p>Although EE&#8217;s SIM-only LTE requires a 12 month contract.</p>
<p>Yeah that would be fine, i don&#8217;t mine a 12 month contract for the sim. As long as the phone can use 4G.</p>
<p>mind*</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t care about LTE for now, it&#8217;s so F&#8217;d up in the UK thanks to the regulators</p>
<p>EE will take 2 years to roll it out beyond the cities, (other networks will obviously be later than that) during that time ThreeUK&#8217;s DC-HSDPA+ will run just about as fast and have better coverage.</p>
<p>Eh i live in London so i don&#8217;t mind if i have 3g outside of it.</p>
<p>Its not that fucked up, and by late 2013 will be un-fucked up. But best waiting for Three&#8217;s or o2&#8217;s LTE.</p>
<p>A 12 month contract is fine. By that time i can see all the other offers available and switch if necessary.</p>
<p>Probably cheaper and better to just stick with Three for a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on t-mobile. £24 a month for &#8220;unlimited&#8221; internet. so 1gb.</p>
<p>Oh really? My plan is £26/month on Tmobile and was advertised as &#8216;1.5gb of internet&#8217;. It wasn&#8217;t advertised as unlimited.</p>
<p>Did you buy your contract a long time ago? I remember that&#8217;s how they used to advertise it.</p>
<p>yeah, when the first desire came out.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t be on EE, or the comprising networks. Just that Car phone warehouse aren&#8217;t selling it o those networks right now</p>
<p>I read this as:</p>
<blockquote>Please have a <strike>4g </strike> <em>4GB</em> model available.</blockquote>
<p>I nearly flagged you for trolling&#8230;  :P</p>
<p> Well .. hey .. why not?</p>
<p>Most likely HSPA+ only</p>
<p>SIM only price from Carphone Warehouse is £389.95</p>
<p>Instabuy</p>
<p>Really hope the rumor USA price is 399 so i can sell my SGSIII, CM10 is not working properly on it. Wi-Fi keeps dropping, but stock rom works perfect. I need a powerful Nexus in my life and this is it, don&#8217;t mind the 8 GB storage so much, but mad at Google because a lot of other people want bigger options.</p>
<p>CM10 just hasn&#8217;t really managed to get going or make the impact that CM7 did. It&#8217;s such a shame.</p>
<p>AOKP JB Build 5 came out a couple days ago, and it runs well.  I&#8217;ve had no crashes or erratic behavior.  Keep an eye on your battery though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running ParanoidAndroid on my S3, which is based off CM10 and haven&#8217;t run into any crazy issues.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s only cos the storage space is 8GB, if it was 16GB, it would probs be in the £450 mark again like the previous Nexus devices were.</p>
<p>Free from £31 a month, which is actually very good.</p>
<p>Will be even better through cut price online deals</p>
<p>They learned from the dismal failure with pricing the GN at £41/mo when it launched</p>
<p>Yeah, that was never going to fly.</p>
<p>Pretty good starting point, yeah. Sure we&#8217;ll see it drop to around £26 with small upfront cost in a matter of weeks though. Like, S3 for example is £27/month +£49 upfront on Orange at CPW, down fromt like £41 at launch</p>
<p>Worth noting that the £31/month tariff gives you no data &#8211; so you need the £33/month for 500MB and £36/month for 1GB.</p>
<p>If you bought the phone upfront for £389.95 and had a £10/month SIM only deal (see GiffGaff), then you start saving money after 19 months (vs £31/month), 17 months (vs £33/month) and 16 months (vs £36/month).</p>
<p>Over two years, TCO will be  £629.95 (upfront + SIM only),  £744.00 (£31/month), £792.00 (£33/month) or £864.00 (£36/month).</p>
<p>Plus your unlocked phone will have a much higher re-sale value on eBay.</p>
<p>As with most big purchases, if you can afford to buy outright then it&#8217;ll save you money &#8211; in this case, up to £234 over the space of two years.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the price of Galaxy Nexus in UK?</p>
<p>£450</p>
<p>It never got reduced in price, it flopped.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Devices/Samsung/Galaxy_Nexus/Black?s_search=prodsearch" target="_blank">http://www.three.co.uk/Discover/Devices/Samsung/Galaxy_Nexus/Black?s_search=prodsearch</a></p>
<p>So it seems like it would be sub $400 in US.</p>
<p>Take our 20% VAT off the £389 then do a currency conversion</p>
<p>stuff is often a bit dearer here than even that, not sure on mobiles though as we have a super-competitive market, but Carphone are rarely the cheapest once supply opens up properly.</p>
<p>the guy is smoking crack&#8230;it is £293.30 in stock at amazon.co.uk</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B005XYU45E/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&condition=new" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/offer-listing/B005XYU45E/ref=dp_olp_new?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=new</a></p>
<p>The galaxy nexus has been available for £300 for quite some time now&#8230;</p>
<p>Ah maybe Three didn&#8217;t drop the price, but I still see it listed at £400 in some shops.</p>
<p>Wrong to look through a network outlet&#8230; It&#8217;s from <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?hl=en&safe=off&pwst=1&q=galaxy+nexus+sim+free&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&bpcl=35466521&ion=1&biw=1600&bih=775&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=8313295832575533976&sa=X&ei=EBuJUO7RDcXT0QXe1IDoBA&ved=0CEIQ8wIwAQ" target="new">£200 online</a> and that&#8217;s just a quick Google, not a proper search.</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>
<p>Wow. That&#8217;s actually quite tempting.</p>
<p>Thats just crazy in Italy u can find it for 250-270 euros in special offers</p>
<p>It was withdrawn months ago (when the GS launched) &#8211; the prices you see online are old stock.</p>
<p>Explains it, thanks!</p>
<p>Arround £440 on contract in UK. Cheaper if you can be bothered with the cashback: <a href="http://www.comparemobiledeals.com/mobile-phones/Samsung/Galaxy-Nexus" target="_blank">http://www.comparemobiledeals.com/mobile-phones/Samsung/Galaxy-Nexus</a></p>
<p>Im gonna wait it out for a month or two as it&#8217;ll drop if the sales levels arent good. Im gonna be pretty miffed if this isnt uk lte compatible.</p>
<p>Wow. That&#8217;s a bargain and the contract price is very aggressive too.</p>
<p>I wonder if that means $389.95 in the USA&#8230;</p>
<p>£389 is £312 without 20% VAT on it&#8230; Currency conversion brings that to about $500 I think.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget this looks like an entry level 8GB model, will be sure a 16 &amp; maybe 32 would be more.</p>
<p>Yeah, but when in the history of technology have prices in the UK been roughly the same as prices in the US? Most manufacturers just take the £ off and put a $ on.</p>
<p>Yeah, this seems to be the case.  £=$ when it comes to tech.</p>
<p>Yea didn&#8217;t the same  happen with the Nexus 7?</p>
<p>Round about &#8211; £159-$199.</p>
<p>Oh okay thanks, fingers crossed for the 8 GB being 399, really want to sell my GSIII for a good price have money left over when getting the Nexus.</p>
<p>most likely comes with sd card slot .</p>
<p>A Nexus device will never have an SD card slot, they stopped it from the Nexus One and have said they won&#8217;t put it back in</p>
<p>Btw 20% of £389 = £325</p>
<p><img src="http://static4.fjcdn.com/comments/Can+t+tell+if+bronies+have+gone+too+far+or+if+_19489ea77a01940be313e3550e84eac7.jpg" /></p>
<p>Can&#8217;t tell if typo &#8230; or bad math.</p>
<p>Nah just bad spelling *off</p>
<p>Try adding 20% to 312 and you get 374 not 389.<br />
Now try doing it to 325</p>
<p>I get 324.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not 20% off £389, by the way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 83.3% recurring of £389, or 16.6% recurring off £389.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty good price. The GNex is still almost that much here.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bloody good price.</p>
<p>Oh dear, naughty Carphone Warehouse!</p>
<p>Weren&#8217;t those guys also responsible for leaking the GS III?</p>
<p>Most likely. They are really bad with leaks.</p>
<p>I found out about the Nexus S in the August before it was launched as I was working there.</p>
<p>do you want to be friends?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re pretty important, so I expect they get away with these sneaky manoeuvres as you can&#8217;t very well sell in Europe (they also part own Best Buy) I think, without them on board.</p>
<p>Carphone is Europe&#8217;s largest mobile retailer &#8211; They also own lots of seemingly rival cheaper, cut price, high volume websites.</p>
<p>They split the company in two to keep TalkTalk (the phone/ISP/TV provider) separate and Best Buy bought a 50% share in what was left so as to get a foothold in in the UK/EU market with a view to rolling out stores, but obviously that went pairshaped within a year and they&#8217;ve closed them all down, so it&#8217;s now just a jointly owned retailer/distributor under the Carphone brand.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t part own BestBuy. BestBuy Europe was a joint venture between BestBuy and CPW but it has now been discontinued (it failed miserably)</p>
<p>Ah, I stand corrected. Thanks.</p>
<p>I looks like they just copied a screenshot from the very dubious leak of yesterday, wrote likely specs and are using them to get some preorders&#8230;<br />
This really does not look like an official render of the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>Nice phone but&#8230;not ditching my Galaxy Nexus for this.  MAN I hope those rumors about a Sony Nexus are true.</p>
<p>No, they were proved to be fake&#8230; The guy showed how he faked them and said he did it to get people talking about a Sony nexus in the hope it will happen in the future</p>
<p>You could have let me dream man!!</p>
<p>Me too</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>A UK Sony Exec <a href="http://www.androidgenus.com/news/phone-news/no-xperia-nexus-according-to-sony-md/" target="new">publicly stated</a> that a Nexus device would go against Sony&#8217;s marketing strategy.</p>
<p>I think that this comment was more targetting their normal xperia phones that will continue to have a skin.<br />
Sony is already a part of the Nexus program : the xperia play would have been an official nexus phone if Sony had been able to launch it sooner.</p>
<p>I interpreted to specifically poo poo a Nexus branded phone. I know they are part of the Nexus programme itself&#8230;</p>
<p>At the same time he&#8217;s alluding to stock Android getting closer to what they want by incorporating their changes.  So since he specifically mentioned stock ICS not working with their marketing strategy the may not close the door for a future version of Android.</p>
<p>Using the fake screenshot from yesterday?</p>
<p>Yap</p>
<p>You mean this &#8216;fake screenshot&#8217;?<br />
<a href="http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/mobiles/mobile-phones/LG-NEXUS-4/MONTHLY" target="_blank">http://www.carphonewarehouse.com/mobiles/mobile-phones/LG-NEXUS-4/MONTHLY</a></p>
<p>Yes. This exact same screenshot (with the notifications from non Google apps, and the centred clock and battery bar showing percentage [both iconic features of the AOKP custom ROM]) was leaked yesterday, and is clearly fake.</p>
<p>Just because carphone warehouse took it an put it on a product page doesn&#8217;t mean that the photo isn&#8217;t very clearly fake.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&postcount=416" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&amp;postcount=416</a></p>
<p>Ha! Actually ganked from XDA!  Hilarious.</p>
<p>Omigosh, this is brilliant!</p>
<p>Hmm this is that render which everyone thought was fake. The clock is in the middle, there&#8217;re third party temperature notifications, and it&#8217;s showing Google now on the home screen.</p>
<p>Its also showing things on the screen which are very US specific, and this is a UK site.</p>
<p>You mean it has the google now app open&#8230;?</p>
<p>Google Now will NOT replace the android homescreen if thats what you&#8217;re suggesting&#8230;</p>
<p>It says live updates &#8216;on the homescreen&#8217; on the desctiption.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that the fact that it&#8217;s now on a reputable website says anything about the veracity of the image.</p>

<p>Note from the specs, the resolution is 1280 &#215; 768 px</p>
<p>worst product launch ever. the device may be good, but i miss the suprise effect.</p>
<p>Man&#8230;when have you ever been surprised by a device launch in the past couple years? Everything leaks.</p>
<p>samsung and htc made a pretty good job. it seems lg doesn&#8217;t even try to be discrete about this phone.</p>
<p>Nexus Q?</p>
<p>Yep. The only one I can really remember. And it didn&#8217;t really launch well, did it.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really launch</p>
<p>Microsoft Surface.</p>
<p>I really want a  Nexus phone&#8230;but I don&#8217;t think I want it to be made my LG.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the fence.  All their previous phones have been bogged down with their crappy skins. On the other hand, my dad works in construction and had an LG Ally that took a serious beating before giving up the ghost. I was continually amazed that the thing kept running. Had to respect it.</p>
<p>Huh, that page shows 8 GB storage</p>
<p>No Micro SD slot also</p>
<p>No SD on a Nexus device isn&#8217;t a surprise now is it? Google wants you to use Google Play to get your reading &amp; viewing content as well as using it&#8217;s Google Plus for photos, YouTube for video and Drive for anything really.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s still easy to get content from elsewhere on it, the lack of SD streamlines the process to use Google for content delivery and of course storage.</p>
<p>Due to the low internal storage I thought they would think of providing a expansion slot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be certain 8GB won&#8217;t be the only model, will find out in 4 days at the most, less if there&#8217;s more leaks.</p>
<p>No SD is fine, Nexus phones never had it. But 8GB? WTF? not to mention that of the 8GB, most likely only 6GB is usable. Seriously Google?</p>
<p>16GB with 13.3GB usable on the GNex was bad enough, not to mention that canceled 32GB international GNex. I really hope that theres other storage options for the N4.</p>
<p>The Nexus One had SD Storage.  The Samsung nexus phones did not.</p>
<p>The Nexus One also only had 512 MB internal storage. It was a joke. Also came only with a 4 GB sd card of i recall correctly.</p>
<p>Yeah, 512 filled up real fast.  Thank goodness you could format your sd card to ext3 and use DarkTremors A2SD and symlink the phone memory to the ext3 partition on the sd card.  That brings back a lot of memories of flashing CM nightlies and flashing DT right afterwards  :)</p>
<p>It seems that Google REALLY wants people using the cloud. But you can&#8217;t install games on the cloud, can you? What an epic fail. I feel sorry to whoever I told to wait for this phone.</p>
<p>not even america have decent 4g signals or fair unlimited plans&#8230;.</p>
<p>music streaming its out of place on mobile unless everyone live in japan or korea where bandwidth and carriers have decent coverage and speed</p>
<p>Ugh. I don&#8217;t mind non-expandable storage as long as there&#8217;s enough of it, and 8GB is nowhere near enough.</p>
<p>Whoever okay&#8217;ed 8GB on a flagship device at the end of 2012 should be taken out back and shot.  I&#8217;m sure they will have larger versions but 8GB now is a joke.</p>
<p>i use my blackberry 9300 with my stock 2gb micro sd&#8230; but yeah 8gb with no expandable option its stupid choice&#8230;</p>
<p>How anyone can say &#8220;this is my next&#8221; about a phone that has this amount of storage w/ no microSD slot is kinda, well&#8230;interesting, considering the site that we&#8217;re on. A tech person that doesn&#8217;t require any physical storage.</p>
<p>Exactly, my thought.  I can stand the sealed battery. No LTE? Sure. but 8GB for internal storage and no expandable storage???? No way I will give up my SGSIII than comes LTE, swappable battery and the 64GB microSXDC support.</p>
<p>In the specification section on the mobile site it says n/a</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> its showing 8 now&#8230; hmmm so it&#8217;ll be ~5GB</p>
<p>And confirmed 8GB</p>
<p>If you read the specifications carefully it actually says &quot;Android OS, v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) &quot;.</p>
<p>On the specifications page it says 4.1.2, but everywhere else it says 4.2.</p>
<p>Agree,  typo I think. I guess we&#8217;ll find out on the 29th..</p>
<p>This WON&#8217;T be my next. Why you ask? Because of the number 8.</p>
<p>You assume this is the only model, with it still being 4 days until the announcement?</p>
<p>Seems weird.</p>
<p>WP8? /s</p>
<p>Nah. No one would do that&#8230;</p>
<p>I think he means he has $8 in his bank account. So Jealous.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have Google Music?</p>
<p>No, because there is a world outside America&#8230; and no, I am not using a VPN to circumvent regional restrictions, if it doesn&#8217;t do it out of the box, it isn&#8217;t a feature.</p>
<p>plus even on america carriers there its no 4G signal everywhere, and stupid usage restriction make it worst&#8230;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t listen to these cretins.  I know which &#8220;8&#8221; you&#8217;re talking about.  And agreed, it would seem that number has stagnated over recent years.  Better optics are all well and good, but at some point it&#8217;d be nice to see that number going up too.</p>
<p>I will see at the event what will happen, then I will see.</p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p>They looks pretty similar.<br />
Page seems to list both 4.2 and 4.1.2<br />
Only OS difference from the pics is the centered clock.<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RZFE2.png" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also slightly thicker than the GNEX.</p>
<p>Also the LG Nexus 4 screenshot is showing notification changes that have only been available in custom ROMs.  So either they changed up the notification area or Google/CPW is just trolling  us.  I mean two weather apps in the notification area is the screenshot they choose to show off?  Just weird.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=29315992">It is from custom ROM</a></p>
<p>should you match the home button for scale?  If so, the lg is larger than it should be.</p>
<p>Screenshot is from custom rom for Gnex, it is not from google.</p>
<p>8GB?&#8230;you gotta be shitting me&#8230;well I guess I&#8217;ll stick to my GS3 until early next year when all the S4 Pro phones come out</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the announcement, this is a retailer jumping the gun and listing a model&#8230; Does it tell you this is the only model?</p>
<p>There is nothing conclusively It is looking increasing likely that storage is going to be an issue.  Even 16GB is not enough for most power users.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a power user and this is fine for me. If mean a power users full up their phone with games, music and videos then yea maybe not me.</p>
<p>I have a 32 Gb iPod touch, and here&#8217;s hoping to acquire a 64 Gb phone. ¬¬</p>
<p>8gb is too small but you will never ever see a nexus device with anything more then 16gb. Ever. Google wants you to use their cloud services, hoarding all of your music and videos on a single device isnt what they want you to do. I hope they have a 16gb version because 8gb is just to small.</p>
<p>Yea, except that they&#8217;ve already shipped 32GB Nexus 7s out to people and stores. 32&gt;16.  Take off your tin foil hat, it&#8217;s not very appealing.</p>
<p>Well where I live it&#8217;s 2G all the way here, takes me 5mins to stream 10secs of a song, so I ain&#8217;t going cloud unless all of the UK is on constant 3G at <strong>least</strong>.</p>
<p>and not even us have decent 3G or 4G&#8230;. so yeah good luck with the cloud push, 16 gb should be the minimal but 32gb should be the standard by now&#8230;.</p>
<p>I still cant understand how difficult or pricy its to ship with a micro sd slot&#8230;. its not that hard even my blackberry have one&#8230;.</p>
<p>The page has contradictory information on the OS version. Says both 4.2 and 4.1.2.<br />
What&#8217;s the display type?</p>
<p>From the leaks, the display is an IPS LCD.</p>
<p>LG is making it, So it should be LCD</p>
<p>Thanks guys! Just thought it might be amoled due to google (see previous 3 nexus phones). But yeah, wrong assumption.</p>
<p>Not My Next Device, for sure.</p>
<p>Selling a flagship smartphone with only 8GB internal storage in 2012 is a joke, and a bad joke too. No other company does this, just because it&#8217;s a Nexus doesn&#8217;t mean it gets to. It would just be pathetic if there isn&#8217;t a higher capacity version made available later on.</p>
<p>Yep, Google should of learned when they dropped the 8GB Nexus 7.</p>
<p>They should of, but they ofn&#8217;t of. ;)</p>
<p>Did you stop to think that this might be an entry level model as is the norm to get an attractive *from price and maybe, just maybe if people wait for the announcement on Monday there might be more models announced during the announcement, where they errrm announce things</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry for assuming people are smart enough to know that a &#8220;from $x.xx&#8221; usually means they&#8217;ll be paying more than that, like the $99 XBox that requires a subscription. And to me it makes no sense for Google to tell retailers about only one version of the device in advance and then wait to announce models with higher capacities. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re waiting for an LTE version as well, it&#8217;s just a case of adding more storage. But hopefully you&#8217;re right and I&#8217;m wrong and they announce versions with higher capacities.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking this may hit at $299 (maybe $350), but agree that 8GB is just sad.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t see myself doing that, especially since there are no unlimited data plans accessible to me. I think this month I&#8217;ll test T-Mobile coverage but am not expecting much&#8230;</p>
<p>32GB for $350 would do it for me. Maybe $399 but&#8230;not likely.</p>
<p>Please Google, start a Nexus program for multiple handsets&#8230;please?</p>
<p>Wow, talk about unreasonable expectations. $350 for a 32GB, top tier device with high end specs? You must be joking.</p>
<p>$350 is something in dream. The phone is top spec&#8217;ed.</p>
<p>If they make it LTE capable , a 32GB storage and a $500 price-tag, it would be an instant buy for me.</p>
<p>If people believe this will be the <strong>ONLY</strong> option i don&#8217;t know what to say to them.</p>
<p>It would just be pathetic if they don&#8217;t make bigger capacity devices IMMEDIATELY on launch!</p>
<p>8 GB of  storage. 8 GB OF STORAGE!?!?!? My freaking Captivate has more storage then that. That is a DEAL BREAKER. Google, LG, I don&#8217;t care if you have to delay launching the phone, if it comes out with 8 GB of storage, i&#8217;m not getting it. Period.</p>
<p>Where does it say this is the only model, this is just a retailer which always jumps the gun, jumping the gun with one model</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t even been announced yet, jeeesh, wait until the Monday announcement.</p>
<p>where does it say its not? Its what people see now so thats the reaction. Deail with it. If this is the only model then we are pissed if its not then great but its what we see now and thats our reaction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not Google&#8217;s fault Carphone warehouse listed the phone before it was announced, using dodgy screenshots from XDA</p>
<p>I am guess it will ship out 2 models: 8GB and 16GB. Then they will upgrade it to 16GB and 32GB sometime next year, just like Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Maybe then they would be selling it in different storage capacities like Phone.</p>
<p>Nexuses have never been flagship with specs, I&#8217;d say.<br />
What puzzles me is it&#8217;s still not a reason to downgrade to 8Gb. Personally, I&#8217;d be happy to have 8Gb and pay less, but oh.<br />
And yeah, centered clock looks doesn&#8217;t add value.</p>
<p>8GB, not 8Gb.</p>
<p>If it was 8Gb, you would just have enough space to fit the OS.</p>
<p>Yeah. right.</p>
<p>This is the full leaked image: <br />
<img src="http://cdn.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nexusae0_170.png" /><br />
It&#8217;s obviously fake. It&#8217;s got a third-party battery indicator (and third-party weather indicator) in the status bar, and the map is not rendered. Plus, the centred clock is clearly from AOKP, and the Nexus on the back is obviously shopped in. How can anyone take this seriously?</p>
<p>If the image is real, I will eat my hat, and I love my hat.</p>
<p>Clearly Google is trolling us.  :P</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&postcount=416" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&amp;postcount=416</a></p>
<p>This looks like crap. Another cheap plastic ripoff of the iphone 3g? Come on.</p>
<p>And the back looks like a club toilet&#8230;</p>
<p>And by the way google might be marketing Nexus line as cheap and efficient. Like, price/value great, you know. Working machines, not entertainment.<br />
Seems in line with Nexus 7.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 is an entertainment device&#8230;</p>
<p>Hence why it came with free entertainment.</p>
<p>it could be if they added MHL, but its not&#8230;</p>
<p>8gb completely ruins any chance of me getting this. That&#8217;s super annoying.</p>
<p>8 GB? &#8211; what a joke.</p>
<p>You know from an early leak they won&#8217;t release 16 or maybe more?</p>
<p>Tell me how, please.</p>
<p>There have been enough leaks and rumors that put this device at 8 or 16GB that I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s safe to assume that&#8217;s what it will have. Hopefully Google will surprise us Monday, I&#8217;ll be really disappointed if they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>There were also plenty of leaks saying the last Moto Razr was going to be edge-to-edge with no bezel.</p>
<p>Trusting rumors is pretty dumb.</p>
<p>What, were you planning on installing more than 2 games?</p>
<p>I was wanting to pickup the next Nexus phone. But not with 8GB.</p>
<p>8GB is so wrong! I have Galaxy S3 with overall 48GB memory, that is hardly enough for me as I pack tons of music and data with me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s even more frustrating that they are cutting down internal storage when they haven&#8217;t even got Google Music out of the US yet.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a sign that Google Music is about to be launched internationally.</p>
<p>Bingo.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter. Google music caches the hell out of your storage. Where&#8217;s that going to fit? Assuming you don&#8217;t have any pictures anywhere, since even cloud pics cache tons of storage.</p>
<p>8GB, likely 5 after the OS, will be nothing but tiny apps and cloud cache.</p>
<p>Where have they cut down on the storage?</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t even announced it yet, how do you know they won&#8217;t announce 16GB or maybe more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know why you equate a retailer leaking one particular model as being an official Google announcement</p>
<p>I wish you were right and the leaks are wrong. But going by the recent history of leaks, the odds are stacked heavily against you.</p>
<p>The camera is only 8MP, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, last thing it needs is more noise by being too high a MP for the rest of the camera tech</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still gonna say there is going to be a 16gb version. I just think Carphone warehouse haven&#8217;t got all the specs yet, these are not press shots and they state different versions of Android running on the device. If this 8gb then we&#8217;ll shortly have more RAM than ROM in our phones!</p>
<p>Um what?</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ulbma.png" /></p>
<p>Panorama?</p>
<p>Is that what they&#8217;re calling panorama now? Or is that something else?</p>
<p>Maybe that is the panorama that was rumoured (with which all of us were like &#8216;Seriously?! Android already has panorama!&#8217;).</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t have vertical panorama, nor can you take a picture of everything (literally) around you.</p>
<p>Apple have patented the word &#8216;panorama&#8217;</p>
<p>It does have vertical panorama already. Last holiday I shot tons of vertical panoramas with the stock camera app on my Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Yes. Copying it from Apple. /s</p>
<p>Street view!</p>
<p>Carphone Warehouse seems to be the absolute worst at keeping secrets.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; about $580 Australian Dollars.</p>
<p>It should be much less than that because the price here includes the VAT.</p>
<p>By my calculations, without the VAT (which is the price everyone outside of the UK will pay) it will be $311.2 pounds, which amounts to $483 Australian Dollars, which is vastly cheaper than what I paid for my Galaxy Nexus at launch ($650 ish if I remember correctly).</p>
<p>(20% off £389 = £324.2)</p>
<p>Yeah but we pay gst so you have to add another 10% on as well</p>
<p>389.95 pounds = $640.31 Australian by Current rates.<br />
okay, so 20% off for VAT, 10% on for GST&#8230; so %10 off overall.</p>
<p><strong>$576.28</strong><br />
But it&#8217;s Australia, so&#8230;<br />
a) The Official price will be higher &#8216;cos retail likes to make us suffer.<br />
b) There&#8217;s be plenty of online Hong Kong sourced shops competing&#8230; Kogan, Mobicity, etc.  That&#8217;ll bring the price down.</p>
<p>8GB on the Nexus 4 is what 1024&#215;768 is on the iPad mini; fail.</p>
<p>Storage is equally as important as display resolution? I&#8217;d go lower storage for a denser screen anyway, IMO.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna say the polar opposite of that statement.</p>
<p>Did anyone notice the clock placement in the center of the status bar? Is that a 4.2 thing? I&#8217;m smelling a lawsuit from Apple</p>
<p>I actually prefer the clock on the right, so i hope you have the option to move it back.</p>
<p>Agreed. just looks odd to me</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&postcount=416" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&amp;postcount=416</a></p>
<p>With  a new capacitive/resistive hybrid screen I&#8217;ll call a &#8216;Digitus Display&#8217;</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LD8OL.png" /></p>
<p>That is very interesting indeed.</p>
<p>what was that&#8230;the blackberry somenthing</p>
<p><a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/wireless/detail-page/bberry-storm-veriz-hero_duo.jpg"></a></p>
<p>thunder? sensitive to pressure?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistive_touchscreen" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistive_touchscreen</a></p>
<p>Seriously 8GB? That is subpar on so many levels. Not going to upgrade from my GNex to this crap regardless of how much better the s4 and camera is.</p>
<p>At 8GB, it&#8217;s more of a downgrade from your GNex.</p>
<p>Surely there will be higher spaced models.</p>
<p>No GLONASS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Are you kidding me? It has fookin hardware support for GLONASS, since it&#8217;s got a Snapdragon!!!!</p>
<p>So&#8230; Junk hardware but the latest software?</p>
<p>S4 Pro isn&#8217;t junk.</p>
<p>Junk Hardware??&#8230;.have you seen the Optimus G?&#8230;yeah deff not junk hardware.</p>
<p>When I read the leak about 4.2 having panorama capturing on the camera I was confused because it was introduced with ICS. Now it makes sense!</p>
<p>From the Carphone Warehouse page &#8211; &quot; 360° panorama photos&quot;.</p>
<p>Someone with an iPhone showed me 360 panorama views on their phone that they made with an app, and they were awesome! I couldn&#8217;t find the app on Android though. Not a groundbreaking feature but I&#8217;m really looking forward to it!</p>
<p>Photosynth, possibly?</p>
<p>Nexus devices already have panorama and have for quite a while.  Apparently this is going to include vertical and horizontal panorama.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m well aware of that seeing as I own a Galaxy Nexus. I don&#8217;t think you understand what a 360 degree panorama is.</p>
<p>On the specifications it says &#8220;Android OS, v4.1.2 (Jelly Bean)&#8221; not 4,2</p>
<p>Says 4.2 on Top-Features.</p>
<p>says 4.1, 4.1.2 <strong>and</strong> 4.2 take your pick.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t have a clue, so why not put them all in there, let the customer decide&#8230;</p>
<p>I was really hoping for a 32gb model, but I doubt that&#8217;s happening if they&#8217;re offering a 8gb version.  It&#8217;s probably going to be 8gb and 16gb.  I&#8217;ll probably just end up getting the 16gb version, but I&#8217;ll be super pissed if they pull a nexus 7, and have a 32gb version available a few months from now.</p>
<p>Somebody will be losing their job.<br />
That is definitely CPW&#8217;s inventory system and I seem to remember the boxes at the bottom left have login details</p>
<p>They might not be so concerned if they have the phone for sale to the public on their own website, it&#8217;s not much of a leak is it?</p>
<p>Offered in 8GB???!?!</p>
<p>If that pricing is correct, that would mean over $600 US for an 8gb Nexus 4?  I was so excited for the 29th, now, not so much&#8230;</p>
<p>You forgot to remove their 20% VAT.</p>
<p>And that US prices are almost always the same as the British prices with a pounds to dollars direct swap.</p>
<p>I expect this to be 399 in the US.</p>
<p>8GB for $399 sounds about right to me</p>
<p>$399/449 is my guess for 8GB/16GB</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re right, but look at the Nexus 7 pricing&#8230;<br />
8GB model: £159. Take away 20% VAT and you get £132.50. Convert to USD: $213.89<br />
That&#8217;s a 7% markup over the US price of $199<br />
Apply that to Nexus 4: £389 &#8211; 20% VAT &#8211; 7% markup = $488.93<br />
So I&#8217;d guess between $450 and $500 for US pricing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the image is fake.</p>
<p>The image is from EVLeaks, who has been super reputable. It might be fake&#8230; but it&#8217;s not likely.</p>
<p>Yeah the image definitely looks fake&#8230; but who knows at this stage.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&postcount=416" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&amp;postcount=416</a></p>
<p>The image maybe fake, but it definitely showing on a major website maybe 4.2 is customization and they took cues from AOKP.</p>
<p>This is the greatest thing to happen to Nexus, since Nexus.</p>
<p>im not crazy about the screen size (4.7&quot; is more than i need), but other than that, if the build quality is good enough and it comes with at least 16 GB version, im sold.<br />
just need  to find a back cover to hide that horrorific LG logo</p>
<p>dont let the screen size fool you, youve got onscreen nav buttons too, the screen size will more likely be 4.3+onscreen buttons</p>
<p>Wow &#8230;seriously? So the onscreen buttons are .4 inches? Are you out of your mind? lol That means the Galaxy Nexus had a 4.2&quot; screen? Dude it&#8217;s more like 4.65 inches, I think it&#8217;s .05&quot; not .4&quot; because that&#8217;s ridiculous lol.</p>
<p>Do you realize how big 0.05 inches actually is?  Good luck touching an area that small.</p>
<p>Looks like a Galaxy Nexus from the front side. Nice phone though.</p>
<p>The spec sheet clearly isn&#8217;t finished or has been published with some fields in their default state. We won&#8217;t know true specs for a few days.</p>
<p>&#8230;.Gud thing always come from Google :D</p>
<p>This device disappoints. LG? 8GB storage? Thicker &amp; heavier than the Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>This new Nexus feels like a step in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>yeah because more solid construction materials, higher ram, faster processor, faster GPU, and an actual RGB screen layout, along with bigger battery size is really going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>get used to it.  Google and other manufacturers have started realizing that build quality like apple&#8217;s is important you are going to see android fans used to cheap plastic phones complaining about it.  It&#8217;s actually pretty funny.</p>
<p>&#8220;this thing is well built and doesn&#8217;t have plastic wtf&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how the white Nexus 4 looks like?</p>
<p>8 GB? <br />
<img src="http://memeorama.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/oh-no-you-didnt-pingu-meme.gif" /><br />
Come on Google&#8230;</p>
<p>Not quite getting the pricing.<br />
Nexus 7 &#8211; Quad-core, 7&quot; 1280&#215;768, 8GB, wifi, bluetooth, GPS etc. = £159</p>
<p>Take away 7&quot; screen, large battery<br />
Add 4&quot; screen, small battery, cellular gubbins<br />
Make whole thing smaller</p>
<p>Charge £390 &#8211; 2.5x as much?</p>
<p>I know making things smaller sometimes costs more, but then so do big things. Too much of a gap.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered that. Even if you look at the iPad for example, where is this extra $130 coming for a cellular radio? I just assumed it had a lot to do with parts and patents but when comparing phones to tablets I&#8217;m starting to think they just artificially increase the price knowing carriers will pay, subsidize and no one would be the wiser.</p>
<p>Smaller size is a feature.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s because Google and LG have to pay more licensing fees for the phone because of it&#8217;s radio and the S4 soc is probably worth more than the Tegra 3 T30. I&#8217;m just guessing though.</p>
<p>Still the touch screen buttons. I hate those.</p>
<p>Also, how does this move things on significantly from the Galaxy Nexus? Specs are too similar</p>
<p>IPS LCD instead of AMOLED is a potential improvement in color accuracy, brightness, and sharpness.</p>
<p>Otherwise I agree, too similar.</p>
<p>Are you guys joking?</p>
<p>Besides the far better screen, you have the S4 Pro Quad Core processor that absolutely demolishes everything else on the market. You have an additional GB of RAM. You have a higher quality camera. You have better build materials. You have a 20% bigger battery. This is an absolute monster of a device, yet you think its too similar to the Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>What else do you want? I can understand more storage or maybe new design, but the SPECS themselves are as high-end as you can get these days.</p>
<p>The camera sounds like the only one of those I would notice in regular usage.</p>
<p>My Galaxy Nexus never lags and works plenty fast.  Maybe my expectations are low after years of single-core Android 2.X phones  (G1 and Galaxy S).  My battery makes it through a full day no problem.</p>
<p>The RAM might make a difference when I do something nutty like hook my Nexus up to my monitor, keyboard, and mouse and try to use it like a desktop computer, but in regular usage it&#8217;s fine as is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just not a compelling upgrade to me, and the sheer physical size of the screen is a big turnoff.  I made that mistake with the Nexus and I don&#8217;t intend to get another phone this size again.</p>
<p>My Nexus lags doing a variety of things. Nothing terrible, but the S4 Pro will definitely help performance AND battery life overall.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t argue with that, but it&#8217;s not enough to make me lay down $400 or whatever this thing retails for.</p>
<p>If this thing is around $400, it&#8217;s a bargain, especially when other high end phones go for $550-650.</p>
<p>Folks are guessing $400-500 just a few comments above.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s really $550, then there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d buy one.  I bought my Galaxy Nexus for $400 and that was painful.</p>
<p>$300!  That&#8217;s pretty amazing for a phone this quality.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m still not sure about the 4.7&quot; screen size or the glass back, the quad-core chip, 720P SLCD, 2 GB RAM, better camera, and bigger battery somehow seem like a more compelling upgrade in light of that price and some Verge hands-on time.</p>
<p>So&#8230;  you&#8217;re right.  :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of getting the Lumia 920 and a Nexus 7 for my custom ROM addiction. Because I love Android so much.</p>
<p>Haha remember when people were defending the 8gb memory? Like &#8220;oh its a testing unit, it&#8217;ll come with 16gb&#8221;. Well where are they now?</p>
<p>Also I really doubt this is the S4 pro version. I think it&#8217;s just the normal s4, not pro.</p>
<p>Says quad-core on the specs list.</p>
<p>How does this prove either way that 16 will not ALSO be available?</p>
<p>Oh, here&#8217;s one now!</p>
<p>i think the first one is fake:<br />
<a href="http://richimage.carphonewarehouse.com/image/media/LG-NEXUS-4_BLACK_1_L.png" target="_blank">http://richimage.carphonewarehouse.com/image/media/LG-NEXUS-4_BLACK_1_L.png</a><br />

<p>How did you find the other pictures on their servers?</p>
<p>Probably&#8230; If you look at the 4th one, it shows the normal notification area&#8230;</p>
<p>Damn&#8230;I was hoping for that 13MP camera.</p>
<p>The 13MP camera is crap. The images are so noisy. The 8MP camera has better image quality because the rest of the camera is not capable of supporting anything higher than an 8MP sensor.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems is that the camera area is too thin. One of the factors that make the Lumia 920s camera so good is it&#8217;s a fairly thick phone. That allows them extra space to put in things like OIS.</p>
<p>I will take a white 16 or 32gb please</p>
<p>Looks kind of dumb&#8230;  <br />
Why cant they team up with Sony and make a nice cool phone made instead of going for this spec war thing?</p>
<p>Interesting that they would include a keyboard similar to Swype. I think that&#8217;s one of the main reasons I prefer Android. The newest Swype beta is a bit of a mess so I welcome the alternatives.</p>
<p>I wonder what camera sensor they are using. Does anyone know?</p>
<p>Probably Sonys with 1.1 micron pixels ( if it&#8217;s the same as Optimus G).<br />
It&#8217;s a mediocre sensor in low light and produces quite a lot of noise.</p>
<p>It would be quite a shame if that&#8217;s the case :/</p>
<p>8GB with no SD card slot is utter insanity. Even if they try to fob us off with 100GB of Drive space that&#8217;s does not suffice. Look like I&#8217;ll be keeping my Gnex for another year..</p>
<p>screw this I&#8217;m buying the one x</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping for a One X Pro</p>
<p>One X+ Pro Quad</p>
<p>Come On 29th!!!!</p>
<p>8 gigs of storage? This is not my next.</p>
<p>I really hope they offer at least a 32gb version as well.  8gb is not even close to enough unless it offers MicroSD as well.</p>
<p>I have 16gb internal now on my GS3 and that fills up real quick with games like NOVA 3, a very small music library and pictures and videos I record. 8gb is a deal breaker.</p>
<p>not 8 gigs, can&#8217;t be, nooooo</p>
<p>8GB is not enough Google&#8230; I really hope you&#8217;ve got a 16gb version too&#8230;.</p>
<p>ATM on my Galaxy Nexus I have 13.33GB usable, of which music is 5.65GB, apps are 2.26GB, pictures are 1.12GB and that means I only have a few gigabytes left&#8230; going with 8GB means I&#8217;d have to junk all the music and even then I&#8217;d struggle for space.  Not good enough on a so-called flagship phone.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve made it clear that they want to push their cloud music solution, rather than local storage. It has it&#8217;s good and bad points; specifically not having 3rd party apps that can access Play Music.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind putting my music on play, but with games easily passing the 1gig mark something needs to be done.</p>
<p>Specifically bad if you ever need to listen to music in places where you don&#8217;t have a data connection (planes/subway). I also like to have some movies/tv shows on hand to pass the time too, and not everything is available to stream on Netflix&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, I take a lot of pictures and video with my phone, so 8GB isn&#8217;t going to cut it&#8230;<br />
I just preordered a 16 GB Note 2, and snagged the $43 deal a few days ago for a 64 GB class 10 microSD card. It&#8217;s freaky how much storage I&#8217;ll have.</p>
<p>I want a Nexus device, but at this point I&#8217;m going to get my Note 2 subsidized on contract, and by summertime I&#8217;ll consider buying the LG Nexus when the price certainly drops (A buddy bought the GNEX for $600 at launch, and by summertime Google sold it for $350).</p>
<p>Yeah I bought the GNex on release for £530 but if this is only 8GB I&#8217;m gonna have to think pretty hard on it first.  If it&#8217;s not this, it&#8217;s the HTC One X+ I think.</p>
<p>With data caps and games over 1gb each, 8gb of local storage is just flat out useless for a lot of people.  My mom wouldn&#8217;t know the difference, but I bet a lot of people here require a lot more than 8gb of local storage.</p>
<p>Not only that, but non stop streaming of cloud data is also a huge battery killer. <br />
Not having a choice to pay for more local storage is just bad all around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not excited about this at all. I was really hoping for an HTC 1x type nexus. This one looks very similar to the galaxy nexus and I&#8217;m not a big fan of LG.</p>
<p>So unsexy.</p>
<p>Who is going to buy that phone with only 8 GB storage? I&#8217;ve got about 100 small apps and a few big games in my Galaxy Nexus and it&#8217;s already over 8GB. It&#8217;s unrealistic specs and I must wait for the 16 GB version&#8230;</p>
<p>Agreed! Also, why so fat?</p>
<p>8gb of on board storage. I&#8217;ll keep my GS3.</p>
<p>Really hope they have something bigger onboard. 8 gigs definitely won&#8217;t do. And I also hope (though unlikely) that a U.S. Carrier picks this up. The off-contract price for this thing will be godly expensive.</p>
<p>I hope either HTC or Sony is working on Nexus as well.</p>
<p>No tegra&#8230;.</p>
<p>S4 pro is better than Tegra.</p>
<p>Not for games.</p>
<p>People still play high stress games on phones (like MW3)? I just mess around with angry bird, granny smith, or something like that.</p>
<p>Tegra Optimized Games.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually the next big <em>thing</em></p>
<p>The Adreno 320 GPU is lot more powerful than Tegra 3s</p>
<p>too bad that iphone user have it already, shoutouts to square enix, epic games and capcom among others&#8230; investing in games for the platform</p>
<p>really?</p>
<p>this is interesting too&#8230; also from carphone warehouse system supposedly<a href="http://androidandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/32gb-nexus-7-650x404.png" target="_blank">http://androidandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/32gb-nexus-7-650&#215;404.png</a>&quot;/&gt;supposedly</p>
<p>sorry that came out wrong</p>
<p><img src="http://androidandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/32gb-nexus-7-650x404.png" /></p>
<p>That phone looks super-wide.  I&#8217;m already unhappy with how wide and tall my Galaxy Nexus is, and it&#8217;s 1280&#215;720.  The extra 48 pixels won&#8217;t help.</p>
<p>I was really hoping for an actual Nexus 4, not a Nexus 5.</p>
<p>How do y&#8217;all feel about the Sony Xperia S?  4.3&quot; 720p screen, dual-core Snapdragon, ICS update already release and JB custom ROMs available.</p>
<p>No T-Mobile 1700 AWS band.  :(</p>
<p>Or at least, only on the Docomo NTT Xperia Acro HD, which is $700+ to import.  Ugh.</p>
<p>And there are zero other 4.3&quot; 720p phones with the AWS bands.</p>
<p>The Huawei Ascend D1 has a 4.5&quot; screen with AWS bands, and is cheaper, but I was really hoping to get down to the 4.3&quot; size.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get back to reality the 8gb nexus 7 storage was low but it still sold. Google is obviously doing this because of the fact that it gets the nexus into more peoples hands. I&#8217;m sure there will be a 16gb model for others</p>
<p>Thanks to Verizon screwing over Nexus owners last year, I doubt we get another LTE VZW Nexus.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about the number model it is.. Though nexus is a better number than some product code. I have gotten to the end of my contract. This looks like an interesting option.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zGsE5.png?1" /></p>
<p>Oh deary dear. This isn&#8217;t going well.</p>

<p>Car phone warehouses  site has gone down for maintenance probably to take down the nexus 4</p>
<p>Hahaha just noticed&#8230; lol</p>
<p>Pass. I&#8217;ll wait for the Nexus 5 with 4GB of storage. 8GB is unusable but at least with 4 people won&#8217;t be able to even pretend that it&#8217;s enough.</p>
<p>Nexus 4 &#215; 2 = 8gb<br />
Nexus 5 &#215; 2 = 10gb</p>
<p>duh</p>
<p>storage = 2 ^ (7 &#8211; nexus)</p>
<p>duh</p>
<p>Umm&#8230;what?</p>
<p>^ means &#8220;to the power of&#8221;</p>
<p>Nexus 4: 2 ^ (7 &#8211; 4) = 8 GB<br />
Nexus 5: 2 ^ (7 &#8211; 5) = 4 GB</p>
<p>As BigBryC above said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really contemplating getting this phone but how good are LG phones??? I really have no idea. Ive never had one. I have only had an iPhone &amp; Samsung Galaxy&#8230;.Does the fact that its LG scare anyone?</p>
<p>In the specs it says android 4.1<br />
I have a feeling this thing is a troll</p>
<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9haJUTVrt4mU_-1-RUIXYCp2-PZQunESmvX_Tt_PkC-tgnJ0Uq_ZtHShNtYpDXn_YLwDdhVRsr4" /></p>
<p>If you think there&#8217;s something strange about the screen, you&#8217;re right:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&postcount=416" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=29316521&amp;postcount=416</a></p>
<p>Note the date.</p>
<p>I think Google have us all fooled. Best way to prevent leaks of the real device is to put out a fake one. I mean, a prototype device just knocking around. Loads of photos and the photos show what to be AOKP ROM. It&#8217;s a big troll by Google.</p>
<p>I want to believe you. But leaks have been pretty accurate lately.</p>
<p>Random icons in the status bar, center clock.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure that&#8217;s so official.  Nice journalism, as usual.</p>
<p>Percent overlay on battery&#8230;and are those two [non-stock] weather app notifications?</p>
<p>Nope,  not stock either. The 2 icons look like a battery % indicator.</p>

<p>ah good call, I didn&#8217;t look close enough. I&#8217;m still a little confused</p>
<p>Anyone else disappointed that it has an LCD screen instead of an LED one.</p>
<p>Oh god. Seriously???</p>
<p>Dude.. </p>
<p>Will someone think of  the storage!!<code>#!</code></p>
<p>For all of you nutjobs freaking out, the official event is 4 days away.  Just wait and see before you soil yourselves.</p>
<p>I hear that they are going to actually put a decent OS on the thing.</p>
<p><img src="http://pbs.twimg.com/media/A5tydorCQAAFIk1.jpg" /></p>
<p>As a Gnex owner this LG nexus phone seems like refresh of my current phone</p>
<p>Seeing as it has the same specs as the Optimus G but with stock Android, I don&#8217;t think so buddy.</p>
<p><img title="Hosted by imgur.com" src="http://i.imgur.com/KUbXd.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>face palm</strong></p>
<p>Yes, a Nexus phone released one year after a previous Nexus phone is a refresh of said phone.</p>
<p>4.2 is not called Key Lime Pie hey? looks like Google is too scared to do it ;)</p>
<p>Source link is now inactive, I think Google may have been  in touch!</p>
<p>Nobody has confirmed that it will only be offered in 8GB, Can you guys relax?</p>
<p>Oh GOD! I have to buy an LG phone.</p>
<p>Looks like it will probably be $400 at launch.  I think I&#8217;ll buy one to replace my AT&amp;T iPhone 4 and move to T-Mobile on their $30/month plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/nexusae0_170.png?w=614cc876" /><br />
1. Open photoshop<br />
2. Crop<br />
3. Desaturate<br />
4. Adjust levels</p>
<p>Try harder next time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not buying this. Why is the battery on the right with the percentage on the left and the time in the center?</p>
<p>Minor changes to notification bar in 4.2?</p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s clearly AOKP. I just set up the same thing on my unofficial razr build. I really doubt 4.2 would adopt such a customizable notification bar as AOKP is using.u</p>
<p>Selling my iPhone 5 to CEX for £510 and picking this up the day it comes out, Profit!</p>
<p>The clock is centered</p>
<p>8GB storage &#8211; No SD card slot. No thanks. I&#8217;ll stick with my Gnexus.</p>
<p>Looks like they pulled the page.</p>
<p>I backed it up anyway.</p>

<p>8 GB?  Really?</p>
<p>Who in there right mind in today&#8217;s tech world would purchase a device with only 8GB of storage. You will be lucky to have 6.5 GB that is actually usable. I know, I know, some of you are going to say the CLOUD!!! Apps are way bigger these days, add in music, photos, 1080p videos, etc&#8230;&#8230; and you are out of space in no time. I wasn&#8217;t onboard at first with the move to non-removable batteries but the newest processors built on 32 and 28nm silicon and getting lower every year are incredibly efficient and putting that problem to sleep. But I can not for the life of me figure out why manufacturers are doing away with SD Cards and giving us less and less storage. Shouldn&#8217;t it be the other way around? If the phone ships without an SD Card, at least provide the consumer with 32 or 64GB of onboard storage.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only using about 5GB of space on my Nexus. Don&#8217;t really care about putting that much stuff on my device. I can live with 8gb; however, I&#8217;d much rather prefer to have 16gb so I have extra breathing room.</p>
<p>You are a monk, it doesn&#8217;t count. For me on the other hand, that amount is nowhere near  enough.</p>
<p>There are others who are like me who don&#8217;t need the extra space. Some people need more. But clearly, you need to stuff your devices with countless hours of videos and music as you come across as an individual who has no other choice but to entertain yourself as others are unwilling to be around you.</p>
<p>If there isn&#8217;t a 32gig version then you can count me out (unless it has microsd, which I doubt).</p>
<p>This and the 32GB nexus 7 are some of the worst kept secrets in tech.  Seems its really hard to keep anything a secret these days.</p>
<p>I need at least 32GB and for it to be UK LTE compatible, otherwise there&#8217;s really no point. Otherwise Im gonna opt for a S3 LTE for £450 + £20 to unlock it.</p>
<p>Hope more comes out before the launch next week.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I like the time being in the middle of the notification bar&#8230;</p>
<p>Gestures are so overrated.</p>
<p>and patented too..<br />
<a href="http://goo.gl/kqScl" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/kqScl</a></p>
<p>Looks like the RAZR Maxx HD for me.</p>
<p>8GB!? Really Google! 8GB!?<br />
WTF were you thinking Google! My iPod Nano 3rd generation came with 16GB memory.</p>
<p>so let me understand this, they created a beast phone, with such of high specs but they are shipping it with 8gb? and non expandable with microsd, what the hell its wrong with LG and Google&#8230;.</p>
<p>are they serious&#8230; i really hope they sell the galaxy nexus at cheaper price like 200?</p>
<p>Ok, so Google admits to being taken aback by the popularity of the 16GB Nexus 7, consequently rumored to add 32GB Nexus 7. THEN comes out with 8GB phone?</p>
<p>Unless this is supposed to be some ridiculously cheap unlocked phone, why buy this?</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;ll probably be a ridiculously cheap high-end unlocked smartphone.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/250x250/28994892.jpg" /></p>
<p>Only disappointment so far, I hope they&#8217;re is expandable storage &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>How is nobody losing their shit in the comments right now? 8GB of storage with no micro SD? Who the hell thought that was a good idea!? This no longer stands a chance at being my next!</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>Android Owners arent losing their shit because they know they don&#8217;t need local storage at all. Sure its a little disappointing on a spec perspective, but everything is stored in the cloud for android. Nothing is local other than apps, which dont take up that much room.</p>
<p>really cause my gnex has almost 9 gig of apps and photos 8 gig of local storage is not enough for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll wait until the actual reviews come out so I know the battery will actually last me a decent part of the day before I have to re-charge it. Otherwise I might go from my Nexus S to an old GNex just for the sake of a removable battery.</p>
<p>F that! 8GB is a fail!</p>
<p>Buying Galaxy Nexus&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Kinda boring design don&#8217;t ya think?</p>

<p>Anyone think there&#8217;s hope for a VZW Nexus 4?</p>
<p>nope</p>
<p>Keeping costs low is great and all, but at least offer larger storage options [ie. 32gb, 64gb] for people who are willing to pay more for it.  I&#8217;m sure there are a ton of people who&#8217;d pick up a 32gb version if it exists.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, Carphonewarehouse just got lots of free advertising with virtually every tech website covering this story.  It might have just been a mistake that they made this page accesible to the public (and the information &#8220;leaked&#8221; is legit or they might know nothing more than everyone else and purposely released this page for the publicity. They probably aren&#8217;t that smart though.</p>
<p>Why does the FFC have to be so painfully off center? Is anyone else annoyed by this? It looks worse than on my Galaxy Nexus</p>
<p>Wow can people understand the fact it is the 4th Nexus Phone? Not device.</p>
<p>Is 8 GB seriously the only configuration?  That&#8217;s so disappointing&#8230;  I&#8217;d be much happier with, say 32 GB.  I don&#8217;t want to always be streaming music.</p>
<p>LG fails itself with that unexpandable 8 GB memory.  Even Apple puts minimum 16 GB in its flagship.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t we (collectively) have this argument all the time, is the Nexus a flagship phone or a development release? Surely any flagship phone would be advertised to high heaven, but Google and manufacturers don&#8217;t seem to do that, it&#8217;s announced then very little fanfare otherwise. Galaxy S III on the other hand&#8230;</p>
<p>your point misses his</p>
<p>It is very likely that this is one of the devices that will b announced Monday. That said, we know nothing beyond the physical factor. It will run android. I would b amazed if it&#8217;s not offered in 16gb. 8gb isn&#8217;t a deal breaker for Me though honestly. The most sizable digital data I use is music, and I have Google Music for that. 8gb would feel slim in a year or two, but not alarming imo. I&#8217;m sure they will have a &#8216;wow&#8217; feature, Android doesn&#8217;t have any major ones yet and Google has plenty of areas to pull tricks from. <br />
If this comes to Verizon for &lt;250 I&#8217;ll be in. Never owned a Nexus and my current is getting long in the tooth.</p>
<p>could google have partnered with anyone worse?!</p>
<p>Well when does 4.2 get released?</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone will ever see this post. Nice video review though, I can&#8217;t wait for the Jelly Bean source code to drop so that the awesome devs for my Fassy over at XDA and Rootzwiki can tear into it and make a port. :D</p>
<p>I see you, TheFirstUniverseKing. I see you.</p>
<p>Lost me at 1024 &#215; 600</p>
<p>Got me at HDMI out. (If Nexus 7 only had HDMI out)</p>
<p>Gah!  HDMI out is the reason I didn&#8217;t get a Nexus 7, but I&#8217;m really disappointed in this screen!</p>
<p>Lost me at that bezel. As have most tablets. Anyone else willing to sacrifice some &#8220;grabbability&#8221; in favor of a more efficient use of space?</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m pretty good with it.</p>
<p><strong>shrugs</strong> guess I&#8217;m just SOL here.</p>
<p>Just looked at the photos of the HTC J Butterfly. <br />
It&#8217;s 5&quot;, but doesn&#8217;t look as big as the other gargantu-phones cuz of the smaller bezel.</p>
<p>Kinda hoping someone does the same w/ these 7in tabs</p>
<p>The Nexus effect :)</p>
<p>Nothing good about that. Google effectively killing off OEM&#8217;s. At least Microsoft throws them a bone and does not sell at cost price or below it.</p>
<p>Given the specs, namely the screen resolution, this thing is overpriced.</p>
<p>Overpriced by what metric? Most cheaper devices, e.g. Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, aren&#8217;t sold for s profit.</p>
<p>According to your logic, every device ever is overpriced. Google and Amazon can sell devices for (or sometimes under) costprice because they earn their loss back trough the ecosystem. OEM&#8217;s cant do that.</p>
<p>Asus is presumably making a small profit on the Nexus 7, it&#8217;s just that Google isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Google was stimulating their Android tablet ecosystem, ’cause without it OEMs cant sell many tablets anyhow. OEMs still have lots of room to add functionality users want (expanding memory! OTG support! MHL! etc)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want it if it means every tablet being as ugly as this one!</p>
<p>2mp front facing camera?  I would have skimped on that part to keep costs down.</p>
<p>The MicroSD slot is the only thing this has over the Nexus 7.  Not sure why anyone would buy this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that I wouldn&#8217;t suggest that anyone bought this instead of the Nexus 7, but the important thing about this tablet is that it&#8217;s well-specced (for the most part) and much more affordable than the typical $400+ Android tablets and, being sold at a profit. That is the key.<br />
Kudos, Acer.</p>
<blockquote>being sold at a profit</blockquote>
<blockquote>Acer</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure about that. Acer is notorious for selling products at cost or loss to gain marketshare and scale, that have it in their blood: the last CEO was booted out of the company for it, yet the next one started doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Through scale comes reduction in costs &amp; their avenue for profit. Not wise, but if you&#8217;re gonna scrap about at this end of the market than that&#8217;s about the only option open to you.</p>
<p>No one can charge £400 for a 7&quot; tablet. Even £400 is down to companies not getting with the times. A £500 10&quot; tablet should be a beast compared to the current flagship generation. A £500 laptop should be designed to last the consumer two to three years at a minimum. When these companies were selling PC and laptops at around that price, they were expected to last half a decade.</p>
<p>HDMI is also a big plus though on the A110</p>
<p>The HDMI port and the micro SD card slot are good, but not enough to make this thing a better option than the nexus.</p>
<p>Oh I disagree completely.  Lack of those things make the Nexus a no go for me.</p>
<p>Google like killed any chance of any OEM making any money with Android tablets, that is unless they decide to spend a night with them for a Nexus device and even then it&#8217;s petty money.</p>
<p>Wow. Total fail on the screen resolution and price. Ya know if it at least matched the Nexus 7 on specs and was a bit more expensive, that would be understandable.</p>
<p>I loved my Acer Iconia 10.1 inch&#8230;great hardware, but this product doesn&#8217;t over a very compelling choice. Especially if the new iPad is $299 or below.</p>
<p>I will never buy another Acer product after the A100.</p>
<p>That looks like a tough sell, Google and Amazon kinda screwed everyone by making their tablets so cheap, and still quite good.</p>
<p>Makes me think what OEM will want to invest in Android tablets, specially with Windows 8/RT coming along as another viable option.</p>
<p>I guess MS pricing on the Surface we a reflection of that, they couldn&#8217;t go very cheap and do the whole &#8220;get one to everyone&#8221; thing, since that would really piss OEMs off.</p>
<p>Soooo&#8230; What is the advantage of this over a Nexus 7?</p>
<p>SD card slot?</p>
<p>HDMI-Out &amp; SD slot at the expense of reduced resolution and unknown future software updates.</p>
<p>Why in some of these shots does it look like it&#8217;s running stock jellybean and in others it looks like it&#8217;s running a modified version of the 10&quot; Android tablet UI?</p>
<p>perhaps it is switchable?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested to see how Android tablets do in a market where Windows 8 and 8 RT makes their push. I considered myself a candidate for an android tablet not too long ago but never pulled the trigger. Instead now, I see myself getting a surface RT and don&#8217;t see how I could fit an Android tablet into my household.</p>
<p>The problem with Android phones and tablets is that you don&#8217;t know if they will receive the latest OS updates and if so, how long you will have to wait for it?<br />
There have been phone makers who promise updates to expensive phones and then say they changed their minds.<br />
I would stay away from Android as a consumer and app developer. The OS is becoming fragmented.</p>
<p>becoming? LOL</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is a problem for the average consumer. They simply don&#8217;t care. Ever looked at someone&#8217;s PC with Windows Update? Yeah, they&#8217;re never updated. I work in technology, so of course it annoys me, but I also have the know-how to update it and keep it running the latest version of stock Android without the need of carriers and manufacturers.</p>
<p>Ohhhhh look!  Acer made another overpriced tablet&#8230;</p>
<p>Good to see the Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire&#8217;s effect on the market. It&#8217;s not just their influence on these other manufacturers, but also on Apple, who has decided to make a cheaper 7&quot; tablet. Apparently Microsoft didn&#8217;t get the memo, but that&#8217;s ok, the market will soon make it very clear to them.</p>
<p>Man, this thing has all the bezel you could ever want.</p>
<p>If this had the Surface&#8217;s resolution (1364&#215;768), ran Windows RT and was sold for a similar price I&#8217;d be all over it. The one thing I love about my Kindle Fire, and the reason I use it more than my Transformer or iPad is the 7&quot; footprint.</p>
<p>Doh, 1366.. edit function please :)</p>
<p>The best tablet besides the N7 was the Toshiba Excite 7.7. To bad Toshiba lack of rooting community killed it.</p>
<p>720p is the lowest acceptable resolution for tablet now. I declare Acer lose every potential customer on the verge.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Undercutting Microsoft&#8217;s Surface in pricing? However this would not stop me from purchasing a windows 8 tablet. Sounds like fun having both.</strong></strong></p>
<p>&lt;<em></em></p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the Acer ring and 0 updates. Nexus 7 for me.</p>
<p>Yo Acer and everyone else, I&#8217;m really happy for you, I&#8217;ma Let you finish, but the Samsung Series 7 Slate is one of the best tablets of all time!</p>
<p>I dont plan on buying any andriod devices unless they are dirt cheap. Too many companies are dropping support  as soon as they move on to the next device.</p>
<p>At least with windows I know they will patch it for 5 years or more and that my device will be &#8220;safe&#8221; to use for a long enough time.</p>
<p>I mean really how much support or love is google giving Honeycomb users?  Are they?</p>
<p> &#8220;with windows I know they will patch it for 5 years or more and that my device will be "safe" to use for a long enough time.&#8221;<br />
Tell that to the winphone7 or winphone7.5 user&#8230;. safe but left behind?</p>
<p>Down to £130 in the UK with a rebate &#8211; now how does it stack up against the Nexus7?</p>
<p>Can you guys stop using this half-baked, underdeveloped flash player and just use youtube?</p>
<p>Yes! Please</p>
<p>Seriously&#8230; I always have problems playing the videos on this site. Can&#8217;t see this interview at all!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had an issue playing any video on this site at all and I&#8217;m on an iPad all the time.</p>
<p>Where does Matias get all of his shirts? They&#8217;re pretty nifty.</p>
<p>Is this one of these times when the words mean the opposite of what they meant to begin with?</p>
<p>Bad=good<br />
Sick=good<br />
nifty=I think I&#8217;m going to throw up in my mouth, oh gosh Matias, we don&#8217;t need to see your chest hair.</p>
<p>No, I was actually being literal with my phrasing. To each his own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to watch this video but it doesn&#8217;t show up. Youtube, please. Whatever you&#8217;re using isn&#8217;t working.</p>
<p>Finally got a chance to watch this&#8230; video finally showed up. lol<br />
Aside from the phantom videos, The Verge is just making everyone else look like amateurs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t normally care about this but&#8230; Really with the shirt and glasses.  Is he lobbying for the third member in a new night at the Roxbury movie?  It&#8217;s distracting.</p>
<p>While the video and contents were nifty, I want to know where to find that massive photo behind Matias, honestly. Even a smaller size, or just WTF it is would be enough for me.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a photo of the Nexus Q dismanteled with all its inner pieces showing.</p>
<p>The verge is the best site around i visit it twice a day but this this is how most of the videos are on the verge. Im on a 25/20 mbit connection.</p>

<p>Recommend this comment, if you viewed the whole interview in 100% zoom on the web-page.</p>
<p>Your galleries are always very slow to navigate through. I often have to go to another site for pictures</p>
<p>I completely agree. They should also add navigation to next photo when clicked on the current photo.</p>
<p>I always noticed it, thought it was a problem that only happened to me D:</p>
<p>Meanwhile HTC is bitching about WP not supporting 1080p screens.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be a flagship phone, but an affordable phone. The HTC WP one was probably meant as a flagship phone, and it would look silly among all the 1080p Android competition.</p>
<p>I hope this is the direction flagship phones are heading. Been waiting for flagships to all reach the 5&quot;+ mark.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s truly a sad day in tech when we&#8217;re all &#8220;forced&#8221; to sue 5&quot; monsters for phones in the future. But I know it&#8217;s inevitable.</p>
<p>*use ;-)</p>
<p>Consumers vote with their wallets. If more people preferred smaller sized flagships then companies would put more R&amp;D towards those. As it turns out it looks like the bigger phones sell better, so this might be the trend for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>When was the last time any company except Apple launched a TRULY flagship phone smaller than 4.5&quot;?</p>
<p>Let me guess &#8211; 2 years ago?</p>
<p>How am i supposed to &#8220;vote with my wallet&#8221; when i can&#8217;t actually get a flagship phone smaller than a towering monstrosity?</p>
<p>HTC 8X is 4.3&quot;.  Its size and screen density have been praised by many reviewers.  But I don&#8217;t think it will sell well enough (due to being WP8 and competing with the Lumia 920 at the same price point) for that to matter.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t really any better&#8230; I still think my old DROID Razr was big. I liked the screen of my OG Droid and Droid 2, TBH, but there need to be small, good phones like the iPhone 5 out there. Mostly only people who are super into tech get into the screens, for the rest it&#8217;s split into iPhone and GSIII. They could at least try to split the market into half, small and big and give consumers more choice. The Nokia Lumia 800 size v. the GSIII Size.</p>
<p>The Blackberry London will be 4.2 inches.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind monster phones being flagship phones, I just wish that smaller 4-4.3 inches phones get more powerful internals and good support.</p>
<p>Take off the part of the screen for the buttons on the Nexus 4 and you got a phone with a smaller screen that is powerful and has &#8220;good&#8221; support.</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s cheaper to put all those internals into one 5inch device instead of making 2 devices AND one of those devices is smaller AND more expensive to engineer</p>
<p>It boggles my mind that consumers want to ride this bigger phone train and use larger screen size as a freaking spec&#8230;</p>
<p>When using a smartphone as a general computing device, the larger the screen is, the better. Whether it&#8217;s function as a phone is compromised is a another story.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not a smartphone it&#8217;s a smartdevice.  I have one of those too, called a tablet.</p>
<p>Does it fit well into your iPad pocket?</p>
<p><img src="http://media.techeblog.com/images/ipad_jeans.jpg" /></p>
<p>PS: iPhone is actually a horrible phone. It&#8217;s an excellent smart device that happens to make the occasional calls.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s sad at all. The Note II is the best smartphone I have ever owned. Bring on the larger devices!</p>
<p>The problem for HTC is they lost the mind share.<br />
Is Samsung galaxy sIII(306 ppi) and note II (267 ppi) are looking silly because of droid DNA?</p>
<p>Ha, I hope Samsung can keep up production unlike LG and Apple</p>
<p>LG received shockingly high interest in their product that they couldn&#8217;t expect. They are selling all they can make, they are not remotely used to these sort of sales.</p>
<p>Apple get <em>insanely </em>huge numbers of purchases and sell all they can make.</p>
<p>But what are &#8220;these sort of sales&#8221; re: the Nexus 4?  We don&#8217;t know, because Google won&#8217;t tell us.</p>
<p>Fair point. Supply could be very low making demand look higher than it is.</p>
<p>Yeah.  I&#8217;ve just learned over the years not to get too generalize-y with my purchasing decisions.  As much potential as the Nexus 4 has to upset the carrier-dominated US market, Google seems pathetically uninterested in pursuing that destiny.  It may have sold well on  word-of-mouth alone, but somehow I doubt it, since not a single non-techie I know has heard of it for any reason other than I told them about it.  Which is pretty sad considering how many commercials I&#8217;ve seen pushing the new Chromebook.</p>
<p>This better be one of those phones you get for free when starting a new 2 year&#8230;</p>
<p>Would be even better if this is the phone for pre-paid carriers.</p>
<p>Yep, lots of sneering at the free &#8211; $200 pre paid phones round here, but they&#8217;re what now drives marketshare. Our interpretation of &#8216;good enough&#8217; is much higher that the average Joe.</p>
<p>Outside of the US, the market the savings are huge if you opt for one of these mid &#8211; low range phones. People think it&#8217;s just a pre-paid / PAYG thing, it&#8217;s not. The competitive nature of the non-US mobile operators mean that opting for a &#8216;cheap&#8217; handset means much lower contract price, as they subsidy the carrier is paying is that much less.</p>
<p>Good enough phone (for free) + cheap monthly payments. Total cost of ownership (24 months) = $700<br />
or<br />
High end phone (for $200) + huge monthly payments Total cost of ownership (24 months)  = over $2000</p>
<p>Not hard to see why phones like this and other less publicised Samsung handsets are taking over the whole market.</p>
<p>Why would you want a 480p phone for 2 years? 1080p is becoming the norm in 2013</p>
<p>Not everyone needs the latest thing. A phone isn&#8217;t a status symbol to everyone, for many (the majority) it&#8217;s just a tool. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Because almost none of the people on this planet live in the particular bubble you live in.</p>
<p>Interesting release. Not sure why people would buy this when you can just buy an S III. If you want a 5 inch phone, then get the note.</p>
<p>I reckon it will be cheaper is why&#8230;let&#8217;s see, also the dual sim is interesting.</p>
<p>Wonder how much cheaper. If I was a potential customer I&#8217;d just spend an extra 100 or whatever and get the galaxy sIII</p>
<p>It will be 200, but not when you get into contracts.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t expect this to be sold much in US. And other oligopolized markets.</p>
<p>Lower price.</p>
<p>did anyone think of this being targeted to the elderly? the 5 inch low res screen has bigger words, require a whole less processing, bigger real estate to fit those words in and it&#8217;s cheaper. not to mention video calling is a lot more comfortable with better camera quality o.o pretty sure grandma wouldn&#8217;t need an overpowered S3 to do simple tasks</p>
<p>what an insane company Samsung is!</p>
<p>Yet&#8230;.much of the buying public have a real attraction to &#8220;the biggest screen&#8221;, because thats obviously the main feature of the phone, screen size, yup!</p>
<p>This thing might not get much attention compared to the Galaxy S III and Note II etc, but this thing will slaughter sales of Non Samsung devices I bet.</p>
<p>We really are in an Apple vs Samsung world folks.</p>
<p>Sadly I expect a lot of people to buy this over a GS3 saying &#8216;s better because it&#8217;s bigger, and over the note saying it&#8217;s better because it&#8217;s cheaper.</p>
<p>it might be noticeably cheaper, we do not know, PRESUMABLY it must be cheaper!!! :-)</p>
<p>Lets say the outright price of a Galaxy S III is 600 USD, the Note II is 700-800 and this thing will fit in around 500 USD.  Made up prices, but surely something like that, in terms of gap between the cost of each device.</p>
<p>Otherwise it wouldnt make sense.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a high spec screen, it&#8217;s just large, which should mean pretty cheap. I think this could hit the $300 spot. Nice.</p>
<p>The target is probably lower than 300.</p>
<p>I highly doubt it. The Galaxy S3 Mini which is a piece of crap goes for $400+</p>
<p>This is silly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s to compete with KIRFs of the GS3.</p>
<p>&gt;5 inch screen.<br />
&gt;400x800 screen res.<br />
&gt;WHUT???</p>
<p>Yeah i don&#8217;t know what they were thinking&#8230; 1080p is becoming the norm and 720p becoming 2nd best&#8230; 480p is so 2010</p>
<p>WVGA on a 5 inch screen? Had better be real cheap.</p>
<p>Not exactly sure who would want a phone like that&#8230; but people still buy Nokia phones with windows phone 7</p>
<p>Samsung is killing it right now.</p>
<p>Pretty smart putting out a midrange that looks like the S3 / Note 2. They&#8217;re slowly building a brand identity. Starting to chip away Apple, especially at price points Apple won&#8217;t compete at.</p>
<p>This</p>
<p>The competition isn&#8217;t Apple. It&#8217;s KIRF. Apple is only competition on the ultra high end market.</p>
<p>But they do (or will) compete with Apple&#8217;s ecosystem and services. The higher the Galaxy&#8217;s in circulation, the stronger the case for buying into Samsung&#8217;s world &#8211; accessories, development, etc.</p>
<p>800&#215;400 on a 5 inch screen?</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/32080663.jpg" /></p>
<p>He is so upset that the world &#8220;SIMPLY&#8221; is right over his face.</p>
<p>Havo dad, Legolas!</p>
<p>memegenerator put it that way :P</p>
<p>One does not simply write over Boromir&#8217;s face!</p>
<p>Here you go<img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/32082840.jpg" /></p>
<p>Do the dual SIM support 3G? Most dual SIM phones are low end phones. It&#8217;s good to see Samsung making a dual-core one, albeit oversized.</p>
<blockquote>Do the dual SIM support 3G? </blockquote>
<p>Yes, although usually only one will work for data. Depends how Samsung has done the implementation in the software.</p>
<p>Something tells me if Apple released a phone with these specs there would be an uproar on these forums&#8230;</p>
<p>You will get people saying its innovative.</p>
<p>No you wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You would get Apple people saying its innovative.</p>
<p>No, you wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>People thought the iPad Mini and iPhone 5 were innovative.</p>
<p>No, but you would get people saying Apple are going for marktetshare, competing at a lower price than before.</p>
<p>Moot. Apple would never release a phone with these specs.</p>
<p>Moot? So you&#8217;re saying there&#8217;s still potential for that to happen.</p>
<p>This is one strange phone.  2MP front camera is pretty high end, but 5 inch WVGA? Why?! Is this supposed to be a low end note, without the note features?  Perhaps made just for the elderly? Is Samsung just throwing everything at a wall, and seeing what sticks?</p>
<p>This is for emerging smartphone markets like Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, for example, 5-inch dual-SIM Android smartphones with WVGA resolution are making a killing in sales right now.</p>
<p>Sounds like a good phone for Grandma!</p>
<p>Haha that&#8217;s actually true</p>
<p>If they mix this with the premium suite then they got themselves a winner in the budget range.</p>
<p>This is made to compete with low cost ripoffs of Samsung models in emerging markets.</p>
<p>Like this one, which retails for around 179 dollars without contract.</p>

<p>i kinda like this one better, seems more polished</p>
<p>Until you use it.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>I love that this WVGA KIRF lists &#8216;life like clarity&#8217; as a spec, and the way that PPI is listed twice (once without a number next to it, as a dispay type :) )</p>
<p>At least they aren&#8217;t lying I guess . That phone does indeed have a &#8217; pixels per inch display&#8217;.</p>
<p>Kinda cool but price is going to be what makes or breaks this phone in my opinion. The dual sim things could be a great feature for some people.</p>
<p>Curious device. Strange mix of high end styling and mid range parts. Feels sort of like this years ZTE Skate&#8230;</p>
<p>The dual sim angle is interesting. Implies they are pitching it at emerging markets &#8211; maybe it will be a high end phone in these markets markets, where the G3/Note 2 are unaffordable?</p>
<p>Pricing is obviously the key for the grandma crowd! Wonder how it sits via a via the galaxy 2. Effectively it&#8217;s a G2 with a bigger screen&#8230; But G2 seems to be hanging around as Samsungs mid-range (and prolly pretty profitable) mid range offering a remarkably long time. Do they undercut this and risk losing that margin? Or price it similar and risk making it a dead duck?</p>
<p>Since when did a phone with specs like these become a mid range phone?</p>
<p>Technology advances at a scary-fast rate.</p>
<p>Q4 2010</p>
<p>800&#215;480 screen. Thats why.</p>
<p>This company does not deserve success. I wish they were sued out of the mobile industry.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with making a different phone for every possible market? This is a good way to make money, as is apparent by their sales numbers.</p>
<p>See: Nokia.</p>
<p>Look I&#8217;m not an Apple fanboy or a Samsung fanboy but this was too tempting</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/32082921.jpg" /></p>
<p>More like Apple increased the screen size on the iPhone 5 so now Samsung is doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Ehh. I wish these manufacturers would just make last year&#8217;s high-end model the current mid-range model. I have no allegiance to Apple but there are a lot things they do right. Samsung and HTC  pump out dozens of SKUs every year, which I think is just confusing consumers.</p>
<p>800 &#215; 480 on a 5-inch screen. Kill me.</p>
<p>The gakaxy s3 is aleeady 0$ on contract, what&#8217;s the point?</p>
<p>No offence but how can so many on this site (and similar sites) be so blind to the market for non-contract phones? Also markets where the telco&#8217;s actually complete, thus low price handset on contract = substantially lower costs per month.</p>
<p>Good enough phone (for free) + cheap monthly payments. Total cost of ownership (24 months) =  less than $700<br />
or<br />
High end phone (for $200) + huge monthly payments. Total cost of ownership (24 months) = more than $2000</p>
<p>Think about how much bigger the addressable market around the world is for the first option versus the latter. That&#8217;s why these handsets exist and are important to OEMs and platforms. That&#8217;s where the real marketshare growth is, plus some (albeit slim) profits too.</p>
<blockquote>five-inch, 800 &#215; 480 WVGA display</blockquote>
<p>&#8230;seriously?  Ugh!</p>
<p>186 ppi makes it probably mdpi, which gives it an effective, usable screen space of 800 &#215; 480 dips.  Compared to the usable screen space of the Note II which is 853 &#215; 480 dips or the GS3 which is  640x360 dips.  So same usable screen space for app layout as the Note and more than the GS 3, but chunkier text and lower-res graphics.</p>
<p>The new notifications is one of my favorite features of jelly bean.</p>
<p>i wish more apps would utilize this</p>
<p>Right now the current apps i have that utilize it are Rdio, Google Music, Foursquare, and i think Astrid.  Not 100% sure.</p>
<p>A couple others are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.teamtasks.tasks.paid&hl=en" target="new">Tasks</a> and Tune In Radio.</p>
<p>the Tasks implementation is a bit lacking though</p>
<p>I agree with both of these statements.  Awesome feature, just needs more developer support.</p>
<p>Also, Google Music needs to let me thumbs-up songs from the notification.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it&#8217;s one of those things that you think, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they do this sooner?&#8221; But definitely, I believe it&#8217;s one of those &#8220;game-changer&#8221; features. Android continues to give its users more and more agility. Actionable and expandable notifications is one of those things that, to me, mark an OS that feels contemporary.</p>
<p>Hopefully it won&#8217;t be hidden below OEM skins when JB starts to roll out :/.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I like it when companies support Jelly Bean, but I still haven&#8217;t found really any reason for me to use Evernote.</p>
<p>I used it once, didn&#8217;t find it useful, and left it. Several months later I gave it another try and all of a sudden I find it invaluable.</p>
<p>Tax reference number? It&#8217;s there.<br />
National Insurance Number It&#8217;s there.<br />
Car Insurance Policy number? It&#8217;s there.<br />
Flight itinerary details? &#8230; you get the picture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a one stop place that is easy to search for all those small details I used to email to myself, synced across all devices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m confused. What about existing customers?</p>
<p>Not gonna get 4.1</p>
<p>They still are. Samsung was just not sure of the RAM requirement for 4.1. But Nexus S will be upgraded, so why not the first batch of GSIII?</p>
<p>Part of me thinks it&#8217;s futureproofing to make sure that the GSIII gets the same versions of Android as whatever the next Nexus smartphone gets, especially 1-2 years from now.</p>
<p>You would hope so. It&#8217;s clear only Nexus devices will ever see the most updates. I think this is even more true with the GNex and any Nexus device moving forward.</p>
<p>2GB of ram in a phone? Oh Java&#8230;</p>
<p>Samsung is terrible about updates so while they say that, it seems unlikely that they would actually care.</p>
<p>Let me check&#8230;. <br />
SGS went through 3 major updates already &#8211; 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.<br />
SGS2 &#8211; 1 major update &#8211; 4.0<br />
Nope, doesn&#8217;t sound that bad.</p>
<p>Umm, those updates came incredibly late.</p>
<p>only is the USA, talk to your carrier.</p>
<p>Samsung is actually pretty good at updating. I think you&#8217;re confusing the issues that the US carriers have had. Hopefully with the SGS3 being the same across all of them, that won&#8217;t be as big an issue this time.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s samsung, who knows&#8230; there&#8217;s no logic in it.</p>
<p>What about existing customers? . .  .</p>
<p>Some of them may not get 4.1.</p>
<p>Why not look at what they put into the Galaxy Nexus? Wouldn&#8217;t that give them a clue as to what specs JB could run on?</p>
<p>They built the last two Nexus phones!</p>
<p>But the Galaxy Nexus doesn&#8217;t have TWiz on top of Android. Samsung needs to make room for that. That&#8217;s like an entire OS on top of Android OS itself. The original Galaxy S got stuck to 2.3, while the Nexus S is already on ICS and will be getting 4.1.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not true. TWiz is essentially a new launcher and a few reskinned apps. It is not an OS on top of an OS, it is a mutant OS. And there is no way that the system requirements would jump from the 1 GB ram in the Gnex to 2 GB. What the hell are they running in the background.</p>
<p>I know TWiz ain&#8217;t an OS, I meant it in terms of the memory it requires to operate smoothly. While the latest version is now better and lighter, it seems Samsung&#8217;s aware that their TWiz&#8217;d phones might require more RAM than phones with the vanilla version of Android.</p>
<p>I upgraded my Nexus S to ICS and it was so slow that it was what drove me to get the GSIII. &#8216;Getting&#8217; the OS is way different from it being usable. Google can do this on developer phones like the Nexus series because as devs, I would posit that we have slightly different tolerances to the mass market consumer to speed/responsiveness vs. having the latest stuff for testing.</p>
<p>Buy a new phone when 4.1 really picks up next year&#8230;  or return yours if you still can.</p>
<p>Since the nexus S is getting 4.1 and it only has 512mb of RAM, I think its safe to assume that existing customers will be just fine, unless touchwiz is a massive memory hog, which it could still be.</p>
<p>&#8216;Wiz isn&#8217;t particularly inefficient, no.</p>
<p>384mb of ram, on my NS4G</p>
<p>there&#8217;s no room on the original SGS for ICS + Touchwiz, even though it has 512 mb of RAM, same as nexus s, hence no official upgrade path*, and that&#8217;s probably what they are worried about&#8230;</p>
<p>*other ROMs are available like CM9.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not RAM that&#8217;s an issues. Its the ROM. With CM9 (Team Hacksung build) on my Fascinate (Galaxy S), there is only 13MB of free space. That&#8217;s CM9. ICS + Touchwiz can&#8217;t fit on the 300MB of ROM. ICS isn&#8217;t a memory hog, runs smooth on 384MB of RAM. I can&#8217;t wait for my 2GB GS3 :D</p>
<p>Most likely, existing customers already got their major update from Gingerbread to ICS. That being said, at the rate that most OEMs get their software update to device (with carrier intrusion), it&#8217;ll be time for you to upgrade to a new device, especially at the break-neck speeds Android OEMs are pumping out the hottest and greatest devices. With that said, what they mentioned at Google I/O is that the PDK has already been made and will subsequently be made months in advance of new releases. OEMs can work on new versions before Google announces it. So, Samsung already got the PDK for JB and should be working on it now for device updates. If it&#8217;ll accommodate current hardware is yet to be seen, considering how Samsung dropped the GS1. But who knows? Like I said, you already likely got your 1 major update.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lumia users&#8230;</p>
<p>(I KID I KID)</p>
<p>ಠ_ಠ</p>
<p>So that they can make an even more sluggish programmed version of TouchWiz.</p>
<p>guess you havent been reading the reviews for the GSIII</p>
<p>TouchWiz is probably (actually) the lightest skin on Android at the moment. I would say it&#8217;s between it and Blur on Motorola devices. Both skins are remarkably light for ICS. You&#8217;re thinking about Sense UI.</p>
<p>I thought Sony&#8217;s new timescape is even lighter, less than any of the launcher replacemrnts?</p>
<p>for the major players&#8230;you are correct. Sony is the fastest and lightest skin</p>
<p>It was even the case for 2.3.</p>
<p>TouchWiz on the GS3 is extremely thin and light. Outside of how the icons are skinned, its very close to stock.</p>
<p>Good to know&#8230;. But I&#8217;ll just wait patiently for my Nexus to update&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>While I am pariently waiting for AOKP to be updated ;)</p>
<p>I just installed AOKP on my G2 today. Tired of waiting on CM9. Im very happy so far.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using AOKP for months now, and I firmly believe it&#8217;s better than CM9. Won&#8217;t be going back to it. It has a lot more features to boot as well. If you look at a lot of the ICS ROMs, a lot of the features came from the AOKP guys.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really good that there is more than one AOSP project; CM9 and AOKP both provide great alternatives to manufacturer skins.</p>
<p>I wonder how long it will be until some chinese manufacturer just uses CM9.</p>
<p>Good for Samsung owners.  Though I guess that they&#8217;ll be getting the JB update when Android 5.0 is available?</p>
<p>not  necessarily.  Thats what the PDK is for.  Im surprised no one is talking about it more.</p>
<p>Funny joke, but maybe you weren&#8217;t listening to the conference. Google has ALREADY released the PDK to some of its partners. They should already be working on the JB update for their devices. Now, the question is how hard are they working on it, how much carrier intrusion will delay the process and of course, whether the OEM feels fit to see you get another update after you&#8217;ve already received your one update (see Galaxy S I).</p>
<p>The original Galaxy S actually came with Eclair, so we got two official updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running a pretty lag-free version of CM9 on mine at the moment too.</p>
<p>Even better. Two updates. So I don&#8217;t know what people are complaining about.</p>
<p>Remember when Samsung made the 2nd and 3rd Nexus, and how late their phones received GB and ICS?</p>
<p>Remember when the Galaxy S got Gingerbread before the Nexus One in Europe because there were no US carriers to muck it up?</p>
<p>Samsungs ROM with Touchwiz is too big for the SGS1, it wont fit on the phone, hence no update.</p>
<p>I guess we can assume Samsung is one of the partners that got the PDK.</p>
<p>If only Motorola had information like this before releasing the Droid 3, perhaps we wouldn&#8217;t be stuck with a phone that can&#8217;t handle full Ice Cream Sandwich because of RAM limitations. <br />
Sorta sucks being stuck for 2 years on what winds up being a stopgap model release. Good to know SIII owners won&#8217;t feel that.</p>
<p>The Droid 3 has just as much RAM as the Nexus S, which is getting an update.<br />
There&#8217;s no RAM limitation, Motorola just can&#8217;t be bothered.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already been superceded by the Droid 4. Too many phones released in such a small period of time.</p>
<p>I agree, I feel the Droid 3 was a waste. The Droid 4 should have been what the third was. If that meant waiting longer, so be it.</p>
<p>Exactly, there was no reason to replace a phone so shortly after release. Motorola really needed to slow down there.<br />
The fact that it didn&#8217;t make sense for a D4 to come out so soon after made me not even consider the fact that my D3 would become obsolete so quickly. I was assuming an annual schedule like what Motorola had been following (more or less) with the Droid line up to that point. Boy was I naive.<br />
At this point, I am entirely indebted to the modding community for doing what Motorola should be doing.</p>
<p>Apparently, it&#8217;s actually Texas Instruments that can&#8217;t be bothered. Granted, Motorola abandoned it as well, but that&#8217;s only half of it. The kernel Texas Instruments released for the processor in the Droid 3, (OMAP4), assumes that the phone has at least 1 GB of RAM. In order to make ICS work fully on the Droid 3, the entire kernel would need rewriting to support less RAM. <br />
The only device running ICS on a TI OMAP4 processor and 512 MB of RAM is the Archos Gen9 80, which has heavy modding in the memory management to make it work.</p>
<p>I hope that this 3 extra months, which Google gave, are enough for Samsung and other manufacturers to prepare an update.</p>
<p>So&#8230; what happens if you&#8217;re in a country that doesn&#8217;t get a variant?</p>
<p>How about a big FU for Samsung?</p>
<p>Now we Europeans get the short end of the stick because we got the damn phone about a month earlier? Sometimes I really hate that biz. I was thinking about getting a SGS3 but not I&#8217;m waiting for some kind of SGS3+ Every other SGS2 has 2 GB RAM  and even if it&#8217;s not neccessary and we got the Exynos 4 Quad,  we got played again, doesn&#8217;t matter what reviews say.</p>
<p>price of being an early adopter</p>
<p>I have the International SGS3, and I&#8217;d rather have my Exynos Quad than the S4 dual core.</p>
<p>Plus, I have been able to enjoy the best smartphone in the World for some time now. That&#8217;s also worth the price.</p>
<p>I you think you got screwed, take a look at how US consumers get screwed on a daily basis by their network providers. No thanks.</p>
<p>Users of the international version didn&#8217;t get played, the international version is faster and more powerful than the variants is most aspects, what you need to say is that in your case not having the biggest gun around (2gb) equals being screwed which is also funny considering you don&#8217;t own an S3.</p>
<p>And besides using your language there&#8217;s never been some kind of international samsung galaxy S+ or S2 + &#8230;.</p>
<p>You trolls need to find more creative and slightly intelligent ways of coming at samsung but then again you are trolls &#8230;..</p>
<p>most of what you say is correct except about the plus stuff:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9001_galaxy_s_plus-3908.php" target="_blank">http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i9001_galaxy_s_plus-3908.php</a></p>
<p>Sprint isn&#8217;t rolling out ICS officially to Galaxy SII owners until July 12.</p>
<p>The carriers are the ones that need to get their act together, even with Google spoon-feeding them I have no faith in them.</p>
<p>I think that it&#8217;s the S4 variants that get the extra RAM (XDA).</p>
<p>How the hell is this even believable.</p>
<p>Are you SERIOUSLY trying to suggest that Samsung couldn&#8217;t ask Google what the spec requirements would be?</p>
<p>The 2GB is more likely a way to appease consumers who wanted Exynos instead of S4, not because their engineers weren&#8217;t sure. That&#8217;s a load of crap.</p>
<p>lol if you think hardware partners are going to release updates in a timely fashion because of the PDK thing. customers are still going to have to wait months for their update or not receive it at all.</p>
<p>carriers</p>
<p>If u think lumia users (wp marketshare is nothing really compared to android) got screwed then atleast they got mentioned with a 7.8 update, google doesnt even care about anything now except their nexus phones which I belive are less than the 7% running ics. Thanks alot! (throws his defy out of the window)</p>
<p>The Nexus devices are the only ones they have control over. They are doing all they can (PDK).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather have the S4 with the 2gb RAM. Here in the UK we got the 1GB Exynos combo.</p>
<p>Since the differences between 4.0 to 4.1 aren&#8217;t earth shattering new features (just important under the hood stuff), I&#8217;d suspect the S3 (intl version first) could get a JB by mid-september.</p>
<p>guess this is their excuse for the S2 not getting Jellybean then</p>
<p>Good, my phone is still stuck at 2.3.6. Could someone fix that?</p>
<p>for future reference:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/#" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/nexus/#</a>/</p>
<p>XDA can fix it.</p>
<p>I think, judging by the benchmarks of the international variant compared to the US ones, that they upped the RAM to offset the massive performance gap in some cases between the Exynos and Snapdragon.</p>
<p>So this means it&#8217;s probably up to a third party to bring Jelly Bean to the GS2&#8230;</p>
<p>Sounds like made up BS to me. It is obvious they put 2gb in the Qualcomm variants because um, that is what they are making and trying to sell? If all your mobile customers are ordering 2gb and you want that to be the standard in 2013, your latest products will have 2gb of ram. Haha</p>
<p>Samsung engineers thought that Jellybean might need 2GB of ram???? Seriously, I still remember when everyone was threatening to riot on the streets when Microsoft announced that Vista would need a minimum of 1GB&#8230;</p>
<p>Why did they have to make it sound like one of those fancy Japanese toilets&#8230;.the Touch Whizz :-)</p>
<p>mmmmm, warm air drying&#8230;&#8230;.ahhhhhh</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Is this source from Google or a 3rd-party firm?</p>
<p>Google.</p>
<p>Google. Interesting that at the current adoption rate, it will take more than 3 years before 80% plus devices will be 4.0 or higher, something iOS achieved in a few months (for 5.x) even without OTA. They had to literally connect to iTunes to get the latest OS. So adoption should be even faster for iOS 6 now that OTA is built into 5.x</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that little is happening in the way of updates, but the positive I take from this is that adoption of NEW Android 4.x devices is high.</p>
<p>In that people continue to buy new phones, which now start to come with 4.0?</p>
<p>In that some try to discount Android by saying its sales are driven by bargain devices, and these stats indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>Or the fact that the share of 2.2 + 2.3 is still so humongous shows that sales are driven by bargain devices.</p>
<p>As long as there are no exact sales figures for every Android handset out there it&#8217;s impossible to prove that theory&#8230;</p>
<p>The Razr and Razr max still have 2.&#215;. Those were top of the line phones just a couple months ago.</p>
<p>There are a lot of non-premium priced devices with 4.0?<br />
There is a t least 64mil premium Android devices.(16% of 400m) With a crapload of premium devices that will not get ICS.</p>
<p>Well HTC and Samsung just updated a slew of their phones to 4.0.</p>
<p>ios updates quicker than Android. News at 11.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t like all Android phones even update ota. Some of them need to be connected to a pc to update.</p>
<p>Interesting that you fail to make light of the <strong>fact</strong> that the only way to get updates directly from Google is if you buy a Nexus device, and that unfortunately for Google, Nexus devices aren&#8217;t the most popular Android handsets being sold.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s so convenient when you miss out important, relevant details, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>That fact is important, but it isn&#8217;t relevant. It doesn&#8217;t change the argument one single bit.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s relevant &#8211; considering that Android-based handsets manufactured by the likes of Samsung, HTC, LG, Motorola, etc with non-stock and non-Google maintained updates are generally stuck on whatever version of Android those manufacturers have based their &#8216;distro&#8217; on.</p>
<p>Everyone knows about this issue in the Android space. I am just highlighting the huge difference this is causing in OS adoption rates in light of the new data.</p>
<p>Fine. But your post is classic offtopic trolling. Because you just stated praise for iOS without iOS being mentioned in the article or by the first poster.</p>
<p>And congratulations, you started a whole thread of offtopic replies&#8230;</p>
<p>Considering people are always connecting to iTunes anyway, makes sense.</p>
<p>Yeah but after installing iOS 5 last year, I may have physically connected to iTunes on my computer may be 5 times. The WiFi syncing takes care of it on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>Current adoption rate will increase though, once other devices come out with 4.1. Currently it&#8217;s just the Nexus 7 and Xoom tablets, and neither seems to be in stock.</p>
<p>Because you assume the adoption rate is linear?  That&#8217;s a pretty poor assumption since all their previous adoption rates were exponential.</p>
<p>They are also counting all custom Rom&#8217;s in this number so all those phones running CM10 count towards the 0.8%</p>
<p>Also speaking of i am the 0.1% with a Galaxy Nexus that just got updated to 4.0.2 thanks to taking it in for repair</p>
<p>Unlock that shit and flash the latest 4.1.1 build! (assuming it&#8217;s Maguro GSM)</p>
<p>Not bad a jump. SGS3, One X and GN must have contributed a lot recently. I believe it was 6-7% the last time these figures were shown?</p>
<p>The post says it was 10.9%.</p>
<p>Right. I remember in June it was 7% so i was just remembering that vague detail</p>
<p>10.9% &#8212; so around a 5% gain. Not too bad for one month. If we go by how many Android devices have been activated (last count was 400M at Google I/O &#8212; it has certainly increased since then) then around 64 million people have Android 4.0  (67.2 million have 4.0+).</p>
<p>Woah. Thats big..surely more than half have to be updates. How many ICS phones are there today? GN, SGS3, One X/S/V &#8230;Note?&#8230;And maybe 1-2 tabs</p>
<p>The smaller chinese makers (ZTE and Huawei and others) also have ICS phones on the market &#8211; somehow they manage to be a lot faster with updates (probably because they don&#8217;t insist to put a skin on every little detail of an already excellent UI).</p>
<p>More like probably because their quality assurance is terrible.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t really comment on Huawei&#8217;s QA in general but from my anecdotal experience I can say that my current Huawei Honor (U8860) is superior in all regards to my previous mobile phone, a Samsung Galaxy S (the U8860 is basically an upgraded Galaxy S with some extra goodies thrown in.) I bought it in March 2012.</p>
<p>The hardware is built very well and the custom software is very good, certainly better than TouchWhiz. The factory provided Gingerbread was very zippy but I replaced it immediatly with the stock ICS built Huawei provided for all their (English or Chinese speaking) customers. Just a few weeks ago Huawei rolled out the localized version of ICS for my region. It is stock, too, but now you can also install Huawei&#8217;s custom applications if you wish (and if you want to use the built in FM receiver/sender, you need to).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s probably a lot one can say about Huawei mobile phones but not that they are shoddily built, their software sucks and customer support is terrible. Actually I can&#8217;t comment on the last part, I didn&#8217;t need any customer support. Huawei provided a dead easy instruction how to update your phone to ICS on their website.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t the GS2 get it? That would have to contribute.<br />
Several older HTCs have got it &#8211; the Sensation has on some carriers.</p>
<p>Yes the GS2 did get ICS; however, the update has to be applied manually, not OTA. Not sure if the average user would go through the trouble of manually updating, let alone even knowing that an update is available.</p>
<p>Most of the Xperia line have ICS now</p>
<p>Something people need to realize before they start getting angry, a lot of phones sold running Android were the dirt cheap, POS phones, the ones that carriers and manufacturers forget immediately. Sadly this means the numbers will always show Gingerbread has a good amount of marketshare. Also, 2.3 is generally the cut off for older phones, and some people just generally don&#8217;t update, not enough to make it important, but still.</p>
<p>I think another thing to note is that iOS and Android have different philosophies when it comes to updating older, less-capable hardware. If you have a 2-year old iPhone and a new version of iOS is released, you may not be able to run all of the features, but you still get an update and it still counts as the latest version. For Android devices, if your phone is considered less than capable of running the lastest software, you won&#8217;t get it at all. It&#8217;s more all or nothing. So a good proportion of all iOS devices aren&#8217;t actually running the latest software because they don&#8217;t have all the latest features. Fortunately for iOS users, you still get as much of the new software as is reasonable instead of just nothing at all.</p>
<p>And main advantage is access to all all the new APIs, so it&#8217;s really convenient for developers.</p>
<p>The other difference is that most of the core apps (mail, maps, etc) are not part of the OS so they can be upgraded independently of the os core update.</p>
<p>Bullshit. Ipad1 owner here. Bought in mid 2010. No updates (ios6) for me. Not even a single feature. Less than 2 years old. <br />
I&#8217;m tired of people thinking apple updates its hardware for years.</p>
<p>The iPad 1 is the exception to the rule and of course it did get 2 major software updates (iOS4, iOS5) over its life span which is pretty good. The lack of memory dooms it. That&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s fault for low-balling the RAM but there&#8217;s nothing they can do about that now.</p>
<blockquote> The lack of memory dooms it. That’s Apple’s fault for low-balling the RAM but there’s nothing they can do about that now.</blockquote> <p>iPad 1 has the same ram as the iphone 3gs, and even better cpu than the 3gs, so that is BS.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t get ios4 for 6 months after iphone got it. But you&#8217;re right. Eventually we did get it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just tired of people thinking Apple will support their products forever.</p>
<p>This is how businesses work. They want you to buy the latest and greatest so they will stop supporting older products.</p>
<p>Google does the same thing for their nexus phones. Nexus s got ICS and Jellybean. That&#8217;s 2 major software updates. Same thing with Microsoft. Mango and Tango. <br />
It&#8217;s become the norm to support the product for 2 updates and then let it die.</p>
<p>So just do your research before saying Apple updates while Google does not.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t support them forever, but the worst Apple device in terms of support is as good as the best Android device &#8211; as you just implicitly acknowledged by comparing the support of the iPad-1 with that of the Nexus-S</p>
<p>Wait, the Nexus S. Single core, 512MB phone from 2010 is considered the best android device?</p>
<p>that is BS and taking an apologists view of Android&#8217;s problems. My galaxy tab 10.1 and 8 are more than capable of running ICS but they aren&#8217;t getting it. It only released a couple months before ICS debut prompting Samsung to say the hardware is &#8220;incapable&#8221;; except that XDA puts ICS on them just fine; even adding some bells and whistles in some builds. Many of the older phones not receiving updates also are running perfectly with XDA roms.</p>
<p>This goes completely counter to your suggestion that in Android, we don&#8217;t get updates because the hardware is incapable. I can guarantee even the old snapdragon-level devices can run ics just fine.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t the galaxy tab 10.1 get the update a few days ago?</p>
<p>I feel like 2.3.3 is like the IE6 of the Android world lol.</p>
<p>no, that honor belongs to Eclair</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say more like Windows XP.</p>
<p>Too bad my photon isn&#8217;t part of the 4.0+ club. Motorola please integrate into Google faster !</p>
<p>I am the  .08%</p>
<p>of the .08% of the .08% of the 0.8%  of people with jellybean<br />
Yeah that sounds accurate enough.</p>
<p>If one person is 0.8 percent of 0.8 percent it means there are only 15625 JellyBean devices out there.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound quite right!</p>
<p>It would also mean that the total number of Android devices is 1,953,125.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound quite right either!</p>
<p>If we assume at least 60% of the 400 million Android phone sold are still active, 0.8 percent means that <em><strong>there are almost 2 million JellyBean devices in the wild.</strong></em></p>
<p>That means you&#8217;re actually closer to 0.8 percent of 0.8 percent of 0.8 percent of the 0.8 percent of people running JellyBean.</p>
<p>Me too. I feel special.</p>
<p>We are the 1%</p>
<p>thanks to that hashcode dude&#8230;.</p>
<p>please change your avatar. It&#8217;s quite disturbing.</p>
<p>It works .08 percent of the time, every time&#8230;</p>
<p>Google needs to do some quality control on these things. Not going to happen, but the number of times my friends have rolled back because of various problems isn&#8217;t exactly low.</p>
<p>Samsung or HTC need to start giving people a period of support. 1.5/2 years from launch would be good. Hopefully the others will follow if that happens. I know a lot of people don&#8217;t care that much, but as soon as they hear about an iPhone or WP update everyone looks at their phone and thinks &#8220;mine hasn&#8217;t had an update for a year&#8221;. (Looking at you LG)</p>
<p>They already do quality control on all phones with Google play access. Sadly, it&#8217;s mostly concentrated on things that hurt their ad business, rather than customers. Skyhook+Motorola fiasco is great example.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you a story guys. <br />
Last year I recommend the SGSII to a friend. He bought it.  Now after a year I saw him again. He then asked me some things about his phone. During that process I checked his Android version. 2.3.3 He didn&#8217;t update that phone once since he bought it.  Then I had to show him how to update via Kies because the OTA function wasn&#8217;t built in in this early build. Now finally he has 4.0.3.</p>
<p>Now wonder is Android 4.0.3 not coming if there are so many uneducated people out there. It&#8217;s not even entirely Samsungs fault they gave the option through Kies which is rubbish if you could&#8217;ve OTAs straight from the beginning but nonetheless the option for updating was available. <br />
If people would at least care a bit about their gadgets we would&#8217;ve far less problems.</p>
<p>Also, speaking of the issue, I know sooooo many people with iPhones still stuck on iOS version that their phone came with!</p>
<p>Far far fewer, in fact I&#8217;ve never met one &#8211; even my sister who is still rocking an iPhone 3G is using iOS 3.  iPhone users historically plugged in to iTunes to get media, and got upgraded as a matter of course.   Nowadays they don&#8217;t even need to do that of course.</p>
<p>Luckily, the same OS that doesn&#8217;t need iTunes gets OTA updates.  It&#8217;s getting people to get over the &#8220;iOS 4 hump&#8221; that&#8217;s the biggest problem :)</p>
<p>Nice to see a decent jump in ICS numbers but 16% from Oct-Aug is poor.</p>
<p>OMG it&#8217;s 0.8% with newest update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And people are crying about wp not getting wp8.</p>
<p>Egh, I have a GSM Galaxy Nexus and it still hasn&#8217;t updated to Jelly Bean. What&#8217;s the hold up ?</p>
<p>Is it a Google-updated device or a Samsung-updated device? If you&#8217;re not seeing an update, likely it&#8217;s a localized Samsung-updated device, and you can flash over to the Google-updated stock ROM.</p>
<p>The only reason I bought the Galaxy Nexus over other Android phones was that it&#8217;s a Google Experience, and this sucks.</p>
<p>How do I know if it&#8217;s a Google device or a Samsung device? And while I know flashing instructions are all over the internet, how do i backup my info? (calls, sms, etc)</p>
<p>Mam I hate Android &#8230;</p>
<p>Man* damn no edit button</p>
<p>Use this app to check where you get your updates from<br />

<p>Also here is an app that can backup your calls and sms to gmail<br />

<p>It is highly suspicious not to list the actual numbers instead of percents.  They obviously are afraid of revealing the true number of Android devices that developers can sell to instead of the often quoted number of &#8220;android&#8221; devices activated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a conspiracy!  There&#8217;s really only 12 android devices in the whole world.</p>
<p>I think ICS was a special case where it was such a large update, it left a lot of once flagship devices in the dust. Even those that could handle the upgrade took absolutely forever to release. On the otherhand, the jump from 4 to 4.1 doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of a problem from what i hear from developers. I expect this upgrade to be adopted much faster.</p>
<p>At this point it&#8217;s probably safe to say it doesn&#8217;t really matter much. It sucks for developers but users don&#8217;t seem to care. People are walking into stores and leaving with 2.x devices today. If they&#8217;re happy with them I guess that&#8217;s fine.  If you look at the cell phone market before the iPhone significant software updates for devices was rare. This is just business as usual.</p>
<p>When is the Prime getting it? Anyone?</p>
<p>Very high level and preliminary analysis to possible Nexus 7 sales figures.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/27/850k-android-activations-daily-300m-total-devices-says-andy-rubin/">300M Android devices on 2/27/2012</a> (if a more recent figure exists please let me know)</p>
<p>850k activations daily means there is potentially a total of 433M Android devices out there (assuming no increase in activation rate)</p>
<p>0.8% Jelly Bean on Android devices means there are 3.464M Jelly Bean devices&#8230;which leads me to believe it is an acceptable assumption to state 1-2M Nexus 7 devices have been sold and activated.</p>
<p>All in all that sounds awesome, go Nexus 7! Again this is very preliminary with few figures and sources to support the findings.</p>
<p>I misinterpreted and thought this post said only the Nexus 7 and Xoom tablets have Jelly Bean&#8230;that means these figures are probably completely erroneous&#8230;my bad.</p>
<p>Well I guess the .08 percent means the Nexus devices. Because unless you&#8217;re rooted, nobody has released it yet.</p>
<p>Well it could also mean some of those other devices that have an early preview build or kang of CM10. But yes, I envision a majority of that is Nexus devices. We probably won&#8217;t see significant share of JB until the end of the year (or next year).</p>
<p>I am finally in the .8 %! Once you go Nexus you can&#8217;t go back.</p>
<p>2.3 will likely be around for a while considering prepaid market is massive and most of their phones are GB.</p>
<p>The madness continues. I hope there&#8217;s a settlement soon so we can put an end to all of this crap.</p>
<p>The only people losing in this whole battle are consumers.</p>
<p>By next year we will probably hear that Android has 85 to 90% of the smartphone market. Even with settlement, Apple will not reverse that, at least any time soon. They may get a deal like a part of revenue amount on each devices. But those devices will not bear the Apple logo and that got to hurt them.</p>
<p>Maybe with Steve Jobs&#8217; Apple, but not now. As long as the moneys rolling in, who cares where its from?</p>
<p>And you know this how? Android currently has 68% of the global market. The iPhone has around 17%, a number which dipped in Q3 2012 as people waited for the new iPhone. As usual, Apple has already announced record sales and record devices moved for the iPhone 5- which means that number will probably climb a bit. The truth remains that Samsung and Apple are the only two OEMs in the smartphone market who are making any serious money. Market share is a meaningless number in this case- you&#8217;re talking about one (new) phone on one company competing with dozens of new devices from several other companies around the world. And you act as if this decline in market share means that Apple&#8217;s somehow on the way out- again, they&#8217;re posting record sales and record profits all the time. Even if they shrink down to 10% of the smartphone market, they can still be immensely popular. They seem to be very comfortable with the roughly 10% Macs have held for years now, a number which is recently closer to 13% and is also growing all the time.</p>
<p>Apple investors lost $132,000,000,000 with Apple since Sep &#8217;12 in market cap alone. Do you really think their profits matter in light of that? And I remember how two years ago it was &#8220;Hey, iOS still has so much more market share, Android will never even come close to that&#8221;, same thing they still said about tablets a year ago. In a year, it will be &#8220;The GS4 only sells more than the iPhone, but the iOS Apps are still way better so it does not matter&#8221;, and a year later it will be &#8220;iPhones still have the highest profit margins&#8221;.</p>
<p>Realism written all over it. Funny, cuz it&#8217;s the inevitable truth. Post-Steve Apple will be very interesting, especially with Ive taking the reigns on the iOS software as well.</p>
<p>Umm, global Android marketshare is at 73%, not 68%. Apple is a premium player, their smartphone marketshare will probably recede to percentages similar to their Macs, not because their sales numbers will decline, but because the market will grow in the budget and midrange categories, and Apple won&#8217;t really address those segments because it stands to lose it&#8217;s premium veneer.</p>
<p>Good analysis.  Just to play devil&#8217;s advocate here is a counter argument i literally read this morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-market-share-2012-11" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-market-share-2012-11</a></p>
<p>Apple already plays in those markets by selling their two previous models.  The iPhone 4 is free with contract these days.  The way they crippled the older models by reducing storage capacity on them was lousy, but it&#8217;s how they push people to the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d have to sell successfully in 85-90 % of the global market. They don&#8217;t, and given  Apple&#8217;s business practice &#8211; they never will.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why Samsung is continually on the up?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crazy how much share they have gotten. By next year, Android will have done to iOS what Windows did to Mac OS decades ago.<br />
And they do it the same way too, just that this time even the openness is included so no &#8220;Linux&#8221; kind of OS is necessary.</p>
<p>Your comment is deliciously ironic considering that Android runs on the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Apart from you being incorrect about Linux, you are right Android will do to iOS what Windows did to Mac&#8230; and Apple will probably end up with a hugely profitable 5-10% of the market and Android will have ~90% with a few percentage points for the &#8216;others&#8217;</p>
<p>People seem to forget that marketshare numbers are typically seasonal with iPhone releases.  Q3 is Apple&#8217;s worst quarter right now because it is the tail end of the product cycle.  Keep in mind that in Q3, 45% of Verizon smartphone sales were iPhone and over 75% of AT&amp;T smartphone sales were iPhone.  Also keep in mind that the world-wide numbers for Android are based on estimates by analysts since no Android manufacturer reports quarterly sales numbers on Android smartphones.</p>
<p>If you look at the full year rather than quarters, you can factor out seasonality.  World-wide iPhone is sitting at about 20% to 25% on an annual basis (when you include the monster quarters following an iPhone release).  However, iPhone has very little penetration in markets like China, India, and Brazil because Apple is just now rolling out iPhone in those markets on a larger scale.</p>
<p>The market in India alone represents a huge base for Samsung.  But the Android phones that are selling in India are very low-cost smartphones to account for the currency conversion and average income.  Apple will never compete with those models in much the same way that Porsche will never compete with GM&#8217;s economy cars.  Sure GM builds the Corvette, Cadillacs, and Yukons on the high-end, but they also produce a lot of low-end stuff.  The low-end stuff will outsell the flagship models in large quantities.</p>
<p>Samsung is like GM &#8212; they cover the whole spectrum.  Other Android manufacturers specifically attack the low-end market in China and India and don&#8217;t bother competing with the flagship phones.  Apple only produces a flagship model.</p>
<p>The marketshare of &#8220;flagship&#8221; phones looks very different.  And the US market showing such a high percentage of iPhone on the two largest carriers in iPhone&#8217;s worst quarter is telling because the US market tends to buy the flagship smartphones from the top manufacturers.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p>1) Android market share cannot be determined because no manufacturer reports numbers on a quarterly basis (I wonder why that is).  All we have are estimates that have not been grounded in actual numbers for three years.</p>
<p>2) iPhone market share in a flagship-model-heavy market like the USA is extremely high.</p>
<p>3) Does anybody really care about $40 off-contract phones that get loaded with Gingerbread to run the Calendar app?  If Apple gave away an iPhone that had iOS but could only run the built-in apps and it had a cruddy processor and hardware, would anybody consider that &#8220;iOS market share&#8221;?  Probably not.</p>
<p>Market share can be reported, and is being reported, it&#8217;s about 70% worldwide and as much as iOS sells more each year&#8230; Android sells even more than that.</p>
<p>Unless WP8 gains traction&#8230; and I don&#8217;t see anyone talking about it outside of paid bloggers, shills and tech jerk-circle site then Android&#8217;s growth in share will carry on.</p>
<p>this doesn&#8217;t mean Apple&#8217;s declining, it&#8217;s still selling its phones in ever increasing numbers &#8211; it&#8217;s just that everyone else is too.</p>
<p>To determine market share you need unit sale numbers.  The only manufacturer providing those on a quarterly basis is&#8230;. wait for it&#8230;. Apple.  So what is being reported is estimates from analysts on what they tried to reverse from revenue numbers to try guess a profit margin on an average device without knowing which devices are considered Android smart phones.  So no&#8230; an accurate market share number cannot be reported, but is likely in the 60% to 70% range currently as a best guess and probably closer to 50% when you factor out the garbage phones.</p>
<p>If you look at the top-end devices&#8230;. Samsung sold 30M Galaxy S3&#8217;s in 5 months (we don&#8217;t know which quarter and our best guess is 6M per month which yields about 18M last quarter).  That was the first quarter Samsung had the S3 in a significant number of markets (including the USA) and they sold 18M units (this is an actual hard number we have &#8212; one of the few).  In that same quarter, Apple&#8217;s aging iPhone 4S sold about the same number of units with the iPhone 5 tacking on another 8M units on top of that for a total of 26M units.</p>
<p>We know for a fact that HTC&#8217;s One X sold badly despite it being a high-quality phone (my personal favorite Android phone) &#8212; we know this from revenue numbers.  We also know that Nexus devices like the Galaxy Nexus sold in small quantities from the court documents showing it was no threat to Apple.  That leaves us with Motorola RAZR/RAZR MAXX and then a host of garbage phones to compare against.</p>
<p>This is my point.  I&#8217;m not going to compare iPhone to some $40 Android phone sold in a third-world country because that $40 Android phone does not matter to anybody except Google&#8217;s activation count.  That $40 phone is not going to sway app developers and it is not going to translate into ecosystem or platform dominance.  That $40 phone is also not going to garner any product loyalty when said owner saves up enough to buy a flagship phone.</p>
<p>I will however compare BMW&#8217;s to Mercedes to Teslas to Audis to Corvette &amp; Cadillac and to Acura, Infiniti and Lexus.  Those models of cars are what are pushing the market forward.  They are what is going to appear in Motor Trend magazine.  They are the vehicles we care about.  In the smartphone market the ones that matter are iPhone 5, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note, Nexus 4, HTC One X/X+, HTC Droid DNA, and Motorola Droid RAZR/MAXX.  Of that group, only the first two are huge sellers with the third one being significant.  Nexus 4 would be the first Nexus device to sell well if it does, but Nexus is typically not a volume phone.  RAZR/MAXX did well in the USA, but not so much world-wide.</p>
<p>So yes, the overall &#8220;market share&#8221; estimate is extremely misleading because it includes all the cruft that gets sold in India and China that is targeted at folks who cannot afford the flagship devices that drive the market forward.  These phones are not going to garner customer loyalty or entice app developers to develop the great apps.  On the same note, Ford&#8217;s best selling car in the 1980s and 1990s was the Ford Escort &#8212; but nobody cared because it sold well because it was cheap &#8212; not because it was great.  If anything the Escort caused more people to swear off owning another Ford than it garnered in repeat purchases.</p>
<p>So if it&#8217;s not premium it doesn&#8217;t matter?  I get the point you&#8217;re making, but I think you&#8217;re being dismissive about &#8220;budget&#8221; products/services.  Look at the distribution of wealth and you&#8217;ll see it clearly.  $20 in groceries for you might include 1 lb of an expensive premium cut of steak for 1 dinner.  $20 in groceries for someone on a budget might include a months worth of Top Ramen.  Top Ramen may not be &#8220;pushing the market forward&#8221; but it&#8217;s certainly keeping those people alive.</p>
<p>And millions of high end devices mean nothing&#8230;. nothing at all.<br />
Android will be the top dog and no matter why that happened saying that it doesn&#8217;t matter is just plain stupid.</p>
<p>Or you are???</p>
<p>Remember what the PC and it&#8217;s compatible clones did to Apple, Amiga and Commodore. Open and commoditized will always zerg rush closed and custom designed. In 5 years time, Android (or less likely, Windows 8/9) will dominate the smartphone and tablet markets much like Windows dominates the desktop today.</p>
<p>MP3 players played out that way too, right?  Hmm&#8230; maybe not.</p>
<p>When all the OEMs were selling PCs with Windows, they were competing against Microsoft selling a bargain-basement version, right?  Oh yeah&#8230; that was not the case either even though Google sells Nexus 4 (and Nexus 7) dirt cheap.</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; I just remembered the similarity between smartphones and PCs&#8230;. Smartphone OEMs have tons of sales reps and account managers pushing their hardware into to businesses and schools and ensuring that if you want to remain relevant you have to have a compatible device because the ecosystem is not compatible or open&#8230;. Oh darn&#8230;I&#8217;m wrong again.  Android is open&#8230; anybody can plugin&#8230; there is no hard tie-in to businesses or schools.  And most businesses have moved to a &#8220;bring your own device&#8221; model.</p>
<p>The PC coup was brilliant because it was NOT open.  It relied on a closed ecosystem that required you have a Windows device to be compatible.  Those compatibility barriers don&#8217;t exist today for Android.  On the other hand, Apple is selling iPads to schools and businesses and integrating that with their Macs and creating a tie-in whereby you have to buy their products to be compatible.</p>
<p>If anybody is playing the game that Microsoft played years ago with Windows, it is Apple.  Except Apple is not leveraging partners for the hardware, they are building it themselves.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying that comparing smartphones to PC&#8217;s is even less correct than comparing smartphones to tablets.  These markets play out different because of very different dynamics.  While Google is licensing their OS to many manufacturers like Microsoft did, they are not creating exclusive tie-ins that require an Android device in order to play.  The likelihood that smartphones will play out like PC&#8217;s of the 80s and 90s is very low.</p>
<p>Microsoft flubbed MP3 players because it couldn&#8217;t find a way to link Office or Exchange to them. Hindsight is 20/20, but their path to success has historically been through the enterprise, and not through the home user. They&#8217;re learning their lesson, but it may yet be too late for them, the success or failure of Windows 8 (on tablets and smartphones) will tell.<br />
I&#8217;m not saying that Android will have a lock on the industry the way Windows locked the desktop market up, but just that they (or Windows 8/9 who knows) will be the marketshare leader, although I expect Apple to consistently get higher margins with their premium sector of the market.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s bread and butter used to be the premium market, but they have really changed their focus to the masses.</p>
<p>The greatest tie-in that Microsoft had going for it back in the day was that if you used a PC at work then you wanted a PC at home.  My second computer (after my Atari 400) was an Apple IIc that I bought with my paper route money because the school had Apple computers and I wanted something <strong>compatible</strong> at home.</p>
<p>These days, so much is done on the web at school that your brand of computer is irrelevant.  There is no lock-in setup.  The key factor in this decade is going to be tie-in across your devices.  Every device can get to the web and get Gmail, or Yahoo mail or hotmail.  For work, devices all do exchange mail.  The differentiating factor will be how well devices and computers give you a seamless client.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s approach is that on the device they integrate directly to their services, but on the PC (or Chromebook) you have to use the browser to get to your stuff.  That is why Chromebook makes the browser a part of the OS, but the experience is degraded nonetheless.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s model is that the device/computer is the gateway to the cloud, not the browser.  It looks the same as Google on tablets and smartphones, but Apple ties in the Mac very well with Mountain Lion.</p>
<p>Microsoft is the only company that is in a position to do what Apple is doing with a seamless client because they have a presence (a massive one) on the desktop.  The problem is that their presence is slipping away because they clung to the lock-in they created years ago for too long.  And their presence in mobile is horribly lacking.</p>
<p>Consider DropBox&#8230;. it is widely popular, but DropBox made sure that it behaved natively on each device.  DropBox only makes you use the Web browser to get to your files when you are at somebody else&#8217;s computer.  Otherwise it looks like part of the native operating system.  This is why Apple tried to acquire DropBox &#8212; because they were completely inline with Apple&#8217;s strategy.</p>
<p>What is the achilles heel in all of this?  Apple of years ago trumpeted &#8220;open architecture&#8221; because they needed it to thwart Microsoft.  Google has trumpted it recently.  In practice neither wants to be open except where it will hurt their competitor.  However, the general populous has demanded some things be open because they don&#8217;t want to be locked in again like they were with Microsoft (which is a bad sign for Microsoft, considering the bad memories it has caused for many).  The amount of openness today from each vendor makes the Microsoft-style PC Judo move of the 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s near-impossible today.</p>
<p>Of all companies, Apple is currently in the best possible position to deliver a seamless client.  Let&#8217;s look at how they stack up:</p>
<p>Google &#8212; Huge smartphone presence, no PC install base with Chromebook and very small tablet presence</p>
<p>Microsoft &#8211; Huge PC presence, but no mobile install base (smartphone or tablet)</p>
<p>Samsung &#8211; Huge smartphone presence, small tablet presence, and significant PC presence but does not own or dictate underlying operating systems (Android on mobile and Windows on PC)</p>
<p>Apple &#8211; Significant and growing PC presence, dominant tablet presence, and significant smartphone presence (and huge presence among premium buyers).</p>
<p>Quite honestly, I am bit surprised that it is not Microsoft who is in the dominant position today.  Microsoft was the company that was best poised to deliver the complete solution just 10 short years ago.</p>
<p>In the consumer space, Apple executes much better than Microsoft, and their vision regarding smartphones and tablets  was superior to Microsoft&#8217;s. But at the end of the day, it&#8217;s all about market share. The platform with the largest marketshare will win, no matter how cohesive or well designed a smaller platform is. Not to say that Apple is in danger of closing down any time soon, just that soon developers will not be able to ignore Android in favour of iOS, not when the sheer volume of Android users outweighs the deeper wallets of iOS customers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure a billion dollars out of Samsung&#8217;s pocket is a pretty big loss for them.</p>
<p>Which is far from settled!</p>
<p>I think they can comfortably take the hit, its the implications after that should worry them more</p>
<p>Small change compared to their growth to the top of the tree.</p>
<p>$1bn well invested, really. but given the fact their infringement of trade dress appears to have just cascaded down to other points in the case which don&#8217;t appear to have received due care &amp; attention along with possible improper influence the actual amount is still open to process given the judge hasn&#8217;t ruled.</p>
<p>If they chalk it up to R&amp;D it is nothing.  That $1B helped them to overtake HTC and position themselves as the the premier Android OEM and the alternative to Apple.</p>
<p>And this useless farce continues.<br />
Just kiss and make up already.</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; I was optimistic when HTC settled, but Samsung said &#8220;no thanks&#8221; to that.  I am still hoping for a general settlement between Apple and Google that Android manufacturers can partake in providing they drop all lawsuits.  This would amount to Google paying the &#8220;license fees&#8221; via access to some of their services for Apple devices.</p>
<p>I am really tired of these lawsuits &#8212; they are distracting.</p>
<p>Samsung said &#8220;no thanks&#8221; to a ridiculous price, where even WP7 devices were on the list of infringers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just talking about the news from two days ago where Samsung said they have no interest in settling.</p>
<p>Is there no light at the end of this tunnel?</p>
<p>No. At this point even the light of God won&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p>It just never ends&#8230;</p>
<p>Actually, better yet: <em><strong>&#8220;ENNNNNNNNNND ENNNNNNNNNNND!!!&#8221;</strong></em> &#8211; Tom Servo</p>

<p>So Google doesn&#8217;t sell the Galaxy Nexus anymore and it is now on 4.2.  Way to keep up Apple.</p>
<p>Yup. Apple is so ahead of the game. /s</p>
<p>Lol, Android&#8217;s release cycle moves faster than Apple&#8217;s lawyers</p>
<p>Actually it&#8217;s the legal process that the release cycle moves faster than.</p>
<p>Common mis-quote of the Apple lawyer.</p>
<p>Apple will not stop.<br />
It has vowed to kill Android.</p>
<p>Thermonuclear, brah.</p>
<p>It MIGHT have to wait ten years until its cross patent agreement with HTC expires.</p>
<blockquote>It has vowed to kill Android.</blockquote>
<p>From the death count it looks like Android is ahead 1 to 0.</p>
<p>Sorry man but Steve Jobs ≠ Apple.<br />
Flag and carry on.</p>

<p>5th row and crappy maps wont do it. Work harder.</p>
<p>Lol&#8230; it&#8217;s doing a great job&#8230; up to 70% share worldwide and that because US&#8230; elsewhere it&#8217;s up to 80%+</p>
<p>I wonder how all this litigation is affecting the product prices from both companies right now.</p>
<p>Good question</p>
<p>Ban all the devices.</p>
<p>That would be hilarious.  Judge rules a double ban.  Both companies are like what the fuck.  Lose billions.</p>
<p>I would love to see this happening. Maybe then they would stop with this childishness.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness I want to see what people are gonna buy if both devices are banned!</p>
<p>WIN. phones.</p>
<p>Nexus 4.</p>
<p>These lawsuits are going to happen indefinitely, so I&#8217;m hoping that the overall result is futile for both companies, with nobody making or losing money from these lawsuits over the long-term.  Actually, both companies would lose due to lawyer costs, and loss of time.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the specifics of the case, but I hope Samsung wins this one so that the &#8220;score&#8221; is 1-1.  <em><strong>shrugs shoulders</strong></em></p>
<p>You forgot one thing.  Someone always wins from virtually any lawsuit: the lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>sigh</strong></p>
<p>Is there a VERGE.com/nopatentBS? &#8230;..I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>Ugh, I cant see this going on anymore, were all going to see the effects of their battles sooner or later. Trust me.</p>
<p>Apple you&#8217;re going to self-implode trying to eliminate the competition.  Your time and resources are better served modernizing iOS, making your services more stable, fixing maps, innovating your own hardware tech instead of relying on off-the-shelf components, etc.  You&#8217;re just a white box assembler like Dell and look at their earnings trend.</p>
<p>Their stock is in freefall and their losing lawsuits around the world.  Their also on the hook for Billions for blatantly using Motorola patents without compensation for years.</p>
<p>*they&#8217;re</p>
<p>Apple is the most successful UNIX vendor. They make nearly everything from processors to the programming language most of their OS is coded in . They are the exact opposite of a white box assembler.</p>
<p>Can I get some of what you&#8217;re smoking?</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t make processors. They don&#8217;t even make their own phones. It&#8217;s all contracted out to Foxconn, Samsung, etc.</p>
<p>So AMD doesn&#8217;t make processors, that&#8217;s your position?</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re talking about AMD now?  Nice strawman.</p>
<p>The strawman is pretending like manufacturing is the only part of creation. You clearly wouldn&#8217;t claim AMD doesn&#8217;t make processors but if they make processors so does Apple.</p>
<p>AMD now designs processors and contracts the fabrication to GlobalFoundries. Unlike, AMD, Apple licences the ARM architecture and customizes it for their needs.  In terms of complexity, AMD easily outclasses the jigsaw puzzle Apple assembles.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re quite wrong, check out the Swift processor in the A6. Apple designed, manual layout (something AMD doesn&#8217;t do), and altogether awesome. Not a licensed ARM core, an independently designed ARM processor made by Apple and currently fabbed by Samsung.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s still inferior to Qualcomm&#8217;s S4 with the Adreno 320.</p>
<p>That is completely irrelevant to the discussion you and the above poster were having. Also, it&#8217;s incorrect. Real world benchmarks place the Swift well ahead of the S4 in performance.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re thinking of the S4 Pro rather than the regular S4, but even so, Apple&#8217;s SoC still comes out on top.<br />
<a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6440/google-nexus-4-review/3" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6440/google-nexus-4-review/3</a></p>
<p>Dafaq? Apple-designed A6 no matter how brilliant it is doesn&#8217;t make Apple the manufacturer</p>
<p>It seems you&#8217;re not up to date with Apple&#8217;s processors. With the A4 and A5, you are correct in saying that they merely used tweaked ARM processors (Cortex-A8 and Cortex-A9, respectively) but that is not so with the A6. The Apple A6 SoC has a CPU that was actually designed and laid out by Apple. It&#8217;s referred to as &#8216;Swift&#8217;.</p>
<p>Apple is absolutely a chip designer now. You can read a lot more about this on Anandtech. <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/4" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/4</a></p>
<p>&#8220;By far the most exciting aspect of this news is the fact that the A6′s <b>dual ARM CPU cores</b> have been manually laid out&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/136749-iphone-5-a6-soc-reverse-engineered-reveals-rare-hand-made-custom-cpu-and-a-tri-core-gpu" target="_blank">http://www.extremetech.com/computing/136749-iphone-5-a6-soc-reverse-engineered-reveals-rare-hand-made-custom-cpu-and-a-tri-core-gpu</a></p>
<p>As well as numerous other references.  It&#8217;s still ARM-based.</p>
<p>Yes, Apple design chips, they don&#8217;t manufacture them,<br />
Samsung designs chips AND manufactures them.</p>
<p>In no version of this is Apple superior to Samsung.</p>
<p>The Samsung processors (eg Exynos) are custom but not to the same extent as the A6. They are more comparable to the A5.</p>
<p>The Exynos SoC uses ARM Cortex-A9. Apple created their own architecture instead of using existing ones (eg A9 or A15).</p>
<p>They used the ARM instruction set but created their own architecture, which is technically more bespoke than what Samsung did.</p>
<p>Ah I see now. But GPU&#8217;s aside, is the A6 a better implementation than the Exynos 5? &#8211; Or more specifically&#8230; is whatever Apple did to the ARM architecture better than a Cortex A-15?. It looks to me like  A6 pulls ahead because of the PowerVR SGX 543 instead of CPU</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think what Apple came up with is superior to the A-15, but then the A15 is very power hungry. Apples custom Swift core is somewhere between the A9 and the A15.</p>
<p>The A15&#8217;s aren&#8217;t in any phones to date, but if and when they are, they should represent a significant performance step up, provided they don&#8217;t have to be down-clocked too heavily.</p>
<blockquote>AMD now designs processors and contracts the fabrication to GlobalFoundries. Unlike, AMD, Apple licences the ARM architecture and customizes it for their needs. In terms of complexity, AMD easily outclasses the jigsaw puzzle Apple assembles.</blockquote>
<p>Apple did not license the ARM architecture and &#8216;customise it&#8217;. They don&#8217;t use any ARM architecture.</p>
<p>They licensed the ARM instruction set, and developed a completely bespoke architecture based on that.</p>
<p>So isn&#8217;t Google or Microsoft. Your point?</p>
<p>Did you miss it? Apple manufactures squat. BTW, Motorola has plants. Your point?</p>
<p>Why do people care whether Apple buys a factory or pays a supplier who owns a factory?</p>
<p>Right, because the millions they&#8217;re spending on lawyers is a huge drain that prevents them from spending the billions and billions and billions they have in the bank on the things you mentioned. Scott Forstall is gone. &#8220;Modernizing&#8221; iOS, whatever that means, is coming.</p>
<p>Call me shortsighted, but I just dont know HOW can JB be included into this, specially when its the STOCK version&#8230;.</p>
<p>Software patents.  Since Apple was suing the Gnex only for a software patent regarding universal search, they have the right to include android 4.1 in this. Even so, it&#8217;s still downright ridiculous that Apple is allowed to do this for such a silly reason.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to say that Samsung is good in this situation, they are just as bitchy as Apple right now when it comes to suing each other&#8217;s products for stupid patents. They should have ended it back in 2011 with the S2 (which in my honest opinion, was the last product Samsung made that looked a bit like an Apple product).</p>
<p>wasnt Universal search removed from Android following the JB upgrade?  heck wasnt that feature remove in one of the minor updates for ICS?</p>
<p>This is far too ridiculous, if you had told me that atleast the lawsuit was for TouchWiz JB then I would understand due to the similarity between the UI in TouchWiz to iOS,  but Stock Android is pretty far from iOS, and if thats the case shouldn&#8217;t they sue HTC, Motorola, LG Huawei and Panasonic considering they all have atleast ONE device that runs stock Android&#8230; and they all have devices that run JB</p>
<p>Please God, can this crap just finish already&#8230;</p>
<p>In a way I kind of hope these do carry on fighting, as hopefully the more it continues, the more obvious the need for reform becomes&#8230;</p>
<p>Things like these have always been going on the business world, and always will. It&#8217;s only lately that they have been sensationalised by the press. Any story with &#8220;Apple&#8221; in the headlines seems to lead to a click fest and controversial ones doubly so.</p>
<p>I reckon the Apple related patent battles have lost their entertainment value now, and blogs and news outlets should just drop the topic. If they don&#8217;t then only their readership can convince them otherwise, by ignoring the stories.</p>
<p>Boy, this is getting tiring. Can&#8217;t they just kiss and make up?</p>
<p>The title is misleading and the story does not clear it up that well. Apple failed to add Jelly Bean as a whole. <br />
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20121116064034987" target="_blank">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20121116064034987</a></p>
<p>Only to this particular case, not in general.</p>
<ul>
	<li>YAWN *</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing better out there right now. . . These are standard specs.</p>
<p>Makes sense, the previous note didn&#8217;t improve on internals either. It&#8217;s just another form factor of the existing flagship. Nothing wrong with these specs though.</p>
<p>False</p>
<p>The OG note had a 1280 800 display.</p>
<p>Seriously, Samsung is all about screen. Would they really downgrade their resolution?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll  probably upgrade from PenTile to RGB, so the screen would be actually sharper. Hopefully.</p>
<p>PenTile does have a bad reputation, specially the early models, but the newer phones sporting it look great.</p>
<p>PenTile needs to die in a fire.  Never again should this hack be used.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good solution to increase the pixel count without increasing the cost of the display. Not so good for the consumer (who doesn&#8217;t benefit the cost saving).</p>
<p>They need to get rid of Super Amoled. The screen on the Original tab 10.1 is better than anything amoled in my opinion. Accurate colors, good white balance, and viewing angles. I moved from a Gnex to an evoLTE and the screen is day and night, Amoled sucks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hardly a downgrade, especially if they improve on other specs(like pentile vs RGB). Don&#8217;t just stare at the numbers, look at the screen for real and then judge how it looks. My guess is this screen will look a lot better and you&#8217;re not gonna mind the 80 pixel rows missing.</p>
<p>I know. But they can&#8217;t risk people talking about the new Note as having lower resolution. This is why I think the leak is fake.</p>
<p>And then there is the thing that 1280&#215;800 screens are often referred to as 720p displays, which someone might have translated to 1280&#215;720... for now I&#8217;m just going to ignore that part. It&#8217;s meaningless.</p>
<p>Press will start showing spec comparison charts and demonstrate that the resolution is lower. They will start writing articles on &#8220;5 Reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t upgrade to Note 2&#8221;. People do care about numbers. It may be &#8220;meaningless&#8221; to you but it certainly won&#8217;t be to the press and the general public.</p>
<p>Assuming it&#8217;s even true. Also, responsible press would not consider it a lower resolution. But mostly I said I would ignore it because it&#8217;s very well possible the res will be the same because of confusion of the term 720p. There&#8217;s no reason to be worried about it.</p>
<p>Also, I really don&#8217;t care what other people think about the resolution. I care about what makes a difference and whether this is a good device for me. If other people want to take 80 pixel rows that seriously, let them avoid the phone, it won&#8217;t make it any worse for me, so who cares. That said, I think most people who care about screen res also realize there is no difference to speak off here. Especially not if they switch to RGB.</p>
<p>The first Galaxy Note has an higher resolution^^ I hope they use the cortexA15 or the malit604</p>
<p>Exynos 5 would be amazing. I would get off this Qualcomm bandwagon I&#8217;m sitting on if they released a device with it.</p>
<p>Much better than any iphone that&#8217;s for sure. We all be YAWNING come September 12th.</p>
<p>Meh.. </p>
<p>CAN&quot;T WAIT to dump my GS3 for a phone with the exact same software!!!! . .  . . . . . . But on a more serious note &#8220;paul&#8221;, &#8220;paul&#8221; . . . just clearing my throat there. . . . if this comes to Sprint I may just Sell my GS3 for the hell of it and get a note to give it a test run for a few months&#8230;. then see what&#8217;s up with the new nexus Devices in the Fall&#8230; or CES in January.</p>
<p>How many phones have you gone through in the last 12 months?</p>
<p>Screen used to be 1280 &#215; 800, hm.</p>
<p>They may be going with on screen buttons and because of that use a taller screen res. Would also explain the slightly larger screen. I honestly can&#8217;t see them making the device any bigger than the original, but this way they can increase the screen size without changing the physical size of the device. It won&#8217;t change the usable screen size though and the slight decrease in ppi will most likely not be noticeable, especially if the screen is going to be better on other fronts.</p>
<p>I was hoping for the same but Samsung feels they have to keep that physical home button (for some reason).</p>
<p>I think they think it&#8217;s familiar to people who are used to the iPhone. But I hope they realize by now that Android works differently. (Not trying to troll here, but I think it&#8217;s part of their reasoning)</p>
<p>There have been rumors of an HTC phone with on screen buttons as well though, maybe OEMs are finally shying away from physical buttons. Maybe Google is nudging them towards on screen. One can always hope, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Note is closer to a tablet. It should definitely have onscreen buttons like their 7 inch tablet does. Another important point is that it is possible to hit the onscreen buttons with a stylus, but you can&#8217;t hit physical buttons with it.</p>
<p>I believe the capacitive buttons worked just fine, though the home button was a bit awkward on the original note. still works though, but you&#8217;d actually have to press in the button with the stylus, which just feels weird.</p>
<p>1280&#215;720 means they are changing the aspect ratio from 16:10 to 16:9. Even though the screen is .02&quot; bigger the 16:9 ratio means the phone won&#8217;t be any wider and could possibly be less wide than the original Note depending how much bezel there is. This is a supposed front glass panel of the Note 2.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/08/ecransamsunggalaxynote2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Here is the original Note&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techsnapr.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/White-Galaxy-Note-UK.jpg" /></p>
<p>Wtf isn&#8217;t it &#8220;normal&#8221; to ship with the latest os? Do we have to beg samsung? And pay?</p>
<p>The funny part of this statement is the current Galaxy S3 will see Jellybean August 29th then the Galaxy Note 2 will launch with jellybean what more can be expected. The Verizon Galaxy Nexus is still on ice cream sandwich 4.0.4 just like my current Galaxy S3. Samsung beat every other OEM to jellybean heck people are still trying to get ice cream sandwich to devices. Samsung pimp slaps apple and all OEM&#8217;S</p>
<p>I wonder if there&#8217;s any company out there that can truly innovate on hardware instead of just rehashing the same hardware with slight form factor variations :(</p>
<p>That usually tends to be expensive.  Sort of like the automobile industry.   There arent huge redesigns for models every yr. Usually every couple of yrs.</p>
<p>And yet the iPhone 4S was panned because it kept the same form factor.</p>
<p>only because everyone was claiming it was going to have a 4 inch screen. i&#8217;m surprised Apple didn&#8217;t manage that better</p>
<p>Well, there is a difference between slight form factor variation and no variation. The S4 was exactly the same and for people who want something fresh in design or people who want to brag about their new device, it doesn&#8217;t help that nobody can tell it&#8217;s new or it looks and feels like the phone you already have. Luckily most people are on a two year cycle, but I can understand how that can be annoying.</p>
<p>Man&#8230; everyone does that to a point then they change&#8230; If someone is buying Millions of you product you don&#8217;t  go randomly changing things every 6months&#8230; You let the Design run it&#8217;s course.</p>
<p>HTC 2011:<br />
<img src="http://htcsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/htc_vivid_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>HTC 2012:<br />
<img src="http://www.htc.com/managed-assets/www/smartphones/htc-one-x/marquee-v3/slide-1-white.png" /></p>
<p>This proves my point. It just shows a slightly different design, maybe better maybe not. Where is the hardware innovation? HTC 2013 can have a third design where the camera moves to the right and the body has a different shape&#8230; But it&#8217;s still a rehash.</p>
<p>What was that Kyocera dual screen device? How horrible was it?<br />
There will be no innovation for at least a year, because the new wave of technology isn&#8217;t there yet. You know there are constraints that we can&#8217;t disregard.</p>
<p>Is it sad that I first thought that was a close-up of a more highly detailed Nyan Cat?</p>
<p>Clearly. :)</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s a non-pentile screen, I&#8217;m disappointed, assuming these specs are true. We&#8217;ll see in a couple of days.</p>
<p>Antutu benchmark:</p>

<p>Yeah but they could both be fake. We still can&#8217;t say anything about it until the launch.</p>
<p>And why do these even leak? Why the fuck they can&#8217;t just use an offline benchmark app which doesn&#8217;t post anything publicly?</p>
<p>These are not mine tests. So, I have no clue whether they are real or fake.</p>
<p>Guess I won&#8217;t be changing my galaxy note then</p>
<p>I held out on the OG Note.  I&#8217;m more interested in the new features than hardware.</p>
<p>I could be persuaded to sell my SIII for a Note II&#8230;.depending on the specs&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on board.  SPRINT! GET ON THIS!  I WANT ONE!</p>
<p>How did they manage to fit the external LTE modem in their without making it too thick? Thats what I want to know.</p>
<p>Hopefully this rumor isn&#8217;t true. I was hoping to see their A15 chip introduced with the  galaxy note 2.</p>
<p>There will be many devices coming out with quad core S4 pro pretty soon. They will crush all samsung&#8217;s flagship devices. Plus, the screen is going to have a lower resolution. Anyway, I don&#8217;t really care about specs, so I&#8217;ll go for the new Nexus.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of calling it Jelly Bean when it will actually just be a butchered shadow Android&#8217;s stock experience?</p>
<p>The fact that the latest phone would not ship with the latest OS is actually a headline&#8230; is rather sad.</p>
<p>2GB Ram?</p>
<p>This is great, can&#8217;t wait to read it all!</p>
<p>LOL, I have owned 5 out of 6 of those phones. The only I didn&#8217;t get was the OG Droid.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of phones in a three-year span.  I&#8217;m only on #2, but I&#8217;ve extensively used every Android version listed.  Kept my G1 all the way up through CM6 and then got a Galaxy S.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t even any CM roms when went from the G1 to Google Ion in June 2009. I got it on Ebay after Google gave them away at IO.</p>
<p>An Ion wasn&#8217;t much of an upgrade.  That&#8217;s why I never got a MyTouch.  Same slow-as-heck last-generation Qualcomm processor.  Same crappy HVGA screen.  A bit more internal storage and RAM, but the CM-team had workarounds for all that jazz using unionfs and an SD card.</p>
<p>I remember&#8230;.</p>
<p>When the HTC Dream G1 was available an improved Motorola CLIQ was,<br />
Whilst the Nexus One was the most advanced and only unique,<br />
As the Nexus S made its debut a somewhat improved Galaxy S accompanied,<br />
With the XOOM tablet ASUS transformed all interest,<br />
As with the Galaxy Nexus, I can get a better handset in the form of a NOTE.<br />
What shall Android 5.0 Jellybean bring?</p>
<p>Jelly Bean will probably be 4.1 or 4.2.</p>
<p>good call!</p>
<p>On my phone it is running as Android 4.1.</p>
<p>The Cliq was garbage too.</p>
<p>OHHHHHH SNAPDRAGON!</p>
<p>I love your choice of icon, a combination of apple, Microsoft, and Google&#8217;s android. What a perfectly unifying choice.</p>
<p>I hope it annoys the trolls :)</p>
<p>Same here, in some ways I love my G1 more than my SGS, the pure Google experience was awesome as well as all the history. I remember first rooting and loading jesusfrekes ROMs, it was incredible.</p>
<p>Yeah, watching the G1 involved really was incredible.  The CM team made that thing jump through hoops and do tricks like you wouldn&#8217;t believe.</p>
<p>It was still a relief to finally upgrade to the SGS, but I do miss some things about the G1.  The keyboard, physical function keys, the stock Google experience.  I do have an AOSP ICS ROM right now on my SGS, but it&#8217;s kind of cranky.  What sold me on the SGS what that Samsung posted their drivers&#8217; source code on their dev site.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned 4 of the 6. I didn&#8217;t get the MyTouch or the Droid.</p>
<p>I have the OG Droid. It amazes me how well it has held up. Great screen, stock Android Froyo, solid as a rock. But come Friday I&#8217;m upping to a Nexus.</p>
<p>You are going to love it even more then me if you are coming from the OG Droid.</p>
<p>You would love everything the Gnex offers a lot more except:<br />
- less brighter screen<br />
- meaner masculine stance (aggressive edges, golden buttons)<br />
- quality used material (real steel feels solid and reassuring)<br />
- layout of buttons (power, volume and camera buttons are where they should be)<br />
- physical keyboard</p>
<p>I can agree with a few of the items in your list, but some I just dont understand and or completely disagree with.</p>
<p>Why would you want a LESS bright screen. Hell in sunny Florida, I could stand for it to be even brighter at times. Why not just use the brightness slider?</p>
<p>The power button layout on Samsung is PERFECT&#8230; I can no longer stand top mounted power buttons as they are in truth just not that ergonomic. The Samsung style happens to be placed exactly where your thumb rests for righties and where your index finger rests for lefties.</p>
<p>That makes two of us!!! I remember drooling after the original Droid, almost paid for the imported Milestone, but then Nexus One came along&#8230;<br />
I wish Google &amp; HTC would get back together. Loving the Galaxy Nexus and all, but that solid and handsome Nexus One is one of a kind! My favorite of the bunch!</p>
<p>Yeah I hear you. I kept my Nexus One close to me by giving it to my little sister but now she won&#8217;t let me touch it. :*(</p>
<p>Of the ones pictured I only had the first one.</p>
<p>Great article!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that it was just two years ago that I traded by Palm Treo for a G1.  Now, I&#8217;ve got a Droid 2, and I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting the Droid 4.</p>
<p>(Never giving up that physical keyboard!)</p>
<p>Same!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only owned two android devices a white Hero and now for the year ish a white Nexus S&#8230; weird thing is as far as I&#8217;m concerned I never had a mobile phone before my Hero even though my first phone was a Sony J6 way back in 2000/1. I think its because my phones become such an integral part of my day for reason outside its main function, namely phoning and texting people&#8230;</p>
<p>This is amazing. Nice job Chris.<br />
<img src="http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/GifGuide/clapping/tumblr_la2rp8bgAw1qa6ql2o1_500.gif" /></p>
<p>You guys are seriously killing it!! Keep up the great work!</p>
<p>But at the rate Google release substantive Android updates they are going to run out of horizontal room for those phones panning left-to-right pretty quick :)</p>
<p>Yea I actually like the full length page design better than the left-off center design.  Anyways it was an awesome read.</p>
<p>This is great, will read again.</p>
<p>This is practically a novel. Android has had a convoluted history! A Game of Phones.</p>
<p>If this is a novel, then what is the history of WinMo/WinPho going to be?</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>The high caliber of articles on this website continues to impress me. Can’t get enough material like this, Thanks Chris!</p>
<p>YEEEEEEEEE-AW, Ziggy! Great stuff. Reading through it now with glee.</p>
<p>Awesome stuff, Chris. Really impressed with how this site is really pushing the envelope and doing a lot of cool stuff.  If only Chris knew how to pronouce the word gaffe.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m sorry guys, but on the big picture it looks like the android phones look more like an iPhone with every iteration</p>
<p>Or iPhone looks more like Android :D</p>
<p>You mean iOS looks more like Android with each iteration.</p>
<p>you mean the slide-down drawer that wasn&#8217;t even android invention? :) compare this to ripping off every single mutlitouch gesture introduced in first iOS (iPhone OS) &#8230; homescreens, touch keyboard, copy&amp;paste and pretty much everything that defines touch based operating system</p>
<p>Well &#8220;everything that defined a touch based OS&#8221; existed before iOS.  iOS just did it well.</p>
<p>about the only pre-iOS touch technique was tap and visible slider</p>
<p>if you want to play that game.  You should read the wiki on multi-touch because  the technology began decades ago, in 1982. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch</a> Apple acquired Fingerworks and its multi-touch technology in 2005. &#8212; So they never invented anything, Apple just bought out the companies that did. Steve Jobs was a tweaker, not an inventor.</p>
<p>You know Android, was bought by Google, right?</p>
<p>Pretty sure he&#8217;s just replying to the tu quoque tangent that Formul&#8217;s desperately using to justify why iOS is/must be/has to be/will be better than the rest.</p>
<p>yes, thank you.</p>
<blockquote>Apple acquired Fingerworks and its multi-touch technology in 2005. — So they never invented anything, Apple just bought out the companies that did.</blockquote>
<p>And then Google simply replicated (for free) the work Apple paid for.  Stellar.</p>
<p>Apple, Google and Microsoft never invented anything if you get right down to it.  Even Dos was taken from someone else. Let&#8217;s just put this argument to bed.  Today they&#8217;re all taking cue&#8217;s from each other and trying to do it better.</p>
<blockquote>Steve Jobs was a tweaker, not an inventor.</blockquote>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t true when Malcolm Gladwell said it in the New Yorker, and it&#8217;s no truer now that you&#8217;re repeating it. By that definition, no one&#8217;s an inventor unless they build their stuff in a vacuum, unaware of the existence of any other technology. Ford didn&#8217;t invent the wheel (or the internal combustion engine, for that matter)&#8212;must be a tweaker.</p>
<p>Building ones own technology based on the idea of another is totally different than seeing technology one wants and buying it outright. To use your same analogy, Ford did not invent the wheel, but they put the car chassis together according to their own vision. The wheel did not NEED to be bought and it was only a small part of the overall idea. All internal combustion engines are not the same either, look at the inline-four cylinder versus the flat-four. These two engines run entirely different, and neither one of the inventors of these engines bought the idea for the original internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>When one buys a previous idea, they are saying that they do not want to create new technology, and they do not want to innovate. Instead they are taking existing technology and placing their own badge on it without making any major changes. The inventor of this technology is screwed in this scenario due to the lack of exposure is company, which does not exist at this point, gets.</p>
<p>also most of the stuff listed wasn&#8217;t invented by Google or Apple.  there&#8217;s a reason there is no successful lawsuit over any of the items you listed by either company</p>
<p>You realize other people come up with ideas too?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a logical user interface. Someone should attack every other OS for having a mouse. Further more the cursor is usually an ARROW.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what we got used to, and it&#8217;s ok that everyone else uses it because it&#8217;s what people expect.</p>
<p>Ideas shouldn&#8217;t be so protected, otherwise it stifles innovation. If someone copies your work, take it as a huge compliment and remember that you&#8217;re the one changing the industry. It will be reflected in your sales.</p>
<p>Then innovate before the competition and you&#8217;ll stay on top.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think companies deserve to stay on top because they innovate once, they have to keep moving along otherwise someone else with better ideas should be on top.</p>
<p>Not throw a lawsuit at anyone who tries to improve things. That&#8217;s just suffocating competition rather than actually beating it.</p>
<p>Copying isnt innovating, therefore preventing copying doesn&#8217;t stifle innovation, it stifles stealing.  I hate when people say &#8220;innovate don&#8217;t litigate.&#8221;  They should say &#8220;innovate don&#8217;t imitate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emulation != imitation</p>
<p>homescreens are completely different between iOS and Android. The use of widgets is a radical difference, as is the methods of customization.</p>
<p>Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but didn&#8217;t the first iPhone/iOS not have copy and paste? Did they copy that from blackberry? Or maybe straight from Windows?</p>
<p>A &#8220;touch keyboard&#8221;? Really? That&#8217;s no different than accusing someone of ripping off a physical keyboard design from the typewriter. You can&#8217;t seriously be accusing Android of ripping that off iOS can you? The G1 had a hardware keyboard, there was no need to initially have a touchscreen version. When the time came they added it. Should every computer not have a physical keyboard?</p>
<p>Seriously, who cares???  If you like Android, use it. If you like iOS, use that.  Why so much childish bickering?</p>
<p>Did my post have anything to do with that? All I did was address the flaws of his comment, not spout off some speech about how Android is so much better and everyone should use it.</p>
<p>I have no idea what you&#8217;re trying to say. I&#8217;m just suggesting that we&#8217;re not talking about life, death or even religion &#8211; we&#8217;re talking about phones. I don&#8217;t know why some people get so emotional about it, like your entire identity is wrapped up in which phone you choose to buy. It&#8217;s kind of sad.</p>
<p>And I still have no idea why your saying these things here, on my post lol. That&#8217;s all. I understand what you&#8217;re saying, and I agree with it, but I don&#8217;t understand why it was a reply to my post. Unless it was unintentional and meant to be a new comment.</p>
<p>Well said .</p>
<p>Did you really say home screens? and copy&amp;past!?! I really hope you&#8217;re joking.</p>
<p>1. Phones had home screens before the iPhone came out. Look at all Palm phones, Blackberrys, heck even feature phones.</p>
<p>2. Android got copy and paste before iOS.</p>
<p>So before Android, who was using the pull down notification?</p>
<p>Hahahah, cough, cough, hahahaha, you kill me seriously. Apple invented the touch keyboard xDDDD,  and the Homescreeeeeeen ;D       and copy and paste xDDDD. Oh gawd, you are hilarious.. So, back to Windows 95&#8230;</p>
<p>So basically software is becoming Android and hardware is becoming iPhone?<br />
WHEN WILL THE CONVERGENCE HAPPEN?</p>
<p>WHEN WILL THE CONVERGENCE HAPPEN?</p>
<p>and will we call it Goople or Aggle?</p>
<p>i will totally buy that iphone with android!!</p>
<p>What are you trying to say?!</p>
<p>If you read thr post he kept talking about in every iteration where android did something to fix where it was lagging compared to ios. Read the post.</p>
<p>actually that is starting to become true,  additions since Android arrived</p>
<p>support for Folders<br />
multitasking<br />
pull down notifications<br />
OTA updates <br />
improved (though very limited) user customization</p>
<p>I can go on and with the talk of a larger screen, next thing you know iPhones will support widgets.</p>
<p>the iPhone is really starting to look more like Android rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>none of the things you have listed was google invention, you can&#8217;t be serious</p>
<p>&#8220;iPhone is really starting to look more like Android&#8221; does not equate to &#8220;Google invented this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well that &#8216;look&#8217; that you mention isn&#8217;t represented in the OP&#8217;s list except pull down notifications which originally appeared on the Pre. Folders on ICS look more like iOS than it did previous versions of Android. Multitasking also looks completely different.</p>
<p>The G1 came out well before the Pre.  That&#8217;s the amazing thing about Android &#8212; it has technology to go forward in time and steal future ideas from everyone.</p>
<p>The Pre also didn&#8217;t use pull down notifications.</p>
<p>Poisonpatch is just an idiot&#8230; so is formul&#8230;</p>
<p>The post implies the ideas came from the android while most if not all of them are standard features of almost every single OS.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;re ok at implying that iOS was the place where all those things that Android took on originated&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yes, I do not see a person who doesn&#8217;t know his computing history /s</p>
<p>Can you name another smartphone OS that had an Android like notification shade system?</p>
<p>The article itself says in regards to OTA updates &#8220;Android&#8217;s ability to roll out updates over the air and make them nearly effortless for users to install. At the time, that was a big deal, and it was something that no other major smartphone platform was doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when iOS and other platforms add these. Standard features.</p>
<p>but according to you&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;compare this to ripping off every single mutlitouch gesture introduced in first iOS (iPhone OS) … homescreens, touch keyboard, copy&amp;paste and pretty much everything that defines touch based operating system&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t describe it as anything but pure stupidity.</p>
<p>You say the ones taken from Android(or elsewhere) are standard, but you state that Android copied the touch keyboard,and copy and paste and the HOMESCREENS   from IOS. yeaaaaaah, because these are obviously not standard&#8230;</p>
<p>You guys need to get your eyes checked. They look nothing like each other. At least stock looks nothing like each other.</p>
<p>They implement some common features and ideas, but they don&#8217;t look like each other at all.</p>
<p>Agreed, the two os&#8217;s look vastly different from each other still.  And just naming a couple of features that one os got from the other (it went both ways people) is not a convincing argument.</p>
<p>ok no more android vs iOS ranting from me &#8211; i was talking about the physical appearance of the phones as there is really almost nothing from the OS visible on the picture I&#8217;m refering to :/ you can pretty much put an iPhone as the final phone design to finish the line</p>
<p>Looking at my Nexus One, Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus &#8211; I really have to disagree.</p>
<p>Considering the Galaxy Nexus (the last in line in that photo) has already eclipsed the iPhone in more ways than one&#8230; No. Not at all.</p>
<p>Weren&#8217;t you that pro-Apple troll from Engadget who repeatedly got banned? You made a new account here to do exactly the same thing?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about how the phone looks you moron, read the whole comment before replying. From this standpoint the Nexus has nothing to offer over iPhone. It just looks more like an iPhone than its predecessors in the picture.</p>
<p>Well seeing as your software argument got hammered into the ground lets pick up on hardware. Explain to me how the nexus s or the galaxy nexus in any way resemble the iphone. I dare you</p>
<p>Actually,  the first mobile OS to have a grid of apps with dedicated buttons for Home, E-mail, etc. at the bottom was&#8230;Palm OS. Not WebOS, Palm OS, the original. Everything since has been a reiteration of that look. It&#8217;s a good layout and no worse for having been used before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never for get my Sony Clié TH-55&#8230; sigh.</p>
<p>Dude, you too! The Clie was AMAZING!</p>
<p>I mean, that was like the future, man! I felt like Captain Kirk using that thing!</p>
<p>You know, I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure of that.</p>
<p>Apple Newton, Psion/EPOC, and who knows what else organizers, PDAs, phones and stuff was out there before 1996, and those guys were based off organizer ideas in the 80s. What Palm did was finally make a PDA work well enough for mass market uptake. They were really the first to have the right formula. Though I bet the Psion guys may disagree with that.</p>
<p>Can all of you people take a minute and re-read what he said? The guy didn&#8217;t say anything about the OS, he was talking specifically about the phone itself.</p>
<p>Now whether or not you agree with <i>that</i> is a whole &#8217;nother issue, but stop spouting off about widgets, grids, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, like in the removed thread, give Apple its due. iPhone 2007 basically blew up the cell phone market and showed what future phones would look like. It was a real live operating device, not some vision in a video.</p>
<p>But the fact that Apple did it doesn&#8217;t grant them exclusive use of a slate device with a directly manipulated UI. As soon as they revealed it, and it worked as advertised, competitors were going to introduce similar devices. It took Android about year to get there, but get there they did. There&#8217;s no shame in doing that. It&#8217;s a necessary function of competition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like making the first two-door coupe and saying no one else can ever make that type of car, everyone else is left with trucks and sedans. It&#8217;s a backwards way of looking at innovation/competition, and unfortunately it <em>seems</em> to be Apple&#8217;s thoughts, especially regarding the tablet market.</p>
<p>Yeah, the lawsuits from Apple are in very poor taste. Conversely, what Samsung did is in pretty poor taste as well. It is the way of business though, and lawsuits are negotiations between companies in a different form.</p>
<p>Agree, both ways. Samsung probably didn&#8217;t have to be as similar, while Apple doesn&#8217;t need to try and eradicate them from the market</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget&#8230; Apple is suing Samsung for patent, trademark and trade-dress infringement&#8230; not necessarily &#8220;copying&#8221;</p>
<p>what do you think trade dress infringement means?</p>
<p>Android reminds me more of Windows 6.5 then anything</p>
<p>You must never have used WinMo.  As a former WinMo user I can&#8217;t imagine anything more inaccurate.</p>
<p>or else maybe he&#8217;s only ever used HTC Sense on WinMo and on Android, in which case they look pretty similar.</p>
<p>But if he&#8217;s hanging around on tech blogs, he should know the difference</p>
<p>I was unfortunate enough to use a couple of WinMo phones and I have to agree &#8211; Android TOTALLY reminds me of the old school WinMo interface.</p>
<p>other than the touch friendly menus, what&#8217;s so different? especially when you look at devices like the original HD running 6.5, there isn&#8217;t really that much of a different between the LOOK of something like a hd2 and a evo 4g, or a i900 omnia and a galaxy s running touch whiz&#8230;look em up</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because of Sense, not WinMo</p>
<p>Google is the new Microsoft.</p>
<p>Who cares which company stole an idea or designed it first? I&#8217;ll buy whichever product is best, even if half of it rips off another company.</p>
<p>iPhone and Android look more and more alike as time passes.  Whatever you think about innovation and intellectual property, I think it&#8217;s only fair to say that when Apple introduced the iPhone in January of 2007, it was a big step forward for the cell phone industry.  Cell phone UI&#8217;s before that were shit, by comparison.  As this article mentions, the first Android with a touchscreen and soft keyboard appeared a year and a half later.  A friend of mine said, at the iPhone intro, that he felt he was seeing a phone from 5 years in the future.  Of course now it is 5 years in the future and the playing field is much more level!</p>
<p>Why are you even here?  If you can say that with a straight face your opinion is worthless..  What operating system have you ever used in your life that didn&#8217;t consist of icons on a screen?</p>
<p><em>i&#8217;m [sic] sorry guys, but I&#8217;m a troll.</em></p>
<p>Thats all I got from this comment.</p>
<p>This is really a high quality piece, this is why The Verge is my main blog these days. My only qualm  is that you forgot Froyo enabled the use of Flash and that was a big factor in its release at the time.</p>
<p>This high quality piece is exactly why The Verge is not a blog at all. :-)</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not a blog then what is it?</p>
<p>A lifestyle.</p>
<p>A tech website. A magazine that skipped the paper and went directly electronic. Whatever it is, The Verge is some of the best reading you&#8217;ll find anywhere in the world today. These guys are doing an awesome job.</p>
<p>lol.</p>
<p>Wait until they give some Android device a less-than-stellar review&#8230; than all you fanboys praising this will be cursing the Verge out.</p>
<p>Wait, let me rephrase that&#8230; a fluff article about the history of Android is applauged by Android fans? YOU DON&#8217;T SAY?!</p>
<p>(My opinion/comment applicable to ALL products btw and has nothing to do with how many Android or iOS devices I own)</p>
<p>Very well done, you guys really are taking content to the next level, I can&#8217;t get enough! Keep it comin!</p>
<p>Really?  So, all a website has to do to &#8216;raise it to the next level&#8217; is write a timeline about a product?  How low is your benchmark level set to begin with?</p>
<p>Perfectionist: &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t the Galaxy Nexus be a lot bigger in the picture?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, technically &#8212; I had to resize a lot of stuff in that top shot to get the words to line up (they&#8217;re all real screen shots off emulators). I think of it as an art piece more than an accurate one :)</p>
<p>Not gunna lie, the headline picture looks awesome.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity&#8230; why is there a &#8220;downloading&#8221; notification in G1, Magic, Droid and Gnex&#8217;s notification tray?</p>
<p>#easteregg?!</p>
<p>I miss that wallpaper. Should I change it back for nostalgic reasons?</p>
<p>Still, its a deceiving picture. Clearly not intentionally though. On hindsight, it would be easier to recalculate the dpi and size differences and render a different wallpaper for each.. MATH to the rescue!</p>
<p>I see, it does look really great!</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call every version you list &#8220;major&#8221;, compared to MS windows for example, but I agree, this is impressive. Nice article, again.</p>
<p>I love this article because of all the words and big pictures.<br />
Brilliant stuff Verge.</p>
<p>I have difficulty imagining an article with no words or pictures. If you could locate such an article I fear it would be exhaustively remote. : )</p>
<p>@zpower</p>
<p>For your leading graphic, can you scale each phone so that they are the right size relative to each other?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t really, see above: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2585779/android-history#84908261" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/7/2585779/android-history#84908261</a></p>
<p>Also, that took me like three and a half hours, after which I wanted to die. Not doing it again!</p>
<p>lol i just asked him to do it again.</p>
<p>:,-(</p>
<p>you are <em>totally </em> doing this again&#8230;</p>
<p>i&#8217;m surprised no one has volunteered to just do it for you, then email it to the verge. i&#8217;ve seen some of the creations the readers make on this site, and they&#8217;re a bit wild at times <img src="http://topolskyfans.net/J.jpg" /></p>
<p>Great article, this must have taken a lot of effort to write, so thanks! Do more like this :D</p>
<p>Great article that points out how far Android has come in a short time. The Verge is really pushing the envelope which is impressive!</p>
<p>Is that a Verge Android App logo on the Galaxy Nexus? ;)</p>
<p>probaby but its not an app in the traditional sense.  One of the great little tricks on Android is you can bookmark a webpage and then manage your bookmarks by adding them on one of your homescreens and their app icon appears.</p>
<p>Android is alot of fun.</p>
<p>IOS does it too, can&#8217;t wait for when it&#8217;s a porper app!</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t&#8230; but I don&#8217;t think it would be unreasonable that there will someday be a Verge app for Android. :)</p>
<p>Could we get a release date on that??</p>
<p>when it&#8217;s done</p>
<p>After Instagram for Android comes out, but before all the manufacturers get ICS on all the phones they promised (which is pretty much never).</p>
<p>Amazing stuff :)</p>
<ul>
	<li>Phone images not to scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also guys roll over the images of the home screens if you haven&#8217;t, they change!</p>
<p>Nice touch Chris!</p>
<p>This changes everything.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>i really liked that, but it&#8217;s also kinda touch for people that are reading the site on mobie devices since there&#8217;s no way to do a hover gesture on a smartphone =(</p>
<p>this is one of my favorite articles as of yet, its great to see the visual change of android and finally the galaxy nexus is google&#8217;s way to show they care more about the design</p>
<p>How awesome would it be to have this for every mobile OS? =D And then, put that in a extremely awesome database, where we can make awesome comparisons! That would be really awesome&#8230; did I mention awesome?</p>
<p>A comparison about how it changed? Well, WP7 just came out, Blackberry has been pretty stagnant. WebOS had one iteration and is dead. And Apple has had miniscule changes (minus the drop down menu) to its UI. Android is really the only one that lends itself to this.</p>
<p>iOS has made hundreds of changes with each release. They re visually subtle, but significant and powerful changes.</p>
<p>Of course they have, but not large visual overhauls. which is what led to such a compelling piece. You could certainly write an article outlining when certain features and tweaks were added, it just wouldn&#8217;t have the journalistic effect of something like this, where the UI has been consistently updated and lends itself to a nice <em>visual</em> history.</p>
<p>I should have been clearer in my post, but I was implying the visual changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they have, but not large visual overhauls. which is what led to such a compelling piece&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds like you can&#8217;t remember what iOS 1.0 (then known as iPhone OS) looked like. It had a 2 dimensional dock and a black background. No linen, anywhere! It was brutal.</p>
<p>And it still kicked the shit out of everyone else in the industry, and put a few of them out of business for good.</p>
<p>Well for WP7, Windows Mobile is connected to it so there could be one for Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget about the JIT support in Dalvik that came in Froyo, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s one of the biggest features for 2.2. It drastically increased the speed of the platform.</p>
<p><a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/05/dalvik-jit.html" target="_blank">http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/05/dalvik-jit.html</a></p>
<p><strong>sniffles</strong> I still miss my G1. If there was a way to change out the guts in one with a speedier processor and more memory I would still have it. Sure I&#8217;ve gotten used to touchscreen typing, although nothing beat the physical keyboard of the G1. I was a typing fiend on that.</p>
<p>I feel exactly the same. I have kinda gotten used to virtual keyboards (SwiftkeyX is the best virtual keyboard experience I have seen), but I still find myself cursing at the virtual keys. <br />
My next phone is going to have a physical keyboard, not upgrading until there is a decent phone I like with one, even if I need to wait for years X-D</p>
<p>Well, T-Mo has the MyTouch 4G Slide which is a pretty great phone with a real keyboard.  Wish it was a 4&quot; screen like my Galaxy S (or even better 4.3&quot; qHD or 4.5&quot; 720p), but phone makers seem determined to never make my perfect phone.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>great</strong> feature, and ore reason why Verge is quickly becoming the only tech site I regard highly.</p>
<p>I will say that the visual history of Android devices just makes me miss my G1 more and more.  Hardware call/end buttons, trackball, and a wondrous 5-row keyboard are all things I dearly miss from modern Android phones.</p>
<p>awesome post!</p>
<p>How the heck do you do a history of Android and not include the  addition of the JIT compiler in 2.2?!?! That to date may be the single most important improvement made.</p>
<p>Good point! Especially since all Android apps run in a java runtime instead of as native machine code, the JIT compiler was a massive improvement that was easily noticeable (of course, I forgot about it, too, until you mentioned it).</p>
<p>A little remark, not all the apps run in a java runtime, there is the Android NDK to write apps in C/C++</p>
<p>Also flash support in 2.2 was a major selling point</p>
<p>JIT is far more important, IMO.</p>
<p>I agree but I feel both should have been mentioned.</p>
<p>This bought a tear to my eye. Bravo!!</p>
<p>A very interesting read Chris, thank you.</p>
<p>Been on the Android train since 1.5 and it&#8217;s been great watching it evolve. Looking forward tosee what else is bought to the platform in future.</p>
<p>Nice piece Chris! It&#8217;s interesting to see how android has progressed, and how far it&#8217;s come.<br />
By the way, that&#8217;s a nice little verge icon on the Galaxy Nexus, when are we getting a Verge app?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not finished reading this yet but a pretty great retrospective so far.</p>
<p>As a former webOS supporter, I think if there was such a retrospective for webOS I&#8217;d cry. So many interesting ideas squandered first by Palm and then HP.</p>
<p>A great read!</p>
<p>Great article! Good reference material.</p>
<p>I think it would be useful to include some of the available pre-launch information, the Android company before Google bought it, and how the 4-buttons and trackball came from an long-ago era where Android was meant to compete with Blackberry (then the only truly popular smartphone platform in the US).</p>
<p>I know iPhone fans bring that stuff up to insult Android, but I&#8217;m an Android fan and I&#8217;d like to see some of that info collected in a good, dispassionate article like this.</p>
<p>Here are two pictures:<br />
<img src="http://d2o7bfz2il9cb7.cloudfront.net/main-qimg-4e33ce3cab7d71d087f69b9b961c4c62" /><br />
You will notice they had the dock at the bottom of the screen, which has been there from the start.<br />
<img src="http://d2o7bfz2il9cb7.cloudfront.net/main-qimg-3ff56b963075e98a5738460d51c5660a" /><br />
The company was bought by Google in 2005, and hardware limitations in the CPU/GPU and LCD touch screens were limiting  factors in the earliest iterations.  people mention these as competitors to blackberry, but I was felt Palm Treos were more closely related.<br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Treo650-Sprint.png/300px-Treo650-Sprint.png" /></p>
<p>Great comparison!  I had a friend who went straight from her Treo to a G2 Android slider.  Only thing she lost in the upgrade was compatibility with her school&#8217;s legacy grading software.</p>
<p>From a Treo to a G2?  There is some serious longevity in that relationship.  She is definitely committed to the cause.  Whatever that cause is I have no idea., but bravo to her none the less.!!!</p>
<p>Compatibility with the grading software was a really big deal.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget there is some mysterious video floating around that purportedly shows a slate-type phone protoype prior to the iPhone.</p>
<p>Indeed&#8230;. this is an interesting article regarding the early (pre-G1) days of Android:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/25264/Did_Android_Really_Look_Like_BlackBerry_Before_the_iPhone_" target="_blank">http://www.osnews.com/story/25264/Did_Android_Really_Look_Like_BlackBerry_Before_the_iPhone_</a></p>
<p>The article is incorrect. Here&#8217;s the money quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, my memory isn&#8217;t playing tricks on me. We&#8217;re talking November 12 2007, and Google released the fist SDK for Android. Other than the keyboard-driven BlackBerry-esque style, the SDK also supported touch screens just fine. And, just as I remembered, Google showed off a reference design with a full touch screen (and, by the looks of it, it&#8217;s capacitive) &#8211; looking suspiciously similar to the HTC Dream, the first Android device &#8211; including gestures and flicks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>November 12, 2007? As everyone knows, except for the OSNews author, Apple revealed iPhone 2007 on January 9, 2007 and shipped the device on June 29, 2007. They shipped the device in June 2007! The HTC Dream and its badge engineered T-Mobile G1 didn&#8217;t ship until October of 2008.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s 16 months after the iPhone 2007 shipped and 22 months after it was announced. And 18-24 months is your typical design cycle for a phone. Not only that, it took another 6 months before the HTC Magic shipped which was finally a phone that fit the iPhone mold: a slate style device with a soft-QWERTY, made possible by Android 1.1.</p>
<p>There may be evidence that Google had a iPhone-esque phone before iPhone 2007 appeared, but the OSNews article doesn&#8217;t present any.</p>
<p>Give Apple its props.</p>
<p>The &#8220;hardware limitations&#8221; logic is truly a terrible excuse.  As Andrew Munn pointed out in a recent post, the entire architecture of Android was based on the Blackberry model.  Contrast this to iOS, which started development in 2003 and was built from the ground up for touch.  Google bought Android in 2005 and never once thought to redesign the OS foundation for touch before the iPhone came out?</p>
<p>I am well and truly tired of hearing excuses for Google&#8217;s copying.   Same goes for Samsung, Meizu, etc.  There are so many Android fanboys who will so rabidly defend their precious treasures in the face of all evidence.  It&#8217;s quite wearisome.  I hope the courts at least judge honestly on this issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope the courts at least judge honestly on this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The courts don&#8217;t give a monkey&#8217;s about copying, they only care about infringing.  It is quite possible to infringe without doing anything so crass as copying.  It is quite possible to copy without ever technically infringing.</p>
<p>If the courts end up ruling in Apple&#8217;s favour that won&#8217;t prove that Samsung or HTC or Google copied Apple,  if they rule against Apple that won&#8217;t prove that Android didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Yeah spoken like a true fanboy from the heart. What about the LG Prada (full touch screen)that came out a year before the first iPhone. and 3 years later the iPhone looks exactly like it.. But no apple can never copy it was google and LG and everybody but Apple that copies. Please you need to leave  apple&#8217;s RDF sometime.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t come out a year before the iPhone, it came out 3 months before the iPhone. Seems like the one in a RDF is you.</p>
<p>The LG Prada looks nothing like the iPhone both in hardware and software, and operates nothing like an iPhone, including the iPhone 4/4S.</p>
<p>The two devices are about as far apart as possible for &#8220;full touch screen&#8221; devices. The fact that someone may have originally thought of something, doesn&#8217;t grant them exclusive use of the idea. The trunk of a full touch screen handheld device goes back to the 60s, at the beginning of computing age when transistors began to truly enable such devices. They thought about this stuff all the way back then. The idea of a full touch screen device goes back even further than this.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is reason the industry moved to an iPhone type model, and not an LG Prada type model. The LG Prada was basically a touch screen version of a Symbian style candy bar device, replete with T9 text entry. T9 text entry on a touch screen device! Ugh, LG&#8217;s idea was to make a luxury or premium candy bar phone. It was essentially adorning the phone with diamonds.</p>
<p>Amen, can we please stop talking about LG, and just let them die in peace already. FFS, LG in the Smartphone game, are you kidding me?!</p>
<p>Can you show me that Apple had a working prototype of a tablet style, only touch interface dating back to 2003?  Probably not, because the technology didn&#8217;t exist that allowed for a phone to be built at that point with such tech.  The iPhone was released in July 2007, 4 years later, because that was when the technology was available to meet Apples desires.  The iPods in 2003, were not including touch screen, on their OS,  why is this ?  Because the tech didn&#8217;t exist yet.  The new iPods have them, why is this? Because they can have them.  <br />
Apple realized that people would pretty much only carry one device, and these devices were strating to appear with music players. So apple had to build the iPhone to keep from losing their iTunes , digital hub scenario they were developing.  The first designs of the iPhone most certainly had keyboards.  Whether or not they were built to prototypes, I cannot say for certain but in the end, Johnny Ives and Steve Jobs decided, intelligently so, to forgo the keyboard metaphor entirely.<br />
It is important to note that the work began first on the iPad, but the phone was considered the more important device to stall other phones from becoming the de facto portable music devices.  If iPods could have been built with touch screens in 2003, they would have been built as such by Apple instead look at the interface and what the tech allowed .  The tech wasn&#8217;t there. so it wasn&#8217;t built that way. they had small screens, with incredibly low resolutions for that exact reason. If the tech was there, and the battery life, resolutions and quality of response at affordable prices for mass consumerism Apple would have built them that way.<br />
Maybe you should compare the iPod interface and hardware to what Android was doing in 2003-2005 for a less biased view of the evolution of technology.  I am not saying the first iPhone was unoriginal or un-inventive, in my post.  The tech simply was different in 2003, than it is nearing a decade later.  Just as it was different in &#8216;93-&#8217;03.  Hardware limitations are just that.</p>
<p>For the record, your mention of iPad development happening prior to iPhone development is inaccurate. I assume it comes, as always, form that video from a D conference.</p>
<p>What Jobs said in that interview was that he was shown a working prototype of a tablet-sized multitouch display, and he inmediately saw the potential of the technology for smartphones. Let me emfasize, he never says that an actual tablet was even  considered at that time. Amazingly, some people have taken those words out of context to assume the iPad started development before the iPhone, but it isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>Had that screen prototype been only 2 inches ¿would we have to assume that the 2010 iPod Nano started development before the iPhone, too?</p>
<p>Nope, you don&#8217;t have the right record.</p>
<p>Apple started a tablet PC project called &#8220;Safari Pad&#8221; sometime in 2003 or 2004. Wired, the New York Times all have reported this. And they reported this circa 2008. Just look up &#8220;Safari Pad&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not only that, Appleinsider and other Apple rumors sites reported on the &#8220;Safari Pad&#8221; project back in 2004 as well.</p>
<p>Exactly.  The idea and concept was first for a tablet.  The biography goes into more details.  Essentially, Microsoft was hyping the &#8220;Tablet PC&#8221; like crazy back then.  One of the Microsoft engineers working on it was friends with the Jobs family, and at his 50th birthday party (with Gates in attendance), the engineer keep talking about it to Jobs, to the point it annoyed both Jobs and Gates.</p>
<p>Jobs decided &#8220;let&#8217;s show him what a tablet can really be&#8221;, and he gathered his core team to ask for a tablet without a keyboard, and without a stylus.  He wanted something to be sized to allow full typing with fingers.  In about six months, they made a very crude prototype, pulling in some multitouch work from the trackpads in the MacBooks.  (Remember, they were one of the first to introduce two finger scrolling gestures when everyone else had scroll zones).</p>
<p>The phone was another project somewhat in parallel at Apple, though the first versions did use the iPod click wheel to try and build off that.  When the tablet prototype came together, Jobs realized it might work for the phone too.  The iPod prototype kept going for a bit (Project P1), while the touch one started in parallel (P2) at that point.  Six more months, and the P1 and P2 were put to the test, with P2 winning.</p>
<p>This was early 2005, and when Apple also acquired FingerWorks to really help push their multitouch tech forward.  The rest of 2005 and 2006 were used to build the proper iPhone shown in January 2007, with the tablet project being shelved for a little bit.</p>
<p>Ahhhh. so Steve &#8220;copied&#8221; the iPad and therefore the iPhone as it was based on it, from a Microsoft demo, gotcha.</p>
<p>Well you&#8217;re a brilliant man for speculating about Palm, but you&#8217;re dead wrong. Palm was a freaking joke in 2005, and BB was kicking ass and taking names. Thats how it works. High profit margins attract competition, which then lowers industry margins. Palm wasn&#8217;t attracting anything, it was BB from the start.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with you &#8211; it would also be good to see how Android stacks up against its spiritual predecessor, the Danger Hiptop/Sidekick OS.</p>
<p>Articles like this are why I love The Verge so much. No fanboy bias, just great reporting.</p>
<p>Loved this article, although I am a rather devoted iOS user. Android was my first smartphone platform, and it&#8217;s nice to see it getting some love.</p>
<p>The layout of this article, actually most articles on the Verge  remind me of the disgraced and now discontinued News of the World website. I miss the good old days, sipping my latte on  Sunday mornings reading sting (illegal) reporting, one after an another.<br />
What i am saying is,  fantastic article Zeig. just read the ice cream sandwich part. saved it in read it later.</p>
<p>p.s: read it carefully guys, this is legend of android which you will be elucidating to your grandchildren in the years to come.</p>
<p>yup, we all miss news of the world. sundays will never be the same&#8230;.  :(</p>
<p>This article is bloody brilliant!</p>
<p>I hopped on at 1.5 and haven&#8217;t looked back, love ICS and my Galaxy Nexus. Imagine what Android will be like in five years time :O</p>
<p>added to ReadItLater, this is gonna take a while</p>
<p>Great I like how each one kept the same background. Was well thought out. Showed the changes. A great article. Now I&#8217;m waiting on the one for IOS aha.</p>
<p>Awesome Article Chris ;-)</p>
<p>This pullquote:</p>
<blockquote>Google chose to work directly with HTC to make its own flagship device — a phone that would showcase pure Android 2.2 without any modifications </blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t match the actual text it relates to (which talks about 2.1.  The pullquote is also positioned next to the 2.2 section.</p>
<p>WHOOPS. Fixing, thanks for the catch!</p>
<p>No problem, sir.  Awesome article :)</p>
<p>The BEST ARTICLE ever. +100. Thanks for the read.</p>
<p>Really impressive job Chris!</p>
<p>Reading this brought back some good (and bad) memories. Though I ultimately feel really proud having been there from the very beginning with the G1 and v1 of Android. And I&#8217;ve experience every step until now. It&#8217;s really amazing just how different Android is now compared to when it began. And I can&#8217;t even imagine where Google will possibly take it next.</p>
<p>Awesome article! Can we get a &#8220;Jump to&#8221; menu on the left side like there is with reviews?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a technical limitation on the site right now that prevents us from doing that, but we&#8217;re working on it for a future release!</p>
<p>Great work chris&#8230;.this was a fantastic read!</p>
<p>wow. great post. great article and a nice way of presenting the history of android</p>
<p>Fantastic read, really enjoyed it.<br />
Not only have you written a terrific piece, Chris, you have also renewed my pathological distaste for TouchWiz. Seeing the homescreen for the G1 reminded me of the G1 booklet (actual height and width) that I carried in my pocket next to my N95 so that I could get a feel for how easy it was to play with the touchscreen. They wouldn&#8217;t let me have a G1 (new customers only) so I didn&#8217;t get to play with Android until 2.1.<br />
The other reminder is just how good the Nexus One looks to me &#8211; I would happily see that bodywork all the time, just filled with different screens and processors.</p>
<p>When my old boss came into work with his newly purchased N.One, and he let me give it a try, I wanted to knock him out with a thunderous slap, and run out the store with it.</p>
<p>OMG I love The Verge. This was an amazing article. It really shows how Google is keeping up w/ their Android development.</p>
<p>Great article!</p>
<p>Wonderful read. Great post Chris!</p>
<p>Amazing piece. I love the Verge!</p>
<p>All this in 3 years time! I can&#8217;t imagine what Android will become 5 years from now.</p>
<p>Very interesting, comprehensive writeup.  Great illustrations, too!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty surprising how little the stock android has changed. I can&#8217;t believe this platform is so popular since it seems like the least intuitive, but it&#8217;s been very well marketed at the stores for some reason.</p>
<p>I would also like to know when the introduced features became usable.</p>
<p>You must be kidding right? Do you honestly think it has changed so little? I would say this is the mobile phone OS which as evolved more rapidly, while innovating at the same time. <br />
WP is also changing but it&#8217;s too soon to tell. <br />
With iOS you would have to look at the wallpaper for telling if its &lt; 3.0 or &gt;= 3.0, and then only subtle visual changes (additions: folders, copy-paste, notifications), but version 5.0 looks still pretty much identical to 1.0.</p>
<p>As to usability, I guess that&#8217;s an opinion. My mother finds iOS more simple to use, even if she quickly encounters limitations that don&#8217;t exist in other phone OS; my sister feels much more comfortable with Androids and Blackberries. Both of them are &#8220;casual&#8221;.</p>
<p>Can we get a visual history of iOS please?</p>
<p>lol, the homescreen hasn&#8217;t really changed much =P</p>
<p>What, pray tell, has changed on the home screen?  The background?</p>
<p>iOS 1.x: your basic single page homescreen with what 12 applications?</p>
<p>iOS 2.x: 7 home screens with horizontal swipes and the dots for which homescreen you&#8217;re on, 3rd party apps, Webpage as an app-icon on the homescreen. Jiggly mode (long press on an icon) for app ordering and removal.</p>
<p>iOS 3.x: 9 home screens. swipe right from 1st homescreen for search. Voice controls with long press of home button. Double press and triple press had options to go camera, 1st homescreen page, search, etc. Some of the double tap stuff may have been in iOS 2.&#215;. Dock background change?</p>
<p>iOS 4.x: Wallpaper. Multitasking tray on double tap. Swipe right to get audio control, background audio app, orientation lock, swipe right twice for volume. App folders</p>
<p>iOS 5.x: Swipe down for notification center. 4 &amp; 5 finger gestures on iPad (pinch for homescreen, swipe left for last used app, swipe up for multitasking tray).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s some of it. There&#8217;s a bunch of accessibility stuff that the tech press never talks about with VoiceOver, 2 and 3 finger operations, custom vibrations, big text mode, inverse color mode, etc. For vision and hearing impaired, iOS appears to be much better than AndroidOS.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jiggly mode&#8221; and add webpage to homescreen were added in 1.1.3, not 2.0. The App Store itself was added in 2.0.<br />
There are many other things that changed between versions &#8211; but you&#8217;re absolutely right about the awesome accessibility in iOS.</p>
<p>buy the Steve Jobs book .LOL</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like you could say much.</p>
<p>1) iOS has learned &#8220;wallpapers&#8221; !!</p>
<p>2) iOS has learned &#8220;folders&#8221; !</p>
<p>3) iOS has learned &#8220;copy and paste&#8221; !</p>
<p>4) iOS has learned &#8220;notifications&#8221; !</p>
<p>&#8230; and that&#8217;s it, right?</p>
<p>Well you could always have a visual history of iOS instead of Android. It&#8217;s sort of the same thing.</p>
<p>Being a visual history, what visual improvements have there been over IOS&#8217;s lifetime? IOS came out of the gate looking good. The problem was, it&#8217;s looked virtually exactly the same since then while its competition has moved in leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>Compare an iPhone 1 homescreen to the iPhone 4S. I doubt you&#8217;d be able to write 1000 words on that.</p>
<p>A visual history of iOS would really have to cover the years of development before we ever saw it.   Apple would need to open the kimono and show us all the tiny steps that led up to the launch of the iPhone.  Unfortunately there&#8217;s probably too much valuable information in there for them to do that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much true.<br />
Android went through versions 1 to 4 publicly from &#8217;07 till now years.<br />
iOS came out in &#8217;07 with an OS equivalent to ICS quality, and has made small bug and usability tweaks since.</p>
<p>Interesting point. I actually have access to the iPhone prototype software, which features a pre-SpringBoard SpringBoard. I believe the software is from around 8-10 months before the iPhone was announced in January, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>I have an original iPhone that I used to run the prototype software on, but the operating system became corrupt and it is very difficult to get the prototype software to run on an iPhone which has a more modern OS version. I should really get around to reinstalling it, though, and posting about it online.</p>
<p>Just look at the latest Android phones.  They all pretty much copy Apple anyways.</p>
<p>Yes, the Galaxy Nexus, One X and crappy looking SIII look a lot like the iPhone&#8230; /s</p>
<p>Oh now I see it&#8230; They all have screens, bezels, buttons, headphone jack. How did I not see this before?</p>
<p>Chris, great article! I couldn&#8217;t stop reading. And so, I noticed several inaccuracies:<br />
1) FroYo was released on 20 May 2010, and GingerBread on 6 December 2010. Six and a half months just can&#8217;t qualify as &#8220;nearly a year after the launch of FroYo&#8221;<br />
2) You say that GingerBread brought &#8220;support for front-facing camera.&#8221; Let me remind you that HTC EVO (the first phone with FFC in US) launched in June 2010 with Eclair, 2.1, and had front-facing camera support with included Qik app, and, briefly, Skype video through Fring app. HTC may have put some magic to enable FFC on Eclair, but CyanogenMod 6 (based on FroYo) supported videochat long before GingerBread.<br />
3) One potentially major feature of GingerBread that you left out is support for VOIP calls, for example using SIP.</p>
<p>Thanks for the notes! As for the HTC-specific modifications, yeah, I left a few of those out — they also had multitouch gestures working before Android officially supported it. Tried to concentrate on &#8220;stock&#8221; Android for this particular piece. I also couldn&#8217;t cover every single feature that was added from version to version (I was already over 6K words!) and made the tough decision to leave SIP support out&#8230; I feel like Google Voice and Skype are more relevant non-traditional voice calling options for most users, and the SIP integration is kind of underused.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll definitely update the part about the gap from Froyo to Gingerbread. Thanks!</p>
<p>I agree that SIP support may have been huge, but it did not catch on, so it may deserve to be left out.<br />
But I can&#8217;t agree that front-facing camera support was brought by GB. Granted, there were no &#8220;stock&#8221; Android device with FFC until Nexus S. But CyanogenMod is very very close to &#8220;stock&#8221; Android. Also, as you say, screen resolution independence was enabled in Donut, but the first device to take advantage of it was Motorola Droid with Eclair. It does not mean that screen resolution independence was brought by Eclair, does it?</p>
<p>GB is where an official SDK API for front-facing camera appeared, so this is when it is part of the Android platform.  Manufacturers may make modifications to the platform to implement new features, but these are limited because apps can&#8217;t widely use them and will generally need to be coded with manufacturer-specific APIs for each device.</p>
<p>I have been able to swipe away individual notifications for some time on Gingerbread. I thought this was a stock feature, I guess it’s a CM7 goodie.</p>
<p>@Ziegler: might want to search &#8220;unversal search&#8221; and replace with &#8220;universal search&#8221;  (excuse the nitpick)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>The rendering up- top is amazing, but why is the Galaxy Nexus the smallest? In real life I believe it is the largest&#8230;</p>
<p>so everything lines up&#8230; he answered that question a few times now</p>
<p>This article is amazing. Quality stuff!</p>
<p><strong></strong> Definitely Amazing!<strong></strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a total Apple geek, but even I&#8217;ll admit this article is extremely well-written, heavily researched, plus easy on the eyes. I&#8217;m now a 100% supporter of The Verge. Amazing job. Keep it up!</p>
<p>Apple &#8220;just works&#8221;. There&#8217;s nothing geeky about it. LOL</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, Terminal.app can be home for quite a bit of geek :)</p>
<p>I dunno about &#8220;just works&#8221;.  Depends on what you want to do.  I&#8217;ve spent quite a bit of time in the terminal mucking around to get my MBA to do what I want.</p>
<p>I like OS X because I get BSD Unix with nice hardware and great hardware drivers (no hassles with installing Ubuntu with no commercial driver support).  Having BSD Unix at the core is way easier than dealing with Cygwin or MinGW binaries in Windows, too.</p>
<p>So yeah, in some sense, the Macbook &#8220;just works&#8221; even for a Linux software jockey like me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno about "just works". Depends on what you want to do&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s the main philosophicaldifference between Android and iOS: while Android goes for &#8220;whatever you want to do, it&#8217;ll work, somehow&#8230;.eventually&#8221;, iOS is more like &#8220;either it just works right now or never will at all&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s that different, really.  Android gives you more options out of the box, but you can jailbreak any version of iOS and do whatever you want to it.  Same with OS X.  If it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;just work&#8221;, you can usually muck around with it until it does.</p>
<p>I cant even imagine what Android will look like in another three years<br />
Looking back, thanks to this insanely amazing piece by Chris Z, the past 3 years feel like 3 decades, not 3 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cant even imagine what Android will look like in another three years&#8221;</p>
<p>Holds up iPhone running iOS6&#8230;.</p>
<p>all those like me who did not or could not read the full article, GOOD NEWS. ReadItLater Pro is just 10 cents on the market now.</p>
<p>That was a great read.  The initial screenshots really took me back to that exciting day in December 2008 when I got my G1 at the T-Mobile store in Montgomery, Alabama, after also checking out the Blackberry Storm.</p>
<p>I lived through every one of these versions of Android, and sometimes wonder how the hell I ever used version 1 and 1.5.  I don&#8217;t recall using the browser much at all until the double-tap-to-zoom came out in Eclair.  I was super excited for the free Navigation, even on my G1.  It made that poor phone work so hard that the battery would slowly drain even while plugged in to the car charger.  I also remember the Cyanogenmod team&#8217;s early attempts at using compcache and Dalvik JIT to make the G1 fly.  I used the hell out of that phone until there was <strong>finally</strong> a decent upgrade available on T-Mobile.</p>
<p>It hurt being one of the very first early adopters and being upgrade eligible, but not having choices other than the HTC Magic, Samsung Moment (lol), or some awful slow Motorola slider.  While at the same time, Verizon was rocking the new Moto Droid.</p>
<p>I got the Galaxy S the day it was released on T-Mobile.  I was concerned about Samsung&#8217;s update history (or lack thereof), but when they open-sourced their drivers on the web site, that did it for me.  TouchWiz was an abomination on Eclair.  ADW Launcher and eventually the Bionix ROM team to the rescue.</p>
<p>Now here I am, three years later with Ice Cream Sandwich on the Galaxy S, just weeks after the open-source release, and I couldn&#8217;t be a happier Android owner.  I&#8217;ve even finally lured my wife away from her feature phone.  She&#8217;ll likely be getting a Sensation or 4G Slide (which are both nice upgrades, but I don&#8217;t want to pay full price, rather wait for a 720p phone on T-Mobile next year).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to the next three years!</p>
<p>Reading a post with more than 6k words, if not as nicely done as this one, would be a waste of time. A very good read indeed.</p>
<p>It is a good article but I don&#8217;t feel like the visuals tell enough of the story as the title implies.</p>
<p>Nice post!! good summary of how it has all quickly evolved. Keep it up!</p>
<p>awesome read</p>
<p>Wonderful Article, well articulated.. BTW, I have almost owned all of them except the first and the last (GALAXY NEXUS)&#8230; But, Android is one incredible platform that has revolutionized user experience established a new smart phone arena. Long Live Google, Long Live Android:)</p>
<p>Engadget writes an epic <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/01/android-4-0-ice-cream-sandwich-review/">review </a>of 4.0? I see your review and raise you an EPIC HISTORY OF ALL OF ANDROID!</p>
<p>As an Android user since 1.0 that was a real trip down memory lane!  It may now seem unthinkable that a platform could have been launched without such basics as video &amp; a soft keyboard but when I bought my G1 it was like a whole new world!  Sure, the camera was vastly inferior to my old Nokia N95 but having never used a smartphone/touch screen device before it was a true revelation! <br />
One thing I find funny is something that has never changed &#8211; people whinging about not having the latest version of the Android OS in their phone, because I remember the days when market comments were flooded with desperate users comments something along the lines of: &#8220;whaaaaa!  I want my Cupcake!  Where is my Cupcake?&#8221;.  Sure enough some enterprising fellow released an app called Cupcake! <a href="http://phandroid.com/2009/01/27/wtfcake-cupcake-hits-market-its-an-absolute-joke/" target="_blank">http://phandroid.com/2009/01/27/wtfcake-cupcake-hits-market-its-an-absolute-joke/</a> <br />
I think this is the modern version of that app if anybody is interested!: <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.antbs.cupcake.classiq&feature=more_from_developer#" target="_blank">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.antbs.cupcake.classiq&amp;feature=more_from_developer#</a>?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEwMiwiY29tLmFudGJzLmN1cGNha2UuY2xhc3NpcSJd</p>
<p>Which leads me to ponder &#8220;where the hell is my ice cream sandwich!?&#8221; :p</p>
<p>In the title image, thats either a huge G1, or a tiny Galaxy Nexus</p>
<p>I love this site more all the time.</p>
<p>Excellent article Chris.<br />
I couldnt make up my mind to either pick up a unlocked SGS2 WHITE unlocked or Galaxy Nexus due to a huge price tag.<br />
But in the second last podcast when u said that u had bought one was the final push for me. I recived mine today. I am still at work. Cant wait to go home and enjoy being a nexus phone owner. thanks.</p>
<p>Your missing the part where android was originally a blackberry clone.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t just appreciate a good article can you&#8230;</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t mention probably the biggest benefit of the new ICS keyboard, the multitouch shift and alt character buttons.</p>
<p>Old keyboard: Press [?123] button, type some numbers, Press [ABC} to get back to letters.</p>
<p>New Keyboard: Press and hold down [?123] button, type some numbers, release [?123] button to get back to letters.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t seen like much of a big difference but sure does feel like it speeds things up a lot.</p>
<p>Thank you so much! I didnt even know that. Im loving this phone more and more everyday.</p>
<p>I also like how you can tap the shift key to go into caps or double tap rapidly to go into all caps. No more alternating between caps and capslock with each press.</p>
<p>Its another subtle difference. In the past each time you tapped shift it would alternate between caps, and caps lock</p>
<p>Somewhere, somehow, the ability to easily upgrade over the air got lost&#8230; (at least on carrier phones)</p>
<p>I wonder who to blame??? (lol)</p>
<p>Blame people who support carrier phone :-(</p>
<p>The quality of articles published on The Verge continues to astound me. Fantastic writing, Chris. I simply cannot wait for more!</p>
<p>Fantastic overview guys! Like others, I would love to see a visual history of the iPhone. Actually, since I&#8217;ve used iOS since its inception, it would be more interesting for me to see visual histories for the other major mobile platforms that have come and gone. Windows mobile in particular; it would be a nice reality check to see why the iPhone was <em>such</em> a game changer.</p>
<p>Would be nice to see this article put somewhere special (perhaps in the Android Army forum as a sticky post or something) and updated whenever a new version of Android launches.</p>
<p>Hey Chris! Great article &#8211; I refer to you as &#8220;the other Zeigler&#8221; btw.</p>
<p>I agree with calls for visual timelines of other platforms.</p>
<p>Going further than this, an infographic that combines them all would be awesome. It would be cool to see massive parallel lists of features for all platforms, with lines connecting the same feature. That way we can easily see which features debuted on which platform, and when other platforms caught up.</p>
<p>It might also put to rest the arguments about which platform does the most innovating and which does the most catching up&#8230;</p>
<p>Am I the only one who uses double-tap zoom on websites significantly more than pinch to zoom? As in, like almost never use pinch to zoom?</p>
<p>Holy crap!!!  October 22nd is my wife&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p>great article! can&#8217;t wait to read the iOS, OS X, and Windows ones&#8230;</p>
<p>Cool! You should do this for other OSes also. Maybe even Symbian or Blackberry OS.</p>
<p>I find it amazing that Android has only started to look like a real OS and not some developer-dreamt test OS. I had no idea the Froyo and Gingerbread search magnifying glass looked so comical.</p>
<p>+1 from my Nokia N9  ;-)</p>
<p>Android 1.x definitely had a late-90s Linux look about it, and it didn&#8217;t look entirely right until Gingerbread, when they got rid of the cartoonish white status bar.</p>
<p>exellent post&#8230; steve jobs would approve.<br />
<img src="http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/9453/72854075.jpg" /></p>
<p>Pretty sure he&#8217;d aptly point out Google&#8217;s steady evolution towards an iPhone copycat.</p>
<p>Very nice even for someone that used Android for the last 2 years.  And even nicer for those jumping off the ios slow boat to the Nexus/ice cream sandwich bullet train.</p>
<p>Now we can see Chris&#8217;s multiple hours he spent in photoshop alone.  I love the beginning picture!  The article is equally amazing!  Well done, Chris.</p>
<p>Great read. Thanks for you time in doing this Chris. Great to go back and appreciate Android.</p>
<p>Very good job Chris. I will read more once I am done with finals next week this time! This is the true power of the Verge and I can&#8217;t wait to see more quality articles such as this lovely piece of Android deserts :p</p>
<p>can you guys make this for iOS? and os x / windows?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been mentioned before, but the iOS visual history would be pretty bland. On a purely aesthetic level, iOS hasn&#8217;t changed as significantly as Android or Windows Mobile ( &gt; WP7)</p>
<p>This was a really good, in-depth article. Looking forward to more of this kind of stuff. I wonder if other OSes (iOS, Windows, Mac OS, Windows Phone) will get the same treatment over time.</p>
<p>the version fragmentation of android has never really bothered me in the past.  I never found the differences between the 2.x versions to be all that major, but with ICS, it&#8217;s really starting to bum me out.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m okay that my captivate may never get Gingerbread.  But it drives me nuts to know that it will never get ICS.</p>
<p>I hope in Jellybean, Google does something to solve this problem.  It&#8217;s obvious that carriers and OEM&#8217;s aren&#8217;t going to be of much help.  After all, they need to offer a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; experience.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is even theoretically possible, but I think Google should code Jellybean in such a way that all OEM&#8217;s have to do (or can do) is provide drivers and position the rest of the OS in a way that users have complete control over updates.  Essentially, they need to find a way to make Android like Windows.</p>
<p>Samsung can&#8217;t stop me from installing Windows 8 on my Laptop, why should they be allowed to stop me from installing the next version of Android on my phone.</p>
<p>Loved reading this. I&#8217;ve been with Android since 1.5, I had the LG GW620 and it was an awful phone! Android was good but the phone was poorly designed and had hardware problems. Managed to get it exchanged for a Sony Ericsson X10 running 1.6 and eventually updated to 2.1. I then discovered Rooting and Cyanogenmod/Custom ROM&#8217;s and installed 2.2 on my X10! I&#8217;m now the owner of a Nexus S and have ICS running on it. Will be getting the next Nexus/Google device next year without a doubt!</p>
<p>Android has changed a lot in 3 years. I&#8217;ve only been a full fledged user for the past 4months and there are many things I dislike about it and really like about it. My miscellaneous thoughts:</p>
<p>-Is it me or has Android&#8217;s look seemed less friendly since 2.3? From 1.0 to about Froyo it just has a bright look to it but now it has a &#8220;darker&#8221; look (black borders, toolbars etc). I much preferred the look of the G1 era. I think the bright and friendly look, had more in common with Google&#8217;s web products like Search, Calendar, Maps etc. and the Chrome browser. The most recent app that invokes this look is the Google+ app which I really love the look and functionality of. Essentially what I&#8217;m saying is, I just wish Android looked a bit more like Google&#8217;s web products (a unified design language let&#8217;s say) and the Google+ app specifically.</p>
<p>-I wish a manufacturer would release all their phones with stock Android. I hate that I can&#8217;t recommend a phone to someone because the upgrade path is uncertain or if there would be a learning curve in going from one skinned UI to another.</p>
<p>-The OG Droid is still a cool-looking phone, wish they kept that design and just updated the internals. The Droid 4, design-wise, is a major step down and the build quality of the Droid 2-4 seemed to get plastic-ier as it has progressed. I wish more Android phones looked like the first Droid than the ovular-rectangles we get these days. Considering how many manufacturers there are, there aren&#8217;t too many interesting designs coming out, at least not here in the US. Maybe it&#8217;s a case of the grass being greener on the other side thinking, but the most interesting designs are coming out in Japan (Sharp&#8217;s AQUOS line for one) or are not really pushed by carriers/manufacturers (Sony Ericsson). Android always had potential for new/interesting/unique/beautiful industrial design but few have taken advantage of it, and it just seems that everything started to look the same after a while. We need more Droid 1&#8217;s. Is what I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p>What started as a Blackberry rip-off ended as an iPhone rip-off when Eric Schmidt was on Apple&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Sad you didn&#8217;t even include this pre-iPhone picture of what Android really was:</p>
<p><img src="http://daringfireball.net/misc/2011/08/white-android-prototype.jpg" /></p>
<p>How about the space changed and Android changed with it? Rip off is the wrong phrase.</p>
<p>Exactly, if they hadn&#8217;t adapted to the changing market, they probably would be no further along than RIM is now.</p>
<p>I was about to post the same thing. Odd how the article fails to mention  this.  Google  was lucky they  had someone on the apple board when the iphone was developed.  imagine the y would have launched with this otherwise.  As an android developer at the time  who  used the sdk, let me tell you this thing was shit and so radically different from the current android API that  when google went redesigned it to clone the iphone they did  it behind closed doors and only allowed access to certain developers under NDA.</p>
<p>Awesome write up Chris! Android for Life! :)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for that delightful read Mister Z! A very fun and insightful read indeed.  :-)</p>
<p>Wow, so many comments. The community on The Verge really grew fast. I mean they launched the site like a month ago?</p>
<p>Ever heard of Engadget?</p>
<p>Seeing its steady evolution toward the ever-unattainable, highly-evolved perfection of iOS, I think it&#8217;s time for Google to rename their OS to Neanderoid.</p>
<p>Well written and great visual aids. Even though 4.0 has come a long way since 1.0, I would still never consider owning an Android device. I&#8217;ve been an iPhone user since it&#8217;s original release and I would love to see an iOS version of this article.</p>
<p>Another fantastic article. Outstanding layout.</p>
<p>This is why I love The Verge. Quality journalism and tech news that I can rely on to accurately tell an important story or give me great morning reading material. Keep it up and I will keep coming back.</p>
<p>Very good article..I have been interested in Android since the beginning&#8230;but only converted in the past year.  Quite a stroll through the not so distant past&#8230;Thank you</p>
<p>Great Job! good read. wish you had thrown in my first android phone the htc droid eris.</p>
<p>I initially thought the hype transitioning from This Is My&#8230; to The Verge was going to disappoint. It&#8217;s abundantly clear to me now that I can delete several dozen RSS feeds and instead just follow The Verge.</p>
<p>Wonderful work Chris. This article is bookmarked for reference.</p>
<p><strong>I finally read the article and it has some big mistakes like how Eclair didn&#8217;t have multitouch but 2.0 and 2.1 were still considered Eclair and in the 3rd week of January after the Nexus One came out Google sent out an update to add multitouch to the Browser, Gallery and Maps:  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/02/nexus-one-gets-a-software-update-enables-multitouch/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/02/nexus-one-gets-a-software-update-enables-multitouch/</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Also it says that Google didn&#8217;t change the numbers of homescreens until 2.2 came out in May 2010 but that is very wrong because the Nexus One came with the change with 2.1 on January 5th, 2010. I remember all of this because I lived it.</strong></strong></p>
<p>Massive Update.. that about I can said about Android&#8230; oh&#8230; and they have massive type of gadget too.. from cheaper &#8211; expensive&#8230;.</p>
<p>Still rocking an HTC Magic. The Rogers one. PVT32A :)</p>
<p>had a G1, Mytouch, and the Nexus S. All fantastic devices.</p>
<p>This is my THIRD time reading this entire article! Sorry, couldn&#8217;t help it. Okay&#8230; I&#8217;ll stop now.  =)</p>
<p>I dont think so. Android is a story ，but not a style story ,only a doer.</p>
<p>The quick Verge jumps over the lazy dog. LOL!</p>
<p>Did anyone else notice the note with the Weather icon on the Nexus One? &#8220;Helping Grandpa get his tech on&#8221; LMFAO</p>
<p>Please do a Visual history of iOS and Windows Phone. I love to see how much these OSes have evolved.</p>
<p>iOS screens home screens will all look the same, so count on a lot of text.</p>
<blockquote>Apart from a couple tricky letters like &#8220;X,&#8221; we&#8217;d expect the trend to continue for a while.</blockquote>
<p>X is easy:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Xocolatl</strong>  &#8211;  Aztec drink made from cacao seeds and various spices  <em>-OR-</em>  where we get the word &#8220;Chocolate&#8221; from</blockquote></p>
<p>This really is an amazing piece. Good work!</p>
<p>Well, a lot has changed in three years, to say the least!</p>
<p>Sidenote: Google should have stuck with HTC as the OEM for their Nexus phones. Samsung&#8217;s build quality feels downright cheap compared to HTC&#8217;s.</p>
<p>This is my second read through and I can say I wish I would&#8217;ve had an OG Droid.  That thing was the phone that made Android what it is today.  I am pretty sure I will upgrade my Droid X to a G-Nexus in March!</p>
<p>FACT CHECK:  <blockquote>And one of Android&#8217;s defining (and oldest) features saw a thorough refresh in 4.0, too. The aging notification screen is still one of the best implementations available in a mobile platform, but ICS improves it by making individual notifications removable simply by swiping them off the screen. In older versions, your only options were to clear them all — not always the desired behavior — or to acknowledge the notification in question by pressing it, which would usually send you into an application that you may not want to be in.</blockquote><br />
This isn&#8217;t accurate, is it?  I do this all the time in Gingerbread, and IIRC, this functionality has been around for a while?  I have a friend who just noticed it on his HTC Hero (unrooted)&#8230;</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;maybe that&#8217;s built into Sense, rather than Android on my friend&#8217;s phone?  I just realized this is probably  a feature of Cyanogenmod on my own.  Just trying to help, but maybe it was hasty&#8230;</p>
<p>Chris&#8230;&#8230;.. Great Article&#8230;..Very informative&#8230;&#8230;.Very nicely laid out</p>
<p>indeed, that&#8217;s something I want to give the Verge crew kudos about, the design of your posts get equal attention as the content. Very nice.</p>
<img src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1219695/home-40-3.png" />
<p>Android needs to still clean up their icons.  Even in JB, their standard app icons are not uniform.  The Phone icon is like 3d with lighting from the upper right, while the Contact, App Drawer, and Messaging icons are more flat . Also, the Browser icon is semi 3d, but has lighting from the bottom!</p>
<p>They need to hire someone better at graphic design to make at least the standard google/android app icons uniform!</p>
<p>The whole design of ICS and JB seem so disjointed. Some of it is tron, some faded color matte texture, and some of it is stark white and orange like google now. It&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p>What a fantastic journey it has been, I personally cannot wait to see what Google and OEMs have in store for us. It certainly is an exciting time to be an android user.</p>
<p>The prototype builds of Android devices looked like a hybrid between blackberry and palm OS. And shortly after the iPhone was announced, Google showed off those prototypes and one of them had a touch interface. The prototypes were incomplete, but there were some obvious indications of widgets and notification drawers coming. When the G1 came out, it didn&#8217;t look like an iOS at all. It looked like Google finished the prototype OS, took the touchscreen version, and slapped the keyboard version&#8217;s keyboard on the back. It looked this way until Froyo, when Android actually started to look a bit more like iOS and felt modern. Then ICS eventually comes along and we have Holo. Even if Google did remove the blue highlighting, the thin lines and animations still give me a Tron-like feel, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>My G1 came with 0.9</p>
<p>Those early days using the G1 certain did foretell the many many improvements we have seen through these releases.  However, are long-time Android users on this list comfortable with ICS?  I wonder if Google has not gone just a step too far (on the smartphone, I&#8217;m saying).  Nonetheless, I&#8217;m anxious to try Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 (as I think, directionally, that&#8217;s where Google has been headed since HoneyComb).</p>
<p>Very, Very well written article and analyses of each iteration of Android. I thoroughly enjoyed reading.</p>
<p>I hope they add the ability to delete an email from the notification bar.  How many times have you had a spam alert then had to go into your mailbox and delete it?  Would be great to delete right there in the notification bar.</p>
<p>I have been with Android since 2008 and I have never had Spam in the notification bar.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he means a notification of an email in the spam folder, rather a spammy email in the inbox, he just wants to be able to delete it from there.</p>
<p>I may be mistaken, but I think they added that functionality in Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Very, very nice article. And although I wouldn&#8217;t like to miss my Galaxy Nexus anymore for any other phone, I had a lot of fun with the Nexus One and I still like the design of the Magic very much. (white HTC one, dunno what name it got in US)</p>
<p>This would be great if the top graphic were actually to scale.</p>
<p>worst. article. ever.</p>
<p>how is it possible for you to fail at trolling? &#8230; that&#8217;s messed up.</p>
<p>Flagged 10 times</p>
<p>Someone posted an iOS evolution at cNet.</p>
<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57463858-233/5-years-in-the-evolution-of-the-iphone-os/?tag=nl.e404" target="_blank">http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57463858-233/5-years-in-the-evolution-of-the-iphone-os/?tag=nl.e404</a></p>
<p>for shame&#8230;iOS looks the same generation after generation</p>
<p>it does look the same.. in a way &#8211; though some aspects have clearly changed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that Apple got a bit closer to their mark out the gate than Android did.</p>
<p>Now that (stock) Android is maturing, the visual changes are less and less radical and more incremental.. just like iOS. The evolution of Android 2.3 to 4.1 is much more subtle than the 1.x to 2.x was, for example.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that both iOS and Android are still far from perfection.. Apple needs a bit of design modernization and Google needs a bit of design consistency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’d say that Apple got a bit closer to their mark out the gate than Android did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, ya think?!</p>
<p>Yes looks the same but dont forget the features and the smoothness of the OS</p>
<p>That was a great read, and you seemed to have been working on it since December 2011!</p>
<p>This was a wonderful trip down memory lane! Absolutely made my day&#8230;. and made me miss the physical keyboard on my G1&#8230; I have never experienced a better mobile keyboard than the G1&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Love my G1 and the OG Droid is still my favorite phone I have ever owned. Miss my physical keyboard.</p>
<p>Matias responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; the status bar was inverted so it had a black background with white text.</p>
<p>This seemingly trivial change actually had a pretty big effect on the appearance of the platform — it instantly looked cleaner and more modern — but in reality, Google probably did it primarily to reduce battery drain and the effects of burn-in on AMOLED displays.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>In reality we did it to make Android look cleaner and more modern. I know, because Gingerbread was actually the first Android release I worked on&#8230; :-)<br />

It was also not a trivial piece of engineering &#8211; major kudos to the team that made it happen!</blockquote>
<p>Great article Chris ! I am loving this site more than ever. True unbiased opinions most of the time.</p>
<p>Also, I am a big apple fan after the transition from windows ! Mac OS X just rocks !! I used iphone in the past and started experimenting with android. All I have to say is Android makes my life easier and interesting.</p>
<p>If you belong to a category of people that say &#8220;Android copied iOS&#8221; &#8211; For your satisfaction &#8211; I would say, I agree but not completely. I actually think it enhanced the mobile OS and within 3 years the transformation is huge.Look at how it is today and compare it to the first generation. It just blows my mind to see the product development of Android. If you are a developer you will know how tough it is continuously evolve and release amazing features at every iteration.</p>
<p>I would also like to say iOS heavily copied Android with Notifications, Maps, Navigation, voice controlled features , ability to integrate native apps with twitter ( to an extent facebook.. there is a lot to catch up).</p>
<p>I  dont care who copied who.. all I care is who is doing it better for the end users ( to consumers ). So far, Android is doing a lot better than iOS in almost every aspect. With the introduction of Jelly Bean it sets the standards even higher. From many recent videos of Google Now and Voice Search it is a lot better than Siri. See this video for more proof <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=fHkhp6BwnGo" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=fHkhp6BwnGo</a></p>
<p>With the power of Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph you can only expect it go higher and effective.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people try to be a mouthpiece of others opinions instead of saying what exactly they believe in. For example, the screen size !! I have used different screen sizes and I believe a bigger screen is always appealing to me than a smaller one. Its personal choice instead of just blindly reiterating what someone else had said like it should fit in your pockets etc., ( btw, iphone 5 is rumored to have 4inch screen.. will you still argue the same point now? I don&#8217;t think so, unless you truly believed in it all these years)</p>
<p>I agree,  I still miss some features from apple. The smoothness and application switching speed, screen resolution etc. But if I go back to iOS, I will miss a lot more features from android, Infact, every single feature that makes my day !!</p>
<p>For now, Android is taking over and at a greater pace with more new features. &#8220;Google Now&#8221; is  now going to be the &#8220;must have feature&#8221; of the future. I dont care if apple copies it. Like I said, All I care is who implements it better !</p>
<p>very well said &#8220;djgang&#8221;<br />
mature comment.</p>
<p>All I say is eash OS preferrence is subjective and end of the day, consumer should rule and decide what he/she wants rather than a company forcing you to choose or fan boys (either side) forcing and thrusting their opinions on you.</p>
<p>life should become easier with the technology and smartphones are an imp part of daily life now.</p>
<p>android did indeed came a long way and from a developer&#8217;s perspective, that&#8217;s very satisfying !!!</p>
<p>Great article!</p>
<p>Key Lime Pie will be incredible on the new 2013 Nexus&#8230;. Cannot wait to upgrade my Galaxy Nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>Probably on a Nexus released in November 2012.</p>
<p>Just FYI, you&#8217;re bragging that you&#8217;ll be getting software updates. Just like every iPhone user in the world. Good job. Get a real one next time.</p>
<p>Insecure much?</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t even bragging.</p>
<p>What an interesting article. Absolutely loved it. Though I feel in the end the author got tired because it seems like ICS / JB part almost ended a little abruptly. I was left asking for more. Regardless, 9.0 / 10.</p>
<p>Would love to see this on iOS&#8230;. oh wait.. they all looked the same! :P</p>
<p>I hope next Nexus phone will have the same front design.</p>
<p>Damn it just change the back cover(They could use the same stuff like on the HTC One X). Quad core CPU + Better camera + 802.11ac + 4G</p>
<p>Maybe a bigger battery.</p>

<p>How did this leave off JIT compilation??!?!</p>
<p>That made Android 2.2 apps actually feel fast.</p>
<p>Sooo many changes and bunch of features,<br />
But still the OS is not smooth and lagfree.</p>
<p>Neither are iOS or windows phone, so what is your point?</p>
<p>are you posting just for the sake of whining?</p>
<p>So the new tablet strategy is&#8230; &#8217;we&#8217;re gonna focus on tablets so small, they&#8217;re just like oversized Galaxy Notes&#8217;&#8230; So now all your Android apps kinda look half decent on a small tablet!</p>
<p>And what was the sales pitch for the Nexus7 again? people should be able to read books with one hand while they eat a sandwich? WTF? Remind me again Mattias, why the hottest selling CE device ever has such a horrible design. I get it.. you&#8217;re into sandwiches. But besides that?</p>
<p>shut up.</p>
<p>The G1 seems so long ago. I remember when you could scroll through the whole Market place&#8230;</p>
<p>This article also highlights (without mentioning) what is great about the open nature of ROMs. On my Nexus One and S, I was already using resizeable widgets, 5 row docks and swipe away notifications so I already had features that came in later versions of Android.  I like Android where it is at the moment though, but I am looking forward to what the team and other developers do with it.</p>
<p>On a side note though, the old Android icons were ugly (IMO) as was the white notification bar.</p>
<p>Great article. All the nostalgia has made me feel so warm and fuzzy about my original Droid, that I&#8217;m no longer annoyed that my GS3 won&#8217;t arrive till Monday.</p>
<p>Cool article. I&#8217;ve been following Android since the announcement of the G1. I swapped phones a lot over the past few years, but Jellybean is so great that I can&#8217;t imagine using any other OS.</p>
<p>Memory freaking lane. Never had a Nexus One, but I think it&#8217;s one of the most beautiful phones of all time.</p>
<p>Cyanogenmod god bless them. They couldn&#8217;t do shit for my mytouch3g..that phone sucked balls.</p>
<p>If they update Android more recently introducing great new feauters on their Nexus devices maybe they will force OEM&#8217;s in the long term to switch to the stock Android in order to update their phones easier. We&#8217;re starting to see some problems with Jelly Bean where some manufactures didn&#8217;t even port their devices to Ice Cream Sandwich and good question is if today devices are even gonna get it&#8230;</p>

(Sorry, I couldn&#8217;t help myself)</p>
<p>Gogo AOKP get working on this asap :D</p>
<p>They need the source code, hopefully that follows suit with an official release shortly.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard the term &#8220;coding&#8221;? It&#8217;s called coding for a reason, it requires code.</p>
<p>No need to be an ass about it, instead just explain that AOKP works from AOSP and not from system dumps.</p>
<p>But this is the internet though. Everyone is better than everyone else.</p>
<p>I know I am.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m even better than him!</p>
<p>Not so fast!</p>
<p>Actually it&#8217;s called coding because it involves producing code. Often from scratch.</p>
<p>Win.</p>
<p>Now to wait a couple decades for Verizon to approve THEIR version.</p>
<p>you chose Verizon!</p>
<p>This. Why I am jumping to T-Mo with the Nexus 4 and sticking to GSM for forever and a day. This is bullshit, smh.</p>
<p>Have fun with your shitty coverage.</p>
<p>Depends on where you live.</p>
<p>Also depends on if you go places other than home and work.</p>
<p>Wifi calling, your post is moot.</p>
<p>Going places other than home and work, your post is moot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to switch. If I had know Verizon would be this bad, I never would have signed  on the dotted line.</p>
<p>Same here. Switching to contractless TMobile as soon as my contract with Verizon ends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately some of us rural users don&#8217;t <em>choose</em> Verizon. I excitedly ported my number to a Straight Talk SIM last week in preparation for ordering the Nexus 4 and dumping my Verizon GNex. After using AT&amp;T&#8217;s network in a temporary phone for two days I was all but forced to port my number back to Verizon. I watched the pre-order news go by without ordering and I&#8217;m sad about it. I&#8217;m also sad about being stuck on 4.1 after 4.2 came out yesterday for the GSM GNex. I&#8217;m thinking about moving to a major city over all of this, but continuing to <em>choose</em> Verizon seems more logical ;)</p>
<p>So you didn&#8217;t check the coverage map before you made the switched? I think that&#8217;s the most important part. Then if you&#8217;ve determined that you&#8217;ll have coverage where you live/work/places you visit, then make the switch.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T coverage is fairly acceptable in my area, I believe capacity was the issue. When callers dialed my number they often got fast busy signals, pops and hisses, a huge (20s) delay, or a combination of those things. It was really odd. I sat and tested it from my wife&#8217;s phone (which was still on Verizon) and it happened on around 2 out of 3 calls. I thought the port didn&#8217;t complete properly, but Verizon assured me everything was out of their system. I should state too that perhaps this was Straight Talk&#8217;s issue, not AT&amp;T&#8217;s, and that ST&#8217;s tech support is virtually non-existent so I did not try to fix the issue through them. One person I asked with AT&amp;T said they were experiencing the same thing lately, so I have a feeling it is a problem in their system locally. I don&#8217;t mean to draw a correlation between AT&amp;T and this problem in all areas, Verizon just seems to work better here. I got a RAZR Maxx HD and it&#8217;s actually pretty nice, but I&#8217;m still bummed about not getting a Nexus 4.</p>
<p>He assumed it was a nexus device, incorrectly, unfortunately.</p>
<p>This is why I jailbroke. And I&#8217;m never looking back.</p>
<p>*root ?</p>
<p>Indeed, root. The term jailbreak is most often associated with iOS-based devices and, to my knowledge, the two terms mean different things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not familiar with jailbreaking, but rooting just gives you access to the root user, thus the name</p>
<p>I thought jailbreaking an iOS device gave you root access too?</p>
<p>Well, yes, but the term comes from the fact that you&#8217;re breaking the device out of its jail, thus opening it up. Android is already open. They just don&#8217;t give you default access to root user because they don&#8217;t want you doing stupid shit like &#8220;rm -rf *&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hmm. what does &#8220;rm -rf *&#8221; do. O, now i <del>-</del>&#8212;-</p>
<p>You dun goofed.</p>
<p>it just makes your computer faster&#8230;. _</p>
<p>Man! First I learned something so thank you! Second I place this post along with the rub your HD with a magnet to repair it and XKCD&#8217;s campfire. I had a good laugh, thank you again!</p>
<p>Correct,<br />
Jailbreak means to leave a walled garden, on Android when you click allow apps from unknown sources you have been &#8220;jailbroken&#8221; since now you can gets app from sources other then Google</p>
<p>Root means to gain root access to the root account on a *nix system such as iOS (BSD) or Android (Linux)</p>
<p>It just happens that to jailbreak an iOS device you have to have root and thus the terms have become conflated</p>
<p>rooting and jailbreaking are not the same thing. I wish internet users would stop using them as if they are.</p>
<p>lol, root.</p>
<p>I love that word.</p>
<p><a href="http://australiandictionary.net/root" target="_blank">http://australiandictionary.net/root</a></p>
<p>I think when he says jailbreak he means that he&#8217;s sticking to iOS devices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also waiting for the source code to a see if we can get it running in my desire S. I already have the new notification bar, the camera, Google now and the keyboard soi there&#8217;s no rush.</p>
<p>Nope, I meant unlocked/rooted. I&#8217;ve got a Verizon Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.</p>
<p>And one of the main reason they&#8217;ve decided not to release this phone on Verizon. Really annoying.</p>
<p>Hey, if it means it&#8217;s relatively bug-free, so be it. In the meantime, I will continue to use the perfectly functioning 4.1.1 with an LTE connection. This hating on VZW is ridiculous. It has to go through carrier testing. This is the same for every single other OS on the market. Has it ever occurred to you that Apple takes their latest software, has it carrier tested without it being news, and then once done, says, &#8220;Here it is&#8221;? Whereas, Android is open-source. It&#8217;s made available to the public when done. Then it gets submitted to carrier testing at the same time. The carriers get it when everyone else gets it. It&#8217;s akin to how developers are now getting iOS6.1 beta to play with. Eventually, Apple will finalize it, send it to carriers. Only then will the public hear about a finalized production version of 6.1, i.e. when it&#8217;s ready for carrier roll-out.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I feel it would just be better for Google not to announce ANYTHING until the versions of Android have been carrier tested. That way, there wouldn&#8217;t be any of this crybaby stuff. Just enjoy your LTE and live your life. It&#8217;s just software. Nothing&#8217;s wrong with your Jelly Bean. Try living with an iPhone 4 that can get the latest 6.0.1 and still be gimped of features. Would you rather have that?</p>
<p>Nah, within 3 months, probably.</p>
<p>Agreed! Or Cyanogenmod; whichever comes out with the first stable/milestone build.</p>
<p>I flashed it a couple hours ago; love the interface changes to the clock &amp; camera apps! However, Apex crashes whenever I try loading it, and the dock is non-interactive with Nova Launcher. So back to AOKP JB M1 for now &#8217;til those bugs are ironed out :(</p>
<blockquote>&#8230;the dock is non-interactive with Nova Launcher&#8230;</blockquote> <p>As in you can&#8217;t use sideswipes etc, or something else?</p>
<p>As in, none of the icons in the dock respond to touches. You can&#8217;t even get into the app drawer.</p>
<p>Stock launcher works fine, of cours.e</p>
<p>Christ &#8211; that bad? Thanks for the heads up, Nova would have been one of the first things I reinstalled when I get my nexus back. (Screen being repaired)</p>
<p>The bugs have been fixed in the latest beta &#8211; <a href="http://api.viglink.com/api/click?format=go&drKey=1359&loc=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.xda-developers.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D1389071&v=1&libid=1352816443374&out=http%3A%2F%2Fteslacoilsw.com%2Ftesladirect%2Fdownload.pl%3FpackageName%3Dcom.teslacoilsw.launcher%26betaType%3Dpublic&ref=http%3A%2F%2Fnovalauncher.com%2F&title=%5BAPP%204.0%2B%5D%20Nova%20Launcher%20-%20Nov%2013%202012%20-%20xda-developers&txt=Nova%20Launcher%20Beta%20APK&jsonp=vglnk_jsonp_13528175194874" target="new">apk link</a>. Now the dock is working perfectly fine in my Galaxy Nexus running 4.2. You can get the latest beta version by going to Nova Settings &#8594; Check for updates &#8594; Click the vertical ellipsis and then choose Beta)</p>
<p>Superb, thank you.</p>
<p>My phone will probably be in the shop for a couple more days, and I expect this will be released as a formal release pretty sharpish (these guys know their market audience). If not done by the time I get my phone back though, I&#8217;ll use this method, thank you :)</p>
<p>These bugs will be fixed shortly once the Apex and Nova devs get their mitts on 4.2. :]</p>
<p>The latest Nova beta fixed the bugs. That was really fast.</p>
<p>And this is why I bought my Nexus. Software update as soon as it&#8217;s available!</p>
<p>*You could also try going into Settings&gt;Apps&gt;All&gt; and then finding Google Services Framework. If you Force Stop and then Clear Data on that, sometimes that will trigger the update into being pushed to your device.</p>

<p>This worked for me, thanks a ton.</p>
<p>OTA is one thing, but AOSP is the real deal. Until that drops, AOKP and Cyanogen can&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p>Now that native-4.2 handsets are available, I would expect the AOSP push to happen fairly soon.</p>
<p>Absolutely, in fact I&#8217;ll be surprised if it takes more than a few days &#8211; a week at the most.</p>
<p>4.2 was committed to AOSP a few hours ago.</p>
<p>AOKPs site has been under maintenence.  They had a landing page that said they were checking for viruses, and when I tried surfing there using Chrome it wouldn&#8217;t let me because it said the site contanied malware.  Never seen that issue before and I&#8217;m seriously puzzled.</p>
<p>AOKP and CM probably won&#8217;t start working with this until the source drops which I hope is soon!</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t complain because I&#8217;m not a dev, but there are quite a few CM devices out there that were waiting for CM9, and then when Jelly Bean came out all the devs jumped ship to CM10, I predict another jump to working on a CM11 alpha, meanwhile the latest stable release is still CM7.2 for many devices. Le sigh.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fair amount of devices with stable CM9&#8230; Just not the low-end low-popularity devices.</p>
<p>They actually do, they&#8217;re just not on cm&#8217;s website. You can find them in the xda subsections. Most are unofficial builds.</p>
<p>4.2 will be cm10 still i believe.</p>
<p>Yeah I&#8217;m guessing CM10.1</p>
<p>They announced on G+ that it was going to be 10.1</p>
<p>They just released stable CM10 today for &gt;30 devices, if it ever got CM9 support it got CM10 support.  There are plenty of devices that they said didn&#8217;t have the specs to support it, whether it was due to ROM, RAM, or Processor.  If it&#8217;s on CM7 it&#8217;s probably not going to CM9 and up&#8230;</p>
<p>Literally just flashed CM10.0 on my VZ GNex. Will see how it runs over the next few days to see how &#8220;stable:&#8221; it really is.</p>
<p>Check here for the official  factory images (no 4.2 here yet): <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little irritating that there are at least 4 versions of the Galaxy Nexus, not mentioning weird regional variants (my Telstra one apparently wasn&#8217;t going to get direct-from-Google updates without modification). I am hoping there&#8217;s no more than 2 versions of the Nexus 4: GSM and CDMA.</p>
<p>So far it looks like Google learnt their lesson from the Galaxy Nexus. One could even argue they went <strong>too</strong> far aka not compromising for LTE.</p>
<p>They will never sully the NEXUS name ever again. I want to slam this POS Vz Gnex trash as soon as I get my hands on my N4.</p>
<p>You mean Verizon update process is a POS?  Well unlock and rom is another option to remove the POS feeling.  While I loathe Verizon for messing with it I love my phone running a AOSP rom.</p>
<p>we shouldn&#8217;t have to. I think people forget that one reason to get a nexus was for latest updates WITHOUT unlock/rooting.</p>
<p>Clearly, I got a NEXUS for a reason. I am rooted btw, but I prefer the stablest of the stable ROMs, straight from Google.</p>
<p>So far N4 only comes in HSPA+ flavor.</p>
<p>Right. All of the Spring and Verizon GNex users were pretty much screwed for updated, and I think Google learned their lesson. They sacrificed LTE, but this way every user of the Nexus 4 will get the same &#8216;Nexus&#8217; experience that they paid for.</p>
<p>Sure. But how many HSPA+ flavours? For the Galaxy Nexus there are Takju, Yakju, Yakjuxw, Yakjuux, Yakjudv, Yakjujp, Yakjuxe, Yakjuzs, etc. Only Takju and Yakju are maintained by Google and the rest are handled by Samsung.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t really know how many variants there are of the HSPA+ Nexus 4 until people all over the world have them in their hands and can dig into them.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>There is the Play store version, and also the version that is sold at operators and retailers, which could be possibly locked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit like a russian roulette, the Nexus version you end up with. Mine was a &#8220;Yakju&#8221; variant that stubbornly refused to get the JB update, even though it was available for about a month. I flashed the Google-maintained Yakju image and never looked back&#8230; (this also changed my boot animation to Google&#8217;s colourful &#8220;X&#8221;, instead of Samsung&#8217;s).</p>
<p>I wonder if they&#8217;ll even bother with carrier versions (beyond the minor tweaks they did for a &#8220;T-Mobile branded&#8221; N4). If they weren&#8217;t willing to make separate versions for LTE, they probably won&#8217;t bother with licensing CDMA either.</p>
<p>It sucks that they are dropping support for the Nexus S though&#8230;</p>
<p>The page has been updated, there are now 4.2 images for Nexus 10, Nexus 7 (wifi &amp; 3G), Nexus 4 and the takju variant of Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p> One thing about the Nexus 4 is that it doesn&#8217;t have 4G LTE so you dont have to wait for Verizon to work out all the compatibility with their 4g network. Should see updates a lot faster on that phone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning on compiling it for toro as soon as the source and binaries drop. Contact me on <a href="https://plus.google.com/109306209515120677819/posts" target="new">Google +</a> if you&#8217;re interested</p>
<p>Why is it only for Takju galaxy nexuses at first? Why no love for yakju? I guess I could manually flash it, but that&#8217;s too much of a hassle for what will probably be an OTA very soon, but still&#8230;</p>
<p>They usually come about a day or two after Takju, so no biggie.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now rolling out for the Nexus 7 as well, according to Android Police.</p>
<p>Oscar Bluth&#8217;s one-armed man: &#8220;and that&#8217;s why you always get a Nexus&#8221;</p>

<p>Good Find,  but that isn&#8217;t the one post in this article.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll expect Sprint/Verizon versions to be coming around St. Patty&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Sprint, maybe. 2027 for dumbass verizon. Pretty sure they&#8217;ll ever turn the launcher button into a &#8217;V&quot;.</p>
<p>Sprint will probably be early December. Verizon a month or two after that. I hope to have a GSM Nexus to replace my Sprint GNex before that happens!</p>
<p>Betting odds on the Nexus S getting 4.2?</p>
<p>I really wish we had a hint about that. Though 4.2 being a tiny update and knowing the Nexus S already has JB, should be enough of an answer&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, JB runs quite smoothly on my Nexus S.  Can&#8217;t wait for 4.2.</p>
<p>It has already been announced, Nexus S won&#8217;t get the 4.2 update&#8230;</p>
<p>Battery life improvement or bust!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d update my Nexus 7, but the screen cracked in my hand while plugging in the USB changer.  Plastic piece of crap.</p>
<p>You were holding it wrong.</p>
<p>A lot of people have been holding it wrong.</p>
<p>pics or it didnt happen</p>
<p>Great news when i read this article unfortunatly but Nexus 7 still havn&#8217;t gotten the update yet so i suppose i have to wait.</p>
<p>On a similar topic, my GSM european galaxy S3 still hasnt gotten the Jelly-bean update, don&#8217;t get this, why updates have to be so slow. Thank god i bought an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>the s3 is a legacy device, it runs not android but touchwizz, it has nothing to do with jellybean and it will never receive jellybean. maybe they update touchwizz but that gives you nothing. the last &#8220;update&#8221; from pseudo ics-touchwizz to pseudo jb-touchwizz brought a new 1pixel divider-line in the app drawer, they shuffled a few options in the settings app and that was that. if you buy touchwizz, google android doesnt concern you.</p>
<p>Not sure if serious&#8230;.</p>
<p>It does run Android moron</p>
<p>@Molesarecoming&#8230;.WTF are you talking about. The S3 runs Android. TouchWiz is not the operating system. It&#8217;s just a UI/Launcher that runs onto Android.</p>
<p>you probably have to plug into Kies the horrible desktop client to get the update or go to update in the about menu to update. I  have herd that people have got it in the uk at least</p>
<p>I did and it does not give my any updates via Kies, which is the weird thing. I live in Sweden and have a european S3, many swedish websites report that they rolled out JBs in sweden like a month ago. I&#8217;m replacing the ladies Nexus S with my S3 so a wonderful device wont be to waste.</p>
<p>Did your iPhone 5 get Jelly Bean yet?</p>
<blockquote>We&#8217;ve contacted Google for comment on when the latest version of Jelly Bean will be made available to other Galaxy Nexus handsets, but it appears that you shouldn&#8217;t have too long to wait.</blockquote>
<p>What does Google consider &#8220;too long&#8221;? 4.1 took 2 months. 4.0.4 took 4 months. All on unlocked and unsubsidised HSPA+ devices, with hardware identical to that of devices with Takju and Yakju, and sold through independent third party electronics retailers so it&#8217;s no good blaming carriers.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking about yakjuxw etc. then we know exactly who to blame: Samsung.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really Google&#8217;s fault. Google hired Samsung to make a Nexus phone and decided to outsource a great number of things even post manufacturing to the OEM. Google is in charge, Google is to blame.</p>
<p>I agree that Google should never have allowed the situation in the first place.</p>
<p>I hope nothing like that happens with the new Nexuses. Judging by the fact that they refused to make a Verizon version this time, I&#8217;m cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>When Swedroid (a Swedish Android blog) asked LG about future updates (if it&#8217;s going to same with Nexus 4 as with Galaxy Nexus), they answered that &#8220;We want to test and approve the update before we release it&#8221;</p>
<p>There you go&#8230; gah.</p>

<p>I guess we will see.</p>
<p>And the NTT docomo Galaxy Nexus is still stuck at 4.0.4</p>
<p>Key lessons to be learned:</p>
<p>1) if at all possible buy unlocked from the Play Store if you like to have timely updates and zero carrier headaches.</p>
<p>2) Verizon is awful and terrible and you choose to use their service. So stop complaining.</p>
<p>These are new lessons? I thought both of these were well know facts years ago?</p>
<p>Hooray!!. thanks verge just updated manually as ota update would have taken a while yet, ( probably next week if we are lucky!). Looks good so far</p>
<p>thats on the nexus 7 by the way</p>
<p>But when will OTA updates come to the retail, non-Google Play Galaxy Nexus (including those which were flashed to yakju, which is my case)?</p>
<p>Very very soon if history is an indicator.</p>
<p>Or just flash to Takju if you&#8217;re desperate, only difference is Google Wallet&#8217;s inclusion</p>
<p>Any news on Nexus S and S 4G? How about the CDMA Galaxy Nexii?</p>
<p>gah! no update for my gnex yet. Lame, I hate waiting! Took days to get the 4.1.2 update.</p>
<p>Ahhh not getting it :(</p>
<p>I&#8217;m patient. Look how long it will take other devices to update. My Nexus 7 will update soon.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping Google will just circumvent Verizon, and release the LTE ROM right away. With the GNex Toolkit, it&#8217;s really not a problem for me to temporarily root and update. The last ROM (JB) was leaked about a month before Verizon went OTA. I&#8217;m not interested in a modded ROM, but I have no problems manually installing the official one. I&#8217;ve done that with 4.03, and 4.1.</p>
<p>You have a few notifications need tending to.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the 4.2 features, hopefully get the update in the next few days.</p>
<p>Everyone should calm down, go to this XDA thread and download a pre-rooted flashable ZIP extracted from the factory image:<br />

<p>Seriously, it&#8217;s so easy my high-school-age sister can do it.</p>
<p>Or you can wait for the OTA update.</p>
<p>Woohoo just recieved update on my Nexus 7. Didn&#8217;t do anything as well, happened right away.</p>
<p>Remember, you have to do it in the correct order to force it&#8230;. clear data / cache then stop the service.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d not recommend clearing the Google Service Framework cache, it can sometimes cause issues with the Play store and downloading applications &#8211; you get an [rpc:aec:0] error. If anyone does get this, it can be fixed by clearing the Play application cache, then removing your Google account and readding it.</p>
i can't download any apps now. gotta clear cache and remove account. pain in the ass.
<p>Wow, i might never get this on my 1st gen Note !!!</p>
<p>It worked on my Nexus 7 but not on my Play Store Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>did the steps as said three times and it didn&#8217;t work. Is it important to clear the cache before I force quit. When I went on the Google Services Framework  the cache was 0.0kb so I couldn&#8217;t clear it as there was nothing to clear. So I just didn&#8217;t clear and carried on but it didn&#8217;t work so can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Same here. Repeated the steps as recommended in update 2, but no luck. I even cleared data when clearing cache wasn&#8217;t an option. The last update went back to 1969, so something was definitely reset. But it still thinks 4.1.2 is up to date.</p>
<p>Make sure you turn off wifi while clearing and stopping framework &#8211; didn&#8217;t work for me until I followed this. Also, you have to have wifi access when checking for the  update.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t get it either, disabled wifi, went into apps/Google service framework, cache already empty so deleted data, force quit. then turn wifi back on and check, no result! :(</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t have it. Just a quick question also, the whole day I have been in an British airport so is that effecting it? Is the airport not letting me get it?</p>
<p>I just got it. I did it like this in the end:</p>
<p>1. Go to Settings &#8594; Apps &#8594; All</p>
<p>2. Find Google Services Framework.</p>
<p>3. Tap on Force Stop.</p>
<p>4. Select Clear Data.</p>
<p>5. Head back to the Nexus 7′s Settings, go to About, and check for a System Update.</p>
<p>(AKA i didnt bother with wifi, this worked on second try)</p>
<p>Tap &#8220;Clear Data&#8221; or &#8220;Clear Cache&#8221;?</p>
<p>Thanks all for your help. I got the update :-)</p>
<p>Here is exactly how you should do it (worked for me twice in a row, on my nexus 7 and my galaxy nexus):</p>
<p>1. Put your phone in Airplane mode (ON)<br />
2. Go to Settings → Apps → All<br />
2. Find Google Services Framework.<br />
3. Tap on Force Stop.<br />
4. Select Clear Data.<br />
5. Head back to the Nexus 7′s Settings, go to About, click on &#8220;System Update&#8221; and put airplane mode to (OFF)<br />
Please TheVerge, change the instruction you currently have.</p>
<p>~Tim</p>
<p>Did it twice, and it worked just fine.  Thanks.</p>
<p>Clear Data. my cache was always empty anyway!</p>
<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have left my Nexus 7 at home today&#8230;</p>
<p>Clearing the cache/force stopping worked. Thanks!</p>
<p>Just keep checking the factory image list for your phone variant. Once the list has a 4.2 version for your nexus device you should be able to do the Google Services Framework dump to pull down the latest version.</p>
<p>Available Images can be found here<br />

<p>Installed via stock recovery.  It&#8217;s pretty sweet on the Galaxy Nexus.  Lock screen changes were a bit disconcerting.  Can&#8217;t figure out how to merge the local profile &#8220;Me&#8221; contact with my gmail account contact for myself.  The News and Weather widget needs to get updated to be available on the lock screen.</p>
<p>My Nexus 7 took about 3-4 days after release before I could get the 4.1.2 OTA (tried the Framework trick many times that first day but didn&#8217;t work), but my 4.2 OTA arrived sometime last night between 7:00pm-10:00pm, I was off wifi all day and connected at 6:54, went to check for updates and it said &#8220;Last checked 6:54pm&#8221;&#8230; forced a new check, still no update&#8230; went back to it later that night around 10:06 and it had the prompt waiting for me!</p>
<p>Finally a fast update for a legacy device, makes me glad I got a Nexus 4 yesterday, Google better do the same next year.</p>
<p>I had to clear data and wifi disabling didn&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p>I did it literally 10 times but it worked on the tenth. Don&#8217;t give up!</p>
<p>I plugged it in after my 6th or so try. Plugging it in might make a difference.</p>
<p>Got the update yesterday on my Galaxy Nexus. Just clicked &#8216;Check Now&#8217;  for 4-5 times and it appeared!<br />
Initial Impressions:<br />
a) The clock widget is great with ability to add different time zones. <br />
b) PhotoSphere is Phenomenal. <br />
c) Gmail app finally resizes the HTML e-mail to the phone screen. Although you will still have to enable this setting as it is not selected by default.<br />
d) MXPlayer does not work with 4.2. Waiting for an update for this app.<br />
e) I think the default font used  in few apps like Twitter has changed. I may be wrong but it certainly feels to me and by the way it does look better while reading tweets.</p>
<p>More to follow soon&#8230;</p>
<p>I did that trick from the article when 4.1.2 came out. Not only was there still no upgrade available after it but it screwed up my account (I couldn&#8217;t install anything from Play store for example) &#8212; I had to delete it and start from scratch.</p>
<p>I finally got the 4.2 update this morning on my Galaxy Nexus. It&#8217;s a solid upgrade over 4.1; evolutionary rather than revolutionary, and I&#8217;m fine with that.  Gesture typing makes typing so much easier for me. I like it better than Swype, even. I think my typing speed has already doubled. Photo sphere&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what use I&#8217;ll find for it, but it is a really neat trick and it works fine. The camera is a lot more responsive now and I don&#8217;t have to hit the trigger button repeatedly just to get one shot anymore. So I&#8217;m liking all the improvements they made to the camera. I&#8217;m liking the new clock/stopwatch/timer as well; very handy. So far, so good&#8230;</p>
<p>Hmmm so how long until there are some working 4.2 roms out for Verizon GN&#8230; want want want want want</p>
<p>When will the jelly bean 4.2 update come for Galaxy Nexus (yakju) model ?</p>
<p>Was about to ask the same question. :/</p>
<p>Also I would really appreciate if anyone running 4.2 could let me know whether or not <strong>VIBER</strong> ( the voip app) works with it, because their tend to break after each OS update.</p>
<p>Got 4.2 for N7.  Overall pretty good but the quick settings could use work.  In portrait mode they overlap meaning you have to swipe down more than 50% on either side.  A bit annoying actually.  The other issue is they aren&#8217;t all toggles, some just link to a settings page.  Toggles would have worked better.  My 2 cents</p>
<p>Got 4.2 for my Nexus.  Liking the gesture typing.</p>
<p>Is there any difference between buying an Nexus7 with 4.2 Pre-installed and buying a Nexus 7 with 4.1 Jelly bean and getting the update via Air ?</p>
<p>Google Play store has Nexus with 4.2 Jelly Bean where as in the market we can find Nexus 7 with 4.1 Jelly bean installed.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus is the best phone ever.</p>
<p>Apple, please give me $100 to upgrade my iPhone 3G!</p>
<p>You should sell it on eBay, you&#8217;ll get more than $100.</p>
<p>You can get a 3GS for less than $100&#8230;</p>
<p>Motorola has to pay me to get this phone, how can i name a divice DROID&#8230;RAZR&#8230;MAXX HD!<br />
Maybe I can pay them for the brave!</p>
<p>Razr Maxx was their best-selling phone since the original Droid&#8230; I guess most people are more concerned with specs and battery life than goofy names.</p>
<p>no, you can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Pretty sure eBay won&#8217;t lock you in a 2 year contract.</p>
<p>I believe that in this case you get to keep the old phone.  Not a trade in.  I might be mistaken though.  Not a big deal for some but it would be a huge deal for me.</p>
<p>Even if it is a trade in, you&#8217;re likely trading in a low end phone to get the Motorola Razr M for free.</p>
<p>Why? You&#8217;re just as likely to be trading in a Maxx to get a Maxx HD.</p>
<p>With all the difficulty they are having with the Bionic and ICS, I won&#8217;t be surprised if my phone ends up being one of the rebate phones.  It would be nice to keep it as a backup and wifi device and I don&#8217;t really consider it low end.</p>
<p>To be fair the 3G was released in 2008. Phones released in 2011 are not getting Jellybean.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t released in 2011..</p>
<p>Google, please give me $100 to upgrade my <strong>T-Mobile G1</strong>! <br />
/s</p>
<p>My Nexus One wants that 100$ too. _</p>
<p>Your iPhone 3G is over four years old.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s like asking Google for $100 because you can&#8217;t upgrade a T-Mobile G1 to Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Except the G1 is actually several months younger.</p>
<p>I had a iPhone 3G back in 2009-2010. How in the world do you put up with the slowness of the CPU?</p>
<p>How kind.</p>
<p>WHat about devices that came out 2 months before ICS and yet will never receive it.</p>
<p>Yes I&#8217;m bitter,  but at least my two-year old iPhone 4 still gets updates.</p>
<p>Thunderbolt ICS was delayed. Again. Sigh.</p>
<p>HTC phone and&#8230;. it was already a year old before it was released&#8230; it was the EVO and the HD2 before it.</p>
<p>Sigh indeed.  I hate the phone so much I wish I could destroy it in front of an HTC engineer&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>You and me both.</p>
<p>I think they just committed to upgrading all 2011 phones to JB.</p>
<p>I must say that is a pretty classy thing to do.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly. That is classy.</p>
<p>handing out free units to the audience too. Google has really good at showing love.</p>
<p>More like sneaky. They&#8217;re not giving you $100 in cash. They&#8217;re giving you $100 to lock you into the Motorola family of products for another 2 years, without any promise to actually fix the problem. Savvy business move because it actually makes them look like they&#8217;re being generous.</p>
<p>Woah! That&#8217;s a pretty decent trade off.</p>
<p>No it&#8217;s not. You&#8217;re going to have to purchase a new phone off contract to get the $100&#8230;..</p>
<p>Wait, Isn&#8217;t buying off contract a good thing in America? and besides, it beats running your old phone into the ground.</p>
<p>Most of the time it has no benefit.  Most carriers do not give you any particular advantage to buying off contract as opposed to on contract.  The exception to this is T-Mobile, who reduces your monthly bill.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s disgusting that your fees are the same regardless of whether you are subsidising a phone or not.</p>
<p>Why is it &#8220;disgusting&#8221;? The fact in other countries you have to buy your phone outright is disgusting. That&#8217;s a high bar of entry, i dont know about you but i prefer a lower bar.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, most countries have two options: on contract which has a lower up front but higher monthly rates, or off contract which has a higher up front but lower monthly rates.  In the US, the monthly stays the same regardless of whether you pay more up front, making off contract hard to swallow for most people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m well aware of how phone plans work around the world, but if you look at it, it&#8217;s not necessarily better.  In the good &#8216;ole USA, many people are on family plans and can&#8217;t afford 5 or 6 smart phones @$700 a piece on t-mobile. That&#8217;s a bad deal &#8211; I think people are smarter than you think. People who buy off contract are just paying for the freedom to spend more money in the long run, like the opportunity to buy multiple full price phones within a 2-year cycle, more than someone who is in a 2-year contract would. Also, if the phone breaks within the 2 year cycle (which is likely) off-contractors are on the hook for the full price of the phone plus buying a whole new replacement phone at full price (no insurance when you BYOP).</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to buy the phone outright. You can go on a subsidized plan just like you (usually for less money too) or you can buy your phone outright, but if you do, you don&#8217;t pay the same monthly fee as if you were subsidizing like you do&#8230;because that is horrendous.</p>
<p>Who said it would have to be off contract?</p>
<p>How so? Most people pay close to $100 per MONTH on a smartphone contract with Verizon, so how does getting 1/24th of your contract cost back sound like a decent trade-off to you? It&#8217;s not even like they&#8217;re sending you a prepaid Visa card that you can go and buy groceries with or something like that, it&#8217;s a $100 discount on your next Motorola device. No thanks.</p>
<p>No, because I could get the $100 credit but I have no interest in ever being a Motorola customer again. I have had three cell phones by them. I am done with it.</p>
<p>What if Moto can run it fine in house but the carriers block it over &#8216;performance issues&#8217;?</p>
<p>good question.</p>
<p>Why would they give you $100 credit for not getting Jelly bean just so you can buy the RAZR HD&#8230; that is launching on ICS?</p>
<p>All three devices launch with Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>You should read the articles again.</p>
<p>who said ICS? they mentioned all 3 will be on JB</p>
<p>RAZR HD article:<br />
<blockquote>A Jelly Bean update should be announced soon, but for now, it&#8217;s starting with Ice Cream Sandwich.</blockquote></p>
<p>RAZR MAXX article:<br />
<blockquote>The RAXR Maxx HD will launch with Android 4.0 at first, but Motorola promises an update to Jelly Bean before the end of the year.</blockquote></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same ol&#8217; &#8220;soon&#8221; promise. I don&#8217;t doubt them, but still&#8230;</p>
<p>following the Live event and Verge posted this:<br />
<blockquote> 11:33:33 AM PDT</blockquote></p>
<p>All of these devices are running Jelly Bean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the liveblog:</p>
<p>11:33:33 AM PDT<br />
All of these devices are running Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>The demo units on-hand at the event have Jellybean. The devices that go out to the public will have 4.0.</p>
<p>I was really hoping Moto would announce a carrier agnostic unlocked device. :(</p>
<p>That can&#8217;t happen in America&#8230;</p>
<p>Sure it can.  Google aready sells one The Galaxy Nexus</p>
<p>Not platform agnostic. The verizon version is known for issues for example.</p>
<p>Sure, one model for the rest of the world, but three in America.</p>
<p>Me too. This is depressing, and a far cry from the day&#8217;s &#8220;main event.&#8221; Sorry Moto, but an announcement of three phones exclusive to a single US carrier is not exciting at all.</p>
<p>He just slapped Elop and all Lumia 800 owners</p>
<p>There is a catch .. you have to be getting one of the devices they are revealing today to be eligible for the $100 credit.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s pretty obvious and not a catch</p>
<p>just wanted to add because it wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the original posts</p>
<p>Yeah, so AT&amp;T and Sprint devices don&#8217;t qualify. Sucks for those Atrix owners.</p>
<p>This is a good move by Motorola. Acknowledge that these devices cannot be upgraded and entice them to buy latest handsets by offering them a rebate&#8230;<br />
well done&#8230;</p>
<p>i wonder if my atrix 4g will qualify. I&#8217;m not at all sold on another Moto device yet though, unlocked bootloader is a must. If it&#8217;s crappy amoled like the razr then no go at all.</p>
<p>Only if you&#8217;re willing to switch to Verizon. Unless something changes, the rebate is only available on the three phones announced today, which are all Verizon phones. Moto owners on AT&amp;T and Sprint are SOL.</p>
<p>Hey Moto, ETF is way more than $100.</p>
<p>you will still be on verizon only</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that they will upgrade my Bionic to Jelly Bean in the next 3 months while I still wait for ICS.  Jokers.  I&#8217;ll never buy Motorola again.</p>
<p>Agreed. I&#8217;m so upset at Motorola and Verizon about the Bionic&#8230;</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re seeing some influence of the acquisition on Motorola.  Quick updates, rebates, new phones launching on the latest&#8230;  Good stuff.</p>
<p>will Moto release a GSM version which is world phone like GN?</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t look like it. Seems this was more a Verizon dog and pony show than anything else.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll probably have to wait until the September 18th event with Intel for something like that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming Droid 3 owners will get this credit then since the phone came out in 2011 and won&#8217;t even be updated to ICS.</p>
<p>Droid Bionic owners. Droid 3 owners. Attention.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be receiving a $100 for the update that won&#8217;t be coming your way.</p>
<p>Will this rebate be offered to all owners of a device that can&#8217;t be upgraded to Jelly Bean or only devices that were released in 2011?  I&#8217;m still rocking the original Droid from 2009&#8230;</p>
<p>They said &#8220;devices&#8221;  did they even specify smartphones.  I still have an old razr dumbphone bouncing around somewhere, and I&#8217;m pretty sure it ain&#8217;t getting JB.  I&#8217;m sure there is fine print somewhere.  Maybe my Droid X pmp will qualify.</p>
<p>Put it in the bank, there&#8217;s no way Moto is going to upgrade my Photon 4g to JB.  But problem is I&#8217;d rather not get another Moto Device.  Oh well, i&#8217;d rather sacrifice that $100 bucks to get the phone I want (Note 2), than the only Moto JB device available on my carrier (Photon LTE)</p>
<p>I wonder if the Xoom owners outside the US are eligible for the $100.</p>
<p>How desperate are you to call on such lost creatures?</p>
<p>Before the end of the year sounds like a hard claim to accomplish. Just like the 6 weeks after ICS source code that Sanjay said last year. <br />
Some phones are just now getting ICS. Like droid 4.</p>
<p>100$ to buy a nexus.</p>
<p>I would Love to get the Droid Razer Maxx but i dont know if i can put up with the pentile green-ness for the sake of batter life, I&#8217;d like to think i could darnit</p>
<p>Damn that &#8220;released in 2011&#8221; bit. I&#8217;ve been holding out on a new phone with my Droid 1 held together with tape :/<br />
Though, I did flash Jelly Bean on it&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;(or your free dollar, in the RAZR M&#8217;s case)&#8221;</p>
<p>I will venture a guess that the 99$ price is with some contract, so this is not the real price of the phone. We have subsidies here in Europe too, but we never claim our phone&#8217;s price was the subsidised price.</p>
<p>A $100 trade-in for a device that most people are stuck in a contract with for another year or 2 just to take another gamble with them after they just abandoned their 2011 flagship devices on all but Verizon? Oh wait, it gets better, you get the rebate after buying the new device and showing them proof you purchased it. This is nothing more than gimmick. In fact, the details weren&#8217;t even ironed out until months after the announcement.</p>
<p>Let the whining begin.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a Galaxy S3+ with a stylus&#8230;</p>
<p>Pretty much. But what&#8217;s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Well, Tesio did say let the whining begin.</p>
<p>Why does that iPhone have a pen? Seems very un-Apple like.</p>
<p>Oh boy.. here we go!</p>
<p>Does any winpho7 user notice that water drop sound when you unlock the Note II is almost like the one from winpho since 2010?</p>
<p>SUE!</p>
<p>That sound would be the first thing to go if I ever bought this phone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprisingly hard to turn the Nature Bloop Experience off.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s actually a sound of a orange juice drop in a glass cup</p>
<p>so it&#8217;s not the poo going down the toilet?</p>
<p>it can&#8217;t be an iphone, it has NFC which won&#8217;t be on Apple until Sept 2013, if at all&#8230;</p>
<p>If at all&#8230;</p>
<p>iFatal</p>
<p>nice :)</p>
<p>Not even Apple thinks Samsung&#8217;s new products look anything like the iPhone. Galaxy S3 has not been sued anywhere.</p>
<p>I hope this is true. I fear it just takes a while to get these law suits rolling, and the Galaxy S3 suits wont show up for a while.</p>
<p>galaxy s3 is actually already sued, in the same case as the nexus, on docket for 2013-2014. They wanted it to be included in the last case, but the judge ruled that it was too late to enter new devices.</p>
<p>This suggests otherwise;- <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/apple-asks-court-to-ban-samsungs-galaxy-note-and-galaxy-s-iii-from-us/" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/09/apple-asks-court-to-ban-samsungs-galaxy-note-and-galaxy-s-iii-from-us/</a></p>
<p>But i suspect this is a case of give an inch and they&#8217;ll try and take a mile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure people will confuse this with the Iphone, regardless of the fact that there&#8217;s a big samsung logo on top and is 2&quot; bigger /s</p>
<p>No just those jurors who gave Apple $1,000,000,000</p>
<p>Is this the whining the OP was talking about?</p>
<p>Have iPhones always been that big?</p>
<p>Nothing. That makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>nothing. He just said the f@kin truth.</p>
<p>its stupid to have a 5.5 brick in your pocket thats the wrong bit</p>
<p>Well then good thing that purchasing one is strictly voluntary, eh?</p>
<p>Yep, this is my next&#8230;</p>
<p>The original note actually fits better in the pocket than most people thought it would. Don&#8217;t knock it until you try it.</p>
<p>Original Note is much more comfortable in my pocket than my iphone4s with mophie air case</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the problem really. It&#8217;s when it&#8217;s in your hands that it&#8217;s unwieldy.</p>
<p>Well some find a tiny 3.5 inch pebble stupid as well!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what she said.</p>
<p><img src="http://maxcdn.liewcf.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/ipad-2-pants-pocket.jpg" /></p>
<p>either you&#8217;ve got some tiny pockets, or that is one big iPhone</p>
<p>Yes, this definitely looks smart. /s</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re an artist/designer that likes to have a quick and easy virtual sketchpad app with your phone and enough surface area to really work with. This is the type of device I&#8217;ve been looking for for a long time, and ticks all the boxes of what I need in a smart phone.</p>
<p>They could&#8217;ve just announced an S-pen for the Galaxy S3&#8230;just saying</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t seem to understand how it works&#8230; just saying</p>
<p>Everything?</p>
<p>Can we get a side-by-side size comparison to the S3?</p>
<p>And the original note for that matter&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe neither of these side by side shots are in here.</p>
<p>Actually, can we get a side-by-side of the Note II and the HP Veer.  I&#8217;m not sure which one I should get.</p>
<p>If you tape 4 Veers together, you basically have a Note II, right?</p>
<p>Probably. :) I just want to see the comparison and get a kick out of it.</p>
<p>Yes in GSMArena!</p>
<p>it&#8217;s huge and looks retardedly big.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also rectangular and looks retardedly like a rectangle.</p>
<p>It has a QUAD core Exynos processor.  Note 1 had a Dual Core S3.</p>
<p>and my current phone has a single core A7, so it&#8217;s really time I get something new</p>
<p>Still rockin&#8217; a 600mhz Arm v6</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be quadcore in the US.</p>
<p>Literally nothing on Android is multi-threaded enough to use 4 cores.  Besides the GPU, the quad-core is essentially the same as a dual-core Cortex A9.</p>
<p>except for the GPU clock speed, power management, etc</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s got a plastic back&#8230;</p>
<p> vacuous complaint every time it&#8217;s mentioned</p>
<p>Unless that plastic is as bad as the Galaxy Note tab that got reviewed not too long ago.</p>
<p>Bonus points for using &#8216;vaucous&#8217; in a sentence.</p>
<p>Stupid spellcheck.</p>
<p>Negative points for spelling it wrong despite the op spelling it right.</p>
<p>50 points for Gryffindor!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go now&#8230;</p>
<p>aah&#8230; that. Yes, I agree on that&#8230;</p>
<p>I want one but don&#8217;t have one!  :(</p>
<p>then you need to buy the One(X)</p>
<p>Actually, there may be some legitimate concerns.<br />
And for me is, I&#8217;m not sure if enough space is given to operate home button &amp; keys at the bottom to operate comfortably.</p>
<p>Typo &#8220;winning&#8221;</p>
<p>About what they did to JB? TouchWiz didn&#8217;t used to bother me but that looks like balls.</p>

<p>Nah, he&#8217;s just european.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KojM6.jpg" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why I like this so much.</p>
<p>I was surprised when I flicked through the comments and no one else had done it. When I saw the original in the gallery I thought &#8220;This would look so much better with a lot more Notes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Aaaaannd saved to desktop.</p>
<p>LOL, this is hilarious.</p>
<p>This needs to be the mobile podcast artwork&#8230;for real.</p>
<p>You made my day!</p>
<p>Just reminds me that we need a Shaverphone.<br />
A phone with a built in electric shaver to keep yourself neat during phone calls.</p>
<p>I just hope they fixed the horrible &#8220;nose clipper in the ear&#8221; bug in JB&#8230;</p>
<p>the ATIV S looks much better than this&#8230; doesn&#8217;t it ?</p>
<p>Yes, and it is a completely different device &#8211; what is your point?</p>
<p>The OS has nothing to do with external design.</p>
<p>on serious note: i love Galaxy Note, i feel like galaxy note at some point will start cannibalizing Galaxy S series flagship</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Galaxy S III but with a bigger battery and .7&quot;.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the SPen! ;)</p>
<p>for a second I read iPen !!!!</p>
<p>Galaxy Note was like Galaxy S2, too. I&#8217;m not sure why people are so surprised that it looks like the S3. It&#8217;s meant to have mostly the same hardware, but with an S-pen and the S-pen specific apps, and designed for a different market.</p>
<p>I disagree. It took design cues but it was more than an SGS2 with a pen. This is just a blown up SGS3 with a stylus.</p>
<p>How is that different than the transitioned it took from SGS2 to OG Note?</p>
<p>Outside of the screen res upgrade, speed bump, wacom digitizer and bigger battery, they were identical</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already happening in Korea where Galaxy S3 sales has been somewhat disappointing and Note has been selling remarkably well. However in the USA I doubt it&#8217;ll happen. The preference by the USA customers is a bit different. Asian consumers in general always liked larger sized displays better in their PMPs.</p>
<p>on my most recent trip to/from China, there were about 20 people in the premium cabin that were Chinese nationals/asians living in China. Out of 20 people, i&#8217;d say about 3-4 had iPhones, rest all had G Note. I was really surprised.</p>
<p>With the way Samsung likely schedules its phone manufacturing , it probably won&#8217;t impact them much if does start cannibalizing.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t understand why Samsung insist with green telephone icon?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why people insists on complaining about Samsung&#8217;s green telephone icon.</p>
<p>*insist</p>
<p>They did just lose a lawsuit over that and other features&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah because the jury were totally ignorant of the fact that the phone icon has been green on phones since the Motorola m301 days if not before.</p>
<p>You obviously don&#8217;t know what the lawsuit was about do you.</p>
<p>Not because of one green icon, no.</p>
<p><img src="http://lma.co.in/images/green-phone.jpg" /></p>
<p>Aw shit, coolmoi.  You&#8217;re inviting the wrath of Koh.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s a distinctive icon&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;and other features&#8221;. I was just pointing out that Apple did try to sue them for it, so why not just choose a new color in a new version. Just my opinion though.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you are joking or being sarcastic, but they got the green telephone icon from the iphone.  I&#8217;m no apple fan at all, rather a huge Samsung fan, but it&#8217;s pretty obvious&#8230;</p>
<p>As a fan of technology in general I can inform you that the green phone icon has been around since Nokia phones going back at least to 2001</p>
<p>My very first cellphone back in 95 had a green button to initiate a call.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s historical icon is a green handset facing downward (like you are about to pick it up) at a slight angle with no backdrop or border.</p>
<p>iPhone icon is a green rounded rectangle with a white handset at an angle where it is facing upwards.</p>
<p>Android stock icon is blue rectangle with the handset in white with the phone facing downward like the old Samsung phone icon.</p>
<p>Samsung should change the icon to avoid further IP problems with Apple.  Its a valid point it has also been beat to death.  That said, nobody &#8212; and I mean nobody &#8212; is going to associate a Galaxy Note with an iPhone.  If that iPhone phone icon was not a registered trademark there would be absolutely no trade dress worries at all.  Registered trademarks need to be respected though.</p>
<p>Thats not what the android phone icon is at all. Its a blue phone with no background at the same angle that all phone icons are (roughly 45 degrees).</p>
<p>Please post the one you refer to&#8230; this is what I have seen:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.silverbeanandroid.co.uk/_/rsrc/1298102449910/icon-packs-for-development/android_gui_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>1. He&#8217;s probably referring to the icon from ICS and on.<br />
2. Samsung&#8217;s icon has traditionally been green so their icon looks like the stock android icon except it&#8217;s green.<br />
3. Samsung mostly got hit on the candy coating of Touchwiz 3, not because they had a green phone icon.<br />
4. It&#8217;s impossible to avoid IP problems with Apple. Even Google and Samsung&#8217;s best effort to avoid Apple patents, the Galaxy Nexus, got hit with a lawsuit.</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/MotorolaStarTAC.jpg/634px-MotorolaStarTAC.jpg" /><br />
The OK button on the StarTAC is even green, and you&#8217;d push that to initiate a call.</p>

Nokia in 1992</p>
<p><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-C_-soqshc7U/UD5pT9l4E_I/AAAAAAAADX8/pEQPnnbTDP0/s562/12+-+1" target="_blank">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-C_-soqshc7U/UD5pT9l4E_I/AAAAAAAADX8/pEQPnnbTDP0/s562/12+-+1</a></p>
<p>Clearly Apple&#8217;s next step is to sue Motorola and Nokia. After all, Apple has a patent on green icons, and they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Are you trying to convince people that the images above are green squares with white phones in them.  I must be missing that.</p>
<p>Woah &#8211; it&#8217;s inverted (background color on green instead of green on background color). Just to point out that there is not much innovation, here is how to get from 1992&#8217;s Nokia to Samsung&#8217;s version:<br />
1) Make it square (it&#8217;s not square here because that would be a waste of space for a physical button)<br />
2) s/black/white/g<br />
3) Swap green and white<br />
4) Touch up a bit</p>
<p>Loved the StarTAC.  It was awesome for the time and I was sad when mine accidently went swimming on the beaches of South Carolina.</p>
<p>wd for missing the point entirely!</p>
<p>Exactly. The green phone icon is property of Nokia and they should sue the fuck out of Apple, Samsung, HTC, etc. copycats</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a green square with a white phone inside it.  Still green + phone but I can&#8217;t deny that it&#8217;s not a &#8220;green phone&#8221;.</p>
<p>Galaxy Camera. I know you guys touched it.  Other sites seem to have their stories up already ;)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lue6r8Nekos" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lue6r8Nekos</a></p>
<p>Ha! It has on-screen buttons!</p>
<p>Some sites even got their videos up 45 minutes ago.</p>
<p>This is the worst product announcement ever. No suspense, nothing. We already know everything.</p>
<p>Wait until the next iPhone got announced, then.</p>
<p>You have a point :)</p>
<p>Yes &#8212; just about everything has already been leaked regarding the next iPhone.  If they pull off any big surprises I will be shocked.  So much for &#8220;doubling down on secrecy&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is assuming that everything that has been &#8220;leaked&#8221; is in fact the next iPhone.  While I find myself agreeing that it is in fact the next iPhone, there are possibilities that exist, like for example that what we know is just a purposefully leaked prototype, or maybe not a prototype, just &#8220;garbage&#8221; that Apple put out to throw everyone off.  Or it could actually be the next iPhone.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; They did have a magician with a top hat and magic wand to make things uncomfortable for everyone watching.</p>

<p>I must own this.  Verizon needs to sell this or I will need to burn something down.  Like my relationship with Verizon.</p>
<p>Why not just switch to a GSM carrier so you never have to wait?</p>
<p>Well documented in my neighborhood that Verizon&#8217;s signal kills everyone else.  Just can&#8217;t live with worse signal when I&#8217;m used to a good one.  Plus I&#8217;m still a lemming consumer using the incentivized prices for better or worse.</p>
<p>Tmo is your friend&#8230;unless youre in a rural area.</p>
<p>Or want 3G on European phones.</p>
<p>why not wait for the HTC version?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re still using the infringed icons on this.. I guess that will be changed when it comes out..</p>
<p>They can still use them in markets where Apples patent is invalid.</p>
<p>Sub-fragmentation.</p>
<p>I.e., everywhere except the US&#8230;</p>
<p>No, these icons by themselves are nothing they&#8217;d have to worry about &#8211; read coverage of the lawsuits&#8230;</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t using the infringed icons.  Because you haven&#8217;t noticed, Apples complaint in regards to the icons was that they all had a colored, square with rounded corners background.  The old icons were made to mimic/resemble the iPhone&#8217;s, without perfectly copying the iPhone.  And last I checked, they don&#8217;t do that anymore.  Research before you assume/post a dumb comment, please and thank you.</p>
<p>Looking forward to getting a ROM dump from this device and porting it to the OG Note&#8230;I suspect it will be fairly easy to do.  Original Note is still a great device and I for one think the 1280&#215;800 is a nice benefit over 1280&#215;720.</p>
<p>RB<br />
GB</p>
<p>Is an improvement over Pentile.</p>
<p>Pentile&#8217;s only really a problem if you stare intently at the screen from an inch away.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used a friends note, the screen is horrible. The new one should be a big improvement. (specifically red writing on a black background looked terrible)</p>
<p>&#8220;Dontworryjusttakeit&#8221;</p>
<p>I see what you did there, Vladof.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/5213357/samsung-galaxy-note-ii-hands-on4_1020_gallery_post.jpg" /></p>
<p>Happyvlad</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t look absolutely ridiculous holding that phone. I might have to reconsider my hate towards any phone 5+ inches&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I thought.  It actually looks reasonable.</p>
<p>My GNote 1 is perfectly reasonable for making calls&#8230;this is just stereotypes. I&#8217;ve had 1 hr-long calls and never felt bad about that. People need to stop the nonsense and realize that a bigger screen gives you so much more albait at a small loss in portability.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for large screens.  The utility of it is obvious and these devices are still pocket-able.  I just presumed that they might require a bluetooth headset to be pragmatic for actually being on a call.  After seeing the GN II, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessarily the case any more.</p>
<p>its just really tall, not really fat</p>
<p>You say that to all the girls don&#8217;t you!  ;^)</p>
<p>Why would it? It&#8217;s smaller than the cordless phones no one uses anymore.</p>
<p>Nexus Phablet, please</p>
<p>Yes please, If I ever did buy the note. I&#8217;d be scraping that touchwiz shit off the instant it was out of the box.</p>
<p>This.  As intrigued as I am with the Note II, it&#8217;s Nexus only for me.</p>
<p>I want to agree, except for one unforgivable omission: external storage.  Looked, in the video, like this has a MicroSD slot.  If so, this might finally be the one to lure me away from the iPhone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming. Though you may be annoyed to find out that HTC is making the first Nexus Phablet.</p>
<p>That is how use my current Note. Note + CM10 (Paranoid Android &#8211; DPI: 213) = Mini Nexus 7 = Nexus 5</p>
<p>Whoa, they are actually using jellybean?? I thought they would use 2.3&#8230;&#8230;.. /s</p>
<p>So basically, you&#8217;re still living in the past. Since the Galaxy S3 came with 4.0, Note II was sure to come with 4.0 as well, but it&#8217;s 4.1 instead. ^^</p>
<p>did you not see I used /s?</p>
<p>IT WAS SARCASM!!!!</p>
<p>He either didn&#8217;t get the /s, I didn&#8217;t know what it was when I first arrived or he considered making the joke at all a sign of living in the past: Referencing something too old.</p>
<blockquote>The display resolution is the same as with the original Note, 1280 &#215; 720..</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect. The original Galaxy Note came in at 1280 &#215; 800.</p>
<p>What bout the camera?</p>
<p>Looks like the PDK worked/is working.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of disappointed they still can&#8217;t get samoled +to HD resolution. Especially with that size screen. PS Vlad you wear the note 2 pretty well.</p>
<p>Titanium Grey not Mountain.</p>
<p>So is this a &#8216;Plus&#8217; screen or not? The Verge seem to think it isn&#8217;t but on Engadget&#8217;s video the Samsung guy utters the magic word&#8230;</p>
<p>The Note II seems to ditch the Pentile but it&#8217;s not quite Plus yet. (however that make sense to you)</p>
<p>For comparison, here&#8217;s a close-up shot of the SAMOLED+ on the SII:<br />
<img src="http://img1.lesnumeriques.com/article/1547/Super-AMOLED-galaxy-s2.jpg" /></p>
<p>SUPER AMOLED PL-</p>
<p><img src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1321151/xs08-29_06-37-17g1020.jpg" /></p>
<p>Despite what Vlad says, that looks like Pentile to me.</p>
<p>Well the subpixels don&#8217;t seem to look as spread as older pentile SAMOLEDS, and that&#8217;s already comparing it to a higher PPI One X with the RGP layout</p>
<p>RGB*</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite a pentile arrangement.  Pentile looks like this:<br />
<img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/gadgets/n1fig2.png" /></p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s still pentile. It&#8217;s just a different arrangement. The one you posted is RGBG pentile. The GNII seems to be a new one that is RGBB.</p>
<p>Pentile has traditionally been RGBG because the human eye detects green better than other colours.</p>
<p>I see what you mean.  Though it looks almost as if the blue pixels are the same size as the red and green ones, just turned on their sides.  That&#8217;s how I saw them at first.  I&#8217;m looking again and you might be right, it could just be pentile with twice more blue pixels instead of green.</p>
<p>In what way is it still pentile?  Is there some pentile standard I should be aware of including different arrangements all considered pentile?  I thought pentile was defined by the RGBG (or RGBW according to Wiki) arrangement.  Any other arrangement, while possibly not standard RGB, isn&#8217;t necessarily pentile.</p>
<p>I think that the new pixel arrangement is something more like B G/R, or G/R B, what ever you wanna call it&#8230; The Green pixels (or Red, depending on how you look at it) are right above the Red pixels (or Green, depending on how you look at it).  And then, on either side (left or right, I&#8217;m not sure which), is a Blue pixel Shared by the Green/Red (Red/Green) pixels.  That means that it has the exact same Sub pixel quantity as regular RGB, but in a Pentile-esque sub pixel arrangement.</p>
<p>No it is not Pentile!<br />
It has the same sub-pixel quantity than original RGB, so it is TRUE 1280&#215;720 display.</p>
<p>There are equal amounts of each color pixel, all about the same size.  I think it should be fine.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s what makes it different than pentile.</p>
<p>GO CARDS!</p>
<p>Instead of going RGBG it seems to go BR and then in the next row go BG. So it&#8217;s in between Pentile and SAMOLED+. The subpixels are also more tightly packed than in the S3.</p>
<p>From close examination of the image above, it is clear to me that there are three subpixels per pixel, just in a different arrangement than the traditional RGB stripe.  This eliminates Pentile&#8217;s cheat of only getting two out of three colors per pixel.  I hope this diagram will serve to clarify.<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/lDSh1.png" /></p>
<p>The question: is that really one blue sub-pixel for each red and green, or two separate blue sub-pixels. As long as it&#8217;s a full triad for each pixel, things should be OK because Android doesn&#8217;t do sub-pixel antialiasing.</p>
<p>However, I think your speculation that it is one pixel might be correct, due to the fact that blue is traditionally the weakest of the three colors in OLED, and they simply made it larger to give the panel longer life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Air View&#8221;? How nice&#8230; <br />
IMHO &#8220;S View&#8221; would have been more consistent with the rest of the Samsung branding&#8230;</p>
<p>SamPlay. </p>
<p>Compare it with the original Note side by side.</p>
<p>I want to see this too. I can&#8217;t really tell how big it is just from looking at it alone.</p>

<p>naah it&#8217;s Kolkata!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to use it on T-Mobile US, but I guess that&#8217;d be in Q4 2013.</p>
<p>Buy it unlocked and use a cheaper t-mobile plan.</p>
<p>I almost want this, but it&#8217;s necessarily got to use Samsung software.  And every bit of their software has been utterly disappointing.  Oh well.</p>
<p>T-Mobile better get this. Didn&#8217;t of note hit end of life last week?</p>
<p>The pen seemed very fast. I like.</p>
<p>This looks like well done job for Samsung. I&#8217;m looking forward to the review.</p>
<p>galaxy note 2. <br />
inspired by nature, designed for GIANTS!</p>
<p>Stop adding skins to Android! Why must every manufacturer ruin Android by adding all this bloated crap.</p>
<p>Meh. No thanks.</p>
<p>Yeah this device is to big&#8230;..</p>
<p>Why would you stop extending indeed.<br />
I want one in about a 20 to 26 inch size for the kitchen wall.<br />
Watch a little tv while cooking or vid chat or scribble an addition to the shopping list.<br />
Sweet.</p>
<p>They have these devices known as televisions, or tv&#8217;s for short. They come in a variety of sizes, and can mount to a wall for viewing in any location, such as, say, a kitchen.</p>
<p>Well played.</p>
<p>Yes &#8211; what is the note-taking function like on our tv?<br />
How well does skype work on it?<br />
Is the touch functionality useful or do you have to press too hard?</p>
<p>Skype works quite well on my Sony Bravia.</p>
<p>LOL&#8230; yeah I knew that one was a fly ball but was too lazy to edit it out.</p>
<p>Am I the only one that thinks that Samsung&#8217;s default skinning is ugly?</p>
<p>The first image looks like a Windows XP Phone. Blue/green/orange everywhere!</p>
<p>Nope, it&#8217;s pretty heinous. At least android makes it easy to change that, but still&#8230; should we have to?</p>
<p>Anybody else here the irritation in Vlad&#8217;s voice &quot;When will STOP extending.. &quot;. Good question Vlad. <br />
How about improve and get closer to stock Android. Stock on that machine with a few of the S-Pen attributes make this a good device. But hey, at least they know to put JellyBean on it.</p>
<p>Are you insane Vlad? This is pentile.  Do you really see three subpixels per pixel there?</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s three but a different arrangement. Red and green stacked on top of each other with a tall thin blue completing the total pixel.</p>
<p>=|<br />
=|</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The blue subpixels are shared. There aren&#8217;t three subpixels per pixel there. It is pentile. Period.</p>
<p>Shared with what? This is the layout;<br />
RB<br />
GB</p>
<p>Nothing is staggered, that&#8217;s consistent across the whole screen. If it starts with R on one side of the screen and ends with B on the other then we are dealing with RGB, nothing says they have to be in a line if all subpixels are accounted for.</p>
<p>Every single pixel must have three subpixels which have the exact same size. This is not the case here.</p>
<blockquote> If it starts with R on one side of the screen and ends with B on the other then we are dealing with RGB,</blockquote>
<p>No RGB subpixel arrangement means RGBRGBRGB</p>
<p>If it isn&#8217;t sharing subpixels then it&#8217;s not pentile. Given, this isn&#8217;t RGB either but it&#8217;s somewhere in between.</p>
<p>It IS sharing pixels.</p>
<p>This is simply pentile with the blue pixels doubled instead of the green ones.</p>
<p>Not exactly. The arrangement makes it so that there&#8217;s one blue long one for every one red and one green that&#8217;s smaller. It sort of has a pentile layout yet, at the same time, there are an equal amount of blue, red, and green units.<br />
So imagine the blue is one long strip and it you can treat this as one RGB like unit created using a pseudo pentil like structure..<br />
BR<br />
BG</p>
<p>Yes exactly.</p>
<p>Just compare it to a Galaxy Nexus or Galaxy S3 pentile array. Exact same matrix. Only difference is that the narrow vertical lines are now blue instead of green.</p>
<p>Except it&#8217;s not the same.<br />
<img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/gadgets/n1fig2.png" /></p>
<p>In the above pentile each blue and red subpixel is the same height as each green subpixel. The Note II arrangement each blue is the same height as both a red and green pixel &#8211; and all three make almost a perfect square.<br />

<p>isnt the old note 1280*800?</p>
<p>It is and this is the only thing I don&#8217;t understand about this design&#8230;why change the aspect ratio and therefore have to lower the res&#8230;after all this GNote is all about the screen. I will definitely going to stick with my GNote 1 but waiting for something similar from Nokia with WP in an year or two.</p>
<p>This thing is somewhere between Pentile and SAMOLED+. That compensates for the small drop in pixel density.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my question: Did the replace Google Now with a shittier, nature-themed version called S Now?</p>
<p>I ask this out of genuine concern as someone with a month old S3, for which I have one by one disabled every piece of S Junk that it came with in favor of stuff that actually works well. Looking forward to JB, but apprehensively.</p>
<p>video showed a glimpse of regular Google Now</p>
<p>is the GSIII jellybean leaks the google now app wasn&#8217;t modified by samsung.</p>
<p>I noticed the UI is 4x icons across instead of the original 5&#215;. Which is good, cos there aren&#8217;t enough 5x widgets for the original Note.</p>
<p>I guess going down to 720px across has something to do with it too. Definitely getting this on day 1.</p>
<p>Vlad, do you still think &#8220;one size fits none&#8221; ?</p>
<p>from the video &#8220;why would you stop expanding?&#8221;. Looking forward to the Galaxy Tab 15.1, and Note 15.1 at CES lol</p>
<p>People need to stop complaining about the size, as with the first Note it wasn&#8217;t designed for everyone.</p>
<p>Not a fan, and TouchWiz is horrible.</p>
<p>Then don&#8217;t comment.  It isn&#8217;t hard.  No one cares about your opinion, and you just wasted your own time for no reason.  Find a good hobby.  And not one that entails commenting for no purpose.</p>
<p>still ugly as hell, but i wonder if its exynos 5 (aka a15 quad core) or still with a9 quad core like current galaxy s3</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the original Galaxy Note was 1280&#215;800, not 1280&#215;720</p>
<p>i would buy it&#8230;if it has stock android xD</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why its an Android there is a ROM for that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to buy this either way but just wondering the ROM you talk about i&#8217;m assuming comes from XDA or CM or something like that but do you know if those will be 100% functional with hardware acceleration and take full use of the phones features like s-pen and such?<br />
I&#8217;m really wondering that since i will buy this and also prefer stock Android. Either way this is a dreamy phone. Want in now now now</p>
<p>Everything is software based they will surely make sure s-pen features work, the developers at XDA are amazing.</p>
<p>If you use a ROM wouldn&#8217;t you lose all the pen optimized software though?</p>
<p>ROM would more than likely have the s-pen features implemented into it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now waiting for the Galaxy Note III.</p>
<p>All new design. No copy/paste from another Galaxy line up <strong>read: GS IV&#8230; <br />
5.5&quot; Ultra Thin Bezel, Super Amoled Plus.<br />
1280&#215;800</strong> Higher resolution welcome. <br />
2.4 GB ram.<br />
Quad or 1.8 ghz Dual. Not a deal breaker.<br />
<strong>Most important feature: 4000mah battery. No excuses please!</strong><br />
Samsung, please look at the Razer Maxx, it packs a 3100 mah batt, has a smaller screen not to mention less power-hungry specs and you guys essentially give the Note II which has a larger higher-res-battery-sucking-display with more powerful innards than a T-Rex A MEASLY 3100 mah battery?!!! What!!!<br />
I want a dam phone that can last a day of heavy use is that too hard to ask? Good grief! I&#8217;m hugely disappointed. The idiots in charge of the specs should be fired and flung into hades. Not. Happy. At. All.</p>
<p>If the next one is higher res it&#8217;ll be 1920&#215;1080 &#8211; 16&#215;9 is the ratio on the phones with on-screen buttons usually.</p>
<p>If you want man-sized phone, get the Note II.<br />
If you want a good handful, get the S III. <br />
If you want a girly phone, get the iPhone.,</p>
<p>shut up and take my money, i take 2 please :)</p>
<p>This is going to be my next phone/tablet, i got 4S but damn this is so nice for surfing and productivity. Love the bigger battery, 2Gig ram, SD card. <br />
Bye bye apple this round goes to Samsung.</p>
<p>Be sure you can cope with Samsung&#8217;s chintz (or be prepared to modify). Apple&#8217;s fake leather has nothing on the worst excesses of Touchwiz.</p>
<p>Every time I see the original Note in a store I actually have to restrain myself from laughing.  It&#8217;s just so stupidly large IMO.  There is no way I would want something that large to carry around everywhere.  Heck, I think the whole supergiant phone thing is dumb.  4-4.3 is the sweet spot for me (with 4 being about perfect).  Of course, there should be choices, but it&#8217;s annoying that almost all the top end Android phones are now enormous.  Hopefully there will be more of a smattering of 4-4.2 inch devices that are also very high end coming in the next year.</p>
<p>I had the HTC Advantage X7500. Carried that thing around for 3 years. Now that thing was big.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.nl/imgres?um=1&hl=en&sa=N&biw=2560&bih=1315&tbm=isch&tbnid=RvxVjIsTXOPFgM:&imgrefurl=http://mobile.softpedia.com/phonePictures/1920&imgurl=http://i1-mobile.softpedia-static.com/images/phones/1920_6.jpg&w=564&h=457&ei=6YI-UK_RG-a10QXEtoHoDA&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=514&vpy=423&dur=2757&hovh=202&hovw=249&tx=193&ty=71&sig=111086129293798695121&page=1&tbnh=130&tbnw=160&start=0&ndsp=117&ved=1t:429,r:36,s:0,i:200"><img src="http://i1-mobile.softpedia-static.com/images/phones/1920_6.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Wait, my Kindle&#8217;s got a 6&#8217;&#8217; screen. This thing is almost as big as my eBook reader? Woah. That is one big phone.</p>
<p>I bet everyone will agree that since iphone 4 came out no other phone could match the &#8216;Wow&#8217; factor that iphone 4 &amp; 4s has.It&#8217;s tough to beat Apple..it&#8217;s all about the secret recipe of software &amp; hardware..Just increaing screen size or adding a stylus is not going to help it Sammy..!!</p>
<p>I completely disagree, never start with "everyone". As an artist, I’ve been waiting for a phone with both a pen, and one with good enough pressure sensitivity (1024!), for me to use it as a viable, portable, digital drawing tool. There is nothing at all else like it on the market. At all. I don’t have anything against iphone, their phones are lovely, but nothing will beat the s-pen on the Note 2 for me right now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s gonna be cool seeing a QUAD core Exynos processor smartphone available on US carriers.  I do think the phone is too big though.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that the US version will get the quad-core exynos.  I am hoping that we will be rewarded with a quad-core qualcomm S4 pro since there should be more supply of the s4pro in Q4 2012.</p>
<p>Really ugly and plasticy imo</p>
<p>Fact: At school, the only phones most everyone knows are the iphone (no surprise there) and the galaxy note.</p>
<p>Are there any measurements out there? I want to make a cardboard mockup and test it in my hand and against my face. I&#8217;ve been debating on what to buy if the new iPhone doesn&#8217;t blow my mind (i4 user) and it seems like I&#8217;m pretty much going to be choosing out of what is presented at IFA this year. Also, is HTC scheduled to release something at this show? Love the One X so far (my favourite in the stack up that I&#8217;m doing) but hopefully they&#8217;ll release something better.</p>
<p>Man, a year ago there was a lot of hate and mocking from tech journalists about the OG Note. Not so much now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so willing to sign a two contract for this baby :D</p>
<p>I wish they&#8217;d kept a 16:10 aspect ratio.  A rubber on the end of the pen would have been nice as well.</p>
<p>Well, not much to complain about here&#8230; When the Samsung US Director of Marketing says &#8216;We&#8217; what he really means is &#8216;They&#8217;.. because all this stuff was done by the Samsung Korea HQ&#8230; And when he tries to call Galaxy S and Galaxy Note different families of devices, they&#8217;re not really that different at all. One has a pen and some pen-related software, that&#8217;s it. And frankly, they have yet to show us why, in 2012, we want a freakin&#8217; stylus anyway.</p>
<p>And lastly, as always with anything related to the Note,  you have to point out that that thing as a phone is a ridiculous form factor. It&#8217;s just an unwieldy device to you, which is why you don&#8217;t see anyone holding the Note up to the side of their heads in any of these Verge videos or even the Samsung commercials: you look like a twat making a phonecall with the Note. If this product ever needed to exist, and so far, we don&#8217;t know that it did, it should have been a 7-10&quot; tablet, not an oversized phone.</p>
<p>I think one would look like a twat holding a tiny-girly phone against one&#8217;s face. The Note is too manly for you we get it. Move along now.</p>
<p>They are different families of devices. the Note devices have an active digitizer made by Wacom for the S Pen alongside the usual capacitive digitizer for finger touches. The active digitizer can detect pen pressure up to 256 levels.</p>
<p>Looking at that picture of Vlad with the device to his head, I&#8217;d say it doesn&#8217;t look that ridiculous.</p>
<p>Besides, I noticed that a smartphone has cut down a lot on my actual phone conversations.</p>
<p>They are significantly different.<br />
The Note sold well, so clearly some people do want a stylus.</p>
<p>As for how it looks when you hold it to your head?  That is just your opinion.  Why are you trying to tell me what I think, or anyone else thinks anyway.  That&#8217;s stupid and rude.</p>
<p>Its nice but its just really a big phone. It gets hard to hold for some people as a regular phone . Also if you arent in to drawing then its probably not the phone for you</p>
<p>Why no LTE?</p>
<p>US version will have LTE .</p>
<p>There is a European LTE version of the Note II. It is shown at the Vodafone booth. I played around with it,</p>
<p>Since this is the Galaxy S3 with a bigger screen and 4.1, does that mean that maybe, just maybe, because the OSes are very similar, the S3 really will be getting a standard 4.1 update soon?</p>
<p>YES, THEY ALREADY ANNOUNCED THIS</p>
<p>Sorry for the Caps lock*</p>
<p>You&#8217;re forgiven.</p>
<p>Lower resolution + larger screen? Is lowering the DPI considered innovation now?</p>
<p>Anyway, but, is it just me or Vlad looks thinner than before now? <img src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/5213357/samsung-galaxy-note-ii-hands-on4_1020_gallery_post.jpg" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s surprising to me is that the GNote 2 doesn&#8217;t look abnormal being held up to the head like most people make it out to be.</p>
<p>looks great&#8230;<br />

<p>The GT-N7000 was one of the best phones I have ever owned! I love the GS3 which I own now. What a perfect mix! I will own one! What ever happened to using the 5.5&quot; LG 1080p screen in the note? Well maybe next year.</p>
<p>By the way, here&#8217;s a better picture of the GNote 2 display:</p>
<p><img src="http://bestboyz.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/1208292155_2-640x480.jpg" /></p>
<p>I think that, assuming this isn&#8217;t a damn good Photoshop, confirms that the not RGB but not quite Pentile sub pixel arrangement has 3 sub pixels/pixel, instead of the normal pentile shared subpixels.  (RGBG, or as was, and might still be thought, RBGB.)</p>
<p>It could be just me, but it kinda seems like with the Galaxy Note II&#8217;s not RGB, but not quite PenTile either, 5.5&quot; display, that Samsung is gearing up to perfect an HD Super AMOLED Plus display&#8230;  And if history is worth anything, I&#8217;m guessing it will be on the S4.</p>
<p>As for the European LTE version. Vodafone is showing it at their booth. I played around with it.</p>
<p>As an iPhone user, I think that looks pretty slick but a little big. Maybe when the S4 comes out it&#8217;s time for a change&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been saying Nokia should make this kind of offer on lumias.</p>
<p>Nice move google-ola!</p>
<p>You mean like they did when the Lumia first released?<br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/10/2939848/nokia-confirms-lumia-900-data-problem-offering-100-credits-and" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/10/2939848/nokia-confirms-lumia-900-data-problem-offering-100-credits-and</a></p>
<p>no he means that the first Lumias don&#8217;t get an upgrade to WP8 although they were introduced just weeks before wp8 was presented</p>
<p>What I meant was Nokia already gave out $100 to the first few 900 adopters, why do it again but to ~7 million Lumia owners?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t even bother to read the comment you replied to.</p>
<p>In the Verge there are times when people usually don&#8217;t reply to the exact same person, but to the thread of replies either for not making more of a mess or to make a general follow-up of the discussion itself, or any other reason they have even if they just didn&#8217;t notice who they replied.<br />
The Verge comment system wasn&#8217;t exactly designed to have a good organization of large comment threads</p>
<p>Nokia wont be doing anything like this. I asked them at the NYC event and they told me to talk to AT&amp;T about any incentives to get a 920 if you bought a 900. When I asked why couldnt Nokia or Microsoft do something, they didnt have an answer for me.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s disappointing.  Then again, perhaps the person you spoke with is not the final word, authorized or knowledgeable on what&#8217;s planned.<br />
I guess we&#8217;ll have the answer in a month or two&#8230;</p>
<p>They guy I spoke to was VP of something. I get to read his job title fully because the id card around his neck swung around to show his pic in the WP Me tile. If anybody was at the NYC event, the guy I am talking about was at the coffee shop part by the stairs to go to the 5th floor a.k.a. the roof.</p>
<p>*I didnt get.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Nokia has the money to burn to make this kind of offer.   They are already running way low on cash.</p>
<p>Where does it say razr and razr maxx aren&#8217;t eligible? It just says</p>
<p>Leave us your email address and product information, and <strong>we&#8217;ll let you know when a Jelly Bean upgrade is available for your phone.</strong> If we don&#8217;t upgrade you, we&#8217;ll send you instructions on how to trade in your phone for a select new Motorola smartphone and get $100 back on your purchase. Please complete the form below.</p>
<p>The list includes phones that will be upgraded.</p>
<p>I was about to rage out after i read the article because i saw Atrix HD and quiton q which were just released 2 months ago on the list.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s been a busy week for this site but you guys should read the page before posting this article. I don&#8217;t see anywhere that shows a list of phones that won&#8217;t be upgraded.</p>
<p>Agreed. 2 or 3 issues just today.</p>
<p>Also hoping I get $100 since I have a Droid Pro (yup!) that I&#8217;m sitting on. Just like my old iPod nano, sometimes having gadgets collect dust rather than sell for a pittance on ebay is a money maker.</p>
<p>The Droid Pro didn&#8217;t come out in 2011.</p>
<p>You sure it doesn&#8217;t mean eligible to spend the $100<strong> on?</strong></p>
<p>Hey all,<br />
You&#8217;re right. We&#8217;re updating the story to properly reflect the situation. My apologies for the oversight.</p>
<p>How is $100 going to help if you bought your device in 2011 at a subsidized price? $100 isn&#8217;t going to help you very far towards off contract pricing considering you wouldn&#8217;t get an upgrade till 2013 at the earliest.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll help Motorola and Verizon make more money and/or lock you into your contract longer if you terminate your contract, and sign a new one to use the credit.</p>
<p>ok, don&#8217;t take it. i&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re fine with that too.</p>
<p>The fact that you have an option to reject an offer doesn&#8217;t mean that the offer is good.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been burned by Motorola not giving you an upgrade path the logical choice would be to look elsewhere for your next phone.</p>
<p>That being said, I applaud Motorola for effectively admitting that loads of 2011 owners are being totally skanked right now.</p>
<p>It might help someone like me who still has an unlimited plan on Verizon and will have to get their next phone unsubsidized, to stay on my current contract and not get switched over to Share Everything.</p>
<p>Too bad it&#8217;s towards another Motorola phone.  Never buying from them again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now (for the first time in years) considering buying a motorola device again, but I&#8217;ll have a look at how the updates go from now on before I&#8217;ll get one</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get this attitude. Companies in this field change yearly.</p>
<p>Some do, some don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The ones that don&#8217;t achieve better customer retention. Dare I say, it, Apple is a prime example of this.</p>
<p>Agreed. Say what you will about Apple but they don&#8217;t generally cut off updates to last year&#8217;s model. Meanwhile my Droid 3 was made practically obsolete moments after I bought it, and at a year old gets nothing. No thanks Motorola, not going to buy something from you that will never get whatever Key Lime Pie or whatever Android is next.</p>
<p>Where is the list?</p>
<p>Wait, I&#8217;m confused. Isn&#8217;t the RAZR Maxx not being eligible a good thing? That means it&#8217;ll get JB?</p>
<p>I think a much shorter list would be, what, if anything, IS getting a Jelly Bean update from Motorola.</p>
<p>Wait this is pretty weak if it&#8217;s a trade in program. I have sold all my old Droids for at least $200 on eBay&#8230;.</p>
<p>Wow &#8211; you&#8217;re right.</p>
<p>Here I was thinking that this was a generous offer but having checked their website, this is indeed a TRADE-IN scheme. And as you point out, most phones released in 2011 are still sellable for at least $100.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>1 &#8211; Motorola skanks you by making your recently purchased phone obsolete<br />
2 &#8211; Motorola offers to pay you below-market value for your obsolete phone, in return for you buying another phone off them so they can skank you some more.</p>
<p>HA!</p>
<p>So is this just for US customers?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Wish Samsung would offer something like this for the Droid Charge, which is apparently going to stay stuck on gingerbread.</p>
<p>Finally, my years of finely curated location and search history pays off!</p>

<p>the official jelly bean dance</p>
<p>so basically this is bing local scout, which windows phone 7 had 2 years ago and the biased android fan bots wrote off because it was microsoft. interesting how evryones excited over an old concept that windows phone users have enjoyed since day 1.</p>
<p>I was curious so I looked it up because I hadn&#8217;t heard of it. I think you&#8217;re making this comparison a bit of a stretch. It looks like Local Scout just finds things close to you under different categories, like attractions to see or restaurants to eat at.</p>
<p>Certainly, all the things that Google Now is doing aren&#8217;t really new. We&#8217;ve seen all these features before in various places. The big push here seems to be that they want Google Now to learn how to better give you the information you need. To learn from your behavior or past searches and provide you with helpful information it thinks you will find of use. It&#8217;s a great idea. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see how good it actually is.</p>
<p>Sounds like Local Scout is actually more closely related to Google Local, an app that appears when you install Google Maps. And both local apps are just business listing type apps. Not terribly related to search.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the story behing this epic gif?</p>
<p><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/crazy-frog-brothers" target="_blank">http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/crazy-frog-brothers</a></p>
<p>Gotta love Google Search by Image. 2 secs&#8230;done!</p>
<p>This looks awesome</p>
<p>This &#8220;more useful information&#8221; will probably end up being sponsored trash. Search is getting less and less helpful from Google and much, much more biased. As an admitted Google fanboy, I&#8217;m crushed.</p>
<p>Really? I always seem to find exactly what I need&#8230;</p>
<p>My experience is completely the opposite of yours. Google is getting better and better at guessing what I want and am searching for that they almost know before I know what I want. Scary sometimes.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>^ That. Google is starting to finish my search terms for me.</p>
<p>SPYW notwithstanding, I see no evidence of this personally.</p>
<p>This is so sick.</p>
<p>Thank you Matias Duarte and thank God i have a Galaxy Nexus!!!</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ve gotten the headline a bit wrong as it&#8217;s not search. You don&#8217;t search in Google Now. Infact I thought the whole point of it was that it&#8217;s relevant content pushed to you based on stuff it knows about you from other apps.</p>
<p>Do you not see the search bar at the top of the Now screen?</p>
<p>Correct. It&#8217;s Enhanced search.</p>
<p>This looks awesome.</p>
<p>Apple needs to step up their game with the next iPhone and the hidden iOS 6 functions because this version of andorid and whatever new nexus phone comes out is going to be a serious contender for my next, and I never thought I would feel that way about android.  Especially how it keeps making iOS look old and dated with every update.</p>
<p>FYI: The current Nexus phone is still the Galaxy Nexus. The new device is the Nexus 7 tablet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a crazy month for mobile news in terms of WWDC, then Surface and WP8 and now Google I/O and the JB features.</p>
<p>And being as objective as i can possibly be, out all the mobile announcements it seems like apple brought the least to the table. I think they&#8217;re #1 highlight a shift away from google maps to their own was incredibly noteworthy. But it kinda makes the whole announcement as a whole look underwhelming considering their replacement is in many ways inferior to what it is replacing.</p>
<p>Businesses will pay to secretly be embedded into those cards. Yay, new ad space!</p>
<p>What would you expect from an advertising company?</p>
<p>and i dont care. Google has the least intrusive ads on the net.  Facebook is 100 times worse</p>
<p>facebook ads are not even noticable.</p>
<p>google isnt intrusive? try going to google.com with a browser other than chrome, and see what kind of BS ads you get on that homepage.</p>
<p>Well then I guess it shouldn&#8217;t be a problem with ads, considering people will be using Google now on their &#8216;Google Phones&#8217;</p>
<p>Why would I do that when Chrome also happens to be the best browser out there at the moment?</p>
<p>Facebook ads sure as hell aren&#8217;t noticeable for me &#8211; it&#8217;s one of the few sites I run adblock for!</p>

<p>It seems Google&#8217;s announcement is already outdated by Ford, Microsoft, and Nokia!</p>
<p>Yes, because I can take my car with me everywhere I go!</p>
<p>Just bring explosives.</p>
<p>I think this is how basically Google Glass is going to work, Google Now cards will pop as you are walking around&#8230;.</p>
<p>Sounds just like CueUp / Greplin.</p>
<p>I knew it! We shouldn&#8217;t trust what Andy Rubin says publicly. On October 2011, this is what he had to say about intelligent assistants:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that your phone should be an assistant,&#8221; <br />
and<br />
&#8220;Your phone is a tool for communicating. You shouldn&#8217;t be communicating with the phone; you should be communicating with somebody on the other side of the phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am so glad they are all liars (or just ignorant, or whatever), because Google Now looks sooo sweet =D</p>
<p>I generally take announcements like that with a grain of salt&#8212;he had to say SOMETHING in response to Siri and since he didn&#8217;t really have anything code-wise to directly compete or outclass it, he had to shun it. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Google Now coding began around that time.</p>
<p>Like it. Location-based services finally are starting to work for its users profit, not just for fun.</p>
<p>Does anybody know how Android&#8217;s 1.3 million activations per day break down by version?</p>
<p>No straightforward of knowing (unless you&#8217;re Google), though someone may be able to estimate reasonable numbers by isolating Google&#8217;s public total activation statements and then working off the delta of active device version counts between those.</p>
<p>Considering that the 1.2% is almost entirely Nexus 7, that&#8217;s pretty impressive. I bet it will sell 8 million for just the wifi version.</p>
<p>Those of us with Galaxy Nexuseses have Jelly Bean as well.</p>
<p>5.76m total Jelly Bean Devices</p>
<p>you mean the real galaxy nexus.</p>
<p>Yes. The unlocked Galaxy Nexus bought <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa" target="new">directly from Google</a>. I&#8217;m on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Or the very easy to load an AOSP-based ROM Verizon &#8220;nexus.&#8221; That&#8217;s me and I&#8217;m quite happy to combine Jelly Bean and LET :-)</p>
<p>&#8230;LTE, that is. Edit button&#8230;</p>
<p>For a second there, I was worried I had missed the invention of the Light-Emitting-Transistor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on Verizon. Nope.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? 3 million galaxy nexus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on Verizon and my Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy S3 are both on Jelly Bean.   Just because your carrier sucks, doesn&#8217;t mean you need to be left behind.</p>
<p>Galaxy nexi*</p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just embarrassing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Are you seriously asking or just trolling? Because that means only about 20% of Android users are on last year&#8217;s version. Compared against ther types of OS upgrades (not just phones) is very slow, to the point of being shameful. Going from 0.8 to 1.2 percent with the latest version my be &#8220;huge&#8221; from a growth standpoint but it&#8217;s still effectively nothing. Android is still plagued by the fact that updates are hamstrung by carriers and OEMs, even this long after Goole&#8217;s made repeated promises that it would get faster. Even if it is faster, it&#8217;s still not fast enough.</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t answer the question.</p>
<p>The sad thing is the number of people still on froyo. That shows how many people either keep their phone for more than 2 years or deny carrier updates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing primarily for Google.  They spend zillions of dollars updating and improving Android and only 20% of the devices can even use the improvements.  That gotta make life incredibly frustrating for them and developers because they can&#8217;t really focus on the 2 (or 3?) recent versions of Android as so few folks have them. <br />
  I highly doubt that this situation will change anytime soon since <del>gasp</del> you can still go buy a <em>brand new</em> Android 2.2 phone <strong>today</strong> from several places.  I&#8217;m not talking a free prepaid plan phone, I mean a contract-pay-money-up-front kind of phone ( AT&amp;T Impulse 4G for example).  <br />
 Google can talk all it likes about keeping things updated, but as long as the carriers are the customers, that&#8217;s not going to change.  Heck, I wonder how much lower that percentage would be if there were not options for jailbreaking, CM, etc.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s so embarrassing about it. They make their money either way.<br />
In terms of app compatibility, once you&#8217;re on 2.1 or higher (aka 99% of people), you&#8217;re golden. There&#8217;s not anything I can think of that requires ICS that doesn&#8217;t have a great alternative for non-ICS users.</p>
<p>Android!</p>
<p>Fragmen&#8230;.. naa, not going to say it.</p>
<p>Damn LG! Get off your butts, I&#8217;m still on 2.3.6!!</p>
<p>Glad to see ICS is <em>finally </em>getting some <em>real </em>traction.</p>
<p>Also, I am the 1(.2)%!</p>
<p>Me too.  Thanks CM10</p>
<p>I bet that half of the ICS are unofficial upgrades.</p>
<p>I am the 1%!<br />
Don&#8217;t wait for your carrier, go install CM10 or AOKP!</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly. They are both solid JB ROMs. Yes AOKP is CM10 kanged (obviously) but it does have some other features integrated that CM10 doesn&#8217;t. They both have their pros and cons.</p>
<p>+1 on the CM10 love.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DlaIb.gif" /></p>
<p>Android 2.3, which came out in December 2010, is still on 57% of all Android devices. But this is irrelevant anyway.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24906278.jpg" /></p>
<p>Wow, welcome to 4 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Sadly the same could be said about Android. 20.8% welcome to last year. ICS was released in October of 2011. I&#8217;m not going to bash android, hell I&#8217;m using a Nexus S and I&#8217;m on Jelly bean. But it is unimpressive that the majority of phones are still running gingerbread (2 years old) and are finally catching up to last years OS.</p>
<p>Carry on. :-)</p>
<p>ICS will be annihilated by it&#8217;s successor. The last devices coming out with ICS are usually more upgradable to Jelly Bean than are Gingerbread devices to ICS. Android is still missing the feature that will cripple the usage of versions before ICS.</p>
<p>ICS is climbing fast. :D</p>
<p>Great. Except ICS is already outdated.</p>
<p>Even FroYo isn&#8217;t obsolete.  What apps do you want to run that work on GB,  HC,  ICS,  or JB but not FroYo.?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d think that running apps is only part of the issue.  How many security and performance improvements has Google put into GB and higher?  What about UI changes?  Is Google even providing patches for 2.3 and below anymore?  Is there a way to run a more modern browser on 2.3 or lower?</p>
<p>The only browser you can&#8217;t run is Chrome. Personally, that&#8217;s maybe my 3rd or 4th preferred browser.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely &#8230; get in there!</p>
<p>Motorola announcing they will upgrade 2011 handsets to 4.1 should help that percentage, even if only by 1%.</p>
<p>Wow, would you look at that&#8230;<br />
According to those who still believes in android however, JB will soon climb past ICS.</p>
<p>Soon*</p>
<ul>
	<li>= 2.5 years</li>
</ul>
<p>If only my Sprint Galaxy Nexus had JB&#8230;</p>
<p>I suggest you install it then.</p>
<p>WANT :O</p>
<p>You fanboy   ;-P</p>
<p>No, he wants one for free after getting banned!</p>
<p>The only way to get one free is to email a hand-drawn picture of a dragon to Samsung Canada.</p>
<p>Or a spider.</p>
<p>Now the cry baby Apple will sue them because it is rectangle and white. Haaa haaa</p>
<p>Yawn</p>
<p>AGREED, DO YOU KNOW HOW GREAT  OF INSTAGRAM PHOTOS YOU CAN MAKE?!</p>
<p>Yeah, let&#8217;s resize those 16MP images to 640&#215;640!</p>
<p>Great idea but would rather a version from Canon or Nikon.</p>
<p>*In regards to photo quality.</p>
<p>Lets be fair, none of us are taking our Canon with us everywhere we go.</p>
<p>True, but most of us do take our Smart Phones everywhere we go. When I travel around I normally pack my backpack and I do carry my point and shoot in it normally in a small case attached to my shoulder strap right up front.</p>
<p>If I think I need my Canon its in my pack, but in the event I haven&#8217;t slung it I have my point and shoot with me.</p>
<p>Where I see this camera is super useful is the fact you can shoot and send via 3G/4G on the fly. I have my EyeFi card in my Cannon, but man nothing is more annoying than having to go back to the house to send a photo opposed to sending via my iPhone.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you link your EyeFi to your iPhone? I think they have an app for that but maybe they require you to have a newer EyeFi</p>
<p>I take my iPad and Sony NEX everywhere with me. I just put them in my bag and off I go.</p>
<p>Nikon &#8211; Android 2.3. Ugh. It&#8217;s obvious the old &#8220;camera companies&#8221; don&#8217;t really understand how to blend smartphone tech with their cameras to create new markets, the way smartphone companies do.</p>
<p>Because no &#8220;smartphone companies&#8221; are still making devices that run Gingerbread.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>No smartphones companies that deserve business are doing it&#8230;</p>
<p>So unfortunately all of them&#8230; :-)</p>
<p>Did they actually release one? My work pwned me today, so i haven&#8217;t been able to go over any of this awesomeness.</p>
<p>I had heard about a 2.3 based camera from them but didn&#8217;t know if there was official word.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s official yes.</p>
<p>Arguably, it doesn&#8217;t really need anything higher than Gingerbread. It&#8217;s a camera, it&#8217;s main focus is taking, editing, and sharing pictures. So long as it can accomplish that (and it can), there&#8217;s really no need for anything higher.</p>
<p>I would rather have the Samsung Galaxy Camera. The quality on my Nikon is quite bad. And I&#8217;m getting sick of ugly looking Nikon cameras.</p>
<p>If this takes off, expect to see some pretty awesome photo apps get made.  This is good for Android users who are disappointed in the choice of good photo/photo edititing apps in Google Play.</p>
<p>I want vsco cam for Android already!</p>
<p>OMG best iPhone photo app ever!</p>
<p>Agreed.  There&#8217;s nothing comes remotely close to it for Android, which makes me sad.</p>
<p>yeah, but it sounds like there isn&#8217;t going to be an API for it. I think they just used Android because it was easier to get Samsung devs to skin it than to build a point-and-shoot OS from the ground up.</p>
<p>Same. This may very well be my next camera.</p>
<p>Ill hold out for my pureview :)</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with using my phone as a camera is the hit I take on battery life. If I&#8217;m snapping a lot of pictures, my battery life takes a noticeable hit. This alleviates that concern.</p>
<p>At the cost of carrying an additional chunk of hardware in your pocket/bags.</p>
<p>Chavez on the verge o_O</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it. Does Hugo want one of these?</p>
<p>wow very nice design.</p>
<p>Except, where am I supposed to put my thumb?</p>
<p>Do we need to tell you?</p>
<p>I see what you did there.</p>
<p>Check the video.</p>
<p>You hold it the way you hold your smartphone when taking pictures.</p>
<p>Why isn&#8217;t Samsung&#8217;s camera department designing their phones? This is quite attractive, and yet their phones are hideous.</p>
<p>Their phones pre-Apple lawsuit had a unified look, plasticy, yes, but they had a sort of nice look to them. Post-Apple lawsuit they&#8217;ve changed their design philosophy so that they can&#8217;t get sued for looking too similar, and that&#8217;s why the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note 10.1 were both the ugliest Samsung products in a long, long time.</p>
<p>I think its also because its just so damn hard to find good designers in Asia outside of Japan.  The Asian schooling system might be great for churning out Engineers but it just isn&#8217;t conducive to developing creativity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why some of the best car designers in the world are Korean. Search for Korean Car Designers Make Their Mark On the U.S. Auto Industry / Korean Car Designers Take Ferrari Design Award.</p>
<p>Some of the top Japanese car designers have called the Koreans, the Italians of the East. In Fashion, a lot of Koreans are becoming the top designers. Same goes for Art. Perhaps China doesn&#8217;t have much good designers but Korea &amp; Japan are both filled with great designers.</p>
<p>Please, show me a Korean car that looks great&#8230;</p>
<p>The 2012 Genesis<br />

<p>Looks like a Volvo / Mercedes cross. Copying again?</p>
<p>All cars use a similar design. Its a similar thing to phones or cameras, they all need to have certain aspects like doors, 4 wheels, lights, a boot etc. All you can do is change the shapes of these slightly.</p>
<p>also, America outsources a LOT of animation to Korea and Canada. Some of your favorite &#8220;American&#8221; cartoons were likely animated abroad.</p>
<p>I remember reading articles in BusinessWeek of Samsung designers winning multiple awards, for a few years in a row.</p>
<p>For obscure devices, mostly. Not for smartphones.</p>
<p>Opinion much?</p>
<p>LOL&#8230; that&#8217;s actually hilarious seeing that 30 million of those &#8220;ugly&#8221; things have been sold. I prefer a phone to be tech advanced and do what I want it to do vs. being &#8220;cute&#8221;</p>
<p>The majority of people have no taste.</p>
<p>Thats why iPhones sell more than any other product in this world</p>
<p>Since when did more than 3.5 billion people on this world own an iPhone?</p>
<p>Well ShottaNIC, if you want a product to be &#8216;tech advanced&#8217; &#8211; you should really do some more research.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in America, the 10 month old iPhone 4S has a faster GPU than the brand new Samsung Galaxy S3. The iPhone also has better battery life, and more apps (with better security). The new iPhone will no doubt destroy the SG3 even further.</p>

Cool story bro.</p>
<p>You better do some research.</p>
<p>Very disappointed about the 21x optical zoom.<br />
5x, or even 4x would&#8217;ve given way better IQ.<br />
Unfortunately consumers want specs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s optical zoom i don&#8217;t see how it affects image quality.</p>
<p>ignore my comment, just thought of how it will get affected.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Lens design is complex and the longer range you have to optimize over the less you can perfect the IQ.</p>
<p>Good lord, I can&#8217;t believe you got that many recommendations, or that readers here are that clueless.</p>
<p>Lens design is a compromise between IQ, aperture, zoom, and size. If you increase the Zoom, either the lens has to be made bigger, or the aperture smaller, or the IQ worse, or all three.</p>
<p>In this case you can see that they&#8217;ve made the physical aperture size miniscule, because the camera only uses a tiiiiny 1/2.3&quot; sensor.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;d used 5x optical zoom, they could&#8217;ve used a much larger sensor (about 10 times the surface area) while sticking to the same lens size.</p>
<p>The really irritating thing about this is nobody&#8217;s going to freaking USE the 21x zoom.  They&#8217;ll try it out, for fun, then realize the pictures it makes are just godawful and totally ruined by shake, then go back to using 1-5x zoom like sane people.</p>
<p>Seriously, what a disappointment.  God forbid anyone could just crop their images.</p>
<p><strong>But&#8230; 21 &gt; 5?</strong><br />
- <em>Every Consumer</em></p>
<p>Long focal lengths are useful, but I guess the target consumer for this camera will only use it for taking pictures of faraway things.</p>
<p>Exactly. This is sad that even in cameras, Samsung just want to win on numbers on the spec sheet.</p>
<p>Not really..This one is meant for the average Joe.<br />
Real Photographers who know all the details, will probably go for a DSLR</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why it&#8217;s surprising that a lot of people don&#8217;t know the ins and outs of a camera lens. Isn&#8217;t that the kind of thing that only people who are into photography would know?</p>
<p>Case in point: prime lenses, which have no zoom at all, are generally the sharpest lenses with the widest apertures usually much smaller than a comparable zoom. And to top it all off they&#8217;re usually cheaper than zooms.</p>
<p>*insert comma between aperture and usually</p>
<p>No, consumers want mediocrity. Mediocre products appeal to a wide margin, because they appeal to the lowest common denominator. Products that actually show some innovation meanwhile become bound to oblivion. This works practically everywhere.</p>
<p>Addition: Products that appeal to a wide range are not decent in any way, unlike how you may think. They are merely mediocre.</p>
<p>consumers buy stuff, high end consumers are still consumers. Mass marketed product casts a wide net because it&#8217;s a balance between price and value and serves as a first step into an area of interest.</p>
<p>As people hone their interests in a particular direction, the acceptable options for products become fewer and fewer as the products themselves become better and better. Along with those improvements in performance come heftier price tags that do not make sense for the average consumer to purchase initially.</p>
<p>Ultimately buying better equipment doesn&#8217;t make you better at something, that only comes with drive, passion, and patience.</p>
<p>I wish it had 35x optical zoom.</p>
<p>Android smartphone, tablet, TV, camera&#8230;.. better be careful, someone might call me a fanboy O_o</p>
<p>fanboy</p>
<p>go take a shower youre filthy!! jk lol</p>
<p>Android shower.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an app for that.</p>

<p>doesn&#8217;t Samsung make those already??  The one that has a display for a door</p>
<p>Does it come with Sfood?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/appliances/refrigerators" target="new">Yup.</a></p>
<p>Seriously? This actually exists? I&#8217;m not in some parallel universe where things are ever more so slightly mad?</p>
<p>God help us all!</p>
<p>It actually existed for a long, long time now. Won&#8217;t be very difficult to shoehorn Android onto it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/appliances/refrigerators" target="_blank">http://www.samsung.com/us/appliances/refrigerators</a></p>
<p>That is the dumbest thing I have ever seen&#8230;. yet I want one.</p>
<p>has 3g/4g modems = $600 or require a contract&#8230;.</p>
<p>Please no. I want this but can&#8217;t justify $600 for a point and shoot, I could get a new m4/3 for that&#8230; $400 wifi only please?</p>
<p>Especially a Samsung point and shoot.</p>
<p>Just WiFi and I can tether it.</p>
<p>so.. can you also make calls on it? :D</p>
<p>Or just use a prepaid SIM.</p>
<p>Assuming the networks allow such a thing.</p>
<p>In most parts of the world that is the case.</p>
<p>I believe this is what you call a phonecamera.</p>

<p>CameraPhablet</p>
<p>Smart-Camera</p>
<p>Heh. There first device with (the superior) software buttons, and it&#8217;s a camera. Also, I would like one of these. I hope Sony does something one day.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got software buttons but they&#8217;ve replaced the multitasking key with a menu key? They REALLY don&#8217;t like the multitasking button do they?</p>
<p>I prefer the menu button. One of the things i miss about android whilst on iOS. I always knew where the menu was, and going back was a snap. I can just hold home for multitasking.</p>
<p>If its software buttons with multitasking button, you&#8217;re getting the menu button anyway. But not the other way around.</p>
<p>All these new Samsung devices are launching with Jelly Bean. PDK is work?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been thinking, too. Now we just need to see what HTC, Moto, and the rest are up to.</p>
<p>working*</p>
<p>Somewhat. ASUS got their update out in record time, Samsung already got a couple of decently functioning leaks. Haven&#8217;t heard about anyone else though.</p>
<p>ASUS Updates tend to be riddled with bugs though. I&#8217;d really like them to hold off on releasing a bit longer and get their quality up.</p>
<p>So can i receive and place calls on it?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m wondering as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear. Probably not, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p>I would assume it would be data only like a tablet.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m assuming $10/mo access on Verizon/ATT.</p>
<p>I think this, but we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Probably not off the rip, but if there is bluetooth capability (for a speaker and mic), likely the modders will get it working in time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine since it runs android, that once it is rooted you will be able to make calls i bet.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t the article say &#8220;3g/4g&#8221; and &#8220;MicroSIM&#8221; and partnering with mobile carriers for release? And isn&#8217;t the first sentence of the article &#8220;What happens when you combine a pocket camera with an Android smartphone?&#8221; (note the &#8220;smartphone&#8221; part).</p>
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t allow receiving/placing calls, then I&#8217;ve been severely mislead.</p>

Another Apples dream of bringing a new meaning to the camera market just got blobbed-away like a soap bubble.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>I doubt it. The 4S still has one of the best smartphone cameras, and this device, while super cool, is a niche device. Most people, myself included, wouldn&#8217;t want to carry around something like this as a primary device, as it&#8217;s just too damn big. I could see my wife wanting one, but she keeps her phone in her purse, not her pocket. And who knows what this thing will cost?</p>
<p>Also, it pretty clearly doesn&#8217;t have a mic or a speaker in the right places to be used like a phone.  So this is obviously just a camera that happens to have android on it.</p>
<p>.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
You are mixing up a smartphone with a camera. Galaxy camera is not a smartphone which differentiate it very much. Some folks do care about iq and prefer to carry a bigger, bulkier device. It may for now occure being a kind of niche product, but it certainly won&#8217;t be. It show very good direction of how to implement mobile open platform enriching yet closed ecosystem.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if all compact cameras start coming with Android in a year or two.</p>
<p>Plus this is 1st gen.  Just think of all the riffing that will happen that&#8217;ll add new features and quality.</p>
<p>Yes, and be sure that&#8217;s the way Asians innovate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Innovation by commercialization&#8221;, it was called by GM&#8217;s China CEO.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be perfectly fine with this if they take from Nikon and allow smartboot, some don&#8217;t have to wait for the camera to load Android before I can take pictures.</p>
<p>Most people still have a dedicated camera for occasions when they know beforehand they will have to take photos (trips &amp; vacations) because on these occasions, they want something better than a smartphone camera. The device is for these people. Plus, if you have an Android cellphone/tablet, countless possibilities open themselves for working with the data created in the process. It is a neat concept, and if it catches on (which actually is rather likely, because it will make development of cameras cheaper and offer an instant ecosystem), it will be a huge plus for Android.</p>
<p>lol if you think this will eat away at iPhone sales.</p>
<p>No one thinks or said that? If it is successful, in the long run, all it might be is an advantage for the Android ecosystem.</p>
<p>More devices which &#8216;technically&#8217; run Android but actually are not what any normal user would describe as a smartphone, to further distort Android usage stats?</p>
<p>See! this is cool!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a bit of a problem with how it seems this is going to be sold. If I was going to get this, I&#8217;d want it to be sold in a manner similar to a tablet or a PSVita. Who the heck wants to sign a contract for a camera? I&#8217;d never use something like that as my main phone, at best the Android OS would be a very nice bonus, but not worth signing a second contract. It should be marketed as a primarily wifi device, with the option of buying a SIM for a contract-free flat monthly rate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really neat device, but if I was going to upgrade from my iPhone 4S camera with another contract device, it would probably be a PureView WP8 device, which would be a lot more phone-ish in form factor.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? 3G/4G are just simply options you either use or not. Nothing changes the functionality of a <strong>camera</strong>. The cam can behave similarly to an iPad, it will still however be a camera, not a (smart)phone.</p>
<p>You got it all wrong. They&#8217;re not selling this through carriers.</p>
<p>Finally, finally&#8230; with this, I can finally win in Instagram.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re playing Instagram wrong bro.</p>
<p>1. use DSLR to take picture<br />
2. copy to phone sd-card<br />
3. upload to instagram<br />
4. ???<br />
5. win?</p>
<p>Insert WiFi-enabled SD card somewhere in that equation and your path to Instagram domination might got a little easier.</p>
<p>PureView WP8 makes sense ? Phone with amazing camera  rather than a point and shoot that can make calls ?<br />
For $600-$700 can&#8217;t I get a low end beginners SLR ?<br />
Imagine someone talking to their camera.. lol</p>
<p>saying this a WiFi only version makes more sense..</p>
<p>This has the superior optical zoom instead of using digital zoom. They are different products.</p>
<p>It might be &#8220;superior&#8221; in that it zooms farther, but IQ won&#8217;t be as good.</p>
<p>I&#8230;  actually don&#8217;t hate it as much as I expected to.  Did you catch the battery capacity?  It&#8217;s blurry in the shot with the battery but it looks like it starts with a 1, and that&#8217;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>1650mAh, 6-7 hours of Android use or 290 shots according to CIPA standards.</p>
<p>So, this is a phone right? I mean i know it&#8217;s a camera, but it&#8217;s a Phone right?</p>
<p>If the SIM slot is any indicator &#8211; this is the weirdest phone I&#8217;ve seen since the ngage.</p>
<p>shudders* The N-Gage :(</p>
<p>SIM doesn&#8217;t necessarily imply phone, i.e voice.  LTE uses SIM.  So the thought of &#8220;My camera has LTE&#8221; is quite berzonkers.  now is there a way to get Voice over LTE, or Google voice over data or something?</p>
<p>Skype?</p>
<p>good point, but i was more thinking something free that could connect to a normal phone #</p>
<p>A tripod mount! more phones need that LOL.</p>
<p>Finally a JB phone that has no hardware buttons&#8230; oh wait&#8230; uh?</p>
<p>As weird as the idea sounds, the camera doesn&#8217;t look bad. Maybe Instagram pictures will get better with this camera. <br />
Though as soon as the Samsung guy said subsidized the whole thing turned into a major turnoff.</p>
<p>What exactly is it weird? Apps for cameras? Why do you have apps on your phone then?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily see Android thriving on camera products. That&#8217;s the weird part.</p>
<p>i like it but&#8230;<br />
wow&#8230;&#8230;.. an F&#8217;ing MENU BUTTON on a JB device??? <br />
samsung has got it wrong man&#8230; jesus christ.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s first and foremost a camera, easy access to your camera settings seems more important than multitasking.</p>
<p>Do you see this SONY?!</p>
<p>Now even your competition cameras have a newer version of the Android OS than your just announced flagship smartphones!!!</p>
<p>Sony may not be available at this time to reply to your comment, they&#8217;re too busy manufacturing the best compact camera in the market (rx100).</p>
<p><img src="http://ihatedolphins.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/spock_fascinating.jpg" /></p>
<p>Shame they went with micro SD on this.<br />
There is no reason why they couldn&#8217;t have gone with stands SDHC or SDXC.<br />
The cards for SDHC  are cheaper and larger capacities avilable.</p>
<p>it seems to me this product is directed to a smartphone user audience looking for a dedicated camera. if that&#8217;s the case, using microSD makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>WHAT IN THE HELL?!!!!! Android camera&#8217;s??? dcasFDVqw$$334</p>
<p>I agree, I don&#8217;t like this, or the idea of mobile OS cameras one bit.</p>
<p>this will be a blessing. the interfaces of real cameras are horrible. for work i use a nikon d700, its interface is an abomination, i have used canon and a couple of others and its the same. android is not a mobile OS, can run everywhere and is good for many things, perfect even for cameras. i hope this means android will finally come to the dslr market.</p>
<p>WE HAVE A WINNER!!!</p>
<p>This is actually very good. Never expected it to be. And Jellybean, and good going Samsung!</p>
<p>Really like this concept! With the playstore on there too, very nice! Can&#8217;t wait for pricing info.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stop worrying about Android when my Nexus 7 stops draining its own battery while idle.  I&#8217;m sure an offline device will last better, but if two years of using Android has taught me anything, it&#8217;s not to trust it to have power when I need it.  Just what I need in a camera that I&#8217;m not regularly using/charging.</p>
<p>Oh great, it&#8217;s not even offline.  Prepare to keep the thing constantly plugged in if you want it to be ready when you need it.</p>
<p>No kidding, my phone is even worse than my Nexus 7. 17 hours and it drops 30%!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jsqFx.png" /></p>
<p>ICS with Droid Sans? What did you do to that poor phone?</p>
<p>Yeah, cuz charging every 3.75 days sucks.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pF7YG.png" /></p>
<p>It does compared to an iPhone with 200 hours standby time.</p>
<p>Hmm, Glad I didn&#8217;t get you N7 then. Mine is at 78% after 9h 21m and 38 seconds. I regularly see 16 hours with moderate to heavy usage since my N7 is what I read on. And to give you an idea of how much I read, I have gone through 8 books so far just in the month of August. Most of my battery is used up by the screen. I never turn Wi-Fi off. Hell, GPS and sync are on too. Only 4% has been used by Tablet Idle. You can&#8217;t expect it to automagically not use any battery when idle. Here is one of my longest running on battery. <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DLbTVryVVvU/UCsd8g7MY2I/AAAAAAAAKuQ/S2fESnCF114/s789/Screenshot_2012-08-14-22-55-17.png" /></p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you check out your battery stats to see what is draining it.  It&#8217;s probably some of your apps that keep waking the device up.</p>
<p>because he doesn&#8217;t actually own one and he was just trolling?</p>
<p>Because a criticism of an Android device must necessarily be trolling, they are infallible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m listening. Now how about a price?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t see the YouTube video preview on my iPad&#8230;. KHHHHHHHAAAAAAANNNNNNN</p>
<p>That looks exactly like an iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple is suing because it&#8217;s diluting the iCamera&#8217;s trade dress.</p>
<p>Sensor size??? Can this compete with PureView at all?</p>
<p>It most likely uses a 1/2.3&quot; sensor.</p>
<p>And Nikon&#8217;s Android camera just got thrown into the bargain bin even before release.</p>
<p>Utterly stupid move Nikon.</p>
<p>You do realize there are different markets for different devices right?</p>
<p>Are there really? Well if you say so.</p>
<p>yes, there are different markets for different devices.<br />
the coolpix and the galaxy camera happen to be in EXACTLY the same market.</p>
<p>They should redesign the shape of this, going to be so awkward to answer calls.</p>
<p>Except you can&#8217;t answer calls with this</p>
<p>Interesting idea. I&#8217;m sure you will get strange looks though when people see you talking into your camera.</p>
<p>I would always like a better camera. I have a 4S and its camera is great, but I wouldn&#8217;t want something like this. If they ditch the optical zoom (And just have a fixed lens at 24mm equivalent) and just keep a larger lens + sensor I would be up for that.</p>
<p>This is innovation. Take that fruit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a camera, it&#8217;s not original or innovative.</p>
<p>Using a free open source operating system developed by another company is hardly innovative either.</p>
<p>So&#8230; Apple is not innovative at all? They&#8217;re getting everything from everyone else.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight, it&#8217;s not a phone at all? I can&#8217;t make calls on it?</p>
<p>let me explain it in a gew words:</p>
<p>it&#8217;s a goddamned CAMERA.</p>
<p>WiFi only for less than $400 and I&#8217;m in.</p>
<p> So it&#8217;s my understanding from this article that this is not, in fact, a phone.  Right?  If it was that would be a great idea.  That would put it in a very unique and interesting position.  But if it&#8217;s just a camera it has to be judged against all other similarly priced cameras.  As the article itself points out, the android aspect is important only insofar as it improves the camera.</p>
<p>Just because you can put Android onto a camera doesn&#8217;t make it a good idea.</p>
<p>Who says it&#8217;s a good idea &#8220;just because&#8221;?</p>
<p>Who claimed someone said that?</p>
<p>Why not ?</p>
<p>dammit can i make calls on it or not!?</p>
<p>I thought that smartphones were killing (had killed) the point and shoot camera market? Also, seriously don&#8217;t need another 3G/4G device placed on my att/verizon bill.</p>
<p>yea no fucking way im paying for extra 3g for a camera but if i can use it as my phone, even through a bluetooth headset, im very interested. I wish they were more specific about that</p>
<p>Hot&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; spot.</p>
<p>here are the complete specs for the phone, can anyone tell me if this can be a phone or not?? <br />
<a href="http://d35lb3dl296zwu.cloudfront.net/uploads/photo/image/7649/bandicam_2012-08-29_14-11-40-202.jpg" target="_blank">http://d35lb3dl296zwu.cloudfront.net/uploads/photo/image/7649/bandicam_2012-08-29_14-11-40-202.jpg</a></p>
<p>everything was good till i saw the battery<br />
battery for camera should be much more important than phone, i guess they presumed most will get a spare battery just like what they did with their cameras.</p>
<p>ooooooh didnt see that&#8230; well thats disappointing :(</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with you that it is absurd in an article that talks about mixing phones with cameras that it does not state whether the device is, in fact, a phone.  But based on what I see, it has radios for data connectivity but will not operate as a phone.</p>
<p>so technically id still be able to make calls and recieve texts with a google number?</p>
<p>Not a phone.  3/4G for data only, ala a tablet</p>
<p>No info on sensor size? Lens aperture and focal range? <br />
I wonder how the image quality would stand up against the Pureview,&#8216;s the N8&#8217;s, and even  the 4s&#8217;s. If the camera would turn out to be mediocre, there would be no reason for anyone to even consider this device.</p>
<p>Excellent Camera + Apps = NEX-5R!!</p>
<p>Aperture is only 2.8. :(</p>
<p>This is totally weird, but somehow absolutely awesome. Instagram on a whole new level I guess &#8230;</p>
<p>Well now, other than a hooker is there anything you can&#8217;t buy that doesn&#8217;t have Android on it?!?!?</p>
<p>That hooker will probably be owning an android handset.  So, no.  Nothing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for the refrigerator with android.  Alert me to the last person who left 3 drops of milk in the container so I can bash his/her head in.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t this the kind of plan Google had announced at last year&#8217;s I/O?  I&#8217;m still waiting for the @Home stuff to come to fruition (I think that&#8217;s what they called it).</p>
<p> hope motorola makes one to.</p>
<p>Oh yes, cannot wait for a camera that force closes every second photo.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Wow&#8230; Will we be able to use this as a phone? O_____O</p>
<p>This camera got Jelly Bean before the LTE Galaxy Nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>I blame Verizon for this.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget Sprint.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/29/jelly-bean-pre-release-for-verizon-galaxy-nexus-now-available/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/29/jelly-bean-pre-release-for-verizon-galaxy-nexus-now-available/</a></p>
<p>VZW just needs to approve this JRO03O build before the Galaxy Camera comes out.</p>
<p>Cue the Canon vs Samsung legal debacle.</p>
<p>No worries here. Samsung will never be able to reproduce the quality of a Cannon. =)</p>
<p>Awesome! Now I can finally play Fruit Ninja with a camera!</p>
<p>Everything about this just screams bad. Then again, I have a DSLR and would never touch a PAS. But voice control on a camera? Give me a break. I really do not like the idea of a mobile OS on a damn camera. And it doesn&#8217;t even shoot in RAW&#8230;shame.</p>
<p>They do not give a sh*t, as you mentioned yourself several times that you are nowhere near the target consumer. This is a PAS, that you do not want it if you &#8220;would never touch a PAS&#8221; is clear, trivial, and a pointless comment.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen&#8230; INNOVATION.</p>
<p><del>Sept 12th</del></p>
<p>Tim Cook: &#8220;I give you&#8230; the iCamera!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes innovation.</p>
<p>Take a digital camera, which have been around for decades, and shove a free operating system onto it made by a third party&#8230;..</p>
<p>This looks nice. I can see some benefits of using android on a camera. Easy uploading and sharing on dozens of apps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really a camera person but I kinda want this. So many possibilities!</p>
<p>This is the first Android product I&#8217;ve wanted since&#8230; well&#8230; ever. Gimme.</p>
<p>Developers of photographic apps like Instagram now will have no option but to target Android first now, methinks.</p>
<p>This.  This is what Android was created.  Not just for phones but for all different kinds of gadgets.</p>
<p>Windows pretty much already has this covered. Windows embedded is in ATMs, car dashes, POS machines etc Actually Linux has this covered too and Android is just a fork of Linux pretty much.</p>
<p>What did he say? He said they&#8217;re looking to partner up with carriers? WTF!!!?? This may not be an issue outside the US, but if this even remotely makes it into the US, it will be carrier-raped. Now your camera is carrier locked and controlled. Bullcr@p Samsung. And here I was somewhat interested in this. Clearly they are only interested in helping the carriers to rape you more. &#8220;Oh, you want to use x feature of your camera? There will be an additional $$ on your monthly payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>I really like the design language of this device. Why didn&#8217;t they used this kind of shapes and colors for their Ativ tablets?</p>
<p>I.Want.</p>
<p>i cant wait to see &#8220;force close&#8221; on my camera while taking pictures :p</p>
<p>Can it play Shadowgun?</p>
<p>I wonder if there would be any restrictions on the types of apps you can get from the <strike>Market</strike> Google Play store. I&#8217;d like to play Cut the Rope when taking pictures.</p>
<p>Apple has prior art.  See &#8220;leaked&#8221; LEAKED Official Apple iPhone 5 Promo Video &#8211; Keynote 2012</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/uIRBxRlsYR0" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/uIRBxRlsYR0</a></p>
<p>Battery life?  hope it&#8217;s a big battery aka Droid Razr MAXX.<br />
Also, please be rootable to get rid of that touchPiss crap UI.<br />
But, in looking at the UI/Menus, it looks like touchPiss might be necessary to operate the camera.  crap. :(</p>
<p>Wow can Samsung already put Android on Microwaves. I want to check emails while my popcorn burns.</p>
<p>Take photos of your food while it burns and send what your nuking to Facebook. Swipe the glass and play Angry Birds. LOL</p>
<p>I want one too.</p>
<p>mobile operators?</p>
<p>so wait i can only purchase one of these bad boys through contract? psh yeah okay. m sure i can just snag one from samsung.</p>
<p>now about that price&#8230;</p>
<p>I want this for some reason but I do not know what for&#8230;</p>
<p>THIS IS SOO COOOL! I NEED ONE NOWWW!!!</p>
<blockquote>It coexists with the rest of the point and shoots at the high end.</blockquote>
<p><em>~ Ryan Bidan, Director of Product Marketing, Samsung Mobile US</em></p>
<p>Yes, in a world with no RX100.</p>
<p>Jury&#8217;s still out on the performance and price of this camera</p>
<p>Hugely unlikely Samsung have produced a better camera despite starting with a slower lens, mediocre optics and a comparatively tiny sensor.</p>
<p>Patent law is one thing… the laws of physics are much, much harder to break.</p>
<p>It better be a lot cheaper… but I don&#8217;t see how they can do that with that massive screen and sophisticated circuitry.</p>
<p>They focus on their cellphone cameras for general audience. For people who care about image quality, they should focus on their NX compact system cameras, or a RX100 rival.</p>
<p>AND NOW SAMSUNG PRESENTE THE ALL NEW HIPSTER CAMERA</p>
<p>Well, this is just stupid device. Point-and-shoot cameras are on decline because of smartphones and what samsung creates is a point-and-shoot camera that is not a phone? I can run apps on this camera which would be cool if I couldn&#8217;t run the same apps on my <strong>phone</strong> that I&#8217;ll have in my pocket <strong>anyway</strong> at any given time. So what&#8217;s the point of this device?</p>
<p>Also, while it looks OK design wise it is a usability horror. There&#8217;s no room for fingers. Just watching preview video where reviewer tries to show how to hold it pains me. Android software buttons <strong>exactly</strong> where most people will put their thumb while trying to take a picture is just <strong>great</strong> idea&#8230;</p>
<p>I see the point in making smartphone cameras better like Nokia did with their PureView phones. Going back to separate point-and-shoots is just not going to work.</p>
<p>Thanks, but no thanks, Samsung.</p>
<p>BLA BLA BLAS..! SHH HATER..! GO NA HATE.! THIS DEVICE IS **** AWEZOOOM!</p>
<p>There will always be a place for Point and Shoot cameras. I&#8217;m a iPhone and a DSLR owner and I can say without a doubt my 4year old Point and Shoot takes better photos than my 4S. Normally I shoot with my DSLR first &gt; Point and Shoot &gt; 4S.</p>
<p>We all use what we have and if I&#8217;m packing all 3 which I have several times my Smart Phone will always be last. I don&#8217;t claim to be a Pro or anything, but somebody that takes tons of photos and has compared many times.</p>
<p>The reason this will sell is because it has a better lense. Of course not looking at the sensor it could be purely garbage and my entire argument is moot. LOL</p>
<p>Why would it have android 4.1 ???</p>
<p>Probably for the smoothness that is Project Butter.</p>
<p>I think most people are going about this the wrong way, comparing it to smartphones. They should be comparing it to cameras. There is still a market for point-and-shoots, and they still take better pictures than smartphones. Out of the box, a smartphone will not compare to it on several factors. True optical zooming &gt; digital zooming, macro photos will be better with the point-and-shoot, low-light pictures will be better, having the flash further away from the lens will help prevent red eye without having to digitally remove it. Having better light sensors than smartphones due to the increased body size, as well as better shutter speed control. The list could go on and on&#8230; all features that are in regular cameras, with the added benefit of having an OS behind it that will let you do more with the pictures <strong>after</strong> you take them.</p>
<p>Honestly, the OS itself makes little difference in how this thing operates (which is why the Nikon camera with 2.3 might still be a good option.) It&#8217;s the fact that you can take a much higher quality picture that matters most. Android lets you edit the photos on the fly using various apps, back them up to the cloud, send them to Google+/Facebook/Picasa/Flickr/etc. But it&#8217;s not meant to replace your current smartphone, it&#8217;s meant to replace your current point-and-shoot. Many people including myself still use point-and-shoots on a regular basis (especially when I don&#8217;t want to lug an DSLR around but still know I&#8217;ll be taking pictures and want better control over the pictures I take.)  I think it&#8217;s only a matter of time until ALL point-and-shoot camera&#8217;s do the same thing.</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p> you missed the most obvious upgrades..<br />
1. the sensor will be larger affording better depth of field and higher iso&#8217;s..<br />
2. Glass optics instead of plastic.</p>
<p>Wished it had the front lcd screen.</p>
<p>why? most people I know never take self portraits and the one camera that had that feature was taken off the market fast because it was so unpopular.</p>
<p>I have Samsung&#8217;s flip-screen camera, and it comes in handy for taking family pictures. Then again, I don&#8217;t like to bother strangers with taking pictures for us; for one thing, I feel like I&#8217;m annoying them, and another half the time it doesn&#8217;t come out good and I would feel really bad asking them to try again.</p>
<p>Flipping the screen around allows me to line up the shot and take the picture myself.</p>
<p>I do not need a new camera. But for some reason, I cannot help but to WANT this.</p>
<p>I really like this concept. The camera itself looks great. I however would prefer it in a DSLR body. I carry my Nikon around with me pretty much everywhere, I don&#8217;t really need a point and shoot.</p>
<p>What do you use as a backup camera? Personally I carry a small Point and Shoot that has served me well for many years. Do I think this is its replacement? Not sure&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>I have an old point and shoot that I have for tossing in my pack when I know a DSLR is impractical to use. Example is one of my hobbies is multi-day canoe trips. As I don&#8217;t have a waterproof case for the Nikon, I&#8217;ll take my old point and shoot. It fits nicely in one of my dry boxes. But in everyday use I don&#8217;t carry a backup, unless you count my phone. Which I really don&#8217;t since the GNex is not known for it&#8217;s quality sensor or anything like that.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t Sony put Jellybean on a phone if Samsung can do it on a camera.</p>
<p>My guess: carriers get less involved when it&#8217;s a camera.</p>
<p>Besides, this is coming out in Q4, that&#8217;s still a few months away. Sony has time to catch up.</p>
<p>This is backwards technology. I&#8217;m guessing it doesn&#8217;t sell very well at all.</p>
<p>Samsung should put the smartphone in the camera, not a camera in the smartphone. I don&#8217;t mind a slightly thicker phone, if I get optical zoom, image stabilisation</p>
<p>Ive been telling friends for years that i hate camera phones and that i wanted a phone camera. Just when I thought Nikon figured it out Sammy one ups them. The nikon looks about 400 times nicer to carry around in your pocket all the time though. shame it had no phone in it too.</p>
<p>But you still have to climb in and out via the windows, because Apple has patented doors.</p>
<p>Does it come with S-Photo for sharing?</p>
<p>Any idea of how much this will cost roughly?!</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a Camera why it is a Phone! Just because you can put Android on anything doesn&#8217;t mean you should, instead this Camera needs a nice camera software not the full Android! It is not a Phone!</p>
<p>And why you need a SIM card and LTE with this thing!</p>
<p>I am very confused!</p>
<p>The iPad 4G has a SIM card and LTE. Explain that.</p>
<p>probably for uploading pictures and video from anywhere, hopefully the carriers package with a decent plan that doesn&#8217;t feel like a rip-off. Oh, who am I kidding? Of course the carriers are going to try to rip off the consumer, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re good at. AT&amp;T will probably require you to be on a shared data plan, and charge the same for this camera as they do for a smartphone. Verizon will probably do similarly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more interested in a Wi-Fi version of this camera.</p>
<p>So is having a whole Android OS on your camera or is the Wifi link that Samsung and now Sony are doing make more sense?</p>
<p>I would like to see a duel against the 808 PureView!</p>
<p>Frankencamera. This is very ugly and reminds me of the way cereal companies try to sell you the leftover bits from their factory floor as a whole new cereal! The use of the micro SD card slot&#8230; They must have a fortune of them lying around or something.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure Samsung just prefers microSD over SD for their devices, we have a Samsung point-and-shoot that only takes microSD as well.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a little bit thicker than the Nokia <strike>Lumia PureView</strike> 808<br />

<p>Wow Samsung has suprisingly made a good Android-compatible camera. I might actually buy this&#8230; my Nikon is getting old.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy Camera. Designed for hipsters.</p>
<p>Best group shot sounds awesome for me, it&#8217;s hard to get good family pictures cause the kid doesn&#8217;t smile for long enough to take the picture. I wonder if that app would work on regular smartphones&#8230;</p>
<p>See samsung mobile learn how to design from your other divisions you retards</p>
<p>Looks like a super smart point and shoot with a great screen.  If only it could make calls&#8230;</p>
<p>If only it could send text&#8217;s, you could watch a recorded video and send a text message at the same time! ohh wait</p>
<p>I would have been totally interested in taking a serious look at this to see what kind of use it enabled for me.<br />
But I was stopped dead at &#8216;marketed and sold through mobile carriers&#8217;.</p>
<p>Apple will never come out with something like this as this is a silly product.</p>
<p>The screen looks gorgeous :D</p>
<p>The fact that they have to sell it through carrriers underlines the problem with wireless data in North America.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t I just buy it as is, untethered to any carrier and get a data plan where I want (or use the one I have now?)</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re at it &#8211; since 3G is the same regardless of the older tech under it &#8211; why not get some standards going and have all frequencies supported including 1700 so we can use it wth cheaper carriers like Wind?</p>
<p>My only question is why does it have 3G/4G I understand wifi but not that&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://images1.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Camera-Phone-flight-of-the-conchords-1118337_300_300.jpg" /></p>
<p> I want a Google Nexus camera&#8230;</p>
<p>Can I get this clear&#8230;. it as 3G, but is it a PHONE?<br />
Can I make phone calls on it?  Not Skype internet calls, but proper boring telephone calls.</p>
<p>Why no video or shots of it being used as a phone?</p>
<p>I can say if I was in the market for a new point and shoot camera I would definitely be getting one of these.  But I already have a good Nikon D70 and a Canon PowerShot G9 but to get JellyBean and a 16 Megapixel camera is a sweet package plus all of the wireless connectivity and an HD display.  WOW.</p>
<p>Holy Sh!it</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t make this stuff up! :D</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinned.com/pin/54a367d629152b720749e187b3eaa11b" target="_blank">http://www.pinned.com/pin/54a367d629152b720749e187b3eaa11b</a></p>
<p>When I ditch my Skyrocket for the new iPhone, I&#8217;m getting this. I have never used a camera phone better than my Skyrocket, and Samsung makes THE BEST default camera app, and this looks just as great too.</p>
<p>So it has 3/4G, but can you make calls on it?</p>
<p>Someone will hack it so you can, but it will not launch with that functionality out of the gate.</p>
<p>I wonder if this has NFC. It would be interesting for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Very good idea! But this particular product looking kinda bulky, therefore sort of useless. I&#8217;d love to have a great camera + Internet pocket device + Very high quality media player in &#8216;One&#8217;, but not this poorly designed by Samsung mixture.</p>
<p>16MP is very high resolution. Higher resolution than many cameras on the market.</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t.  Check some more recent point and shoots.  A lot have 16.1mp at the very least.</p>
<p>Also megapixels are nothing (well not really but having a billion megapixels isn&#8217;t all that amazing if you&#8217;re just going to instagram that shit).  What is important is sensor size.  This has a sensor size of 1/2.3&quot; which is your typical non-high end point and shoot.  From a camera functionality point of view, its directly targeting people who only care about megapixels and zoom &#8211; those who don&#8217;t know a lot about camera technology.</p>
<p>Wow, 120fps! if only it was at HD res.</p>
<p>Really impressive. Koreans are embracing software. Canon and Nikon should really start getting worried.</p>
<p>The digital camera market is declining rapidly. They should be more worried about that, as should Samsung.</p>
<p>Not really&#8230; People aren&#8217;t buying point and shoots anymore. Oddly enough phones are becoming good enough to replace point and shoots, and nowadays you can buy a low end DSLR for the price of this thing. So Canon and Nikon who cover the high end in photography have nothing to worry about at the moment, at least not because of this&#8230; maybe sony&#8230;</p>
<p>Antivirus firms cannot be happier, just image, they can sell antivirus for your camera now!</p>
<p>there are no viruses on android.</p>
<p>Android Market last time I checked was swarming with virii.</p>
<p>I may not be reading all of the comments/info on this story but has anyone tried this thing or touched it? My big question is will it allow aftermarket apps(camera apps) to utilize all of the camera features. Can we use HDR cam, Instagram, or many hundreds of other &#8220;camera&#8221; apps? Or will it send all images through Samsung&#8217;s Gallery app? Can we shoot RAW? Will it automatically compress those to be posted or sent? I&#8217;m really interested in this as I was the Nikon when I heard about it. Can you imagine a full frame dslr with Android and you can use all of the camera/photo apps on Play Store? That would be INSANE! Multiple lenses, multiple types of apps for almost any shooting situation. I can&#8217;t wait to see where this goes. Or it could be that Nikon and Samsung just use Android as the brains and don&#8217;t allow any photo or camera apps. That would be very shortsighted and SUCK!  Oh well, I&#8217;ll keep reading and see what&#8217;s up.</p>
<p>ill buy one.,<br />
i also want a galaxy fridge, galaxy oven and a galaxy washer and drying machine</p>
<p>Bringing the camera back. Nice one Samsung.</p>
<p>the creative possibilities of this will be amazing. everyone who knows what chdk or magic lantern is will agree. and these were just hacks. hacks that made photographers switch from nikon to canon, nonetheless. especially open lantern had such a big impact. an open framework is the biggest thing to happen for the camera market since the dslr, this will start a revolution.</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230; I like the idea but I don&#8217;t think it was executed too well. First of all, I feel like the way I hold a camera  my thumb would be resting largely on on right side of the screen. Secondly, it wasn&#8217;t too obvious from the hands on but the interface seemed more showy than actually useful, I don&#8217;t really want to go through a million animations and screens to get to the iso setting.</p>
<p>Other than that, really interesting product and samsung is really the only company in a position to offer something like this at the moment.</p>
<p>I wonder how many suckers are going to buy that.<br />
The money would be better spent on a DSLR from Canon or Nikon.</p>
<p>Sorry I&#8217;m not a photographer and would be much better off buying a Samsung Galaxy Camera rather than some chunky ugly Nikon DSLR.</p>
<p>I have a Nikon camera and it&#8217;s getting too old.</p>
<p>I want something new.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see a soft key for multitasking, just the back home and menu. I&#8217;m guessing you have to long press the home button? But seriously? They didn&#8217;t think they would just put one more soft key.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Note 2 will launch with 4.1</p>
<p>Pretty sure it will.</p>
<p>After owning a carrier locked GS II Skyrocket and seeing that release time, I&#8217;d be shocked if the note two has jelly bean.</p>
<p>kinda how the Note 1 launched with GB instead of ICS?</p>
<p>I hold no breaths for this one.</p>
<p>The note launched two months before the Galaxy Nexus. In europe haha!</p>
<p>But launched after the super bowl in the US (with heavy ass advertising), still had GB on it.</p>
<p>dont think so</p>
<p>Awesome. I&#8217;m freaking loving 4.1.&#215;. As many good things as I&#8217;ve heard about the SIII, besides s-voice, it will only enhance the experience even more.</p>
<p>Speaking of S-Voice&#8230;Samsung better not remove Google Now/Voice Search from their Android 4.1 update.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d be that stupid, but it sadly wouldn&#8217;t surprise me.</p>
<p>they&#8217;ll look like jackasses in both cases anyway</p>
<blockquote>Samsung is still testing Android 4.1 updates for the Galaxy S II and the Galaxy Note, and has not found a reason not to update either device.</blockquote>
<p>&#8230;yet.</p>
<p>Fix&#8217;d.</p>
<p> The Galaxy S11 already has 4.1 as does the Galaxy S111 4G here in Australia. I don&#8217;t understand why America is so far behind?  My Galaxy S111 4G is just mind blowing, well worth the wait.</p>
<p>Because using &#8216;I&#8217; for Roman Numerals is too mainstream</p>
<p>I think you mean 4.0 &#8230;</p>
<p>what&#8217;s Galaxy S111 4G?? You mean Galaxy SIII LTE verision??</p>
<p>Way to go Samsung&#8230;unfortunately add 3 &#8211; 6 months delay from the useless US carriers.</p>
<p>That is why you should always buy the manufacturers model.</p>
<p>But the problem with that is that you don&#8217;t get LTE.</p>
<p>But HSPA+ is more then enough for most people.</p>
<p>After having LTE for nearly 8 months now, there&#8217;s no way I would go back to HSPA+ unless it was on T-Mobile.<br />
AT&amp;T&#8217;s HSPA+ network still sucks (3 to 5 Mbps download speeds). Fortunately I live in an area where their LTE service is simply awesome. 30+Mbps download speeds are pretty consistent.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m and LTE user, but I&#8217;m in Tech so I&#8217;m constantly around WIFI&#8230; that said I&#8217;d switch back to GSM mainly cuz I could get an official play store device haha. I wanna be back under google&#8217;s controlling grasp.</p>
<p>LTE is technically GSM-based ya know.</p>
<p>By LTE i really meant Verizon&#8217;s LTE. I guess to clarify I&#8217;d rather be back under unlocked GSM phones from the play store. Unless of course Verizon&#8217;s LTE Gnex suddenly gets &#8216;unlocked&#8217; from verizon&#8217;s grasp.</p>
<blockquote> ‘unlocked’ </blockquote>
<p>CDMA and unlocked don&#8217;t usually match lol.</p>
<p>:( very true. I&#8217;m gonna stick through w/ this one. Maybe root eventually. But after this I&#8217;m only buying Google Direct. Unless of course that changes too&#8230;</p>
<p>I can pull around 15Mbps over HSPA+, which I know is slower then LTE but its still enough for any task. But Three UK are always pretty good with interent speeds.</p>
<p>I could handle 15Mbps on HSPA+, but currently I only get 3-5Mbps if I turn off LTE.<br />
I&#8217;ve tried T-Mobile&#8217;s network and they have a consistent 15-20Mbps download speed in my area. Problem is my phone won&#8217;t work on their AWS band.</p>
<p>They are re-farming though?</p>
<p>I live in the UK, so I don&#8217;t have to worry about bands or tech when moving networks but I still read a lot of US news sites.</p>
<p>Yeah they are&#8230; but who knows when they will finally get to my city.<br />
I have an older iPhone running on their EDGE network that my daughter uses. It&#8217;s my guinea pig. Waiting for the day I see the 3G logo appear. ;)</p>
<p>You guys are so lucky.  I get between 20kb-300kb on my S2 on AT&amp;T.  I hate AT&amp;T so much..</p>
<p>We will have to wait and see, but I think that the fact of the GSIII having a smaller number of variants and smaller differences is going to make at least the devlopment faster</p>
<blockquote> GSIII having a smaller number of variants</blockquote>
<p>The S3 has 8 variants.</p>
<p>Moar touch wiz&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually enjoying Touchwiz.  It&#8217;s not that bad, and in event I don&#8217;t want it I can always just slap something over it anyways.</p>
<p>Yeah I agree. M using the GN stock.  In fact, there are some nifty touchwiz tricks I like too&#8230;especially the latest iteration.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to be that guy, but I won&#8217;t be satisfied until I actually see them hit the date they claim regardless of carrier politics.</p>
<p>I have XDA in event they don&#8217;t fall through anyways so not a real big biggie.</p>
<p>Wish Samsung would focus on updating non-American Galaxy Nexi. If the S3 gets Jelly Bean before my Gnex does I will lose all faith in android.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus HSPA got Jelly Bean officially already.</p>
<p>My Galaxy Nexus only got updated to 4.0.2 because i  took it in for repair and that was the latest version they could put on it. I brought it in last week&#8230;</p>
<p>Manually updating to Jelly Bean is not complicated. Go ahead and update to Takju. I did it a few days ago&#8230; No need to root to flash JB through fastboot&#8230;</p>
<p>For some, not all. He might be in the group (similar to LTE Gnex&#8217;s) that are left to rot. I believe there are some GSM Gnex&#8217;s that are on a later rollout cycle.</p>
<p>The LTE GNexus is different hardware though and is a carrier controlled phone, where as the GSM one is not.</p>
<p>Maybe Google has only rolled it out to certain counties, but you should be able to flash the update however from Google&#8217;s site and still be on the official update path.</p>
<p>I think depending on the GSM phone, Yajku Takju Whateverku, some GSM phones were update controlled by samsung so that might delay it.</p>
<p>LTE Gnex &#8211; you&#8217;re correct&#8230; sadly :(.  I&#8217;m waiting till Google releases (leaks) the official JB Rom for it to flash. Verizon won&#8217;t get to it for another 6 months I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p>The only difference between Yajku and Takju was Google Wallet though?</p>
<p>Just Google yakjuxw. Samsung is in charge of updates for a lot of Galaxy Nexuses and, no, they&#8217;re not some weird hardware variant or controlled by evil carriers. They&#8217;re unlocked and unsubsidised GSM Galaxy Nexus phones that don&#8217;t get updates straight from Google. Yakjuxw got 4.0.4 a good 4 months after the yakju and takju builds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to flash a yakju build on it though and after that you will get OTA updates directly from Google. Samsung Germany even released a tool that flashes yakju to yakjuxw phones without requiring you to unlock them. Unfortunately it has been taken down since it&#8217;s old (it flashes build ITL41F). It can be found at the mirror below though and I have confirmed that it&#8217;s the same file as the one previously hosted at samsung.de.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B_tE7ja_zWYWUTQ0M0wtQ3dISk0/edit?docId=0B_tE7ja_zWYWSHF1TS1Bd0YyU3c" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B_tE7ja_zWYWUTQ0M0wtQ3dISk0/edit?docId=0B_tE7ja_zWYWSHF1TS1Bd0YyU3c</a></p>
<p>Screenshot: <a href="http://bit.ly/Mu7Qia" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/Mu7Qia</a></p>
<p>If you intend to unlock the bootloader anyway, you can just flash the full images Google provides instead and remove the need to wait a few minutes for the OTAs from 4.0.1 up to 4.1.1.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the point though.</p>
<p>The answer to the complaint that the flagship Google branded phone isn&#8217;t getting updated by Google and that updates are outsourced to an OEM that delays those updates for absolutely no good reason shouldn&#8217;t be that it&#8217;s OK because the end user could hack the phone with relative ease.  OS updates are a major feature of the Nexus line and neither Google nor Samsung makes it clear at point of sale that the phone you&#8217;re buying has had that feature removed.</p>
<p>This is pretty much the reason why I didn&#8217;t buy a Galaxy Nexus weeks ago and am now thinking hard if it&#8217;s worth getting an Iphone even though it&#8217;s about to be refreshed.</p>
<p>Oh man I&#8217;m curious to see what Samsung is going to do with touchwiz and Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Sweet. And I can&#8217;t wait for Q1 2012 to arrive, so my Galaxy Tab 10.1 will finally get upgraded to ICS, as per Samsung&#8217;s official timeline.</p>
<p>Oh wait&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m moving countries and need a new phone, and the make or break for me will be whether they leave Google&#8217;s features intact. I have Google Now on my Nexus 7 and absolutely love it.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m okay to work around a skin as long as all of Google&#8217;s stuff is still under there. Getting a new phone it&#8217;d be nice to go for the latest and greatest but I will get another Galaxy Nexus if I have to.</p>
<p>If they beat HTC in putting Jellybean on their flagship device, the CEO of HTC should resign.</p>
<p>Its a race to the jelly beans!</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what gets JB first, the One X or the S3.</p>
<p>My HOX demands their head if this happens. Anyway happy news for GSIII owners.</p>
<p>Good, I hope to see this update in the next month or two.</p>
<p>If that effing Phone get&#8217;s Jelly Bean before the Verizon Galaxy Nexus they are going to have some really pissed off users. I will be one of them ready to start a riot.</p>
<p>why does this have to be approved by google?</p>
<p>I was just wondering this myself. Anyone know?</p>
<p>In order to get access to the Google Play store, all custom builds of android that get sold to consumers must get approved by Google to make sure core parts of the OS weren&#8217;t tampered with that Google wants to keep OEMS from messing with.</p>
<p>The ultimate insult would be if this phone got it before the Verizon Galaxy Nexus just for the mere fact that Verizon wants to push GS3&#8217;s and if the GNex gets it first it may draw customers away.</p>
<p>Hopefully, S voice will be replace by Google Now.</p>
<p>Google sells unlocked nexus phones for 349.99 unlocked. IMHO does are the only phones worth owning imo if you care at all about updates</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be sticking with Soundhound. Shazam is on my blacklist, because they tried to sue an Open Source developer that tried to do a similar app, in an Open way, and Google is only trying to get us to purchase music. Soundhound does a lot much more, like show the lyrics on-screen :-P</p>
<p>Does SoundHound not also try to get you to buy music? I have it installed but haven&#8217;t used it in a long time. I&#8217;d imagine that that&#8217;s their business model and if they don&#8217;t have links to Amazon on the Android version I&#8217;d be shocked.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice that they give you lyrics and perhaps they&#8217;ll soon offer more in order to compete, but a widget that&#8217;s part of the system and will let me buy(once the record labels let Google offer music services in the UK) music very easily through my preferred method(I use Play Music to store and stream my songs and would be happy to buy music through it, too) is better for me.</p>
<p>They do offer you a link to buy the music.. but like Nushio said about the Lyrics on screen&#8230; They have live lyrics going with the music.. It&#8217;s actually pretty cool.  That&#8217;s why I use Soundhound :D</p>
<p>from above &#8220;Google is only&#8221; . As it stands right now Soundhound with live lyrics is unbeatable.</p>
<p>I love soundhound for the live lyrics too&#8230; but i guess shazam has the same thign now? my gf pulled it up on her iphone and it did the same thing, but looked cooler lol. Maybe that&#8217;s iphone only though, i dont use shazam so haven&#8217;t tested on android.</p>
<p>Yeah the latest updates to soundhound are pretty nice&#8230; Shows live lyrics (scrolls through as the song is playing).  There&#8217;s also an option to &#8220;play track in Spotify&#8221;, which opens the song right up in Spotify on my phone, and let&#8217;s me add it to a playlist.  That last feature is pretty much a game changer</p>
<p>Well, that Spotify link changes my vote!  Haven&#8217;t used Soundhound in some time, but it&#8217;s getting installed right now, thanks man!</p>
<p>no worries.  Not sure what update it was added, but it&#8217;s a pretty tight feature</p>
<p>I hear this everywhere, but my sound hound doesn&#8217;t display this! Is it a country restriction? I do have spotify though,</p>
<p>Not sure, I&#8217;m in the US and have it.  Make sure you have the latest version of SoundHound installed</p>
<p>Might need paid version?</p>
<p>I played with this a bit over the weekend and I found that it works remarkably well. It does seem to identify songs better than Soundhound (which, in turn, I found to identify music better than Shazam quite some time ago), but that&#8217;s the only benefit. The widget takes 4 spaces instead of Soundhounds 1 square, and Soundhound has more features than just being able to identify the song.</p>

<p>The push method looks easier to me.  Or more specifically use Root Explorer to copy the 2 files to their respective directories and then Root Explorer has an pretty idiot proof interface for resetting the permissions.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t work for me. I&#8217;m on a Verizon Galaxy Nexus with stock 4.0.4. I install the apk and it doesn&#8217;t show up in the widgets section at all.</p>
<p>Did you try a reboot? Didn&#8217;t show up for me until after I did</p>
<p>where can I get that wallpaper</p>

<p>All sizes for your downloading pleasure</p>
<p>Thanks Dnomyar!</p>
<p>What Lord 8-Track said.  Where can I get that?</p>
<p>That&#8230;bezel&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;. it&#8217;s HUGE!</p>
<p>Guess it matches the Galaxy Nexus though. :]</p>
<p>&#8220;The bezel around the phone is incredibly thin at only 4.29mm&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/242126/samsung_galaxy_nexus_with_android_40_its_finally_here.html" target="_blank">http://www.pcworld.com/article/242126/samsung_galaxy_nexus_with_android_40_its_finally_here.html</a></p>
<p>Agreed, <em>corylulu</em> doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about. The bezel of G Nex looks big, but it&#8217;s only because of the software buttons.</p>
<p>He was talking about top/bottom bezel of the GNex, I&#8217;m betting.</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s used to a 4:3 ratio.  I own a GNex and a Transormer, the extra length requires a better grip.</p>
<p>It always does.</p>
<p> LOL , I saw what you did there.</p>
<p>Gives more credence that it&#8217;s going to be pretty cheap.</p>
<p>Well, if it had a tiny bezel, it would be quite hard to hold. We all know it&#8217;s going to be cheap, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s going to &#8216;feel&#8217; cheap.</p>
<p>Yeah, the iPad has a fairly large bezel, too. On a touch screen device, you need an area at least as wide as your thumb to hold the front of the device without touching the screen itself.</p>
<p>The iPad&#8217;s bezel is only about the width of my thumb. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>Any narrower and it might be a problem.</p>
<p>Both your comments are valid. Since this is a smaller device than the Ipad but your thumb (and therefor the bezel) is still the same, this looks a lot bigger compared to the iphones bezel. It&#8217;s a usability choice, but one you have to make&#8230;</p>
<p>exactly. narrow bezels always look sexy, but only really work on one hand devices. larger devices need a place for us to put our fingers without gettin&#8217; cheetos dust on the actual viewable space.</p>
<p>It would look better if the bezel was the same width on all sides.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but my Asus TF101 felt pretty cheap. Still does. It still works great. It&#8217;s just, to me, large bezel and a lot of plastic = (or should equal) low price-point.</p>
<p>for $200 you&#8217;re not getting magnesium.</p>
<p>I think that would be pretty much a given.</p>
<p>Holy bezel Batman&#8230;.</p>
<p>First thing I noticed too. Oy.</p>
<p>Yup, me too. Hopefully this gigantic bezel was mostly an ergonomic decision because from an aesthetic perspective it is atrocious.</p>
<p>The black bars above the search bar and in the nav keys make it look worse than it actually I think.  Just a poor background image choice.   Needed more vibrant colors.</p>
<p>WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY DEAR GOD WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.</p>
<p>looked at that and said the exact same thing hahaha</p>
<p>As it should be to escape Apple&#8217;s lawyers as seen recently with the injunction on the GT10.1. The bezel here will give less credence to any lawsuit Apple may pursue.</p>
<p>Even Apple isn&#8217;t crazy enough to go after a 7-inch tablet. At least not for the design.</p>
<p>Remember that this is only a 7&quot; tablet&#8230; it&#8217;s probably a lot smaller than it looks (in this picture) in real life. It would be damn near impossible to hold, otherwise.</p>
<p>The bezel is probably not as big as you think.  There is nothing to measure its scale against in that picture.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what a 7&quot; screen looks like next to something you know the size of:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bUHkj.jpg" /></p>
<p>I remember when everyone thought that the bezel on the Playbook was going to be awkwardly huge. Turns out, it&#8217;s perfect for that size.</p>
<p>Thanks.  People flip out about the bezel, but without it, what the hell are you supposed to hold this thing with.  As a dude with big hands, I feel like even my wifes iPad could use a slightly larger bezel at times.</p>
<p>i feel the same about my ipad. i often accidentally touch the edges of teh screen. gets annyoing when on websites</p>
<p>This is exactly it, I think Apple picked the size of the bezels on the iPad for a reason and other companies came along and slimmed it down without thinking.  The Nexus looks awkward but to hold, this will probably be for the best.</p>
<p>That aside, these last minute leaks are kind of anti-climatic.  I was looking forward to the liveblog.</p>
<p>I said the exact same thing when seeing the image. A bezel that size would find itself at home on almost any KIRF-tablet. It seems you can’t make a small bezel and go for a small price point at the same time.</p>
<p>Holy bezels, Batman!<br />
The bezel on this thing is a turn off</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t believe the first comment is about the appearance of the device, we have come to be so superfluous now a days&#8230;</p>
<p>Um&#8230; superfluous does not mean what you seem to think it means. Perhaps you were looking for &#8220;superficial&#8221;?</p>
<p>What did you expect, that I somehow telepathically knew details around it? Yes, I typed whatever fell on my mind at first. If that&#8217;s superficial, fine by me. At least I had a thought to share. ;)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that bad when you compare to current market items, plus it looks thin.<br />
<img src="http://thedroidguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/nooktab.jpg" /></p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus with steroids.</p>
<p>Yeah it seems that it&#8217;s running the phone version of Android. Weird.</p>
<p>Maybe the tablet interface in 4.1 disappears unnoticed.</p>
<p>Or maybe since it&#8217;s a 7-inch tablet with portrait orientation they decided to go with the smartphone layout rather than the tablet layout for this one.</p>
<p>Tablet UI focused in portrait mode. Seems legit.</p>
<p>Nope,  the phone UI is present even in landscape. F#&amp;k sakes Google, what is this all about?</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/x8oWd.png" /></p>
<p>I think that for 7 inch tablets, it makes sense.  The old UI on a 7 incher was a little weird with those blank spaces at the top and bottom.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a tablet version of the UI? The dock is nothing more than what we&#8217;re already familiar with in iOS with its dock. I would rather have it localized on a dock than having different functions at disparate corners of the screen like in Honeycomb.</p>
<p>The iPad basically runs a phone OS scaled up&#8230;you never know, JellyBean could change up the tablet UI.</p>
<p>I think this interface makes more sense than going all the way up to the upper right for the Apps button</p>
<p>What happened to the tablet UI?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried about this now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not. That dark Honeycomb/Ice Cream Sandwich tablet interface is disgusting; it looks like a 14 year old who just watched the Matrix Trilogy&#8217;s wet dream. I&#8217;m all for a clean, honest UI like that of Chrome OS.</p>
<p>One of the first things that I noticed, too.</p>
<p>Guess everyone was wrong. It&#8217;s a phone instead of tablet.  Galaxy Note big brother.  /s</p>
<p>kind of worrisome. maybe jellybean will feature the ability to switch between the two for large phones/small tablets where its kind of a gray area. ie I love using the tablet UI on my galaxy nexus. I bet there is somebody out there with a 7&quot; tablet wishing things were less cramped and would like the phone UI</p>
<p>Good question&#8230;</p>
<p>How do previous 7&quot; tablets handle the tablet UI?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know. The only 7&quot; tablets I&#8217;ve seen are the Kindle Fire and the Nook Color.  Both of which have a custom UI anyway.</p>
<p>Goggle doesn&#8217;t have creative design team so they copied iOS &#8230; LOL</p>
<p>Huh? It doesn&#8217;t look any different than my Galaxy Tab 8.9 running 4.04&#8230; except the navigation dock is centered instead of left aligned.</p>
<p>The bezel takes up half the damn thing.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip credit.</p>
<p>what&#8217;s the url for the tablet banner?</p>
<p>what&#8217;s the url?</p>

<p>GIF TIME.</p>
<p>the cat&#8217;s shock lasts for so long! love it</p>
<p>Oh goodness&#8230;</p>
<p>The hardware looks ugly to me from this photo.</p>
<p>Well, gotta keep it relative.  What do other $200 &#8211; $250 tablets look like?  Outside of the Kindle, most look like junk.  Nexus is a bit nicer compared to, say, Le Pan and Viewsonic.</p>
<p>Looks sexy. Nice homescreen which should set it part from the junk that has gone before it.</p>
<p>Why is it running the Android phone UI instead of the tablet UI?</p>
<p>Could be Jellybean</p>
<p>Yeah it might be that Google has changed Jelly Bean&#8217;s tablet UI to mimic the Phone UI for ease of use as Android tablets may be complicated for some; or they are just using the phone UI on the Nexus 7 because they want it to be very easy to use just as many consider the Kindle Fire to be in the same respects as a 7 inch tablet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s to the 7th power guys! (mind blown)</p>
<p>so this suppose to compete with surface, ipad and kindle? :S</p>
<p>No, just the Kindle.</p>
<p>I was tempted by all this talk of a nexus tablet until I saw that bezel. You got to be kidding me. Its like the size of the ipad, but with a 7&quot; screen instead, what a waste.</p>
<p>7-inch tablet? Running an OS with almost no tablet-specific app support? No thanks.</p>
<p>The phone apps should work nicely on this though. A lot of the issues come from having too large a screen for the scaling to look nice.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re saying this before I/O. iIn roughly 2 hours, that could all change.</p>
<p>obviously you didn&#8217;t read the live blog.. but they update media apps for JB..</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t change the fact that tablet-specific apps are a serious problem for Android.</p>
<p>Needs a bigger nexus logo.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s same as the one leaked few days ago.. cool</p>
<p>Everyone is always complaining about bezels. With smaller bezels the device would look great, but when you are holding it, the bezel provides a very necessary function so that you are not constantly touching the screen.</p>
<p>As a motorola xoom owner, I can attest to this. That thing is a pain to hold because it has a tiny bezel.</p>
<p>The bezel definitely makes it look bad. Surely manufacturers can do better than this in hardware design. I was expecting something that would look much better than this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be over there, continuing to use my Touchpad with Cyanogenmod 9 thank you very much..</p>
<p>Ugly design and it looks like it&#8217;s running the android phone version. The surface beats this by a mile as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Yeah I agree that the surface is a better tablet, but this isn&#8217;t competing with the surface or iPad it&#8217;s competing with the kindle fire.</p>
<p>nobody even touched the Surface yet, and we are already placing it up there with the iPad in the &#8220;to beat&#8221; category? kind of soon, if you ask me&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah I agree that the surface is a better tablet, but this isn&#8217;t competing with the surface or iPad it&#8217;s competing with the kindle fire.</p>
<p>what do you mean &#8216;running the android phone version?&#8217; ics and jellybean are optimized for BOTH tablets and phones, there is no loner a specific version (i.e. honeycomb)</p>
<p>you know&#8230;kinda like how apple does it? what they need to work on is tablet specific apps. thats what i wanna see</p>
<p>longer. where&#8217;s the damn edit button?</p>
<p>So whats the difference between this and the galaxy note? (excluding screen size)</p>
<p>The Surface is vaporware at this point. At least this tablet has actual specs and a price.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Note seems like a better alternative, if you want to have android on a &#8220;big&#8221; screen.</p>
<p>The bezel will give you more space for holding the device&#8230; my issue is that what if it doesn&#8217;t go Landscape? Its shown portrait and when I flip my GNex landscape on the homescreen it doesn&#8217;t adjust.  Portrait tablet would suck.</p>
<p>Dock connector on the side. Suppose it will turn to landscape as well.</p>
<p>Well now that the device is out, we know this is wrong:<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQxdfQd6tts&t=15m13s" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQxdfQd6tts&amp;t=15m13s</a></p>
<p>MINE</p>
<p>I really like what Duarte&#8217;s done with the icon design but sometimes I think it&#8217;s a reinterpretation of what he started on WebOS</p>
<p>the back doesnt look good and the bezel is way too big!</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s seen the Galaxy S3 in person knows not to judge a device by its initial publicity pics..</p>
<p>Dead on Arrival&#8230;Another tablet fails to beat the iPad!</p>
<p>How do you know that?</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t trying to beat the iPad. It&#8217;s trying to compete with the Kindle Fire.</p>
<p>Do not feed.</p>
<p>I think the bezel looks bigger than it actually is because of the software keyboard</p>
<p>Why would this do any better than any other Android tablet?</p>
<p>The main issue is still very much there, lack of ecosystem.</p>
<p>there could be a bunch of announcements coming.  Sirius just announced its coming to GTV so lets take the wait and see approach</p>
<p>The announcements would have to be thousands of developers saying &#8220;we&#8217;re going to start giving a crap about Android on tablets&#8221;</p>
<p>or they can parade a bunch of big time developers on stage and say X app is coming to Android tablets</p>
<p>i&#8217;ll say this again and again:<br />
i started out with the asus transformer and then switched to the new ipad. the ipad is nice but people exclaim about its ecosystem and its amazing apps. i have yet to find the &#8220;great&#8221; apps. and even found myself missing a lot of the stuff i used on the transformer. ultimately if you&#8217;re established in 1 ecosystem you&#8217;ll prefer it over the other.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s cheap, and it&#8217;s a Nexus.</p>
<p>Is it just my phone apps scaled up? Sure, but I&#8217;m totally cool with that, flipboard, nexflix, the web, all will look sweet with just a bit more screen real estate. And all for less than $299? Sign me up.</p>
<p>Also this reminds me of the Nook for some reason, will probably look better in person</p>
<p>This luks&#8230;&#8230;..weird&#8230;&#8230;..and I am left very confused!</p>
<p>I like how it has a 3 pin pogo connector like the Galaxy Nexus</p>
<p>Hopefully they have a full suite of docks that use that. I&#8217;m hoping for a car dock.</p>
<p>Ugly. Because bezel. Very disappoint.</p>
<p>No Google Logo on the back? Just the freakishly huge Nexus and Asus?</p>
<p>And the Nexus Logo is different</p>
<p>If this is the Nexus tablet Google&#8217;s got, I&#8217;m turning to Microsoft to start the tablet competition.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see the point of this device. To me it just seems to be another Android device that most people won&#8217;t want. What does this bring to the table that other Android tablets haven&#8217;t in the past? At least with the Surface, it&#8217;s something new, something fresh, something that we haven&#8217;t really seen before. I just can&#8217;t see this gaining much traction, outside of users like us, Verge readers.</p>
<p>Inexpensive, good hardware, will get all the latest development, and inexpensive.  Personally, it&#8217;s the tablet I&#8217;ve been waiting for &#8211; no ridiculous $500 + a 2 year contract, just good solid Android device that&#8217;s bigger than my phone &#8211; good for traveling and chilling on the couch and relatively future proof.  Dunno if anyone else thinks like I do, but I&#8217;m getting one the moment they drop&#8230;if they&#8217;re really $199/$250.</p>
<blockquote> What does this bring to the table that other Android tablets haven’t in the past?</blockquote>
<p>High resolution screen (215 dpi &#8211; iPad retina is 264 dpi).  Tegra 3.  Jelly Bean (even ICS was rare on 7&quot; tablets).  Updates from Google.  $200.</p>
<p>And I can buy three of these for every $600 Surface.</p>
<p>Looks like a giant phone.</p>
<p>The Chrome Icon is here, and the &#8220;browser&#8221; icon is gone, sweet!</p>
<p>Nexus designs have always been ugly round star trek looking things. This actually looks nice save the top and bottom bezel.</p>
<p>That bezel is pretty dastardly. What did you expect for 199.00 if thats the actual cost. Its gonna be a gapps approved version of a chinese tablet.</p>
<p>Why use the phone UI (with an apparently larger dock)? Interesting design choice. I guess they figured that it was small enough that the tablet UI wouldn&#8217;t be necessary. Personally, I like the unified status bar.</p>
<p>Another thing, does this mean we won&#8217;t get the tablet UI for some of the apps (like Gmail)? That would kind of suck&#8230;I actually like the tablet version of Gmail.</p>
<p>Big bezels are good for tablets. It&#8217;s how you hold them without unintended screen inputs.</p>
<p>Welcome to reality, by the way. You&#8217;ll like it here.</p>
<p>Hmm, ok, I&#8217;ll wait for Surface then.</p>
<p>IMHO, the unified UI is going in the right direction, if this is correct. It&#8217;s confusing to have a menu, status bar in different area.</p>
<p>The bezel is actually too thin on the sides in portrait view &#8230; how are you supposed to hold it?</p>
<p>Looks similar to the recent UI design changes in Chrome OS.</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Chrome_OS_21.0.1172_Aura_Dev.png" /></p>
<p>i just think 7 inches is too damn small. &#8220;thats what she said&#8221;. Seriously, every 7 inch tablets i&#8217;ve used is kind of annoying. 10 is too big for portability. 8.5 would be the sweet spot for me, dual booting android and ios would be nice while i&#8217;m still dreaming.</p>
<p>rofl love the &#8220;that&#8217;s what she said&#8221; preemptive strike! :D :D : D</p>
<p>The URL if anyone&#8217;s interested: <a href="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market_images/hardware/nexus_7_banner_001.png" target="_blank">https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market_images/hardware/nexus_7_banner_001.png</a></p>
<p>It has the dock connector similar too the Galaxy Nexus. Should primarily work in landscape mode then.</p>
<p>why is the camera on the short side then and why is the promo picture in portrait?</p>
<p>Designed for animals!</p>
<p>Do I see a replacement for Chrome OS?</p>
<p>If its that, im disappointed. Instead of using their traditional tablet UI, why do they use an extended phone one? It looks ugly, same thing Apple did with iPad. 4 icons and really huge space between them. Ugly as hell.</p>
<p>You will probably be able to customise the hell out of it.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the live video from I/O conference. <br />
<a href="https://developers.google.com/events/io/" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/events/io/</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll know everything about it in 20 minutes anyway.</p>
<p>Guys&#8230; why does that look like the phone version of Android?</p>
<p>7 inch is like a big phone&#8230; Seems useless to me since you cant put it in your pocket, so why would you want a 7 inch in your bag if you can have a 10 inch.</p>
<p>Easier to read books with.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s what she&#8230;</p>
<p>That is NOT the tablet version of the UI, but rather a modified version of the phone variant applied to a tablet?  WTF?  It looks like they took the phone version of the UI and added 2 extra columns and grey-scaled the search bar.  I take this to imply that the home screen is visible only in portrait mode (as it is on the Galaxy Nexus).</p>
<p>Hmmmm&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to feel about this, since I much prefer the existing layout of the Tablet UI for these kinds of devices, since it integrates the notification bar and the navigation bar into a single bar, which intrudes less on the available screen space.  That plus it adjusts itself to landscape mode as well.</p>
<p>If this ends up being portrait only, I smell launcher replacement.</p>
<p>Did you just post this on Google+? I think I just read it.</p>
<p>the nook has better industrial design. Thats sad.</p>
<p>So&#8230; If Google whant to launch Phone OS on this device, tablet-specific apps for Android will sink into oblivion. Finally</p>
<p>monstrous bezel&#8230;</p>
<p>Please look at Michael Scrip&#8217;s post above.</p>
<p>i did &#8211; still too big :(</p>
<p>BOOM &#8211; <a href="https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market_images/hardware/nexus_7_banner_001.png" target="_blank">https://ssl.gstatic.com/android/market_images/hardware/nexus_7_banner_001.png</a></p>
<p>Looks like Macbook&#8230; in tablet form.</p>
<p>Uhh yeah that&#8217;s disgusting</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be watching to see if whatever Google reveals is close to a Microsoft Surface tablet. Regarding looks and build that is. We still don&#8217;t have pricing availability for the Surface yet.</p>
<p>very similar to the htc flyer :s i dunno what they were thinking when they made that &#8230;</p>
<p>If you watch this video of the Nexus Q the &#8220;rendered&#8221; tablet has the same exact layout.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F5FO-MyR0o&feature=player_embedded" target="new"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F5FO-MyR0o&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F5FO-MyR0o&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>
<p>Chome no longer says Chome Beta</p>
<p>Meh, it doesn&#8217;t look bad, but it&#8217;s not eyepoppingly good at the same time. It think tablets &#8220;looks&#8221; are a little over emphasized anyway, it&#8217;s a slab with a screen on it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning on getting one if (and only if) it has GPS. Android support should be on par with any other Nexus device, which is why this is a big deal in the first place, has nothing to do with the device itself.</p>
<p>Still need to know why this has the phone UI</p>
<p>It looks real cheap..Kindle Fire is much better..and Amazon is going to even release a new version, this month end.</p>
<p>i bet the oem&#8217;s are pretty pissed about getting their legs cut off if this thing is $199.</p>
<p>Not at all.  This is nvidias reference design which is supposed to cost 199, so other OEM&#8217;s can meet this price point by following that reference and essentially make the same tablet.</p>
<p>Did the Galaxy Nexus HSPA+ just drop in price?  I swear it was $399 yesterday.  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa</a></p>
<p>It still says $399&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m staring at the page right now and it says $349.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Blame Game by Kanye, specifically Chris Rock&#8217;s part<br />
&#8220;Dude, with the bezel!?!&#8221;</p>
<p>Winner winner, chicken dinner?</p>
<p>Introducing Nexus 7 with Android Jelly Bean video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YMQdfGFK5XQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=YMQdfGFK5XQ</a></p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>WTF?! Google really like to list products way before they area actually announced.</p>
<p><strong>are</strong></p>
<p>Wow, where have I seen this video before.</p>
<p>Oh wait, vid just went private :(</p>
<p>4.1 better be good. They took all year to do a .1 update?</p>
<p>Well it has been a little over 8 months since ICS was released and it is on so few devices. 4.1 will probably take just as long to trickle down to comparable number of existing devices. So at least this is a .x update that few people will get to use.</p>
<p>I think for a 7 inch tablet, which would be in portrait mode primarily, the phone UI makes sense.  Although, I hope they don&#8217;t do the same thing for a 10 inch tablet.</p>
<p>So it looks like what we thought it would look like, has amazing specs, and features an updated OS that none of us have used&#8230;no surprises&#8230;cept now everybody hates it&#8230;ridiculously and clueless and fickle much, Verge forum members?</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb</a><br />
$199/8GB; $249/16GB</p>
<p>Wow, GPS! That will pair nicely with the forthcoming offline Google Maps.</p>
<p>The video just went private. :\</p>
<p>You know those nauseating Apple adverts where they talk like they&#8217;re saving the world, with light music in the background. It was that, but with a different logo at the end.</p>
<p>I really hope they up their game like Microsoft did. I&#8217;m sick of Apple not having to fight to own the market.</p>
<p>God damn it, release it in the poxy UK already.</p>
<p>I think I am going to order one</p>
<p>So do they charge you now, or when it ships?</p>
<p>Oh god forgot it, with a bezel like that?!</p>
<p>Initial thoughts. The device itself look ok but lacks any wow factor. Specs are fine. The decision to use phone UI is a bit weird although it probably works fine for 7&quot; form factor tablets. Finally only FFC, that&#8217;s a good thing even if motivated by cost cutting.</p>
<p>Seems to be targeting Amazon Fire in an effort to grow market share numbers for Android tablets as opposed to targeting higher end tablets. Not sure this is a wise decision since they are essentially handing over high end to Apple/MS for another year or two.</p>
<p>Also, position of FFC seems to suggest that portrait orientation as primary orientation for device use. On top of phone UI &#8230; makes it seem rather odd.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a mirror for the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCnt__Qh95I" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCnt__Qh95I</a></p>
<p>Edge to edge display? Sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, the tablet interface I&#8217;ve been hoping for.</p>
<p>Hey, how come that white GNex with the Nexus 7 in the second photo got white bezel? The white versions I&#8217;ve seen so far only got white rim and back cover. That looks pretty.</p>
<p>Any word on whether it&#8217;ll have a MicroSD slot or some other kind of expansion?</p>
<p>I also want to know.  Will be very annoyed if it doesn&#8217;t &#8230; if I want artificially limited hardware, I&#8217;d buy Apple &#8230;</p>
<p>OKOK, Great! Now bring this to Japan! (And do not make it like twice more expensive only because we have Gundam and Sushi!)</p>
<p>This or the kindle fire 2?</p>
<p>i just ordered mine!</p>
<p>Looks good but there&#8217;s no external memory slot.</p>
<p>I was so excited about this tablet, bezel and all&#8230;until I found out that there is no expandable storage.  That is a dealbreaker as far as I am concerned, so I won&#8217;t be buying this tablet.  I am not quite ready to &#8220;trust the cloud&#8221; as, imo the cloud hasn&#8217;t shown itself to be entirely trustworthy &#8211; yet.  I really believe Google should be about maximizing options, instead of minimizing them.  Just because Apple doesn&#8217;t believe in expandable storage doesn&#8217;t mean that Google should meekly follow that approach.  I&#8217;m disappointed.  I really like the 7 inch form factor.  It is just so easy to carry around everywhere.  I am definitely ready to upgrade my Nook Color, so I guess I&#8217;ll be shopping for a Nook Tablet or the Samsung Galaxy 7.</p>
<p>The fact that it doesn&#8217;t have a microSD slot just killed it for me, too. Which is probably why I&#8217;m not really interested in the  Fire very  much. I thought about the Nook, but would rather have a less locked down device.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s is also why I had zero interest in the Kindle Fire. I do have a way of accessing the entire Google system with the Nook, however.   I found a proprietary micro sd card issued by a company called N2A.  Using a Cyanogen Mod rom, the card contains a bootable flash of the Gingerbread OS.  By inserting that card into the slot of the Nook, I have access to the entire Google ecosystem.  The card comes in 8, 16 and 32gb sizes.  It gives you the beauty of a dual boot system because the card doesn&#8217;t alter the native OS of the Nook.  That&#8217;s the good news.  The bad news is that the card is partitioned, with most of the space allocated for &#8220;data.&#8221;:  So that will limit the number and size of apps that you can add from Google.  I got the card through Amazon,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering what people with a Galaxy Note will do.  Can you make a case for a 7 inch tablet if your current screen is 5.3 inches and runs a similar OS?  I&#8217;d be curious to hear if anyone is in that situation..</p>
<p>So could be 3 months from now even? Why expand the RAM on US version to 2 GB if the update is taking forever?</p>
<p>All LTE versions of the S3 have 2GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Obvious comment is obvious.</p>
<p>He (or she) is saying that Samsung wanted 2GB in all of the phones so they would def. be upgradable to Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean can run on 1GB of RAM with ease. I was simply stating that Samsung just made all LTE versions 2GB, don&#8217;t know why.</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s saying that Samsung made all LTE versions with 2GB of RAM because they were hoping they weren&#8217;t behind in minimum specs when JB requirements were released.</p>
<p>Ah maybe. But then why was the main model of the GS3 only have 1GB of RAM?</p>
<p>But then the LTE versions came out later.</p>
<p>Main gs3= quad core chip&#8230;U.s=dual core chip. Extra ram helps offset the difference because of course were not just running android, were running an overlay that&#8217;s heavily mofified . Extra ram helps jeep experience smooth.</p>
<p>The GT-I9305[T] supports international LTE bands, and has the Quad Core Exynos plus 2GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Yeah I remember that model, that wasn&#8217;t the original gs3 tho. But still they all should&#8217;ve had 2gb anyhow. When I&#8217;m using my phone and swapping though all my apps, and check the ram usage, I&#8217;m never under 1gb. So irk how ppl with the 1gb version of the gs3 are faring. Especially in the future with further os updates to android  requiring more space</p>
<p>I have a HTC One X which only has 1GB of RAM, and I have never hit the RAM limit. Linux is very good at memory management, and some RAM counters include cached memory as used memory, which it is used but free.</p>
<p>Ahhh OK. So maybe Samsung counter is counting that cached memory. Im not sure, but if our phones are getting by all is well.  I think its just a me thing, I constantly clear cache and apps for some odd reason.</p>
<p>Never use a task manager, Linux is much better at managing memory then you are.</p>
<p>Just when you thought you knew it all. I don&#8217;t use the ones from the app market but I use the one that Samsung includes with touchwiz. Smh guess i was wrong. Thank a lot for that tip</p>
<p>I used to try all kinds of task managers back when I had captivate running stock rom. Then I educated myself to learning more about android and how linux works (and ofcourse custom roms :) I don&#8217;t use them not even the built in that comes prepacked with Touchwiz</p>
<p>Yep :).</p>
<p>I have a One XL and a friend has the AT&amp;T GS3.  The S3 multitasks MUCH better than my One X.  Apps he used days ago on his S3 are in the state he left them.  I can&#8217;t switch back and forth between a draft email and the browser without having to find the draft in the draft folder and reopening it for editing.  On my friend&#8217;s S3 (w/ 2 gb ram) he switches back and forth with ease and the draft email never closes.  He goes below 1GB RAM available.</p>
<p>Support for the S4 Krait in the One XL and LTE S3 needs more ram than the Tegra 3 in the international versions of these two phones.</p>
<p>HTC has some unique min free settings in the One XL&#8230; there&#8217;s an article about this on android central.</p>
<p>I usually pick up and play with my wife&#8217;s HOX and let me tell that it sucks &#8230; lol. Screen transitions are jittery and its just not smooth overall. I don&#8217;t know if you have yours as stock and no custom rom. <br />
However I do love the camera app and screen on it &#8230;</p>
<p>With Sense 4.1 and CM10 on my HOX, everything is smooth. With Sense 4+ everything is buttery smooth.</p>
<p>Nexus S runs JB with a single-core 1 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM. It&#8217;s probably not as smooth as on more recent devices, but it&#8217;s smoother than the previous Android versions on the same device. JB is supposed to be smoother than ICS regardless of specs.</p>
<p>Samsung has gone on the record as saying the extra ram was because they didn&#8217;t know the hardware requirements for JB. Keep in mind Samsung is also aware of that US carriers put more software on their phones than the Euro variants</p>
<p>And a few months later Google announced JB and said that everything that runs ICS can run JB. They should talk more.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the problem is with 2GB.  Having extra RAM always helps enhance the phone&#8217;s performance. Also, our LTE S3 uses Snapdragon S4 plus, which has a  relatively weaker graphic processor.  Extra RAM were used to offset the difference of spec on paper.  That&#8217;s how I see the reason of 2GB RAM. I don&#8217;t buy what Samsung said that they didn&#8217;t the min requirement of JB when the international version only has 1GB.</p>
<p>Another thing is having extra RAM is not the reason that carriers delay to push out the update. They are just busy to put on their crap-ware and to make sure you cannot screw them over on the network like disabling network switch,  the quick access to tethering&#8230;&#8230; etc.</p>
<p>Basically,  what Samsung said here contains no useful information: no solid date, no current status. They just try to calm the crowds down.  That pissed me off. What do you mean by &#8220;months&#8221; ?? 2 months, 3 months, another 6 months?? Compared to the international version that runs JB already, the north american carriers are just ridiculous! Luckily, I rooted my phone already and flashed in the super stable CM10. I don&#8217;t give it a damn.!</p>
<p>Then you&#8217;ll have to wait for each carrier to fuck the update up before it finally reaches your phone.</p>
<p>Right, it&#8217;ll take Verizon 3 months to certify the bloat.</p>
<p>At least there have been two minor updates to the Verizon GS3 so far. The poor Vzw Gnex went over 6 months before getting any kind of maintenance or bug fixes and was plagued with hardcore issues in comparison to the GS3. I think that Verizon won&#8217;t be as bad this time around considering the success of the phone. Verizon seems to push out updates quicker to their better selling phones.</p>
<p>Then they&#8217;ll temporarily pull the update once issued because they fucked something up.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>I swear they said that a couple months ago&#8230;</p>
<p>6 months is way too long.</p>
<p>When I got my GS3, I told myself I wasn&#8217;t going to root it like I did my Incredible.  I said it&#8217;s powerful enough and it works well enough that I will be able to wait for JB.  With each passing day I&#8217;m finding that harder to wait for.  I honestly didn&#8217;t think it would take Samsung/Verizon (or your US carrier of choice) over 6 months to make the update available. Obviously I should have known better and the worst part is knowing now that we may never even see an update to 4.2 (or whatever Key Lime is going to be). Sorry for the pessimism.</p>
<p>I got my VZW Galaxy Nexus back in February. I figured that since it was a Nexus, even if certain updates were delayed by a few weeks, I could deal with it.</p>
<p>I made it til April, and when JellyBean was announced, I was so glad I rooted. I had JB months before Verizon made their &#8220;official&#8221; version.</p>
<p>Such a dilution of the Nexus brand.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly&#8230;.I really didn&#8217;t want to start rooting again (it&#8217;s a disease)&#8230;.but this is ridiculous.  Any input on what a good JB rom is for the Verizon S3?</p>
<p>I have T-Mobile, but LiquidSmooth is a fantastic ROM in my opinion with almost any feature you can ask for (<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1831649" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1831649</a>) and the CM nightlies are pretty solid at this point.</p>
<p>I still love TouchWiz-based ROMs because they seem to give me better battery life and have fewer bugs. I have been running <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1792499" target="new">Team Synergy&#8217;s</a> JB beta 0.2 for a month or so and it has performed very well, IMO. Their r73 ICS release is also very stable and performs well.</p>
<p>My bet is 3 months after the note 2 is released. Though id rather have google wallet than JB.</p>
<p>Should&#8217;ve switched to sprint then.  I&#8217;ve had Google Wallet since the Galaxy S3 came out.</p>
<p>nothings worse than sprint&#8217;s 3G data speeds. Edge/2G is faster on ATT&#8230;</p>
<p>In your area buddy. I have never heard these terrible speeds that everyone else talks about. But the Sprint Variant is definitely better than VZN. Verizon bloats and delays, Sprint allows you to delete completely and pushes out the update. The fact that the Galaxy Nexus came out for VZN first and the Sprint Nexus got the update first is ridiculous. VZN, i dont hate them but they have no competition so they are making the best of it, trust</p>
<p>Summary: All American networks are shit.</p>
<p>T-mobile has the best international texting plan for my family so I&#8217;m sticking with Magenta. Ive tried Verizon and our sms and mms never made it to my fam overseas since Sprint uses similar tech I asume I&#8217;d continue having the same issue.</p>
<p>Ah yes, the good ol&#8217; in the coming months promise. I remember hearing that from Palm back in 2010.</p>
<p>I remember hearing it from Samsung about this same phone and OS version not long ago.</p>
<p>I remember it for my Galaxy S, hearing about it on the Galaxy S 2 and now the Galaxy S 3.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested in seeing a list of all the Samsung phones released in the U.S. last year on any major carrier and having it show what the phone released with as an OS and what it&#8217;s currently on as an OS.</p>
<p>Seems Samsung has gotten better though but the carriers just slow things down even worse.</p>
<p>Would it be illegal for the Android OEMs to band together and try and strike an update deal similar to Apple?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how this would be practical. They use different interface enhancements.</p>
<p>I mean all Andorid OEM go to the carriers individually and say let us handle the updates or no Android phones for you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s called buying your phone unlocked.</p>
<p>I know in the UK its not bad, delays are only a week or so.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been only one option in the last year (GNex) on 2 carriers to make that work.  Not enough choices of unlocked top tier phones in the US yet to make this a real option.  Especially with there being 0 options for Verizon.</p>
<p>Well then that&#8217;s your regulators fault for not allowing freedom to the consumer.</p>
<p>And guess who voted for those regulators? The people. Like I said, people here love and demand carrier controlled phones.</p>
<p>Never going to happen. Motorola/google <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/16/3513860/motorola-stock-android-customization-verizon">can&#8217;t even stand up to Big Red.</a></p>
<p>Well I assume there are agreements in place for the previous management that they can&#8217;t just cancel on Verizon.  I&#8217;m sure their goal to shipped stock devices on Verizon isn&#8217;t dead, it&#8217;s just something thats going to take time.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to happen is Google/Moto no longer participating in DROID branding and those agreements may not expire soon.</p>
<p>That article has flaws because the Razr i has no operator lock (unless you buy it subsidized), yet has the same MotoBlur.</p>
<p>The Razr i has also been in development for long enough that it would&#8217;ve been before Motorola was really influenced by Google. Wait a year and if this is still happening, then we&#8217;ll know whether Motorola was just lying or not.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why would the OEMs do that? How do you think they make money? By selling NEW phones. They don&#8217;t make money by updating your old phone. Besides, their customers are not you, they are the carriers. And how do carriers make money? By tenticing you to extend your contract with new phones, not by updating older phones.</p>
<p>This is the same story every single year. Why would anyone be surprised?</p>
<p>Their customers are also retailers such as Amazon and phone shops. I brought my HTC One X from Amazon, my friend brought one from Three (an operator). Both got updates at around about the same time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an expert, but I suspect that this would be illegal. It&#8217;s exactly what got Apple and the major book publishers in trouble when they went to the agency model. There was nothing illegal about choosing the agency model; what was illegal was the publishers banding together and doing it en masse. This happened because none of the individual publishers felt strong enough to stand up to Amazon on its own (if the other publishers didn&#8217;t back them up, the individual publisher would be screwed and would have to crawl back to Amazon on hands-and-knees).</p>
<p>Android OEMs are in the same state. The carriers can easily play one OEM against the other. The only OEM with enough clout to stand up to the carriers individually is Samsung, which is why the Galaxy S3 is being sold relatively unmodified on all carriers.</p>
<p>That is just merciless.</p>
<p>No kidding&#8230; this is getting out of hand.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s getting out of hand? LOL. It&#8217;s the exact same story EVERY YEAR. The late GB updates to Froyo Galaxy S phones. The late ICS update to Galaxy S2 phones. Now this. How many times do people want to be fooled again and again? Hilarious.</p>
<p>But its their flagship with the super core proccesors/s</p>
<p>It&#8217;s October already, so in coming months could mean 2013. Oh well, that&#8217;s what you get for buying carrier controlled phones. It&#8217;s the same story every single time, yet people keep buying them.</p>
<p>If Google can deliver multiple Nexus phones at different price points then the people who care about this (like myself) will actually have an option.</p>
<p>Keep in mind most SG3 owners don&#8217;t know what JB is.</p>
<p>Why do people defend this behaviour?</p>
<p>Does not help that the US models are not standardised.</p>
<p>There have sprint JB leaks that have been running pretty flawlessly on my phone.</p>
<p>T-mobile adds wifi calling. That is one piece of carrier &#8220;bloat&#8221; I&#8217;m more than happy to have. Being able to sms or call in this office when nobody else can is awesome.</p>
<p>US carriers should be ashamed of themselves&#8230;morons now need months to test and push the update.</p>
<p>Yet people love and demand carrier controlled phones. So who&#8217;s actually at fault?</p>
<p>Who &#8220;loves and demands&#8221; carrier controlled phones?</p>
<p>Practically everyone who don&#8217;t want to shell out $600 on a phone&#8230;.I did though&#8230;but that still did not free me from bloatware &amp; control.</p>
<p>Sure, people like getting a subsidy, but conflating that with &#8220;love and demand&#8221; for the carrier controlled system is overstating the case a bit.</p>
<p>Agree. &#8220;Love&#8221; defiantly not and &#8220;Demand&#8221; subsidy not control ( I call it <strong>conTROLL</strong>)</p>
<p>And yet what do we have? Carrier controlled phones, and people keep buying them en-masse. Funny isn&#8217;t it. Why would people spend their hard-earned money on these if that&#8217;s not what they loved/demanded?</p>
<p>People here and most US consumers. Want proof? Just go to any threads about provider locking and see how many people defending it. You&#8217;ll be amazed.</p>
<p>Wow that&#8217;s news for me&#8230;.people really defend that&#8230;gosh &#8217;merica!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen this kind of crap.</p>
<p>&#8220;in the coming months&#8221; .. WTF?!</p>
<p>Translation? &#8220;Next year&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Translation: &#8220;Today, we need to let you know about some tough choices related to the decision not to update the Galaxy S III to Android 4.1 Jellybean. We will continue to support the Galaxy S III with maintenance releases to ensure optimum performance for the consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translation: You might as well root your phone now. :p</p>
<p>With rumors of the next Nexus phones shipping with Android 4.2, I&#8217;m sure 4.1 is what consumers will want at time of release. </p>
<p>According to the apologists, most people don&#8217;t know what JB is anyway, so no problem, right?</p>
<p>Get a Samsung, they said. The next big thing is already here, they said.</p>
<p>Sent from my iPhone</p>
<p>you got Jelly Bean on your iPhone already?</p>
<p>I have even better than that. It&#8217;s called iOS.</p>
<p>With the glacial pace of Android updates, you are more likely to get Jelly Bean on an iPhone before an average Android user gets it.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;coming months&#8221;? Knowing Samsung, that must mean February. 2014.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t Samsungs fault, the GT-I9305[T] and GT-I9300[T] are already receiving Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>Consumers don&#8217;t care who&#8217;s fault it is.</p>
<p>In that sense they dont even care about an upgrade&#8230;we are talking tech crowd here and we all know how useless the carriers are and the biggest reason for upgrade fails.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t 4.2 or 5.0 be released next month?</p>
<p>This is quite embarrassing for a &#8216;top of the line&#8217; handset.</p>
<p>Why is it &#8220;embarrassing&#8221; now? It&#8217;s the same story every year (late GB update for Froyo Galaxy S phones, late ICS update for the S2). People complain, but then they will buy whatever new Samsung phone next year, and then complain again. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>True, the masses really don&#8217;t care what OS version they&#8217;re on. Many don&#8217;t even care what OS there on at all.</p>
<p>Masses &gt; Opinion and gripes of those who frequent The Verge.</p>
<p>There seem to be a lot of people on The Verge who exhibit this behaviour as well.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>So I can&#8217;t care about my phone getting updated because my mum doesn&#8217;t care?</p>
<p>No, they are saying it&#8217;s not really &#8220;embarrassing&#8221; because most people don&#8217;t care. It is disappointing, though.</p>
<p>This. </p>
<p>Same story every year. Carrier locked phones will always be the last to get updates. As much as I love to flash CM10 and call it a day, I&#8217;d rather have to worry about doing that anymore. I&#8217;m very much tempted to just dump my Verizon GSIII, unlimited data, and then go for an unlocked GSM Nexus (more than likely the one coming up). But that LTE speed is just too great to give up.</p>
<p>that is, I&#8217;d rather <strong>note</strong> have to worry about flashing custom ROMs*</p>
<p><strong>*NOT</strong> grrr, I swear I looked at twice before posting.</p>
<p>The way this headline makes US GS3 react (like me).<br />
<blockquote>Samsung confirms US Galaxy S III handsets will get Android 4.1</blockquote><br />
( °_°)</p>
<blockquote>&#8216;in the coming months&#8217;</blockquote>
<p>（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻┻</p>
<p>To make it worse, I&#8217;m on Verizon, so I know I&#8217;m screwed.</p>
<p>So they said the same thing that they have been saying since the:</p>
<p>Galaxy came out in 2009</p>
<p>Galaxy S1 in 2010</p>
<p>Galaxy S2 in 2011</p>
<p>Galaxy S3 now in 2012???</p>
<p>Its not really Samsung but the carriers. The update is already there, however they can&#8217;t give details because it needs carrier certification. Which is why everyone on Verizon who has a 2 year contract is about to get an upgrade by the time that update gets to them. Everyone else doesnt have to worry so much.</p>
<p>This is why every Android phone needs stock.</p>
<p>GS1-Eclair,  Froyo,  Gingerbread. <br />
GS2-Gingerbread, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean (roms are leaking already) <br />
GS3-Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean (Europe has already got it)</p>
<p>What about the Galaxy? Also you forgot the fact that when they did get them it was many months later, in the US at least.</p>
<p>Everything you said doesn&#8217;t change the fact that they always say the same thing over and over and there is still a chance that you might not get it before you finally decide to just upgrade to the next model. This also goes for the other OEMs.</p>
<p>personally, I don&#8217;t care about what the US gets, i don&#8217;t live there :-)</p>
<p>this shit happens with 4 incompatible networks</p>
<blockquote>i don’t live there :-)</blockquote>
<p>WAT? There are places outside of the US???? /s</p>
<p>CM10 anyone?</p>
<p>If by anyone, you mean the 1% of rooted Android users then of course.</p>
<p>My Galaxy S3 was my frst foray into the world of Android. Now that I&#8217;m more knowledgable about the OS there&#8217;s no way my next Android phone isn&#8217;t an unlocked nexus. I love my S3 but waiting months for an OS update is maddening.</p>
<p>Root your phone and install JB problem solved.</p>
<p>Yeah bt you shouldn&#8217;t have to root your phon to get the latest update. That&#8217;s the issue!</p>
<p>What a stupid and complicated solution for 99% of users. Most people don&#8217;t know how or don&#8217;t want to mess up their phone on accident. I have rooted many different Android phones but now so that I don&#8217;t have to waste my time I tell everyone to buy a Nexus.</p>
<p>And most people don&#8217;t even know what iOS or Android is or what OS they have or even that their phone might get updated someday.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe that Samsung and the carriers are still playing this old and tired game.  I really thought that we would have JB by now.</p>
<p>This is Samsungs best selling phone and cannot believe that I may have to wait possibly until next year to get JB.  I mean what exactly do these carriers need to test that takes so damn long? I really don&#8217;t get it. I mean carriers would never pull this crap with Apple, yet Android based phonse sell more units.</p>
<p>I really dig my SIII but I agree with some of the other posters. I&#8217;m getting sick of waiting 6 months for the latest update.</p>
<p>Next time around I&#8217;m going with a Nexus.</p>
<blockquote>This is Samsungs best selling phone and cannot believe that I may have to wait possibly until next year to get JB.</blockquote>
<p>Yes it is, but they have already started shipping JB updates to GS3s worldwide (only the GT-I9300 afaik).</p>
<blockquote>This is Samsungs best selling phone and cannot believe that I may have to wait possibly until next year to get (<strong>insert Android update name</strong>)</blockquote>
<p>You don&#8217;t how many times I have read this exact comment over the years. Everyone is always saying that there is no way in hell that (<strong>insert OEM</strong>) is not going to support (<strong>insert phone</strong>) because it is their<strong> &#8220;Flagship&#8221; </strong>device.</p>
<p>are you claiming Samsung isn&#8217;t supporting their phone?</p>
<p>They support it (eventually)but not like Apple or Google does and that is what everyone wants. I am sure that I have read that comment above a few thousand times.</p>
<p>Update? LOL what a joke. JB have been out for ages already and it still isin&#8217;t out. How pathetic.</p>
<p>Must be sucky to be Android user.</p>
<p>Twisting the knife when you&#8217;ve already  been stabbed in the back  is not very classy.</p>
<p>Only in the US. The Europe already has the update.</p>
<p>The Europe eh?</p>
<p>Heard of the UK, but never the Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ages&#8221;?</p>
<p>When the top phones take months to get updates, and marginal phones never receive an update&#8230; the system is broken.</p>
<p>When Google noticed this in 2009 they created the Nexus.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t an issue in 2009 when there were just a handful of Android phones on the market.</p>
<p>People were complaining about the second and fourth Android phones not getting updates on time in 2009. They were the Samsung Galaxy and HTC Hero. The only difference is that they were all considered top phones since like you said there were only a hand full.</p>
<p>Not good enough.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s bull shit like this that made me switch to the iPhone 5</p>
<p>you got Jelly Bean already?</p>
<p>Samsung failing to deliver again&#8230;</p>
<p>Samsung has already delivered,.</p>
<p>The carriers are effin everyone over.</p>
<p>Well I dont care about the update. Im already running jellybean with perfect performance and no issues with CM10. Its now the nexus that I always dreamed of. Carriers keep your carrier iq uptates to your selves.</p>
<p>This is why I will never buy a carrier-branded/locked phone again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to say than do in the US. Even most of the unsubsidized phones are carrier locked. There are very few exceptions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the US, and I found it pretty easy. It costs a bit more in the short term but I think it&#8217;s worth it. Not as quite as easy or cheap as getting a phone subsidized on contract, admittedly, and it&#8217;s not for everyone, but it is very doable.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s software has gotten better but they need to seriously stop using cheap ass plastic on their phones. The GS1 was plastic, yet solid. The GS3 feels like you&#8217;re going to break it when you use it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never felt like I was going to break my GS3. It feels sturdier and nicer than my Atrix did.</p>
<p>well if drops correct angle it wil , its physics. bigger screen easier to break even if was made from titanium.</p>
<p>samsung do have good build quality and metal would add weight making easier to break the screen</p>
<p>i have more than month with it already.</p>
<p>Why use two weasel words (&#8220;might be nearing&#8221;) to try and put some positive spin on this?  It&#8217;s already been, literally, months since the patch was coming &#8220;very soon&#8221;.   Meanwhile my wife&#8217;s 3 year old 3GS received an update last month.  Why is Apple able to patch their phones without AT&amp;T, Verizon et al signing off but Samsung can&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Thank you based god.</p>
<p>Wait, what about the screen?</p>
<p>I thought the screen was already beautiful?</p>
<p>I expect a lot phones to hit eBay soon</p>
<p>I would be livid if I bought an HTC One X any time recently.</p>
<p>I bought one X in may and I&#8217;m fine with this as thus isnt coming to my carrier,  att</p>
<p>Uh. I guess I was wrong. They are releasing it on att. Shit.</p>
<p>It says LTE centric markets but doesn&#8217;t single out att &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t imagine att getting this. Hopefully I&#8217;m wrong because it&#8217;s a great phone and there should be more people aware of it but by no means am I feeling f*cked over by owning the One X.</p>
<p>Presumably you&#8217;ve been happy enough with your phone as it is, how does this change anything?</p>
<p>Rational thoughts will get you nowhere.</p>
<p>But what about their &#8220;releasing one phone per year&#8221; promise?<br />
The whole idea was to release one phone per year so that they could serve the updates better.</p>
<p>This line of reasoning makes no sense.  You&#8217;re fine with a better product than yours existing as long as you couldn&#8217;t conceivably use it due to your contract?  Really?</p>
<p>The same rule applies to all phones. Even the almighty iPhone.</p>
<p>There is always a phone on the horizon&#8230;</p>
<p>True, but for those that are Apple loyal till the end, they can rest assured that &#8220;the next best thing&#8221; won&#8217;t come for a year. I&#8217;m by no means an Apple faithful, but they don&#8217;t have to worry about a new phone coming out to one up theirs in 3-6 months. The Razr Maxx comes to mind&#8230;</p>
<p>To be fair, the Droid RAZR Maxx did have a bigger battery, but it was also much thicker.  Hence kind of failing its name.  And that was really the only change they made.</p>
<p>I have, and I&#8217;m not. The battery life is great for my usage (heavy, all day) and I&#8217;m getting the software updates. I wish I had the extra storage though, although the dropbox deal helps. I seriously doubt at&amp;t will get this anyway.</p>
<p>Y&#8217;know what has a nice screen? The Lumia 920.</p>
<p>You know what has a nice camera? Lumia 920.</p>
<p>You know what is annoying? Lumia 920 comments.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>MS astroturfers annoying habit of inserting the Lumia 920 reference into every Verge comment thread has become a comedy meme now?</p>
<p>When did that happen!?</p>
<p>Even f they were serious, I prefer to think they were joking. Less annoying that way.</p>
<p>In fact, I suggest that any positive comment about Lumia 920 on the Verge to be considered a tongue-in-cheek local joke, the real intentions notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Good strategy for internet comments and life generally I say, if someone is being idiotic just assume they&#8217;re joking. Your life will be a better place for it.</p>
<p>Nah, best I&#8217;ve seen is adding a leading Sir automatically like the Economist :P</p>
<p>You know what&#8217;s a better phone? Lumia 920.</p>
<p>You know what is an even better phone? One that doesn&#8217;t require you to wait months and months for it to be released.</p>
<p>you do know november is next month right?</p>
<p>And the announcement was at the beginning of September. Sort of a ridiculous lead time for such a big deal of a new phone on a new OS.</p>
<p>Moron&#8230;the phone was announced in September and stop defending crappy announcement even though you are MS fanboy.</p>
<p>Most of us don&#8217;t suffer from ADHD, so we&#8217;re perfectly fine with seeing an announcement that early. It kind of makes it easier for us to plan down the road what products we want. You know, most of us aren&#8217;t blindly buying just one brand.</p>
<p>Assuming the rumors are true and its launches November 2nd, considering the announcement was Sept. 5th, that hardly constitutes a &#8220;wait months and months&#8221; statement as stated by the original troll. Either way, the phone is undoubtedly worth waiting for.</p>
<p>It just feels like months and months with the deluge of comments about the thing.</p>
<p>C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!!!</p>
<p>You know what OS does the Lumia run? <br />
oh, WP&#8230;no thanks.</p>
<p>Now how would you know that? It&#8217;s not even publicly available and they won&#8217;t let press really touch or play with it.</p>
<p>looks alone&#8230;&#8230;.no thanks.</p>
<p>the whole metro theme looks like dog vomit.</p>
<p>How do clear cut corners and with live information resemble dog vomit more than a sea of icons like iOS? Not that any of them look like dog vomit, I&#8217;m just saying its probably a good idea to find a better analogy.</p>
<p>I dunno, there are some custom Android skin, widget, and live wallpaper combos that look pretty godawful.  (Same goes for iOS jailbroken themes, but they&#8217;re pretty rare by comparison).  Nothing wrong with the default on any of &#8216;em, though.  Frankly I never credited the kind of people who spend their time trolling tech blogs with much taste generally, so I&#8217;m not surprised some of them inexplicably hate WP&#8217;s UI.</p>
<p>Seriously though. Every friggin article there&#8217;s an MS fanboy who can&#8217;t help but bring up Windows Phone. It&#8217;s like iFans, but at least they had a popular/well-selling phone to kowtow about.</p>
<p>Exactly&#8230;imagine the WP fanboys comments if their product is actually bought by people.</p>
<p>fanboys? more like astroturf</p>
<p>YOU FREAKING IDIOT! He&#8217;s not a WP fan! It&#8217;s just a bunch of non-wp fans who are trying to make a meme out of the Lumia 920 situation because it&#8217;s the most talked about phone and they&#8217;re possibly feeling jellly and it&#8217;s cool to hate on MSFT and WP. If you didn&#8217;t view the world through tinted glasses you&#8217;d see /rant</p>
<p>Minus the freaking idiot part, but the rest of my comment still stands.</p>
<p>please retract the &#8216;jelly&#8217; it&#8217;s soooo 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;make a meme out of the Lumia 920 situation because it’s the most talked about phone&#8221;</p>
<p>That may be true, but the meme is based on fact. You can&#8217;t go anywhere without MS fans derailing comment trains by asserting that X Windows Phone device is the best or X MS service is the best.</p>
<p>Your jimmies sound rustled.</p>
<p>Agree it&#8217;s getting silly.  Most of these comments sound like paid adverts.</p>
<p>Because they most likely are. Either that or some die-hard fanboys came over from Winrumors.</p>
<p>I wonder if any of these tech companies actually do insert comments in popular forums automatically. It can&#8217;t be that hard to do and would explain some (a little) of the insanity on display sometimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lumia 920 situation because it’s the most talked about phone &quot;</p>
<p>lol, ok.</p>
<p>lol at you. Then what is?<br />
Even iP5 fans are invading the Tribe Forum posts to talk about everyone talking about it.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KVCZp.png" /></p>
<p>Congrats Google putting your 4.1 on like the 10th Android device now a whooping 7% of all android users are using 4.1 Google moving up in the ranks haha</p>
<p>Wow. What does that have to do anything?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s he most talked about phone? Really? I hardly hear anything about it. It&#8217;s all iPhone 5 this and Galaxy S3 that.</p>
<p>But I guess the level of Lumia 920 buzz have taken on a weird kind of inside inside inside baseball status where everyone &#8220;gets it&#8221;, yet no one &#8220;gets it&#8221;.</p>
<p>BAA-ZING!!!!</p>
<p>You know the best thing about the UX on Lumia 920 &#8211; no &#8211; wait, I can&#8217;t tell yet.<br />
You know what else has a nice screen? <a href="http://www.theverge.com/products/84lm9600/6052" target="new">this</a>. &lt;\pointless post&gt;</p>
<p>4 comments in&#8230; I am not disappoint.</p>
<p>lol &#8211; the Lumia 920 &#8211; the Godwin&#8217;s Law for The Verge</p>
<p>Being from the Philippines, I keep reading Lumia as Lumpia. <br />
<img src="http://www.cebu-food.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/lumpia_shanghai.jpg" /></p>
<p>now i&#8217;m hungry</p>
<p>Dude, did you really have to post this?  You might as well have posted pictures of rice and the La Choy too.  Gaahhhh I&#8217;m getting hungry now</p>
<p>Mmmmm&#8230; Food porn&#8230;</p>
<p>My coworkers call it the Lumina and it makes me want to punch them in their mouth.</p>
<p>how dare you post this pic without any samples to give out!</p>
<p>You know what&#8217;s a best Lumia? The Lumia 920.</p>
<p>You Lumia what&#8217;s a Lumia Lumia? The Lumia Lumia. Lumia?</p>
<p>Why the Lumia is all the Lumia being Lumia by Lumia? I don&#8217;t Lumia, I just Lumia that its really Lumia.</p>
<p>o_O Are you Captain Lumia? :P</p>
<p>Malkovich?  Malkovich malkovich.</p>
<p>Forget the screen, what about the bootloader?</p>
<p>The man has a point.</p>
<p>Thought they couldn&#8217;t ship devices with Tegra 3 and LTE?  Which was why the US One X had a Snapdragon S4?  Did they overcome that somehow?</p>
<p>Also&#8230;was hoping they&#8217;d bump the RAM to 2GB to match the SGS3.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new Tegra 3 chip. The old tegra chip was to blame for the lack of LTE.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the old Tegrad 3, albeit with a higher clock, still S4 for LTE markets, as Tegra 3 still is not capable of LTE.</p>
<p>Ohh, I misread the article, nothing said about S4. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>It is not. All versions of the One X+ will have a Tegra 3.</p>
<p>Hmm, perhaps there are 2 new handsets coming from HTC? Rumor has it that Verizon is launching a version of this with a 5&quot; 1080p screen but with the S4 Pro&#8212;not with Tegra 3.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the same phone if the screen is that different.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s tegra 3+ or AP37, it is not a different architecture than the average tegra 3, but more stable with higher quality and also includes/compatible with lte modems.</p>
<p>FID. The One X+ ships with a Tegra 3+ which supports LTE. That&#8217;s the whole point of the phone.</p>
<p>No, Tegra 3+ doesn&#8217;t have LTE support by itself, but it is compatible with Qualcomm&#8217;s baseband modems which is being used in this phone LTE support.</p>
<p>Its Tegra 3+. Here are the details of it:</p>
<p>The AP37 gets a 13 per cent speed bump from 1.5GHz to 1.7GHz with the GPU speed raised by 25 per cent to 520MHz. The most important differentiation is that the GPU can now handle a primary display resolution of 1,920 &#215; 1,080 (full HD), compared to 1,366 &#215; 800 previously.<br />
And it adds an LTE plug too.</p>
<p>I think they may be using Qualcomm&#8217;s 28 nm MDM9615 baseband chip for LTE paired with Tegra 3. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the Note 2 is also doing the same set up since its quad core + LTE in US.</p>
<p>What does &#8220;most of the rest of Europe&#8221; mean. I ask sitting in Europe with coverage from several LTE networks on 800 and 2600MHz.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know, too. Most German carriers offer LTE now&#8230; I&#8217;d like to see an XL+.</p>
<p>The One XL did just make it here in france I doubt they&#8217;ll sell the One XL+ for now</p>
<p>There will be no One XL+ since the One XL already supports LTE.</p>
<p>The One X+ supports LTE.</p>
<p>The fact that the iPhone lacks 800Mhz and 2600Mhz should give these devices a huge advantage if they support it.</p>
<p>I was angry that they gave T-Mobile/Orange the ability to use 1800Mhz for LTE in the UK.</p>
<p>1800MHz is a very popular frequency for LTE, so thinking in the long-term it seems like a fine choice to me.  It is irritating that they have been allowed to roll the network out early.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that people understand LTE well enough to base their phone choices on it.  LTE isn&#8217;t active yet, in the UK, and all the iPhone 5s sold out in an instant.  No-one I&#8217;ve spoken to is aware that LTE will soon be available on Orange and T-Mobile, but not on 3, O2 and others, or, indeed, what LTE actually is.</p>
<p>Key phrase being &#8220;in the UK&#8221;. From what I can tell carriers all across Europe have rolled out, are rolling out or will be rolling out LTE, generally speaking, on 800 and 2600MHz. 1800MHz is the spare, only where available, LTE frequency band. It&#8217;s really only because UK regulators are taking their sweet time to auction off 800/2600 that the roll out there is starting with 1800.</p>
<p>Ofcom is being hurried along to sell the 800 and 2600Mhz band, but there is still a part of the UK using 800Mhz for TV (Northern Ireland) because ROI has yet to stop broadcasting TV on 800Mhz.</p>
<p>800Mhz goes much further then 1800Mhz, but the iPhone 5 supports neither 800 or 2600.</p>
<p>One had hoped that the Iphone 5 would be the one stupid exception though.</p>
<blockquote>800Mhz goes much further then 1800Mhz</blockquote>
<p>If you mean that 800MHz is a better frequency for travelling long distances (beneficial for serving rural areas), then the iPhone 5 supports both 850MHz and 700MHz, which have the same benefit.</p>
<p>1800MHz is pretty well spread worldwide, including Europe.  So is 2600MHz.</p>
<p>The rollout here in the UK has started with 1800MHz for a handful of reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The 2600HMz and 800MHz spectrum has not yet been cleared and auctioned off.</li>
	<li>The iPhone 5 supports LTE on 1800MHz, not 2600MHz or 800MHz.</li>
	<li>Everything Everywhere already owned rights to the 1800MHz range.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without any of those three, I think we might have begun our LTE rollout in late 2013 with 800/2600MHz.</p>
<p>But 4G in 800Mhz will be so much better.</p>
<p> - It covers a MUCH wider range per tower then 1800Mhz, meaning its perfect for the countryside.<br />
 - All operators will be using it, meaning interoperability which is the reason why our prices are already incredibly low (£10 for unlimited data).</p>
<p>Where is this place that offers unlimited data for 10 quid?</p>
<p>GiffGaff currently offers 250 minutes, unlimited texts and unlimited data without tethering for £10.</p>
<p>This offer is due to end soon, replaced by 250 minutes, unlimited texts and 1GB of data with tethering.  The original £10 deal will now cost £12.</p>
<p>I was delighted.</p>
<p>- T-Mobile iPhone customer</p>
<p>Is this the first phone with quad-core LTE?</p>
<p>Isnt the Galaxy Note 2 a LTE exynos phone?</p>
<p>The Galaxy S3 has Quad-Core LTE.</p>
<p>Korean Galaxy S3 has Exynos 4 Quad with LTE.</p>
<p>Not just the Korean version, the LTE version of the S3 released in Europe and Asia (and Australia) also have the Quad-Core Exynos.</p>
<p>The 4G LTE variant, what chip does it use?</p>
<p>HTC says it&#8217;s the same Tegra 3 AP37 with a Qualcomm modem.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>It uses the Qualcomm&#8217;s MDM9215 baseband for LTE. For reference iPhone5 uses MDM9615 which has support from some extra frequencies. The only other phone to have MDM9615 is LG Optimus G.</p>
<p>Contrary to what @sabret00the said, Tegra 3+ doesn&#8217;t have LTE support by itself, but it is compatible with Qualcomm&#8217;s baseband modems.</p>
<p>Tegra 3+ <a href="http://androidandme.com/2012/04/news/tegra-3-to-bring-1-7-ghz-cpu-1080p-displays-25-faster-gpu-and-lte-to-phones/" target="_blank">http://androidandme.com/2012/04/news/tegra-3-to-bring-1-7-ghz-cpu-1080p-displays-25-faster-gpu-and-lte-to-phones/</a></p>
<p>Not sure, re-reading the article I&#8217;m wondering how many cores the LTE version will have compared to the non-LTE version.</p>
<p>Four.</p>
<p>There is no non-LTE version though. You should double check.</p>
<p>You are wrong. Actually there are 2 versions, HTC One X+ (LTE) which uses Qualcomm MDM9215 baseband, and HTC One X+ (WCDMA) which uses Intel&#8217;s XMM6260 baseband.</p>
<p>This is really great but 64gb means its going to be crazy expensive. I would have liked the same specs but with 32gb instead/cheaper price</p>
<p>There&#8217;ll be a 32GB option.</p>
<p>Hopefully the 32GB will come in under £500.  Still, if there&#8217;s a new Nexus on the horizon I ain&#8217;t getting one of these.</p>
<p>Same price as the 16GB iPhone</p>
<p>flash memory really isn&#8217;t expensive anymore</p>
<p>I wish they would have just made it 16GB onboard memory with a microSD card slot.</p>
<p>Along with the fact i don&#8217;t like the SenseUI its the reasons it doesn&#8217;t interest me.</p>
<p>Apart from that it&#8217;s a lovely put together phone.</p>
<p>yeah micro sd would be really great but i would still want 64gb onboard</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not expensive anymore, but for some reason it&#8217;s become accepted by consumers that when you want more space on your device, you shell out the cash. Thus it&#8217;s become the biggest area of profit margin for companies making these phones. &#8220;Want to go from 16GB to 32GB? $100 extra. Want to go to 64GB? $150.&#8221;</p>
<p>How much do you think it cost in manufacturing to go from 16 to 32GB? Chump change. I just hope we don&#8217;t continue to see more phones drop the MicroSD card slot for crippled storage options just to make a couple extra bucks.</p>
<p>Imagine this phone with stock Android&#8230;</p>
<p>There are AOSP/CM10 ROMs for the One X. I am guessing that they will be compatible with the One X+.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you know what I mean. A Nexus One X.</p>
<p>Sense 4.1 isn&#8217;t honestly that bad, so I presume Sense 4.5 is better. But HTC make the unlocking boot-loader process fairly simple so if you want an AOSP look you can get it.</p>
<p>Sure they did. You simply put in your imei so they know that you have voided the warranty. Then you give your name and identifying information so they can email you a key.  And after you use their personally identifying, warranty voiding tool, you find you are bootloader unlocked but still S-OFF.  No thanks.</p>
<p>Can they realy void your warrenty simply for going through the process of getting an unlock code? Nothing in that process actually proves that youve gone through and used the code to actually unlock your device.</p>
<p>I think the lack of S-OFF makes the discussion moot.  It&#8217;s just useless tool.</p>
<p>I hate ROMs, I still want that bloody option in settings, the one that just cuts the crap and gives me custom android. Even though i actually quite like Sense, im speaking more about touchwiz (which is hideous, widgets and all)</p>
<p>Considering how baked in Sense is, I think a toggle would probably be impossible.</p>
<p>Definitely not impossible. Stock android is only around 150mb, so worst case scenario, the could just leave a backup of that and allow you to flash it over there custom version with a warning of course so that you don&#8217;t flash your stuff accidentally.</p>
<p>No reason why all phones can&#8217;t have this option, other than they want to try and force you into their ecosystem.</p>
<p>Why not have a stock image available for download that&#8217;s signed with their key?</p>
<p>Still secure, make more people happy, can&#8217;t be hard to make an AOSP based image for a device (Community devs do a great job and are usually working w/o drivers etc!)</p>
<p>Same here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve a Galaxy Note, was palatable running 2.3.6, but was a battery killing,buggy slow piece of £&amp;@) when 4.0 came along. Installed CM9, boom, became a super phone.  That said, while Im able to use custom roms, I really can&#8217;t be arsed. In future, Nexus or bust pour moi.</p>
<p>thanks but i quite like the added functionality of sense</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m almost ready to call this my next. If the Nexus &#8216;12 lineup doesn&#8217;t dazzle me , this will be my next.</p>
<p>No white variant for the One X+?</p>
<p>If you look at the pics, it comes in white.</p>
<p>I thought that&#8217;s the old One (sorry for the pun)</p>
<p>You are correct, that is the old one. The person above you must of skimmed through the article, black is the only option.</p>
<p>Next HTC phone &#8211; The HTC Elder God</p>
<p>if you read the article, it only comes in black.</p>
<p>No white version, black only. The white handset in the gallery is the original One X.</p>
<p>Oh darn.</p>
<p>Thats a deal breaker.</p>
<p>For me too, the white one looks muche better.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no white version because matte white gets dirty. That&#8217;s why the Lumia 900 and all other white phones are glossy.</p>
<p>I know right?! Looks like grocery store feet after a few months. I had to take an alcohol pad to mine and scrub it like hell. Reminds me of my old white Macbook with the matte white palmrests.</p>
<p>So does this mean it might come to Verizon?</p>
<p>No its a GSM/HSPA/(LTE (in some markets)) device.</p>
<p>Weak sauce&#8230;</p>
<p>Happy pants. Looking forward to this. I will have a tough decision to make in a month or so. This damn Galaxy Note is headed to eBay&#8230;.</p>
<p>Sounds like you&#8217;ve already made the decision :/</p>
<p>To get rid of his Note, not on what to buy to replace it.</p>
<p>No LTE support in Euroland? Why fragment the device like this?</p>
<p>Because 80% of the network operators aren&#8217;t running it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be buying a phone to keep for two years. I&#8217;d like it to support technologies that will be available within that timeline.</p>
<p>This may rock the floor in terms of CPU performance. The processor has a DDR3 memory controller. This may improve CPU performance maybe the GPU too.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tegra">Apparently, the Tegra 3s found in the Nexus 7 and the Asus Infinitys </a>already have DDR3 and those aren&#8217;t setting any records so I doubt this will be much more than an incremental upgrade over the current 1.5ghz model.</p>
<p>Until Tegra adopts a dual-channel controller, it&#8217;s not going to be doing anything. The Asus Transformer Infinity TF700t has DDR3-1600 if I&#8217;m not mistaken. That&#8217;s just stupid. Tegra 3 CANNOT saturate that&#8230; but since Asus used a 1200p panel and Tegra 3 can&#8217;t push that competently with DDR2 on a single channel&#8230;</p>
<p>I really do hate Tegra. 2 AND 3. And whatever bullshit is coming next.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; Still the same phone with the oversized camera bump that tries to make the camera look better than it actually is.</p>
<p>After years of owning only iphones, the One X was the first android phone I bought. I hated the camera on that thing &#8211; the pictures I was getting were horrible.</p>
<p>I switched to the GS3 and my one and only complaint about it is the horrendous touchwiz. Running CM10 though, the GS3 is by far my favorite phone I&#8217;ve owned.</p>
<blockquote>After years of owning only iphones, the One X was the first android phone I bought. I hated the camera on that thing – the pictures I was getting were horrible.</blockquote>
<p>Same here! iPhones to One X<br />
Didnt you find the SIII pentile screen a let down after the One X?</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t you now agree that the One X camera is pretty good, at least comparable to the iPhone4S?</p>
<p>Yes pretty good better in low light shots than the 4s, it was its over saturated screen that was making the pics look color inaccurate haha</p>
<p>I want want want a HTC Nexus One X.</p>
<p>HTC and Somy next gen Nexus would be heaven. Always loved HTC&#8217;s design.</p>
<p>Root a One X then, I did and I am running a stock rom and its gorgeous. <br />
So fast and smooth. :)</p>
<p>Can AOSP roms utilise the imagechip or is it just standard software image processing if you swap out HTC&#8217;s OS?</p>
<p>its not just rooting. i havent used an one x before so i wouldnt know but it sure looks like fixed hardware buttons to me &#8211; that alone would render jb sub par. <br />
biggest gripe would be the community. nexus has all the fresh roms and mods, one x gets ports and kangs. its just not the same when developers have to use leaks and hacks. aosp supports&#8217;s doing so much for a device, it weights more for me than chipsets and megapixel ever will. right now i&#8217;d still take nexus instead of onex+.<br />
still, i dont get these companies. this is plain stupidity. taiwan is a cool country, they are nice people. why this bootloader locking bullshit and why adulterating the OS? what in the world makes these people think its the way to go?</p>
<p>A Sony Nexus would be great.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m holding out for the HTC One X ++</p>
<p>But what about the One X+++, that&#8217;s gonna be the shizzle. It will wipe the floor with the iPhone 6S mark my words!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s ironic about this device. Motorola was blasted by folks for releasing the Razr Maxx and HTC is pulling the same trick.</p>
<p>This should have been the One X but hey better late than never. This is a tough market so HTC should try more in the future.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t like the red buttons and the black seems to just accentuate the beats branding but other than that, this is almost perfect.</p>
<p>HTC&#8217;s version of Droid RazR Maxx?</p>
<blockquote>HTC’s version of <strike>Droid</strike> <strong>Motorola</strong> RazR Maxx?</blockquote>
<p>droid razr maxx hd by motorola</p>
<p>is the full name of the most comparable phone made by motorola, here. if you&#8217;re going to be like that, do it right.</p>
<p>No its just the GSM version does not have DROID in the name since DROID is used by Verizon, and this phone is not on Verizon neither is it CDMA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/consumers/DROID-RAZR-MAXX-HD-BY-MOTOROLA/m-DROID-RAZR-MAXX-HD,en_US,pd.html" target="_blank">http://www.motorola.com/us/consumers/DROID-RAZR-MAXX-HD-BY-MOTOROLA/m-DROID-RAZR-MAXX-HD,en_US,pd.html</a></p>
<p>wrong and wrong. now, it&#8217;s not out <em>yet</em> on verizon, but it will be. verizon is pretty much the only US carrier for moto&#8217;s main line.</p>
<p>but it looks like we are fighting over a regional naming difference.</p>
<p>Late slip :P<br />
This was leaked in the o2 Mag here in the Uk Last week.</p>
<p>Increasing the Battery capacity is by and far the best possible direction manufacturers can go towards now to improve overall customer satisfaction.  Enough of this thinner lighter phone crap, please spend a few more billion in Battery research so that we can have a phone that lasts AT LEAST a day of full hardcore usage!!!  I know that from a marketing standpoint, and perhaps even in certain flawed focus group studies, that people undoubtedly prefer phones with thinner profiles and more raw power but in reality a longer lasting phone is far far more beneficial to users than any other feature improvement even if users don&#8217;t know it&#8230;</p>
<p>So they put a similar battery size as the EVO LTE, congrats? Still not big enough.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s the right direction but as I mentioned, we need to put a few Billion more towards the battery</p>
<p>Sadly battery technology has not kept up with processors etc :(</p>
<p>The battery in the RAZR MAXX certainly has.</p>
<p>Not really, though, the Razr added to battery life simply by increasing the size.</p>
<p>The underlying battery technology is no better.</p>
<p>The Razr also doesn&#8217;t have anywhere near the performance of the iPhone 5 or SG3, for example &#8211; so it has made 2 compromises.</p>
<p>RAZR MAXX HD does. Keep in mind the original RAZR MAXX is based of the RAZR which was unveiled when the Galaxy Nexus was. The phone is old.</p>
<p>completely agree. Not once in the 10+ years of owning a cell phone have I thought &#8220;I wish this phone were thinner!&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest thing to happen to One X since One X!</p>
<p>used to have an one x, battery sucked big time, switched to GS3, love it so far but miss the gorgeous screen. it will be a hard decision for me between one x+ and GNote2</p>
<p>Hmm I looked at the GS3 also as the HTC One X (<em>my current phone</em>) is doing my head in when it comes to battery life. You mentioned that the screen is a feature you missed. Do you think you can get used to it in time? The One X screen is so beautiful and it seriously makes me laugh that so many &#8216;tech&#8217; sites use the GS3 to compare screen quality to the iPhone 5. Wrong choice!!</p>
<p>Same I&#8217;m like really tech blogs? You compared probably the weakest of the 720p displays against the iPhone 5, and ignore HTC&#8217;s and LG vastly superior displays for IPS and SuperLCD2. I just don&#8217;t grasp why they ignore better phones in that category</p>
<p>It could be because review sites tend to think the S3 is a better phone overall even in spite of disproportionate specs or features against some of its rivals. It could be because they&#8217;re getting kickbacks from Samsung, which wouldn&#8217;t surprise me given how heavily they are marketing the S3(and how much money they are spending to do it, getting TV spots at virtually every major event). It could also be that buyers are more likely to be considering an S3 upfront so it is more useful to bring it up in comparisons more than some of its rivals simply  because you get more clicks from things like &#8220;how does the S3 compare to the&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I mean, say you&#8217;re reviewing the iPhone 5, does it really make sense to compare the screen to the One X, the processor to the S3, the battery life to the Droid Razr Maxx and the camera to the Lumia 920? If it takes 4 separate devices that on their own <strong>might</strong> have superior individual parts but no singular device has them all, then it&#8217;s not a very useful comparison for the sake of consumer electronics. If you&#8217;re trying to determine what is technically the best, then leave that to sites like Arstechnica and anandtech who will may do those comparisons but also do in-depth analyses on the technical capabilities of each component. But there is a good reason why sites like Verge don&#8217;t specialize in those breakdowns, because smartphones very often are more than the sum of their parts and actual ownership/usage does not always align well with theoretical performance or technical achievement.</p>
<p>According to HTC, the One X+ has a 67% better performance and 50% longer battery than the One X. But anyway this phone is great but I&#8217;ll wait till google Allthings we might get another surprise there :)</p>
<p>I wonder if you can take the battery out of the HOX+ and put it in the HOX.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but when it released maybe a compagny like iFixed will figure that out,  but I doubt the battery life is related only to the battery size there are probably some other optimisations hardware and software wize (aka lower consumption modems, rams, memory&#8230;.)</p>
<p>Mr HTC, you manage to make 4 colors for Windows 8 based phones but just one for android ?</p>
<p>Come on !</p>
<p>Make it in white please&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure they could make the OneX+ in any colour they want. They just chose not to&#8230;</p>
<p>If you like phones that are supported for 6 months go for it. Search google for templates how to beg htc for updates after that (20 000 strong petition to get the promised ICS (4.0) for most popular Desire HD)</p>
<p><strong>htc has take your money and run approach to after sales support!</strong></p>
<p>SENT FROM MY LAST HTC PHONE</p>
<p>i actually agree with you (i am still using a dhd) but sadly htc still makes the most beautiful android devices (sony is pretty close though)</p>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--JH6p81fKhI/TiUsR644BPI/AAAAAAAACt0/ftjwdgwZ1n8/HTC.jpg" /></p>
<p>because the Desire HD came out 6 month ago? right of course! the DHD came out in 2010, and the phones that came out at the same time from other manufacturers, weren&#8217;t even tested to get ICS.</p>
<p>Nexus S.</p>
<p>we are talking about OEM not Nexus phones. and it is the only 2010 phone to have tasted ICS</p>
<p>The point being these devices can run ICS. It&#8217;s a shame that OEMs don&#8217;t support their phones like a Nexus device. It&#8217;s understandable why, but it sucks.</p>
<p>Just for the record, EE have already said they&#8217;ll support the One X+, contrary to what Vlad misinforms.</p>
<p>Sad news, first, the white version was way prettier, and second, those red buttons, while not ugly enough to kill the design, are ugly. But the worst part, is this seems to rule out the HTC as the new galaxy nexus OEM.</p>
<p>I agree, don&#8217;t like the new red buttons</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, this definitely means no HTC nexus.</p>
<p>Why do you think it rules out a Nexus? We know HTC is DEFINITELY making a 5-inch device, rumoured to be 1080p (that was less certain, but Sharp ramping up production might be a signal).. It&#8217;s that device that the HTC Nexus rumours hinged around, not the One X+.</p>
<p>Smart move by HTC to release a new flagship after the SGSIII and before the new Nexus.</p>
<p>Love my Tegra 3 One X which shipped on the first day Clove got stock, but I could certainly deal with a bigger battery and more power. That said, I do prefer the white version. 32GB has been plenty of storage for me, but more wouldn&#8217;t go amiss. Not sure what I&#8217;m going to do here, might have to wait for final pricing. I can still get quite a bit for my OG One X used so it may come down to the performance and battery tests vs the increase in cost.</p>
<p>One S is the one the chips, right? So this is great news. Those red capacitive buttons looks nice.</p>
<p>Sense 4+? I don&#8217;t want an image hub, I want stock android.</p>
<p>Then flash it,.</p>
<p>Many people like sense,</p>
<p>Thanks, but I would prefer not to void warranty.<br />
And by the way, many people also <em>don&#8217;t</em> like Sense.<br />
:)</p>
<p>So at&amp;t is going to launch it here in states? I hope they just sell an unlocked version that works on US LTE</p>
<p>If you are going to plaster &#8220;Beats&#8221; all over the phone, at least provide some Beats branded earbuds.<br />
Don&#8217;t have to be super expensive ones, but at least something halfway decent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little dishonest not to.</p>
<p>Agreed, it&#8217;s meant to be better than the One X, at least deliver on that</p>
<p>HTC said they would stop delivering headphones in their products because people don&#8217;t buy cellphones for included earbuds. Plus, their profits aren&#8217;t exactly huge.</p>
<p>Those red buttons are atrocious&#8230;they may look alright on the Rezound, but the One X design definitely does not lend itself to that&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, I was kind of hoping it was some sort of Verizon branding thing.. but no :(</p>
<p>Does the Sense 4+ skin (or touchwiz in Samsung&#8217;s case) allow the use of Jelly Bean features such as &#8220;Google Now&#8221; as easily as on stock Jelly Bean?</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad it isn&#8217;t that much better otherwise I would be so jealous! I hope someone leaks the jellybean rom soon though!</p>
<p>No white version? That was what made the One X so sexy! Sorry but I&#8217;ll pass</p>
<p>Sigh, if only it was here a month or two ago.</p>
<p>Originally the rumors said the OneX+ was intented to be a device that could run on all GSM carriers in the US, but reading the article I&#8217;m not seeing anything about it having improved antennas, just LTE, does this mean the phone will not run on Tmobile USA?  please tell me it will, I love my G Nexus but I would jump to this phone the second it comes out.</p>
<p>I second that.  I want another high end option on TMO.</p>
<p>agreed the GS3 is great, but after having a Vibrant and later owning a Sidekick (in part because of my stupidity) I&#8217;m not touching anything that has Samsung on it and doesnt have Stock Android on it.</p>
<p>Forget it about everything else. The Real question is.</p>
<p>Where can I order it right now? Since I&#8217;m in the US</p>
<p>Got a One X but won&#8217;t be upgrading to a One X+ or XL because, frankly, the phone isn&#8217;t that good and the bump in speed and memory isn&#8217;t going to save it.  Let&#8217;s see what the next Nexus phone looks like&#8230;</p>
<p>Stop making a million phones D:</p>
<p>Please make this device into a Nexus&#8230;</p>
<p>Brand new HTC device! You have never seen this before :)</p>
<p>so the us version will have lte and a tegra 3?</p>
<p>You will have to ask your operator, considering that the US operators removed the Exynos from the S3, then probably not.</p>
<p>Why does it take the 2nd go around to put real size batteries in these phones? Tired of the whole embedded thing especially when people get hosed for two years on the first model only to see a mid year intro of what the original should&#8217;ve been. So glad I&#8217;m sticking with my 2+ yr old Epic.</p>
<p>Integrated battery = instant deal breaker.</p>
<p>Well if you want a thin phone with a better battery life you have to lock in the battery. Most phones will not have removable anything in few years.</p>
<p>I disagree, you don&#8217;t need to lock in the battery to get a slimmer design.</p>
<p>The LG Optimus 4X HD is 8.9mm thick the same as the OneX and has a removable battery. <br />
The new LG Optimus G is slimmer at. 8.45mm and as far as i know has a removable battery also.</p>
<p>I would say it&#8217;s probably the lazy way of doing things by locking it in.</p>
<p>The entire appeal of the design is the seamless unibody shell, though.</p>
<p>All I know is that all smartphones had removable battery. Since 2007 that number is drastically been going down.</p>
<p>Almost there HTC!  I love the 64GB memory so I can give up my wish on a micro sd slot.  BUT raising the battery to only 2100 mAh?!?!  You&#8217;re only trying to match S3!  Why can&#8217;t you match Droid Razr Maxx&#8217;s battery of 3300 mAh?!  Common!</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t hit the 3300 mAh mark then at least make the battery removable&#8230;.  darn&#8230; :-((</p>
<p>Aiming for a 2400-2500mAh battery would have been ideal.</p>
<p>Yaaaawn.. Ugly Beats themed phone.</p>
<p>A bigger battery &#8230; well Ill be damned HTC, you do pay attention to consumers.  Now just get rid of sense.</p>
<p>oh batter my heart three person god</p>
<p>Looks like it&#8217;s going to AT&amp;T. I&#8217;d like to see Verizon get it or something that isn&#8217;t Motorola junk.</p>
<p>why didn&#8217;t they give their windows phones specs like this?  stupid htc.</p>
<p>Windows Phone doesn&#8217;t yet support quad-core processors, as far as I&#8217;m aware. What other specs were you hoping to see?</p>
<p>And by the way, the 8X has a better front-facing camera and dedicated 2.5v headphone amp, unlike the One X+. ;-)</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t htc just update the one x? Samsung is pushing out the jellybean update to the s3 as we speak and all htc can do is promise an update within the year?</p>
<p>The Jelly Bean update for the One X will be out this month.</p>
<p>Well, there it is.  My phone is officially ancient!</p>
<blockquote>proving once again that it&#8217;s more expedient for phone makers to just build new handsets than to update old ones</blockquote>
<p>I want this phone so bad, but if this is really going to still be the case, even after HTC centralizes around a single line of phones, it&#8217;s a deal breaker.</p>
<p>ICS+ standard buttons&#8230; still not virtual? I guess we&#8217;ll still see a black bar with the menu button on non-ICS+ optimized apps.</p>
<p>No, HTC got rid of that in an update.<br />
At least I think.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s changed. You can now map the recent apps button to be your menu button so you never see the black bar.</p>
<p>But does pressing and holding the home button bring out the recent apps screen?</p>
<p>Red capacitive buttons?</p>
<p>Why release a timely update when you can just sell people a new phone. Yes i know there is always CM, but i  acually like my warranty intact.</p>
<p>With Jelly Bean coming to the original One X and One S this month, isn&#8217;t that timely enough? The Jelly Bean source code was only released on July 9th!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s funny is that when the iPhone 5s comes out, it&#8217;ll be just like this (primarily upgraded speed), but take a year before releasing.</p>
<p>Wow so to get the latest Android OS you have to buy a whole new phone. That&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>At said in the other article, the HOX is getting the update this month.</p>
<p>Wow, what an iterative upgrade from the One.  Apple gets so much $hit for building an entirely new phone that only resembles the previous one in a few ways&#8230;.</p>
<p>No, they get $hit for their OS hardly evolving over the last 6 years.</p>
<p>It evolves with every point release. It just doesn`t look different every time doing it.</p>
<p>It evolves by implementing tech and features that have been a norm in Android and WP for previous years&#8230;. yep&#8230; top of the line indeed.</p>
<p>Eh, in fairness, they get shit for everything. Kind of comes with the territory of being as big as they are, had they dramatically changed the way iOS looked and functioned, you can be sure they&#8217;d have gotten shit for that.</p>
<p>how many upgrades did the One X had? Just one&#8230; how many times has the iPhone been drastically redesigned? 1, the difference is that Apple makes a big event out of it and treats it like its the cream of the crop.</p>
<p>What a ridiculously idiotic analogy. Apple release 1 phone a year. One. And yes, it should be an event, as its the ONE AND ONLY phone we see from them for at least 12 months.</p>
<p>Good design is supposed to be timeless.</p>
<p>How many generations did Apple reuse the MBP design? It&#8217;s been around since 2008, and it still looks pretty good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so confused. Why are there comparison shots when the device is physically the same? Do we really need to see a width comparison when the only things that have changed are the color and Beats logo?</p>
<p>Nooooooo&#8230;I was hoping T-Mobile would finally get the real HTC One device. :(</p>

<p>I&#8217;m holding out for the One X +8 that should be out in a few months &#8230;</p>
<p>I was pretty interested in the One X initially, this spec boost seems decent enough, but also a little bit awkward, is this going to become a precedent now? The Droid Razr Maxx already kind of started the trend I guess, but I don&#8217;t think having mid-cycle spec boosts is really what the smartphone market needs or even necessarily wants.</p>
<p>Personally, after seeing what the iPhone 5 could do performance wise in a significantly smaller body than every high-end Android phone, I want to see more OEMs move in that direction and at least offer as an option something that is high performance but still small.</p>
<p>This is the problem with Android phones. You can&#8217;t be confident buying anything with no guarantee an upgraded version will be released 6 seconds later. I mean, come on.</p>
<p>When was the One X announced? Like January?</p>
<p>I thought it was at MWC in February, may have been before that though.</p>
<p>Why is that a problem? Does your 6 month old phone suddenly stop functioning? I don&#8217;t mind it. It&#8217;s the way of the industry.</p>
<p>The Nexus that wasn&#8217;t to be? (Also HTC, you should be focusing on getting 4.1 on to the existing One series devices, not adding to them)</p>
<p>WHOA!! congrats another one of Android phones has the newest 4.1 update! Wait that makes 10 devices Android has Jelly Bean on now 7% of Android is using 4.1 and over 50% of us iOS users are using iOS 6! Moving up Google haha Google is pathetic</p>
<p>Getting a gimped version of iOS6 that all of Apple&#8217;s mindless consumers will think is the exact same version of iOS6 on their buddy&#8217;s iPhone 5 compared to their iPhone 4 is what&#8217;s pathetic.</p>
<blockquote>the One X+ is HTC&#8217;s first Jelly Bean device, proving once again that it&#8217;s more expedient for phone makers to just build new handsets than to update old ones.</blockquote>
<p>This is sad. And what makes it worse, is there have always been consistent lines that i&#8217;ve heard from people regarding updates</p>
<ol>
	<li>Root your phone, it&#8217;s android, do the updates yourself</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t buy obscure phones, or less than flagship phones, they don&#8217;t get timely updates if at all</li>
	<li>Make sure you choose certain brands over others, avoid motorola</li>
	<li>stick with nexus because they always get updates right away</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, not all people want to go through the hassle of doing the whole custom ROMs thing, but i guess it&#8217;s the only guaranteed method of insuring updates, if you&#8217;re technically inclined. But the One X was far from an obscure phone, it&#8217;s HTCs flagship. HTC is supposed to be one of the brands that are all in with android, and as gar as Nexus phones&#8230;the Nexus S on sprint and Galaxy Nexus on verizon have had super delayed updates. I guess the new answer now is to only buy unlocked galaxy phones/continue to flash custom ROMs.</p>
<blockquote>Owners of the original One X, the LTE-equipped One XL, and the mid-tier One S <strong>will also see their phones updated</strong>, but HTC says that will follow the launch of the One X+, completing <strong>by the end of the year.</strong></blockquote>
<p>The original One X is getting updated.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a step back from the gray One X in the style department. I love the gray on mine. It&#8217;s much more distinctive in the sea of black phones. I also hate the red capacitive keys, and the giant beats logo. Internally, this is the phone that the One XL should have been from the beginning.</p>
<p>If only it had a removable battery.  The lack of one is a no-go for me.  Right now I&#8217;ve got a Samsung Galaxy S II.  I have a separate charger and spare battery.  I end up swapping several times a day.  I&#8217;m a heavy user, so even if the HTC had better battery life, it wouldn&#8217;t be <em>that </em>much better&#8230;.</p>
<p>Its a bigger phone then Motorola MAXX. Still a 2100mAh battery, that too on a revised edition.<br />
 If Motorola can shove in 3300mAh battery into it&#8217;s phone, why can&#8217;t HTC do the same? Or want to save $5 and 10g of weight.</p>
<p>HTC One X+ :- Dimensions	134.4 &#215; 69.9 &#215; 8.9 mm, Weight 135g, Battery 2100mAh</p>
<p>Motorola Razor MAXX :-130.7 &#215; 68.9 &#215; 9 mm, Weight 145g, Battery 3300mAh</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of revision HTC? I didn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p><strong>they should use the original android software</strong></p>
<p>I love me the Android but this crap has to stop! Why not just sell the device right away with these features? I would be pissed if I bought the original device just to find out they put one out months later with features I could use.</p>
<p>Make this the next Nexus phone.</p>
<p>HTC needs to remove the Beats branding from their devices. It&#8217;s an awful gimmick. The only plus side of the branding is the great red/black color scheme.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve managed to get both Jelly Bean and WP7.5 to co-boot on an older HTC.  The difference is stark.  Running on the same hardware, WP just blows Jelly Bean away &#8211; by about 50:1.  It&#8217;s amazing.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean?  No thinks.  I&#8217;ll wait for Kumquat.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t help feeling I dodged a massive bullet here, was ready to shell out $550 for a 1X in May. We all know that, to protect the bottom line they have to bolster quarterly figures and keep the hold-outs coming back before two year contracts run out and a new flock of free agents are on the market. What they haven&#8217;t figured out is how to make compelling comeback products before those contracts run out. Seriously doubt HTC had any idea they&#8217;d get a nexus device in the last quarter of &#8216;11 or they were just too focused releasing a unified line they hadn&#8217;t realise they&#8217;d be going head to head against themselves within the year.</p>
<p>To wit, HTC has finally figured out you want a flagship per software platform per year bravo! Now  work out   making that flagship compelling across the board going strong for 12months. <br />
Suggestions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Sign contracts for next years latest, not last years greatest components</li>
	<li>Woo Sharp and Toshiba hard, they make screens and they&#8217;re not much interested in anything outside Japan.</li>
	<li>Sometimes one carrier is all it takes ergo Evo 4G.</li>
	<li>Finally loose your &#8220;Sense&#8221; you&#8217;d be packing a nominal nexus. You could in fact wrap sense features around AOSP kinda like CM, make them Settings options.<br />
<blockquote>Just WRAP, don&#8217;t BAKE.</blockquote>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parts of this phone should have been the first one.  HTC&#8217;s 16GB phones are unusable.  You get basically 6GB of usable space.  9.9 to start, 1-2 gigs of cache for image thumbnails in the gallery, another few hundred for google music caching if you use the cloud (which you have to, since you have no storage), and everything else that caches.  I have a 16GB EVO LTE and when I had 5GB of music on the internal memory I ran out of space because of all the standard cacheing from things.  Had to move it off onto the SD, and I have no idea how anyone uses the One X without running into problems.</p>
<p>This is exactly why we can&#8217;t have nice things.</p>
<p>Why Why Black? EVERYBODY has said that we LIKED WHITE COVER MORE!!!</p>
<p>Unless White will be for Higher end HTC phone, I don&#8217;t understand what are they doing&#8230; /:</p>
<p>That is not a small number!</p>
<p>That is a big number!</p>
<p>Yo Apple. No need for a 7&quot; tablet, Google&#8217;s got this. ;)</p>
<p>I think Josh just justified my purchase. Thanks a bunch.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LjFmr.gif" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for more tablet centric content. I&#8217;ll pass for now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still not better than an iPad in terms of it&#8217;s battery life, screen, wealth of content &amp; apps made for it&#8217;s size. The iPad still reigns supreme in that division &amp; if Apple comes out with a 7&quot; version of the iPad 2/3, I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;d still be a better buy than the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>haters are always going to hate&#8230;..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not hating, it&#8217;s just not that amazing. It&#8217;s big Galaxy Nexus with updated software. A cool device but it&#8217;s just not better than the iPad.</p>
<p>The iPad is 2½ times as expensive. It really does sound like you are hating.</p>
<p>Quality costs money dude.</p>
<p>Sure but not everyone wants quality for a higher price. Apple themselves have dipped into this before and I expect them to do it again. The second any 7&quot; tablet has real market success they will be right there either with a 7&quot; iPad or, more likely IMO, something more like a 5-6&quot; iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Exactly. Also, between an 8GB iPod touch for $199 and This awesome Nexus 7, the N7 is the better buy, no matter what you say.</p>
<p>Quality costs money, yes but it doesn&#8217;t cost as much as Apple used to forward to customers in the cost. Think. They were able to become the richest company in the U.S from their product sales. It&#8217;s no secret that Apple sells at an astronomical markup. Everything they&#8217;ve ever sold they make a giant profit on. Why? Because they&#8217;ve tricked certain people into thinking they are the best items on earth and if you own one, you&#8217;re cool/smarter/better than others. As human beings, many of us secretly want to feel that way. Apple has remarkably played this up so potently as to trick their fans into paying the highest premium for their devices. That is an impressive feat.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it obvious that they are selling a perception more so than quality if they&#8217;re able to make those kinds of profits?<br />
What you&#8217;re likely getting is a device with similar guts as the competition, save for a metal casing and the fallacy that it&#8217;s of better quality than the competition. But you refuse to believe that, and so the fanboy emotions get all heated.</p>
<p>Of course folks will have to justify buying iDevices until they bleed; if you buy 1 of 2 items for more money and they are in reality, equal to each other in design and makeup then you&#8217;d be labeled a sucker. No one wants to be a sucker, especially if they believe they are better than someone else. God forbid.</p>
<p>To each his own I say. I like to see the quality and function in all tech. The Nexus 7 is impressive for the price, and if Apple can release a 7 iPad with similar specs for a similar price then that will only be better for us all as consumers.</p>
<p>I just want to point out that having a bunch of money sitting in a bank account does not make you &#8220;the richest company in America&#8221;. It just means you have the most cash.</p>
<p>The iPad is 2 ½ times expensive because Apple chooses to have incredible profit margins. Google is making that sacrifice. The iPad could be a $300, maybe $250 device if Apple didn&#8217;t care about it&#8217;s margins, what would be the end result then? Or is the screen size still a big enough difference to not warrant a comparison. I&#8217;m not hating, I&#8217;m stating my opinion.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s $500. Your argument of &#8220;could be&#8221; doesn&#8217;t matter. The iPad is $500, this is $200. This is a fantastic bang for its buck.</p>
<p>Yes it&#8217;s a great bang for it&#8217;s buck, that isn&#8217;t my argument. My argument is that it is still not better than an iPad, which is truly isn&#8217;t, in it&#8217;s whole.</p>
<p>My argument is that it is, on the whole, for its price.</p>
<p>I believe, even at it&#8217;s price the iPad 2 would still be a more worthwhile &amp; full featured device to but at $400.</p>
<p>buy*</p>
<p>The problem with there is, the iPad 2 only support iOS 6 lite. You don&#8217;t get all of the OS features like the iPad 3.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s still twice as expensive, with a lower resolution display thant the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>iOS 6 &#8220;lite&#8221; as you like to call it doesn&#8217;t take away from the hundreds of thousands of useful creation &amp; media consumption apps available. On top of what Apple already provides. The screen is another issue. But even with the inferior screen you still get an overall better &amp; more useful device.</p>
<p>Wow you really are trolling a review about the Google Nexus 7 pretty hard. I always feel like someone has done something incredibly right when someone like you has to come out of the woodworks and defend your precious iPad so hard when it&#8217;s nearly irrelevant to this article.</p>
<p>Then let&#8217;s hope for Google&#8217;s sake that your feeling is totally off since no device in competition with the iPad has been very successful at all.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t they have a 10&quot; one? What&#8217;s the deal with Android phones being huge and their tablets being small?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slashgear.com/google-nexus-10-reportedly-in-pipeline-29236412/" target="_blank">http://www.slashgear.com/google-nexus-10-reportedly-in-pipeline-29236412/</a></p>
<p>The reason is simple, the biggest cost of the tablet is the screen.  No Android vendor can match the cost and the quality of large retina display.  So Google is going to the cheap and inferior small display route!  People ought to know why 40&quot; HDTV costs more than 20&quot; TV.</p>
<p>Of course they can.   It&#8217;s not like Apple makes the display themselves, Samsung does.  And Samsung is also an Android vendor.</p>

<p>Because 10&quot; tablets make no sense.  You can&#8217;t fit them in any pocket or purse, and if I&#8217;m going to carry something extra around with me, it&#8217;s going to be an air or ultrabook because they are WAY more versatile.</p>
<p>You can fit the 7&quot; in your pocket? That&#8217;s nuts.</p>
<p>yes.w</p>
<p>&#8220;You can fit the 7&#8221; in your pocket? That’s nuts.&quot;<br />
Yep, it fits nicely in my back jeans pocket or a coat pocket.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t know how people fit a note into their pockets.</p>
<blockquote>Because 10&quot; tablets make no sense</blockquote>
<p>You are seriously arguing that 10&quot; tablets make no sense? After the success of iPad?</p>
<p>Look the Nexus 7 is a <em>great</em> tablet, and the 7&quot; form factor is very nice. But don&#8217;t say stupid things like &#8220;10&#8221; tablets make no sense.&quot; That is just plain false.</p>
<p>Just because something sells well doesn&#8217;t mean people continue to find the device ideal after purchase.  Especially when something is marketed as hard as the iPad in a market that changes as quickly as technology.</p>
<p>You think everyone that bought a snuggy still uses it and finds it to be better than a microplush blanket that can be had for a few bucks less?</p>
<p>10&quot; tablets did make sense when the iPad first came to market because they were much more portable and had much better battery life than any laptop.</p>
<p>However, in today&#8217;s market you can get a thin laptop in the same price range that competes on battery life but gives you extra versatility.  (and everyone that I know that had 10+&quot; tablets now find themselves migrating back toward macbooks and ultrabooks.)</p>
<p>So why buy a 10&quot;+ tablet in today&#8217;s market?</p>
<blockquote>10&quot; tablets did make sense when the iPad first came to market because they were much more portable and had much better battery life than any laptop.</blockquote>
<p>I think you completely miss the point. A 10&quot; tablet may not make sense to you, but they make perfect sense in the current market: <em>they are still selling extremely well — as in, right now. They are orders of magnitude more popular than any other tablet.</em>.</p>
<p>When they stop selling well (we&#8217;ll see when that happens), it&#8217;s fine to say they don&#8217;t make sense. But currently they make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I sold my iPad for $275 (considering Apple is selling them for $299, that&#8217;s pretty good.) because it was just too big. At 225.77 (after shipping and taxes), I bought the Nexus 7 8GB. For me, 7&quot; will be perfect. It&#8217;s small enough to truly be portable, but big enough that I can see with squinting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because phone apps don&#8217;t look good on a 10&quot; screen. But on a 7&quot; they are passable.</p>
<p>Being huge is being different from the tiny iPhone, being small is being different from the big iPad.</p>
<p>Toshiba has an Android tablet bigger than any iOS device.</p>
<p>They probably feel a Chromebook would be the better choice for bigger sized devices?</p>
<p>Android apps market growing quickly with buit-in google products and services. I thought it&#8217;s not the issue anymore?? The new jelly bean has offline GPS and better voice search quality than Siri as I read the review.  199$ is a real deal. I&#8217;ll buy 2 for my family intead of the ipad2 anytime</p>
<p>The problem is the severe lack of tablet apps.</p>
<p>atleast normal apps can adapt to the screen instead of having to be magnified</p>
<p>Every time I hear someone say, &#8220;severe lack of tablet apps,&#8221; I get confused &#8212; do regular non-tablet apps not work on tablets? Just because they aren&#8217;t <em>optimized </em>for tablets, doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t work at all. There&#8217;s a big difference between core functionality and extras &#8212; as far as I can tell, Google Maps works the same on a phone, just that the detail window is a separate  fragment in the tablet-optimized version. I don&#8217;t get why Josh and so many others have to complain, as if when you buy a tablet, you literally only have 100 apps to choose from.</p>
<p>Help me out here, tablet-app-shortage people, what am I missing? Obviously it would be <em>nice </em>to have every app optimized for tablets, but what keeps you from using &#8220;phone apps&#8221; on a tablet?</p>
<p>Not true at all. My Transformer Prime was filled with mostly tablet apps.</p>
<p>Not as many as ios doesn&#8217;t automatically mean severe lack.</p>
<p>That is a ridiculous &#8220;problem&#8221; without specifics.  The iPad 2 is getting 99% of iOS 6.  If you can explain which lacking features make an iPad 2 with iOS 6 a poor device, you might have an actual argument.  Is there even anything other than Siri the iPad 2 won&#8217;t get with iOS 6?</p>
<p>Siri gets 99% of Apples advertising time on the telly&#8230; So, is it really insignificant? Facetime for 3g is also disabled for some unexplainable reason.</p>
<p>And the lower resolution at twice the cost is a ridiculous claim? How about last gen internals then? :)</p>
<p>But the iPad 2 already didn&#8217;t have Siri.  So I guess since people have used it with iOS 5 &#8220;Light&#8221; they won&#8217;t exactly think iOS 6 is any &#8220;lighter&#8221;? :)</p>
<p>I bet the last generation internals can keep up with this tablet in just about anything and will power software that just won&#8217;t be available for this tablet for quite a while.</p>
<blockquote>But the iPad 2 already didn’t have Siri. So I guess since people have used it with iOS 5 "Light" they won’t exactly think iOS 6 is any "lighter"? :)<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>We are talking about <i>new&lt;/&gt; devices here. People might not quite understand why one iPad gets Siri, but not the new one they bought, just because it was cheaper.</i></p>
<p>The last sentence is , to be fair, pure guessing/wishing from your part.</p></blockquote>
<p>I ¤&amp;&quot;#&amp;%# hate this lack of edit. :)</p>
<p>Let me help you then:</p>
<p>I fucking hate this lack of edit. :)</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>I think people are pretty prepared to understand that buying a cheap device in a given product line has fewer features than the more expensive one :)</p>
<blockquote>I think people are pretty prepared to understand that buying a cheap device in a given product line has fewer features than the more expensive one :)</blockquote>
<p>Not when in every other computing ecosystem where those features are a result of software.</p>
<p>When it is software, you expect to be able to upgrade to the better features down the line.  There is no reason the iPad 2 can&#8217;t run Siri or Facetime 3G.  The buyers should in fact be able to purchase those apps.  In every other computing environment this is considered normal.</p>
<p>Apple is continuing their alienation of value conscious buyers by crippling their own products.  I had hoped that Mr. Cook would get rid of that attitude at Apple following Jobs&#8217; death.  Unfortunately this has not been the case.  Growing up in the 80&#8217;s I saw that attitude which permanently turned me off from Apple back then.  It is actually a bit of a surprise to me that Apple&#8217;s company character has not improved, especially given their success.</p>
<p>The main difference will be that the iPad 2 as a crazy abundance of tablet apps, and the Nexus 7 doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The iPad 2 gets almost every iOS 6 feature, including Flyover.</p>
<p>Too bad it&#8217;s still twice the price of the Nexus 7, which has a higher resolution and better chipset.</p>
<p>Your logic so far are good, but for general people.  BUT. Google OS is still better for me when I want to do more than just consuming content.  I say this as a owner of an iPad 3 and a Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Like Garageband or a full office suite, of which Google tablets have neither?</p>
<p>99% of ppl are fine with what Google docs provides.  Garageband? Niche at best</p>
<p>99% is a number you pulled out of your ass&#8230;</p>
<p>Much like what digitalbobby pulled out of his ass about not having a full office suite?</p>
<p>Heh, so it&#8217;s justified to lie when it suits your opinion eh? Regardless, he&#8217;s right, 99% is just pulled out of his ass. You&#8217;re right too, but the fact you attacked the one person that made a true statement shows you likely care more about your liar&#8217;s opinion than the truth.</p>
<p>So he provides an example of content creation, and you dismiss it because he&#8217;s right? Cool.</p>

<p>What were you saying again? Do we need to bring up that Google Docs now has offline editing enabled?</p>
<p>Those are all clunky. In fact, Polaris is probably the best, and it has nothing on Pages and co.</p>
<p>You have got to be joking. Polaris Office is a full MS Office compatible suite. Pages is just a pretty looking version of a rather primitive text editor like Wordpad.</p>
<p>Polaris office is lightyears ahead of Pages. It&#8217;s not even in the same league</p>
<p>Lol&#8230; have you even used the office equivalents on iOS?  They&#8217;re clunky, feature lacking,  pieces of crap.</p>

<p>Probably the best office app on Android.,</p>
<p>Since when does the iPad have full office suite? I assume you mean MS Office?</p>
<p>well&#8230; you can purchase the iWork apps (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) on the App Store.</p>
<p>Me and a lot of people I know who owns an iPad, didn&#8217;t get the Garageband and full office suite from Apple. I use my laptop for Office. iPad ain&#8217;t really designed for that. Maybe the Surface is. But not the iPad.</p>
<p>please shut up.</p>
<p>Perhaps. But it&#8217;s harder for me to share the iPad with my wife than to buy 2 of these and not have to worry about that.</p>
<p>At least you won&#8217;t have to worry about buying apps for either device, too, because there are none! ;)</p>
<p>Wrong. There are 600K apps in the the Play Store, and most of them would run in Nexus 7 just fine. Maybe most are not tablet optimized, but it will run. And it won&#8217;t look like the iPhone Apps in the middle of your iPad screen. You just don&#8217;t have any idea.</p>
<p>I have close to 100 apps on my iPad and there&#8217;s only one app that doesn&#8217;t have an iPad version: Speedtest.net. Running it on iPad gives me an app with tiny black borders around the edges. It&#8217;s annoying, but no big deal for the few instances I need to use it.</p>
<p>The point is that there&#8217;s almost no apps that AREN&#8217;T tablet optimized for iPad. On Android, it&#8217;s the opposite.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s got Chrome, the best browser out there (citation needed)!</p>
<p>Not trying to get into the middle of the circle-jerk, but so does iOS now.</p>
<p>We now return you to your regularly scheduled platform flame-war&#8230;.</p>
<p>How many times can the same comment be said by the same person in the same thread? Thank you, Shenmue.  Reading it this time made it perfectly clear, finally.</p>
<p>What&#8217;cha hiding from your wife? ;)</p>
<p>You should buy an iPad and then place it on your altar.</p>
<p>The $400 iPad2 has half the RAM, less than half the CPU speed and a lower display resolution for twice the price.<br />
Unless you are an Apple fanboy, it isn&#8217;t worth it at all.</p>
<p>iOS is less resource intensive than Android. That means it needs less battery-draining RAM and CPU to eke out the same performance. And it has perhaps a hundred times as many tablet optimized apps as Android. I&#8217;m not trolling, but to say the iPad 2 isn&#8217;t worth its price is silly. It&#8217;s the cheapest way to get access to the iOS tablet ecosystem.</p>
<p>When $400 is the cheapest way to an ecosystem, you know you&#8217;re in the wrong ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tuan X: If you want to spend $400 for a slow tablet go ahead.  If you want something fast and will respond when you touch it. I will buy this tablet at half the price.</p>
<p>How would a tablet that is twice as much with a lower resolution screen and a slower processor/gpu be a better device to buy? I fail to understand your logic. If you just want a tablet for web browsing, media consumption, and reading (which are the main reasons an average consumer buys a tablet), then why would saving $200 dollars and getting a more feature-rich tablet be a bad idea? Please enlighten us.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t you heard? There are millions of tablet apps on the App store and only one on the Play Store. Obviously it is impossible to develop tablet apps for Android, it has nothing to do with the fact that the worst offenders have hundreds of terrible programmers and designers.</p>
<p>Shut up dude. I own an iPhone and a MBP but I&#8217;d be the first to admit that you&#8217;re a fucking troll.</p>
<p>Price is independent of it&#8217;s usefulness.</p>
<p>nobody argues on that. but, still, in this world, money matter. I am a apple &#8220;guy&#8221; with MBpro and iPhone, but I (I mean, &#8220;I&#8221;, not &#8220;everyone&#8221;) have no use for a $500 tablet, as I would use it only for browsing / mail and as reader, so the app portfolio is no issue for me. The nature of my work forces me to stick with a &#8220;PC era&#8221; device. but I can see the benefits of a much more portable 7&#8217; cheap tablet with very solid specs.</p>
<p>so it is individual, for me. a &#8220;worse&#8221; $200 device is actually better than the &#8220;better&#8221; iPad, because I simply have no use for it (tried it).</p>
<p>there is no overall &#8220;winner&#8221; and price does matter a lot, especially with such comparable specs.</p>
<p>Great, and a Honda Accord isnt better than a BMW 535i. Doesnt mean that the honda is probably a very smart decision for a lot of buyers</p>
<p>Except in this case of your poor attempt at an analogy the Honda is faster, has a nicer engine/interior and drives better. The only thing is you can&#8217;t brag to your friends about your Ipad&#8230; I mean your BMW.</p>
<p>@Tuan X &#8212; Firstly, it&#8217;s pretty hard to base your arguments on hypotheticals.  Secondly, It&#8217;s a bit ridiculous to compare a $500 tablet to a $200 tablet.  It&#8217;s like comparing a Kia to a Lexus, BMW, etc. and saying &#8220;The Lexus has more options, a better interior, etc. than the Kia.&#8221;  DUH! It costs 2.5x more, and when something costs more, people typically expect more as well.  Very weak argument my friend&#8230;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about the ecosystem, however, which is far more fleshed out on iOS.  Not hardware features, software.  And you&#8217;re totally missing that.</p>
<p>Comparisons between this and the iPad are inevitable, but in all honesty that&#8217;s not really fair.</p>
<p>They have completely different form factors and are in completely different price brackets.</p>
<p>As for the whole tablet app vs phone app thing, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s so big of a deal either. This tablet is not that much bigger than any of the android phones, I&#8217;m sure flipboard looks great on it, netflix looks great on it, chrome looks great on it, gmail looks great. I don&#8217;t know about you but that&#8217;s really what I want a tablet for. I have a laptop if I need anything more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not competing with the iPad. Yes it&#8217;s an Android tablet, but it&#8217;s competing with the Kindle Fire, hence the low amount of storage and emphasis on getting/streaming everything from Google Play/Cloud; just as the Kindle Fire does with Instant Video and eBooks and the like.</p>
<p>&#8220;IN IT&#8217;S WHOLE.&#8221; is what you said. price would be considered in this. gNex 7 wins, handily.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to argue with your opinion over whether it&#8217;s better or not&#8230;but to say it wins handily shows some heavy bias.</p>
<p>the iPad is just better in terms of Screen resolution, Apps and maybe a better build quality. Definitely not the OS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an iPad user only because of the Apps. But there are a lot of things that my Nexus S is better.</p>
<p>simple examples: <br />
1. When I want to share a URL, other than to Twitter&#8230;how would I do that in iOS? How much easier is it to do in Android? You probably don&#8217;t know don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;m in the photo gallery app of my device and finds a photo that I would like to edit in a third party app or share to Instagram, how would I do that in iOS? How easy would it be to do in Android? You also probably don&#8217;t have an idea don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>1. Copy the URL. iOS6 does FB integration.<br />
2. Open the editing app, and wow! Look at all of your photos right there, ready for editing!</p>
<p>iOS 6 won&#8217;t even be available till October if last year is any indication.</p>
<p>1. No. In iOS &#8212; From the browser, it&#8217;s copy the URL. Home button or &#8220;switch App gesture&#8221;. Open the other App. Paste the URL. Then Share. Home again or &#8220;switch App gesture&#8221;. Back to browser and continue reading.</p>
<p>In Android &#8212; From the browser, hit share, select which app you want to share it, done. You&#8217;re still in the browser, continue reading.</p>
<p>Also, in Android FB integration and other Apps  integration have been there since forever. So iOS6 what&#8217;s to get too excited about that.</p>
<p>2. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re in editing app already, not from the photo gallery app when you suddenly find a photo that you&#8217;d want to share. <br />
Well, in Android &#8212; it&#8217;s just as easy as Number 1.</p>
<p>As a whole, regardless of price, the iPad would be a better  device. But that&#8217;s not a valid argument b/c ultimately price is a huge factor in consumer choice. So comparing a $500 device against a $200 one isn&#8217;t a very effective argument.</p>
<p>For people with a ton of money, they can buy an iPad. Or hell, pick up both. For the rest of us, there&#8217;s now a valid offering in the $200 price range in the form of the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>and a Ferrari is better than a Civic.</p>
<p>But in this case the Civic is faster than the Ferrari, has a nicer engine/interior and drives better. You just can&#8217;t brag to your friends about your Ipad&#8230; I mean Ferrari.</p>
<p>That is entirely dependent on what you plan to use it for, is it not?<br />
For $200 if you get the same functionality that you as a user would get from an iPad, at a much reduced price, then for an individual it can be better than an iPad.</p>
<p>iPad 3 starts at $399.</p>
<p>On what planet?</p>
<p>hmm. I goofed.</p>
<p>what&#8217;s an iPad 3?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no such thing.</p>
<p>Is so.  I just bought mine a couple months ago.  Sweet screen, too ;-)</p>
<p>technically no. According to apple it is &#8220;The iPad.&#8221; or New iPad. NOT iPad 3.</p>
<p><img src="http://i306.photobucket.com/albums/nn266/nhatural/ipad.png" /></p>
<p>Thanks. Dunno what I was smoking.</p>
<p>iPad 2 is for sale at $399.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s where I tripped up.</p>

<p>but he has a point, if people are comparing &#8216;specs&#8217; then spec for spec iPad would seem to be better consider google in selling this at a 0% profit margin.</p>
<p>That is a LUDICROUS argument. Apple is a hardware company, first and foremost. In terms of revenue, the hardware makes up almost their entire revenue pie. Google is a SERVICES company. Google&#8217;s not really that vested in hardware. Google can basically care less about making money off the hardware. Why? Because it&#8217;s not their core business. Their core business is to track users and making a TON of money from that tracked user data. Google&#8217;s point with the Nexus 7 is to gain a larger user base, pure and simple., The larger their user base, the larger their revenue stream from selling user tracking data.</p>
<p>Basically two completely different types of businesses. Do you think Google doesn&#8217;t care about ridiculous margins? Google cares DEARLY about ridiculously high margins except for Google, the margin is in the business of selling the data they get from tracking the user. It&#8217;s just like Microsoft, Microsoft could care less about making money from hardware. Heck, the whole point of Surface for Microsoft is to bring out a great product to support their upcoming Windows 8 in which competitors will finally have to compete with a QUALITY piece of hardware rather than sitting on their toosh churning out generic and badly designed pieces of hardware over and over again just because it&#8217;s easy and comfortable.</p>
<p>Fantastic. Completely agree, People need to think about business strategy. Additionally, Google is entering the tablet market late, and being a loss leader much wiser than using a premium pricing strategy right now.</p>
<p>Late? The market has only just opened. Apple might be on their 3rd gen device, but no one had released a serious competitor to the iPad till 18 months ago. Apple were early, they ignited the market for these devices!</p>
<p>The tablet market is barely born!</p>
<p>&#8220;Google can basically care less about making money off the hardware.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, so they are able to care less, which means they do care. Got it.</p>
<p>That read just as Stewie would say it.</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />
Using &#8220;Could care less&#8221; and &#8220;never fails to disappoint&#8221; are instant indicators of some serious fails in logical thinking.</p>
<p>It tends to be an international difference. We Brits tend to use &#8220;couldn&#8217;t care less&#8221;  whereas in the states I see a lot more people writing &#8220;could care less&#8221;, intending to mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Oh certainly. They might intend to communicate the same thing, but they&#8217;re actually communicating the exact opposite, which is why its a a logical fail in misunderstanding both syntax AND irony.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Americans are idiots that don&#8217;t understand grammar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, smart Americans don&#8217;t say dumb things like &#8220;could care less&#8221; because they understand the implication of the combination of words instead of just thinking it&#8217;s an idiom that makes no sense other than that everyone else gets you.</p>
<p>Google is not a SERVICES company, Google is an ADVERTISING company.</p>
<p>well, advertising is a service.</p>
<p>by that logic Apple is a phone company</p>
<p>No, they are a computer hardware company. You know, you are what you earn money from.</p>
<p>yes most of their revenue is from iPhone/iPad</p>
<p>Indeed.  The Nexus line is not intended to suceed in terms of making money of hardware. It&#8217;s intended as a look guys, this is what a good peice of android hardware is. Now please make ones similar or better and sell our services for us. And if you don&#8217;t, people will buy ours.</p>
<blockquote> the margin is in the business of selling the data they get from tracking the user.</blockquote>
<p>For the umpteenth time, they do NOT sell your data to advertisers.</p>
<p>But overall, good comment.</p>
<p>They do, just not packaged directly.</p>
<p>No, they don&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t sell personal data. What they sell is analytic data (i.e. &#8220;people of age X who live in city Y might be interested in product Z&#8221;). They sell statistics, which are based on personal data, but not the personal data itself.</p>
<p>lol, &#8220;they sell personal data, but not the personal data itself&#8221;</p>
<p>Makes a lot of sense&#8230;.</p>
<p>They sell personal data, whether it&#8217;s the statistics they&#8217;ve gained by using the personal data gathered or not, it&#8217;s still the sale of personal data.</p>
<p>I agree that the Nexus 7 is certainly no iPad. But for someone who&#8217;s willing to try something that&#8217;s not iOS (Yes, some people don&#8217;t like iPads) and can&#8217;t afford a $400-$500 price tag, the Nexus 7 is a great choice and probably the best non iOS tablet around. <br />
It was not meant to compete against the iPad. but the Kindle Fire. Although if Google comes out with a 10 inch tablet that runs as smooth as this one and with a lot more content and apps designed for it, I would argue that it could easily match the iPad.</p>
<p>Hell, even for people who want to use iOS, if they can&#8217;t afford the iPad, then the Nexus is a better deal. Until there&#8217;s an iPad that costs $200, people who can&#8217;t afford it will be drawn to less expensive options. Particularly when said less expensive option offers most of the features of the iPad anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making that sacrifice&#8221; = &#8220;knows the only way to sell this beyond those of us predisposed to it  is to undercut on price&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not sure if it is a matter of sacrifice. As a traded company, Google has to make a profit. I think Asus is making a profit on the device, while Google will make a profit on selling content. Asus did the best hardware they could for that price.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to sell at slim margins when you can save on R&amp;D costs by imitating your competitors&#8217; innovations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re about equal in the bang for buck barometer.</p>
<p>Verge will compare Nexus 7 to other 10 inch tablets, but not the ipad. I think its just to keep you apple fan-boys happy, but the lack of a head to head speaks volumes.</p>
<p>The reason it&#8217;s cheap because Google isn&#8217;t paying for patents. Nokia will sue first and Apple will do the same.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not meant to compete with the ipad &#8211; so this entire argument is specious.</p>
<p>Always humorous because the iPad is a giant iPod touch, in reality.</p>
<p>And this is a slightly bigger Galaxy Nexus. What&#8217;s your point?</p>
<p>No. Not at all.</p>
<p>How not? It&#8217;s not even really a resolution bump! This is almost to the Galaxy Nexus as the first Galaxy Tab was to the Galaxy S phones&#8230; Well, no, those had far more in common. But it&#8217;s still more comparable than the iPad to iPod touch thing, which is overdone. Especially since the retina display bump on the iPad.</p>
<p>Other than size, how does the iPad differ from the iPod Touch?</p>
<p>There are several things I can do on my Galaxy Nexus that I won&#8217;t be able to do with the Nexus 7. Would you say that the iPad is just a larger iPhone?</p>
<p>No because the iPad runs hundreds of thousands of Apps that the iPhone doesn&#8217;t, that are built from the ground up to run on a 10&quot; screen. The Nexus 7 on the other hand runs standard Android phone apps.</p>
<p>Much as the iPad is a giant iPod touch, yes, this is a giant galaxy nexus.</p>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t. And if you believe that than all android tablets are big android phones. Especially now with jelly bean</p>
<p>I own the iPad 3 and I must say it is literally a big iPod touch which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. It&#8217;s just ironic that Android is now getting crushed for having &#8220;just a bigger phone&#8221; OS on there. If the experience is great (like the iPad) why get bent over it?</p>
<p>Form factor wise, yes.<br />
However, functionality wise. No.<br />
The real estate alone on the screen is enough to differentiate it, and the apps that are develop to use that extra space are testament to that.</p>
<p>Try Spotify for iPod Touch/iPhone then try the iPad version and you can instantly see the benefits.</p>
<p>Try a music listening app to determine how beneficial tablet apps are vs phone apps?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Tuan X:<br />
This is not a Galaxy Nexus with new software.<br />
My Galaxy Nexus does not have a quad core Tegra3.<br />
My Galaxy Nexus screen definitely is not scratch resistant.<br />
Updated Software and an updated OS are different things, this has both.<br />
The OS updates coming directly from Google on this one (no carrier or OEM to delay things), means this will be getting a new OS every six months for at least 18 months.  My VZW LTE Galaxy Nexus won&#8217;t be updated nearly as quickly.</p>
<p>You are correct it is not an iPad. But, my new iPad (3rd gen) has its own set of issues.  The retina display is more pixels than the GPU can handle readily. Any creative app (Sketchbook Ink. etc) is extremely laggy when trying to use.</p>
<p>ON POINT!</p>
<p>actually, btw, Verizon GNex got Jelly Bean yesterday, and it is awesome =]</p>
<p>i think he means an OT update not XDA ;)</p>
<p>Actually, The Verizon Galaxy Nexus got a ROM rolled from a preview release  OTA&#8217;d to devices given away at Google IO. Then people worked to get LTE, and also WiFi issue resolved.</p>
<p>JB hasn&#8217;t been released to the public,  and the ROM you mentioned is far from official.  That being said, it is awesome in many directions. Fast, responsive, Google Now is surprisingly useful. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Consider me shocked if Verizon actually releases this to the Xoom, and to the LTE GNex anytime soon.</p>
<p>Google says they will have it ready to roll out by mid-July, who knows when Verizon will push it OTA.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the RAZR or RAZR Maxx get this before the GN.  Considering those both have plenty of proprietary and skinned changes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll never see JB on the RAZR, we&#8217;re lucky it&#8217;s getting ICS,  just ask Droid 3 owners.</p>
<p>Preach on, brother. I own both as well and can say each one has it&#8217;s pros and cons, just like anything else.</p>
<p>my dear fellow, we all get it, you are a &#8220;connoisseur&#8221; of finer things and we all apreciate your enduring admiration for iThings, but please don&#8217;t leave 201 comments like a douchebag, ok? Thank you.</p>
<p>It it was, then Apple might as well pack up and stop selling iPads for the duration of the year. For 200$ there are limitations on how much value you can get, even if its ridiculously good.</p>
<p>Lol, Mr Fanboy, how is the iPad not just a blown up iPhone? infact every review of the iPad when it was launched, their biggest complaint was that it was no different than the iPhone except for a bigger screen</p>
<p>Oh because there haven&#8217;t been 200,000 apps specifically designed to use the real estate the iPad provides since that has there&#8230; <strong>facepalm</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t throw that bollocks reasoning around when accusing people of being FanBoys. Pot, kettle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big Galaxy Nexus with updated software&#8230;. and the ipad is a big iphone with some upgrades&#8230;</p>
<p>You know, the iPad was knocked at release for being nothing more than a big iPod touch&#8230;so if that is the worst criticism of the Nexus 7, then I think the Nexus 7 is on the right path.</p>
<p>and the ajipad is a big itouch so what´s Up!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re hating man, I agree with you. I am excitingly waiting for Nexus 7 to arrive to my house, but I have no plans to ditch my iPad with LTE, the content for it is just to rich. It seems people think that all developers do is target the apps for the screens size but that is not the case. They get to experiment more and play around with the U.I., gestures and insert different technology to their apps that just couldn&#8217;t be possible on a phone. This makes the iPad apps a much more engaging experience and different from the very same apps available on the phone version.</p>
<p>So why did I get a Nexus 7? Well, I do love iOS and always will. I also have a soft spot for Android as well Windows Phone and most likely always will and I want to see how Project Butter improved things and I really need a small tablet just to take to the couch and to the can with me that is better than the Kindle Fire and this is it.   I would have just waited for Jelly Bean on Gnexus but the screen shattered recently and I sold it as is. I also hope HTC is making the next Nexus, but I could live with a Motorola Nexus as well. Man 2012-2013 might be an expensive year for me.. Next iPhone (iPhone 4s resell value take care most of that cost), Next Nexus (as long as it is not Samsung again) And maybe a beefy Windows Phone.</p>
<p>I guess you forgot the iPad is just a big iTouch&#8230;</p>
<p>Well the iPad was a bigger iPhone with updates software and hardware&#8230; Just saying. Lol.</p>
<p>Remember when everyone said the iPad was a large iPod? Funny how things never change. <br />
<blockquote>I’m not hating, it’s just not that amazing. It’s big Galaxy Nexus with updated software. A cool device but it’s just not better than the iPad.</blockquote></p>
<p>The exact same thing was said about the iPad when it was announced / released. It&#8217;s just a giant iPhone&#8230;</p>
<p>Taking this, &#8220;I’m not hating, it’s just not that amazing. It’s big Galaxy Nexus with updated software. A cool device but it’s just not better than the iPad.&#8221;</p>
<p>And saying this about the iPad, &#8220;I’m not hating, it’s just not that amazing. It’s big iPod with updated software. A cool device but it’s just not better than the Nexus 7.&#8221;</p>
<p>It really is amazing considering the price of it. It isn&#8217;t trying to be better than the iPad. It&#8217;s showing what you can get for a fraction of what you would pay for an iPad. I own an iPad 2 and still preordered the Nexus 7. I&#8217;m taken with the idea of a 7 inch tablet plus I was won over by seeing some of the games that were tailored specifically for Tegra 3 that actually look better than those on the A5x.</p>
<p>And so is Ipad a larger version on Itouch&#8230;</p>
<p>looks like you&#8217;re pretty well versed. I suppose you accidentally left out the tablet&#8217;s quad-core processors, outstanding battery life, and a high-resolution display. I suppose the premium-feel and portability of the tablet counts for nothing. I&#8217;m sorry, but keep buying your iDevices and be stuck in your Apple bubble. Not hatin&#8217;, just saying.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t compare the two. But what I can tell you is, if Apple made a 7&quot; iPad, it would not even come close to this.</p>
<p>I can also tell you that if Google releases a 10&quot; Nexus tablet, it will be much better than the iPad.</p>
<p>And stop the &#8220;lack of apps&#8221; myth already. Android has more than enough tablet apps &#8211; just because there&#8217;s (unfortunately) no special section in the Play store, that doesn&#8217;t mean those tens or hundreds of thousands of tablet optimized apps aren&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>Congrats, you responded to his ridiculous claim with your own.</p>
<p>Of course you can compare the two. It&#8217;s a tablet. I believe the reason they created a 7&quot; version &amp; not a 10&quot; was because they  knew they&#8217;d be directly compared to the iPad if they did. They chose to target easy tablets to best (The Fire &amp; Nook), &amp; they did best them. But it&#8217;s simply NOT better than an iPad, yet. It needs a better dedicated App selection, a better screen, better battery life &amp; a lot more content. It&#8217;s marketed as a media consumption device specifically to avoid comparison to the iPad which is just as much content creation as it is media consumption.</p>
<p>They created a 7&quot; as that&#8217;s where the opportunity is. The Kindle Fire proved that.</p>
<p> A 10&quot; would be a whole different headache and unnecessary for what this device is bringing to the table in terms of features, software and ecosystem.</p>
<p>I agree. I don&#8217;t think Google is ready to be compared to an iPad yet. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think they bothered with a 10 yet.</p>
<p>Google wants to wrestle back lost market share from the Kindle Fire, which used a forked version of Android.</p>
<p>The Kindle Fire didn&#8217;t really prove much of anything.</p>
<p>How has it not proven anything? There&#8217;s large demand for a 7&quot; tablet and the Kindle sales have proven that.</p>
<p>Well given the fact most people have to budget for things and like things cheap and Amazon is a huge brand with TV ads and the largest marketplace on the Internet it was easy to get it in front of billions of people world wide. They also even had retailer partnerships for it and a consumer base from it Kindles, a brand people already trusted. They had a strong presences that help sell the device.</p>
<p>Google has the brand thing down, but they also need to promote it online and offline as well get it into some stores. I doubt really anyone outside of the geek circle really has a clue to what it is at this point unlike the Kindle Fire.  Google would be smart to partner with Verizon and a Hotspot device for it like Apple did with the original iPad at the very least that way it is opened up to a bigger consumer base and faster.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever read so much that was true yet such utter bullshit at the same time.</p>
<p>People can&#8217;t like the Kindle Fire better than the iPad? They would <i>ONLY</i> buy a Fire tablet if they are budgeting or too stupid to shop around?</p>
<p>God damn that&#8217;s some serious fanboy logic you&#8217;ve got going there.</p>
<p>It became the hottest selling Android based tablet, didn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s a pretty ignorant statement.</p>
<p>Exactly. There is a big market for 7 inch tablets.<br />
There are two markets for tablets.<br />
The 7 inch market and the iPad.</p>
<p>Amazon had quite impressive sales of the Kindle Fire at the end of last year.  Along with that, they managed to cut Google completely out of the application market by releasing their own application store.</p>
<p>Long story short, it seems like a sensible move to go after them, to avoid a fragmented ecosystem run by every device manufacturer and cellular provider.  I&#8217;m sure direct iPad/Nexus competition will happen, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like a focus.</p>
<p>any % of market share for android tablet is a competition with iPad. they all fight in the same ring, but google is clever enough to figure out it is more easy to first &#8220;take over&#8221; the 7&#8217; market as apple is not there yet. it is much simpler for now to build the nexus brand and lure more android tablet app devs there first and then, with some solid base, to attack iPad directly with an 10&#8217; nexus.</p>
<p>from what we know, I think one day google will take over this market just as they did at the smartphone market. at this point, the competition is ONLY about the content, the OS is just as good as iOS and they actually can push better specs devices for less money. to me, it is a matter of time. on the other hand, apple is less and less flexible in development, as it is tied down by the success of iPad. google has nothing to loose and the hunger for experimentation is evident. I used to take the android as iOS rip off, but I think this year is the turning point and android is getting better, more dynamic and with more and more of original ideas. yes, samsung is ripping off heavily, but google is at least truing to do it&#8217;s own things and many of them are maybe half baked, but impressive in concept.</p>
<p>A 7 foot and 10 foot tablet would be cumbersome&#8230;</p>
<p>Microsoft sold something like that under the name &#8220;Surface&#8221; :) It&#8217;s now called something different.</p>
<p>A flyweight and a heavyweight fight in the same ring but no one thinks they are fighting against each other&#8230;</p>
<p>Reality Check.  There is one tablet market, with a finite amount of dollars consumers have to spend in it.   Every sale of one tablet not only takes away from another&#8217;s sale of one tablet&#8230;it also takes away a customer for the foreseeable future as the vast majority  will likely never leave the competitors ecosystem.  Therefore, anyone attempting to claim they don&#8217;t care about a subset of that easily scaleable tablet  market,   are ignorant of reality (posters) or putting on a Public Relation stunt until they enter it under guise of not entering it (Apple, reduced price of ipad 2).</p>
<p>In addition, getting a foothold in 7&quot; is hugely important for when a 10&quot; nexus is released and when such 7&quot; users go to buy their next tablet.</p>
<p>Which leads to my next point in resposne to everyone who has posted it or is even thinking it&#8230; no one is likely to switch once they begin down the ios or Android path, so spare us of all the irrelevant statements implying the competitor&#8217;s os is just not good enough for you to switch.  This is a fight for those new to the ecosystems-first time purchasers.</p>
<p>This is such a ridiculous argument you&#8217;re trying to uphold. Are you going to tell me you can compare a $20,000 Toyota to a $50,000 Lexus? Of course you can, but can you tell me it&#8217;s a fair comparison? <em>They&#8217;re both cars</em>, just like the Nexus 7 and iPad. A $200 tablet requires sacrifices, which in this case are the screen and battery.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s different? They target different niches in the market, and in this case, a niche where there was more opportunity. Perhaps an iPad 2 is the better purchase, but you&#8217;ll get 2 decent media consumption devices for that price.</p>
<p>Wait, what? I can&#8217;t get a Porsche GT3 for Honda Civic money???</p>
<p>At the end of the day, both cars still get you from point A to point B.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not where you&#8217;re going, it&#8217;s how you get there.</p>
<p>The internet just looks better on an iPad when compared to an Android tablet. Don&#8217;t you know? The roads just look better when I&#8217;m in my STi instead of my sister&#8217;s plain old Impreza.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Road looks much better in my Evo compared to your STi /s</p>
<p>And at the same speeds with similar efficiency!</p>
<p>Or a Nissan Leaf to a Tesla Model S?</p>
<p>Are you gonna start comparing netbooks to gaming laptops as well?</p>
<blockquote>It needs a better dedicated App selection, a better screen, better battery life &amp; a lot more content.</blockquote>
<p>So&#8230; Does that statement make MacBook Pro with Retina display a laptop with a not good enough display?!?!?!?!<br />
Also it&#8217;s better than an iPad, simple because you can run 2 applications side by side at the same price!</p>
<p>Or you can look at it for what it really is.  It&#8217;s a 7 inch tablet that&#8217;s meant to usurp sales from the Kindle Fire.  Amazon is the only Android &#8216;OEM&#8217; that has managed to sidestep Google&#8217;s rules and it uses its own App Store to sidestep Google Play.  Why wouldn&#8217;t Google want to target that device?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not marketed as an iPad competitor because it isn&#8217;t one.  Google isn&#8217;t stupid.  There is no tablet that is an iPad &#8216;killer&#8217;.  Everyone knows that in the tablet space the iPad is king right now.  Google isn&#8217;t trying to take out the most popular tablet.  They&#8217;re trying to take out the most popular ANDROID tablet.  And the Nexus 7 is perfect for that IMO.</p>
<p>You can sit here all day and hoot and holler about how the iPad is better and how they didn&#8217;t make it 10 inches because they didn&#8217;t want to compete with it&#8230;but unless you&#8217;re completely nuts you have to understand that was never their intention.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>How do you &#8216;know&#8217; this? <br />
Are you a witch? Don&#8217;t come to our website with your black magic and devil worship. Be away with you.</p>
<p>Oh, can I have next week&#8217;s lottery numbers?</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a witch?&#8221;</p>
<p>I almost fell out of my chair.</p>
<p>What app store are you looking in?  And I can&#8217;t wait to see how many accessories will be avalible for this, probably close to none. And what happend to the update alliance they made such a big deal about last year. Good luck getting an update, nexus or not.</p>
<p>I get timely updates on my Galaxy Nexus. What exactly do you mean &#8220;good luck getting an update&#8221;?</p>
<p>The troll is strong with this one.</p>
<p>Nexus means updates direct from Google. You won&#8217;t need the update alliance to work.</p>
<p>talk about a reality distortion field.</p>
<p>TIL there are hundreds of thousands of tablet optimized apps for android. Why didn&#8217;t google just say so?</p>
<p>Oh that&#8217;s right, because there aren&#8217;t that many.</p>
<p>Assuming the rumoured 7&quot; iPad is based on the iPad 2, with the same resolution display and SoC, then on specs at least the Nexus 7 will completely blow it away. Far, far faster CPU/GPU, and a higher res screen. Plus more RAM too.</p>
<p>Then again iOS has far more tablet apps, but you have to offset that against the price of the Nexus, and the superiority of Android. I say that as an iOS user who is sick of Apple&#8217;s failure to do anything of note with iOS, &#8211; they seem only capable of ruining the UI with hideous skeumorphic design and of course, ripping out Google Maps to use their own vastly inferior maps.</p>
<p>The Nexus looks pretty damn tempting, and I don&#8217;t even need a tablet. (I have an iPad, and rarely use it)</p>
<p>Not to mention in a few months after this monster&#8217;s release the android ecosystem should be considerably buffed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll take more than months to match the Tablet App ecosystem of Apple. The Nexus 7 may blow away a 7 in iPad as far as screen resolution is concerned but it won&#8217;t in terms of software options &amp; hardware, I assume, will match that of the new iPad more-so than the iPad 2. Making it, in my opinion, still a better buy as it&#8217;ll have a lower price point as well.</p>
<p>Why do I hear that evey year?  It&#8217;s allways it&#8217;s comming, it will be better with the next update and so on. Keep up the faith maybe in 20 years you will have that. But not now or the near future.</p>
<p>Android has gotten leaps and bounds better. Or are you just blind to that fact?</p>
<p>And yes, it IS fact. ICS blows Gingerbread out of the water and Jelly Bean is even better than ICS.</p>
<p>I agree. JB is the first time I&#8217;ve looked at android and thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s as polished as iOS.&#8221;</p>
<p>I probably won&#8217;t be going full android, but I may save my pennies for a Nexus 7.</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s talking about Android tablet apps, which so far have failed to happen.</p>
<p>There actually is a ton of tablet optimized apps for Android. So yeah ,things really did change a lot.</p>
<p>I guess the benchmark app is Garage band. Which indeed is &#8220;missing&#8221; (or rather &#8220;not available&#8221;) on Android. Maybe Google should make something like that to get this nonsensical argument out of the way.</p>
<p>Not going to happen until google fixes their audio layer. Way too much latency.</p>
<p>Jellybean already takes care of that issue.  13ms latency for audio.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll wait and se on that, they said that with the Xoom, Transformer and tab 10.1.</p>
<p>None of those were released with Android 4.x which is leaps and bounds better than Android 2.x and 3.&#215;.</p>
<p>They said that about 3.0 when the Xoom was released.</p>
<p>And I experienced Android 3.0 which sucked. I have ICS on my Xoom and now Jelly Bean on my Galaxy Nexus and I can safely say it&#8217;s far better than Honeycomb.</p>
<p>Even Android users recognize that Honeycomb was a half-assed attempt at a tablet OS.</p>
<p>As Matias Duarte would call it, &#8220;it&#8217;s an emergency landing&#8221; OS. They needed to get something out&#8230;fast!</p>
<p>Android 3 on a tablet was leaps and bounds better than 2.x on a tablet.<br />
BUT Android 3 was the first version designed for actual tablet use!<br />
ICS and Jelly Bean are the first chance to make changes since this.<br />
People do realise that don&#8217;t they??!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly sure I&#8217;ve seen benchmarks that show the PowerVR GPU in the iPad to be &#8216;better&#8217; than the Tegra, the benchmarks presented here <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6054/google-nexus-7-mini-review" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6054/google-nexus-7-mini-review</a> appear to show this, but of course the software used to test could be completely skewed to the iPad.</p>
<p>Benchmarks do show speed and fillrate, which are generous on the new iPad no doubt.  What it fails to mention is how limited graphically the PowerVR chipset is in what it can render, while the tegra chipset has its roots in nvidia&#8217;s PC architecture so it has shaders and can run much more complex geometry.  Games play equally well on both, but the tegra 3 has more graphical flair and effects.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t kid yourself. The 7&quot; ipad, just like the iTV has been rumored for years. Just like the iPhone mini&#8230;and on and on and on.</p>
<p>These things will never happen. Stop trolling this article with such nonsense.</p>
<p>The iphone mini? You mean it can actually get a smaller screen than it has now?</p>
<p>Specs and performance are two different things.  Superiority of Android?  Stopping there.</p>
<p>Ok, so the whole point about iOS having more tablet optimized apps goes out the window if they scale back to a 7&quot; screen.  One major reason iOS Devs are able to optimize apps for tablets is because they only have 1 screen size to deal with.  Android however has a multitude of tablet sizes making app scaling and optimization more difficult.  If Apple busts out a 7 inch iPad they will have to either stretch iPhone apps, shrink iPad apps, or develop a specific version for the new 7&quot; screen.</p>
<p>Well then I guess its a good thing that it wasn&#8217;t intended to compete with the iPad huh?</p>
<p>i think this is a great tablet, it seems like google knocked it out of the park, unfortunately content is what makes a tablet and if you don&#8217;t have it it doesn&#8217;t matter how good your tablet is, the good news is that can all be fixed with time</p>
<p>huh? So your saying this tablet doesn&#8217;t have content???</p>
<p>What about Google Play? Movies, Music, TV Shows, Books, Magazines. <br />
What about Netflix and Hulu? They run on Android tablets. <br />
What about the Kindle and Nook Apps? They also run on Android. <br />
What about the Audible App? it runs on Android. <br />
What about podcast?<br />
What about 600,000 apps? <br />
What about a huge number of fantastic games?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t 2 years ago. Android has come a long way. Apps and games have come a long way.</p>
<p>God I really hate this about tech. People get these ideas in their heads early on, and it&#8217;s so hard to shake an idea once it&#8217;s formed. The idea that Android doesn&#8217;t have quality apps is completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>There is a ton of content available for this and all the other Android tablets. I think instant streaming is the only thing the Fire has over other tablets. But where Android is seriously lacking is in developer support, at least where tablets are concerned. I do think the Nexus 7 will go a long way to getting developers interested but there are other considerations, like the revenue model Google uses vs Apple&#8217;s. I would be surprised if the big guns, like Facebook, Twitter, etc aren&#8217;t already working on versions of their apps that take advantage of this form factor, but there are other touchstone apps and developers, like Flipboard, that need to move in and make the effort.</p>
<p>maybe i should have clarified, not as much content as the competition, also i can&#8217;t download google play content from germany (if there is a fix for this can anyone help?) so the ipad is a better solution for me (and torrent isn&#8217;t an option out here because they actually punish people with a fine in the mail, i have seen it first hand)</p>
<p>it has enough stuff to start. i t will grow by time.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a competitor to the iPad, nor is it intended as one. If Apple do produce a retina display sporting 7&quot; tablet (a form factor they have ridiculed) and it is competitive on price, then yes, it might be the better buy. Google are obviously trying to develop the Android tablet market with this release, the intention is to make the platform worth the developers&#8217; time. By all indications this could be the machine that does it for them. This is a very smart move.</p>
<p>its a completely different market, its a media consumption device, which the N7 is not</p>
<p>It depends on what the consumer needs.</p>
<p>I`m an Apple freak, there are two iPads in my house a 1 &amp; 2.<br />
Niether work for me as I want a tablet for lazing around surfing the net &amp; reading and they`re just too /bigheavy.</p>
<p>I`ve been waiting for a good quality 7&quot; tablet since the first iPad came out.<br />
I think this is the one.</p>
<p>Exactly why I ordered one.  The iPad is great.  It&#8217;s just not a great couch surfing/bed reading device.  This is.</p>
<p>one handed thing is what makes this right. i completely agree.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not aimed at the iPad. At all. It&#8217;s a $200, 7&quot; tablet. How could that possibly be construed as remotely comparable to the iPad, except in the minds of click-baiting tech writers?</p>
<p>This is a Kindle Fire competitor, and there it succeeds with flying colors. Any mention of the word &#8220;iPad&#8221; in a review of the Nexus 7 &#8212; particularly in the headline! &#8212; should immediately tell you that the article is not worth reading.</p>
<blockquote>if Apple comes out with a 7&quot; version of the iPad 2/3, I’d argue that it’d still be a better buy than the Nexus 7.</blockquote>
<p>It will also be twice the price, which would make it no competitor at all. It would be a different product aimed at a different user base.</p>
<p>You mean a different income bracket</p>
<p>You have no clue what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Sure the iPad&#8217;s better in many ways.  But the price is just not justifiable if you don&#8217;t have a use case that involves iPad productivity apps (I don&#8217;t mean Facebook&#8230;I mean Pages, Garage Band, etc.).  All those tablet apps are useless if you have no specific need for productivity apps on the iPad.  If you&#8217;re buying an iPad to browse and check Facebook, then the iPad really is a bigger iPod Touch for you.</p>
<p>250 000 apps.  Big deal.  I don&#8217;t have a quarter million bucks to spend on apps.  I care only about the apps I use regularly.  On a daily basis those apps are the browser, GMail, Maps, Flipboard, Pulse, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  And guess what?  These will work fine on this device.</p>
<p>Do I care that some aren&#8217;t optimized for tablets?  Not in the least.  As long as they are functional, it&#8217;s fine.  If functionality is as good as it is on my phone, what am I really missing out on?</p>
<p>The iPad&#8217;s size also comes with disadvantages.  Namely weight.  Try reading in bed with an iPad.  It sucks.  And how likely are you to really carry around an iPad compared to a smaller device like this?</p>
<p>None of this is to say the iPad is a terrible device.  It&#8217;s an amazing device.  But you really have to ask yourself if it&#8217;s worthwhile spending $500 if all you&#8217;re going to do is browse, read eBooks, watch movies, etc.  Different ballgame if you&#8217;re going to use iWork, iLife or other real tablet software.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still considering getting an iPad, cause it&#8217;ll integrate well with my iMac,  Apple TV, Airport and iPod.  But the Nexus 7 has effectively quelled the temptation for another year.  I can now wait for the iPad to hit the specs I actually want&#8230;.I was supremely annoyed that Apple gimped the new iPad with a VGA front facing camera.</p>
<p>As for Apple making a 7 incher, I&#8217;m not going to say never, but I can&#8217;t see it happening.  First, they&#8217;d be spitting on Jobs&#8217; grave.  Next, Apple is just not competitive in the shallow end of the pool.  Nothing wrong with that.  It&#8217;s just not in their DNA.  Asus has slim margins on this.  Google is selling at cost, hoping to get more profit from content.  If you think of Apple&#8217;s margins and the likelihood that Apple would offer a slightly better device (better casing, few missing hardware pieces, it would probably be $300.  The gulf between $200 and $300 is huge for consumers.  So it either won&#8217;t sell all that well, or would steal iPad 2 sales, or both.  A pointless proposition for Apple when they are selling every iPad they can make.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2/jtr.jpg" />I&#8217;m amazed by the engineering of this devide. <img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2fj/fvx.jpg" /></p>
<p>its $200. Holy fuck, and it&#8217;s been said and done, Google is no longer trying to compete. Also. No shit iPad is $500. You can buy 2 Nexus 7 for the price of 1 iPad.</p>
<p>True, it is hard to compete with apple especially when according to Hipster #1 @7:15 Google &#8220;makes youtube&#8221; thus their issue streaming HD content is odd.  This is a 1st party alternative to Amazon who has all the infrastructure it needs to eat away at some mountain view money.  They could really care less about supporting it, they just want to have something in place to make kindle folks on the fence go google instead of amazon and not even know they aren&#8217;t getting anything but skinned android, gingerbread none the less.  Doesn&#8217;t matter, fire&#8217;s sell and google wants an android OEM to get a piece of it.</p>
<p>You are comparing Apples with peaches son.. How on earth would you expect a 190 dollar device to be equal to or heck even better than an iPad that costs 300 bucks more?</p>
<p>Since it cost less than 1/3 the price, I don&#8217;t think you can compare them even in the slightest.  It&#8217;s a high quality tablet that hits a perfect price point for people looking for a tablet that don&#8217;t want or need a $600+ tablet.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it hilarious how every time there&#8217;s  a positive review of an Android product the Apple fanboys have to jump in and tell us how it&#8217;s still not as good as an iPhone/iPad etc? Frankly we don&#8217;t care! We&#8217;re here to read about the Nexus 7, not Crapple.  I bought a Nexus 7 and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Everyone who has seen it is impressed and many are seriously considering buying one. Personally I find Apple products to be way overpriced and incredibly boring. Your opinion here is completely pointless. If you want Apple that&#8217;s fine but we really don&#8217;t care that you think it&#8217;s better. Don&#8217;t go away mad, just go away.</p>
<p>That, and the lack of 4G is a deal killer for me. I don&#8217;t want to have to tether&#8230;</p>
<p>A well designed app shouldn&#8217;t be tablet centric. Look at Google+. That&#8217;s the ideal way to do it. But iOS users think that having to pay for an iPhone version AND an iPad version is a feature, when it is actually FRAGMENTATION.</p>
<p>is it just me or do gifs speed up the longer i look at them</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s just you.<br />
Go see a doctor ASAP.</p>
<p>You might be dying.</p>
<p>Same, I&#8217;m gonna get one despite already owning an iPad. I haven&#8217;t yet tried anything android flavour, so it will be nice to try it out.</p>
<p>I carried an iPad to and from work in my previous job and as much as I love the iPad I think a smaller tablet is much more convenient.  But I think I&#8217;ll wait to see Amazon&#8217;s response before I buy.</p>
<p>I think the only way for Amazon&#8217;s next offering to be relevant is for the OS to be built on Android 4.&#215;. Otherwise, no amount of hardware will warrant the purchase.</p>
<p>If they neuter the UI like they did with the Fire, the specs won&#8217; t matter much.</p>
<p>The screen resolution certainly matters.</p>
<p>I like that thought. I think the Nexus 7 will be my &#8216;out in public&#8217; tablet (if I like it). I&#8217;m always scared to lose, damage or have my expensive iPad stolen.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s response will still be a skinned tablet stripped of all it&#8217;s Googleness. And the Google stuff is the best part. It probably won&#8217;t have Jelly Bean and instead be based on ICS, and even so it will be so customized that ICS won&#8217;t even matter.</p>
<p>The fire won&#8217;t get things like Google Now and the new notifications. It won&#8217;t be a &#8220;complete tablet&#8221; the way the Nexus 7 is.</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think it matters what Amazon does, it won&#8217;t be better than this as long as they layer it with their own skin and subvert the heart of Android.</p>
<p>At this point, the KF is only relevant if you&#8217;re a hardcore Amazon fan.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the Kindle Fire 2 matches the Nexus 7 specs (I doubt it&#8230;) which should you get?</p>
<p>KF for maybe the discounted Prime membership.  But that&#8217;s it.  With the Kindle Fire you are locked into Amazon&#8217;s App Store.  And you&#8217;re stuck on their version of Gingerbread when in about a year (well shorter than the life of the device) most users will be on Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean and most developers will start coding apps and games at this level.</p>
<p>Get a Nexus 7 and you can just download the Amazon App Store and access Amazon content.  Yet, you&#8217;ll still get all the native Google Apps.  And you can access other content stores.  Win-Win.</p>
<p>If all things are equal I&#8217;ll get the Nexus, even if they arent&#8217; that equal.  I&#8217;ll get the KF only if it&#8217;s much better&#8230; nah fuck that, I bought my teen a KF and it kind of defeats the purpose of android.  Ok I&#8217;m getting this.</p>
<p>Man, Android adoption is totally rate is totally tied at the hip with two-year contracts, so unless something crazy happens like we&#8217;ve never seen before ICS wont be dominant until 2014. There&#8217;s a very dedicated and loud group of people who are early adopters but not enough to force a landslide change. I&#8217;m inclined to believe it&#8217;s got to do with the retail cycle. Not saying it wont be more present in a year, but just its just got off to real whimper of a start. Look at the wayback machine for comparable data: <a href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110801000000*/http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html" target="new">2010/2011 snapshots</a></p>
<p>You realise the KF2 is right around the corner don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Amazon Video. That&#8217;s the differentiation. The leaked .apks still don&#8217;t work on anything other than a fire.</p>
<p>I was thinking the exact same thing.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.. I think I&#8217;m gonna preorder this baby sometime this weekend.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly</p>
<p>Interesting times! Google owns the 7&quot; space, Apple has 9.7&quot; and Microsoft will probably nail 10.6&quot;.</p>
<p>pretty good assessment.</p>
<p>How do they own the 7 inch space with a tablet that isn&#8217;t even out yet? Must be all the other success they have had with other tablets.</p>
<p>Well, the Kindle IS built on Android and it is by FAR the most popular 7&quot; tablet available so by proxy Google does own the 7&quot; space.</p>
<p>So you know haw many fires have sold then?  You must have numbers to back that up?</p>

<p>Want more?</p>
<p>Do you have any article that also mentions wombats?</p>
<p>why do fools fall in love?</p>
<p>Sure.  How about actual sales numbers from Amazon?</p>
<p>What?  They&#8217;re not available?  So everyone is just guessing?  Yep.</p>
<p>Yes, everyone is just throwing out random numbers. It&#8217;s ok, you don&#8217;t have to believe it as long as the investors do.</p>
<p>HA!</p>
<p>9.7&quot; and 10.6&quot; are the same market.</p>
<p>Apple won&#8217;t make a 7&quot; tablet anyways.</p>
<p>1. They won&#8217;t sacrifice enough design and quality to get to $199<br />
2. They won&#8217;t sell something at a low enough profit margin to get to $199<br />
3. They hate adding new resolution support to their OS and only do it when they have to. (Although I suppose a 7&quot; at iPad 2 resolution would make sense)</p>
<p>They can make a premium one and charge more, people are always willing to pay more for apple.  the fans know with apple you get a premium product at a premium price.  And then there are those that will buy anything apple puts out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I see happening. Apple releases a 7&quot; iPad in the fall with the launch of the new iPhone. Same internals as the new iPad, and a retina display arround the same DPI as the iPad. It will probably replace the iPod touch, and will always trail the newest iPad as far as internals go, but it will always receive the features of the version of iOS released w/ the iPhone.</p>
<p>And it will start at $250 with $100 jumps for larger storage.</p>
<p>And they would also suddenly be directly compared to products like the Nexus 7. And comparing a great product at $199 to a great product at $299 or higher would usually end favorably to the cheaper product.</p>
<p>Not to mention that this is just silly. Apple will never release a 7&quot; tablet. Give it up. Stop talking about such nonsense that will never happen, has never even been remotely likely to happen.</p>
<p>The product at $299 comes with 250,000 apps while the $199 product has phone apps.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a new iPad for $299?</p>
<p>Phone AND tablet apps.</p>
<p>That is unless the 7 inch tablet market is a resounding success, and it results in a loss of sales for the 10&quot; iPad.</p>
<p>Would they really though?</p>
<p>If Apple makes a 7 inch tablet, it&#8217;s going to be at least $300.  It still won&#8217;t be competitive with this.  And it might cannibalize some higher margin iPad 2 sales.</p>
<p>Premium customers will just buy the iPad 2.</p>
<p>But this is where you&#8217;re wrong. Apple&#8217;s products aren&#8217;t &#8220;premium&#8221; in quality or specs, they&#8217;re &#8220;premium&#8221; only in their price.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t even make a laptop that could be compared to a PC laptop that&#8217;s half the price and twice the specs.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on their computers. They&#8217;re a complete joke compared to what you can put together in 10 minutes for 1/4th the price.</p>
<p>Yes of course, let me just go put together a laptop of the same quality and thinness of the MacBook Pro.. oh wait, I cant.</p>
<p>Yes Apple products cost a lot, but don&#8217;t be so silly, the build quality is amazing and nothing matches it. I wish I could find a PC manufacturer who made something remotely similar.</p>
<p>The products are premium in that they are made from excellent materials, the designs are superb and so is the detailing.</p>
<p>This is the same as in many other sectors &#8211; there are cheap and expensive options. The expensive options will tend to have much better materials/detailing etc.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to like or want Apple products, but dont be so silly as to suggest they are somhow the same as a plasticy cheap items, or that you can easily go buy a machine with the same build quality/</p>
<p>Then again people are different &#8211; you probably dont see why people like Mercedes/Porsche/Aston Martins, and think a souped up Astra is somehow the same</p>
<p>Well done Google. This is really a solid device and an amazing price &#8211; granted, it needs a little work, but don&#8217;t all products at launch?</p>
<p>If I weren&#8217;t so heavily invested in the Microsoft Ecosystem I&#8217;d hop on this! (I&#8217;m waiting on Windows 8 Devices :X)</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with your statement. I really hope Google pushes out a Nexus 10 next year though!</p>
<p>I agree, of course I would say let them, so Google can sure Apple like they sued Samsung. Seriously, the lawsuits they began against Samsung don&#8217;t have any teeth. Anyone remember the Prada came before the iPhone?</p>
<p>Your comment makes no sense.  Google hasn&#8217;t sued anybody, they were sued by Oracle and won.  Apple sued Samsung, and every other android manufacturer, probably hoping to stop android by proxy.</p>
<p>Oh joy. Another copycat tablet, just in time for the next round of patent-infringement summary judgements and preliminary injunctions. What will Google replicate next?</p>
<p>Full screen tablet and phone? Check. Smooth and responsive touchscreen software? We&#8217;re still working on that one. Hardware with an Apple look and feel? Sort of. Siri-like, female personal assistant with attitude for US voice search? Check, but we had to go with a sci-fi knock-off voice with less personality, fewer answers and more advertiser responses.</p>
<p>Inexpensive, AppleTV-like media box? Check, but it&#8217;s actually kind of pricey and looks more like a Magic 8 Ball. First-rate App Store and ecosystem? Um, hold on there, chief. Legendary Apple quality, desirability, tech support and customer sevice? Err, wait a second.</p>
<p>Google spyware that tracks every online activity, notifies advertisers and is &#8220;open&#8221; for hackers? Check. Check. Check.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get why most people just wouldn&#8217;t get an original &#8211; the Apple iPad or iPod Touch. In fact, I believe they will. And if Apple does release a 7-inch tablet in the fall, as rumored, I pity the developers and buyers who settle for this, or other knock-offs. This device may interest  Amazon cheapskates and Android geeks, but I can&#8217;t imagine it will motivate the masses, especially Apple buyers who expect the very best.</p>
<p>Finally, I also wonder why the Googlopoly is producing a smaller tablet that won&#8217;t fit into standard, double-DIN automotive dashboard openings. Why 7.85 inches? Why not 7 inches? Oh well, what&#8217;s another product or two that slightly misses a target market&#8230;</p>
<p>Hostile much?  Dude, chill.  Choice is good.  Anger is bad.  Be cool.  R-E-L-A-X.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Verge team is being generous to Android today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a $200 tablet that&#8217;s basically an Ipad without a 10&#8217;&#8217; screen.  I&#8217;d say that warrants some praise considering the price point of an Ipad.</p>
<p>Indeed, old chap. I&#8217;d say, I want one myself.</p>
<p>Holy magicarp, is this the first android tablet that has sccored a bigger number than 8?</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.videogum.com/files/2012/02/shocked3.gif" /></p>
<p>Well.. Second&#8230; <br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2601558/asus-eee-pad-transformer-prime-review" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2601558/asus-eee-pad-transformer-prime-review</a></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best score, they have given to a tablet ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing the new iPad at 9.3</p>
<p>Its amazing that the Nexus 7 scored an 8.8 despite scoring so low on the camera, battery life and ecosystem sections. If it would have had a good rear camera and a bigger battery that thing would have easily crossed the 9 mark. But on another note, Engadget has the battery on the Nexus 7 lasting the same as the iPad in their battery rundown test.</p>
<p>Overall scores they give are not an average, not even a weighted average.</p>
<p>Which is a great thing, because if it got a lower rating just because it didn&#8217;t have a back-facing camera&#8230; I&#8217;d be pretty ticked. Like Josh said, &quot; If you’re one of those people who likes to snap pics with their tablet — first, shame on you.&quot;</p>
<p>Camera should have been lower.</p>
<p>Why? It has a front-facing camera, which is the camera that matters.</p>
<p>Supposedly the battery life is over 9 hours. This is the thing with quick reviews like this. They don&#8217;t really get a good grasp of battery life. But the stated battery life is over 9 hours. That&#8217;s great for a 7&quot; tablet and right up there with the iPad.</p>
<p>The camera is a front facing camera. Intended for video chat and not for picture taking. So of course it&#8217;s not given much weight as I&#8217;m sure it does great for what it&#8217;s intended to do&#8230;.Video Skype, Google Talk Video messages, etc.</p>
<p>Verge rated the battery at 6 hours and Engadget around 8. Your milage may vary.</p>
<p>If you play video, the battery life will probably be well over 9 hours. For CPU intensive tasks like web browsing, the battery life is a lot shorter.</p>
<p>Except it&#8217;s BETTER than an iPad without a 10&quot; screen. Huzzah!</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t compare them with such different screen sizes. I&#8217;ve owned a 7&quot; and a 10&quot; tablet, I can tell you those are totally different things.</p>
<p>Would it be better than an iPad if they had the same screen size? Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Just add a 1080p or better display and raise the price point to 250$ for the 8Gb version and I&#8217;d say that is undeniably true, now that Android is such a mature operating system.</p>
<p>but then you could store one tv show, and run out of space&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a better screen would cost less than $50, thus giving Google a bigger margin and allowing for more storage. I mean 8 gigs of storage probably costs like $5 or less, so i can&#8217;t imagine it would be a problem.</p>
<p>Ah, such a naive view. For a start, panels of that density are harder to come by. Then you&#8217;re pushing the GPU harder &#8211; can it keep up? You&#8217;re pushing the battery harder &#8211; how do you balance battery life? What seems like a simple layman &#8220;just add a better screen with no consequences!&#8221; actually has a lot of effect on the entire device&#8217;s cost and design.</p>
<p>Just look at the iPad 3 for this in practice &#8211; The display is lovely, but it can&#8217;t game to the same visual quality as the iPad 2 and it takes twice as long to charge for the same run time.</p>
<p>Compromise is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Well the 3rd gen iPad can game with much better visual effects than the iPad 2 at iPad 2 resolution.  Just not with the same visual effects at 3rd gen iPad resolution :)</p>
<p>One of the reasons I&#8217;m buying the Nexus 7 and holding off for the next iPad.</p>
<p>True. Not naïve, just barely conscious 3AM haha<br />
I wish I didn&#8217;t agree. I JUST WANT A RETINA 7in TABLET, JEEZ.  ):</p>
<p>2013 Nexus 8 specs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not better than an iPad. It&#8217;s close, but not quite.</p>
<p>ipad isn&#8217;t quad core cpu&#8230;. its a DUAL core CPU with a QUAD CORE CPU. The nexus is a quad core CPU (really 5 cores) with a 12 core GPU!</p>
<p>Your CPU comparison has some merit as they are basically the same architecture.  It would be interesting to see which real world applications benefit &#8211; I haven&#8217;t seen it yet but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s out there somewhere?</p>
<p>Your GPU comparison is completely meaningless.  The 12 cores in the Tegra 3 are not as powerful as a quad core PowerVR SGX543MP4.  You can not just count cores across different architectures and make any kind of assumption about performance.  Counting transistors would be a step in a better direction.</p>
<p>You are discounting the architecture though, the tegra 3 is based off of nvidia&#8217;s pc line-up and thus comes with programmable shaders that the PowerVR lacks, so the tegra can actually have more effects with less effect on performance.<br />
The only real feather in the PowerVR&#8217;s hat is its ability to push pixels, the fill rate on it is very very high.  While the memory bandwidth is the limiting factor for tegra 3, which is why in the newer implementations it gets faster ram and has no trouble with the higher resolution of the transformer pad infinity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s basically an ipad without the 10&quot; screen <strong>or the 250,000 tablet specific apps</strong>.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s a kindle fire without the quality controlled amazon app store to keep the crappy, non tablet apps from showing up.</p>
<p>Tablet specific apps is a dumb idea. Apps should adapt to the full range of devices. As Duarte explains in the interview.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly annoying to have different apps for each device.</p>
<p>As a phone and tablet app developer, I disagree with you in part.</p>
<p>There are a certain number of my apps I just would not want people to run on their phones, because it would guarantee a worse experience (coding apps, painting apps, for example). And I wouldn&#8217;t want to be responsible for that poor user experience.</p>
<p>Also there is one game we have developed that can just not be played on a phone — as it requires four simultaneous touches with two hands. Anything lower than a 9&quot; screen for that game is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But for a large selection of apps (especially information consumption apps), having them run on both phone and tablet is a very good idea.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another matter. Sure you can restrict apps from being used on certain devices.</p>
<p>The point is that IF an app is supposed to run on the full range of devices, you should not have a different app for a small phone, big phone, 7&quot;tablet and then a 10&quot;tablet. One app should simply be able to work on all those. It should also work pretty much the same way on all these devices. Just use the extra screen real estate for combining functionality on a bigger screen.</p>
<p>Again I agree in part — I think the app should be the same for both tablet and phone devices (i.e. universal binary or whatever). But some apps need drastically re-designed UIs to work on a smaller (or larger) screen.</p>
<p>Look at Apple&#8217;s iPhoto, Keynote, and Numbers apps. They&#8217;ve re-imagined the workflow for them when they run on iPhone. It&#8217;s really good, and well thought out (I was amazed that Keynote was actually usable at phone size). These are very complicated applications, and they really need a lot of thought about how you approach them at different sizes. The tablet interface for iPhoto on a phone would be ridiculously cluttered and would just not work.</p>
<p>So for a lot of simpler apps, I agree with you — they can mostly preserve their form and show more content. But when you get to more advanced and complex interactions you start to need dedicated designs for different device forms.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say more content, but more functionality. Like showing a menu in a column on the left for a tablet device  (in landscape orientation!) and have the menu on a separate screen from the content on a phone.</p>
<p>True, though I think it goes a bit deeper than optional menus. Sometimes the app&#8217;s design needs to be started from scratch for an alternate form factor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done this a few times with the universal apps I&#8217;ve developed — I was able to reuse some code (individual views) but the best result came when I went back to the design stage and threw everything away. Then thought about how my users would approach the app on a different device, what emotions they would feel, how much time they would have, and so on.</p>
<p>So in the end you essentially design two apps that share some implementation code. I don&#8217;t think this is a bad way to do things, you end up creating a very focused experience on every device you support.</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Twitter on a phone works great with just a single column table view.  On a tablet (even 7&quot;) every tweet becomes only a single line long, and is a pain to read and looks ugly. Go to 10 inches and it is even worse.</p>
<p>Phone apps are designed with a single pane of content as that is about all you can fit. A tablet should have more than that.</p>
<p>Yes, so add more columns on a tablet. What&#8217;s your issue?</p>
<p>You are only correct in regards to apps that have both phone and tablet apps separately available, rather than unifying.</p>
<p>I was predicting the score would be 8.4, but I don&#8217;t think 8.8 is too high. It&#8217;s pretty incredible what you&#8217;re getting for the price. If they sell a lot of these which they likely will, there will be pressure for devs to get their Android apps working great on tablets.</p>
<p>If they sell a lot? <br />
I pre-ordered two just on the announcement. <br />
Google/Asus has hit a home run on this Tab.</p>
<p>Two isn&#8217;t a lot ;)</p>
<p>(yes, lots of people are excited, and I&#8217;ll probably buy at least 1 for my mom, but the verge could all buy 1 and it wouldn&#8217;t sell &#8220;a lot&#8221;. The metric these days is in the millions. Let&#8217;s not ramp the expectations too high, considering how little known success Google has had with their other Nexus devices.)</p>
<p>But with the phones there were other choices that were as good or better and cheaper.  This kicks every android tablets ass. anyone who&#8217;s been holding out will probably jump on this one. j</p>
<p>But most people probably won&#8217;t even know it exists.</p>
<p>In the video review, Josh browsed to the NYTimes, where there was a prominent ad for the Nexus 7. Not Apple-level marketing, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be at least some consumer awareness.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remember who makes all those advertisements you see on web pages appear&#8230; I think Google can make their tablet known.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus is one of the best phones available. It was the best phone at the time. Since it&#8217;s so much cheaper than the Galaxy SIII and One X, I&#8217;d say it still is the best option for most people buying a smartphone now.</p>
<p>Yet they aren&#8217;t selling much Galaxy Nexii. Or at least not nearly enough as they should be selling based on the merits of the device.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not accounting for the fact that there are no carrier restrictions or favorites being played against them now. All the previous nexus devices were pretty much ignored by carriers that were supposed to be selling them. I would bet that Google sells more nexus 7&#8217;s by Christmas than all nexus phones combined up to this point.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2/jtr.jpg" />Some apps scale fine from Android phones to tablets but having a developer specifically spend time to make those tablet apps perfect is what he means. You obviously have never compared iPad apps to Android tablet apps otherwise you would not be so defensive. <img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2fj/fvx.jpg" /></p>
<p>Google is giving him cash, so what&#8217;d you expect?</p>
<p>What&#8217;re we gonna do?!</p>
<p>Prepare for Android tablet domination</p>
<p><img src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs47/f/2009/226/8/f/MechWarrior_Mercs_Wallpaper_6_by_Mecha_Master.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m calling it now. 1.5 million activations by Christmas</p>
<p>Double that just in the US.</p>
<p>I think he means per day&#8230;</p>
<p>Has to.<br />
Kindle Fire did over a million in a short Christmas shopping window in the US alone.</p>
<p>This&#8217;ll blow that away. Although I expect Google &amp; Asus will keep the numbers close to their chest for competitive reasons.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll need a serious ad campaign to get more of these to the general public&#8230;  It&#8217;ll sell well through tech enthusiasts and word of mouth, but I hope Google can augment this with some quality advertising.</p>
<p>A singe, very popular android tablet other than the kindle fire can work wonders for the ecosystem this year.</p>
<p>They seem to have some bricks &amp; mortar deals arranged already and it&#8217;s only 48 hour old. You are right, they&#8217;ll need marketing, but am sure it&#8217;s coming.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a better advertisement than the front page of <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>? I&#8217;m betting it shows up there for a while</p>
<p>no they won&#8217;t. it&#8217;s not even a Google made product. But accepted that they can crush anyone&#8217;s marketing by having this on their home page, if they want to.</p>
<p>Apple and Google don&#8217;t build their products either, but this is a Google BRANDED product made by Asus for them.</p>
<p>To all intent and purpose this is a Google product.</p>
<p>Dude we&#8217;ve been preparing for this for years now, it&#8217;s getting kinda boring.</p>
<p>Hmm sorta on the ropes about the score. While the Android tablet ecosytem is improving I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s to point where the device can capture an 8.8. Other ecosystems don&#8217;t usually get this pass. Pretty good tab though especially for the price.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the ecosystem. The lack of tablet apps is a myth. The number of Android apps that are designed for tablets is huge.</p>
<p>I think 7&quot; is the size where both phone and tablet apps could work.</p>
<p>a dual panel for productivity apps like email, even though everything are too smushed and busy, it works. phone app like twitter, content a bit sparse, but it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s why google went with a 7&quot;er. It&#8217;s the 16:10 aspect ratio that makes me curious, I hate 16:9 including computer screens.</p>
<p>This write-up says otherwise.</p>
<p>The &#8220;lack of tablet apps&#8221; on Android is a bit overstated.  The Twitter app is always thrown out there but no one ever mentions the alternatives that <em>are</em> optimised for tablets (e.g. TweetCaster, Plume).</p>
<p>That said, the situation still needs to improve.  Between the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, there&#8217;s no excuse for developers not to optimize for tablets now.</p>
<p>The Twitter app is just one example, but it&#8217;s an important one. If you ask people about the things that people actually want to do on a tablet, they want simple things. Nobody cares about hundreds of thousands of apps; they want to read, browse the internet, check Facebook and Twitter, and they maybe want to play games. This tablet will do all those things, but the Facebook and Twitter apps suck, and iOS has better games. So, it&#8217;s really only good at 2 out of the 5 things that people actually want to do.</p>
<p>In games you can&#8217;t say it doesn&#8217;t have good games, particularly cos of it&#8217;s Tegra Chipset.</p>
<p>Chipset doesn&#8217;t matter if it has to run the phone app version.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the Tegrazone, you should check it out sometime.</p>
<p>Seriously why should I have to? This is the problem. Only tech readers even know about this tablet. Even less know that the tablet area of google play has improved, and even less care. Apple puts out high quality apps all the time for each device. You shouldn&#8217;t have to hunt and seArch for the good ones. They should be front and center, like on the amazon app store.</p>
<p>Android hasn&#8217;t had an OS worthy of developing tablet apps for. You people, yes you people, keep dogging it as if the ecosystem will remain stagnant.</p>
<p>Everything changes, even your beloved iOS and iDevices.</p>
<p>My point is amazon was smart enough to add some quality control. They made it easy like apple. Google hasn&#8217;t even tried, it seems.</p>
<p>As a dev I can tell you it is not that there aren&#8217;t any &#8220;worthy&#8221; tablets, the problem is discovery.</p>
<p>Those with tablets will never find your tablet optimized app, making it not worth the effort. If google had some kind of &#8220;tablet optimized&#8221; designator than adoption would increase, I guarantee it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s missing the point a little bit. I shouldn&#8217;t be able to download an app on a device it wasn&#8217;t made for. I know you can open iPhone apps on the iPad, but by not trying to make the apps work and rather just scaling them in a weird looking way, Apple kind of shamed devs into updating for the new size quickly. In contrast Google made sure devs supported multiple <em>phone</em> sizes from the beginning, so when tablets started arriving the the designs technically worked, nobody seemed to bother making them work better.</p>
<p>The Android Tablet app system is a bit weird.  There are apps that have technically been updated for a tablet that sucked, like Google+ before the update, but then there are apps that work perfectly even when they&#8217;re not updated, too.  The bottom line is that you can&#8217;t just search &#8220;tablet&#8221; on the Play Store and get all the good apps.</p>
<p>Supporting multiple screen sizes and densities is a real pain. Even though they&#8217;ve got it pretty standardized the emulation just isn&#8217;t good enough, and it feels like there&#8217;s a huge hidden expense there. You really can&#8217;t get a good look of how somethings going to feel without having the device in your hand. Buying all those devices with modernish components and standard screens is almost looking like a necessity. It&#8217;s just not good enough not have something you can feel as a frame of reference.</p>
<p>Our designers also hate it.</p>
<p>When we do iOS apps the designers give the programmers pixel perfect comps of how they want the UI to look, how they want it to move. Their vision gets recreated exactly.</p>
<p>Then when we do Android apps, the most common thing that happens is the iOS design is jammed into the Android system (usually due to client budget constraints). However on the rare occasion we&#8217;ve had more time to spend, the programmers are happy to create flexible layouts, but the designers lament their loss over exact placement, having to use tile-able textures, (and probably until now, lack of something as good as Core Animation on iOS).</p>
<p>Also the HiDPI thing on Android is handled atrociously — they have a lot more DPIs to support, to be fair. But the simplicity of iOS&#8217; automated @2x system is just so easy. We have scripts that we run over our asset folder to generate all the retina and non-retina content. With Android dev that&#8217;s a lot harder due to some of the whacky middle-range DPIs and requirements for everything to be resizable.</p>
<p>quite simply put building an android app is more like building a pc app rather than a dos app supporting only 320&#215;200 and 640&#215;480.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s harder for the designers, sure. but it&#8217;s a lot more future proof.</p>
<p>I understand and value that aspect of it. But so far I have not really seen it done well on Android — I haven&#8217;t seen apps equivalent to some of the most beautiful and usable on iOS. When you let designers have their way, sometimes they make really great things.</p>
<p>Also I question the usefulness of &#8220;future proofing&#8221; apps that are generally priced from $1 to $10 (or mostly free, as is the case on Android). Apple has shown time and time again that they can make their developers jump through hoops. Introduce a new resolution? Every developer is on it immediately, updating to the new system.</p>
<p>I agree with your point when it comes to PC apps. But for devices like the iPad, as a developer, I would be happy to re-write or re-build my app when a brand new Apple device is released (every few years, say). Because it leads to more sales, and forces me to keep my customers happy.</p>
<p>Coding and programming is not sacred — we don&#8217;t have to future proof it and keep it around. Throwing stuff out and starting from scratch can sometimes be the best thing you ever do for your products.</p>
<p>The real problem is that Twitter doesn&#8217;t feel that the Android tablet platform is important enough to optimize their own app. Same with Facebook and Flipboard. If they would bother, why should smaller developers?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think that Android get smartphone apps is out of the goodness of developers hearts. Supporting an app costs time and money whereas doing nothing does not.</p>
<p>I find the iPad version of Facebook to be as useful as Facebook on any Android tablet.  Sure, it may be a little prettier, but aside from that, I don&#8217;t see any benefit.</p>
<p>But&#8230;but&#8230;but&#8230;it&#8217;s not tablet specific! OMG!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tablet optimized.</p>
<p>It takes a very long time to develop an app let alone retrofit it to add functionality, and much like anything else in Android learning how to do things for tablets is time-consuming commitment. Even though I think the Nexus 7 looks promising is spending three months just learning tablet functionality a good use of time? Unless you&#8217;re designing from ground up you&#8217;re almost certainly going to be introducing new bugs you don&#8217;t know how to fix.</p>
<p>Not to mention the word &#8216;developer&#8217; is consistently misused. It&#8217;s like when people talk about OEMs without knowing what they are. On android you&#8217;ve got companies with product teams adding to their service with apps, you got solo guys who develop for search results, there&#8217;s studios producing and managing projects for clients, and there&#8217;s also solo guys who offer a service and are their own product team. That&#8217;s a lot of different scenarios you got to account for. It&#8217;s shit, although most people and companies aren&#8217;t going to add a feature unless it pays them handsomely.</p>
<p>The main problem is finding the apps. They exist, but it&#8217;s hard to see which ones are designed for tablets. And a phone UI just doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>Guess that is where we disagree.  I think the phone UI cuts it in most situations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even close to 250,000 huge.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t apps, it&#8217;s discovery of them.</p>
<p>There are 600,000 Apps available. Only a few are optimized for tablets, but all the phone-centric Apps work perfectly fine, a lot better than iPhone-Apps on an iPad, even more so on a 7&quot; tablet.</p>
<p>Except for I&#8217;ve never had to use an iPhone app for the iPad. The stuff I wanna use on a tab;let always has a native version. Which thank god that&#8217;s not an issue since the iPad is now at 2048 &#215; 1536. But I disagree that they look fine on the tablet. Do they work? sure&#8230;. but they are far inferior than a native tablet app most of the time.</p>
<p>Eh I just got an iPad and I was shocked to run into apps that are only available to the iPhone. The experience is similar on both platforms, except Apple makes a huge deal out of it and screams THIS IS NOT A TABLET APP and for me that makes my experience much worse than just scaling like Android. It feels as if I&#8217;m not even supposed to use the app at all on iOS.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s to encourage developers to update their apps. It&#8217;s what Google should be doing, too.</p>
<p>Except the way you build apps for iOS and Android is drastically different. On both accounts devs are either being lazy or don&#8217;t have the time/funding. One companies approach is to make my end experience not so hot, the others is to make it tolerable. Usually Apple is out for the consumer, but I feel in this scenario it&#8217;s reverse.</p>
<p>Such as? I have over one hundred apps on my iPad. Only one is not a universal or iPad only, and it is a specific todo list app.</p>
<p>I mean cool story for you and your apps, but my experience is different. There are certainly more tablet specific apps in iOS, but some big ones like Tumblr seem to come to mind. I don&#8217;t download them all, just stumble across them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing you didn&#8217;t use Spotify till about 3 months ago?<br />
Facebook only released their iPad app last year&#8230;</p>
<p>sure if you count skinds, widgets, lock screens, launchers as apps. I don&#8217;t see any quality, amazing apps on Android. Most are just ported from iOS and look rediculous in Android UI.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t want fine apps, they want the best apps. Thats why android will never be as good as iOS. They really don&#8217;t care to be the best.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve preordered one because it looks cool to play around with, but I&#8217;d agree with you. 8.8 seems way too high. Clearly it&#8217;s not time to stop giving Google a pass.</p>
<p>Apparently an &#8220;incredible lack of developer support.&#8221; still nets you a 7/10 for ecosystem.</p>
<p>Windows phone, which has an ecosystem where MSFT is being forced to write apps for big companies in house because those companies have no interest in developing for windows phone, also got a 7. And then people complained it was too low.</p>
<p>Are you telling me that you honestly feel that the ecosystem for a 7&quot; android tablet is worse? Bearing in mind if you watched the video you should notice that phone apps work remarkably well due to the smaller gap between 7 inches and 5 inches.</p>
<blockquote>Are you telling me that you honestly feel that the ecosystem for a 7&quot; android tablet is worse? </blockquote>
<p>What? Not at all. Josh was 100% correct in his assessment of the WP7 situation and obviously Android tablets aren&#8217;t <strong>as</strong> bad.</p>
<p>But when a paragraph is dedicated to app support or the lack thereof and features the words &#8220;suffers from an incredible lack of developer support&#8221;, &#8220;mainstream apps &#8230; have yet to be updated to an appropriate tablet-friendly design&#8221;, &#8220;not working 100% correctly&#8221;, &#8220;aren&#8217;t optimized for the tablet in any way&#8221;, &#8220;.hopefully that&#8217;ll be changing soon&#8221;, and &#8220;A problem Gogole needs to tackle&#8221;, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be expecting a 7/10 for ecosystem and 8.8 overall.</p>
<p>ICS and Jelly Bean are very, very good OSes, but it&#8217;s been 18 months since Android hit tablets, and mainstream apps like Twitter still don&#8217;t have an acceptable tablet layout.</p>
<p>Is the app situation as dire as WP7? Or the Blackberry/Playbook? Or WebOS? Of course not. Can you run phone apps just fine? Absolutely. But Josh is still giving Google a pass when it comes to the app ecosystem &#8212; something that will be very important particularly in non-US countries where Google Play doesn&#8217;t offer the the same breadth of content as it does in the US.</p>
<p>Windows phone got a 7 for ecosystem, this got a 7 for ecosystem. If you think this score should be lower what you are saying is you feel that the android ecosystem is comparatively weaker than windows phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we can critique the overall score until we actually use the product, saying the review is wrong when you haven&#8217;t even seen the tablet for yourself is stupid. When deciding if you can trust a reviewer, be IRA movie reviewer or a tech reviewer find some products you are familiar with and read their reviews on those products that you know well and see if you agree. If you agree then you can trust the reviews on the products that you haven&#8217;t used by that same person. I have done that for Josh so I personally trust his scores.</p>
<p>The ecosystem and software are the only things we can talk about. The tablet app selection is poor but the phone selection is decent and phone apps work very well on his particular form factor. I think a 7 is reasonable, especially when you compare it windows phone which you have to do with reviews. It does not deserve worse than windows phone in my opinion.</p>
<p>Windows phone got a 4 for ecosystem, and there are hardly any GOOD android tablet apps available. I think its fair to say that ecosystem should be lower, you are reviewing a tablet after all, not a phone. (I still pre-ordered this to play around with though)</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t the point that Apple essentially force you to target iPhone and iPad seperately but combine it into a Universal Binary, whereas Google have an API add-on called Fragments that tries to do the work in a fuzzy way?</p>
<p>If the API is used, you don&#8217;t need to target an Android tablet, it just works.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how it works to be honest (yet), but i&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s like screensize &amp; platform targeting in CSS.</p>
<p>You do sort of need to target tablets (whether to start a new screen or place it on the same screen), but its not too difficult to get a basic master/detail set up</p>
<p>Because just about every phone app scales up and typically gives you more information on the screen then it would on a smaller screen.  So, right off the bat, you are benefiting from the larger screen.  So while Apple does have a lot of tablet apps, many of them are probably just manually scaled up versions of their phone apps.</p>
<p>For example, the new Podcast app from Apple.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/7sme4ul" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/7sme4ul</a> .  The tablet optimized version is just a manually scaled up phone version.</p>
<p>Yeah but then take a look at something like iPhoto, Keynote (or any of the iWork apps). The UI is <em>completely</em> overhauled for the phone size. And it needs to be —</p>
<p>A Podcast app doesn&#8217;t need much special treatment, because you consume with it. It just needs to show pretty pictures and let you choose a cast.</p>
<p>But their productivity apps have an amazing amount of thought put into both the phone and tablet versions. They are <em>entirely different</em> in their designs, yet still meet the same goals.</p>
<p>when you say other eco system, you mean ios? Cause there is no other eco systems for tablets&#8230; WP/RIM etc are all dead in this space!</p>
<p>WP = Windows Phone? That&#8217;s for phones.</p>
<p>Windows RT is for tablets. Kinda hard to ignore.</p>
<p>HP is going to ignore it &#8230;</p>
<p>Good for them. Their hardware was cheap shit even at high-end, and even then most of them looked like Apple ripoffs.</p>
<p>Also, have you seen the Touchpad?</p>
<p>(PalmOS is no issue, the hardware is.)</p>
<p>WTF is RT? Is this another Windowz XP crap?</p>
<p>I think I just shat my pants.</p>
<p>Well, at least it won&#8217;t get 400,000 viruses.<br />
Poor Compy.</p>
<p>This is how I felt when Sergey Brin took the stage. <br />
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ifkZVqobqag/T-3HqebQRrI/AAAAAAAAMC4/EJsw-S80vck/s700/12.jpg" /></p>
<p>i stole this&#8230;just letting you know this&#8230;haha</p>
<p>haha, the one on the right is far more cheesier than on the left. At least the one on the left had a working piece on technology, not some plastic gimmick, even though it was a movie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong Bad, did you get a virus?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes&#8230; very yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a Tablet with no apps. Nice!</p>
<p>:S</p>
<p>no apps? really?   nice try&#8230;.</p>
<p>Lets not forgot that this is a pure Google Tablet that will get upgrades and love directly from Google. The main reason i want it…It is a NEXUS! That’s it, pure and simple. Love the price, love android, and of course the Google ecosystem. I’m ordering 2 of them.</p>
<p>I feel like the scoring system means little since the average is 7.75, not 8.8&#8230;why even bother?</p>
<p>This tablet is going to kick Kindle Fire out of the market. Anyways help me out in making my blog better, donate on this link please <a href="http://igg.me/p/134639?a=751826" target="_blank">http://igg.me/p/134639?a=751826</a></p>
<p>I want one.</p>
<p>At this price, I think I can justify getting one for myself AND a few family members.</p>
<p>play.google.com</p>
<p>it is not that easy if you live in Europe&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;.it is with American friends :D</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for this&#8230;. can&#8217;t afford an iPad but this gives me all the power of the iPad, more portable form factor and still a HD screen for 2/5ths of the price!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still lacking in the app department, so a full iPad replacement it is not.</p>
<p>Considering the only apps I use are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and a few games which are already on my Samsung Galaxy Tab anyway, I&#8217;m sure I could get Shadowgun and more on this tablet. I already have an iPhone so I can still use both app ecosystems. Doesn&#8217;t need to be a full iPad replacement anyway, it is $300 cheaper!</p>
<p>Agree. However, what I feel is so awesome about the iPad is that I can leave my laptop at home a lot of the time. I&#8217;m yet to see a 7&quot; tablet that changes my mind about them, but for the price&#8230;.I&#8217;m seriously considering this one. The review and the price help it a lot.</p>
<p>With this device and a VNC app, do you think you could leave your laptop at home?</p>
<p>You might find that 7 inches is better after you get used to it. Using 7 inch talents before I hated it at first but then felt the size was a sweet spot because you can fit it in a big pocket, it fits in one hand etc. it&#8217;s perfect for reading books and watching movies.</p>
<p>I envy you though, the iPad has never been ale to be a laptop replacement for me. The better web browsing experience often isn&#8217;t enough to convince me to take it with me very often. My phone does the trick, i bring it with me if I am going on a trip but it&#8217;s not a daily thing for me. That&#8217;s why I am excited by the Surface, I feel that could honestly be a laptop replacement, meaning you can be productive on it.</p>
<p>you summarized my thinking perfectly</p>
<p>Exactly. Right now it feels like the sweet spot is to own a laptop and a 7&quot; tablet. 10 inches right now feels like a s trange compromise between the two. 10&quot; tablets need to come closer to being laptop replacements if they want to stay relevant.</p>
<p>Hehe.</p>
<p>For me, right now it feels like the sweet spot is to own a small smartphone and a 10&quot; tablet.  7&quot; right now feels like a strange compromise between the two&#8230; ;)</p>
<p>I suppose thats why they all exist!</p>
<p>Well I would agree with you if the 10&quot; device was a surface because then it matters but for me the extra 3 inches on the ipad is a lot of inconvience for not a lot of gain. Books and magazines and movies look better on the 7 inch form factor in my opinion and thats what these devices are all about. If we are talking typing a document etc then yeah I can definitely see 10 inches being important but the iPad can&#8217;t do that (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says, I am a student, I seriously tried, it doesn&#8217;t work.)</p>
<p>You think magazines look better on a 7 inch than a 10 inch?  I&#8217;m not sure I understand why, but as CTRLALT said, that&#8217;s why they all exist.</p>
<p>For me, right now it feels like the sweet spot is to own a big smartphone and a laptop.</p>
<p>I really doubt a 7&quot; screen will be that much useful  than a 4.7&quot; screen. Especially since I can do pretty much everything that I would do on a 10&quot; tablet already on my GNex.</p>
<p>I find I prefer actual web browsing on my iPad but I prefer certain websites on my other devices (primarily Youtube on OS X/ Linux &gt; iPad) but for watching my subscriptions it&#8217;s pretty good. I wish they&#8217;d overhaul the Youtube app on iOS to make it sooo much better, I think I could use the iPad more.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t need to envy, I said, most of the time. The Surface&#8230;well&#8230;that&#8217;s a whole other subject. Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;ll wait about a year before getting a Metro product. I have no idea about their ARM vs. Intel, Metro Apps, etc. There&#8217;re so many unanswered questions, that only time will tell. Just one man&#8217;s opinion though.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s all you use then there are probably better things you could spend $200 on.</p>
<p>No offense, but $200 is pretty  much impulse buy category.</p>
<p>Like 1/2 of an iPad 2? or 2/5 of an iPad 3rd generation?</p>
<p>Not only do you have most games, i love android tablets because you don&#8217;t have to buy the same app twice. <br />
A lot of people don&#8217;t think of this when they say &#8220;no tablet apps!!!!&#8221;. This is actually better. You&#8217;re not paying twice for a tablet and a smartphone app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve purchased lots of high end games for my smartphone like GTA and they work great on the tablet. No need to pay for a tablet version.</p>
<p>For a significant (and growing) number of iOS apps, this is not an issue either.  Many apps are universal, and include both a phone-optimized AND a tablet-optimized version for one price.</p>
<p>further fragmentation of Android OS.</p>
<p>what app  is it lacking that you want?</p>
<p>Nexus 7 is far better than iPad in every way except for the lack of Game Center and the resolution isn&#8217;t as good.</p>
<p>Ok, the fanboi in you is showing. We all know this isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m curious &#8211; what&#8217;s Google Play like outside of the US? In Australia it&#8217;s pretty bare &#8211; no TV shows, no Music, Movie rentals only.</p>
<p>here in the Netherlands, we only have apps&#8230;</p>
<p>Here in Brazil, we only have access to Apps too.</p>
<p>I guess you need to come to America! We have compulsory health insurance! &quot;&quot;Give me your tired, your poor,<br />
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free and watch Tv on a Nexus tablet&quot;<br />
(apologies to Emma Lazarus)</p>
<p>Most western countries have a state medical system so your taxes are higher but you are gaurunteed coverage or compulsory health insurance and have had for a long long time because their governments actually look out for their citizens and their electorates are smart enough not to critise the government for something that is clearly better for them.</p>
<p>Now talk tech, this is a tech blog.</p>
<p>Singapore, Hong Kong and Switzerland have such low taxes most americans can&#8217;t even imagine it, yet, they all have universal coverage (and in switzerland you don&#8217;t have a state owned health system). Not only that, but Singapore spends 1/4 per capita of what the US spends in health.</p>
<p>Just making a joke, mon frere. Easy does it on the lecturing!</p>
<p>Apps only in Sweden too. I think the only countries that have <em>anything</em> beyond apps are the English-speaking ones, with US being the only one having everything.</p>
<p>Outside America, most of the countries only have apps.</p>
<p>In France we have already the movies and books should come soon, too</p>
<p>in italy we have apps and books, but rumor is that movies are coming pretty soon..</p>
<p>I think outside US they&#8217;re still working out licensing deals.</p>
<p>We get Books and Movies in the UK, although Goolge really seems to be pushing Google Play with dedicated devices such as the Q. I think one reason the Q is US only for the time being is that most of the world has limited Play content. I would guess, and hope, that Google will be planning on expanding Play across other countries in the not too distant future and get Android in homes across the world.</p>
<p>Overpriced books and movies :(</p>
<p>Movies and Books are no different in price to iTunes. Granted Kindle is cheaper but Amazon subsidises quite a few of the books. Play Books just needs more content here!</p>
<p>Really? I find that books in the Play store are usually less expensive than their Kindle counterparts.</p>
<p> Not really googles call, it&#8217;s the publishing houses etc. I am sure google is doing their upmost to try and get it expanded but the houses are resistant. Even apples selection isn&#8217;t complete outside the US, it&#8217;s annoying</p>
<p>Also maybe the movie studios and publishers aren&#8217;t big monoliths like here in the States and you have to cut deals with each individual company.</p>
<p>In the UK, we have movies, apps, and books. I&#8217;m using Google Music as I type this, but that&#8217;s only because I used a proxy to get an invite when it was still in beta. I can&#8217;t buy anything from Google Play yet, music wise.</p>
<p>Hoping we get magazine stuff soon. Pumped about that; hope Engadget put their <em>Distro </em>on there. Only thing I like about Engadget.</p>
<p>Or you could just, you know, download the Distro app.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a magazine. Why not put it in the magazines section of Google Play?</p>
<p>From the demo magazines looked identical to paper magazines. Distro is different, it&#8217;s an interactive magazine style app which admittedly is what magazines on a tablet should be but judging by the examples the shown that&#8217;s not what magazines are to them. To them magazines were static pictures that you could zoom in and out of.</p>
<p>Here in the pihlippines, only Apps are currently available.<br />
I went to the nexus 7 page yesterday only to be met with a Not yet available in your country page.</p>
<p>I really hope Google delivers this internationally as it is an automatic sell for people in the know, and at the current price range, it will shit bricks, literally.</p>
<p>Considering the track record of Nexus devices, I don&#8217;t see why Nexus 7 won&#8217;t be available  in a broader range of countries. Only issue, however, is the availability of content. :/</p>
<p>Just move in to the states. :)</p>
<p>How is that helpful? Seriously why do you feel the need to waste your time with such a pointless reply? I live in Australia, should I sell my hundreds of thousands of non-existent assets  and move to &#8220;the greatest country on earth&#8221; (it&#8217;s not) just for better choice of content from one of several services. Grow up.</p>
<p>I know video games are much more expensive in Australia, how about apps? do you know if you get charged more for them also? <br />
PS. Us Americans can be silly please don&#8217;t hold it against us.</p>
<p>So, what you are saying is that not only do you not get TV Shows and Music from Google Play, but you a;so don&#8217;t get jokes.</p>
<p>Oh so sorry, I didn&#8217;t realise that you knew RangersK personally and you can speak with such authority when confidently justifying his unhelpful suggestion as a joke.</p>
<p>When someone complains about the state of such services in their country, you don&#8217;t just mock them with implausible solutions and let other people justify said comment as a joke.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure he was kidding&#8230; I don&#8217;t think you were looking for that kind of level of advice from this comment section right?</p>
<p>in Germany we get Apps &amp; Books<br />
and my Xoom got 4.04 today &#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s not like there are any hardware differences between The US Wifi version an the EMEA version &#8230;<br />
sorry for the rant</p>
<p>I really hope this makes a big dent in the tablet market. In my opinion, this is the only Android tablet that is worth my money (and it is so cheap!). I really want this to push Apple with competition.</p>
<p>The new Asus Transformer Infinity is also a option that seems to be very interesting &#8211; more expensive, but also bigger and with a lot of interesting features (like the usual keyboard dock)</p>
<p>I love both of those tablets, but I&#8217;m going to hold on to my AOKP Touchpad another month or two to see if Samsung announces an Exynos 5 powered Galaxy Tab.</p>
<p>I think this is a huge win for Google. More powerful than the iPad, but still smaller and way cheaper!</p>
<p>Smaller is an objective fact. Cheaper is an objective fact.</p>
<p>More powerful. Hmmm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s close enough really. When you account for the massive resolution of the iPad, this easily keeps up with it (and outperforms it in some ways).</p>
<p>It is barely more powerful in processing power (which iOS needs very little of), but Anand tested the new iPad and its graphics were about 3.7 times better than Nvidia&#8217;s Tegra 3. In real world benchmarks including the display, the iPad performed graphically about twice as well. So it is not really close.</p>
<p>You are missing the point.  The new iPad also has 2-3 times more pixels to push.</p>
<p>Maybe you should read his comment again.</p>
<p>Oh, it wasn&#8217;t clear.  He said Anand tested the Tegra 3, not that he tested the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>The 3rd gen iPad is horribly under powered for creative apps.  Try using sketchbook ink, art rage etc. they are barely usable.</p>
<p>See, this is a better discussion.  What does &#8220;more powerful&#8221; even mean without respect to particular functions?</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s less usable for that type of content creation &#8211; a struggling processor or a smaller screen? I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a clear cut answer to that question.</p>
<p>Can I also point out that one of the reasons those art apps are so frustrating is the lag in the capacitive screen. As far as we know, that hasn&#8217;t improved here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue the inaccuracies of the screen, coupled with the severe lag in rendering makes it entirely useless for the effort. Meanwhile a smaller screen with less lag, or even lower res may be useful. I can&#8217;t say if the Nexus 7 is &#8220;more&#8221; powerful until I try it. But I was surprised at how poor the performance of the &#8220;best in class&#8221; tablet was.  If you charge a premium make certain you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Entirely useless? I&#8217;m not sure the extremist language is fair. Isn&#8217;t it enough to say that you find it useless?</p>
<p>I repeat: I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a clear cut answer to this question. Different people are going to value different things from their experience, which will mean that some will <em>prefer</em> the iPad and some people will <em>prefer</em> the Nexus 7. Is it possible for you to concur with that?</p>
<p>it definitely is not &#8220;more powerful&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really good device (maybe even &#8216;iPad class&#8217;&#8230; that&#8217;s up for debate), but comments like that make my head hurt.</p>
<p>The review does lead the reader to believe it&#8217;s just as powerful. I don&#8217;t agree, but that&#8217;s the spin of the review.</p>
<p>Perhaps more powerful than the iPad 2 you could argue.  Not the new one&#8217;s GPU however.</p>
<p>A consideration is that it should need about 1/2 the GPU power for the same performance, just because it&#8217;s driving so many fewer pixels. The comparison is kind of moot though &#8211; so long as performance is roughly in parity, no consumer cares about power.</p>
<p>it&#8217;ll be great for people who don&#8217;t need much out of their tablet, and hopefully this helps drive the surfaces arm version price down, but I&#8217;s still chose the iPad for the screen alone. My iPad continues to bum me out that 16000 monitors are still like a grand.</p>
<p>Great review. Looks like Google have finally nailed it. Solid performance, portability, features and most importantly, <strong>price</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking forward to this.</p>
<p>Yeah I wish had this instead of my Fire.</p>
<p>To Ebay!</p>
<p>*eBay</p>
<p>Amazon Video on Google Play and I&#8217;m buying one.</p>
<p>someone pulled the APK from the fire but supposedly on works at the Fire&#8217;s resolution. Also no streaming over 3G</p>
<p>Google Play is crappy in Australia, but if Google eventually improves that, this could be interesting. I only want a tablet for magazines (WIRED, and some AU ones), occasional movies and music and web browsing, like The Verge. This tablet sounds great for US people, but the iPad still kills it and, as a content consumption device, that&#8217;s fatal.</p>
<p>Definitely agreed here. I jumped on the AU Play Store went &#8220;Really? That&#8217;s it?&#8221; with such limited storage it&#8217;s a bit of a tough sell if that&#8217;s all we have access to.</p>
<p>Surely Google can open the Magazine store here and allow submissions. Even if it&#8217;s slim pickings, at least give us something rather than no magazines at all.</p>
<p>You have access to anything you want to put on the tablet. That USB port is there for a reason.</p>
<p>8/16GB is nowhere near enough. And sticking an external HDD in (Assuming it supports that?) kind of defeats the purpose.</p>
<p>External HDD, yes. SD/MicroSD, feasible with a USB OTG cable and a card reader.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not ideal, but given how the latency of dealing with external storage has historically been a failing of performance with Android, you can see why they&#8217;ve done it.</p>
<p>Streaming would still be nicer and, as usual, Google has been taking it&#8217;s time going global. Not even the UK has Music.</p>
<blockquote>Google has been taking it’s time going global. </blockquote> <p>That&#8217;s because there are &#8220;1 million&#8221; separate copyright holders. This is more a problem with international copyright law than Google&#8217;s unwillingness to roll it out.</p>
<p>They have to make sure it&#8217;s profitable before incurring the cost of expanding it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also located in Australia and while it would be nice to have a better offering with Play, the fact that you can just dump any old media file on the Android tab and it will play is a big deal to me.</p>
<p>This might not make getting new content as easy as the iPad, but if you already have a whole lot of content in differing formats this has got the iPad beat.</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s just my opinion.</p>
<p>Stop ur whinging, try NZ&#8230; oh wait, no google play, therefore, no damn Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Android is looking very tasty now and this is coming from an Apple fanboy</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t go that far &#8211; this device is certainly looking very tasty, especially compared to the absolute RUBBISH most Android OEMs are pumping out.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing what this year&#8217;s Nexus is like!</p>
<p>Agree. Feels like the hardware and software were meant for each other.</p>
<p>At this price, why choose? Get both!</p>
<p>Now if only the stupid developers would make apps for it!</p>
<p>Calling them stupid helps your argument. Especially when the smart money is developing for the iPad.</p>
<p>Which app are you actually missing?</p>
<p>When did you last check? A year ago perhaps?</p>
<p>Looks like I&#8217;m finally getting a tablet! Great review as always.</p>
<p>Ok, this DOES make up for the lack of a Vergecast tonight. This was a great review! I wonder though, will Emoji work cross-platform now? I would like to send my android friends police car icons and the like. That would be nice.</p>
<p>Thanks for the late-night review Josh!</p>
<p>Well, if your friends have a messaging app like Go SMS, you already can. But to answer your question, yes.</p>
<p>This has the potential to become ubiquitous at this price tag, watch out Kindle, watch out ipad&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, but only if they advertise it.</p>
<p> I think this will sell like hotcakes if they can make it in enough numbers, every cat, dog and biped is gonna have one&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sad that they&#8217;re not making a model for spiders.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t someone think of the arachnids?</p>
<p>Thats what third parties are for&#8230;.</p>
<p>Wonder when will it get launched in Asian markets.</p>
<p>Google Now is great right now, but I think it would be so much more useful on a device with a data connection, like a smartphone. With a persistent connection, Now will know where you are on a commute to help you navigate and will better be able to know where you are. When I have this on my smartphone, I think it will be great!</p>
<p>Exactly what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Im using Google Now on my Nexus right now. And it works amazingly well. The way it predicts some of your patterns is freaky..</p>
<p>Great. Now the government is going to sue google for knowing too much.</p>
<p>$199 is not equal to £159.  I want one (even though I have an ipad3), but why do people in the UK always have to pay a premium?</p>
<p>The first price I came across for this tablet in Finland was 449€.. <strong>sigh</strong></p>
<p>Because the UK imposes extra tariffs on technology items. Blame your politicians.</p>
<p>Because of VAT, amongst other things. At 20%, and assuming googles conversion to £, that puts it in for us at about £153, and thats not including other taxes payed by Google which would push up that extra £6</p>
<p>It is not really too much of a premium and not one I am complaining about. Although my Bank account is now&#8230;where did that £199 go?</p>
<p>This is a really, a truly excellent bit of kit. Can you imagine what it is going to be like when Tesco start churning these out? Based on Tesco&#8217;s recent grab as a content provider, they have the potential to get behind something like this and all they need is a confirmation that the Tesco Digital store is pre-installed. Or even offer a small credit for it. I can picture millions of these being marched out of superstores across the UK up to Christmas.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t get Tesco Digital pre-installed, its a Nexus. But yeah, giving away a voucher would be a very good idea.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure they are equivalent when you consider all of the tax you pay (and the fact that tax isn&#8217;t included in the $199)</p>
<p>£159 for this is still a good deal &#8211; even more so considering how many companies would have just swapped the $ for a £.<br />
Google just did the tablet competitor how it needs to be done &#8211; regardless of how good the product is (personally, I think this is being sold as being something less than it really is), there needs to be a concession to the fact that there are plenty of people that refer to any tablet as an &#8216;iPad&#8217;, just as vacuum cleaners get called &#8216;Hoovers&#8217;.</p>
<p>Ebuyer are doing the 16GB model for £199 inc. VAT &amp; delivered.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s cheaper than Google will sell it once tax &amp; shipping are applied, as it works out as ~£193 once taxed &amp; converted before shipping.</p>
<p>But Ebuyer probably will not offer the £15 Play credit will they? So that means buying direct is still the best value for the moment. Even QuidCo won&#8217;t offer a better deal&#8230;</p>
<p>That $199 is before tax. Remember it&#8217;s after the sale for some reason in the US.</p>
<p>Yup&#8230; because sales tax rates vary from state to state.  Within each state, sales tax varies from city to city.  If you are not in the city (rural), then your sales tax is usually even less.</p>
<p>So no site displays prices with tax in the US (but it is not uncommon to show the sales tax AFTER you put in your shipping information).</p>
<p>Some online retailers, Amazon comes to mind, will try to find loopholes in sales tax laws to not charge you tax at all (except in states where there is an Amazon wharehouse).</p>
<p>*warehouse</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&#8217;s the reason. What a shame you don&#8217;t have the same tax rate across the country.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happens when you have things like regional differences in a large country. Some people don&#8217;t want many local services and some people do, and the taxing flexibility allows the country to have a variety (also creates huge problems in some areas close to boundaries).</p>
<p>So have Google done away with the whole tablet UI found on all the other Android tablets?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still there for 10&quot; devices &#8211; seems 7&quot; devices use this now.</p>
<p>Yep, still on 10&quot; devices.</p>
<p>Or is it going away in Jellybean? (not sure)</p>
<p>Nope, it&#8217;ll still be there. Maybe modified, but still there.</p>

<p>Thanks Josh for convincing me to order it!</p>
<p>It looks like a genuinely good piece of hardware.  It&#8217;s too  bad Android&#8217;s tablet ecosystem is so woefully lacking.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will turn enough heads to change that.</p>
<p>This is literally the perfect tablet.  Its size is correct and it&#8217;s price is definitely correct.  Once more and more apps are optimized for this tablet, we&#8217;re going to be looking at one amazing device for an insanely low price.  Google had to start somewhere and this thing looks amazing.  I&#8217;d buy one right now if I could and I never felt like I wanted an Ipad because I didn&#8217;t feel like it was worth its price.  This looks worth its price easily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only missing app support. Kind of a big deal, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, because the app support will remain stagnant right? The iPad app support had to start somewhere&#8230;</p>
<p>I want one&#8230;</p>
<p>How is Flipboard on tablets like this?</p>
<p>It might be okay on a 7in tablet, but they don&#8217;t have a very good 10in experience (it&#8217;s just a blown up phone app)</p>
<p>Hardware looks good but Play really sucks and there are still not enough tablet optimized apps.</p>
<p>Play&#8217;s good in general, it&#8217;s just tablet apps are sparse right now.</p>
<p>plenty of apps for this size of device. because of the kindle fire and tab 7, ziio&#8217;s etc.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not many. Apps that use Fragments (like the app I&#8217;m helping make, Boid) look OK on tablets because they use Fragments.</p>
<p>Except we can&#8217;t get Boid on Tablets :(</p>
<p>Extract the apk (there&#8217;s loads of Chrome extensions to extract a free apk directly from the web Play Store) and use it :)</p>
<p>A tablet UI for Boid is coming very soon!</p>
<p>Was totally sold that my first tablet was going to be an iPad 3 until this was announced. Very excited!</p>
<p>When visiting The New York Times&#8230; <br />
<blockquote>Oh, that&#8217;s cute. A Nexus 7 ad. </blockquote><br />
Great review, Josh. This will most likely be my first tablet. Google has certainly stepped up to the plate.</p>
<p>yea its gonna be my first tablet too :)</p>
<p>How would media that I own get sync&#8217;d to the tablet?  Couldn&#8217;t see any mention of that in the review ( unless I&#8217;ve missed it&#8230;. ).</p>
<p>Mostly over the air. All the media apps have an option to &#8220;Pin&#8221; content which downloads them and makes them available offline. Otherwise the device will stream from the cloud. Only real exception to this is Music (if not uploaded to Google Music, so for users outside of America) &amp; Photos (although a lot can be done from the device w/ Picasa &amp; Google Plus) which are done using MTP which is a standard camera/MP3 Player USB protocol</p>
<p>Ah, that&#8217;s cool, thank you!</p>
<p>16GB isn&#8217;t much, but it&#8217;s more than enough a few movies ( and the UK store doesn&#8217;t seem to have a vast range&#8230;. ).</p>
<p>It definitely turned out to be worth waiting for. Going to get myself one for sure. Great job guys.</p>
<p>It definitely looks like a best Android tablet device to date, but is it better than iPad? Nope, Apple still has App Store/iTunes Store etc&#8230; And, do not forget that it&#8217;s 10-inch which is much better for home casual usage and it is not that big carry around&#8230; And better battery life&#8230;</p>
<p>So, if you are looking for cheap, but good device &#8594; Nexus 7. If you are looking just for the best device &#8594; iPad, even the old one.</p>
<blockquote>So, if you are looking for <strong>inexpensive as well as</strong> good device → Nexus 7</blockquote>
<p>FTFY</p>
<p>Looks good but Google removing any chance of HDMI connectivity is really cost cutting gone mad.</p>
<p>Agreed. Not even a dongle? :-/</p>
<p>Maybe we&#8217;ll see a Nexus 7+ in the future?</p>
<p>The microUSB may be HDMI. Dunno, probably not, but you never know.</p>
<p>I meant MHL. Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>slams head against desk</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping they make a Pogo dock for this that has full size USB and HDMI. MHL is fine if you&#8217;re just going to hook it up to a TV, but I want to connect a USB wireless mouse and keyboard at the same time, and as far as I know MHL can&#8217;t do HDMI and USB host at the same time.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not MHL, Engadget confirmed it on their review. They said there&#8217;s no way of getting HDMI.</p>
<p>Unless you buy a Q. . .</p>
<p>but even that doesn&#8217;t screen cast&#8230; sigh.</p>
<p>Yep.. I&#8217;m really confused by this, especially because the original Asus tablet this was based on had mini HDMI, so it should be a matter of a $0.05 connector.</p>
<p>Yep.. I&#8217;m really confused by this, especially because the original Asus tablet this was based on had mini HDMI, so it should be a matter of a $0.05 connector.We&#8217;ll probably even see the solder pads in the circuit board once someone does a teardown.</p>

<p>Oops not sure what happened there..</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s undoubtedly the best 7&quot; tablet and quite possibly the best Android tablet, I did find it that hilarious that Josh shifted up the score by a full point. The scores average out to 7.75, and that&#8217;s with a very generous ecosystem rating.</p>
<p>i doubt &#8220;camera&#8221; for a tablet is weighted as heavily as &#8220;softwre&#8221;</p>
<p>Bottom line is Josh has clearly exercised his power in the final score. While this is a very compelling device, I worry that the adjustment may not stay true in the long run. 8.8 is a seriously high score for any product, and a score not reached by any flagship Android device this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;More times than not, the Verge score is based on the average of the subscores below. However, since this is a non-weighted average, we reserve the right to tweak the overall score if we feel it doesn&#8217;t reflect our overall assessment and price of the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you said, Josh obviously decided that the average was not an accurate reflection of his experiences, and the fact that the product is only 199 dollars also goes into it. On the podcasts they have been talking about how future promise also is put into account (the Lytro), and how products can be improved due to their price. What I got out of this was Josh in effect saying at this price point and with the inevitable push from Android into the tablet space, the Nexus 7 is the best option for someone looking to get into the Android space and wants prompt updates.</p>
<p>This is not a minor tweak, it&#8217;s throwing a respectable device into a highly-exclusive club of products with ~9.0 scores. As I&#8217;ve iterated elsewhere, price has commonly been ignored during reviews, receiving a footnote &#8211; many devices are in fact played down because they don&#8217;t measure up to &#8220;competitors&#8221; that are priced hundreds of dollars above the device. If someone told me a product scores a 9/10, I wouldn&#8217;t think that there are still serious questions to be asked regarding the platform and ecosystem (similarly, I didn&#8217;t expect an 8.0+ score for any Windows Phone Mango device for the same reason).</p>
<p>You got around 6000 developers who now own a nexus 7 tablet, so we are bound to see more tablet optimized apps</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really too early to say &#8211; it didn&#8217;t happen with the Galaxy 10.1.</p>
<p>The Galaxy 10.1 started with Gingerbread which is a terrible OS for a tablet, as was Honeycomb. With ICS rolling out (hopefully in a timely fashion) to more and more devices especially tablets, don&#8217;t bet on the tablet ecosystem remaining stagnant as it has.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re getting confused.  The Galaxy Tab 10.1 is the one that Google gave away a year ago to I/O attendees.  It came with Honeycomb.  The guy you&#8217;re replying to is pointing out that a large number of developers received them for free, so it clearly takes more than just giving away free tablets to developers in order to get them on board.</p>
<p>There WAS an earlier version of the tab which only had Gingerbread.  IIRC it was the only one released by a major manufacturer that used the &#8220;phone&#8221; version of the OS.</p>
<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, I think the problem with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 may have simply been that even a blind man could see that Honeycomb was rushed out as quickly as possible with little regard to whether it worked well.  What developer would want to put their support behind that?  Even ICS had a fair number of obvious oversights that JB needed to correct.  It also wasn&#8217;t a proper &#8220;Nexus&#8221; device and there was a clear sense at the time that Google was promoting it only because it was the best they could offer, not because they were satisfied with it.</p>
<p>Also &#8211; and now I&#8217;m just getting into personal opinion &#8211; I&#8217;ve never liked the 10&quot; form factor.  I&#8217;ve tried about half a dozen of them, including the iPad 2 which is the lightest one AFAIK.  But even so, they&#8217;re all too big, heavy, and awkward.  You can&#8217;t really hold it with one hand but to interact with it you need to.  The keyboard&#8217;s obnoxiously huge &#8211; thought that&#8217;s something easily rectified with Swiftkey 3&#8217;s tablet version.  It&#8217;s too big to really be portable.  In short, I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an ideal size for anything intended to be a portable device.  5 to 8 inches is more reasonable, and 7 makes a great compromise.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m disappointed the Nexus 7 doesn&#8217;t have expandable storage or HDMI output, I gave it some thought and I think the reason these are missing has nothing to do with cost cutting.  If Google included them, they would be cutting the legs out from beneath all of their OEM partners.  A tablet with every conceivable high-end feature, the lightest 7-incher so far, and being sold almost for a loss?  That would piss some people off.  How could anyone possibly compete with that?  I doubt even Samsung could beat that without taking a loss.</p>
<p>gotta minus all the ones on ebay and the ones taken home by techblogs</p>
<p>Average of scores is 7.75, but overall score is 8.8? huh? Or am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>Clearly, some are not as important as others.</p>
<p>This is a bogus assertion; looking at the breakdown of subcategories, to have the product anywhere near 8.8 would require the sparse two 9/10s to be weighted very, very heavily. The answer is that Josh adjusted the score, as he is entitled to.</p>
<p>The camera got a 6? Really?</p>
<p>And i say this because:<br />

<p>Those aren&#8217;t the same category of device&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>If you’re one of those people who likes to snap pics with their tablet — first, shame on you.</blockquote>
<p>Way to go, Josh.</p>
<p>Fantastic review, as always, although as a review for an ebook reading device, I found the lack of 50 Shades of Grey reference is a little disappointing,</p>
<p>Take my money Google!  I put jelly bean on my nexus.  It&#8217;s nice. Can&#8217;t wait to use the tablet.</p>
<p>Dear google.  Let me buy, please.</p>
<p>I just got my credit card out to buy this thing, and was met with a &#8220;seller does not accept payments from your location&#8221; message. W.T.F., google? For someone who wants a piece of the tablet market, you sure are making it difficult for me to support you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m in Zimbabwe. I&#8217;m in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. And my card is a Bank of America card.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kind of humorous that you can&#8217;t buy a product intended for the US with a &#8220;Bank of America&#8221; card. (granted, you aren&#8217;t here, but still&#8230; I think you can see what I am getting at)</p>
<p>Yeah. At first I figured it was a problem with my local bank&#8217;s card. (Newegg won&#8217;t accept my international Visa, for example). I then tried my all-american card. No dice.</p>
<p>Google has been really problematic for us Puertorricans. I can&#8217;t publish paid apps in the market, while people from a lot of other places in the world can. If the Android device is not a phone (with a U.S. network IP address) and location is enabled, we can&#8217;t buy apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=16845">Cannot purchase paid apps from market on Asus EEE Pad Transformer.</a> I opened that issue more than a year ago. Still no official answer.</p>
<p>I had the same issue yesterday when I tried to pre-oder the Nexus 7. My registered address had US as country. I edited my address so that PR was now the country and it let me pre-order without any problems. Hope this helps!</p>
<p>PS- On the google play store it clearly says PR is supported so try to change your address to see if you&#8217;re successful and keep us posted!</p>
<p>Couple of things though. The OS seems like a blown up phone version. Where is the tablet layout?<br />
Some apps are showing the tablet layout though, so that is nice. Is the Android tablet layout definitly out? <br />
Another thing? Does the homescreen/launcher support landscape layout, or is it portrait only?</p>
<p>The tablet layout is still around for larger devices, Google decided that the phone layout worked better for this. After playing with a couple 7 inch tablets in the store, I kind of agree.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s portrait only, but I&#8217;m guessing you can install another launcher if you like. Still annoying.</p>
<p>That is so stupid. Same on the Galaxy Nexus, no landscape in the launcher. Plugin a MHL dongle and BAM, there you have landscape suddenly. I really think for a tablet they should have landscape on the homescreen, even if the OS uses a blown up version of the phone layout.</p>
<p>Yeah I agree, I wish they let you choose orientations.</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus dock and I&#8217;m personally glad the launcher stays in portrait, because landscape totally wrecks the widgets.</p>
<p>Android needs a better landscape widget experience, because it&#8217;s borderline awful.</p>
<p>Custom launchers can do landscape, although the dock still stays on the left or right.</p>
<p>I am really disappointed that they didn&#8217;t use the tablet layout for the home screen. To me it looks retarded with the phone layout.</p>
<p>Nice review.</p>
<p>My only worry is how OEMs Willard carriers will screw up Jelly Bean and the low pricing business model when offering such a tablet with LTE.</p>
<p>Verizon&#8230;.I&#8217;m looking at you&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to take a long time for the Nexus 7 to become available in more countries as Google hasn&#8217;t made a lot of content deals outside of the US and UK. And considering the low price point is made possible by the ecosystem bringing in the money, it would make no sense for Google to release the tablet in other countries.<br />
Maybe we&#8217;ll even have to wait for the Nexus 7 eventual succesor. Which sucks., because I really want it.</p>
<p>Hopefully this can push Amazon to release an Amazon Video app for all other Android devices.</p>
<p>Wooooooeow!!!! The world is coming to an end. Am selling my Rezound and getting the galaxy nexus and the nexus 7! From now on its pure Google, the way Martias Duarte intended it to be!</p>
<p>glad i pre-ordered</p>
<p>Considering it only had four months to be made this is pretty amazing.  I&#8217;m sort of on the fence about its lack of camera,  but I&#8217;ve always got a phone with a great camera so I guess it&#8217;s in no way a deal breaker.  What a great price!</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t made in 4 months.  It&#8217;s an ASUS tablet that already existed, which Google snatched up at the end of it&#8217;s development.  They added a new graphics card and motherboard in a few months.</p>
<p>Er I&#8217;m an idiot, I mean they dropped in a brand new SOC.</p>
<p>I know, I hadn&#8217;t read that article before this comment (above) was posted. I&#8217;d still say it&#8217;s a great price, and I&#8217;m very very close to pre-ordering. (I&#8217;m afraid of my own bank balance.)</p>
<p>Same I&#8217;m about a day or two from pre-ordering myself&#8230; I have a Galaxy Nexus though and the 7 inch tablet is so close to my own screen size.</p>
<p>It would make a nice complement I think. I&#8217;ve got a Sensation (4.3&quot;) and a Macbook Pro (13&quot;). 7&#8217; sits quite nicely, especially as a road going device. I&#8217;ve been looking for ages for something like it. Damnit. I just convinced myself.</p>
<p>Just one concern for the Nexus 7, I feel Google really missed a  huge opportunity to  incentivize developers to create tablet specific apps but instead by having phone apps scaled up, the tablet specific offerings in Google Play will remain weak. Other than that, kudos for Google IO and creating a very compelling android tablet.  I hope Amazon has something up their sleeve for their Kindle Fire update.</p>
<p>Android still clearly has issues with tablet&#8217;s UX. As Josh shows in the video, simply rotating the device wrecks a good UI. You also still have apps like Twitter that are literally a big phone UI.</p>
<p>Android doesn&#8217;t want &#8216;tablet only&#8217; or &#8216;tablet specific&#8217; apps, but clearly they need to do a bit more work to create a better overall user experience for tablet users with their strategy. I don&#8217;t see any technical reason why it can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<p>I think the point of this review is to say that the Android tablet experience is no longer poor. It has gotten better, and surely one of the most important factors in a review is price. A good cheap product will obviously score high. We&#8217;re not all made of money&#8230;</p>
<p>Ooops&#8230;wrong comment resposnsce&#8230;</p>
<p>Did you mean to respond to my comment? It would kinda fit.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe not.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t want tablet specific apps, but they do want apps that scale based on display size. What they don&#8217;t want is &#8216;[insert app name here] for tablets!&#8217;</p>
<p>The same principle applies to premium,  pro or paid apps: Google don&#8217;t want them in Google Play. Just use in-app purchases; in the long run you theoretically make more money anyway.</p>
<p>Unrealistic expectations. This is exactly how this conversation will go down.</p>
<p>Google: Here is a suitcase full of money. Please design your twitter app specifically for tablets.</p>
<p>Twitter: so let me get this straight? You designed Android to scale different screen sizes and resolutions but you don&#8217;t want me to use it? You want me to design an App specifically for each if these screen sizes? 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.7, 4.8, 5.3, 7, 7.7, 8.9, 10.1, and 13 inch screens all with different resolutions?</p>
<p>Google: yes I do because Apple fanboys keep on bringing it up and we want to eliminate this perceived weakness which really isn&#8217;t one.</p>
<p>Twitter: screw you.</p>
<p>No that&#8217;d be a terrible movie to force developers to only create tablet apps.  Developing apps for 4.0 look much better on tablets &#8211; the scaled up problem you see now is largely a result of developing for Gingerbread.  Regardless &#8211; giving out thousands of Jellybean tablets to devs will certainly be a kick in the pants.</p>
<p>8.8 seems a bit high, especially when you consider how dismal the Android tablet app experience is.</p>
<p>I can totally understand that it&#8217;s an 8+ given the review, but it feels you might have been a bit kind because of its given price.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;m super excited to see if Google can translate an awesome product like the Nexus 7 into tablet space success and maybe even a Nexus 10.</p>
<p>I think the point of this review is to say that the Android tablet experience is no longer poor. It has gotten better, and surely one of the most important factors in a review is price. A good cheap product will obviously score high. We’re not all made of money…</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good practice to factor in price into review scores because consumers will use the scores to do some basic comparison.</p>
<p>Why buy a 9.3 tablet that cost $500 when you can get an 8.8 that cost $200? Is that 0.5 points really worth that $300?</p>
<p>I hope you see what I mean by that.</p>
<p>I see your point but as a consumer, price does count. The $200 might be the difference between your kids getting new shoes and so you factor in the cost implications of your purchase. Thus, your 8.8 really does mean more because you weigh the benefits and problems up to find the middle ground you are happy with.</p>
<p>You have to factor price in the review. At least a responsible reviewer would. Not that I think Josh or anyone on the verge is a responsible reviewer but that is not the point.  The value is just as important as the display to some people and SHOULD be included in any decent review.</p>
<p>If consumers compare it the way you suggest, then they are stupid. The Nexus score of 8.8 should already factor in the price. If it was $519 like the iPad then it would most likely get a 7.8 or 8 tops. If the iPad was $199 like the Nexus 7, then the 9.3 would scale to a 10 easily. That is how consumers should look at reviews, they shouldn&#8217;t ignore value at all.</p>
<p>The only areas I would ignore in reviews due to my uses would be camera. In fact, I place value ahead of display and ecosystem probably.</p>
<p>great review, the score is justifying the device, I&#8217;m buying the device for sure, but hopefully it&#8217;ll has more tablet optimized apps in the future</p>
<p>Wait, Android&#8217;s homescreen is more &#8220;iOS-like&#8221; because it can auto-arrage the <strong>widgets</strong>? Is anyone noticing something wrong with that sentence?</p>
<p>Nope &#8211; auto arranging home screen items has been iOS behaviour since day one.</p>
<p>Auto-rearranges apps too. Josh just used widgets as the example because it works better with widgets, because they resize themselves etc.</p>
<p>Does anyone seem to know if an MHL HDMI adapter will work with this though from the microUSB port? The web appears to be bare&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not. Engadget had it in their review.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
And POO GOOGLE! BOO HISS!</p>
<p>I still bought one&#8230;</p>
<p>Looks like Microsoft might have to subsidise their Surface with app profit after all. LULZ</p>
<p>Maybe the Surface based on Windows RT, but not the Surface Pro. If I were even considering the Surface Pro (based on functionality and cost), I wouldn&#8217;t even be thinking about a Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Android can&#8217;t do what I (or most people that &#8220;need&#8221; Intel CPUs) would be doing on their Windows based devices. (without a remote connection)</p>
<p>I;m in Japan&#8230; BRING IT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111</p>
<p>Asia needs some love.<br />
Philippines is waiting on this.<br />
But that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>This would compliment my iPhone wonderfully.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what i&#8217;m thinking.</p>
<p>Josh, you&#8217;re great, but do you really think that the screen-squeeze-test matters in this age of feather-touch capacitive displays? I could understand the logic back when we were poking the Nokia 5800 with a stylus, but those days are gone. On a similar note, should you really be criticising a tablet for a thick bezel after countless hours gripping tablets and e-readers by spacious, half-inch borders? I think the heuristic that bezel=bad is dead as far as handheld devices goes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen those two gadget blog memes on The Verge before and I&#8217;m surprised to see them now.</p>
<p>I know its not an average of the separate scores, but 8.8 is a hell far waya from the 7.75. Should it be an iPad the comments would explode &#8230;</p>
<p>Granted some of the scores are more important than the others, even putting the top 4 scores for screen, performance, software and design together gives you just 8.5. This is bullshit josh, I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s merely because every category should be price-based. It&#8217;s just utter non-sense that this screen at $200 bucks got an 8. The 7 on battery and well, are you seriously telling me a 6 on camera should be given the same weight as software.</p>
<p>Their scoring system is bullshit, but the score is about right, this tablet is clearly the best tablet after the iPad (considering the price), and in some ways, it&#8217;s a much better deal. You can buy 3 of these with the same money you buy a 32 GB iPad.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is many reviews here do not feel price-based; lower-end devices which may make more compromises than necessary get absolutely hammered, and the lower price point is often mentioned in passing. If price point is going to become a real factor in these reviews, then The Verge has to work on a more consistent system.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s a different story if you talk percentages, but think about the number of laptops which were pitched against MacBooks that were hundreds of dollars above the price point of the laptop.</p>
<p>If there was a score for price, I imagine that would&#8217;ve shifted the average quite a bit.</p>
<p>I agree, but as i stated above even if you pick the highest marks it gets it nowhere near 8.8. Makes one wonder why he even bothered with the partial scores at all.</p>
<p>To provide an at-a-glance feel for how good particular properties of the tablet are, if you&#8217;re interested in those specific areas?</p>
<p>I think the extra points are given for the fact that this is finally a 7&quot; done right. There&#8217;s been a lot of crap that&#8217;s come before it and now, under the watch of Google, the 7&quot; has come good.</p>
<p>The tech press want to see a competitive landscape and if this failed, it could potentially be game over for Android on tablets. The platform that cried wolf. It makes sense for The Verge to give an extra boost to this as it does everything well, and if it sells could create a longed for alternative to Apple&#8217;s dominance.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>This is not adjusting, this is throwing the scores out of the window. I&#8217;m not disputing this tablet deserves 8.8, but the review should support the score at least a bit.</p>
<p>While understand what you&#8217;re saying. The review reflects the score, the problem seems to the sub scores.</p>
<p>I believe they should make an effort to get users to know that not only it isn&#8217;t a weighted average, but also that they don&#8217;t believe at all that camera and speakers, for example, are just there for reference and are absolutely secondary on a tablet review. It will probably go like this Software &gt; Screen &gt;&gt; everything else.</p>
<p>The first Android tablet that I want, and can actually afford!</p>
<p>As lovely as this looks, right now I own a 7&quot; last-gen Android tablet that I&#8217;ve been using as my <strong>sole</strong> device for 2 years.  Looks like I&#8217;ll have to wait for the ZTE T98 for a current gen device that can do it all (rear camera, 3g data,  phone)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so tempted to switch from my iPad 2 to this!</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t afford both? Jesus, it&#8217;s only a weekend&#8217;s hard labour, and the Nexus 7 is paid for&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>Android design chief Matias Duarte told me that the idea was to mimic &#8220;Steve McQueen&#8221; style driving gloves </blockquote><p>Oh Topolsky, what a name-dropper.</p>
<p>Yeah, this only makes me more excited for my Nexus 7 being delivered. ROLL ON JULY.</p>
<p>Pretty awesome little tablet, but the lack of a music service in the UK, and a general paucity of content in the rest of the English-speaking world beyond the USA and UK, is going to hinder it IMO. Nevertheless I am seriously considering either this or a W8 tablet, even as a British user. If they could get Google Music sorted out for a European release, that would be a great first step. I do really like Play Books, though &#8211; it deserves more success given Google&#8217;s efforts with digitising the world&#8217;s library.</p>
<p>There is a way around this if you can be bothered. You can&#8217;t purchase from Google music but you can set up streaming. I know it&#8217;s annoying and you shouldn&#8217;t have to spend five minutes to get it to work but it is possible. <br />
I&#8217;ve done it, and now i can&#8217;t wait for my Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Aye, I&#8217;ve done it as well.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still a pain that I can&#8217;t buy anything from the music store. :(</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a real chink in google&#8217;s plan if they&#8217;re selling the device at stock.</p>

<p>Seems like a great tablet, but no way i&#8217;m going smaller than 9.7 inch (iPad). <br />
It&#8217;s time for the Nexus 10.</p>
<p>I just preordered because others here did and I don&#8217;t want to feel left out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kinda sad :(</p>
<p>Not really. It&#8217;s worked for me my whole life.</p>
<p>Forever Alone</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s describing forever alone at all.<br />
He seems to be describing most of society actually.</p>
<p>Looks great. I&#8217;m gonna buy this one day!</p>
<p>So&#8230;the only reason to buy a Fire now is not knowing about the existence of this, right?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that is completely the case.<br />
If you have Amazon prime and really enjoy watching stuff on a 7&quot; tablet then Fire is your choice.<br />
Though with rumors of new Kindle announcements within a month or so it might be a silly one to make now.</p>
<p>well you can get refurbished or used Kindle Fires for a lot less than 200 but you could also just buy a Cheapo Ainol tablet from china if you really wanted to pinch pennies and didn&#8217;t care that your hardware will be outdated or crap</p>
<p>Why no microSD? It is a hd tablet, it has to hold a bunch of hd movies :(</p>
<p>In fact it can&#8217;t hold a single TV show&#8217;s season!</p>
<p>Yeah, i&#8217;m kinda bummed about this lack too.  It&#8217;s making me look into setting up some serious cloud storage for all of my media</p>
<p>Will the nexus work in countries that google currently aren&#8217;t shipping to? I am thinking of getting my hands on one of these puppies&#8230;.I think it hits a nice spot between price, weight and specs for e-reading&#8230;&#8230;any tips for getting this when it ships &#8211; or do I have to go &#8216;eBay style?&#8217;</p>
<p>i would buy one.. but in germany google play ist just APPs and Books.. <br />
we dont have music<br />
we dont have movies<br />
&#8230;.<br />
..</p>
<p>if you want a good ecosystem,  there is just apple.. and this sucks</p>
<p>Agree. If I lived in the US I would&#8217;t of thought twice about pre-ordering one. But in Germany? Not only that there is no content.. there isn&#8217;t even hope for any to come in the future.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>In the screenshot of the notification area (and in the video about 2:30) the string HTC EVA_UL36C2 is shown at the bootom of the notication area. Does anyone else think its strange that it says HTC???</p>
<p>That is the name of the wifi network that Josh was connected to at the time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming he was tethering from an HTC phone at the time.</p>
<p>Adding a MicroSD would have made it a much easier decision. But instead they placed Transformers and many magazines I&#8217;m not interested it.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting that the review would have come out this soon, thank you josh!</p>
<p>It seems like some people are mad at Google because twitter has not made any tablet version of twitter for Android . Odd. If a Dev  doesn&#8217;t want to do it, then so be it. It is the same for any os.</p>
<p>Ipad still has access to some apps which are phone formatted, so deal with it.</p>
<p>It is odd that an app as major as twitter would not be updated though.  And this is a review over what&#8217;s available to a customer of the tablet.</p>
<p>Point made though, I don&#8217;t know why Twitter won&#8217;t make an optimized version.</p>
<p>nice device.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m just wondering how much money they are making on this device. if the margins are razor thin then how much after sales support will there be and how sustainable can the Android tablet market be if other Android OEM&#8217;s can&#8217;t beat this device.</p>
<p>The problem with android is the OEMs.  Is this going to brake 3 times in one year like my current Asus computer did.  My iPad 2 has never broke on me.</p>
<p>How do you know? This is a tablet not a computer, it has about 10* less parts, and is made just as the iPad is. How are you so certain its gonna fail you?</p>
<p>Where is the 64GB Nexus 10?</p>
<p>This is gonna push the Android ecosystem so much&#8230; Just look at the Kindle Fire, it doesn&#8217;t even run normal Android, yet people have stuffed it with apps.</p>
<p>For me the price is great, i wish it had 3g or gps, but the price i can live without it. $200 tablet thats not complete junk. And will get direct google updates, cant beat that at all!</p>
<p>If Asus do a Nexus 7 + (with cellular) this will be an instant purchase.</p>
<p>It does have GPS.</p>
<p>Correct &gt; Sansung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for this to arrive! I love Amazon/Prime and all that but I&#8217;m glad I waited this one out. I can always just log into Amazon/use the app anyway :P</p>
<p>I pre-ordered mine day one. I&#8217;m excited to say the least. I sold my Kindle Fire to help fund this latest purchase, so I&#8217;m without a dedicated e-reader for a couple of weeks, but I have the feeling it will be worth it.</p>
<p>More of a general Q, in Jelly Bean 4.1, is there a decent file system?<br />
One thing that would be ideal would be I able to access photos, music and files on a NAS drive in their actual folder rather than through a media app? I dont remember being able to do this when I had the Archos G9 80 with Honeycomb.<br />
For purely web use, email and streaming music, how does BB Playbook compare? The 16GB Model is basically the same price of £169 over here for the 8GB Nexus 7 . Tempting.</p>
<p>just use ES file explorer</p>
<p>Thanks, that looks spot on!</p>
<p>Really, REALLY impressed with the Jelly Beans. UI looks like something one can pile works in, not just a pretty face with redundant animations that got in the way of works. Ooh and wow only last a few hours, you know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still iffy on them changing up the tablet UI to match the phone UI. It just looks awkward to me.</p>
<p>A rear facing camera would have really sealed the deal on this one.</p>
<p>Agreed. Probably couldn&#8217;t happen at this price  point though.</p>
<p>Agreed, though I would not mind paying a little extra for that.</p>
<p>I think&#8230; I need one of these. As soon as possible.</p>
<p>Vlad would have given this tablet a 6/10.</p>
<p>iPad 2 is still better</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is any information about an international release (Germany)?</p>
<p>Great review Josh , i like the long video review for the curious people who don&#8217;t want to read all the review (which i did at the end )</p>
<p>Maybe in the next tablet review the writer could tell more about what the device is actually used for and why it&#8217;s better at it than your phone or laptop?</p>
<p>I think they are expecting most people to figure out that the screen is a little bigger than your phone and the whole thing is smaller and less cumbersome and less intrusive physically than your laptop.<br />
Also, while a lot of people do have smart phones not everyone does.<br />
And you could buy this tablet and use it on your couch on your wifi (where most tablets do get used) for the price of a couple of months charge for a smart phone data plan.<br />
And a laptop is a crappy way to read in bed in a prone position.<br />
I could go on and on with obvious stuff but&#8230;</p>
<p>Email, web browsing, videos, ebooks, gaming, light productivity.</p>
<p>Anything else? If you can&#8217;t figure out what to use a tablet for, they&#8217;re not for you.</p>
<p>So stoked, can&#8217;t wait till my device gets delivered. This hopefully will sell really well and developers will start making apps designed for the 7 inch for factor. This is basically to jump start the android tablet app selection (and obviously the ecosystem purchases).</p>
<p>What is the point of Google Now if this doesn&#8217;t have a cellular connection?</p>
<p>Wifi, use your phone as a hotspot</p>
<p>It will be somewhat less useful then on devices which are always connected.<br />
But you have to remember that 4.1 isn&#8217;t only for this device.<br />
It&#8217;s just that this device is launching with it.<br />
&#8220;Google Now&#8221; is a much bigger play in the long run.</p>
<p>*then should be &#8216;than&#8217;.<br />
But of course there should also be an effing &#8216;edit&#8217;.</p>
<p>The same people on this forum called the original iPad a big iPhone or iPod Touch. Now this thing, which truly is just a big phone, is a justifiable purchase. The kicker is most of you already have 4&quot;-5&quot; phones running the exact same apps. Clueless as to who this for really. I think it&#8217;s only a suitable purchase for those carrying a flip phone, can&#8217;t afford a real tablet, and still who want access apps while at the airport or in the bathroom.</p>
<p>I would normally agree with you, but for the price. £159 makes this a justifiable purchase for the times (albeit few) where this is a bit better than your supersize phone or your heavier 10&quot; tablet / Ultrabook.</p>
<p>Not for everyone,but for quite a few.</p>
<p>The context is not the same.<br />
That was then, this is now &#8211; as the saying goes.</p>
<p>I do agree with you though that you seem to be clueless about it.</p>
<p>I own a Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Xoom, and a 15.6&quot; laptop. I just pre-ordered this because the Xoom will be given to my parents and I feel 7&quot; is a better form factor for how I was using the Xoom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve pre-ordered mine.  Now WHERE IS IT GOOGLE!!! I hate waiting&#8230;</p>
<p>Does a GPS chip + &#8220;offline&#8221; Google Maps mean that you can download map data on WIFI and then use the GPS to get your current position on it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes &#8211; but it won&#8217;t do navigation turn-by-turn for you offline.<br />
But it will show your position.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be picking one up.  I&#8217;ve wanted to try my hand at Android development and this is the first decent opportunity IMO (for someone that already has an iPhone and iPad).  $200 but it&#8217;s a real Google device that will get first class updates, and the type of market penetration that warrants apps to be specifically developed for it.</p>
<p>Also might make another nice toy :)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird how all of the comments so far are ignoring the elephant in the room: Amazon.</p>
<p>- Rumors are swirling about Amazon bringing out a Kindle Fire 2 any day now. Which will probably be as good as or better than the N7, hardware-wise. And maybe Amazon will surprise us with their next version of Fire-Android which will a few killer features that Jelly Bean lacks.</p>
<p>- It won&#8217;t surprise me at all if Amazon undercuts the N7 on price. Because that&#8217;s what Amazon does.</p>
<p>- Google has a <em>terrible</em> track record for selling hardware directly. Everyone seems to assume that they&#8217;ll magically do better this time around. Maybe. Or maybe this will be Google&#8217;s usual trainwreck of screwed up orders, slow shipments, and poor customer service. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>- Overall, my guess is that the N7 will enjoy a brief moment of fame, then will be forgotten when the KF2 eclipses it. It might be worth buying as a collector&#8217;s item. I think it&#8217;s moment in the sun is right now, today. A month from now, it will be a technological footnote.</p>
<p>You might be right. I really don&#8217;t understand why they want to kick Amazon AND OEM&#8217;s in the groin for a tablet that they are not planning on selling as a mass market product (only online), at no profit, and as recent analyses has shown, very little profit from online ads, app sales, etc. Seems like a really good way to destroy relationships and tease Amazon into a reaction.</p>
<p>They are not going to be sold only online.<br />
And Google is a search company foremost at the moment.<br />
But in its crystal ball it easily sees that things like facebook and IOS appstore and Amazon&#8217;s ecosystem are becoming more and more prominent and do not offer full access for search.<br />
Google has to get into these spaces to be able to keep doing what it does or in a few years or ten it will have found itself completely shut out and shutting down.<br />
Google does not need other manufacturers at this point as much as they need it.<br />
It has Motorola now and if it needed to could very quicly pivot to a top-to-bottom company just like Apple is.<br />
I don&#8217;t think that is their plan but it is a hell of a backup situation for it to have.</p>
<p>I thought I in the review they will only be sold in the play store? If thats not the case, than this has to be a success on the iPad scale to risk alienating OEMs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see what the ecosystem has to do with creating hardware. They can do that for OEMs. Although I have to say that I think Google vastly overestimated Android revenue. Also, for those companies you mention, the ecosystem is not the main source of revenue. What is the play then? They have a mobile ad company that can be found in iOS apps , right? What good does controlling the ecosystem do them?</p>
<p>Google might be needed by OEMs, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too late to create a competitor. A lot of OEM&#8217;s already have some content deals in place. Apps might be a problem, but android doesn&#8217;t exactly have a surplus of apps, and if they are easily ported then there goes that advantage. This might be the time to introduce a great tablet OS.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with you on Motorola, I think Google has very little faith in them as a hardware company. But that&#8217;s just speculation. Google has to be EXTREMELY sure that entering the hardware space will be a success before they pull that stunt.</p>
<p>Gamestop in the US has already announced they will be selling it and are in fact taking pre-orders for it.<br />
I doubt they will be the only one.<br />
For Amazon the ecosystem certainly is the main source of revenue.<br />
It isn&#8217;t for Apple, but if you think that 30% they take off the top if of no interest to them then I would disagree.<br />
The problem is that Google sells ads.<br />
And to effectively sell those ads in the future it needs access to data &#8211; because that is the way the ad industry is going.<br />
It also needs to be able to be in a place where people will see those ads.<br />
If Google can&#8217;t search the resources that people are looking for then it will cease to have screentime/presence to sell the ads.<br />
Facebook is closed and doesn&#8217;t allow search by Google.<br />
Amazon marketplace and Apple marketplace are also places where people spend time and give information &#8211; which google probably can&#8217;t search well.<br />
That is why Google needs Google+<br />
I don&#8217;t think it has huge interest in the revenue from Play just like that money isn&#8217;t the primary thing on Apple&#8217;s plate right now.<br />
But it needs to at least have competing products in these areas in the long run so it can harvest data and place ads, etc&#8230;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what Google is doing with Motorolla.<br />
Maybe it will even sell it as has been rumored.<br />
But I don&#8217;t see why.</p>
<p>Say you are right about other companies simply doing their own OS.<br />
I don&#8217;t actually think you are but let&#8217;s say so.<br />
So say this fall Samsung and Asus and Acer and HG all announce that they will cease making Android devices and are forming a partnership which will use its own OS.<br />
Well &#8211; Google would be royally screwed.<br />
But they wouldn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
Because with Motorolla in their back pocket they could pivot almost instantly.<br />
Certainly within one product cycle anyway.<br />
They could not only still have Android hardware out there but they could leverage the same strengths Apple does.  That means fragmentation and difficulty of porting the OS to 20 kinds of hardware setups etc all go away.</p>
<p>Like I said, I don&#8217;t think it is their intent.<br />
The way they&#8217;ve been doing it has been successful enough so far.<br />
But it is a hell of a backup plan.<br />
They&#8217;d be fools to sell off Motorlla.</p>
<p>Actually what they should do is buy dish network and use motorolla to build the boxes for it with Google TV on board.  Then put ad placement in the channel guide and use the revenue to allow them to lower the rates on services.</p>
<p>Ecosystem means apps to me. Amazon makes it&#8217;s money on content, not the apps. The 30% Apple gets is of some interest, sure. But that&#8217;s still not where they make their money.</p>
<p>Mobile ads have yet to produce real revenue. In fact, a lot of companies are struggling with the transition to mobile, not just google. I personally think that the &#8220;dream&#8221; (or nightmare) of highly personalized ads is not the future. Too much activity by lawmakers in that space, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>In any case, it might be a future play, but it&#8217;d pretty much a gamble right now.</p>
<p>Ok, so google + is more important than an ecosystem in terms of data? I would agree with that. They also don&#8217;t need an ecosystem to show the ads.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re assuming that motorola is capable of producing amazing hardware on par with samsung&#8230;and motorola is nonexistent in Europe, and I&#8217;d imagine a number of other continents.fragmentation goes away, but so does diversity, and build quality.</p>
<p>Interesting idea, although I smell channel conflict with that plan.</p>
<p>Some good points, but dont forget that the Kindle Fire was US only, and I can&#8217;t see that changing for the KF2. It seems odd that Google would want to push out the fire though, given it was leading tablets for android.</p>
<p>But then you have to consider that a pure tablet at this cost will motivate a lot of people to pay out, and the developers will come running when the user-base is there. I think that&#8217;s the main idea here</p>
<p>I think your giving Amazon too much credit.  The Fire was basically a rebadged playbook.  Asus has way more experience producing this kind of hardware.</p>
<p>Do you really believe the &quot; next version of Fire-Android which will a few killer features that Jelly Bean lacks?&quot;  The fire runs a forked version of android (gingerbread) that is pretty gimped.  Right now the software isn&#8217;t in the same class.</p>
<p>Yup, I do. Mostly because Google and Amazon have different agendas and are taking Android in different directions. So, sure, I can see Amazon&#8217;s Android being outdated and feature-sparse compared to Google&#8217;s in some ways, but bringing in some very compelling features in areas that Google isn&#8217;t focused on. Like media library management, for example. That&#8217;s an area where both iOS and Android are pretty weak, but is right at the heart of Amazon&#8217;s bread &amp; butter. They might decide to integrate a good solution directly into their Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;and basic tasks like multitasking were nearly instantaneous.&#8221;</p>
<p>nearly. lol.</p>
<p>Great review&#8230;&#8230;..ordered a nexus 7&#8230;&#8230;..my better half will be inheriting my iPad.</p>
<p>Seems like a great tablet, but one hell of a bad move for google.</p>
<p>It clearly doesn&#8217;t see this as a mass market product (only selling it online), but it spoils the market for every OEM out there. Selling it at cost really makes it unbeatable. And as others said, it sure puts pressure on Amazon, which has the power to make a big move here.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t get the strategy.</p>
<p>You pretty much summed it up. It&#8217;s not about revenue it&#8217;s more  so about flooding the market to get more users on AndroidOS. They saw was Amz did and want some of that action.</p>
<p>Yeah, that could be it, but what would be the benefit? Android isn&#8217;t really generating revenue, and amazon of course just wants you to buy content. Maybe I&#8217;m underestimating content revenue for Google.</p>
<p>I was strongly considering the SGS3 next month, but after seeing this a link up of the Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus might be a stronger option for me. It would be really useful for developing also to have a tablet preloaded with jellybean for testing quickly and not relying on the emulator</p>
<p>The SGS3 does look nice, but in the end is it worth paying a premium for quad-core(assuming you get it in Italy) and slower updates, versus a cheaper phone(Galaxy Nexus) with an almost as nice screen that&#8217;s going to get Jelly Bean very soon and will likely get the next major update soon after the new Nexus launches?</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus and tend to get the new Nexus every year. I don&#8217;t <em>need</em> a tablet(I doubt many people do, really) but for Netflix and reading, £159 is a hell of a deal.</p>
<p>This is pretty much my thinking. The S3 has some really nice software, but the idea of updates a month after release just sways me away from it. Plus jelly bean seems to creep upon some of the S3 features anyway. Plus, given if I spend around 300-350 on the nexus/500 on the S3, the price gap almost makes up for the tablet!</p>
<p>As for getting it in Italy, its released here, but I am moving back to the UK in 2 weeks for at least a year, and the nexus phone/tablet together would be a nice way to start the year don&#8217;t you think!</p>
<p>Been waiting for a sub-$250 7&quot; with no compromises to supplement the iPad that my wife uses most of the time ;).  Looks like this is it&#8230;just ordered.  Thanks for the quick review, Josh!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite a feat how cheap this is for how much you get.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t even 1.5 years ago that Motorola was trying to sell the Xoom, which is worse in almost every way except screen size and mobile connectivity, for 4x the price.</p>
<p>This makes me reassess how much phones should be costing, especially with carrier subsidies.</p>
<blockquote> Later, when I left the hotel for the airport, Google Now presented me with a map and an estimated travel time of 27 minutes without having been asked to do so.</blockquote>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>Ecosystem 7/10 – even though Android is still seriously lacking tablet-optimized apps. I get that you get easily excited by new gadgets, Josh, but that&#8217;s really not an objective rating. The rest of the review is great, though.</p>
<p>No rating as a decision by a human is objective.</p>
<p>There really is a fair amount of tablet optimized app&#8217;s. And as the review said, when it comes to the difference between a 4 inch phone and a 7 inch tablet it really isn&#8217;t that great a difference. Ecosystem is not simply rated on how many columns the official twitter app can hold! Plus its a review, its never going to be objective.</p>
<p>Was really hoping to see a sample of how that camera/mic worked in Google hangouts or similar.<br />
Every review mentions it is designed for that and then completely ignores testing it.</p>
<p>Also &#8211; how could you tease that you got a camera app to work with the camera and then not post any samples at all, Josh?<br />
I mean we all know it is meant to be nothing more than serviceable but it is still a review.<br />
I&#8217;d love to actually see a couple of shots with it to look at for myself.</p>
<p>Very true, but it was a 3am post the man was boarding a red-eye &#8211;  maybe he wanted to look fresh for the cam :P</p>
<p>Hope they add a video today.</p>
<p>Should be simple as I am pretty sure you can save and publish hangouts to youtube.<br />
So just do a hangout with a couple of people, at least one of them using a Nexus 7.<br />
Do a few tests with it and then post the whole thing to youtube and put a link up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why a prominent Tech blog site would still be using Flash for its videos&#8230;WTF &#8220;The Verge&#8221; Its time to move on. I cant watch your videos on chrome browser for mobile and ironically if i wanted to watch your video review of the Nexus 7 on a Nexus 7, i sadly would not be able to, because flash is not supported. Again&#8230; WTF</p>
<p>I believe they have to use Flash to serve ads.</p>
<p>I doubt it. Google is all about adds and there no longer supporting Flash in Jelly bean or in there flagship browser.</p>
<p>&#8220;ironically if I wanted to watch your video review of the Nexus 7 on a Nexus 7, I sadly would not be able to, because flash is not supported.&#8221;</p>
<p>The video plays fine for me. Sent from my (flash-free) iPad. So I reckon you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>This  player does offer  a mobile compatible version of all videos. This non-flash version is working fine right now on i-phone. What device and operating system are you having issues with? Please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@theverge.com" target="_blank">support@theverge.com</a> .  We will look into it pronto. Thanks.</p>
<p>There will always be a better device coming out. This one meets my needs for browsing, email, books and some video and music content at a price point that is not going to break the bank. Trigger pulled.</p>
<p>Now where&#8217;s my Nexus 10?</p>
<p>I know everyone is screaming where&#8217;s the apps, but with android phones running at around 5&quot; is it really such a bad thing to run a phone app on a 7&quot; tablet?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got little issue running some of these &#8220;phone&#8221; apps on my Xoom. Would it be nice to have a dedicated tablet app instead? Sure but it&#8217;s not a deal breaker.</p>
<p>So no, running these apps on a 7&quot; screen when my phone is 4.65&quot; won&#8217;t be an issue at all. It won&#8217;t be long until there is more Android tablet support for Android.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t decide if I should buy this or a new nexus phone in November.</p>
<p>Not to be negative, but, here&#8217;s some things to think about: HDMI, OTG, MHL, SD, CAM, and, 5.9 GB available free on the 8 GB model.</p>
<p>If you can live w/ this, then OK.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts:<br />
HDMI &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
OTG &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
MHL &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
SD slot &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
CAM &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
8/16GB total &#8211; don&#8217;t care</p>
<p>You know I was there with the HDMI port. Not with the other features you mentioned. But it makes sense,  20 minutes later they presented the Nexus Q, I think Google&#8217;s idea is to connect your tv with your devices through the Q, and not directly, which is way more comfortable if you just think about it. And now that I&#8217;m writting this IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never understood the fascination of hooking up your phone or tablet to a HDTV. I have better and more capable devices to do that with.</p>
<p>Nhat&#8217;s, don&#8217;t you care that you will only be able to install 5 to 8 high end apps (games) on the 8 gig model.  Sry, that will matter a few months down the road.</p>
<p>Would you also buy a corvette, with a fast engine, but w/ a 6 gallon gas tank?</p>
<p>I have 32GB on my Galaxy Nexus and I have yet to use half of that space. I agree that 8GB is far too small but that&#8217;s what the cloud is for.</p>
<p>A lot of people bought the Bugatti Veyron even though it gets terrible MPGs and doesn&#8217;t have a large enough gas tank.</p>
<p>It sounds like a certain few people in the comments have forgotten that this is supposed to take on the Kindle Fire and not the iPad. Let it be already.</p>
<p>Good point; and by the way, TheVerge score for the Nexus 7 comes to 7.75.  Just saying.</p>
<p>you can do that with all their scores, the only people who point it out though are the people who disagree i guess (we can smell our own lol)</p>
<p>This is $200, yet a phone still costs me like $700 unlocked&#8230; I totally get it, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t get it at all haha.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t charge a ton for phones expecting you to buy them they charge a ton so that you will buy them From a carrier subsidized. It a conspiracy with the carriers..</p>
<p>You have the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>They charge a bunch because they can. Carriers give subsidies so phone makers are now trying to take advantage of this fact.</p>
<p>Horse&#8217;s can totally be trained to push a cart&#8230; haha</p>
<p>Well, this is a biased review. It all reads as if the author truly WANTS to like this piece of hardware.</p>
<p>I give this review a 5.1/10.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t think so, i actually thought this guy was more biased towards apple (from his older reviews), i think i was wrong because this is a good review and it finally sounds like android for tablets is coming into fruition (like it already has for smartphones)</p>
<p>Josh has been a bigger fan of Android since they came out with 4.0 and the Nexus.</p>
<p>so he is biased because it&#8217;s not good? i don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t follow. Clearly this is a good device and Josh has been a fan of Android&#8217;s OS much more so since 4.0 because it is far more versatile than iOS. The device is $200 and it performs like a top contender for it&#8217;s size. Are you just trying to troll?</p>
<p>word, no trolling just misunderstanding :)</p>
<blockquote> because it is far more versatile than iOS.</blockquote>
<p>first, i would avoid making sweeping statements with a strong sense of bias. Are there not enough flame wars in this thread for your liking?</p>
<p>isn&#8217;t that what makes android different from iOS? it&#8217;s versatility?</p>
<p>Bumping the scope from 7.75 to 8.8, without any explanation, sounds like this might be the case.</p>
<p>Wanna read a review of this same tablet from a devout Apple fanboi&#8217;s point of view?</p>

<p>nexus 7 w/amazon content &gt; ipad&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..if only :(</p>
<p>An 8.8 on the Verge? I will have to pick one up. From the looks of the video when Josh was demoing the search, it felt much snappier than Siri. I&#8217;m excited for this. Gonna have to buy one before the semester begins! Great review!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not sure what Siri does that&#8217;s any better than what we saw here.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s snarky</p>
<p>well, i tried &quot;find local sushi resturants: on my ipad. (obviously iOS 6)</p>
<p>Instead of  giving me the first result on a map, it gave me 15 results, in a very nice (non linen i might add, just semi transparent and very flat) format, in order of nearest to me, to furthest, along with address, average yelp star review and average cost of food (in a 1-5 $$ kind of way)</p>
<p>clicking once on any gives you the option to call or map it out.</p>
<p>Generally waht people go on siri about is it&#8217;s context. You can set an alarm, and then 2 hours later ask siri to &#8220;change that last alarm&#8221; &#8220;cancel tomorrow&#8217;s alarm&#8221; the understanding of context in human speech.</p>
<p>to me, that part, and the geofencing (siri knows where you are) were always the more interesting aspects of the tech rather than wolfram.</p>
<p>That, for sure, is a definite advantage for Siri.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m sure we could agree that both techs are very nice</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting this for my mom for her 76th birthday.</p>
<p>I have absolutely, positively, <strong>NO desire</strong> to own this thing.</p>
<p>But at $200, I&#8217;m sure as hell gonna buy one.</p>
<p>Possibly the most honest, and funny post, so far.</p>
<p>+1 for Pride and Prejudice :-)</p>
<p>Half of the Play store Content is not available outside the US, so even with this score and Price point the tablet is of no use anywhere outside the US, which is a shame.</p>
<p>A few reminders:</p>
<p>This thing will NOT sell a lot of units unless it gets picked up by a retailer that wants to advertise it like crazy.</p>
<p>Ipad has more commercials on TV and Billboards than all other tablets combined times ten.  Even with great product you have to market them if you want people to buy a lot.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that Apple is a marketing company as much as it is a computer company with great products and great ads.</p>
<p>Nexus devices are for developers, hackers, and technology enthusiasts, not for the general public.  Jelly Bean is a way more refined than previous versions of android.  I&#8217;m running it on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus and I love it.  It&#8217;s very good.</p>
<p>can something like this play amazon instant video just fine? <br />
i have a kindle and love using prime for some tv series</p>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s an app for that</p>
<p>cool &#8211; hopefully someone can demonstrate how this app looks on the nexus 7</p>
<p>If I have an Ipad why would I want to buy this? (serious question)</p>
<p>If I own a Porsche GT3RS, why would I want to buy a Ferrari 458? (not so serious question)</p>
<p>to impress the ladies?</p>
<p>Underhung?</p>
<p>You might not want to.  The iPad is pretty nice.  I have the iPad 3, but I just signed up to buy one of these (it&#8217;s the google now thing that&#8217;s really pulling me in) and I&#8217;m going to sell my iPad as soon as it gets here.</p>
<p>But to answer your question better, I think the google now thing is a pretty killer feature.  Always have a mapped/time estimated route back to a place you need to go is awesome.  It&#8217;s light, probably not as scratch prone (at least not the back) and it&#8217;s tossable&#8230;  You&#8217;re less likely to get mugged for it.  You don&#8217;t look as ostentatious carrying it around.  You get geek cred.  It&#8217;s lighter, so you won&#8217;t develop as many strange, before unseen medical ailments from it (Think Wii related pains from a few years back).  Additionally, Android is better integrated (easier to share things more ways) and has less throwback design influence.  ICS is awesome, if you don&#8217;t know.  I assume Jelly Bean is awesomer.  :-)</p>
<p>&gt;You’re less likely to get mugged for it</p>
<p>I am sold. I am getting one for every one of my family members.</p>
<p>bahaha</p>
<p>I dunno where you must be to encounter thieves with discerning tastes.<br />
A thief is a thief.</p>
<p>I live on the earth, where more money can be had for a stolen iPad than a stolen Nexus 7.</p>
<p>What planet are you from?</p>
<p>haha! the same one that a thief won&#8217;t second guess anything if they&#8217;re going to steal. Money could be had with either item, you really think a thief is keen enough/will be able to sell something at fair market price.  Let me know when somebody does a report on a thieves likelihood to be a product snob.</p>
<p>Again a thief is a thief.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re equating thieves with fools.  They&#8217;re clearly not all stupid, just immoral.</p>
<p>For some reason the mods don&#8217;t want us to dance.  Perhaps we should sit this one out.  While I disagree with your arguments, you dance just fine.</p>
<p>good question, but for $200 you can put it in the &#8220;why the f@#$ not&#8221; category</p>
<p>This looks awesome but i love how google just screwed every manufacture that makes android tablets by selling this at cost.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Microsoft just pull a similar move?</p>
<p>I could be wrong but I don&#8217;t think Microsoft could sell the surface at cost. Yea they might make some money from their app store but not nearly enough to justify it.</p>
<p>This is similar to what they did with the Nexus One.  The manufacturers aren&#8217;t living up to their end of the bargain, so they are stimulating the market.  I suspect the other manufacturers will follow with better hardware quickly.</p>
<p>Oh and they screwed every manufacturer except Asus, but for most manufacturers, these are niche products, not given much effort, so it shouldn&#8217;t hit them too hard.</p>
<p>Yea i don&#8217;t really understand &#8220;who&#8217;s&#8221; cost? is it the cost to make the tablet? Or google&#8217;s cost to buy the tablet? If its the cost to make the tablet google must be paying asus a little extra.</p>
<blockquote>In fact, it’s the first Android tablet that I can confidently recommend to buyers — and not just because it’s got a low price tag (though that certainly helps). </blockquote>
<p>Hm, I find it hard to believe that Josh has spent that much time with many Android tablets if he feels this way.  My $400 Asus tablet with 32 GB of storage, 10 inch screen, and the same processor feels and performs pretty damn well.</p>
<p>But, does it perform better than an iPad? That&#8217;s really the question for tablets. This does in many ways.</p>
<p>Well, I think my tablet also generally performs as well as the iPad.</p>
<p>i think the key word is &#8220;confidently&#8221;, while the Asus tablets are great the normal consumer should probably buy an ipad, and i would have to agree with that</p>
<p>How is the screen brightness? Anandtech&#8217;s minireview shows that the Nexus 7&#8217;s screen is even dimmer than the Touchpad&#8217;s, and the Touchpad&#8217;s screen is too dim for me even at maximum brightness. Can you please comment on this? Thanks.</p>
<p><a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/google-nexus-7-8gb/4505-3126_7-35338333-2.html?tag=rvwBody;paginate" target="_blank">http://reviews.cnet.com/tablets/google-nexus-7-8gb/4505-3126_7-35338333-2.html?tag=rvwBody;paginate</a></p>
<p>They have a breakdown comparison of brightness and more.</p>
<p>Just saw a TV commercial for the Kindle Fire, and made me think that Google is going to have to advertise this to a Amazon or Apple level if they want this to succeed as well at the Fire. Has anyone seen any TV commercials for this, or heard if Google is planning any?</p>
<p>I love the use of non-expensive, yet distinctive and pleasant materials, i.e. for the back.</p>
<p>I want this but I already have GT10.1 and a Galaxy Nexus w/ Jelly Bean.  I might sell the GT10.1 to buy this, but I am afraid that I will miss the bigger screen and rear facing camera.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and to all the people saying that taking pictures with a tablet is stupid, I&#8217;ll give you a few uses.</p>
<p>1. During Video Chat showing first person view.<br />
2. Taking pictures of cool things happening in front of you when you&#8217;re at home hanging out with friends and family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not something I would ever use to take pictures with out in public.  But I rarely use my tab in public.  Mostly it&#8217;s for browsing while on vacation, at private meetings to share content. and home use.  Tablets are too big to be just carrying them around.</p>
<p>I have seen people just carrying them around.  (get a better phone with a bigger screen)</p>
<p>I guess I will never understand when Verge commenters became so one sided.</p>
<p>Which side is that?</p>
<p>Do you really have to ask? The verge is a haven for Apple fanboys. Haha</p>
<p>Very nice tablet. Now lets just hope that developers would start making apps for tablet.</p>
<p>Not unless marketshare picks up.</p>
<p>Looks awesome! Definitely THE tablet for the masses. I&#8217;m also getting the feeling that when I eventually actually buy a tablet, I&#8217;d prefer it to be roughly this size. 10&quot; still seems a bit big to me.</p>
<p>Typo: "It then repeated this magic when I landed I landed"<br />
Should be: It then repeated this magic when I landed</p>
<p>The Verge claimed that the Lumia 900 had a weak app selection and they gave the ecosystem a rating of 4.0. Then they say that Android tablets have a small app selection(probably smaller then Windows Phone) and they give the ecosystem a 7.0 rating. What gives?</p>
<p>One you are comparing a phone to a tablet, and two, they are indicating poor selection of tablet specific software, but most of all those other Android apps are still able to run on this, just not geared towards a tablet.</p>
<p>In my experience most Android phone apps run horribly on tablets. For me it wasn&#8217;t even worth installing most phone apps. But that&#8217;s just my opinion I guess.</p>
<p>Fair, but this is more of a micro-tablet. It is far closer in size to a phone (in feel) than a full tablet.</p>
<p>In my experience, it is quite opposite. Most apps I have on my phone run perfectly well on my Xoom with ICS.</p>
<p>Well for one this will drive the tablet ecosystem up in a matter of weeks, due to its cheap pricing and attractive features (look at the Kindle Fire). The Lumia 900 is now stuck with whatever apps there are right now, with no incentive for developers to make more.</p>
<p>There is plenty of incentive for devs to make more apps for Windows Phone. Mainly Windows 8. Windows Phone and Windows 8 share the exact same kernel which makes porting Windows apps over to Windows Phone a piece of cake. When Windows 8 is released expect the size of the Windows Phone marketplace to grow even faster then it already is.</p>
<p>What incentive? The Lumia 900 won&#8217;t even receive Windows 8.</p>
<p>I was talking about the Windows Phone OS, not the Lumia 800.</p>
<p>Because Android is better than Windows for now. Duh! Unless you actually think Windows phone 7.5 currently has better apps than Android 4.1?</p>
<p>This may change with Windows 8 though if they can successfully merge Windows 8 pro, RT, Wind0ws Phone 8 into one cohesive family.</p>
<p>This tablet looks really impressive.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the review was made in TheVerge office, without all that euphoria from the Google IO marketing. The device looks really promising, but I&#8217;m always suspicious when the review ends with the word &#8220;period&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lets not forgot that this is a pure Google Tablet that will get upgrades and love directly from Google. The main reason i want it&#8230;It is a NEXUS! That&#8217;s it, pure and simple. Love the price, love android, and of course the Google ecosystem. I&#8217;m ordering 2 of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, having that smirk when Android 5.0 comes out and this is the first tablet to get it, while newer, more capable tablets wait 4 months &#8211; never. :P</p>
<p>In terms of value the nexus 7 is a clear winner over the iPad. It has 90% (if not more) of the features, a shiner OS, yet costs 40%. There is now no longer a reason  to spring for an iPad, unless one is rich and only desires the best.</p>
<p>i agree, i hope they market it properly though</p>
<p>Landscape mode! Can Nexus 7 turn to landscape mode? Especially in Chrome can we view the web page in full screen + landscape mode? It seems to me all photos are taken in portrait mode&#8230;</p>
<p>I pray someone answers this. If I buy this, can I tv-out to my lcd tv and watch slingplayer or whatever happens to be on the screen?</p>
<p>No, this has been answered many times before.</p>
<p>My only question &#8211; this is around the ecosystem score.</p>
<p>How can this get a 7 in the ecosystem when there are basically no such thing as Android tablet apps?</p>
<p>Probably because Android 4.1 is a great ecosystem regardless of their app philosophy? What are you going to do? Give a great and flexible OS a zero because app developers prefer not to use the scaling features properly?</p>
<p>Anyways, if you want to nitpick every single score there are much more glaring discrepencies than the one you pointed out. Like the fact that the new iPad got a 10 in battery life for being much worse than the iPad2 battery life while this got a 7 for being quite good for a tiny battery.</p>
<p>Just calling for consistency, that&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>Ecosystem to me isn&#8217;t just the OS &#8211; it&#8217;s all the surrounding parts that make it an ecosystem &#8211; and right now, this doesn&#8217;t have it.</p>
<p>Tons of reviewers do not use consistency in their reviews, like the example I used from the  iPad 3 review. I mean it takes 50 million times longer to charge and doesn&#8217;t last nearly as long as the ipad2 and Galaxy tab 7.7 and it gets a 10 in battery life.</p>
<p>I figured that people would realize by now that the reviewers impression of the device skewers the scores in all areas. If the reviewer likes the product, he will overlook more things than you and I might. That is human nature and everyone, no matter how unbiased they think they might be, has biases.</p>
<p>If we want truly objective and consistent scores for each sub section of a review, we would have to start letting robots do the reviews. Otherwise, we are not going to all agree on the scores.</p>
<p>I personally think that a 7 is way too low considering this is a new major OS release that brings some genuinely excellent features to the table.</p>
<p>So would you give the ecosystem a higher score if this was a 4.65 inch phone instead? I disagree with that.</p>
<p>7 is actually pretty low considering Jelly Bean is in any ways better than IOS6.</p>
<p>Honestly, they were better off just leaving the name ICS (Ice Cream Sandwhich) and tagging 4.1 next to it.</p>
<p>A .1 increments needs a new OS name? Should of left Jellybean for 5.0, but I guess that&#8217;s for Key Lime Pie&#8230; err v4.1.1</p>
<p>Seems you don&#8217;t know how Android releases are labeled. 1.0 increases reservered for major updates and 0.1 releases are for minor updates and 0.0.1 are bug fixes for the firmware. The next Android release will be 4.2.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as an Android tablet app, you should try looking before you misspeak.</p>
<p>This tablet is capable of running any app in the Google Play store, that is enough to warrant the 7.0 score.</p>
<p>No landscape mode and lack oif the nice tablet home screen interface are two turn downs of this tablet for me but i believe will be easily &#8220;repaired&#8221; by XDA guys. Right now i&#8217;m checking all the USA shopping services to get one. Price/features ratio seems to be a winner.</p>
<p>You do realize that only the launcher is locked to portrait right?</p>

<p>Also pretty sure that nearly any 3rd party launcher will correct this.</p>
<p>Oh, no i didnt! But what i loved is the Honeycomb extra buttons designed for tablets, made the device more &#8220;pc-like&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thank you Josh! Defiantly will pick one up!</p>
<blockquote>&#8230;is the fact that the homescreen doesn’t have a landscape view.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&#8230;and I can’t figure out why Google would have removed this functionality, which was present in Honeycomb.</blockquote>
<p>Well isn&#8217;t that because it runs the phone UI? Does it display all apps like it&#8217;s a phone too?</p>
<p>Seeing as how Chrome uses the Tablet UI, I&#8217;m guessing no.</p>
<p>Will the gps work on the Nexus 7 without an internet connection?</p>
<p>Yes, offline maps.</p>
<p>So if you take a phone, download a map, pull the sim card, the navigation features will still work?</p>
<p>Yes. GPS doesn&#8217;t require data, downloading the maps from the internet does, however.</p>
<p>I just ordered a Nexus 7 (I know, I probably should of checked into this first), but, I have a question that maybe someone who is more knowledgeable about Android than myself may be able to answer:</p>
<p>Does Netflix stream HD content to tablets? Specifically, the Nexus 7 if anyone knows. Or is everything SD? I have played with Android 4.0/ICS on a Motorola Xoom (Wi-Fi), and naturally YouTube can do HD streaming, however the Netflix app appears (at first glance, anyways) to only do SD.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yes, Netflix will do HD over wifi.</p>
<p>Should have. Should HAVE.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s in the box?</p>
<p>My biggest question is how will this compete with the Fire in terms of the content ecosystem (not apps, but books, periodicals, TV shows and movies).</p>
<p>It seems to me that Amazon has an enormous lead in that arena.  Yes, I know that the Kindle app will run on the Nexus just fine, but Amazon has done a few things to entice people to by into the Fire, by introducing free titles for Kindle owners.  Kindle app users on non-Kindle devices don&#8217;t have free access to this content, and the number of free titles (both in books and video-based content) looks pretty large.</p>
<p>Awesome video review Josh, Verge just knows how to do this, keep it up, thanks.</p>
<p>These Apple vs. Android debates are getting so damn old. I mean c&#8217;mon. If you wanna have a real debate, why not make a thread on one of the niche forums and have it there instead of vomiting all over the review of a product?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s silly because the Nexus 7 and iPad aren&#8217;t even comparable. People who wanna spend 500 bucks on a tablet will buy iPads. People who wanna spend 200 to 300 range will probably strongly consider buying the Nexus 7. They aren&#8217;t in any of the same categories to even consider the two &#8220;competitors&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it either.  I can understand some comparisons with the Fire, but then that doesn&#8217;t lend itself as easily to fanboy rage arguments since both are part of the same overarching ecosystem.</p>
<p>I own an iPad, and I&#8217;m seriously considering a Nexus, but I am also still looking seriously at the Fire, mostly due to the huge amount of content that Amazon offers compared to Google.</p>
<p>Thats no fun, this is more fun, I actually prefer debates here, I like reading through this.</p>
<p>Man all the arguing over iPad vs Android&#8230;.. Really people you are your own worst enemies. The only ones winning the arguments are the ones that are putting your money into their Bank Accounts.</p>
<p>Ford vs Chevy. Does it really matter which is better? That is the very reason I drive a Dodge. =)</p>
<p>Google specifically designed it as their content consumption device after analyzing what made Kindle Fire a success. Andy Rubin has said what Android tablets lacked was a &#8220;complete&#8221; media service. This meant Google trying hard to build up Google Play Store.</p>
<p>I am not sure if his analysis is complete. I think Kindle Fire&#8217;s success wasn&#8217;t just Amazon having good media portfolio. I think one of the key reason is &#8220;Amazon Prime&#8221;. A lot of people who already had Amazon Prime got the device. And who didn&#8217;t get to experience for a month to try out some free media contents.</p>
<p>Google Play doesn&#8217;t have that much of an existing users. Also, the Amazon Prime membership (and Xbox Live membership as well) may give you a smaller market than no membership (or free membership), but it gives the service a better set of loyal paying customers.</p>
<p>I think Google Play (at least the media side) will need some kind of a subscription/membership program (as well as expanding the content portfolio). This membership should allow some limited free contents.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I am not sure Google Play can catch up to other services, or eventually a continued success of Nexus media consumption device (Nexus Q included).</p>
<p>Great, well thought out post. My sediments exactly.</p>
<p>Google is too late, playing catch up from this far back will only make defeat worse.</p>
<p>Google Play doesn&#8217;t have many existing users?</p>
<p>Every Android user is an existing Google Play user&#8230;</p>
<p>Resisted a couple impulse buys of this yesterday. But since Josh says its good, ill be pre-ordering it shortly.</p>
<p>Google Play/Prime Partnership!</p>
<p>Im a googleholic, and even at $200 I still wouldn&#8217;t buy this. I rather spend the extra $200 &#8211; $300 for a complete tablet and just get the iPad 2.</p>
<p>Well, Windows 7 tablets are arguably more complete than even the iPad. They offer processors and gpu&#8217;s of a magnitude higher than anything in the iPad and Nexus7. They benefit from being able to use uncompromising software in a multi-tasking format that can both be equal and greater than what Apple and Google offer. I&#8217;m not messing with any of them, but I see the Win7 tablets as being more complete than what Android and iOS can offer. Between the iPad and this, I&#8217;d choose the Nexus. Simply because it&#8217;s good enough for the price point right now. In the future, I&#8217;d feel less bad about upgrading to something else considerably more powerful and capable.</p>
<p>Competition is good for the free market and especially go for inspired innovation. I would credit Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire for setting the value bar, while giving credit to Apple&#8217; s iPad line for raising the usable real world performance bar.</p>
<p>Vapors of windows surface ebb and flow gently as the Nvidia Asus Android Google mothership lowers the boom with tablet value domination that will sell in apple-esque quantities!</p>
<p>Woot Woot Nexus 7</p>
<p>as an ipad owner (1gen and 3gen) i can honestly say that the 7 inch tablet is where it&#8217;s at and i want one, and i think if people actually tested this out they would agree, but i know everyone likes bigger</p>
<p>I will wait for it to drop to $99</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how the whole process works, but hopefully content providers in all the entertainment industries allow Google to get music, movies, tv shows, etc. out to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>$200 is such a good price.</p>
<p>Thank you Amazon for setting that trend.</p>
<p>This is looking like quite a nice little device&#8230; not that I need anymore technology in my life, but I have never owned an Android device and this is the first thats really peaking my interest&#8230; if we hit some good specials come the holidays I may have to pick one of these up.</p>
<p>What an Apple fanboy.</p>
<p>Can we agree to shun any poster that calls a reviewer or another poster any kind of &#8220;fanboy&#8221;?</p>
<p>I would like that. This review alone should show how unbiased Josh is. He just loves good shit.</p>
<p>josh, that was the best reviews I&#8217;ve seen on this tablet. I think you gave it a fair score of 8.8 and your video was very detailed and to the point. keep up the good work.</p>
<p><em>"Duarte told me that the design was intentional, not a victim of cheap parts…"</em></p>
<p>Gosh, I&#8217;m shocked that a Product Manager would call out a feature as intentional rather than cheap.</p>
<p>Gr8 tablet for android, eager to buy soon :)<br />

<p>Its a game changer. All game changers should be given an automatic 9 IMO</p>
<p>Who needs 300,000 apps in the first place?<br />
I never understood this &#8220;Lack of apps&#8221; argument about Android.</p>
<p>I have about 20 apps on my iPhone I use somewhat regularly.</p>
<p>I just pre-ordered this Nexus 7 tablet and went window shopping in Google Play.<br />
Every single App I use in iOS has an Android version OR it`s equivalent.</p>
<p>Can you name a common/popular app iOS has that Android doesn&#8217;t have the same or an equivalent for?</p>
<blockquote>Who needs 300,000 apps in the first place?<br />
I never understood this "Lack of apps" argument about Android.</blockquote>
<p>Thank you!  Just an empty justification/argument.</p>
<p>I have about 100 apps on my iPhone and I use at least 40 daily.  See how my experience is different than yours? That is why the argument can and should be made.</p>

<p>Those apps all get used, and if isn&#8217;t one game, it is another (maybe tiny wings or doodle jump)</p>
<p>So why don&#8217;t you all just hush.</p>
<p>Haha you need to get off your tablet more and get a life if use 40 apps everyday. And padding the 40 list with super basic stuff like mail and safari doesn&#8217;t help to hide your fanboy ism at all.</p>
<p>i would have to force myself to get to 40 used apps in a day, lol</p>
<p>with that being said, android has more than 100 apps, so you are covered bro</p>
<p>Good/Great apps.  I have bought and sold 3 different android phones because I cannot accept the quality of their apps.  Sorry</p>
<p>I think the question there will be what you consider to be equivalent.  I could say a text editor is the &#8220;equivalent&#8221; of Pages or a sound board is the &#8220;equivalent&#8221; of Garageband.  Just about everything has some similar apps in the same category.  But are they extremely polished, high quality apps, or just something that sortof does the same thing?</p>
<p>This would be a bad table to have, but how does it help me work? Are there any Development IDE&#8217;s that support tablet mode? Are there any browsers besides Chrome that will give me an experience comparable to the desktop? It&#8217;s tough to even think of leaving the x86 world behind for something based upon ARM. I really wish the AMD or Intel would get more aggressive with their tablet offerings.</p>
<p>So what you&#8217;re saying is that tablets aren&#8217;t for you at all. And maybe, must maybe, the Windows 8 Surface might fill that void for you.</p>
<p>Yea, and I made a couple of really bad typo&#8217;s. It should read: &#8220;This wouldn&#8217;t be a bad tablet to have&#8221;</p>
<p>Surface is appealing in just the few known specs, but price (competitive with ultrabooks?) and the fact that the bootloader may be locked are issues. WinRT tablet&#8217;s have to use locked bootloader&#8217;s, but the higher end device actually running Windows 8 is a mystery. More than likely it will have a locked bootloader, but Microsoft hasn&#8217;t explicitly said so yet.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t put it past MS to lock it up tight since it&#8217;s their own hardware.</p>
<p>This looks great&#8230;love the expanded video component to the review as well</p>
<p>Nice Review Josh!</p>
<p>Lofty scoring but after watching the video review it makes perfect sense. In terms of net overall value to real world performance, this will raise the bar for every other android tablet.</p>
<p>I have played with several dozen android tablets, and they all felt half baked compared to the iPad, iPad 2 and iPad 3.</p>
<p>While the Kindle Fire was a great deal for its price, the antiquated software on the fire made it less appealing.</p>
<p>I have a long history of using asus mainboards in custom PC builds and they have been lovely! Sadly some of their latest boards seem to have DOA problems according to new egg reviews. Hopefully Asus&#8217;s tablet hardware returns to their history of quality construction.</p>
<p>I have to admit, this glowing review almost motivated my consumer side, but after that Cherrypal Asia disaster, I am hesitant to invest in any &#8220;price too good to be true&#8221; android hardware. That said, if this will work as a GPS to replace my garmin, I am going to drop by Best Buy and pick one up when they are available retail.</p>
<p>I wrote up a editorial posting on this subject on my blog FYI:</p>
<p><a href="http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html" target="_blank">http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html</a></p>
<p>By the way, can we get some reports on how stylus&#8217;s work with this tablet?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know myself. I was really hopig for it to be pressure sensitive, but since its not, I&#8217;d like to see how stylus performance ranks.</p>
<p>¡Yeah, I&#8217;d buy this to create some content using Sketchbook Mobile!</p>
<p>Am I the only who thinks that Google seriously needs Google Play giftcards? They want to promote themselves now as a content distributor &amp; not everyone has a credit card, especially those little tykes who might want this. That alone is a pretty major market.</p>
<p>Smart idea since I wouldn&#8217;t want my credit card linked to my kid&#8217;s Google Play account. Thankfully I don&#8217;t have any kids yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard too many horror stories from parents with kids that use their iPads.</p>
<p>Holy flame war, Batman.</p>
<p>Car analogies.</p>
<p>Steve McQueen Gloves on the 7, and MS has a kick stand that has a satisfying click as though a car door was closed. <br />
 <br />
At least Google didn&#8217;t make it match the leather from iCal.</p>
<p>nice review josh, i think you hit all the points of interest. as frugal as i find my spending habits,<br />
i almost want a &#8216;smaller&#8217; tablet to lug around and work with. i prefer the ~7 inch range over the<br />
larger ipad. makes me wonder how popular this form factor actually is to most people. from the<br />
looks of it i would already take this over the kindle fire without much hesitation. my only issue<br />
is that i already own a cheap pre-paid phone, an ipod touch, and and macbook pro. having to add<br />
a 4th or 5th gizmo to the old back-pack gets to be a little much, and i just want to condense my<br />
devices. after seeing this i&#8217;m also sketchy on how well microsoft can seriously compete with the<br />
surface in this market with apple and google, even if it can run full-blown desktop applications.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t you get an iPhone to replace the iTouch and the phone, and go with this and the MacBook Pro?</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re not that wedded to App Store content, you could have even more options for a phone replacement.</p>
<p>Good review, but I&#8217;m a little put off by the fact that ecosystem has taken a lesser role with the Google experience.  Windows Phone was ripped from one end to the other for not having the greatest selection of apps even though it comes on great heard in many cases.  What&#8217;s difference?  Why would I be better off with this table with damn near no &#8220;tablet&#8221; apps than I am with Windows phone which does have some apps and much more developer support (compared to the Android tablet developer pool)?   Just sayin&#8230;</p>
<p>Windows phone has more developer support than Android? What?</p>
<p>This tablet is capable of using both phone and tablet apps. The tablet apps will come now that ICS and JB are the focus of tablet OEMs.</p>
<p>Android has more tablet apps than WP has phone apps (yes they do). AND then all the non-optimized apps still work too.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of apps really need no optimization. Games for instance run perfectly fine on a 720p screen whether it&#8217;s 4&quot;or 7&quot; (or 10&quot;).</p>
<p>And then the non-optimized apps. Does it really matter that Skype (owned by MS) is not optimized for tablets? No of course it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Good review! It looks like a nice machine. I like the 7 inch size but I still prefer my iPad. The thing is, like many, I have invested too much in apps and features of the iPad that I can&#8217;t just switch. The iPad as been integrated into my way of life.<br />
Still I hope the Nexus 7 can grow into a strong competitor in this market.</p>
<p>Great tablet for the price. Might be supplementing my iPad soon. Too bad Android is a mess and the tablet apps on it are pure shite. Great for browsing the web and ereading though.</p>
<p>true true I feel the same&#8230; Migth be a &#8220;@ work media player&#8221;</p>
<p>With the popularity of this device, the apps will come. Just watch.  It&#8217;s a repeat of the Nexus One revolution all over again.</p>
<p>And while Android made be messy as a whole, on the Nexus lineup, it&#8217;s a great experience&#8230;.particularly on this device.</p>

<p>ah&#8230; i c</p>
<p>This is going to do for tablets what the Nexus One did for phones.</p>
<p>People who deride the Nexus One as a failure have never understood what it accomplished because they get distracted by the Google direct-to-consumer sales strategy flop.  Everybody forgets how weak the specs of most Android phones were at the time.  The Nexus One changed all that.  Google laid down a benchmark.  OEMs started making better devices.  Developers started coding apps on the Nexus One.  And Android took off.</p>
<p>In a year from now, lots of developers will be showing off Android tablet formats inside their apps or tablet exclusive apps.  And hardware OEMs are really going to step.  I fully expect that in 2013, we&#8217;ll see 8inch tablets with 1080p displays, 16GB of memory, quad core processors, etc. for $200.  And we&#8217;ll be able to thank the Nexus 7 for getting the ball rolling.</p>

<p>Ipad 3 review says hi! Or did you mean to say highest score for an Android product?</p>
<p>What sort of volume or deal has Asus got worked out to make their margins on this? If I recall correctly, the Fire was to be a loss leader at its price point and relatively lackluster hardware in order to get Amazon purchases. But they own the hardware and the pipe, so its OK. With the much greater specs and build quality evident in the review, I&#8217;m trying to figure out how Asus will make any money off this as a pure hardware play unless the bet is that they sell hundreds of millions of them&#8230; or they have some sort of content revenue sharing plan worked out with Google. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Asus makes thier money from Google buying thier hardware. Google is selling the tablet at the same price or very close to it that they are paying Asus to build it. Google is paying for all advertising. Therefore Asus takes very little risk wiht a potentially huge reward.</p>
<p>No forward camera?   Not an iPad killer then from the outset.</p>
<p>Your input means a lot just because of your username. I look forward to your future posts. Where can I subscribe to your newsletter?</p>
<p>Ipad Nano then.</p>
<p>The market is replete with Android tablets, but none have made a dent in iPad sales.</p>
<p>This tablet is bigger than a phone and some well developed phones rely upon the camera to, oh say, take a picture and update to Facebook et al.</p>
<p>In  tablet this large they could have incorporated a phone &#8211; okay they will in the next release I lay my money down.  As it is, the SN uptakers wont buy it.</p>
<p>With its size and price point, the Nexus 7 was never supposed to be a contender with the iPad. It&#8217;s also not meant to replace a phone. Instead, it is a pocket sized, multifunctional device that can be used to consume entertainment. Its competition is the Kindle Fire and the Nook Color, both of which are children&#8217;s toys compared to Nexus 7.</p>
<p>as an ipad owner, i think it will dent the ipad sales because plenty of people (especially these days) don&#8217;t want to spend $400+ on a tablet, plus the 7 inch tablet is the sweet spot in my opinion (after a couple of years with my ipad it could a slightly smaller, i know first world problems), they need to market it better though</p>
<p>The screen is half the size of the iPad. This was never a threat to iPad.. which, in case you hadn&#8217;t heard, has a Retina display.</p>
<p>yea i have the ipad 3, looks great (especially w/HD movies) but it really isn&#8217;t a game changer (unless you compare it to anything that is older than 3 years of course), again the way it&#8217;s going to compete with the ipad is it&#8217;s $200 pricepoint and 7 inch screen (which in my opinion feels better than the ipad)</p>
<p>the nexus 7 isn&#8217;t competing with the ipad3 in any way.</p>
<p>I really wanted to like this tablet, and with one important exception, I do. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this to come out since it was first rumored 3-4 months ago. BUT, the lack of a MicroSD slot is a deal-killer for me. 8 or 16 GB of storage is not nearly enough these days, and the price difference between the two models is insulting. 8 GB of flash costs practically nothing. I would happily pay $250 for 8GB built-in with a MicroSD slot. Hopefully, Asus will continue their original plan and ship the MeMo 370.</p>
<p>a lot of vegetarians here farting around</p>
<p>What gives? This review and many others quote WiFi on this tablet as being 802.11b/g/n but the Google Play Store (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb</a>) says 802.11a/b/g/n. Does it have 802.11a or not?</p>
<p>oh god, please let it be  802.11a. I just got the Asus Black Diamond dual band router and nothing to use on the 5Ghz band.</p>

<p>like Mildred said I&#8217;m surprised that any one can make $9183 in four weeks on the internet. have you seen this web link(Click on menu Home more information)     <a href="http://goo.gl/7XhkZ" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/7XhkZ</a></p>
<p>Mildred never said any such thing. LIAR!</p>
<p>Oh that&#8217;s cute.</p>
<p>Admittedly I am a WP7 user who loves my Ecosystem. Currently use a fire sale Touchpad with ICS . I do enjoy it. This makes me want this tablet although I will be getting a Surface upon release. Goodjob Googs</p>
<p>One thing I have to say about Google is that they are good at learning how to make their products fundamentally better. Maybe at the same level as Apple. Ever since the Fire came out, it was obvious to anyone with a brain that Google had to focus on the ecosystem in their tablets. And they did it. This deserves to be a success. Let&#8217;s see if it will become one.</p>
<p>a 7 for Eco System?</p>
<p>must be a joke&#8230;</p>
<p>dont get me wrong, i will probably buy one, but 7 for a tablet eco system that doesnt exist is shameful</p>
<p>Yep. I want one. And I have two iPads already. I&#8217;ve always been interested in Android, but never enough to justify spending the money. But for 200 bucks, I don&#8217;t have to do much justification. This looks like it&#8217;s exactly the Android device I&#8217;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>my thoughts exactly</p>
<p>This is the first Android device I actually can see myself buying. If it&#8217;s ever released in my region.</p>
<p>As expected from another device in the great Nexus series.</p>
<p>I love reading such well written reviews. Glad to hear the Nexus 7 impresses too, I&#8217;d much rather there be multiple great tablet options, rather than just one. I mean, I love my iPad 3, but I may want to try something different at some point lol.</p>
<p>The Asus Transformer Prime is pretty good or otherwise the Asus Transformer Infinity with HD screen.</p>
<p>Sure would like to watch the Video Review, but I am greeted by pink video artifacts obscuring everything.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s two in a row. Joshua Topolsky is now a certified Google fanboy :-)</p>
<p>Go read his iPad reviews and you&#8217;ll know he&#8217;s not :)</p>
<p>JT on Galaxy Nexus:<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the best smartphones ever made&#8230; and it could be the best ever &quot;</p>
<p>JT on Nexus 7:<br />
&#8220;This isn’t just an excellent tablet for $200, It’s an excellent tablet, period &quot;</p>
<p>Just sayin&#8230;:-)</p>
<p>Lol, true. Seriously though, read his iPad reviews and it&#8217;s like he&#8217;s watching the savior walk on water. Burning water even!</p>
<p>Yes, but he is not leading with his opinion of iPad. I know of institutions (not individual consumers) that want to buy iPad by the hundreds or thousands (seriously).   We all know of the iPad sucess story. However, to claim best in class or at least a solid contender in class, with little to no uptake by end users is a sure sign of a fan.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s that 40% (probably more) of apple consumers that don&#8217;t even look at other products, android will always be the underdog, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s worse, Josh doesn&#8217;t let that sway his opinion is all and i thank him for it</p>
<p>Can he not love both? I myself own both a Galaxy Nexus and an Iphone 4s. I love them both and they&#8217;re both excellent, but for different reason. And praising something that isn&#8217;t necessarily at the forefront of popular opinion isn&#8217;t fanboyism,. It&#8217;s appreciation of a product.</p>
<p>Android here I come!</p>
<p>I wonder if Google will advertise this device. If not then I doubt they will actually sell that many of these.</p>
<p>This tablet will definitely beat The Kindle Fire and Nook.  Blows em out of the water.  Props to Google for a good tablet.  But its not a iPad and no way compares to The New iPad.  Retina display all the way!</p>
<p>This obviously isn&#8217;t meant to compete with the iPad, and if you would use a little bit of deductive reasoning, you could have come up with that yourself. Instead, you chose the path of ignorance.</p>
<p>You android fanatics are funny.  Mean SOBs to the end lol</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how pointing out your obvious logical flaws is mean. I&#8217;m simply trying to help you be a better human being. Hundreds of millions of years of evolution gave you one of the most sophisticated tools to observe the world around you, and you choose to waste it away by spewing somebody else&#8217;s unoriginal garbage.</p>
<p>as someone who owns the new ipad w/retina display, meh it&#8217;s ok, not a game changer though</p>
<p>16GB version already pre-ordered, can&#8217;t wait until mid-July!</p>
<p>So has anyone heard anything about Nexus 7 supporting MHL or some sort of screen mirroring/ Video output? I talked to a Nexus Rep and he said that it supports it at the Hardware level but that is the only source I&#8217;ve heard that says It supports it.</p>
<p>MEH&#8230;it&#8217;s JUST another Andriod tablet.  FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Norway is VERY pissed about not having &#8220;Project Butter&#8221; in their Android 4.1&#8217;s&#8230; <br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub0GzU56YMA" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub0GzU56YMA</a></p>
<p>Okay one thing I think that should be corrected is that the tablet is *Designed and also Made by Asus.  I thought this was evident in the interviews that Asus/Google has had &#8211; they clearly pointed towards Asus developing it with Google giving feedback, not Google designing it.  Just want to say because we should give credit to Asus here, they seem have done well with the back side design, given the price.</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t find a list of the ports this thing has.  Does it have mini-USB?   Does it have a headphone jack?</p>
<p>How did you arrive at the 8.8 score when your totals add up to 62 which divided by 8 = 7.75? Just curious!</p>
<p>you can do this with all of their reviews, i don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s like this, i would kind of like an explanation my self</p>
<p>&#8220;[I]n most cases, the final score is an average of those subscores — yes, even down to the decimal point. However, since it is not a weighted average, the editor reserves the right to adjust the average to better reflect the overall assessment of the product, including how the price fits.&#8221;</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>well, the score chart is missing one major factor: price (or total cost, or value).</p>
<p>in this case the 7 would score a 10, since it clearly offers the most at its market price level. and that would bring the score up a full point to exactly 8.8.</p>
<p>If only it has 3G.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m what you might call an Apple fanboy, but I have no trouble calling this the best Android tablet so far and I predict it will also become the best selling Android tablet ever, dwarfing the sales of the Kindle Fire.<br />
Finally the hardware quality+OS user experience+price point comes together to make for an all-round appealing product. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how and if Apple will respond.</p>
<p>Best to ignore all the iSheep comments,,, they are cultists and have blinders on&#8230; some are now panicking..it&#8217;s funny and sad at the same time<br />
Nice to see Google going for a price point and decent product. I have an iPad 3 .. which after 3 months sits on the coffee table,,, thinking of buying an iPad Duster for it&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like your post is just from a reservoir of troll posts where you selected one, then copied and pasted it to the forum.</p>
<p>This tablet is performant, handsome and is useable with one hand. Plus, it&#8217;s affordable, what makes me crazy ..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kinda searching for a use-case to buy this tablet.<br />
Personally, I can&#8217;t find a situation in which I would like to use a tablet. Why?</p>
<p>At home; I don&#8217;t watch TV, I am in front of my notebook. And, I am also not reading books, shame on me.<br />
Outside; I am not using trains or busses. I use my car.</p>
<p>So, please tell me a use-case for this tablet, so I can buy it&#8230;</p>
<p>Are you serious? If this is just a shot at the Nexus 7 from an Apple fanboy, then I can&#8217;t convince you. Otherwise there are plenty of situations, for myself at least, where I could use this tablet.</p>
<p>First, if you read a lot and don&#8217;t like touching dirty library books where thousands of people touch them, you can save a ton of money with this. Download some kindle files and the kindle app and boom, free books that never rip or tear.(this doesn&#8217;t apply to you because you don&#8217;t read but if you ever start)</p>
<p>-  when you are at the mall waiting for your GF when she is trying on clothes.<br />
- when you are waiting for your car to be serviced and oil changes<br />
- when kids are getting a haircut<br />
- when waiting in your car for someone just pull it out if the glove box<br />
- when you want to lie down on bed but can&#8217;t leave your notebook and notebook is too heavy to lift over your head.</p>
<p>Trust me though, once you get a tablet, it is so much more convenient than the notebook it is crazy. I only use my laptop for excel, word, and photoshop know. Everything the tablet is just so much better. I currently use an iPad but this applies for any tablet.</p>
<p>yea, i remember when i got the 1st ipad i almost took it back because i kept telling myself &#8220;why did i get this, i don&#8217;t know what to use it for&#8221;, but eventually it was easy since i travel a lot, using my ipad on an airplane to watch movies second to none (especially if you have some sweet bose noise canceling headphones) and also when you are on the couce/bed it is the best medium for surfing the web and the like, whereas with your laptop you either have to turn your body or put it on your lap, not very comfortable, and your smartphone is way too small).</p>
<p>i have to admit you do have to force yourself to start using it and it&#8217;s features, but once you actually do you won&#8217;t want to go back</p>
<p>Great review !!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d buy this as it looks an excellent piece of kit, may even give my iPad 2 a well deserved rest.</p>
<p>Nexus 7 y u no video out?! :P otherwise looks pretty awesome for a cheap tablet.</p>
<p>the 7 is the first really good 7&quot; tablet from anyone, and the price has been set at the absolute no-profit minimum. so now the big question is, just how big a market is there for that &#8216;tweener size, period? we&#8217;ll find out this year &#8230;</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m reading this review, I&#8217;m not entirely sure if you were providing us with a review or if you were marketing this device to us. Just kidding. That being said&#8230; Thank you Josh. I&#8217;m sold! I&#8217;m actually gonna pre-order one right now. This is the tablet that I&#8217;ve always been waiting for. iOS is not for me and all the previous Android tablets have been such disappointments. But this! This one right here is the one. Thanks again Josh.   =)</p>
<p>I would be an extra $100 for hdmi out functionality. This hurts. I was so about to buy this too.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why people are so keen on having HDMI or any other video output on this device. Most phones these days have HML ports, and removable storage, so if you have a phone then you&#8217;re already set. If not, there are a variety of cheaper ways to get media from a device to a television. Most DVD or Bluray players have external USB ports that can read a wide variety of drives from external HDDs, to SSDs, thumb drives and even tablets and phones that act like plug and play drives. Then there&#8217;s always a Roku box, Google TV, Apple TV, Xbox 360, PS3, and even cheap media center computers, all with plenty of capabilities.</p>
<p>In essence, anywhere you go with a device, there should be one or more ways to display your media on a television without the need for a tablet with video output.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m far more likely to use video out on a device like this than my phone.  Usually the last thing I want is for my phone to be tethered to something when it needs to be able to receive calls, texts, notifications, etc.  Having video out would&#8217;ve been a nice feature.  It&#8217;s not a deal breaker for me especially not for $200, though.</p>
<p>I understand what you&#8217;re saying I really do.  And believe me I was considering trading my Nexus S in for a Galaxy Nexus. The problem is I would still want to use my phone when I&#8217;m watching TV (Sling player)  As it stands now, I have not seen an android device that is reasonably priced (Maybe the Prime) with TV out that can provide a high quality experience + tvout functionality. The issue with the prime I have been reading is that with the ICS update, there have been some issues with tvout.  None of those devices you&#8217;ve listed provides me slingplayer tvout ability. (Apple TV did at one point, but for local access, not remote access).  So that is my dilemma.</p>
<p>Also I already have a PC in my bedroom and I would like something more portable/multipurpose in my living room to use for the function.</p>
<p>Any word on when is this coming to international markets (Mexico, for instance)?</p>
<p>Think this is worth getting if you already have a  VZ Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>I have a VZW GN and I just got one.</p>
<p>Google/Apple/Microsft/Samsung without competition is a sad world that I hope never to see. Like with any corporations, they gain market share and play defense which means no innovations.</p>
<p>No microSD is a joke.</p>
<p>There are other alternatives to expandable storage.</p>
<p>It costs pennies to implement and there&#8217;s clearly space.</p>
<p>Tell that to the millions upon millions of iPad owners, Galaxy Nexus/S, HTC One owners.</p>
<p>What do you need microSD for nowadays? Everything is stored in the cloud? You can use microSD if you want slower read/write speeds.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t use the cloud on the go.   I thought this was obvious for a wifi only device.</p>
<p>Josh, did you seriously gave a &#8220;7&#8221; score to the ecosystem?<br />
Sorry, fantastic review in all, but this is a joke!</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;7&#8221; in battery life? Wait WUT?<br />
Reading the review, I would expect at least an &#8220;8&#8221; (if not 9) in battery life&#8230; and maybe a &#8220;6&#8221; score in ecosystem&#8230;</p>
<p>Be happy they didn&#8217;t give it a 6 like usually.</p>
<p>Yeah, the iPad has the best selection of apps and the most support. But I want a tablet and this one is half as much as the iPad 2 and $300 less than the new iPad, which it&#8217;s more comparable to as far as internals go. It&#8217;s just not worth an extra $2-300 for a few better apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few&#8221;&#8230; Yeah sure.</p>
<p>For most users, there&#8217;s almost no difference between the applications you can get for iOS and the ones you can get for Android. Yes, iOS has a lot more applications, but to be honest, do users need thousands of fart apps to choose from? Do they need thousands of the same types of puzzle games, or platformer knockoffs, or Atari-style tilt games? Do you really need over a hundred different Twitter clients, dozens of free digital leveling tools or compasses? No.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the average smartphone and tablet user frequently uses (3 or more times a week) less than 20 applications. They also only use a handful of applications on a daily basis. In other words, with iOS, you get a lot of crap to wade through so you can find something of quality, and in all likelihood it will be $1.99 for the phone version, and $4.99 for the tablet version (which has no added content, just more screen real estate).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of funny really. You pay more for an iPad so you can pay even more for applications for that iPad.</p>
<p>I disagree, there are some high quality apps for iOS that are not available for Android, many provided by Apple themselves (Google doesn&#8217;t seem to be writing the same types of client apps, perhaps it isn&#8217;t their core strength). Pages,  iPhoto, Garageband, Keynote are great, polished apps not available for Android. Sure there are apps that do the same general things, but that isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s being debated here- it&#8217;s apps that are as professionally designed and high quality.</p>
<p>I also think you&#8217;re also way behind the curve on universal apps for iOS.  I&#8217;d say wading through the crap is even harder on Android because it&#8217;s more difficult to even find an app in a given category that actually looks OK on a tablet sized display.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want a tablet and this one is half as much as the iPad 2 and $300 less than the new iPad&#8221;</p>
<p>WTF? Who thinks like this?!</p>
<p>Nice hardware, and Android is getting better. However, it is lacking in tablet specific apps. Google better watch their back because Microsoft is right behind you. So Google, pull your finger out.</p>
<p>I feel Google should have 3G variant as well(say $350) else all the talk of Google Now seems gimmick .. How would Google Notify me about the next train or delay in flight without Internet?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but my Android phone has a native WiFi hotspot toggle. For no additional cost to me, I can switch on my phone&#8217;s hotspot and use its data connection for any device I have handy. That makes a WiFi only version of any tablet much more appealing to me. I really feel sorry for people who use AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>My point was that it would be a complete package. Like I am generally using Iphone then I may not be able to always tether. Also for my work I cannot use my mobile battery to make WIFI hotspot as I have to use it for other purpose, it is costly affair for me. In Singapore 3G is better affair and we get extra sim for tablets for same data plan.</p>
<p>That would be nice to get an extra SIM card so we could use multiple devices on the same plan in America, I have to admit. I can see why you&#8217;d want 3G capability.</p>
<p>And also there is a use case &#8211; What if it is my first Smart device? Which I want to use for everything that phone does except calling and clicking pictures, I mean I am sure Google is well aware than what I am.</p>
<p>This would be a lot better with a cellular radio.  A lot of the features on this is useful for when you&#8217;re on the go.</p>
<p>Not only did they directly compete with their partners, but they are selling this at cost.  This is like MS giving away an internet browser back when everyone else was actually selling theirs for real money.</p>
<p>There is one tablet market, with a finite amount of dollars consumers have to spend in it. Every sale of one tablet not only takes away from sale of a competitor&#8217;s tablet…it also takes away a customer for the foreseeable future as the vast majority will likely never leave the competitors ecosystem .</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone attempting to claim they don’t care about a subset of that easily scaleable tablet market, are ignorant of reality (posters) or putting on a Public Relation stunt until they enter it under guise of not entering it (Apple, reduced price of ipad 2).</p>
<p>In addition, getting a foothold in 7&quot; is hugely important for when a 10&quot; nexus is released and when such 7&quot; users go to buy their next tablet.</p>
<p>Which leads to my next point in resposne to everyone who has posted it or is even thinking it… almost no one is likely to switch once they begin down the ios or Android path, as they become to heavily invested in hardware, software and accessories&#8230; so spare us of all the irrelevant statements implying the competitor’s os or hardware is just not good enough for you to switch. This is a fight for those new to the ecosystems-first time purchasers.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain to me the point of a tablet without 3G?Can anyone explain to me the point of a tablet that has no 3G and hence no</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t pay $50-$100 extra plus another contract and tether it thru your phone when you need access<br />
Isn&#8217;t too difficult to understand</p>
<p>The point is I have an iPad 3 with 3G and almost never use 3G. Maybe it&#8217;s special circumstances &#8211; I have a pre-paid 3G card and also an iPhone with tethering + 3G plan so I <strong>could</strong> tether. But I got the 3G because I thought that would be inconvenient. As it turns out, the vast majority of places I use my iPad have WiFi.</p>
<p>The other reason is, it&#8217;s $200.</p>
<p>I rarely/never use 3g for data on my phone.</p>
<p>I`m rarely/never anywhere without WiFi.</p>
<p>This tablet would work just fine for me.</p>
<p>Couple of things wrong with this review<br />
1. Trouble streaming to nexus Q<br />
Nexus Q stream from the play store, not the device we&#8217;re using right now. So if you have trouble with your internet connection in streaming HD content to nexus 7, of course it will happen to nexus Q who share the same connection<br />
2. Lack of tablet apps, twitter as example?<br />
This is twitter fault not updating their apps for tablet and it&#8217;s not a good example, as there&#8217;s other twitter apps that is optimise for tablet like plume and tweetcaster. Don&#8217;t judge the ecosystem just because few apps developer is lazy to update it for tablet. Especially facebook and twitter who view do not focus their effort of their apps on android. That&#8217;s why most of people use alternative social apps for facebook and tweeter.</p>
<p>There is a reason iOS has the most apps and most frequently updated too. Priority for iOS is always #1 and after that there&#8217;s not much money to create/update Android versions.</p>
<p>I heard iOS just got its millionth fart app. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Android has more &#8220;fart&#8221; apps.  Remember, there isn&#8217;t much of anything keeping an app out of the Android Market.  Which is why it&#8217;s so much easier for a developer to put a straight up piece of malware on it.   Apple hasn&#8217;t allowed generic &#8220;fart apps&#8221; for a while.</p>
<p>The fact that you even bring up malware shows just how ignorant you are.</p>
<p>The fact that you call someone ignorant after making a troll post about a &#8220;millionth fart app&#8221; shows how ignorant <em>you</em> are.</p>
<p>honestly, not many people care about twitter and facebook official apps. Facebook official apps is slow as turtle. Most of us is just better off using the altenatives. Friendcaster (that has been optimize for 4.0), tweetcomb (twitter app for tablet), tweetcaster, tweetdeck, twicca etc. There&#8217;s ton of alternative.</p>
<p>Mostly I am thrilled that Google has finally realized what a laggy POS Android is, and is doing something about it.</p>
<p>If you own an iPhone and play around with any Android phone in the mall, the one thing that immediately stands out, like in the first 3 seconds of using the device, is how animations are kind of stuttering. Pre-iOS that may have been acceptable. Post-iOS, it certainly isn&#8217;t. It stands out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>So now they have Duarte, and apparently some people from a gaming background to fix the FPS. Even if it&#8217;s not perfect in Android 4.1, it will be soon thereafter. <strong>That</strong> is the exciting takeaway for me. Android will be a competitor. I&#8217;ll be able to look at Android phones and seriously consider them as an alternative.</p>
<p>I know &#8212; forget functionality and whatnot &#8212; <em>how smoothly does your home screen scroll</em>? That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s important here. If your homescreens don&#8217;t scroll smoothly, you&#8217;re just holding trash in your hand.</p>
<p>Second most important &#8212; how pretty do your icons look?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much useful functionality you put into a piece of consumer electronics; if it&#8217;s awkward and uncomfortable to use, people will look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Pre-iOS feature phones were actually more functional than the first iPhone, but they were almost without exception a nightmare to use.</p>
<p>Kudos to Google for realising that they&#8217;re selling primarily to consumers, where this stuff is at least as important as functionality.</p>
<p>yah because the ui smoothness or lack there of, is only on the homescreen!</p>
<p>can anyone tell me if a camera is supported via the USB OTG on the Nexus 7?  it would be great to use as a microscope or for some augmented reality apps.  I know keyboards and mice have been tried.</p>
<p>I have an ipad 2, that&#8217;s great for most things, but only OK for Text; I also have a Kindle Keyboard (no light); should I buy this Nexus 7, maybe for reading books at night, for the gps?  Can I stream movies from my PC to it?  I need your opinion&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t talk about the Nexus 7, but for me, going from iPad1 to iPad3 has made an enormous difference. I read loads of PDFs and the higher ppi makes that a much, much better experience.</p>
<p>There are multiple video apps that can stream from PC in multiple file formats including mkv and avi.</p>
<p>I liked the 7&quot; form factor for reading books on the couch, but not in bed &#8212; I found it fatiguing holding it in one hand while lying down since there&#8217;s no lap to brace it on. I use my GS2 for bedtime reading.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used my 7&quot; Galaxy Tab since I bought the Asus Transformer Prime. But the GTab only has 1024 X 600 resolution. The Nexus 7 has the same resolution as my Transformer Prime, so I&#8217;m curious as to which one I&#8217;d prefer after long term use.</p>
<p>For reading at night, I&#8217;d suggest the Kindle lighted cover.  It&#8217;s not perfect &#8211; there&#8217;s a brightness gradient from the top-right to bottom-left &#8211; but I still find it far easier on the eyes than a backlit LCD.</p>
<p><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/02/kindle/shasta/covers/images/cover_lighted_handheld._V186791130_.jpg" /></p>
<p>Ok, please someone correct me, I really think this could not be. If you sum all numbers and divide by 8, you don&#8217;t get 8.8, you get 7.8</p>
<p>(8+8+6+8+9+9+7+7) / 8</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%288%2B8%2B6%2B8%2B9%2B9%2B7%2B7%29+%2F+8" target="_blank">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%288%2B8%2B6%2B8%2B9%2B9%2B7%2B7%29+%2F+8</a></p>
<p>well do you really think a camera score should be as equally weighted as performance in a tablet? probably not.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 is the best Android tablet, I&#8217;m just talking about the score, its the sum of all score divided by 8</p>

<p>How many times are people going to make a comment like this before they realize there are rules, you can even find them at the end of the article!</p>
<p>My fault, I read the rules just now. <br />
It says: &#8220;the are no rules, we just give points based on our secret though.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was, a bigger surprise for me.</p>
<p>Why is there a &#8220;Camera(s)&#8221; score category on tablets? Is that just to justify giving it a lower score? You already do that every every android device ever made in the &#8220;Ecosystem&#8221; category. In the article it even says shame on you if you use a tablet to take pictures, but you still include a low camera score&#8230; Well, that shouldn&#8217;t surprise me.</p>
<p>Agreed &#8230; a camera is always a secondary thought on a tablet.</p>
<p>The math wrong. It not 8.8, its 7.8 (8+8+6+8+9+9+7+7) / 8</p>

<p>It&#8217;s helpful if you do your research before you post. They can give a product any score they want to.</p>
<p>The grammar wrong.</p>
<p>You know when you see that an article has &gt;1000 comments that there&#8217;s a big Apple Vs something\everything else war going on&#8230;</p>
<p>I think it would be a rarity for any comments on a tech news site not to degrade into Apple versus Google drivel, no matter the amount of posts nor the content of the article.</p>
<p>I really love the 7&quot; form factor. I was an Asus Transformer TF101 since launch and i have only used 4gb out of the 16gb that i have available. It&#8217;s a great tablet but I think I&#8217;d prefer a smaller, faster, and prettier tablet. I&#8217;m going to either sell it or trade it in for the N7.</p>
<p>Best Android app for streaming from my NAS?? Someone please recommend!!!</p>
<p>Dice Player Free can do it all and is the best media player I&#8217;ve used, but with one caveat &#8212; it holds your network password in clear text if you have folder security enabled.</p>
<p>ES File Explorer and MX Player. Map your NAS shares as a LAN server in ES File Explorer. Simple and works amazingly well on a local network.</p>
<p>So how exactly is this better/different than Sammy&#8217;s 7incher?  That&#8217;s a sweet piece of kit also.  As a KF user I&#8217;m really leaning towards a larger form factor next go-around, don&#8217;t like the shape of crApples pad, maybe wait for the Surface to come out.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t even a tablet.  It&#8217;s a big phone or an lcd ereader.</p>
<p>Using this wildly intelligent reasoning, EVERY tablet is just a big phone or lcd ereader.</p>
<p>The best feature of this tablet, stock android without any 3rd party skin or stupid manufacture apps. You also sure to get quick OS updates in this device.</p>
<p>Reminds me of another&#8230;. nah,,.. forget it&#8230; crazy talk</p>
<p>I have to say I&#8217;m surprised by this tablet as well and I think I would probably agree with this review on the whole (if I had one to play with) and believe me coming from an Apple o Microsoft fan and a genuine Anti-Android voice, Jellybean seems to be the first of the OS where they&#8217;ve started putting some of themselves into the OS&#8217; features. For me it still doesn&#8217;t address the main issue enough: Security.</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t vet any of its apps unlike MS and Apple, making each of them a potential piece of malware. I know you can stick to the bigger, more trusted names, but what about up and coming genuine studios and app developers that then can&#8217;t be trusted because they&#8217;re not as well known. If they sort out issues like these (and please don&#8217;t say that there is android anti-malware software out there, because you shouldn&#8217;t require anti-malware on a mobile platform)  and they innovate some of their own original ideas into the OS and stop simply (trying to) improve other peoples ideas, I will feel comfortable recommending the OS &#8211; given that the issues Joshua has raised such as the flailing tablet app market for android are addressed also.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, a dodgy looking piece of software is usually dodgy. This isn&#8217;t exclusive to Android or mobile phones or anything. If something both looks too good to be true, and seems dodgy, it probably is.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get why so many seem to whine over no HDMI and no microSD slot? It&#8217;s a $200 tablet for crying out loud and to complain is spec snobbery true to form. Google won&#8217;t placate to a spec snob&#8217;s desire to be a digital hoarder you know (sounds like an inevitable spin off of A&amp;E&#8217;s Hoarders, eh?). There&#8217;s no logical reason why someone would require a tablet to be capable of keeping an exhaustive local library of every jam, flick, pic and PDF he or she has ever come across. It&#8217;s looney, impractical and blatantly ignorant of the ginormous <em>cloud</em> that hangs over head.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a question for the spec snob: Since when did a tablet become the primary media center? As far as I know, it hasn&#8217;t, and it never will be. At most, it&#8217;s for watching short clips and occasionally a movie perhaps when you&#8217;re on a plane, train or bus. I know I like to watch &#8220;my stories&#8221; comfortably on a legit TV screen where it makes sense. If I need to get real work done, I have a pretty slick laptop in arms&#8217; reach (I&#8217;m sure not going to edit a PowerPoint on a 7-inch tablet through some hacky Polaris Office app).</p>
<p>I read once somewhere tablets are pretty much a sofa companion. Show of hands: anyone agree (my hand is up by the way)? It&#8217;s my Roku remote when I can&#8217;t find my actual Roku remote, it&#8217;s what I use to look up Shark Tank contestants in mid-episode so I can learn right then if they&#8217;re still kicking, and it&#8217;s much more to me. But to say I&#8217;m enjoying my tablet and not criticizing the very medium that doesn&#8217;t meet some asinine criteria would be an absolute true statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to enjoy what smarter people than us have created, dearest spec snob. Google Play, Spotify, Amazon and others have a cutesy, cartoony clouds for you to wiggle your stubby fingers through. Go on, try it! Feels good, right? Let them worry about your storage &#8212; don&#8217;t live in fear of &#8220;what if&#8221; scenarios for not getting to your goods. We have reliable vendors and reliable connections and eventually one or the other will go down, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world, and it&#8217;s time to make peace with the fact that nothing&#8217;s perfect &#8212; not even the tablet.</p>
<p>I have more thoughts on the spec snob via Technorati. <a href="http://technorati.com/technology/android/article/plight-of-the-spec-snob-why/" target="new">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>A pompous post about snobs? Also, completely specious post. Your expectations and needs do not extend through the rest of the world, no matter what your mama told you.</p>
<p>Renting movies and firing them out through a TV is handier on a tablet than a dirty old laptop.</p>
<p>Finally a computer voice that doesn&#8217;t sound like Stephen Hawking! What took them so long?</p>
<p>Better question yet, why hasn&#8217;t anyone updated Stephen Hawkings voice emulator?? He is only one of the greatest minds of the last century&#8230;.. Apple/ Google get on it!</p>
<p>I just purchased mine &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>To anyone that has 1 I would like to know what the web browsing experience is like because I know that is what I will be using it for the most. Just curious to know how well it loads heavy pages, how well does it load the Verge?</p>
<p>ok.. i&#8217;ve searched online several times but can&#8217;t find any info on live wallpaper support for the nexus 7.. can someone please provide any insight? does it have live wallpaper support and if so anyone care to share what the jellybean live wallpapers look like?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2012/07/03/jelly-bean-live-wallpaper-brings-a-taste-of-android-4-1-to-all-devices/">JB Live Wallpaper.</a></p>
<p>Since it was announced at Google I/O I&#8217;ve been looking at the ordering page and just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it&#8230;. until an hour ago!</p>
<p>I love Google, but I really hate how it doesn&#8217;t serve Play Store in my country (Singapore)!</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t those soft buttons eventually burn into the screen? I used to think LCD&#8217;s can&#8217;t get burn in but after reading my new TV&#8217;s manual, I guess its possible?</p>
<p>LCDs can&#8217;t get &#8220;burn in&#8221; by definition. What people refer to as &#8220;burn in&#8221; on LCD screens is when the pixels cannot return to their &#8220;relaxed&#8221; state. It&#8217;s present in every type of electronic device to some degree.</p>
<p>However, the screens on most devices are static enough that if burn in happened  frequently, you would hear about it all the time. It is very rare for an LCD screen to experience this problem before the screen itself just dies.</p>
<p>This is one of those devices that I really want but don&#8217;t &#8220;need&#8221;. Normally I throw the word &#8220;need&#8221; around a lot but in this instance I think I might keep it in reserve because I already own a Nexus mobile device (Nexus S), and at this point I really don&#8217;t feel like I need a bigger more powerful version of my phone. Although I must say, if I had cash to splurge with I&#8217;d pick one of these up. It&#8217;s gorgeous!</p>
<p>All Amazon needs to do is come out with an upgaded Kindle Fire 2 device and they keep the lead again just based on content ecosystem.  It is becoming a very competitive tablet landscape for sure.   I am not sure the iPad is not a lesser device now compared to this new Google Nexus.  I still prefer the Microsoft Surface Pro to this without a doubt though.  The Kindle Fire, Nexus 7 and to some extent the iPad are toys compared to the Surface.</p>
<p>you prefer an unreleased product with no price or specs?  instead of two real tangible products one of which is the market leader and has a much better eco system?</p>
<p>you&#8217;re probably the same guy that &#8220;preferred&#8221; the zune when it was announced too.</p>
<p>Too bad I just got myself a Kindle Fire.</p>
<p>I seriously can&#8217;t wait to get one of these. This review has definitely made my decision for getting seem like an even better choice.</p>
<p>I will be getting a surface I think</p>
<p>Does Nexus 7 support any kind of video out? Most importantly does it support tv-out via 3.5mm﻿ jack like Galaxy S or Nokia N95 etc, can you check with a 3.5mm-to-rca cable plz?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really like tablets, to me are useless, I really prefer to wait the Microsoft Surface pro. But what I really like that android will screw apple xD.  (Sorry for my english)</p>
<p>guess you&#8217;ll be disappointed then because in no way will this tablet &#8220;screw&#8221; apple.</p>
<p>Who wants to buy my kindle fire?</p>
<p>How does the Verge come up with the final score?  Based on the breakdown, it got a couple of 9&#8217;s, three 8&#8217;s, and the rest are 7&#8217;s and 6&#8217;s, so how is the final score an 8.8?  Is it a weighted average?  IMO, that&#8217;s a pretty high score for a tablet that, while provides very good value in terms of price/performance, doesn&#8217;t bring anything new to the table in terms of design, materials or cutting edge features.  And while Google did a nice job with JB, they still haven&#8217;t addressed the apps issue.  Unless they can get devs to get on board with tablet optimized apps, what&#8217;s the incentive for smartphone owners to spend $200 to run the same apps on a screen that&#8217;s only a couple of inches bigger than their phones?</p>
<p>Cause its  not a big deal to scale up on a 7 inch device and keep a nice resolution? Blame the devs not google. They have access to the tools needed</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand.. this is a week-old story at this point. Why is it still listed under &#8220;breaking&#8221; at the top of the page?</p>
<p>not sure if anyone else has come across this yet (very relevant for buyers in the uk); google has failed to strike deals with television networks &amp; magazine publishers <em>which is also the main reason why amazon abandoned their plans for a worldwide launch of its kindle fire.</em><br />

<p>anyways, i&#8217;ve already pre-ordered mine and will also be getting one for my dad :)</p>
<p>10:27 &#8230; awesome bug on the table!</p>
<p>UBM Techinsights have done their teardown and are mentioning a resistive screen?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ubmtechinsights.com/google-nexus-7-teardown/" target="_blank">http://www.ubmtechinsights.com/google-nexus-7-teardown/</a></p>
<p>ELAN Microelectronics eKTF3624BWS – Controller for Resistive Touchscreen<br />
ELAN Microelectronics eKTH1036BWS – Controller for the Resistive Touchscreen</p>
<p>What is going on? Is this not a capacitative screen? The specs don&#8217;t actually say.</p>
<p>Might be a typo on their side, or some misunderstanding. Basically, resistive screens are soft (since you need to press the upper layer down to make contact with the lower one, to register touch) and allow no multi-touch. The Nexus 7&#8217;s screen is definitely capacitative.</p>
<p>Oh Jushua, shut up about the &#8220;no tablet apps&#8221; for pets sake!   There isn&#8217;t supposed to be! There is supposed to be ONE app which adapts (not that hard under Android) The Apple idea of having different apps is just a greed move to get people to pay more than once.</p>
<p>I think the point here is indeed that most apps currently don&#8217;t adapt/scale properly, because there was no effort to have an interface suited to larger screens. Twitter&#8217;s a good example.</p>
<p>Actually, I think the question of phone apps vs tablet apps is interesting. It&#8217;s accepted that general software may need to be bought twice to run on different platforms because of the extra dev involved. With the seemingly unified OSs of iOS and Android, there&#8217;s now one platform but markedly different screen sizes. That didn&#8217;t exist before, besides for websites (but you don&#8217;t pay for these).</p>
<p>So with these new OSs, it would appear the bulk of the work is on the interface, not on the bolts and gears. Does it justify paying twice for the app? Hardly, I would say. A mid-way solution could be to charge only an extra for the other version, once the first one&#8217;s been bought, to recognise this work.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s still the question of what you actually download to your device. Its screen size won&#8217;t change, so you may want to optimise, e.g. by not downloading the super high-res data on your phone. That&#8217;s what we do with mobile websites. Yes, I&#8217;m thinking iPhone/iPad here, with the app size blowup due to the new display. Blurring the line on Android with all screen ratios and sizes from 4&quot; all the way to 13&quot; doesn&#8217;t help either. But then this means there still isn&#8217;t one unique app, but several versions of it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve read about it by now, but if you want to read another review by an IO attendee, look no further: <a href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/07/03/nexus-7-review/">Nexus 7 Review</a></p>
<p>after watching this review, not sure what to get now. The iphone 5 or a phone with droid jelly bean?</p>
<p>Watch these Android vs. iOS videos, and you&#8217;ll see why you should get a phone with Jelly Bean. Maybe wait for the next Nexus phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMiY1kSTHZw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMiY1kSTHZw</a></p>
<p>Well considering &#8216;droid&#8217; branded phones only exist at verizon, you wont be able to get any with jellybean for the forseeable future. Droid=certain android powered devices from verizon. Android=operating system. Nexus=google branded devices running vanilla versions of their android software</p>
<p>Droid devices have always had a sparkle. Especially into the tablet sector. My first droid was a smartphone&#8230;I remember, my good old HTC Wildfire. I was quite enchanted when I bought it, but well, in time I thought of changing it into something more fun and powerful. So, I thought of a tablet. Now, I was first tempted to purchase a Kindle Fire, because let&#8217;s say I am quite passionate about reading and investing into my cultural backgrounds and the price Amazon came up with was really really good ( price/ quality truly acceptable). I am reconsidering the deal after this review. I am thrilled what I&#8217;ve heard so far about Jelly Bean and the design is refined and more subtle than Kindle&#8217;s wrapping. I might take this into consideration! Thanks for this article! :)</p>
<p>We have had several Nexus 7&#8217;s now &#8211; all replacements for defective units &#8211; huge screen issues &#8211; see this small selection of YouTubes for the various types of screen problems -</p>

<p>Google might have wanted to establish some Quality Control SOPs with Asus &#8211;  before releasing this half-baked tablet on to the market</p>
<p>One mistake which a lot of people do is to compare the number of &#8216;tablet optimized&#8217; apps for iPad and Android tabs.</p>
<p>With a 7 inch tablet this problem is by far not as big as many would believe.</p>
<p>Most phone apps work fine on the nexus 7 AND the fact that android fits the phone app much better to the 7 inch size make the &#8216;problem&#8217; even less important.</p>
<p>Example: try a iphone app on an iPad, the results are horrible. If you scale the picture it&#8217;s extremely fuzzy, if not then you have a tiny window in the middle of the ipad screen. Both ways are terrible.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t happen with android, as the app is automatically fit to the whole tablet screen without scaling low res graphics. This might result in smaller font size sometimes but overall the result is leaps and bounds better than iPhone apps on an iPad&#8230;</p>
<p>Chrome for Android is also present as the stock browser on the Nexus 7, and it performs excellently on the device.  Yeah its great if you don&#8217;t want to watch videos on the verge, Engadget and many others. it says it doesn&#8217;t have flash installed but it works fine on iOS witch doesn&#8217;t have flash. so much for free and open.</p>
<p>Picked up one of these two days ago. It showed up in two days and is an excellent device. Play store works great and the integration with all your google accounts is flawless.</p>
<p>Very nice tablet. I luv Android :)</p>
<p>Thanks for the review.</p>

<p>Buying this tablet for Php 15.7k (around $379) tomorrow here in the PH grey market. It &#8217;s selling so well in the US i doubt it will available in our country anytime soon. :(</p>
<p>I have a Nexus 7 and i HIGHLY recommend it.<br />
Here are some nice tips for Nexus 7<br />
Lets your Nexus 7 play movies on any screen via HTC&#8217;s Media Link HD (hands</p>

<p>Very balanced review, with all the details that are needed. I think the Nexus 7 is finally the much needed step Android had to take in order to get a foot into the tablet market. All other Android tablets up to now just didn&#8217;t get any relevant market share.</p>
<p>Some of my Nexus 7 impressions can be found here:</p>

<p>I was excited about the Nexus until I read there was no SD card. It made me want to root a Nook Tablet.</p>
<p>the best tablet i tried so far, incredible fast, perfect size, jelly bean the best OS, happy as hell with the nexus 7</p>
<p>Who cares who invented &#8220;pinch to zoom&#8221;? Lawyers maybe, thats it.</p>
<p>Well yeah.</p>
<p>I think the point is that Samsung can appeal and put more emphasis on this distinction and get 915 overturned easily, no?</p>
<p>I think the point is that Samsung DID infringe on the above patent, but they can workaround it like Google have done with JellyBean.</p>
<p>I wonder why Samsung didn&#8217;t just use Google&#8217;s code, since Android has had pinch-and-zoom since about Android 2.1 or so</p>
<p>Everybody wonders why Samsung did not just use Google&#8217;s code.  Google&#8217;s code is usually better.</p>
<p>Samsung sucks at software&#8230;</p>
<p>Samsung sucks PERIOD.</p>
<p>They tend to make pretty solid hardware, though their software is generally pretty crap, which is a common theme among most hardware makers. With a few exceptions of course.</p>
<p>For the same reason that they don&#8217;t just use stock Android for everything &#8211; Samsung (mistakenly) believes that it can do a better job of developing Android than Google, its creator.</p>
<p>It also thinks that its crappy skins will help to differentiate its product on the market, which it certainly does &#8211; the minute I see TouchWiz on a phone, I know I&#8217;m not going to buy it, no matter how much ladies love the &#8217;Wiz.</p>
<p>The carriers also like/encourage the modifications. Before the iPhone was available on Verizon, they tried to get the next best thing &#8211; an Android phone made to look like the iPhone (i.e., the Samsung Fascinate). They probably then used the Fascinate as a bargaining chip to get more favorable terms in their deal with Apple for the CDMA iPhone 4 (which came to Verizon just half a year after the Fascinate).</p>
<p>And yet, Android fans and consumers flock to Galaxy phones&#8230; orders of magnitude more than Nexus phones.  Yeah, doesn&#8217;t make sense to me either.  Sheep mentality at work, perhaps?</p>
<p>Yup. After getting the SGS and SGS 2 I realized what garbage they are and got a Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus and Nexus S &#8211; no SD Card<br />
Galaxy Nexus and Nexus S &#8211; bad Camera<br />
Without much thought I came up with two reasons why people would go with Samsung&#8217;s own devices instead of the Nexus ones.<br />
As far as I understood it Google themselves only changed that behavior to no longer infringe with Jelly Bean. So it would not have helped Samsung to stick with Google Code. I don&#8217;t like TouchWiz either by the way.</p>
<p>Also the first think I did with SGS2 was root and install a custom rom based on google stock.</p>
<p>Well it would have helped them because Apple would have had to sue Google.</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus has 32GB of admittedly fixed storage. With Play Music and Google&#8217;s other cloud offerings, who needs swappable storage?</p>
<p>Anyone who lives somewhere that Play Music and Google&#8217;s other cloud offerings aren&#8217;t available?  Like anywhere other than the United States?</p>
<p><strong>Grumble, grumble</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of places in the US that don&#8217;t have acceptable signal, like almost anywhere outside of a big city and more than 20 miles from a coastline.</p>
<p>Anyone who works in a basement, or works in a mostly metal building.  One of my clients has a verizon cell tower on their property, as soon as you get more then 20 feet into the building, you have 0 signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;android fans&#8221; dont use stock UI</p>
<p>I think their earlier Android stuff looking an awful lot like Apple stuff may have helped them gain some level of popularity.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s probably because of the massive advertising push that each Galaxy phone gets. The vast majority of consumers are severely uninformed and will buy whatever a TV ad tells them to.</p>
<p>Because Apple never do that do they<br />
<img src="http://asset2.cbsistatic.com/cnwk.1d/i/ne/p/2004/101204u2_applead.jpg" /><br />
<img src="http://appyshka.com/img-uploads/fe22958ac9475f6b0737000030db43ab2119926932.jpg" /><br />

<img src="http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/50XeWNnsPLM/mqdefault.jpg" /></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s he great carrier deals they offer when you walk in the shops.</p>
<p>The patent itself is about how it detects the fingers themselves. This is driver territory. When the driver decrypts the signal from the screen then android performs the pinch to zoom. At least that is my understanding of it.</p>
<p>Because they love copying Apple, even though there are easier ways of doing things.</p>
<p>You mean the ruling not the patent itself I assume?</p>
<p>Of course their lawyers are too incompetent to raise these points and had to wait for a web blog to do the work for them. Pathetic.</p>
<p>No, it appears they did infringe the Apple patent. The incompetence is not in the lawyers, it&#8217;s in the designers not simply designing around the patent in the first place.</p>
<p>Listen to yourself. Designers should spend their time reading patents, just so that when they come up with an idea which happens to be in one they can do it differently?</p>
<p>Well&#8230; that&#8217;s what the patent system is for&#8230; to protect a certain way of doing something.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t research patents and end up doing something the same way as someone else&#8230; you will get sued.</p>
<p>They can appeal, but probably will not get away with it.</p>
<p>I think one thing the jury should have ruled not infringing was pinch to zoom and perhaps the patent office should have been careful with awarding the patents. Or it should be FRAND by now.</p>
<p>Nilay&#8217;s point is that <strong>most</strong> people, the jury included, didn&#8217;t understand the patent.</p>
<p>Velvin Hogan did apparently, and that was enough.</p>
<p>Keyword: <em>apparently</em></p>
<p>The jury saw slides walking them through every element of each claim Apple asserted, point, by point, with examples. Then Samsung got to show prior art and demonstrate how its devices were different. They may not have understood in the end, but they had a lot of help to get there.</p>
<p>Most of us only got limited snippets of media coverage from the trial, but my perception of this coverage is that Samsung&#8217;s legal team, in many areas, failed to explain critical details to the jury &#8211; at least in a way that the jury would understand.</p>
<p>Again, reasons why &#8220;laymen/laywomen&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t be on a patent trial jury. If you can&#8217;t understand the damn patent, you aren&#8217;t qualified to deem it infringing.</p>
<p>It appears there were technical people on the jury, the head juror was an engineer with his own patent (speaking from memory, please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.)</p>
<p>I disagree. Patent issues can be complex but that is why you have expert witnesses to make it clear. Remember this is a <strong>civil case</strong>. Apple has as much to lose as Samsung to bringing a case like this to a jury of laypersons.</p>
<p>Then Hogan instructed his fellow jurors that the prior art didn&#8217;t apply since it was on a different hardware architecture (based on the bloomberg interview).  Is there any legal validity to this logic?</p>
<p>Of course prior art was neglected. Hogan himself holds patents for how video is handled on mobile devices for which prior art certainly exists.</p>
<p>Seems like Samsung&#8217;s legal blew this during jury selection.  He had no business being on the jury and seems to have had a major impact on the result.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>You guys know nothing more than what the media have reported, haven&#8217;t the dangers of that JUST been highlighted by Nilay!? Maybe Samsung were happy with the jury because they knew more than you or the media do.</p>
<blockquote>Maybe Samsung were happy with the jury because they knew more than you or the media do.</blockquote>
<p>Or maybe they didn&#8217;t, seeing as you too, know nothing more than what the media has reported&#8230;</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s not claiming magic insight without evidence. You guys are.</p>
<p>I fail to see the harm. This is a comments section on a tech blog, after all. We aren&#8217;t the &#8220;media elites&#8221; here.</p>
<p>Speak for yourself</p>
<p>I know exactly what the jury foreman said in his interview which can be seen here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/apple-jury-foreman-here-s-how-we-reached-a-verdict-RqtqHC25QbOBFg7xrWa5Wg.html" target="_blank">http://www.bloomberg.com/video/apple-jury-foreman-here-s-how-we-reached-a-verdict-RqtqHC25QbOBFg7xrWa5Wg.html</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite hard to imagine that in retrospect Samsung&#8217;s legal team is happy he was on the jury.</p>
<p>Exactly. If Apple&#8217;s patent claims are either upheld or invalidated I would wish it was based on sound legal reasoning.</p>
<p>Based on that interview, I highly question that happened.</p>
<p>Two day old news. Thanx!</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t seen it or heard about this. <br />
You are not the only living entity on this planet sir. Thanks!</p>
<p>Key words- in retrospect.</p>
<p>Jury selection is something both sides spent a lot of time and money on (this I know). While it is possible there was a strategic mistake (you get a certain amount of strikes, etc., and this could have been &#8220;the next juror&#8221; or &#8220;the least bad of the alternatives&#8221;), it is also possible that Samsung wanted him for a reason, and got their research wrong. Humans are funny like that.</p>
<p>In retrospect, everything is easy to analyze.</p>
<p>Hindsight is rough, and a bitch!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.spaceg.com/multimedia/collection/motorcycles/Harley-Davidson/biker%20dog%202.jpg" /></p>
<p>More up to date and accurate interview by the same guy:</p>
<p>He owns an Android phone, too:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19425052" target="new"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19425052" target="new">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19425052</a></p>
<p>So you&#8217;re saying that whatever Samsung thought about him being in the jury was not a mistake? Really? Samsung must be so happy about that decision then, our fault</p>
<blockquote>You guys know nothing more than what the media have reported</blockquote>
<p>Well when the &#8216;media report&#8217; is an interview with the JURY FOREMAN it is pretty relevant.</p>
<p>Seriously?  He had no business being on the jury?  Based on what logic?  Because he owns patents and that would make him biased in favor of Apple?  Yet, Samsung sued Apple for infringing on its mobile patents, so that wouldn&#8217;t be a logical reason.</p>
<p>Perhaps Samsung lost because every person not blinded by hate or fanboyism saw that Samsung copied Apple?  Heck, a roomful of blind jurors would&#8217;ve been able to &#8220;see&#8221; that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m shocked to see that some people are actually surprised by the verdict.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m sure people know Samsung and Apple could object to people. If he was on the jury it&#8217;s because Samsung didn&#8217;t object.</p>
<p>So, on one hand we have people saying the jury should have comprised of experts who know how the system works, and on the other (sometimes the same people) we have people who are against someone who DOES know about how the system works being on the jury?</p>
<p>Make your mind up people.</p>
<p>So does that &#8220;prior art&#8221; also void Google/Motorola&#8217;s latest claim against Apple, specifically:-</p>
<p>U.S. Patent No. 5,922,047 on an &#8220;apparatus, method and system for multimedia control and communication&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8217;047 Patent generally relates to communications and control systems for multimedia. In particular, the &#8217;047 Patent discloses, inter alia, an apparatus and method for providing control functions over multiple and diverse media applications, preferably operating at more than one designated node or location.&#8221;</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>No lawyer but I do think the hardware can matter in some cases.</p>
<p>Except if you bother to watch the Bloomberg interview that&#8217;s not what he said or what happened. They went through all of the claims of the patents comparing them to the claimed prior art. Only if the prior art met ALL claims did they consider it to be valid, and non of those cited did (they were mostly pretty lame).</p>
<p>This is the key point that people are forgetting. Just because you went &#8220;oh wow&#8221; when you played with pinch to zoom for the first time doesn&#8217;t mean that apple innovated that concept. Popularizing a concept and innovating a concept are two COMPLETELY different things!</p>
<p>As Facebook has so famously proven.</p>
<p>With all the multi-touch prior-art including the famous video shown off at TED, some 10 months before Apple even applied for the patent, I&#8217;m surprised Apple&#8217;s patent wasn&#8217;t invalidated, I don&#8217;t know whether that comes down to Apple&#8217;s lawyers not being great, being too rushed or that Apple&#8217;s use of pinch to zoom is so specific that it&#8217;s so easily worked around anyway.</p>
<p>The jurors were specifically shown the Han demo from TED.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/15/3244580/jeff-hans-multitouch-demo-apple-samsung-trial-patent-validity" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/15/3244580/jeff-hans-multitouch-demo-apple-samsung-trial-patent-validity</a></p>
<p>how the invalidation due to prior art work? is as simple as &#8220;hey, this looks similar to something that is already done&#8221; or is it more like &#8220;if we look at the details of how things are implemented there are differences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, I think I read somewhere that Apple&#8217;s patents were restricted to implementing the gesture on a capacitive touch panel. The Jeff Han demo used IR sensors, IIRC. Lame? Yes, but maybe legally significant.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a myth too. Look at the elements of claim 8 up there — no capacitive screen needed.</p>
<p>So then it&#8217;s definitely invalidated. The TED talk shows prior art, no?</p>
<p>Prior art needs to be introduced X time before the patent filing to be valid. I think 12 months in the US, so no dice.</p>
<p>Half true, it&#8217;s anytime before invention OR one year prior to filing so it should still be good. Besides, the foreman said that they upheld the patent because of the differences in processor architecture, link in my comment below.  <a href="http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/matters/matters-9106.html">Source that explains prior art</a></p>
<p>What a dummy. He probably had some vague idea of how this may have worked for the computer industry in the 80s and just applied it to a tech industry that he has no understanding of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSXkJBKT1s" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waSXkJBKT1s</a></p>
<p>Fast forward to 2:22: Pinch to zoom as demonstrated by Sony back in 2001; six years before Apple applied for the &#8217;915 patent.</p>
<p>1988 example:<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/dmmxVA5xhuo?t=4m29s" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/dmmxVA5xhuo?t=4m29s</a></p>
<blockquote>So then it’s definitely invalidated.</blockquote>
<p>That couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth at this point in time. A jury has just returned a finding of &#8216;not invalidated&#8217;.</p>
<p>The difference between de facto and de jure. It&#8217;s definitely invalid, but legally it&#8217;s been held up as valid.</p>
<p>Thank Mr Hogan&#8217;s flawed reasoning for that.</p>
<p>According to your version of events&#8230;</p>
<p>According to <em>whose</em> version of events? Hogan said it wasn&#8217;t invalid because iOS can&#8217;t run on those old multi-touch boards. Apparently he doesn&#8217;t follow technology enough to know that iOS only runs on Apple devices period, despite having a patent himself.</p>
<p>No &#8211; he didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So you didn&#8217;t watch the interview with him.  Okay.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what he&#8217;s saying, and the fact that he&#8217;s explicitly talking about the freaking <strong>460</strong> patent means that the patent that he was talking about is a samsung patent.</p>
<p>Yeah I know what you&#8217;re talking about. He mentions they were discussing the Samsung 460 patent just prior. But he specifically talks about the APPLE and prior art software not being interchangeable when he is describing it does not invalidate the claims.</p>
<p>That could easily mean that he realized that 460 was both not invalidated (by the prior at) and not infringed ( by apple) for the same reason.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that neither of us really know what he meant, so claiming that what he said somehow morally invalidates the verdict is ludicrous.</p>
<p>Fact is whose ever patents he was talking about not being invalidated by prior art, his reasoning for coming to that conclusion if flat out WRONG.</p>
<p>As a result the jury did not spend the time considering any of the prior art presented during the trial.</p>
<p>Again &#8211; you&#8217;re assuming you know exactly what he meant rather than trying to simplify what he actually did for an interviewer and a TV audience. At any rate it really doesn&#8217;t matter, because nothing that he said has any bearing on this legally.</p>
<p>So you can choose to go the rest of your life believing that some terrible miscarriage of justice has taken place and there&#8217;s nothing that anybody can do to stop that.</p>
<p>Yes, because with Cloudgazer, truth doesn&#8217;t matter, only legality. What is right is overridden by what is legal.</p>
<p>Well to be fair, in the case of a trial, what is legal is typically what matters.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if legal battles were settled by what people think is &#8220;right&#8221;? Definitions of right and wrong tend to be circumstantial. We have the law because we need some way to judge behavior in an objective way. Not saying it&#8217;s always perfect, but I&#8217;ll take a jury judging a case based on set laws rather than their biased beliefs of right and wrong.</p>
<p>Just look at some of the responses about this case&#8230;what&#8217;s right tends to stem from what OS people use, not an objective guideline such as the law.</p>
<p>No, Cloudgazer can stop him!</p>
<p>Yes he did. His whole reason for invalidating prior art was that the existing software for that prior art couldn&#8217;t run current OS&#8217;s and current ideas, which is a pile of steaming horse excrement and definitely something Samsung will use in their inevitable appeals.</p>
<p>They could easily claim a mistrial with that interview, as his reasoning and therefore the jury decision, as it had to be unanimous, was flawed.</p>
<p>*existing hardware</p>
<p>As has been explained ad nauseam, nothing he has said has given Samsung any grounds to claim a mistrial.</p>
<p>Your whole reason for believing that the jury&#8217;s decision was flawed is &#8211; legally speaking &#8211; a pile of steaming horse excrement.</p>
<p>No. He didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And there were another 8 jurors who also found that Samsung had not proven the patent invalid.</p>
<p>Who were all convinced by Hogan that he had the right idea.</p>
<p>According to your creative retelling of events.</p>
<p>What we actually <strong>know</strong> is that the jury unanimously and individually found that Samsung had not proven the patent invalid.</p>
<ul>
	<li>They were all in the court room.</li>
	<li>They were all presented with all the arguments and evidence.</li>
	<li>They all returned &#8220;No&#8221; to the question of &#8220;Has Samsung proven by clear and convincing evidence that Apple&#8217;s asserted utility and/or design patents are invalid?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is how law works. It&#8217;s a system that has served us very well for hundreds of years. If the jury were not convinced by Samsung&#8217;s lawyers, you have nothing to complain about but Samsung&#8217;s lawyers.</p>
<p>And we know based on the jury foreman&#8217;s interview with Bloomberg that the reason for not invaliding the patents based on the prior art submitted at trail was based on some very questionable ideas of jury foreman.</p>
<p>If Apple&#8217;s patents are either upheld or invalidated I just want it to be based on sound reasoning, not the misinformed reasoning of a confused juror who was able to convince the rest of the jury.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And we know based on the jury foreman’s interview with Bloomberg that the reason for not invaliding the patents based on the prior art submitted at trail was based on some very questionable ideas of jury foreman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don&#8217;t even know with any certainty which patent he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230;  His reasoning for not invaliding based on prior art is wrong regardless of whose patents we are talking about.</p>
<p>If you want to be like that then it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; his reasoning is irrelevant to the legitimacy of the ruling at this point.</p>
<p>Just so we&#8217;re clear, that is how the legal system works, but that does not always perfectly line up with <em>reality</em><strong></strong>, please don&#8217;t confuse the two.  Just because a jury decides a case one way does not make it the correct view.</p>
<p>That is incredibly bad logic in the form of:</p>
<p>Well, the jury decided oj was not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of killing his wife so it must not be so!</p>
<p>really bad logic.  Never suggest it again please.</p>
<p>As I said, there&#8217;s no way to convince the googletariat at this point that there wasn&#8217;t some terrible miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>They would believe that whatever the jury say, do, or have put up as sky-writing.</p>
<p><strong>This is how law works. It’s a system that has served us very well for hundreds of years. </strong></p>
<p>You might want to tell that to people who are wrongly convicted by juries &amp; sit on death row. This system you are glorifying is far from infallible. This case proves it.</p>
<p>Unless this result is right, in which case it says nothing about how well the system works.</p>
<p>And nothing was said about infallible &#8211; it was &#8220;served us very well&#8221; &#8211; so comparing wrong convictions to correct ones, and ignoring wrong non-convictions, do you know the statistics that say the system isn&#8217;t working well?</p>
<p>Fanboy much?</p>
<p>And this case &#8211; <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-08-13/us/us_michigan-facebook-new-trial_1_bond-decision-facebook-post-raymond-and-thomas-highers" target="_blank">http://articles.cnn.com/2012-08-13/us/us_michigan-facebook-new-trial_1_bond-decision-facebook-post-raymond-and-thomas-highers</a></p>
<p>The jury decision had to be unanimous. One juror fucking up his understanding is enough to claim a mistrial at appeal.</p>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t. If the jury gave a unanimous verdict without outside interference then Samsung have a rather high standard to meet in order to get the verdict overturned: they have to show that &#8220;no reasonable jury&#8221; would have come up with the answer they did, and these interviews have no weight in proving that.</p>
<blockquote>legally it’s been held up as valid</blockquote>
<p>So it&#8217;s currently valid both in practice and by law? That makes it de facto <strong>and</strong> de  jure surely.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not valid in practice, or everyone wouldn&#8217;t already be using it.</p>
<p>Yeah but according to the foreman since they run on different processor architecture the prior art doesn&#8217;t apply. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/apple-jury-foreman-here-s-how-we-reached-a-verdict-RqtqHC25QbOBFg7xrWa5Wg.html">From his own words go to 3 mins in</a> He says he convinced the other jurors of this. If that&#8217;s so can Samsung have them reevaluated since the foreman misinformed the jurors?</p>
<p>Yes, and then no media is following up on this.</p>
<p>Juror introduces his own incorrect arguments into deliberations and convinces jury to disregard prior art testimony resulting in 1 billion dollar verdict&#8230;</p>
<p>seems like a story big enough to report about???</p>
<p>The patents cover both the very specific gestures and the APIs that tie them to the OS&#8217;s response actions. The Han demo from TED didn&#8217;t necessarily cover the specific gesture details described in the patent and definitely not the APIs tying the gestures to OS actions. That could be what the juror was referring to.</p>
<p>I would love to believe something like this were the case, but based on Mr. Hogan&#8217;s own words from the Bloomberg interview this doesn&#8217;t appear to be the case.</p>
<p>I could accept that when reviewing the specifics of the prior art the jury found a difference in the implementation. But as Hogan describes it if the dimondtouch software can&#8217;t run on an iphone&#8230;. that somehow &#8220;changes everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>I also find it very ironic he actually says it &#8220;changes everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Erm &#8211; you&#8217;re talking about what he&#8217;s saying at 3 minutes in? That&#8217;s about a SAMSUNG patent. &#8211; the &#8217;460 patent.</p>
<p>The amount of time it would take you to find the part of him saying this would be shorter than making this comment about it not being at that exact time.</p>
<p>No &#8211; he&#8217;s clearly talking about the 3min mark, and that&#8217;s nothing to do with invalidating an Apple patent.</p>
<p>Watched the clip. You&#8217;re an idiot. At that exact moment he describes the realization the led him to falsely believe that Apple&#8217;s patents were infringed upon.</p>
<p>No &#8211; he&#8217;s talking about the &#8217;460 patent, he says it very clearly. The 460 patent is a samsung patent.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s confused, he talks about the &#8216;460 but then talks about it being Apple&#8217;s and why the prior art isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>He talks about how his &#8220;epiphany&#8217;s&#8221; (ie his own made up interpretation of the law) helped him breeze through the complex issues. The 460 patent is just an example.</p>
<p>If your issue is that he incorrectly upheld Samsung&#8217;s patents then I don&#8217;t really see what that has to do with Apple&#8217;s patent.</p>
<p>No, you seem to be (deliberately) misunderstanding what the guy said. he&#8217;s talking about all prior art debates.</p>
<p>In fact he probably invalidated Samsung&#8217;s patent for the same reason that he invalidated prior art. It&#8217;s not running on the same processor.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense, but then that&#8217;s the whole point. The guy is a loon.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t invalidate any of Samsung&#8217;s patents.</p>
<p>Jezus. You know what I mean, he deamed the patent &#8220;not violated&#8221;.</p>
<p>Um &#8211; no I don&#8217;t know what you mean &#8211; I only know what you say.</p>
<p>There seem to be a lot of people on this thread who believe that they know what people mean when those people say something completely different &#8211; I am not one of them.</p>
<p>We were talking about how Samsung&#8217;s patents weren&#8217;t upheld in the trial and I incorrectly call that &#8220;invalidated&#8221;. You seriously cannot make that &#8220;leap&#8221;? No trigger saying &#8220;ok this makes no sense at all and it wasn&#8217;t what we were talking about anyway&#8221;?</p>
<p>Ah well. It&#8217;s pointless anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m supposed to know this the same way I&#8217;m supposed to know (according to others) that when he talks about the &#8216;460 patent he doesn&#8217;t actually mean the &#8217;460 patent?</p>
<p>Let me put it another way, you just misspoke in a way that you apparently feel embarrased by and which perhaps made you look a fool.  Is it not possible that he also misspoke in a way that made him look a fool?</p>
<p>People are reading an incredible amount into a short and somewhat confusing interview.</p>
<p>With invalidate I meant in that trial. ie not uphold.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just tiresome when people are so intent on reading the dumbest interpretation of something when it&#8217;s not relevant at all if it was &#8220;invalidated&#8221; or &#8220;dismissed&#8221; or whatever.</p>
<p>He does not just talk about &#8217;460.  He talks about how he applied his epiphany to prior art in the same way as to 460.</p>
<p>He oversimplified everything to the ridiculous.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t he also the one who claimed they just needed to look for a bezel to establish trade dress breach?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He oversimplified everything to the ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly the android commentariat have done that when it comes to this trial.</p>
<p>The Apple fans haven&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Who cares anyway, that&#8217;s what fans do. It&#8217;s not like either of these groups just based a billion dollar fine on this behavior.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&#8217;ll see in a few months/years what happened when the challenging and the appeals are all done.</p>
<p>Either what Nilay says is true and this patent is not broken by Android (it uses panning and not scrolling), or the Han demo and/or others before it is prior art.</p>
<p>A court with regular dealings in patent appeal cases would know how to deal with prior art over different hardware.</p>
<p>The Han demo is problematic because of the timing.  The jury could reasonably discount it if they felt that Apple had conceived of their invention before it.  If it had been prior to Jan 2006 then it would be purely down to whether or not it practiced the claim &#8211; but that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p>Apple would need to prove they invented it before the demo though (both the jan 2006 one and the feb 2006 one). Also it should not be before  jan 2006.</p>
<p>Otherwise the demo was before the invention moment or they waited too long after the invention.</p>
<p>Seriously though, Apple employees attended the Han demo and will then claim to have invented the exact same things themselves just before that demo?</p>
<p>Apple would need documentation demonstrating conception before Feb-06,</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no requirement on it being after Jan-06 &#8211; prior art before Jan-06 would introduce a statutory bar, but not conception prior to Jan-06. (pages 44 &amp; 45 of the <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1307378/1901_revisedfinaljuryinstructions.pdf">instructions</a> )</p>
<p>So he either mispoke when he said &#8220;Apple software&#8221; or he misspoke when he said the patent number he was mentioning. Or he was talking about two different things.</p>
<p>None of us can say what he really meant. It seems more likely for someone to get a patent number incorrect than the name of the company he was talking about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the one trying to use what he spoke as evidence for some terrible miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>If you believe that his speech isn&#8217;t reliable then you should be arguing with those who are.</p>
<blockquote>In fact he probably invalidated Samsung’s patent for the same reason&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>Just out of curiosity&#8230; have you actually been following this trial <strong>at all?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s cheating to know the facts!</p>
<p>Fuck off. It&#8217;s a typo. Christs sake</p>
<blockquote>Fuck off. It’s a typo. Christs sake</blockquote>
<p>So you meant to say &#8220;In fact he probably <strong>validated</strong> Samsung’s patent for the same reason…&#8221;?</p>
<p>Cloudgazer ribbed me already for it. No need to jump on the bandwagon.</p>
<p>Just get back to recommending comments of your fellow trolls.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not at all possible that the foreman misspoke or was misunderstood?</p>
<p>Technically he talks about the &#8217;460 before it but then says that when he thought about putting the APPLE software on the prior art, it was not interchangeable. And he said that that &#8220;changed everything&#8221;. He also said it was HIS realization.</p>
<p>He specifically mentions Apple software and how the prior art did not apply to Apple software because of the different processor architectures.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter what went on in the jury room.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_v._United_States" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_v._United_States</a></p>
<p><em>&#8217; The court noted that &#8220;the near-universal and firmly established common-law rule in the United States flatly prohibited the admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict.&#8221;&#8217;</em></p>
<p>Even if the Foreman did misinform the jury (and there&#8217;s no evidence that he did) it wouldn&#8217;t help Samsung in the least.</p>
<p>The common law rule is not the Federal (or California) rule. There are still prohibitions on what jurors can discuss, but the quotation from Wikipedia is not the last word on whether or not the jury foreman&#8217;s actions were proper, because Federal Rules of Evidence (606 B 2 b) do allow testimony about whether  &#8220;an outside influence was improperly brought to bear &#8230;,&#8221; and it is possible that the foreman&#8217;s use of his knowledge of patents would be considered &#8220;outside influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jury foreman is on the jury &#8211; by definition he&#8217;s not an outside influence.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;An evidentiary hearing, including juror testimony on drug and alcohol use, was not required under petitioners&#8217; Sixth Amendment right to trial by a competent and unimpaired jury. <strong>That right is adequately protected by several aspects of the trial process, including voir dire, </strong>the fact that the preverdict conduct of jurors is observable by the court, by counsel, by court personnel, and by other jurors, and by the fact that, as here, the trial court may allow a post-trial evidentiary hearing to impeach the verdict by nonjuror evidence of juror misconduct.&#8217;<br />
</em></p>
<p>How does that not apply in this case?</p>
<p><a href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/483/107/case.html" target="_blank">http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/483/107/case.html</a></p>
<p>Tanner was about FRE 606.</p>
<p>This is the rule. Outside influences are things like bribery, extortion- classic jury tampering. It can also, on occasion, include other things (such as improper information brought to the jury from outside the jury). Do you know what it doesn&#8217;t include? People on the jury talking to each other.</p>
<blockquote>it is possible that the foreman’s use of his knowledge of patents would be considered "outside influence."</blockquote>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>What kind of reasoning is that?</p>
<p>3 minutes in he&#8217;s talking about Apple attempting to invalidate a Samsung patent.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>Wow &#8211; insightful argument!  You must do well in debate soc!</p>
<p>OMG dude, you are daft.  You would have been perfect on that jury.</p>
<p>OMG dude, you are daft. You would have been perfect for samsung on that jury.</p>
<p>So hes saying its OK to steal something, as long as its on a different processor architecture?</p>
<p>Hello intel based androids?</p>
<p>But it does say that the touchscreen needs to be integrated:<br />
&#8220;a touch-sensitive display that is integrated with the data processing system&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess one could argue if a front or back projector is &#8220;integrated&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the device was like the old Microsoft Surface table, all components in the same box, then it&#8217;s integrated. If they are separate boxes connected together then it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking about the Han demo and DiamondTouch demo.</p>
<p>And then Mr. Hogan convinced the rest of the jury to disregard the prior art. Not based on any of the testimony presented at trial or arguments presented by Apple&#8217;s attorneys under cross examination, but based on his own incorrect assertion that because the software from the prior art could not be ran on an iphone that is was somehow not relevant.</p>
<p>I would love to see some more in depth reporting on THIS!</p>
<p>Hopefully Nilay will come back on this.</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems kind of important&#8230;</p>
<p>Jury foreman goes on TV and drops a WTF moment on everyone when he explains his &#8220;ah-ha moment&#8221; that he used to convince the jury to stop deliberating on prior art.</p>
<p>Maybe we could get a software patent expert to chime in on the validity of Hogan&#8217;s claim that since the prior art&#8217;s software can&#8217;t be ran on an iPhone that it demonstration of similar behaviors isn&#8217;t evidence to invalidate a patents claims.</p>
<p>See Cloudgazer&#8217;s post above. It looks like there might not be any play on this info.</p>
<p>What?!? So samsung won&#8217;t be successful in appealing based on legitimate interpretation of the law because the jury made a ludicrous claim? Samsung can still push for prior art, because it was prior art despite what the idiots in the jury thought.</p>
<p>Only if there are contradictions on the face of the verdict.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the verdict, how this jury decided is irrelevant. You can now substitute them out for the bestest jury ever, and if that jury could have come up with the decision, then it stands. (Note- there are plenty of other grounds to appeal, but I think Samsung&#8217;s chances for anything other than a few nominal victories are slim to none).</p>

<p>In depth reporting on your creative re-imagining of events?</p>
<p>Uh&#8230; <strong>That&#8217;s. Not. How. It. Works.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d characterize it as a follow up on some very interesting comments made by Mr Hogan during his Bloomberg interview, but you go ahead and think of it however you wish.</p>
<p>I have a slightly biased view on this, but anyone with anything close to a level head has to be slightly taken aback by what he himself said was the reasoning he used to convince the rest of the jury that prior art should NOT be considered as invaliding Apple&#8217;s patent claims.</p>
<blockquote>I’d characterize it as a follow up on some very interesting comments made by Mr Hogan during his Bloomberg interview,</blockquote>
<p>Comments that you&#8217;ve deliberately expanded and reinterpreted into a remarkably large number of unsupported claims:</p>
<ul>
	<li>And then Mr. Hogan convinced the rest of the jury to disregard the prior art.</li>
	<li>Not based on any of the testimony presented at trial or arguments presented by Apple’s attorneys under cross examination, but</li>
	<li>based on his own incorrect assertion that because the software from the prior art could not be ran on an iphone that</li>
	<li>is was somehow not relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s how his words are reported by a journalist who takes them at face value, instead of creatively expanding them and reinterpreting them as you have done:<br />
<blockquote>A key breakthrough came after the first day, he said, when at home he began pondering the role of &#8220;prior art&#8221; – pre-existing examples of ideas – in invalidating patents. Hogan, himself a patent holder, began considering Samsung&#8217;s claimed &#8216;460 patent, covering the use of email in a camera phone, which it was asserting against Apple.</blockquote><blockquote>He realised, he says, that Apple and Samsung&#8217;s implementations were not interchangeable, meaning Apple had not infringed (The jury eventually determined that Apple had not infringed any of the five patents asserted by Samsung in the trial). When he explained that to the jury at the start of the second day, it led to a breakthrough in their understanding, Hogan said.</blockquote><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/28/apple-samsung-foreman-explains?newsfeed=true" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/28/apple-samsung-foreman-explains?newsfeed=true</a></p>
<p>Now&#8230; you realise Charles Arthur and you are both reporting from the same source? Do you see how different they are? Which one is an accurate reflection of the facts (as known), and which is something else altogether?</p>
<p>Yes&#8230; I read that article as well, it is actually the only one goes into any further depth.  But it is not as descriptive as the Bloomberg interview where he explains what he means by &#8220;not interchangeable&#8221;  as not being able to run the software on the other&#8217;s hardware and vise versa, which makes no sense whether you&#8217;re talking about invaliding based on prior art or establishing infringement.</p>
<p>In the Bloomberg interview he specifically says that reasoning was used when considering &#8220;prior art&#8221; and Apple&#8217;s patent claims. The guardian article characterizes it differently.  I&#8217;m more swayed by the direct source from Hogan&#8217;s own mouth.  There are however inconsistencies between his interview and the article.</p>
<p>Or he&#8217;s talking about the 460 patent &#8211; just like he said &#8211; where Samsung specified dedicated buttons, which Apple didn&#8217;t have and so it wasn&#8217;t interchangable.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;sequentially displaying other images stored in a memory through the use of scroll keys;&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>You couldn&#8217;t do that on an iPhone, because it has no scroll-keys &#8211; it truly isn&#8217;t interchangable.  As the verge said ..</p>
<p><em>Samsung is invoking the doctrine of equivalents to establish that this gesturing feature is substantially the same as the claimed scroll keys. The jury will have to decide if they believe that.</em></p>
<p>He literally says the words &#8220;I realized that the software on the Apple side could not be placed into the processor on the prior art, and vice versa, and that changed everything right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes he mentions 460 before that, but he mentions &#8220;apple software&#8221; and his incorrect logic in the same sentence.</p>
<p>He literally says &#8216;the 460 patent&#8217;  your point?</p>
<p>My point is that either one of the things he said was wrong, or he changed subjects between sentences. Why are you so convinced that he misspoke when he said &#8220;Apple&#8221; and not when he said &#8220;460&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not attempting to claim that there has been some tremendous miscarriage of justice &#8211; based on some sloppy speech of an excited former juryman.</p>
<p>That article does conveniently leave out the fact that he invokes the differences in processor architectures as a reason for the prior art to not count, which is by all accounts completely false.</p>
<p>Exactly. I would just be interested in seeing some some follow up reporting on exactly what Mr. Hogan meant by that statement. In the interview he said it was a turning point in the deliberations so must be important in understanding the verdict.</p>
<p>Nobody here has any idea exactly what happened in the jury room. Therefore, you have no reason to defend YOUR version of what happened while calling someone else&#8217;s a &#8220;creative re-imagining&#8221;</p>
<p>How is it a re-imagining when we are all imagining what really happened?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m reading into things a bit but based on Hogan&#8217;s crazy statement until someone does some follow up reporting I feel its a bit justified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please tell me that&#8217;s not why all the prior art was ignored&#8221; is how I feel after watching his interview.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly how I interpreted what he said in the bloomberg interview, what do you think he meant?</p>
<p>Because, as the article just noted, the TED video is not prior art because you don&#8217;t understand what the patent actually is.</p>
<p>actually the TED video is not prior art because Mr. Hogan convinced the rest of the jury that is was applicable to the patent claims because the software running on the prior art hardware couldn&#8217;t be ran on Apple hardware and vise versa.</p>
<p><strong>was not applicable</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to post-edit, how about &#8220;couldn’t be ran on&#8221;?</p>
<p>Nilay, doesnt the last bullet point in your quoted text from the patent indicate &#8220;pinch-to-zoom&#8221;. I repeat the text here (note the word &#8220;scaling&#8221;):<br />
&#8220;responding to at least one gesture call, if issued, by scaling the view associated with the event object based on receiving the two or more input points in the form of the user input.&#8221;</p>
<p>That could be referencing two finger, single-tap to zoom out.</p>
<p>The real point is the Jury was from San Jose, CA, USA where Apple is always right and a FOREIGN ASIAN firm must be a copy cat. Unfortunately for Apple in the next round they will have a judge to deal with.</p>
<p>Hmm, Lucy Koh &#8211; yes, she must really hate Koreans!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what kiddo is saying you nitwit, but both of your comments are racist and dumb.</p>
<p>And she&#8217;s not going to gratuitiously overrule the jury (or she&#8217;ll simply be overruled in turn by CAFC), neither has she proven terribly happy with Samsung or their lawyers.</p>
<p>So are you saying that being walked through the elements of each claim led them to incorrectly judge outside of what the patents actually say, or that they judged correctly?</p>
<p>I have to wonder if all the armchair attorneys that post in these threads drive you nuts, or if you are just numb to it at this point?</p>
<p>I know I get a little crazy every time I see someone on the internet giving medical advice they read on Yahoo Answers.</p>
<p>I think the did understand and their assertion is correct.</p>
<p>That is always the difficulty when you have a basically layman jury when it is about technical issues such as patents and patent implementation for software.</p>
<p>Then apparently Samsung didn&#8217;t do a good job explaining it. That&#8217;s on them, not the jury.</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s why lawyers make the big money?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he was making the point at all that the jury didn&#8217;t understand the patent.</p>
<p>He links to an article in which Samsung <strong>failed</strong> to show that they did not infringe upon Claim 8 of the Apple patent. He also says that Android designed around the patent in Jelly Bean, but does not say that Samsung did not infringe with those 21 out of 24 devices.</p>
<blockquote> the patent office should have been careful with awarding the patents. Or it should be FRAND by now.</blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t look like you understand why/how patents become subject to FRAND.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>There is no standards organization on user interface accept for maybe some standardized keyboard shortcuts by the WAI-ARIA standard from W3C for accessibility.  Because Apple never sought adoption of a standard for their patents then FRAND is out of the question.  That&#8217;s just not how FRAND works.  Apple wanted the nano-SIM standard to be as they proposed.  If Apple held patents pertaining to nano-SIM they would have had to offer them up as FRAND.  As it was, Apple offered FREE licenses to any patent they owned that may pertain to nano-SIM to refute claims that they were pushing their nano-SIM patent to get patent royalties.  Apple&#8217;s purpose for pushing the nano-SIM standard was to meet a production schedule for a device that used it (possibly the new iPhone).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Frand?</p>
<p>insert can&#8217;t tell if serious meme here</p>
<blockquote>I think one thing the jury should have ruled not infringing was pinch to zoom and perhaps the patent office should have been careful with awarding the patents. Or it should be FRAND by now.</blockquote>
<p>FRAND patents are not decided by law. The creators of technology sometimes VOLUNTEER to sign themselves up the obligation that is FRAND terms &#8211; because they believe it will increase their sales and profit.</p>
<p>It is never done for the good of the industry, or for any &#8216;good&#8217; motivations &#8211; it&#8217;s always done for profit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe Apple have every claimed to have patented specific gestures except for possibly the inane &#8220;slide to unlock&#8221;. Jobs said they have patented &#8220;mutli-touch&#8221;. When I saw the keynote where he declared this I assumed he was talking about both the hardware and software heuristics that determine multi-touch input into specific gestures, rather than the specific gestures themselves.</p>
<p>Depends on what level of specificity you are look for.  Interpreting one finger as scroll, and two fingers as scale seems as specific as you would want.  Specific enough to claim infringement, while broad enough to cover most implementations.</p>
<p>After reading this, I still don&#8217;t understand how this doesn&#8217;t patent pinch to zoom.  If EVERY point has to be met, the point Nilay highlighted is about sensing input, but the last point is about interpreting two fingers as a gesture, and then scaling the screen.  How is this not pinch to zoom?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m inclined to believe a Google engineer when they say this is specific and that they can work around it; but, the language still sounds super broad to me.</p>
<p>As a programmer, it is about a pretty specific method of decision making how to respond to gestures.</p>
<p>A long time ago, a clean room DOS clone was created &#8211; they did it by supplying API documentation and then implementing a stack machine based version instead of an x86 register based version. Result &#8211; totally different methods to accomplish the same functionality. This is specific enough to allow many other methods of decision making.</p>
<p>Not sure if serious.</p>
<p>People cared last week in the comments when they were trying to justify Apple&#8217;s victory. Now all the sudden when Nilay proves everyone wrong, the excuse is &#8220;who cares?&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t prove anyone wrong. He gave his opinion on the subject and if you follow these trials you should know the time they spend on construction.</p>
<p>He did prove &#8220;them&#8221; wrong in the sense that Apple has more mindshare and favorable press than legitimate ironclad patent defense in this instance.</p>
<p>And that is more than enough to obviously win cases.</p>
<p>Samsung might want to review how they spend their legal budget as well.</p>
<p>Apple and Microsoft are winning case after case against Android OEMs. Nilay&#8217;s opinion is just one of many.  Right now, the facts on the ground aren&#8217;t supporting Nilay&#8217;s assertions. I&#8217;m not a lawyer, I don&#8217;t even play one on TV and I didn&#8217;t sleep at a Holiday Inn Express last night, but I&#8217;ve heard other patent lawyers make the exact opposite claims of what Nilay just said. These patents can block pinch to zoom and it is very hard to work around these patents.</p>
<p>If this wasn&#8217;t the case why would Larry Page be meeting with Tim Cook right now? Android is on thin ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this wasn’t the case why would Larry Page be meeting with Tim Cook right now? Android is on thin ice.&#8221;  &#8211; Your opinion obviously correct.</p>
<p>This war is going to last years and it&#8217;s never going to give any meaningful results to Apple. It&#8217;s just going to hurt both parties.</p>
<p>Prior art or small changes in Android will overcome Apple&#8217;s patents. So Apple is not going to win anything in the end. It&#8217;s just bullying. Which is also reflecting bad on Apple.</p>
<p>I would hope that Larry Page is trying to talk some sense into Tim Cook to knock it off with this nonsense.</p>
<blockquote>Your opinion obviously correct.</blockquote>
<p>The fact that opinions aren&#8217;t necessarily correct is his point. Which you just agreed with.</p>
<p>Name these patent lawyers you speak of? Links to their statements?</p>
<p>Opinions differ and yours is based on conjecture.<br />
So I guess I can realistically classify your view as a WAG.</p>
<p>Wild Ass Guess</p>
<p>You know who cares? Smart people trying to dispel iSheep.  You know how many times I&#8217;ve heard people this week alone tell me that Apple &#8220;invented&#8221; &#8220;Pinch to Zoom&#8221; because that&#8217;s what they read based out of a summarized / non-technical breakdown of the Samsung/Apple Lawsuit.</p>
<p>Good job Nilay. I always enjoy reading your articles.</p>
<p>Why do you care what they believe? If they think so it&#8217;s their problem, it shouldn&#8217;t be yours. Are you a missionary? ^^</p>
<p>These are the same people who vote, and use the same sort of reasoning to decide who they vote for. Then it&#8217;s everyone&#8217;s problem.</p>
<p>Truth is good, no matter on what level. Start with this, it might spread to other areas.</p>
<p>But the vote affects you and the decision what smartphone someone buys does not and knowing all about their smartphone internals wouldn&#8217;t affect their vote.<br />
I have no problems with any smartphone or any car or any politican but i have a problem with missionarys. They are just annoying. They answer questions no one ever asked. Just like vegans. I have no problem with them, too but you recognise most of them becasue they tell you that they don&#8217;t eat meat and not because you see them eat vegetables. I don&#8217;t care if you eat meat or not, I don&#8217;t care if you use Android or not, I don&#8217;t care if you like Apple or not but please, shut the f&#8230; up and don&#8217;t O_o</p>
<p>I gave a thump up instead of reply at first, &#8220;sorry&#8221;. :D</p>
<p>PS: Before I got an iPhone not a single iPhone user came to me and said &#8220;I don&#8217;t like your phone. My phone is better than yours.&#8221; and so on. But after I got an iPhone &#8220;dozens&#8221; of Android users did. Who is the &#8220;fanatic&#8221; now?</p>
<p>Before the iPhone you had no friends.</p>
<p>After the iPhone, nothing changes.</p>
<p>None of my friends judge someone by their phones. If yours do so you better get some new.</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t talking about friends, he said &#8216;Android users&#8217;.</p>
<p>Dude, my comment conveyed that. Read!</p>
<p>Correcting someone&#8217;s opinion and correcting someone&#8217;s misinterpretation of the facts are two completely separate things. I hoped that you&#8217;d be able to understand that.</p>
<p><strong>If</strong> you do so.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Now back to the regularly scheduled commentary after that scathing rebuttal by User:)&#8217;s</p>
<p><em>Honey?  Are we out of &#8230;&#8230;. </em></p>
<p>The intelligent person cares that&#8217;s who. Apple can prevent anyone else from using if it they have that patent. Or require huge licenses pr device, licenses that the end user has to pay in the end.<br />
Its one thing if you can&#8217;t make a physical gizmo which looks the same, but its quiet another when they prevent others from using what is a common interface today.<br />
If apple were making cars they shouldn&#8217;t get a patent on ROUND WHEELS &#8211; sure anybody else could make a car, as long as they used SQUARE WHEELS. Clearly this is sick.</p>
<blockquote>but its quiet another when they prevent others from using what is a common interface today.</blockquote>
<p>How prevalent an interface is &#8216;today&#8217; is absolutely irrelevant to the validity of a patent. When Apple filed the patent, it wasn&#8217;t on any other smartphones, and that&#8217;s what counts.</p>
<p>Just because it has been infringed by a lot of devices doesn&#8217;t mean that it hasn&#8217;t been infringed.</p>
<p>Round wheels have been around since long before cars, which is why no patent on that would succeed &#8211; obviousness. Pinch to zoom hasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p><strong>Who cares who invented "pinch to zoom"?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of people who own Apple stock do I bet. There&#8217;s a lot of money on the table here and everyone in the industry has the same goal &#8212; to get as much of it as they can. It&#8217;s really as simple as that. No need to over/under think it. It&#8217;s not really about lawyers, innovation, etc. It&#8217;s about who gets the money. Apple doesn&#8217;t go after little companies who don&#8217;t make much (any) money. Samsung doesn&#8217;t copy little companies who haven&#8217;t had commercial success with their innovations.</p>
<p>Apple cares, because they can make money at it the old fashion way, by sueing their competition out of business.</p>
<p>The verge needs to stop with its factual bull. Facts are not welcome.</p>
<p>Reporting on the facts is proper reporting and journalism. Giving your opinion on somthing without educating your readers is blogging. The Verge is not a blog. If you want opinionated pieces, go over to Huffington Post.</p>
<p>Rory has not discovered sarcasm yet. shame.</p>
<p>The easy way out</p>
<p>It was obviously sarcasm.</p>
<p>LEave Rory ALONE !!!!!!   He was the boy who waited 2000 years for his true love Amy Pond, so noble.</p>
<p>Did you just fuse Chris Crocker to a Doctor Who reference? Well played.</p>
<p>No flaming or trolling, you genuinely let that one over your head.  Sorry.</p>
<p>21 Recommends to Mock5 and zero to you says otherwise.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t consider recommends to be a definite measure of validity, but I do agree &#8211; the sarcasm in the original comment was clear.</p>
<p>Welcome to internet.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s no shortcut home.</p>
<p>Maybe it was so sarcastic, no one has even seen sarcasm like it in the history of literature!</p>
<p>Maybe Rory was being sarcastic? Geezus, I certainly hope so..</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with your terms.  Blog is short for &#8220;web log&#8221;.  It&#8217;s someone&#8217;s thoughts, opinions and announcements logged on the web.  Whether it contains facts or opinion is determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>A blogger can be a journalist and a journalist can be a blogger.  It&#8217;s really just a title.  We typically hold journalists to a higher standard.</p>
<p>I would consider The Verge a blog.</p>
<p>The Verge is not a blog???  These aren&#8217;t just opinion pieces, loosely based on some snippet of an opinion piece on someone else&#8217;s site or something off the AP wire with little or no fact checking prior to print?  Wow, I&#8217;m going to have to be more critical.</p>
<p>So I should belive the Verge when they say the reason the iPhone 4s sales are sliding in China is due to the iPhone 5, a phone that does not even exist? Yet that article was written with zero facts at all.</p>
<p>The fact is the Huffinton post reports news just like the Verge, but at the same time they both write editorials pieces for us to read. You have no idea what you are talking about and I cannot tell if you just posted to troll.</p>
<p>If you consider the Huffington post legitimate news, which if you are a flaming liberal I guess it is, you need to get away from the computer more often.</p>
<p>Um, it&#8217;s a repeating historical pattern that Apples sales slow just before the release of a new product &#8211; for obvious reasons. The sales slow everywhere, including China.</p>
<p>For most people, that is evidence enough.</p>
<p>A phone that will not be released in China for probably another year. Yes sales are sliding because the iPhone 5 when they just got the 4s a few months ago.</p>
<blockquote>A phone that will not be released in China for probably another year.</blockquote>
<p>That is just nonsense. The iPhone 4S was released in China on 13th January &#8211; 8 months ago. The new iPhone will likely be released more quickly into the Chinese markets, likely this year. That&#8217;s why sales are slowing.</p>
<p>You obviously missed the sarcasm in that, but giving your opinion is actually called &#8220;Editorial&#8221; (not &#8220;blogging&#8221;).  Blogging is just mouthing off on a public Internet site.  Blogging is almost always editorial.  I think both &#8220;reporting&#8221; and &#8220;editorial&#8221; fall under &#8220;journalism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hold your head in shame. Us Brits believe Americans don&#8217;t get sarcasm (not true mind you) because of things like this!</p>

<p><strong>No dammit!!!!<br />
If it is on the internet it has to be true!<br />
The internet said so!!!!</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m always saying that and here it is on the Internet.  Proof that it is true!</p>
<p>True, they should do what all the other intelligent commentary has done and sum up the whole argument as <em>Apple patented a rectangle</em>. The end.</p>
<p>What!?!?!?!  Apple patented rounded rectangles and multi-touch?  Our patent office is so lame.  I demand reform!  This is a total abuse of the patent system!</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>The lamest thing about Samsung&#8217;s response to the trial was that they cited &#8220;rounded rectangles&#8221; when in fact the iPad design and trade dress was deemed not protectable by the jury.  Samsung&#8217;s narrative is so flawed in all of this.</p>
<p>They did not find that the trade dress was &#8216;not protectable&#8217;.</p>
<p>They found that it wasn&#8217;t infringed upon.</p>
<p>Nilay is a law fanboi. He is bias towards the law.</p>
<p>Thank you! Finally. If I had a dime for every time someone said Apple&#8217;s patented P2Z, I&#8217;d be a rich man.</p>
<p>Are we calling it &#8220;P2Z&#8221; now?</p>
<p>No. I will have no part in it. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
<p>Goodbye is also known as GB.</p>
<p>I thought we all agreed GB was gingerbread.</p>
<p>Pee2Zee</p>
<p>its all about who patents it first, not about invention.</p>
<p>you better believe it because Apple has never invented anything just patented stuff others invented</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually not true in the US, until March 16th of next year we are a first to invent country, counter to the rest of the world&#8217;s first to file system, if you can show you made it first an issued patent is revoked. I&#8217;m sad to see it go, it will only serve to assist large companies stealing ideas. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_to_file_and_first_to_invent">First to File vs First to Invent</a></p>
<p>True and its sad Google played a part in pushing through that change.</p>
<p>But then a patent can be invalidated by prior art so that&#8217;s not the end of it</p>
<p>Invalidating is expensive &#8211; someone has to foot the bill.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m a bit confused&#8230;  How is:</p>
<p>• [&#8230;]two or more input points applied to the touch-sensitive display that are interpreted as the gesture operation;<br />
• responding to at least one gesture call, if issued, <strong>by scaling </strong>the view associated with the event object based on receiving the two or more input points in the form of the user input.</p>
<p>not P2Z?  I&#8217;m not defending Apple, but just asking a question.</p>
<p>You need to hit ALL the claims. Every single one. You never get to two-finger scaling if you don&#8217;t have single-finger scrolling.</p>
<p>So it seems like Google  had to implement a much more complex scrolling.</p>
<p>Detect if multiple inputs are registered, check if all inputs are moving in parallel. If they are moving in parallel then scroll and if they are not moving in parallel scale?</p>
<p>Also, can anyone verify that on iOS you cannot scroll up and down with two or more fingers on the screen? Keep in mind that different applications might have different behavior.</p>
<p>you can use two fingers in messages, maps (in any direction), mail, and safari to scroll (and probably others, didn&#8217;t feel like testing all of them). Just because more than one way of implementation is used in the OS doesn&#8217;t mean all the ways that work are covered by the patent, though.</p>
<p>You can scroll with two fingers.</p>
<p>You can also scroll and zoom with two fingers <strong>simultaneously</strong>.</p>
<p>You  mean all ELEMENTS of a single claim, not ALL CLAIMS of the patent</p>
<p>Yes. My mistake — writing fast.</p>
<p>if only you could edit verge comments :-P</p>
<p>The Verge should take Facebook&#8217;s idea, I call it theirs because I&#8217;ve never seen it elsewhere, for edits. Offer the ability to edit (comments), but also offer an edit history for all to look at.</p>
<p>People can&#8217;t change their arguments because you can simply look at the edit history and see what they originally said, whilst saving people from typos and such.</p>
<p>Ok- so then what exactly is the point of this patent, then?  If such a simple work around- which has little to no impact on the actual behavior the user experiences- gets you around it, then what does Apple actually gain by this patent?  Is it simply that Apple WAS trying to patent generic pinch to zoom, but they blew it by letting their language get too specific, so lucky for everyone we can still have pinch to zoom in other products thanks to a workaround?  This is all such nonsense; software patents are broken.</p>
<p>Wait &#8211; how can you simultaneously ask how the patent can be so narrow and then say that software patents are broken?</p>
<p>The jurors were only asked if claim 8 was violated.</p>
<p>Ok never mind, saw the correction.</p>
<p>Single finger scrolling works on my Nexus 7 as well as two finger scrolling.</p>
<p>Some of the media reporting of the trial results has been pretty bad. Almost no different from when you see a troll / fanboy post in the forums. National publications should at least fact check their stories: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/apple-rot-starts-with-samsung-lawsuit-win" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/apple-rot-starts-with-samsung-lawsuit-win</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to get Stephen Fry to write tech articles and reviews (Fry is responsible for one of the best pieces on the history of smartphones amongst oh so many other things), but articles like the one you link to just&#8230;<br />
The last bit alone is so pompous it&#8217;s ridiculous. Yes, it&#8217;s an opinion piece, but it is also an example of what is wrong with the media at large, in print and online &#8211; if they want to be taken seriously, they need to be serious about what they do.</p>
<p>The Guardian clearly are so desperate for clicks, I guess they&#8217;re going to allow such nonsense under their masthead.</p>
<p>Oh yes, [name of my favorite news source] would <em>never</em> do something like that.  It is perfect and pristine and couldn&#8217;t possibly stoop to such depths.  It would only ever write things I agree with.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an atrocious headline from The Associated Press (the article itself is reasonable):</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s $1B patent verdict could corner smartphone market&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/apple-s-1b-patent-verdict-could-corner-smartphone-market-1.930385" target="_blank">http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/apple-s-1b-patent-verdict-could-corner-smartphone-market-1.930385</a></p>
<p>And of course the articles about how Android&#8217;s defeat (through Samsung as proxy) will mean that Microsoft takes over and crushes both Google and Apple:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/mobile/can-nokia-and-windows-phone-benefit-from-samsung-defeat/article4500753/" target="_blank">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/mobile/can-nokia-and-windows-phone-benefit-from-samsung-defeat/article4500753/</a></p>
<p>This is what you get when news is marketed as entertainment.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, so Apple&#8217;s specific patent on a pinch-to-zoom implementation led Google to develop a workaround that involved an improved single-finger behavior? How is this a bad thing?</p>
<p>Google had to use its resources to develop a workaround &lt;- that is waste of resource. It would have been much easier to copy than develop a work around.</p>
<p>great attitude to have. thumbs up!  /s</p>
<p>Improvement is a waste of resources. *noted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a wasted resource because it have to work-around something that already exist.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#8217;s like finding two different way to arrive at the same destination.</p>
<p>1 pattent 1+1 = 2. The other have to walk around by going 0-2+2+2 = 2.</p>
<p>So if something exists it&#8217;s ok for anyone to just copy it even though someone else took all the time to create it otherwise?  Yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Did I said that it is okay to copy something that already exist? If I did, sorry but clearly I don&#8217;t remember saying anything like that. /s</p>
<p>I was just stating some fact. Fact: It is a waste of resource to try and design a work around for something that already exist.</p>
<p>If the patent remains valid (I understand that some of the 12 patents that have been use during trial are under re-evaluation) and that Samsung wants to use it, they would have to pay Apple for it. That&#8217;s would be fair.</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s my problem with software patent. In my opinon, in order to prove that Samsung copy Apple on that patent, we will needs to prove that they are using the exact same code (excluding variable). Now that&#8217;s what I called copy. Nobody knows what code Samsung used for the Pinch to Zoom and nobody knows what code Apple used for the same patent. Otherwise, it would be considered reaching the same conclusion using 2 differents technique. Woudn&#8217;t that be more logic?</p>
<p>Example: Company A create a software using 500 line allowing a device to perform an action. Company B like the idea and decide to recreate the same software using the same 500 lines. That&#8217;s copy.</p>
<p>Now, if company B, inspired by Company A, manage to create the same software but using only 350 lines of code. Would that be logical for Company A to sue Company B when Company B actually improve the program by making it more efficient? I mean, the final product is the same but the steps used are different. If you say yes, then you actually for stopping innovation.</p>
<p>Another things that I have problem with. If I ask anybody who had used a touchscreen surface before and asked then to pinch on the screen, I hope we all agree that the expecting behavior is that it would zoom into that section. If that the case, shouldn&#8217;t that be considered an Industry standard?</p>
<p>And why it is okay to use FRAND defence on technical innovation but not on software, especially software that should be define as standard? The whole point of FRAND is so that those Companies cannot abuse of their invention that are part of the industry standard. Yet, we alllowed software patent to stay out of it. Personally, if a software set a standard for the industry, the company that created the software should be able to license it at a fair rate ($30+ is not a fair rate) and profit from it. Else, it seems to me that it is just a way of controling the market by stiffing competition.</p>
<p>I guess I just have problem with software patent. As for Samsung vs Apple, while I completely agree that Samsung copy Apple on their trade dress, those software patent are too far strech for me.</p>
<p>I was attempting to respond to the OP on this not you directly. Looks like it either mis-assigned or i misclicked.  tillman in this case.</p>
<p>And I disagree.  It&#8217;s not a waste of resources to work around something that exists.  You can often do it better, this is what innovation is about.   Going by your logic nearly any R&amp;D after someone comes up with something in an area is a waste and should not be done.  That would do us a lot of good if everyone thought that.</p>
<p>You seriously don&#8217;t understand FRAND.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And why it is okay to use FRAND defence on technical innovation but not on software, especially software that should be define as standard?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are FRAND patentes that are purely software, such as the FRAND patents on H.264.  The determinant for whether a patent is FRAND or not is whether the patent holder agreed to make it so in order for it to be included in an industry standard.</p>
<p>Industry standards are created when interoperation is more important than differentiation and competition.</p>
<p>That applies when you&#8217;re talking about making a device talk to its network, or a new video format.  It doesn&#8217;t apply to UI design &#8211; which is why nobody has ever sought to produce an industry standard for UIs.</p>
<p>No it&#8217;s not. Why even bother if you cannot profit from the R&amp;D, there isn&#8217;t any incentive and that is dangerous to innovation.</p>
<p>Stops innovation apparently. Copying is innovation now, and creating new things is inconvenience or bad for the consumer or something. I can&#8217;t keep up.</p>
<p>No no no! You can&#8217;t innovate if your not allowed to copy! Wait&#8230; you can&#8217;t copy if you don&#8217;t first innovate&#8230; that&#8217;s not right. hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh! You have to think of innovative ways to copy.</p>
<p>We need a new term&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Copyvation.</strong><br />
<em>verb</em><br />
To innovate your way around someone else&#8217;s idea in an attempt to copy them.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p><strong>Copytetion</strong><br />
verb<br />
To compete with somebody by copying them as closely as possible, hopefully without being sued into the ground.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t we just use the verb &#8216;to Samsung&#8217;?</p>
<p>And once the word is in regular use we must make great efforts to substitute it with <strong><em>Copyvention</em></strong>. Because the &#8220;Apple doesn&#8217;t innovate, they just take existing things and improve upon them&#8221;, argument is a lot more fun when people confuse innovation with invention.</p>
<p>And Apple improves on these things through&#8230;innovation.  And quality assurance, of course.  God forbid people buy Apple&#8217;s products because they&#8217;re improved.</p>
<p>I think that is exactly the point he was making; folks on the Interwebs seem to confuse invention with innovation even tho they are two very distinct things. It is just a new twist on the old &#8220;Sony memory stick is &#8216;proprietary&#8217; but (Mash-Panasonic) Secure Digital Cards are not.&#8221; thing.</p>
<p>TL;DR &#8211; People that comment on blogs often have no effing idea what they are talking about ;)</p>
<p>I prefer Imangination-itate:<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/s5l-nnR4Bx0" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/s5l-nnR4Bx0</a></p>
<p>Guys guys&#8230; guys&#8230;</p>
<p>What if we patent copying.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ll find that Samsung has prior art on that one</p>
<p>I think <em>always</em> panning around the screen and not locking you to a single direction is a step down in usability.  At least, most times I am choosing a distinct direction to scroll or pan to.  And iOS generally does let you pan around anywhere if you start with a diagonal swipe instead of a N, S, E, W one.</p>
<p>Well, Nilay is wrong here. I&#8217;m typing this on a Nexus 7 and it definitely locks when panning, albeit probably not as aggresively as Safari on iOS. Maybe it&#8217;s enough of a difference to avoid the patents.</p>
<p>Chrome does (sort of) GMail doesn&#8217;t &#8211; iOS always does. And never unlocks.</p>
<p>GMail does as well. In the same way that Chrime does.</p>
<p>The patent doesn&#8217;t say where the scroll is locked or not in a particular direction. Panning is the same as scrolling.</p>
<p>Its not clear that this is improved single-finger behavior.  When the browser (for example) has scaled the width of the page to cover 100% of the width of the display, you don&#8217;t want single finger movements to move in 2 dimensions, you want scrolling.</p>
<p>When the width of the page = the width of the screen, you can&#8217;t do anything but scroll.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not improved, it&#8217;s just different, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a bad thing, it&#8217;s also bad because they are trying to act like they invented/own multitouch and gestures, and it&#8217;s bad because fanboys all over the world are believing it rather than getting to know the history behind multitouch.</p>
<p>So who did invent multi touch on smartphones, then?</p>
<p>Show me the device before the iPhone which had it?</p>
<p>I think you meant &#8220;who <strong>applied</strong> multi touch on smart phones&#8221;. Nice try fanboy, stop using the word &#8220;invent&#8221;.</p>
<p>The mistake you make is confusion invention of a concept with invention of an implementation. Apple has patented it&#8217;s own invention which is the IMPLEMENTATION of multi touch on smartphones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting for an answer as to who did it before them?</p>
<p>Apple hasn&#8217;t patented multi touch on any device, which is where your logic fails.</p>
<p>confusing*</p>
<p>Nilay, please also write about the myth that Apple stole Xerox GUI myth that has been perpetuated by a lot of national publications including Guardian.</p>
<p>And I will provide the research material: <a href="http://obamapacman.com/2010/03/myth-copyright-theft-apple-stole-gui-from-xerox-parc-alto/7/" target="_blank">http://obamapacman.com/2010/03/myth-copyright-theft-apple-stole-gui-from-xerox-parc-alto/7/</a></p>
<p>I would enjoy reading an article by Nilay, or other Verge legal writers on that topic as well.</p>
<p>stole.. copied.. what&#8217;s the difference between stealing and borderline frauding it from xerox? not that it matters since what xerox guys and research from that era should show is that the gui is an obvious idea straight away after you have enough memory on the machine.</p>
<p>Copying is just that, copying. Stealing is taking something without permission. They&#8217;re not the same.</p>
<p>Your right. Turns out factually that Microsoft also visited Parc around the same time as Apple &amp; saw the same tech demos. I guess they didn&#8217;t steal the GUI from Apple huh?</p>
<p>Um &#8211; have you ever seen the Star/Alto user interface?  Microsoft clearly didn&#8217;t copy it, but rather copied the Mac.</p>
<p>Sorry Cloud that logic doesn&#8217;t work anymore. This last week since Apple vs Samsung has definitively proved &amp; codified to the masses one revelation. That being if there is no patent or court case to back up your supposed theory of what happened it isn&#8217;t true. This article alone shows how popular belief in a fiction has made it truth. If it&#8217;s believable to constantly claim Microsoft stole the GUI from Apple, with absolutely no proof, it&#8217;s just as believable to take Bill Gates at his word too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This article alone shows how popular belief in a fiction has made it truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh? No &#8211; it shows that popular belief in a fiction has made people go nuts and set their hair on fire complaining about something that isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>Try reading the comments of all these internet patent experts that have materialized from the thin air then. Everybody in most tech sites &amp; the larger media seem to believe that Apple has the exclusive rights to this tech. We know they do not. Some of us have always known. But as this article above shows definitively, people start to believe the oft repeated lie &amp; then it becomes fact.</p>
<p>Much like the belief that Apple has the patent on multi touch. Which they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Oh &amp; your assertions on Microsoft copying the Mac? Good luck with that. Hurry up &amp; prove won&#8217;t you so this 25 year old argument can be laid to rest.</p>
<p>Microsoft never really denied it &#8211; their (successful) defence was that Apple had licensed the key elements back when they were first creating Windows 1.</p>
<p>So that proves what? That Microsoft didn&#8217;t get a look at the tech demos at Parc too? Nope try again.</p>
<p>If they did then they didn&#8217;t get double-click, drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop or fixed menu&#8217;s there &#8211; because xerox didn&#8217;t have any of those things.</p>
<p>Um&#8230;they <strong>didn&#8217;t</strong>.  And I&#8217;d love for you to link your source for Microsoft being present for any demonstrations at PARC.</p>
<p>Or paying Xerox to do so.</p>
<p>No problem. Reference the Steve Jobs biography:</p>
<p>Page 177</p>
<p><strong></strong>&quot;They were right to worry. Gates believed that graphical interfaces were the future, and that Microsoft has just as much right as Apple did to copy what had been developed at Xerox PARC. As he freely admitted later, &#8220;We sort of say, &#8217;Hey, we believe in graphics interfaces, we saw the Xerox Alto too.&#8221;<em></em></p>
<p>Another:</p>
<p>Page 177</p>
<p>quote Bill Gates,</p>
<p> &#8220;Well, Steve, I think there&#8217;s more than one way of looking at it. I think it&#8217;s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>One more for link aficionados;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking CNN is pretty credible source too. Much more so than Clouds favorite of Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Note the dedicated keys on the keyboard for copying files, opening files etc. You really think that Microsoft went back to the xerox roots?  Seriously?</p>
<p>Nice deflection. But you still have not proved anything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll end this with you now before you turn to the trollish insulting you did in the comments of the article about Florian Mueller a few days ago.</p>
<p>Nice attempt to ignore the fact I just provided you with a detailed exposition of the Xerox UI that destroys your point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll end this before I shame you further.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve shamed nothing. Just trolled for a while with no facts. Nice chatting with ya though.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know why I read through this whole comment thread, but wow, are you guys childish.</p>
<p>Ok &#8211; but when you get the time watch those youtube videos, because it&#8217;s fascinating to see both how advanced and how basic the xerox UI actually was.</p>
<p>Damn! We&#8217;ve been caught&#8230;</p>
<p>He knows we are children ; )</p>
<p>Your sources do not agree with my opinion therefore they are false.</p>
<p>No. The comments are filled with people saying things like, &#8220;OMG, how did apple get pinch to zoom patented! I know that there is prior art at Samsung proved it at trial!&#8221;</p>
<p>When that wasn&#8217;t the patent asserted. See also, rounded rectangles.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how that went down to be honest so can&#8217;t comment. There&#8217;s no reason Microsoft didn&#8217;t strike a deal with Xerox too, the same way Apple did.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corporation">From Wikipedia:  </a><em>&quot;Apple had agreed to license certain parts of its GUI to Microsoft for use in Windows 1.0, but when Microsoft made changes in Windows 2.0 adding overlapping windows and other features found in the Macintosh GUI, Apple filed suit. Apple added additional claims to the suit when Microsoft released Windows 3.0.</em></p>
<p>Apple claimed the &#8220;look and feel&#8221; of the Macintosh operating system, taken as a whole, was protected by copyright, and that each individual element of the interface (such as the existence of windows on the screen, the rectangular appearance of windows, windows could be resized, overlap, and have title bars) was not as important as all these elements taken together. After oral arguments, the court insisted on an analysis of specific GUI elements that Apple claimed were infringements. Apple listed 189 GUI elements; the court decided that 179 of these elements had been licensed to Microsoft in the Windows 1.0 agreement and most of the remaining 10 elements were not copyrightable—either they were unoriginal to Apple, or they were the only possible way of expressing a particular idea.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Xerox certainly felt that Apple stole their GUI.</p>
<p>Typical, people think just because apple do it, they must have started it. Starting to get on my nerves!</p>
<p>Typical, people think that just because after getting used to something that Apple created and popularised, that it&#8217;s obvious and therefore Apple didn&#8217;t create it. Starting to get on my nerves!</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>That makes sense.</p>
<p>Clearly &#8220;Patented!&#8221; sounds somewhat for multitouch screen, but in general what Jobs said is that everything is patented: gestures, apps, design, trade dress, etc.</p>
<p>Fantastic article.  Long live the Verge.</p>
<p>Wow. I think this is one of the first Nilay posts that I completely and totally agree with. Great article, Nilay! Thanks for the clarification on something that most people simply don&#8217;t understand, myself included (the nuances of Apple&#8217;s multi-touch patents). Though I think it just further goes to show how ridiculously hard it is to tell if you&#8217;re infringing a patent before you design and create a product. Certainly, the likes of big companies like Google, who have large pockets, can go through and analyze these patents in detail, but for smaller companies, digging into the nuances of these patents exhaustively will be tedious, difficult, and prohibitively expensive. Hence the reason why most smaller companies/start-ups simply ignore software patents.</p>
<p>Is Samsung a smaller company / Start-Up?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to defend Samsung or anyone else specifically here. Samsung is obviously a larger company among &#8220;the likes of big companies like Google&#8221;. I&#8217;m more musing about the deficiencies of the current patent system, specifically as relates to software patents. It&#8217;s ironic, in fact, that when we discuss the virtues of patents, we often talk about how they protect the innovations of the little guys against the larger corporate monsters like Samsung, Apple, Microsoft, and Google who are trying to steal said innovations. It&#8217;s ironic, because software patents are often too expensive to invest in for many smaller start-ups, and even if the money/resources were there to invest in them, the big guys simply have too many broad software patents for any small company to reasonably stand a chance. Furthermore, when designing a product, if they try to design around existing software patents, their task becomes intractable, as they have the daunting task of finding tens or hundreds of needles (individual patent claims) buried in thousands of haystacks (patents). It&#8217;s a huge investment and a colossal waste of money. There&#8217;s a good read on this over at Ars Technica: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/opinion-the-problem-with-software-patents-they-dont-scale/" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/opinion-the-problem-with-software-patents-they-dont-scale/</a></p>
<p>Appreciate the link. <br />
I think there should be some fund created from these lawsuit victories (a small %) to pay for those small start-ups legal defence on strong cases. Yes, I know the big, big companies can still dwarf their legal bills, but it might make some of those companies think twice and just pay a license (or buy the company for their IP)&#8230;</p>
<p>Poor little Samsung&#8230;.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;a master salesman&#8221;</strong><br />
That should be the writing on Jobs&#8217; gravestone because it is the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth&#8221; hardly seems like the criteria we should be using to determine what is put on people&#8217;s gravestones.  By that metric, &#8220;asshole&#8221; could go on a lot of people&#8217;s graves (perhaps even Steve Jobs&#8217;) but I&#8217;m not sure we would want that.</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>If we put the truth on gravestones, men would be insufferable because all of them would want &#8220;A huge dick lies below.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>Oh hell no. You could power the machine that spins you in your grave with the snickers of passers by.</p>
<p>Because huge swaths of the media is lazy and spends half its day refreshing Reddit for facts/story ideas promoted by teenage Aderall-addicts.  The Apple haters on Reddit will then link to those stories and claim it as a source when they cite it elsewhere.</p>
<p>So, since JB is the only Android version mentioned that does not implement in Apple&#8217;s patented way, does thatmean every earlier version does? Not one phone has launched with jellybean yet, and the launching software was important in the trial.  Does this mean every android manufacturer is in big trouble?</p>
<p>Hopefully it means JB updates are coming quicker to customers.</p>
<p>This, ladies and gentlemen is why I come to The Verge for tech news. While all other competitors are busy with flamebait articles (looking at your BGR), you guys are producing nothing but quality reporting (although I don&#8217;t always agree with them&#8230;).</p>
<p>The media also likes to state that Google is in trouble because Apple won the case and I just laugh because thats BS and they also state the Nexus S 4G is a phone also effected and that is also a lie.  Google&#8217;s Nexus devices were not on the block in this case.</p>

<p>I ♥ Nilay Patel</p>
<p>U R Biazed.</p>
<p>Good write-up. More like this please.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs &quot; was a master salesman at work&quot; ..i&#8217;d say &#8220;a Liar&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never purchased a car, have you?</p>
<p>I did,but i tend to get informed about what i&#8217;m going to buy.<br />
Anyway we are talking about a CEO,not about a single salesman in his showroom.The last one may lie to some costumer,the other speaks directly to the entire world..</p>
<p>So exactly where did he lie about &#8220;Boy, have we patented it&#8221;? Apple did patent multi-touch and other iPhone related technologies. Exactly which ones were patented and what were the specific claims against them can be debated all day long. But where did he lie?</p>
<p>Sorry, it was meant for your reply to me below.</p>
<p>You find this to be a very important issue&#8230; I feel sorry for you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say they are essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>The products and Apple&#8217;s success speak for themselves.</p>
<p>What i said has nothing to do with Apple or apple&#8217;s product..they&#8217;re awesome.<br />
A bit overpriced (here in europe),but still awesome.<br />
I&#8217;m talking about the systematic and volunteer tecnique of misinformation used to make the costumers think far from the reality of facts.</p>
<p>So exactly where did he lie about "Boy, have we patented it"? Apple did patent multi-touch and other iPhone related technologies. Exactly which ones were patented and what were the specific claims against them can be debated all day long. But where did he lie?</p>
<p>Pinch to zoom is one of the most overrated features of today&#8217;s smartphones.</p>
<p>Where is the down vote&#8230;</p>
<p>hear me out&#8230;its ok for samll refined zooming but i think double tap to zoom is hands down the  better, quick and easier way to quickly zoom into something.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t one of the Samsung lawyers claim &#8216;It is impossible to make a modern smartphone without infringing claim 8 of the &#8217;915 patent&#8217;. You mean he wasn&#8217;t telling the truth? And him a lawyer too, who&#8217;d of thought.</p>
<p>Exactly, the only part this article gets wrong is in assuming that the trivial workaround it suggests will avoid infringing the patent.</p>
<p>Certainly not certain.</p>
<p>Thanks for clearing this up Nilay!  One problem with this though, is that these scrolling gestures aren&#8217;t particularly relevant to an OS itself, but more to do with implementations within specific apps &#8211; specifically common apps such as the browser, and maps.  Could Apple sue an app developer if they didn&#8217;t like a certain implementation of scrolling within an app?  Obviously browser apps would be more at risk here, but games or even twitter clients could be at risk if they had a certain kind of scrolling&#8230;</p>
<p>The scrolling gestures are IMPLEMENTED by the OS. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that would be a pain for each and every developer to do for themselves, so the OS does the hard work and sends messages to the app telling it to scroll, zoom etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still a bit confused by this.  So the patent covers detecting whether the input is one finger that is mean to scroll or if it is two fingers intending some other behavior ( such as pinch to zoom)?</p>
<p>I think Google claims that the workaround in Jelly Bean is that the user has the freedom to scroll in any direction, and then introduce a second finger to pinch or spread&#8230;  but I feel like I must be missing something too.</p>
<p>The reason it&#8217;s confusing is that you&#8217;re not locked into one direction when scrolling with a single finger in iOS. So I don&#8217;t get it either.</p>
<p>Even though I&#8217;m still confused I still think it&#8217;s a good article and I really like the work being done by Nilay.</p>
<p>Nilay I have never thanked you for writing anything. But <strong>THANK YOU SO MUCH</strong> for writing this. I hate when myth becomes truth, drives me crazy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcKqyn-gUbY">I had hoped you would have mentioned Jeff Han&#8217;s presentation as well.</a></p>
<p>This <strong>TRUTH</strong> is propagated by Android fanboys, trying to make out like Apple patented something generic.</p>
<p>He should write a similar article on why Apple&#8217;s design patents are about more than &#8216;rectangles with rounded corners&#8217; &#8211; to educated the sensationalists who describe it as such.</p>
<p>my question here: is this the only feature that Apple gets credit by the people/media for what it does not own :P</p>
<p>Does Apple not own the iPhone &amp; iPad designs?</p>
<p>Since they are arguably the things that people give them the most credit for&#8230;.</p>
<p>Great article.</p>
<p>Thank you Nilay. You have given me one strong reason to come to the Verge. Bold and insightful. Great job!</p>
<p>Oh Nilay&#8230;</p>
<p>From Wikipedia for scrolling (yes, I know it&#8217;s not the bible but neither is Nilay): <br />
<blockquote>In computer displays, filmmaking, television production, and other kinetic displays, scrolling is sliding text, images or video across a monitor or display, often vertically. &#8220;Scrolling&#8221;, as such, does not change the layout of the text or pictures, but moves (pans or tilts) the user&#8217;s view across what is apparently a larger image that is not wholly seen.</blockquote></p>
<p>Panning is Scrolling</p>
<p>Thank you. I was wondering why Nilay said that Google&#8217;s implementation does not infringe the patent, when it clearly does every part of the claim, but I guess that he&#8217;s making a distinction between scrolling and panning.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t make the distinction between scrolling and panning, and I do not, it&#8217;s a bit disingenuous to say that Apple doesn&#8217;t have a patent on Pinch to zoom when they have a patent on <em>pinch to zoom wherever you can also pan</em>, ie. every single implementation of pinch to zoom on a touchscreen ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, this spirt vs letter of the law.  If you step back and look at the step by step of Samsung&#8217;s hardware and software development, it&#8217;s blatantly obvious that they ripped off Apple.  With all this squabbling over the details, I&#8217;d say they got off pretty easy, and unfortunately showed that you can still make a profit by copying even after paying the penalty.</p>
<p>If anybody hasn&#8217;t checked out Sony&#8217;s SmartSkin paper from 2002, it&#8217;s actually a quite informative read about some of the very earliest multitouch work.  It&#8217;s a well written paper with a lot of well done graphics.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t investigated what, if any, patents Sony pursued from this but panning and pinch to zoom are certainly there.</p>
<p>Thanks, this is great.</p>
<p>This was used as evidence of prior art but found not to be relevant.</p>
<p>Just because something vague does something which produces a similar end result, doesn&#8217;t constitute prior art.</p>
<p>The standard of prior art is actually very high, to the point of requiring the art to be &#8216;interchangeable&#8217;. Sorry, but there&#8217;s simply no way that applies in this case.</p>
<p>The post has little to do with the Apple v. Samsung (mis)trial, and everything to do with the topic at hand involving the misconception that Apple invented pinch to zoom, if not multi-touch functionality.   That is flatly untrue.</p>
<p>With regards to your unprovoked argument regarding this being prior art at trial, that may be true.  However, Apple&#8217;s patent in this case is decidely very specific and reasonably complex in the claims it makes.  Patel describes it well enough in how all of the parts of the claim must be met to be infringed (and to show prior art).   The references do not meet that test because they do not perform all of apple&#8217;s patent&#8217;s claims.  This is actually one of the realistically defendable patents since it is specific and complex in nature.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t understand. Apple hasn&#8217;t patented &#8216;pinch to zoom&#8217;, it&#8217;s patented it&#8217;s SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION of pinch to zoom, which it has every right, legally to do.</p>
<p>Your &#8216;prior art&#8217; is therefore not relevant. The context of this article is the trial which Apple won &#8211; so discussing how relevant your comment is with regard to prior art is entirely consistent. Nothing &#8216;unprovoked&#8217; about it, at all. Most people reading your comment would interpret it as an argument of prior art.</p>
<p>In fairness to you, your second paragraph is entirely correct &#8211; and the point I was making.</p>
<p>One other big reason they did not find that the patent was invalid due to prior art <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120828225612963" target="_blank">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20120828225612963</a></p>
<p>QUOTE:  &#8220;The software on the Apple side could not be placed into the processor on the prior art and vice versa. That means they are not interchangeable. That changed everything right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>That right there should basically invalidate a large chunk of the verdict.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually pretty sure that what the jurors say on subsequent interviews about how they reached a verdict is irrelevant for the appeal.</p>
<p>Thankfully juries aren&#8217;t the deciding factor in what is &amp; is not relevant for appeal. Juries have convicted countless people who DNA is now available to prove innocence. Thx to the appeals process that this jury things it&#8217;ll be immune from.</p>
<p>AGREED!</p>
<p>While the standard he applied is too high (namely taking the specific software and running it) &#8211; prior art does require that the technology itself which was patented is interchangeable. This doesn&#8217;t mean having to run on the same hardware, but it does mean that the basic mechanics and fundamentals have to be the same.</p>
<p>None of the &#8216;prior art&#8217; presented met this criteria.</p>
<blockquote>Astute industry observers will note that the Nexus 7 running Jelly Bean has pinch-to-zoom.</blockquote>
<p>Hah!</p>
<p>So it infringes? Ouch.</p>
<p>Well, if that&#8217;s the case, can Google go ahead and fucking implement pinch-to-zoom in Google Maps as well? The stupid zoom bar throws my muscle memory off all the time.</p>
<p>Did you bother reading the article? It&#8217;s only an issue if it is implemented in the way claimed by Apple&#8217;s patent. It&#8217;s perfectly possible to implement in a way that doesn&#8217;t infringe.</p>
<blockquote>It’s perfectly possible to implement in a way that doesn’t infringe.</blockquote>
<p>How?</p>
<p>RTFA, it says how there. Jelly Bean is non-infringing according to Nilay.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right Nilay, this patent isn&#8217;t pinch to zoom&#8230; It pretty much covers all of multitouch, or at least Claim 8 does. Let&#8217;s look at the claim:<br />
 * A machine readable storage medium storing executable program instructions which when executed cause a data processing system to perform a method comprising:<br />
Which means basically: &#8220;A computer that has the following functionality:&#8221;<br />
  * receiving a user input, the user input is one or more input points applied to a touch-sensitive display that is integrated with the data processing system<br />
  (The computer has a multitouch screen)<br />
 * creating an event object in response to the user input;<br />
 (The computer notices touches as &#8220;event objects&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure if the way around this is to use a prodedural language vs an object-oriented one.  Otherwise, this line seems to pretty much say nothing at all)<br />
 * Determining whether the event object invokes a scroll or gesture operation by distinguishing between a single input point applied to the touch-sensitive display that is interpreted as the scroll operation and two or more input points applied to the touch-sensitive display that are interpreted as the gesture operation<br />
 (the computer thinks of single finger gestures as &#8220;scrolls&#8221; and multiple finger gestures as &#8220;gestures&#8221;)<br />
 * issuing at least one scroll or gesture call based on invoking the scroll or gesture operation;<br />
 (internal implementation details. Once again, this says nothing, especially when given the points below)<br />
 * responding to at least one scroll call, if issued, by scrolling a window having a view associated with the event object; and<br />
 (scroll if the person did a (one-finger) scroll)<br />
 * responding to at least one gesture call, if issued, by scaling the view associated with the event object based on receiving the two or more input points in the form of the user input.<br />
 (do a gesture action if the person did a (multi-finger) gesture)</p>
<p>This seems to me that this claim would even cover two-finger scrolling. Am I wrong?</p>
<p>My interpretation is that &#8220;invokes a scroll or gesture operation&#8221; separates them out. They are discrete things that happen — one finger scrolls, multiple fingers perform gesture operations. The plain language indicates that they&#8217;re different.</p>
<p>More importantly, Google is on the record in this piece saying that Jelly Bean has software implementation designed around claim 8.</p>
<p>I suppose. I read it to mean that one finger scrolls, multiple fingers can perform a gesture that may include scrolling.  In any case, it&#8217;s a very broad claim: a device that will scroll when one finger is used and perform some sort of gesture when more fingers are used.</p>
<blockquote>More importantly, Google is on the record in this piece saying that Jelly Bean has software implementation designed around claim 8.</blockquote>
<p>In what way?</p>
<p>Possibly in ways they want to reveal in the midst of a lawsuit with apple. It would certainly be devastating if Apple&#8217;s patent warfare was brought to a decisive end during an ongoing trial.</p>
<p>Yeah, but doesn&#8217;t that then mean that doing anything based on multiple inputs after using a single finger to scroll is a violation. So not just pinch-to-zoom, but any multi fingered &#8220;gesture&#8221;.</p>
<p>I guess two fingered scrolling would circumvent this, but that would be annoying as hell.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&#8217;ll have to wait for the appeal, because the prior art really needs to be looked at again by someone who understands that it&#8217;s not just prior art if it runs on the same processor.</p>
<p>When you design a real-time system events must be mutable by nature &#8211; you can&#8217;t afford to sit around to see if it&#8217;s a single finger gesture or double finger gesture because system must respond within milliseconds and the users (when they want to do two-fingered gesture) won&#8217;t land the two fingers at exact same time for the system to determine which type of event it was. The only correct thing to do is to &#8220;assume&#8221; it was a scroll event when the first touch is registered and turn it into zoom event if second touch is registered within specified amount of time.</p>
<p>In other words &#8211; this patent describes the obvious to us programmers.</p>
<p>Well, this claim doesn&#8217;t really describe how the program determines what is a multiple finger gesture (aside from saying it&#8217;s &#8220;two or more inputs&#8221;). But I agree that this patent is obvious to programmers. Or at least to programmers who saw the Microsoft Surface or Minority Report.</p>
<p>Minority Report came out in 2002, I&#8217;m pretty sure FingerWorks was developing pinch-to-zoom before that.</p>
<p>But you can&#8217;t take Apple&#8217;s software and run it on the Minority Report processor.  Therefore prior art doesn&#8217;t apply.  This is the new standard for validating all prior art as established by the recent jury decision.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing in the patent specific to the processor, there is only the idea.  And the idea, expressed in Minority Report (with pinch to zoom, no less) is prior art to Apple&#8217;s idea. It kills the &#8220;new&#8221; and &#8220;unobvious&#8221; part of their idea&#8217;s patentability.</p>
<p>I think he was being slightly sarcastic.</p>
<p>Thank you.  It&#8217;s not like nine people on a jury could unanimously agree on such an abrd standard. He ibobviouslyvdidn&#8217;t see the Bloomberg interview. iously</p>
<p>Damn autocorrect !</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember the order of things. It really only matters which came first: the public knowledge of the idea (the release of the movie or video showing FingerWorks) or the filing of the patent by FingerWorks (if they ever filed a patent).</p>
<p>A close check on my Nexus 7 shows that two finger scrolling always zooms in applications with pinch to zoom (like Chrome) as well as scrolls, and that one finger scrolling works.</p>
<p>Nothing says that gesture operations for multiple fingers couldn&#8217;t be scrolling (pan) and zooming.</p>
<p>What Google claims and what the reality is are two very different things.</p>
<p>I agree with Zangestsu &#8211; a gesture simply means that it was triggered by more than one finger. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the resulting action can&#8217;t be scrolling.</p>
<blockquote>It was a master salesman at work — and his work seems to have been extremely effective.</blockquote>
<p>I miss him. But there will be someone in the future who is just as great. :)</p>
<p>I clearly remember that CNN&#8217;s John King used to use his both hands during 2004 Bush Vs Kerry election to  zoom the election maps on a huge Wall monitor. Some time it would not respond and he will give that  embarrassed look. I used to wonder who developed their software and on what OS it was running.</p>
<p>Call it what it is. Lazy journalism backed by a showman that was also a damn good liar (that liar being Steve Jobs). His ridiculous love letter book to his kids last yr (not sure what kind of father had to have a book written so his kids know him but oh well) was chock full of his lies &amp; half truths. His stage presentations were made to sell snake oil to the religious followers of Apple. The media bought it up &amp; recited it hook, line, &amp; sinker. Thankfully we are starting to see some truths be revealed about the &#8216;reality distortion field.&#8217;</p>

<p>Apple definitely has a patent on some pinch-to-zoom features: <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7" target="_blank">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7</a>,812,826</p>
<p>It just wasn&#8217;t a part of this trial.</p>
<p>Link fix: <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7,812,826" target="new">http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7,812,826</a></p>
<p>I linked to &#8216;826 in the piece  &#8212; I think it&#8217;s pretty narrow. You&#8217;ve got to do a gesture and then repeat the gesture within a predefined amount of time. Read the claims, don&#8217;t look at the drawings.</p>
<p>I would bet there&#8217;s a reason Apple hasn&#8217;t asserted it against anyone in two years &#8212; they know it&#8217;s not a winner.</p>
<p>APPLE DID NOT CREATE PINCH-TO-ZOOM!!!</p>
<p>There is prior art that should invalidate any patent by them.</p>
<p>Yes they did, just not multitouch, or the capacitive touch screen.</p>
<p>There is prior art, no they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Microsoft demo the Microsoft Surface Coffee Table like way back in 2007? And that had pinch-to-zoom.</p>
<p>2007 definitely wouldn&#8217;t represent prior art.</p>
<p>DiamondTouch in 2001 is</p>
<p>It would if it practiced the patent.</p>
<p>Except we are discussing that Apple did not invent it, not who patented it first with whichever wording you may want to hide behind. The multitouch finger gesture itself is unchanged.</p>
<p>Huh?  This sub-thread is clearly talking about the patent.</p>
<p>First to patent legislation wasn&#8217;t passed until recently. Ignoring the fact that it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s dumbest legislation, prior art would invalidate the patent in this case.</p>
<p>Totally depends on what standard any jury decides to apply to prior art.  Salesmanship is important.</p>
<p>First to invent actually makes it harder to find clearly invalidating prior art than first to file.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that just shows they didn&#8217;t invent it.</p>
<p>Huh?  The iPhone was sold in 2007. 2007 doesn&#8217;t show anything.</p>
<p>The point of the argument was that JohnZabbaMcLean&#8217;s said Apple invented pinch-to-zoom.</p>
<p>They created the version that Samsung used apparently.</p>
<p>Wording it is not creating it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re missing the point &#8211; the prior art samsung found doesn&#8217;t do the same thing &#8211; if it did it would then they would indeed have succeeded in overturning Apple&#8217;s patents.</p>
<p>Apple never claimed to have patented pinch to zoom.  They claimed to have patented what Samsung was doing, and they won on that claim.</p>
<p>Fine, I&#8217;ll be willing to agree to your very rigid point if you tell me which part of pinch to zoom we cannot see in all those old videos of previous technology.</p>
<p>As far as I can see the diamond touch was pinch to resize window, not pinch to zoom.  Yes that&#8217;s a multi-touch gesture, it&#8217;s just what Apple do or what Samsung do, or what anybody would actually want on a touch device.</p>
<p><strong>not</strong> what Apple do &#8211; getting late here.</p>
<p>Ok, but even if the resizing of any other object other than a picture or website is not specific enough for you the world still saw Jeff Han doing it first with pictures, canvas, maps, etc, with the same gestures. And even Jeff Han said how this was very scalable technology and that it would change the way we interacted with computers. He also mentioned how it was nothing new. Han was more humble than Apple.</p>
<p>The patent speaks of &#8220;scaling the view associated with the event object&#8221;. Scaling the view of a window should satisfy that.</p>
<p>But resizing a window or other object is not the same as scaling. You could also be cropping or reflowing (e.g. resizing on Windows or Mac OS X).</p>
<p>And wordplay makes it ok to steal credit for the work of many researchers that unlike Apple gave ideas to the world so we could all benefit?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not wordplay.  Resizing a window is not the same as pinch to zoom though they may seem similar in the background different things happen.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the patent does it say &#8220;pinch to zoom&#8221;. Again, it says "scaling the view associated with the event object".</p>
<p>Zooming in on for instance a photo is obviously called &#8220;scaling&#8221; by the patent. So why is zooming in on a window any different?</p>
<p>In both cases the view of an object is scaled by the use of multiple touch inputs.</p>
<p>No &#8211; in one instance you scale the view, while it remains the same size.<br />
In the other you resize the view and (potentially) scale the contents along with it.</p>
<p>They are exceedingly different.</p>
<p>Yes, but from this prior art would you then say that someone versed or skilled in the art of the industry wouldn&#8217;t be able to &#8220;obviously&#8221; come up with pinch to zoom, as applied in your context?</p>
<p>What Airwolf&#8217;s saying is that calling it &#8220;Pinch-to-zoom&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean they created it. Regardless of what version they used, they didn&#8217;t invent or create it.</p>
<p>Just like calling 260 ppi Retina Display didn&#8217;t mean they just made something totally new.</p>
<p>Retina Display isn&#8217;t an invention &#8211; it is a new term they defined to explain the advantages of high ppi.</p>
<p>They never called &#8216;260 ppi&#8217; a Retina Display, either. It&#8217;s only a &#8216;Retina Display&#8217; when on a device which is held at least a specific distance away.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a marketing term, not an invention, as Chen said.</p>
<p>As NetMage* said.</p>
<p>No&#8230; Apple did not by any stretch of the imagination invent pinch-to-zoom as a touch gesture.  Not even close&#8230; the first public demonstration of pinch-to-zoom on a touch device that I am aware of was in 1983&#8230; yes &#8216;83.  University of Toronto was working on multitouch implementations in 1984, and one of their researchers referenced the work of Myron Krueger&#8217;s Video Desk work from 1983, which created a lot of the basic multitouch gestures for use with computing systems.  You need to educate yourself:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html" target="_blank">http://www.billbuxton.com/multitouchOverview.html</a></p>
<p>There is even video from 1988:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmmxVA5xhuo" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmmxVA5xhuo</a></p>
<p>Apple had <strong>nothing </strong>to do with any of that multitouch research.</p>
<p>Ya know people are getting bogged down by &#8220;creating pinch to zoom&#8221;.  You have to look at what was actually patented not &#8220;pinch to zoom exists&#8221; because that does not matter.  What matters is the patent as it stands which has a specific implementation which is what Samsung infringed on.</p>
<p>Exactly. Apple hasn&#8217;t patented a concept. It&#8217;s patented their specific implementation of said concept. And they are very different things.</p>
<p>Your are arguing against a point no one is making.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinch to zoom&#8221; is nothing &#8211; look at the scores of vociferous imbeciles who believe Apple has patented the rectangle.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to be lawyer to understand patents. You do need to be an attorney to screw up a patent case.</p>
<p>I think Samsung has a solid patent for sit &#8216;n&#8217; spin, &#8216;cause they&#8217;re the only ones doing it.</p>
<p>Well written article. Good Job Nilay!</p>
<p>I think I actually prefer double tapping to zoom</p>
<p>Me too, and Android does that (or at least maps and gallery do).</p>
<p>The problem is zooming out then though. Either &#8220;reverse-pinch&#8221; to zoom out or double tap with two fingers. neither can be done with single handed use.</p>
<p>What? You can zoom out by double tapping again with one finger. What are you talking about?</p>
<p>I mean maybe not jellybean, but was it the same in every other version of android?</p>
<p>I want to say one simple thing: keep on criticizing Apple in just the way you do, and condoning outright ripoffs with carefully-rehearsed &#8220;talking points&#8221; about dictatorial Apple trying to copyright the basic, obvious &#8220;standard&#8221; interpretations. What the Apple case is about the the ability of a company to take the forward position in the market, innovating, and owning their inventions for a term. Shorter terms, yes, maybe more carefully vetted, yes; but I&#8217;m in favor of this protection. It&#8217;s largely the way that American industry operates. If I invested x dollars in a new, and well, we think it&#8217;s an innovative product, a new platform as it were, that sells a billion and changes the phone business entirely, then I think the various parts of what you do, the method you do them with, rather, make sense as a patent. Samsung and all world companies owe us some work to differentiate themselves. The PC model &#8220;won,&#8221; it&#8217;s true, but it doesn&#8217;t have to. We can all make stuff that interfaces with public and private networks and we call a phone. I think we need a better platform or platforms. We can see a massive evolution coming in computing, and the iPad is part of it. Is the PC? Do we need umpteen companies, all in Asia, competing for crumbs so imitation is part of the company from the postwar beginning? The dive to the bottom? I think what Nilay is arguing is that the patent laws are there. Change them if you want, but they do some good in real business terms. I think I want companies to be spending money trying to be original. Getting a PC at depressed world prices? Not so much.</p>
<p>Not everyone likes to think like a businessman as Apple is doing here. They didn&#8217;t innovate anything, they just patented it with a mindset of earning more profit from it. What other reason is there for a company to patent something? Some of us are engineers, scientists, or even dreamers who would like to see the technology of the &#8220;future&#8221; as we&#8217;ve been previewed when we&#8217;re little reading science fiction or watching movies. Apple is preventing all that from happening because they want more money. So competing companies have to waste time building a workaround for something that&#8217;s already been done rather than spending that time to build and improve on something that&#8217;s already been done.</p>
<p>Science and technology is about moving forward as a society. Not about owning the rights to a business market. Apple is in it for the money, yet they&#8217;re telling their employees it&#8217;s not about the money but about what&#8217;s right from wrong. Shame on them.</p>
<p>To say they &#8217;didn&#8217;t innovate anything&#8217; when their device has unarguably completely revolutionised the industry, is a joke.</p>
<p>You can argue they didn&#8217;t invent the broad concepts, but they don&#8217;t claim to have. They patented the specific implementation they created for a smartphone &#8211; and that was certainly innovative. You seem to believe that what they created is somehow obvious, which is what so many idiots cling to after a patent has been filed and a product has become mainstream. None of the other phones being released at the time did this, for a reason &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t obvious to them.</p>
<p>You say science is about moving forward, but that&#8217;s exactly what would suffer in your simplistic view of the patent system. If nobody could prevent anyone else copying them &#8211; we&#8217;d live in a world of rip-offs where it no longer became worth it to create an innovate &#8211; people can just copy it the next day and you&#8217;re out of business.</p>
<p>If you want progress &#8211; the patent system is a necessary part of it, and you&#8217;re very small minded not to realise that.</p>
<p>an innovation*</p>
<p>Thomas Edison didn&#8217;t invent the light bulb, but the light bulbs his company made and sold revolutionized home lighting.  Henry Ford didn&#8217;t invent the assembly line, but the use of this technology by the company that still bears his name revolutionized the manufacturing of automobiles.</p>
<p>Being the one that revolutionized a certain market is no evidence of being the inventor.  More often than not, it&#8217;s not the ability to create new inventions but the ability to see how to properly use the pre-existing inventions to build something great that determines who succeeds and who fails.</p>
<p>And Apple has succeeded&#8230;and for that congratulate them&#8230;but for them to then turn around and try to get a monopoly on tech and ideas they did not invent?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s bullshit.</p>
<p>Did you somehow miss the fact that I used the word &#8216;innovate&#8217; in my comment, and not &#8216;invent&#8217; &#8211; as did the comment to which I replied.</p>
<p>To make it clear for you &#8211; the original comment stated:</p>
<p>&#8216;They didn’t innovate anything&#8217;</p>
<p>Learn the difference between inventing and innovating.</p>
<p>As far as invention itself goes, the light bulb and assembly line are both different, because the original invention is what was later copied. In Apples case, while the broad concept of say, &#8216;multi touch&#8217; existed, they INVENTED a specific implementation of that concept. And it is THAT invention which they have patented. Not the concept as a whole.</p>
<p>Apple used to be the good guys. Not anymore. It&#8217;s like if in Return of The Jedi, Luke Skywalker said &#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ll come over to the dark side. Where do I sign?&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple never were the good guys.</p>
<p>Yeah, damn Apple for defending their IP.</p>
<p>Yeah, and that poor good guy Samsung, all they wanted to do was steal all of Apple&#8217;s innovation and copy it in a shameless way, right down to the packaging.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t a nice guy catch a break?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure somebody in the comments have pointed this out already (no time to read them all) but the bullet points in the article is pretty much the most easiest and straightforward way to implement it.  The language obfuscates it to laymen (ie non-programmers) to make it sound like there are alternative methods, but don&#8217;t be fooled.</p>
<p>Two words:  Thank.  You.</p>
<p>&quot; A large part of it is because patents are hard for non-lawyers to read and understand&#8230;&quot; But easy for tech writers to understand &#8211; apparently. Let&#8217;s hear from some actual patent attorneys.</p>
<p>Does this shit really matter? At the end of the day, when SJ was demoing pinch to zoom onstage, it was the first time I&#8217;d seen anything like it in my life, same with most other people on the planet. The iPhone was the first consumer device to have that implementation.</p>
<p>Yeah it matters to those haters who think Apple is the most evil company to ever exist.</p>
<p>For average people, it doesn&#8217;t matter who was first, but rather who was first to make it popular. For the patent system, though, the most important is who made it first (even if no one bought the product).</p>
<p>The fact that you never kept up to date on new technologies is &#8220;shit that doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221; yes.</p>
<p>Jeff Han gave a demo in early 2006 of exactly the same &#8220;pinch-to-zoom&#8221; as is now implemented in Android. Apple employees were present at this demo and you are telling us that they invented the exact same thing just before going to that demo then waited for a year and only then filed for a patent. Really?</p>
<p>And then Apple has the gall asking 68% of the smartphone buyers for $7 per device sold for this patent (and the other two utility patents) which is obviously not &#8220;their IP&#8221;.</p>
<p>A demo is not a specific implementation.</p>
<p>Apple hasn&#8217;t patented a concept, which your story pertains to.</p>
<p>It has patents it&#8217;s own specific implementation of said concept, which is very different, and not in any way invalidated by someone doing the same thing in a completely different way.</p>
<p>The only point of the article in that the patent is not &#8220;Pinch-to-Zoom&#8221;. Did Jeff Han concept do one finger scroll two finger gesture?</p>
<p>Either way, the demo was to close to the filing date to qualify.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s all this prior art how come no one sued Apple when the iPhone came out?</p>
<p>Because nobody thought the iPhone was going to be a smash hit. They all laughed at Jobs. Who&#8217;s laughing now.</p>
<p>Prior art is not the same thing as a patent.</p>
<p>What i still cannot figure out about this patent is that since multi-touch means that you are already assuming that the underlying software is  capable of recognizing more than one simultaneous input .  So, if while scrolling you suddenly put down one more finger on the screen and start pinching the software should be able to do detect that by the very definition of multi-touch.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate the above statement with an example of diamond touch demoed in the case as prior art [ <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3240686/samsung-apple-patents-launchtile-diamondtouch-table" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3240686/samsung-apple-patents-launchtile-diamondtouch-table</a>] . If while scrolling a web page in a browser window on the diamond touch table a second person comes into the room and issues a pinch-to-zoom gesture within the same browser window . what happens then? If the diamond touch started zooming while still scrolling this would have demonstrated prior-art and invalidated this patent.</p>

<p>Nilay,</p>
<p>Can you please get hold of this diamond touch table and check how this scenario works on it. You could invalidate the patent and receive the &#8216;PATENT PEACE PRICE&#8217;</p>
<p><img src="http://moopz.com/assets_c/2012/08/diamondtouch_table_640_large-cropped-thumb-620x300-188169.jpg" /></p>
<p>I meant to say &#8216;PATENT PEACE PRIZE&#8217; [awarded to those individuals for their brave efforts to peacefully end patent disputes]</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you tell just by the picture how differently this device works?</p>
<p>You can actually about how the Diamond touch table works in the product page. It has radio devices, it&#8217;s pretty complicated, and although it seems the same, it&#8217;s completly diferent.</p>
<p>That is not necessarily the distinction here.</p>
<p>For example in Claim, Apple states having an interface which distinguished between single touch and multi touch, such that they lead to different behaviors.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why they were so specific about this, and it MIGHT be because they knew they couldn&#8217;t patent ALL multitouch, but they did come up with their specific implementation with certain arguably novel behaviors. Its THOSE behaviors that they argue Samsung has infringed.</p>
<p>Please read Apple patent 7844915, it&#8217;s a bit different than I think you believe it to be.</p>
<p>Same case, same lawyers, same arguments, if filed in South Korea Samsung wins&#8230; Jury bias.</p>
<p>Think US is the ONLY nation where patents cases are determined by jurors, aka average joe/jane off street.</p>
<p>Days before the decision was announced in US, a judge in S Korea ruled against both Apple and Samsung, giving both partial victory.</p>
<p>No, Samsung didn&#8217;t &#8216;win&#8217; in South Korea, they were found to be infringing there, too.</p>
<p>The only difference was that in South Korea Apple was also found to be infringing some of Samsung&#8217;s patents. The damages were also significantly lower.</p>
<p>And by the way, how can you refer to the South Korea case in order to prove that a US case was bias over territory?</p>
<p>How is it that the case in South Korea wasn&#8217;t biased?</p>
<p>Because Android won, so it&#8217;s ok. Alsup/Posner rule, Koh was bought.</p>
<p>Oracle tried to copyright APIs&#8230;anyone with a brain should be happy as hell they lost.</p>
<p>why does everyone on here keep saying android is only owned by Google and only developed by Google. last time i check it was a joint effort by 10+ companies</p>
<p>It is because Google develops the software on their own and decides which features and APIs go into a release and only they have the final say on this. But once the new version is released anybody can use it and maybe even contribute patches and Google can then decide if they want to accept the patch into main branch.</p>
<p>Samsung may have a lot going for them during the upcoming Dec 6 appeal. The fact that the jury arrived at the verdict in almost record time (~20 hours) in such a complex case is one strong factor. Samsung would definitely raise this issue during the appeal. One reason for such a quick deliberations period can be attributed to the jury&#8217;s disregard of Samsung&#8217;s prior art argument, a strong argument, IMO; one source I read said that the jury did not properly follow the judge&#8217;s instructions on how to arrive at a verdict (<a href="http://goo.gl/yzjfE)" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/yzjfE)</a> . My belief on how likely the verdict would be overturned is confirmed by this article. Everyone, keeping supporting the free-source Android. I respect Apple, yet I will never buy an iDevice as a result of this verdict.</p>
<p>*keep</p>
<p>Why do you think that Android is somehow &#8216;pure&#8217; or &#8216;good&#8217; just because it&#8217;s open source.</p>
<p>The only reason Google open sourced Android was that if they didn&#8217;t, they&#8217;d have to pay the royalties to Microsoft (and now Apple) that they lumped on the unfortunate manufacturers who carry that burden (along with the legal cases).</p>
<p>It makes absolutely no difference to the end user whether or not the OS is open source or not, and of itself it offers basically no practical benefits.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a source- that a terrible bit of journamalism. Moreover, the only real point they make is that <strong>groklaw</strong> questions the verdict. Left unsaid is that a writer at groklaw, a paralegal, didn&#8217;t like the verdict.</p>
<p>The amount of time that jury spent in reaching their verdict is not an appellate issue.</p>
<p>The comments made by the jury after the verdict is not an appellate issue, unless those comments indicate that there were extrinsic factors (bribery, extortion, jury tampering) brought to bear on the jury.</p>
<p>It must be evident on the face of the verdict. The question for an appellate court is no longer why this jury reached this verdict, but whether any reasonable jury could have possibly reached the conclusions reached by this jury, given the record.</p>
<p>December 6 isn&#8217;t the appeal&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad Apple didn&#8217;t invent the steering wheel or joystick, or we&#8217;d all wouldn&#8217;t be able to drive.</p>
<p>Oh wow. I would&#8217;ve never guessed that The Verge would go on an anti-Apple rant. Incredible.</p>
<p>This article is flawed from the start. First, it hinges its main point on an unproven hypothetical: did Samsung&#8217;s implementation of pinch-and-zoom infringe on Apple&#8217;s patents? Nilay himself states &#8220;it likely doesn&#8217;t&#8221;, likely?? He didn&#8217;t say &#8220;it does not.&#8221; Big difference there. The assumption is based entirely on that unproven hypothetical.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Samsung] tried to show their accused devices scrolling with two fingers on the screen. Two finger scrolling is beyond the claims of the &#8216;915 patent, so any device that implements it likely doesn&#8217;t infringe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be clear, Apple does have a patent on a specific, limited pinch-to-zoom implementation&#8230;&#8221;<br />
What happens if Apple actually did prove infringement??</p>
<p>Second, this article is making the insinuation that Apple is making a blanket statement on pinch-to-zoom. Even despite delineating the exact Apple patent on their unique pinch-to-zoom method. The article fails to present any evidence of such blanket statements by Apple, yet insists that is their intent. When has Apple ever said they own anything and everything on pinch-to-zoom? Never. Only methods can be patented, not ideas. And Apple did patent a pinch-to-zoom method; that is their claim. This aura of pinch-to-zoom is attributed by third parties to Apple, not pushed by Apple itself, despite what this article is forcefully trying on insisting.</p>
<p>Third, the article drags Apple through the coals while giving a pass to the sheer ineptitude of the Samsung lawyers at being incapable of understanding, much less defending their points. This is the only mention in the article:</p>
<p>&quot; for Samsung, the lawyers got caught in a bit of deception while trying to show off two-finger scrolling — they were pinching and zooming at the same time. Oops.&quot;</p>
<p>Really? How about talking more about their tactics to misguide and willfully deceive the jury? So going back to that hypothetical of wether Samsung infringed or not. It was up to Samsung and their lawyers to prove it. They failed. Looks like Apple did prove infringement after all.</p>
<p>If Apple owns their method for pinch-to-zoom, then why can I do the same exact gesture on my Windows Phone?</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s a different method?</p>
<p>Or because Microsoft and Apple have a cross licensing agreement?</p>
<p>Apple acquired most of their multitouch patents from the acquisition of Fingerworks in 2005. Founded by John Elias and Wayne Westerman of the University of Delaware in 1998. The owners of Fingerworks became Apple employees and continue filing patents in Apples name.<br />
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/22/some-iphone-touchscreen-roots-splained-by-fingerworks-inventors/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/22/some-iphone-touchscreen-roots-splained-by-fingerworks-inventors/</a><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FingerWorks" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FingerWorks</a></p>
<p>That makes a compelling case in Apple&#8217;s favour.</p>
<p>If they acquire the company with original patents, they own those patents and all of the rights thereof.</p>
<p>Then why has the Gmail Android app never had pinch-to-zoom?</p>
<p>isn&#8217;t it actually unpinch-to-zoom? but I guess it didn&#8217;t sound cool enough for Apple.</p>
<p>Touchscreens have been invented @ CERN.</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/uk/4/42/CERN_logo_400x400.gif" /></p>
<p>I call BS. Apple clearly invented, &amp; patented this technology. This is why there are laws in the US about plagiarism &amp; intellectual properties. Because companies like Google take advantage of the law &amp; duplicate the technology as close as possible. It&#8217;s wrong. Wouldn&#8217;t you be upset if you worked 3 days straight on a project to make it perfect, &amp; then someone copies it almost completely &amp; gets an A+, without doing ANY of the work. That&#8217;s wrong, right? But they got away with it, because it&#8217;s not EXACTLY the same. Sorry to be such a troll with this, but i am working in an AT&amp;T SSG as a telesales agent &amp; this thing is all over the place. It&#8217;s not the first time apple was infringed, a year ago, Apple sued google for using certain lines of code that where IDENTICAL to the software used in Iphones &amp; ipods. They clearly stole it, so apple sued, &amp; won. I don&#8217;t know why everyone is so upset at apple, maybe it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re right* after all, i know people hate it when I am right :P</p>
<p>If they are so valid why did the exact same patents get thrown out by a judge in the UK? And all the other cases Apple is losing elsewhere in the world on these patents?</p>
<p>This stuff is far too complex for a layman jury to fully understand, should be a judge who rules on this stuff who has the time, the brain power, and the legal knowledge to be able to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>If they are so invalid, why was Samsung found guilty of infringement in a far more in-depth trial in the US? And why did various other countries find Samsung guilty (including in Korea) and/or ban their products such as the Galaxy Tab?</p>
<p>The whole point of juries, by the way, is that they don&#8217;t have to have legal knowledge to make the decision. They are directed with very simple instructions to answer matters of fact. The judge then applies these facts (decisions from the jury) to the law.</p>
<p>Please explain how the &#8220;exact same patents&#8221; were thrown out by a judge. Refer to the specific patent numbers.</p>
<p>FWIW I personally think Samsung copied Apples iPhone 3 hardware design and icons on the Galaxy S, but thats about it. The phones that came after the original S had moved on and don&#8217;t compare. So they should get a significant rap on the knuckles for this.</p>
<p>But these patents are mostly BS either due to prior art or being far too broad &#8211; a patent for a black rectangle with round squares for the front of a phone? For f@#ks sake&#8230;.</p>
<p>People who believe any of the patents for for &#8216;a black rectangle with round squares&#8217; are the true idiots, in all of this.</p>
<p>are for*</p>
<p>Apple did not invent multi-touch and they only have a limited patent covering a specific implementation of pinch/stretch to unzoom/zoom. And yes, the patent system works that way: if it&#8217;s not exactly the same, then it&#8217;s different.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re confusing Apple with Oracle in their lawsuit against Google for alleged infringement on copyrighted code. That case is now over in favor of Google.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t have patent law that &#8216;generally&#8217; covers an idea, it leaves way too much to interpretation. That&#8217;s why patents have to be very specific.</p>
<p>It is a given that a company will try to write a patent as all-encompassing as they think they can get away with it.</p>
<p>The problem as usual is prior art exists for this as well &#8211; Perceptive Pixel had a very popular demo on You Tube from before the iPhone showing off pinch to zoom on a maps demo. Perceptive Pixel was spun off from M.I.T and was recently bought by Microsoft &#8211; PRIOR ART is supposed to invalidate a patent but prior art doesn&#8217;t matter when you have the kind of money Apple does.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that in nearly every other country except the US, Apple has lost &#8211; in the UK the terms of Samsung&#8217;s win means that Apple has to print on it&#8217;s website that Samsung did not copy Apple.<br />
This mainly down to the fact that software patents do not exist in Europe &#8211; Why should they nearly everything Apple has done with touch tech is a reproduction of a physical action &#8211; like slide to unlock &#8211; which is an exact copy of how every laptop&#8217;s screen lock has worked for years. Apple could have sued over Samsungs iPhone-knock off style under copyright law but this patent nonsense is just ridiculous.</p>
<blockquote> Why should they nearly everything Apple has done with touch tech is a reproduction of a physical action – like slide to unlock – which is an exact copy of how every laptop’s screen lock has worked for years.</blockquote>
<p>????</p>
<p>TELL ME GOOGLE PATENTED THEIR SUPERIOR VERSION OF IT.</p>
<p>Ok, the point is: Samsung&#8217;s lawyers are stupids and Nilay is a smart guy.</p>
<p>Why? He didn&#8217;t present a workaround.</p>
<p>I agree that Samsung&#8217;s attorneys are stupid and should be sued for malpractice.  However, Nilay is just a patent law attorney wannabe but never will be.</p>
<p>I was being ironic.</p>
<p>The article was well done. The comments are mostly the blind leading the blind.</p>
<p>Wow! It is good to have a lawyer on the team!!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;whereas Mobile Safari in iOS generally locks you to a one-dimensional scroll when you start moving with one finger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before you report on another iPhone feature please pick one up and actually use it. Safari (as well as many other apps for the iPhone) allow multi-directional scrolling with one finger.</p>
<p>I expect better from a tech blog, especially The Verge. I understand the argument but getting something this simple wrong demeans and cheapens the article.</p>
<p>Nilay woke up one day and thought: &#8220;Yes, I figured out how to workaround the patent&#8221;. After a few Twitter posts, he decides to make a &#8220;I&#8217;m so smart post&#8221; on The Verge.</p>
<p>Too bad the gets the facts wrong, and actually presents no workaround (like you pointed out, iOS has one finger multi-direction scrolling = panning).</p>
<p>Even sadder is watching all the people cheering, without actually knowing what they are cheering. It must have seemed pro-Google, so let the cheer begin.</p>
<p>So the ultimate irony of all of this, is perhaps that Nilay&#8217;s article title actually references itself as well???</p>
<p>I actually believe the actually problem is the reader. Looking at the comment I think most people didn&#8217;t even understand the article, so again that&#8217;s how myth spreads.</p>
<p>The first of the article is, let&#8217;s say, on topic He tries to debunk the myth that Apple has patented pinch-to-zoom and I think he succeds.</p>
<p>Problem is he then goes on some ego trip, saying the patent is easy to workaround which he fails to prove, and confuses people (which are lets face, easy to confuse).</p>
<p>I think the article is okay, it doesn&#8217;t actually claim that the verdict was RIGHT or WRONG. But because of this, everyone has run off and drawn their own conclusions. And then you have readers who didn&#8217;t read the entire article but start reading comments, and we&#8217;re off to the races.</p>
<p>I admit I had to go back and re-read, as I got thrown off by some of the comment threads.</p>
<p>One thing though- it doesn&#8217;t matter what the actual iOS behavior is, what matters is the patent and its specific claims.</p>
<p>You seem to hate me, which is cool. You&#8217;re allowed to hate me.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t hate the reporting. Mobile Safari in iOS locks into a one-dimensional scroll all the time. Try scrolling vertically on a page, and once the scroll starts, move your finger horizontally. It won&#8217;t pan because the scroll is locked.</p>
<p>Chrome on Jelly Bean always lets you pan.</p>
<p>The scrol isn&#8217;t locked, unless you start scrolling in a more or less vertical or horizontal direction. If you start by scrolling diagonally, then it never locks you (so it&#8217;s not quite &#8220;all the time&#8221;.)</p>
<blockquote> (so it’s not quite "all the time".)</blockquote>
<p>Exactly. I interpreted as one finger = vertical scroll, which is not the case. It only locks vertical scroll after a while.</p>
<p>Nilay actually seems to understand the fundamental behavior, we are just disagreeing about the term &#8220;all the time&#8221;. In his response to you above he says, &#8220;Try scrolling vertically on a page, and once the scroll starts, move your finger horizontally. It won’t pan because the scroll is locked.&#8221;</p>
<p>The simplest way of stating the difference between the platforms is that iOS will situationally lock your scrolling, Android does not at all.</p>
<p>(BTW- it will also lock horizontal scrolling. The &#8216;locking&#8217; occurs almost instantaneously in my experience, as long as you initially start scrolling in a near-horizontal or near-vertical manner.) The threshold is pretty big, trying it right now it seems around +/- 30 degrees to either side. On my 3GS I pretty much have to start scrolling immediately at 45 degrees to prevent the scroll locking (but it&#8217;s still not &#8220;all the time&#8221;.)</p>
<p>The point I&#8217;m making is that the claim states one finger scrolling, two finger gestures. Lock or no lock, one finger is still scrolling in iOS and Android. The fact that it is locked is irrelevant if you consider panning as scrolling.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid the claim is to consider that panning is NOT scrolling, which is not my interpretation. Scrolling considers all directions and is not defined by directional locks.</p>
<p>In fact, what iOS does or doesn&#8217;t is quite irrelevant.</p>
<p>I think your interpretation is valid, but not definitive.</p>
<p>I know, as I said in a lower post, what matters is the claim construction in the courtroom :)  There is no way to give a definitive answer.</p>
<p>One piece of information (although you&#8217;d have to dig further back than this) is this bit of testimony during the trial:</p>
<p>&#8220;Samsung pulled a similar trick when speaking to Karan Singh, a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto. Singh testified about the patents that cover the tap-to-zoom features and the ability to differentiate between single-finger scrolling and double-finger gestures. During cross-examination, Samsung&#8217;s attorney asked Singh if any Samsung devices could scroll using two fingers. Singh replied they did not.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3233870/samsung-mislead-jury-apple-patent-experts-trial/in/2971889" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3233870/samsung-mislead-jury-apple-patent-experts-trial/in/2971889</a></p>
<p>I mean given all this, the only way the patent claims or any of this makes sense is if scrolling and panning are considered different. Because Apple is basically making a claim to the behavior that one finger means 1 behavior (which they say is &#8220;scrolling&#8221;), and 2-finger means a different behavior (which they call &#8220;gestures&#8221; which should include panning as 1 possible gesture.)</p>
<p>I am imagining that this distinction is actually covered in the background section in the Apple patent, and how they reference it there is how it is basically defined for the rest of the patent. If they have decent patent lawyers (how could they not?), they would clarify this for sure.</p>
<blockquote>I mean given all this, the only way the patent claims or any of this makes sense is if scrolling and panning are considered different. </blockquote>
<p>Not really. What the lawyers argued was that gestures &lt;&gt; scrolling. If the phone two finger scrolled which is different then gesture, then it wouldn&#8217;t be infringed.</p>
<p>I looked up patent 7844915 &#8220;Application programming interfaces for scrolling operations&#8221;. Indeed in the background section it states &#8220;Scrolling is the act of sliding a directional (e.g., horizontal or vertical) presentation of content&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>So reading between the lines here. Android has no such scrolling behavior at all, which does neatly sidestep claim 8 of this patent.</p>
<p>Samsung enhanced their phones by utilizing the scrolling behavior in the patent, and thus are dinged in court.</p>
<p>What they TRIED to claim is that their devices have BOTH 1-finger and 2-finger scrolling, but it (probably) doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I would need to read more of the patent to be sure, but I&#8217;ve wasted enough time already!</p>
<blockquote>I looked up patent 7844915 "Application programming interfaces for scrolling operations". Indeed in the background section it states "Scrolling is the act of sliding a directional (e.g., horizontal or vertical) presentation of content…"</blockquote>
<p>e.g = For example. It doesn&#8217;t constrain it to vertical or vertical.</p>
<p>I give up! (not in trying to convince you, but in trying to make sense of this all.) The patent pages are always scanned and are hard to read&#8230;</p>
<p>We are all trying to make sense of it. :)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t hate you but I do think you and Josh are growing to much of an ego and it&#8217;s not good for this site.</p>
<p>Either way:<br />
<blockquote>But don’t hate the reporting. Mobile Safari in iOS locks into a one-dimensional scroll all the time. </blockquote><br />
It doesn&#8217;t. You made me get my iPhone4S out of the box, and it panns, not one finger vertical lock. The problem is you must be using mobile sites, which have no horizontal scroll. On non-mobile sites I can clearly on finger multi-directional pan (see <a href="http://www.publico.pt" target="_blank">www.publico.pt</a> for example).</p>
<p>Hope now you will see that I don&#8217;t really hate you, I just hate bad reporting.</p>
<p>Yes- it can lock you into one-dimensional scroll, but not all the time. It&#8217;s situational. Whereas Google NEVER locks you into one-dimensional scroll.</p>
<p>That being said, it may still be a very valid example of Google designing around an Apple patent.</p>
<blockquote>Yes- it can lock you into one-dimensional scroll, but not all the time. It’s situational.</blockquote>
<p>If it&#8217;s situational then the patent shouldn&#8217;t be infringed. If the scroll only locks after a second, and you consider that panning is not scrolling, then you get  one-finger panning today instead of the one-finger scroll with the claim states.</p>
<p>The point &#8220;it never locks&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t matter since there are situations where you get a one-finger pan.</p>
<p>Actually, I believe Nilay is correct but was not clear.</p>
<p>The Apple implementation will lock you to directional scrolling if that&#8217;s how you start (it&#8217;s basically anticipating that you are scrolling say up or down a page of text and don&#8217;t want to move side to side.) If you tap and start scrolling diagonally, it will let you do that.</p>
<p>Nilay says that Android gets around an Apple patent on this by not limiting scrolling direction AT ALL. That&#8217;s the distinction.</p>
<blockquote>Nilay says that Android gets around an Apple patent on this by not limiting scrolling direction AT ALL. That’s the distinction.</blockquote>
<p>But the claim says nothing about the limitation of scroll direction. That&#8217;s my point. <br />
Even if you don&#8217;t lock, it&#8217;s still scrolling.</p>
<p>I bet the key is the difference between scrolling (unidirectional) and panning (bidirectional). If Android always pans, then there is no scroll operation.</p>
<p>There are several definitions on the web for scrolling. For example this one does not constrain scroll to vertical or horizontal <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/scroll" target="_blank">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/scroll</a> or this one <a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/scroll" target="_blank">http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/scroll</a></p>
<p>According to these definitions, it doesn&#8217;t matter if the scrolling is diagonal. It&#8217;s still scrolling. There are other definitions which only talk about vertical and horizontal.</p>
<p>From the Oxford dictionary you linked to<br />
<blockquote>move displayed text or graphics in a particular direction on a computer screen in order to view different parts of them:</blockquote></p>
<p>The &#8220;in a particular direction&#8221; means unidirectional, rather than bidirectional. The other definition says move &#8220;across&#8221;, which seems like a single direction.</p>
<p>So the possible scenario here is that scrolling means any sort of locking, regardless of direction. It just so happens that Apple does up/down and left/right.</p>
<p>Or no lock whatsoever. When you pan you are actually moving the screen in finite unidirectional segments. I know this seems like lawyer talk, but formalism aside, I actually think that moving the screen is scrolling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to the courts (again) my friends.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about interpretation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one more tidbit from the Apple patent:<br />
&#8220;At least certain embodiments of the presnt disclosure include scrolling operations for scrolling a display of a device. The scrolling operations include bouncing a scrolled region&#8230;, rubber banding a scrolled region&#8230;, and setting a scrolling angle that locks the scroll in a horizontal or vertical direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said previously I am wasting time on this, but actually this is enlightening in terms of studying patents (which I am involved in from time to time.)</p>
<blockquote>and setting a scrolling angle that locks the scroll in a horizontal or vertical direction</blockquote>
<p>So if it &#8220;locks on one of those directions&#8221; then it means that any other direction would still be a scroll ;) If it hasn&#8217;t so, they would just say &#8220;lock into a scroll&#8221;, the vertical/horizontal wouldn&#8217;t be necessary.</p>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;re right. But its that very act of &#8216;locking&#8217; which is relevant and characteristic of a scroll, not whether it&#8217;s horizontal or vertical. It just so happens that those are the directions that are useful, and thus are how Apple and apparently Samsung implemented locking (and therefore &#8216;scrolling&#8217;) in their devices.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not mad at all, it&#8217;s nice to discuss the actual patents in a patent case, not all the other sideshow stuff.</p>
<blockquote>But its that very act of ‘locking’ which is relevant and characteristic of a scroll,</blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t know about that. And for the record, Samsung implementation of the lock is pretty lame.</p>
<p>Actually Google since I&#8217;m running CM9&#8230;.</p>
<p>So does that have locking at all? (one finger or two finger)</p>
<p>With one finger it locks, but it&#8217;s much milder lock. It quickly unlocks, and it a bit more erratic (doesn&#8217;t always work).</p>
<p>Is it really locking, or is it simply not capable of discriminating between very small differences in angle? I think I do see what you mean, but the software may not actually be trying to lock.</p>
<p>Hard to tell, but I think it tries to lock since I tried with a very large angle, and the Galaxy Note screen is huge.</p>
<p>With two fingers it&#8217;s complicated since it starts to zoom. It&#8217;s inconclusive :)</p>
<p>Even if their implementation is crappy, it can still infringe upon the patent. Although that&#8217;s more a reason to just not have it&#8230;</p>
<p>Two-finger &#8216;non-scrolling&#8217; seems to bear out in actuality in iOS. If you use 2 fingers on a web page, you never get scroll locking. Whereas with one-finger, you get scroll locking if you start by moving up/down or left/right. I think Apple filed this patent, and then later refined the actual iOS behavior to only selectively apply scroll locking to one-finger behavior. But that it discriminates at all is the critical issue of that particular part of claim 8.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Nilay&#8217;s article is pro-Apple or pro-Samsung. If anything, it splashed water on the opinion pieces that Apple has cornered the market on anything. The easy way out of the patent is pretty clearly explained here, it seems Samsung wanted to have their cake and eat it too. Although I like scrolling (locking), not having it is not that big of a deal and really not worth copying and risking a patent infringement.</p>
<blockquote>I don’t think Nilay’s article is pro-Apple or pro-Samsung.</blockquote>
<p>Neither do I. I never said he was biased. I know in the kinds of &#8220;battle&#8221; people always assume someone is on one of the sides.</p>
<p>I have Galaxy Note and an iPhone, but I sided with able in this situation since I think the Galaxy S was a blatant copy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t even know how big the ramifications of this case are (which everyone was saying was way bigger than the actual award amount.) I also think the Galaxy S was a pretty blatant copy which justified the lawsuit, but Samsung by now has more or less evolved its own design language which is different from Apple. And apparently most of these software patents can be designed around anyway.</p>
<blockquote>And apparently most of these software patents can be designed around anyway.</blockquote>
<p>When they actually try. Android unlock is now much better for it. And I do think the first part of this article if pretty important to clarify that Apple didn&#8217;t patent &#8220;rectangles&#8221;, &#8220;pinch-to-zoom&#8221; or &#8220;grid of icons&#8221;.</p>
<p>Patents are much more complex and detailed (in diferent ways, but design patents are also explicit). The problem is most people then even interpret the article, and commented like this was some sort of &#8220;Apple&#8217;s patent is invalid&#8221; story.</p>
<p>A clear example is Google Now vs S-Voice. S-Voice is a blatant copy of Siri which probably infringes a lot of stuff, while Google Now truly innovated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad we actually went through this exercise. It actually wasn&#8217;t that hard, once I realized I had to ignore all the hooplah and just RTFP (with a little assistance from RTFA).</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be mad, I&#8217;m playing your devil&#8217;s advocate :P</p>
<p>Yes.  But couldn&#8217;t scolling be construed to mean up and down only? A quick google for definition of scrolling- &#8220;The action of moving displayed text or graphics up or down on a computer screen in order to view different parts of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the scenario that I think is possible. The patent (and not iOS) makes a claim on determining a single-finger as a &#8216;scroll&#8217; and two-fingers as a &#8216;gesture&#8217;. You&#8217;re right- the actual iOS implentation is different. But if scrolling can be argued by Google to basically mean &#8216;up and down&#8217;, then by having one-finger do panning in all directions is their way of saying, &#8220;Look, our behavior is different.&#8221;</p>
<p>What this has to do with those Samsung specific devices, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>This must be it. For a scroll operation, you don&#8217;t want motion in the perpendicular direction, so panning probably cannot be construed as scrolling since it allows motion in all directions.</p>
<p>The actual Apple patent refers to scrolling as horizontal or vertical, so I think that is the actual distinction here. Android has no scrolling at all which avoids the patent. Samsung apparently does have 1 finger scrolling. They tried to claim it has 2-finger scrolling as well (which would clear them of the patent), but apparently they failed to show this.</p>
<blockquote>Yes. But couldn’t scolling be construed to mean up and down only? A quick google for definition of scrolling- "The action of moving displayed text or graphics up or down on a computer screen in order to view different parts of them."</blockquote>
<p>It depends on the interpretation. If you define scrolling as purely vertical and horizontal then yes, if you don&#8217;t then it&#8217;s irrelevant. Again, it&#8217;s up to the courts.</p>
<p>This may or may not be enough to overturn during appeal. While I appreciate Nilay&#8217;s piece, I think the reality is that this will end up on the cutting room floor of the people who write the history books for this landmark case. What I mean is that a decision has been made, the jury has spoken and this is too fine a detail to create a meaningful change in direction.</p>
<p>Nilay said Samsung &#8220;tried&#8221; to show they did not infringe upon Patent 7,844,915. If you read the referring link to this (another verge article), it appears they tried and failed. Worst of all they tried to pass it off as otherwise.</p>
<p>If anything, Nilay is saying it should have been easy for Samsung to design around the patent (which Google has done), but they apparently didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Does anybody ever remark that Pinch to Zoom is awkward and stupid?  Like asking Siri if it&#8217;s raining outside, or holding a phone in front of your face to tell you that you&#8217;re looking at a Starbucks, or using an awkward QR reader on a gallon of milk.</p>
<p>Pinch to shrink sucks.  Spread to zoom sucks.</p>
<p>full disclosure: i&#8217;m stupid.</p>
<p>now that&#8217;s out of the way, i&#8217;d like to ask a simple question:</p>
<p>did samsung infringe on this patent on any of the phones in the trial?</p>
<p>if they did, were they not rightfully penalised? i know nilay&#8217;s article here is about clarifying the scope of the patent in question, but why are some commenters talking about over-turning the verdict. not ALL phones infringed, only some did &#8212; which proves the jury were switched on enough to do a phone-by-phone check of the patent in question&#8230;</p>
<p>also, why were samsung stupid enough to have varying implementations of pinch-to-zoom if some phones infringed on the patent and some didn&#8217;t? why didn&#8217;t they just used the one that didn&#8217;t infringe. better yet why didn&#8217;t they use google&#8217;s?</p>
<p>It appears they did. They tried to claim they didn&#8217;t, but the video they showed to &#8216;prove&#8217; their claim actually demonstrated otherwise. Read this article (which Nilay links to):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3233870/samsung-mislead-jury-apple-patent-experts-trial/in/2971889" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3233870/samsung-mislead-jury-apple-patent-experts-trial/in/2971889</a></p>
<p>Well, the Apple worshipping tech media certainly were all too willing to push this meme without doing any &#8220;journalism&#8221; themselves to find out just what was patented and what wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great that there are ways to work around the patent, but that doesn&#8217;t change my opinion that it shouldn&#8217;t be patentable in the first place.</p>
<p>What ways?</p>
<p>Okay, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. But the gist of what Nilay is saying:</p>
<p>1. There&#8217;s a lot of misinformation in the press about these patents.<br />
2. The jury ruled that 21 of 24 accused Samsung phones infringed claim 8 of Apple patent 7,844,915<br />
3. It&#8217;s actually pretty easy to design around claim 8 of Apple patent 7,844,915, as well as other Apple patents.<br />
4. Samsung tried to show their accused devices scrolling with two fingers on the screen. Two finger scrolling is beyond the claims of the &#8216;915 patent, so any device that implements it likely doesn&#8217;t infringe.</p>
<p>So the 21 out of 24 Samsung devices- I guess they DO feature 2-finger scrolling? Or don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>If they do, then the title (and thrust) of the article should not be &#8220;how a confused media gave Apple something it doesn&#8217;t own&#8221;, it should be &#8220;how a confused jury gave Apple something it doesn&#8217;t own.&#8221; How it is being misinterpreted in the press is much less relevant than how the jury interprets or misinterprets the patent (and whether Samsung did design around it.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also the trade dress issue, they could&#8217;ve still lost on that. But just trying to be sure about this patent.</p>
<p>Okay, reading the link Nilay posted about Samsung &#8220;trying to show&#8221; their accused devices scrolling with two fingers on the screen:<br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3233870/samsung-mislead-jury-apple-patent-experts-trial/in/2971889" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3233870/samsung-mislead-jury-apple-patent-experts-trial/in/2971889</a><br />
The article basically says Samsung failed in their attempt, as the video testimony actually showed pinch and zoom and not 2-finger scrolling. So either these 21 Samsung devices don&#8217;t feature 2-finger scrolling (and thus possibly infringes upon Patent 7,844,915), or Samsung really flat out screwed up big time.<br />
According to the testimony of Karan Singh, a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto, the Samsung devices do NOT have 2-finger scrolling. Can someone pull out a Galaxy 1 (or any of the 21 infringing devices) and confirm this?</p>
<p>I would say the article title should be:</p>
<p>&#8220;How a confused pack of Apple-haters wrongly concluded that the jury gave Apple something Apple never claimed to own.&#8221;</p>
<p>A good analogy is that while tire-makers do not patent the roundness of their tires, they DO all patent their tread designs. And those patents are upheld and enforced with respect to the way they make their tire grip the road under various surface and weather conditions.</p>
<p>Apple had a perfect right to patent the code by which THEY implement pinch-to-zoom. Let others implement it in their own way, and also choose they own look and feel without copying Apple&#8217;s look.</p>
<p>Well, they did. Samsung did NOT copy Apple&#8217;s code, they just solved some problems that Apple also solved. So single-touch and multi-touch gestures cannot be patented, but an interface with both single and multi-touch gestures (which, of course entails some system of discriminating between the two) is somehow a great innovation that should be protected? &#8220;Pull the other one&#8221;, as they say.</p>
<p>PEOPLE OF THE INTERNET- Apple does NOT have a patent on MULTITOUCH- THAT IS IN FACT THE EXACT POINT NILAY IS MAKING HERE. Apple&#8217;s patent covers certain ASPECTS of THEIR IMPLEMENTATION of a multitouch screen, the relevant one here being the interface discriminating between single touch and multi touch, and assigning different responses to each.</p>
<p>Even Google states it as such (again RTFA): <blockquote>according to a Google spokesperson, &#8220;Apple&#8217;s &#8217;915 patent claims a very specific software implementation, and the implementation is different in Jelly Bean.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p>Whether you think Apple&#8217;s specific claims are valid or patentable is a different issue. But please, no more photos of multitouch screens of the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve saying the behavior of Apple, and many Apple&#8217;s fan here all says the same thing: &#8220;Apple ever has the saint and pure at the trial&#8221;. But now?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;did Apple patent scrolling?</p>
<p>Why not let the public decided what to do with these stupid patents since they are one&#8217;s that keep these companies afloat. And why do they need to keep the patents on such strict leases. Whats all of this worth in such a delicate country.</p>
<p>Karma is a b^tch and apple is gonna find out for themselves pretty soon. I want to know what new technology they&#8217;re going to put on newer iPhones when they can&#8217;t add patented features.</p>
<p>What will it take for this stupid patent system to blow-up. Please explain to me how locking scroll to a unique direction once detected can be patented. there&#8217;s no invention or technical innovation behind this. Apple should have patented color vision and sue anyone who actually sees colors !</p>
<p>You are entirely correct. The idea is simple. Implementing and fine-tuning it takes some work, but everybody has to do that for themselves, so your hard work is not directly coppied. Patents like this should NOT exist.</p>
<p>Yup, that&#8217;s alll Jobs was. A sales man.</p>
<p>&#8220;patents are hard for non-lawyers to read and understand, and it&#8217;s far easier to use a shorthand that obscures important details. &quot;</p>
<p>This is the most salient point i&#8217;ve read regarding intellectual property law on a tech blog. Tech blogs are innundated with bad information when it comes to copyright law, trademark law, and patent law, both in the articles and even worse the comment section. People not only don&#8217;t know the law but don&#8217;t know the foundation of the law and with respect to patents have not come close to reading the patents in sufficient detail to make competent evaluations. On top of that most people, technical or not simply don&#8217;t understand the specifics of the tech that is the topic of the intellectual property law. It&#8217;s much easier to make incorrect statements. Most of the comment readers lack the legal foundation anyways to vet the miss-statements. It&#8217;s even worse when it involves something people are passionate and utterly biased for or against, like iphones, palm devices, the XBox, mp3. Read a webos forum and they&#8217;ll have you believe that they have patent that prevents anyone from making a phone without their permission. Many people think they can use any piece of music of image in their film so long as it&#8217;s not for profit. Another massive misunderstanding of copyright law. Many people incorrectly understand when fair use applies and use it as a catch all. Now granted it&#8217;s not black and white but it&#8217;s also not all encompassing. And with patent law, the most complicated discipline in IP law, requiring admission to it&#8217;s own bar, and a complex understanding of the underlying topic of the layman is simply not properly equipped to comment in the most competent manner on most issues. Now they could inform themselves and do the work but that&#8217;s hard work and consumers time. as the quote says &#8220;it&#8217;s hard.&#8221; So when you read a blog, and i&#8217;ll excuse this post cause it&#8217;s pretty on point., you should be very wary. Ask yourself are there any details? Are they looking at patent specifics? Are they familiar with the the specifics of the claims in the case? Usually that stuff is ignored, glossed over, not read or someone they just read someone else&#8217;s statments an stole them. Many tech posts are just reposts of something they read on foss patents.</p>
<p>Very well put!</p>
<p>Your post should be required reading before commenting.</p>
<p>Maybe this article will help stifle the frothing at the mouth and crazed rantings of the Apple haters.</p>
<p>It will of course depend on their reading comprehension level which, so far, has not been very good.</p>
<p>For another calm, rational and intelligent point of view, see:</p>
<p><em>&quot;James Schauer, who spent several years at RIM before becoming CEO of Harmonic Interactive Research and Design, which develops gesture-recognition technology, …believes the jury made the right decision in the Samsung-Apple patent lawsuit. &#8220;We were pretty upset when we saw Android came out&#8212;we knew they hacked all over Apple’s patents, and we were like, &#8216;This is not fair,&#8217;&#8221; he says. &#8220;<strong>I think the jury made the right ruling</strong>, but I think the real question is: Should pinch-to-zoom be patentable?&#8221;&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>Will Apple’s Pinch-To-Zoom Patent Victory Create A Usability Hell?</strong></p>
<p>Master salesman? more like con-artist.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t get all &#8220;legal&#8221; like this when Microsoft release &#8220;Zune&#8221; and that failed in success due to the &#8220;iPod&#8221;. But, Samsung puts out &#8220;Galaxy III&#8221;, which by the numbers, appears to be a better product by consumer standards.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, Apple may not like competition like most corporations, but they will find a &#8220;legal&#8221; reason to bring you down, when they are defeated in the market period. Right now, Samsung and Google (If I may) are becoming bigger competitors for Apple.</p>
<p>Much like &#8220;Amazon&#8221; will soon replace &#8220;Google&#8221; and &#8220;Facebook&#8221;.</p>
<p>the highlander!</p>
<p>at first i liked it, then gingerbread started showing its flaws, but the ICS OTA solved most of those issues and locked me to always buy a nexus. <br />
I&#8217;ll skip this current gen and get the new nexus when it comes out next fall.</p>
<p>apple&#8217;s bans permitting.</p>
<p>Nexus S is getting Jelly Bean, while Samsung Galaxy S didn&#8217;t even recieve full ICS. Nexus class devices rock!</p>
<p>time zone?</p>
<p>GMT + Australia</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running an SDK port of Jelly Bean on my Nexus S 4G and my two year old phone feels new again. I&#8217;m absolutely in love with the Nexus line.</p>
<p>;) There is a AOSP build that runs a little better than the SDK port BTW,,,</p>
<p>Any known bugs?</p>
<p>Wifi hotspot is giving me issues (as with all AOSP JB so far).<br />
Some had GPS issues wich is fixed and some still have some sdcard media scanning issues.</p>
<p>Overall, impressively good at such an early stage.</p>
<p>My next device is definately going to be a nexus device&#8230; i jus hope Samsung will make a Nexus device with decent hardware!!!</p>
<p>arrre babuji</p>
<p>They do have decent hardware..</p>
<p>Hope the 4G device is included as well!</p>
<p>Pity you couldn&#8217;t find a picture of a Vodafone one..</p>
<p>(they are white)</p>
<p>So 1pm AEST July 19th is actually today at 8pm (US time) I believe</p>
<p>&#8220;users lucky enough to run Android 4.1 Jelly Bean will be unable to stream iPlayer content until the BBC gets up to speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or you can just sideload the Flash and iPlayer apks and it will run perfectly :)</p>
<p>His do you side load flash?</p>
<p>This worked for me on a Galaxy Nexus and Motorola Xoom, both running Jellybean: <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1789385" target="new">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1789385</a></p>
<p>Get the APKs.</p>
<p>Adobe flash can be manually installed by using this guide <a href="http://www.careace.net/2012/10/03/how-to-manually-install-flash-on-your-samsung-android-device/" target="_blank">http://www.careace.net/2012/10/03/how-to-manually-install-flash-on-your-samsung-android-device/</a></p>
<p>The iPlayer app is pretty horrible &#8211; it&#8217;s like they&#8217;ve bothered with iOS and not with android.</p>
<p>Hopefully BBC will actually make a decent client soon.</p>
<p>Hopefully this gives BBC the motive todo so.</p>
<p>Yup, iPlayer for Android is pants.  High time they redesigned the app and dragged it into this century.</p>
<p><a href="http://holothere.tumblr.com/post/28788215851/holo-iplayer" target="_blank">http://holothere.tumblr.com/post/28788215851/holo-iplayer</a></p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysteriesofvernacular.com/pants.html" target="new">pants</a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find a real source for this anywhere, frustratingly, but I&#8217;m sure I read on the BBC&#8217;s online blog that they have over thirty versions of the iPlayer to maintain, so it&#8217;s probably hard for them to get a good quality native UI everywhere.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the BBC hadn&#8217;t had any warning&#8230;</p>
<p>TVCatchup have released their non-Flash dependent live streaming app into the Play Store this week &#8211; there&#8217;s no need for the BBC to stick with Flash!</p>
<p>This is making Apple&#8217;s decision to keep Flash out of iOS look pretty smart. It meant that to support iOS at all they needed to build a native app, whereas with Flash around the temptation is to reuse the same code across platforms. Here&#8217;s to hoping this pushes the BBC to make a good native Android app!</p>
<p>I think they used Flash for DRM purposes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really understand why they need DRM in the first place as the content is paid via the licence fee anyway</p>
<p>Because the BBC license the content, if people could download it they could put it on video hosting sites to allow people who don&#8217;t pay to watch it.</p>
<p>BAD BBC, down boy!</p>
<p>Eugh, what a horrid solution.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the BBC could go back and redo their app without Flash (in much the same way that the iOS app doesn&#8217;t require it). I refuse to install it until this happens.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is just a temporarily solution until they are finished.</p>
<p>Exactly. They must be creating HTML5 versions of the content already (for iOS), so how hard can it be?</p>
<p>Btw, just got the N7 and can&#8217;t watch any video content on The Verge. Any solution for that? User agent spoofing?</p>
<p>You should be able to access our video content through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.verge.android" target="new">our Android app</a>.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t even gonna tell us why? <br />
Well that sucks</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like they would tell the truth anyway: &#8220;we don&#8217;t want to put resources into upgrading those devices more than once&#8221;.</p>
<p>Is this what happens when Sony gets full control? Before this, we had Sony Ericsson stating it would support devices for at least 18 months (as per Google&#8217;s own recommendations). The arc S isn&#8217;t 18 months old.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, if they updated the arc S, they might as well do the earlier 2011 models too. Doesn&#8217;t Sony realise that not upgrading an old phone doesn&#8217;t ensure people buy a new phone, it stops people trusting your brand &#8211; and not buying a new phone because the chances are that won&#8217;t get supported either. (Hello Motorola, I&#8217;m looking at you&#8230;)</p>
<p>Add in news that Sony is now refusing to repair the yellow screen problem on the Xperia S (a known production fault) if someone has unlocked the bootloader, and I do fear for the future of Sony Mobile.</p>
<p>all 2011 xperia line except for play get ICS already. so i think that is enough support for now.</p>
<p>i suspect the prioritize 2012 line updated before reconsider weather 2011 line will get update</p>
<blockquote>Doesn’t Sony realise that not upgrading an old phone doesn’t ensure people buy a new phone, it stops people trusting your brand – and not buying a new phone because the chances are that won’t get supported either.</blockquote>
<p>If that was true, then nobody will buy any Android devices other than the Nexus lineup. People are still buying HTC, Samsung, Motorola Android phones.</p>
<p>Most of the &#8220;normal&#8221; people doesn&#8217;t even now or care about the updates, but for the people like us that care about this is a bad deal, in anyway you wanna see ot they&#8217;re not going to make any profit with this things</p>
<p>Another reason by the one I just care about Nexus</p>
<p>Xperia 2011 portfolio was released on January-February 2011. The 18 months full support ended. Xperia Arc S and Neo V are just refreshes of the Arc and Neo.</p>
<p>By unlocking the bootloader, you can overclock your phone which will increase the temperature thus giving you a yellow tint. Also, by unlocking the bootloader, you agree to void your phone warranty.</p>
<p>Sony, you make it so hard to defend you guys.</p>
<p>On the other hand, thanks for the bootloader unlock!</p>

<p>(GSM)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a given outside the US. GSM is truly worldwide, and it&#8217;s your only option if you plan to travel a lot or you&#8217;re based outside the US.</p>
<p>Waiting for an interoperable standard like GSM/UMTS that offers speeds faster than LTE. TD-LTE seems like just that, but it lacks interest among carriers.</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s true but I was just referring to the fact that all the Verizon and Samsung managed Nexus phones are on 4.0.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the list of Verizon and Samsung managed Nexus phones only comprise of the Galaxy Nexus, which launched with ICS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if you understand what I&#8217;m saying. That&#8217;s the point. Their on 4.0. 4.1 is available for the Google Nexus.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, CDMA proprietary firmware is to blame for it. The code differs for each carrier and usually the carriers keep it under lock and key and away from Google/Samsung.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s still a mystery how Apple handles updates. They either get carriers to update their firmware in advance, or the carriers simply give code to Apple.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;m rocking my interoperable GSM Galaxy Nexus with Jelly Bean since day 1.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t bend over that much or ever to carriers. Fuckin hate these useless carriers, just be dumb pipe and let companies who know to make phones/software do their job,</p>
<p>Samsung has announced they&#8217;ll update the Brazilian Galaxy Nexus (called here &#8220;Galaxy X&#8221; for legal reasons &#8211; Google didn&#8217;t come to an agreement with small telco Nexus for the use of their name) to Jelly Bean this August.</p>
<p>Downside is that GSM doesn&#8217;t penetrate through older building walls and is a huge pain in the ass in some cities.  I don&#8217;t like Verizon, but they&#8217;re much more reliable in this case.</p>
<p>I would rather not have a phone than have to deal with Verizon&#8217;s crap. AT&amp;T&#8217;s not much better, but they are the major GSM carrier.</p>
<p>GSM works well in jam-packed Indian cities like Mumbai. If GSM doesn&#8217;t work well in US cities which are less dense, your carrier is to blame for not setting up enough towers to ensure better connectivity. I&#8217;ve heard Chris criticize AT&amp;T HSPA in Chicago, so it&#8217;s clearly AT&amp;T&#8217;s fault since HSPA works well in other cities like SF.</p>
<p>I agree that building penetration is inferior in the case of GSM, but when there are an equivalent number of towers for both CDMA and GSM, the difference is minor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so much the standard (GSM/HSPA) that doesn&#8217;t work in the US&#8230; it&#8217;s capacity issues. AT&amp;T has huge issues with capacity. If they supplied their towers with more bandwidth, they would be fine.</p>
<p>Then how are Indian carriers like Airtel handling unlimited data in cities like Mumbai <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_by_population">that are 8 times denser than NYC </a>? There are more cell phones over there, and true UL data plans are much cheaper. Still, it works out well, with almost no downtime.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T should sort out their bandwidth it&#8217;s annoying (apparently) yet not hard to fix. Instead of fixing the problem, they&#8217;re saving money to push for advertising campaigns to sway users from Verizon in an act of greed.</p>
<p>Firstly, most GSM carriers in India don&#8217;t offer Unlimited 3G data plans (Although, 2G unlimited data plans are quite commonplace). Only CDMA/EVDO carriers (Like MTS, Tata DoCoMo and Reliance) have unlimited broadband data plans on their tariff-sheets. And even those carriers don&#8217;t offer truly-unlimited data. For instance, MTS&#8217;s top-tier EVDO plan costs Rs.1298 (Approx. $30) and bundles &#8220;15GB Unlimited Data&#8221;. What that entails is that after a user surpasses the 15GB mark on his connection he will be throttled to CDMA 1x Speeds. This is to ensure nobody hogs bandwidth, I guess.</p>
<p>Secondly, while it is true that the amount people using mobile phones is much greater in India than in the States, but I am pretty sure that not even 10% of those people use data actively (as India&#8217;s dismal Internet penetration figures suggest). The fact that the majority of Indians use feature-phones is also factor worth considering.</p>
<p>First of all, other than MTNL, I know no other GSM carrier in Mumbai that has unlimited 3G data.</p>
<p>Secondly, even with the limited data, the networks still suffer from excessive load, especially since the recent price cut. Vodafone especially went down the drain in terms of speed after that last 3G price drop.</p>
<p>I agree that the network reception is faultless in Mumbai due to the innumerable towers. But you can&#8217;t do much if the speeds you get are shit.</p>
<p>Well, you proved my point. GSM doesn&#8217;t exactly mean lousy coverage. AT&amp;T&#8217;s coverage is lousy, though.</p>
<p>Consistent speeds are a different thing, which isn&#8217;t hard since Verizon, etc handle it well already in the US, and AT&amp;T sure could do the same by increasing bandwidth to towers. They aren&#8217;t limited by the cellular technology.</p>
<p>Durno about that. I haven&#8217;t had a problem with AT&amp;T&#8217;s coverage; I just spent an afternoon in the middle of nowhere and I still have HSPA coverage.</p>
<p>I think I clearly said that GSM doesn&#8217;t penetrate some buildings well enough.  Towers have nothing to do with it, the frequencies it runs on simply do not fit through the &#8220;holes&#8221; in the support wire of the building&#8217;s walls.</p>
<p>Hmm, I tried Straight Talk for a month (AT&amp;T MVNO) and the locker room at work where my Sprint phone goes roaming or barely gets native Sprint service I had 3 bars and a solid connection.</p>
<p>Technically you could have a chip that worked on all networks and that is easy, except the lovely things called carriers don&#8217;t like that</p>
<p>Nice old-school TIMN watermark!</p>
<p>The picture is from the Xperia Mini Pro review, which was from before the launch of The Verge.</p>
<p>That looks like its gonna be pretty cool man!</p>

<p>this is exactly why I can&#8217;t buy Sony phones, eventhough they are soooo well designed. Really a bummer :( sticking to nexus then</p>
<p>I bought a Sony Xperia Ray in November last year in the UK.. I bought it because of the size and the promise from Sony for an update to ICS&#8230;. still didn&#8217;t get any ICS update&#8230;. got fed up waiting&#8230;  unlocked bootloader&#8230; installed the Sony ICS manually&#8230;  it is the worst software update.. So now I am free and I am using Cyanogen mod 9.0 RC2&#8230; its awesome&#8230; but I decided that I will never ever buy or recommend a Sony phone for anyone&#8230;</p>
<p>HTC on the other hand gave awesome update for HTC Sensation and their other phones&#8230; but I don&#8217;t like HTC phone hardware as such&#8230; Samsung is an other bad software company&#8230; because of the bad software people are forced to unlock the bootloader and void their warranty.. So who is good??? I really don&#8217;t know&#8230; I hope Google forces Motorola to always give vanilla android&#8230; then I would go for that&#8230; Instead of all that modifiations the companies make, they can give some Google play store credit so that the user can install the apps/widgets they require&#8230;. Money spent on making those horrible UI can be spend better&#8230;</p>
<p>Ha? My Xperia Ray had ICS since 7th of May 2012&#8230;did you try using SEUS?</p>
<p>What? ICS 4.0.4 for Ray from Sony is very good on it own way (except the LED part). and you know what, I thanked for that update a lot, stock based ROM ways better than FXP CM9: JJhybird, Pureness, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>And if you buying anything not the top-tier from HTC and Samsung, you gonna have more bad time than with Sony.</p>
<p>&#8220;From an italian statistics, in Italy, (and we are not lucky with update speed) companies have upgraded their terminals (smartphones and tablet) to the next android&#8217;s version in these percentages:</p>
<p>Nexus (75%), Sony/Sony Ericsson (65,4%), ASUS (50%), HTC (48,1%), Motorola &amp; Samsung (33,3%), Acer (27,8%), LG (25%), Huawei-Vodafone (7,7%), Alcatel-Vodafone/Olivetti/Onda/Packard Bell/Panasonic (0%).</p>
<p>And the number of devices updated is the:</p>
<p>Sony/Sony Ericsson (17 devices), HTC (13 devices), Samsung (12 devices), Motorola (7 devices), Acer (5 devices), LG (5 devices), Nexus (3 devices), ASUS (2 devices), Huawei (1 device).</p>
<p>Moreover from this statistics:</p>
<p>total numbers of updates: 0 update = 63.9%; 1 update =29,4%; 2 updates=6,7%<br />
average price of a smartphone that has received 2 updates= 489€&quot;</p>
<p>Got from Fumas @ XDA</p>
<p>So, buy Nexus or Sony, I dont like large phone, so Sony is the only option for me.</p>
<p>Nice hardware shackled to frozen in amber software.. thats old school cell phone business. Your phone has bugs? Go buy yet another handset.<br />
People are waking up to this scam.<br />
Nexus devices are selling faster than they can be manufactured..</p>
<p>Crap, this means the end of the line for my Xperia Arc.</p>
<p>Some months old Android device is not getting the latest update? It&#8217;s that day of the week again?</p>
<p>I hope 2012&#8217;s portfolio will get Jellybean&#8230; But, yeah, Xperia U didn&#8217;t get even an ICS yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry guys, but this is why you should all buy a Nexus, or mean how to flash ROMs.</p>
<p>This is good for everyone.  Possible fix for fragmentation. Lets see how it works.</p>
<p>win</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q15uIk36jKw/TXGXpffkQmI/AAAAAAAAApA/jMdMNXPSU6E/cats+winning.jpg" /></p>
<p>Maybe next year at Google IO they will have promises to get devices (launched in the last 18 months) with updates the same day as the Nexuses.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t make promises like that, which is why tools like the PDK are important. Software updates for non-nexus devices are entirely out of Google&#8217;s hands. The PDK is intended to put the ball into manufacturer&#8217;s courts.</p>
<p>Wonder if this initiative will disappear into the ether thanks to lazy OEMs and carriers, like the vaunted update alliance</p>
<p>This is different. That update alliance relied upon everyone in it to keep their word. With this PDK, Google develops and releases it. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the only commitment being made here. It&#8217;s up to everyone else to take advantage of it. This is also being done to improve relationships with OEM&#8217;s and to attract interest from players not yet tapped.</p>
<p>A few examples:</p>
<p>AMD &#8211; They could show off an APU designed for tablets while showing how much performance it has with the latest hotness. A great way to try to grab some more revenue for themselves.</p>
<p>HTC &#8211; They throw their phones everywhere and compete very fiercely on hardware but their thunder gets stolen quite a bit. They can gain much more traction if they (or any OEM really) can move quickly enough to bring their latest flagship device to market with the next OS and their own customizations.</p>
<p>HP &#8211; They were originally going to ship WebOS on PC&#8217;s but gave up. Why not ship hybrid Windows 8/Android X.X laptops? It could be a major differentiator in the x86 market if they had a laptop/tablet that could gain extra attention by providing a beefier version of your cell phone experience.</p>
<p>I could keep going on, this is such an awesome way to try to calm fears about owning Motorola. They&#8217;ve made significant commitments to their OEM&#8217;s and anyone else interested in the platform, all that needs to happen is to have Google follow through on it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my point, it&#8217;s up to everyone else to take advantage of it, the same situation we have today with the timescales shifted around a bit. Anybody who thinks this will result in future visions of android penetrating the market faster is likely mistaken.</p>
<p>A handful of flagships will get an update or two, before they are replaced by next years model and largely forgotten. The unwashed masses of handsets won&#8217;t get jack, ever.</p>
<p>The initiative itself is just Google committing to releasing this Platform Development Kit. They didn&#8217;t make an announcement that rivaled the false support promise of the Update Alliance. All that was announced here is that Google is giving better support to OEM&#8217;s at a significantly earlier time. I don&#8217;t believe that they&#8217;ll just stop providing the PDK after 1 or two years. It may eventually become engrained into too many company&#8217;s business plans.</p>
<p>this can&#8217;t disappear this just means they give info earlier&#8230;</p>
<p>Will this go the way of the fabled update alliance, time will tell.</p>
<p>I wonder if this is going to lead to more leaks of future versions of Android.</p>
<p>That bezel<br />
Looks insanely small</p>
<p>Because the screen is really big, probably.<br />
Verizon&#8217;s tacky red accents are horrible.<br />
I also don&#8217;t like how HTC keep backing away from the microdrilled speaker holes on the front.</p>
<p>Is the red mesh on the sides a speaker grille?</p>
<p>But I agree, between the polarizing Verizon red, and the logo front and center, yuck. Looks like a killer piece of kit, though. Spec champion indeed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming the mesh is just decoration, the speaker grill is a red strip on the front.<br />
Compared to <a href="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/J9LK/htc-one-x-jelly-bean-update-begins-0.jpg?20121029-181044">this</a>, it feels like HTC&#8217;s design is devolving.</p>
<p>Upon closer look, the mesh does look like a loudspeaker. HTC do love their speakers.</p>
<p>beats audio gimmick&#8230;</p>
<p>THIS PHONE.</p>
<p>I wish they&#8217;d make a white &amp; blue one and give it to me on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>white and black &gt;</p>
<p>which i think they also have</p>
<p>Which also sounds nice, but I was under the impression that this will be a Verizon exclusive?</p>
<p>More like, spec demon, with those colors.</p>
<p>Pink would be tacky; red as a thin strip on the sides and back is understated and appropriate since it&#8217;s version&#8217;s logo&#8217;s color</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only &#8220;appropriate&#8221; if you enjoy advertising your carrier to anyone who just glances at your phone.</p>
<p>I say they should offer a more subdued color scheme for $199, and a LOWER price for the Verizon red (why shouldn&#8217;t you pay less to advertise  for them?).</p>
<p>Nothing a bit of well-applied permanent Sharpie won&#8217;t fix.</p>
<p>The screen is big, but the form factor is much smaller than the Note.</p>
<p>Red accents have been on HTC phones since the OG Evo on Sprint&#8230;I happened to like them and don&#8217;t find them tacky at all.  Opinions are awesome.</p>
<p>opinions are like aßholes they&#8217;re a necessary evil and ubiquitious; definitely NOT awesome</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good thing, IMO.</p>
<p>That logo looks insanely awful. I get it &#8211; branding, but it just spoils it. Like the LG logo &#8211; Verizon&#8217;s is just awful.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find any hardware buttons, either.</p>
<p>Everything OK but the ugly Verizon logo&#8230;why?</p>
<p>Exactly! I can&#8217;t care about Verizon, even if they have America&#8217;s Largest Network simply because they use CDMA.</p>
<p>this makes zero sense.</p>
<p>I think he may be meaning that CDMA towers have much more coverage compared to GSM/UMTS technology? possibly.</p>
<p>CDMA offers no portability. Buy a phone on Verzion, it&#8217;s Verizons, not mine&#8230;.</p>
<p>But upon some digging, I see this phone has GSM and UMTS/HSPA antennas. It&#8217;s a little bit more in my interests now. I&#8217;ll have to keep my ears up for any reviews.</p>
<p>You have to if you want this phone&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Verizon. Let&#8217;s just be glad they didn&#8217;t put the logo across the bottom three buttons.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still wondering how Apple managed to stop Verizon from putting their logo on the front of the CDMA iPhones&#8230;</p>
<p>Easy.  They said &#8220;If you want the single most popular smartphone on the planet, you&#8217;ll play by our rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>No other manufacturer can have that level of control over their devices with U.S. carriers at this point.</p>
<p>True&#8230;but Samsung is getting close.</p>
<p>Nexus phones have no branding either</p>
<p>Nexus phones arent carrier sub-sided, they are unlocked and you stick a SIM card in it, but if you want LTE, youre gonna have to stick an Ugly carrier company logo to its back, case in point Samsung Galaxy Nexus for Verizon and Sprint.</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s on Verizon (and Sprint).</p>
<p>because there is no home button to put it on&#8230;.</p>
<p>Who cares? <br />
Or more specifically because plainly some people do, WHY care?</p>
<p>Because people don&#8217;t want their phones to be used as billboards.</p>

<p>That is all.</p>
<p>not anymore I thought</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>is the bezel reli that thin?? OvO</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t, its a render. Look at the videos, its like every other phone.</p>
<p>The bezel is in fact that thin, look at the pics of it over at Engaget.</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t<br />
<img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/11/dsc04759.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looks exactly the same as it does on the Verge so how can it be a render&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/8498/droiddna.png" /></p>
<p>The article picture is a render.</p>
<p>That is really really sexy. I really hope it&#8217;s not like $800 off contract.</p>
<p>Why oh why isn&#8217;t this the Nexus 5?!</p>
<p>Take away verizon branding and Sense, and its the perfect phone. (at least for someone with big hands like myself)</p>
<p>Exactly.  I want that phone soooo bad</p>
<p>Because of the soft keys.</p>
<p>This would be my next but I can&#8217;t afford a phone off contract right now and Verizon can pry my unlimited data from my cold, dead hands.</p>
<p>im in the same boat with AT&amp;T grandfathered unlimited for $30 plan, although they throttle you if you go over 5gb on LTE :/</p>
<p>Luckily I can return the Galaxy S3 that replaced my now dead Galaxy Nexus for this thing. Still under 14 day return window.   I would rather have a Nexus 4, but my office uses Verizon so that is not really an option.  Hopefully this thing gets rooted asap so I can get rid of Sense and the awful apps forced on me by Verizon Wireless.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d stick with the GS3 personally. Judging by the state of development of recent HTC phones on VZW, I&#8217;m not optimistic this phone will garner all that much development support in the long run.</p>
<p>Meaning that they can&#8217;t get the binaries and open the bootloaders?  I&#8217;d love to get a Nexus 4, but that isn&#8217;t happening.  What will they be able to do to a S3 that they can&#8217;t to an HTC phone?</p>
<p>Well he wants to root it anyways, plus HTC lets you easily <a href="http://htcdev.com">unlock the bootloader.</a></p>
<p>Wow an HTC phone that I actually LIKE the look of &#8211; except for the red stripe (should have made it grey or brushed alum)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s this world coming to?</p>
<p>seriously.  this garish &#8220;droid&#8221; branding that verizon is pushing is so disgusting.  who wants that?</p>
<p>Pretty much, the majority of smartphone owners on Verizon. Not too many at all.</p>
<p>Something tells me the majority of Verizon customers are there for other reasons than red lines on everything.</p>
<p>This thing, running CM10.1, is a serious contender for the best phone ever made.</p>
<p>haha, im betting its a locked bootloader&#8230; nexus 4 all the way&#8230;.</p>
<p>How is this relevant when the Nexus 4 won&#8217;t work on Verizon and you won&#8217;t find this phone on any other US carrier?</p>
<p>1) Why do you want a phone working on Verizon? 2) are you sure we wont find this phone on any other US Carrier?</p>
<p>1. Because I like my unlimited data and superior network coverage.<br />
2. As of now, I only see indications that this is a Verizon exclusive. Verizon never received the HOX line so there is no reason for me to think that this phone will make its way to other carriers.</p>
<p>1) Not everyone has the &#8220;luxury&#8221; of living where you are. People without this &#8220;luxury&#8221; may have Verizon as the best choice for them network wise. In my area the ranking of carriers is Verizon 1, T-Mobile 2, AT&amp;T 3, and Sprint 4.</p>
<p>2) A version may be released to other carriers under a different name. We won&#8217;t know unless they ever announce it. But as of right now, Verizon announced this phone as an exclusive to Verizon.</p>
<p>Sprint is always last, ha. Where I live, AT&amp;T and Verizon are tied, then T-Mobile, then Sprint a distant last.</p>
<p>Depends. I have a friend that lives in Tulsa. Apparently Sprint is one of the better choices there. I did a three month stint on Sprint&#8230;It was horrible. I rarely had a signal outside of an small area around the interstate. Network has not been built up here at all. As far as I know, still waiting on WiMax too. I spent around 10 years on T-Mobile. It was great. Unfortunately over the past couple years their customer service nose-dived to the point that I was fed up with them. Hence why I have been on Verizon for about a year now. I have enough friends who are or were on AT&amp;T to know to stay away from them. But it is amazing the difference between Verizon and T-Mobiles networks around here. I didn&#8217;t have much issue out of them network wise. There were a few dead spots around town but not too bad. I have a good time giving my few friends that are still on T-Mo are hard time when they don&#8217;t have a signal and I do.</p>
<p>My company pays for the phone, and contract.  We use Verizon, so the choice of getting a Nexus 4 isn&#8217;t an option unless I want the Galaxy Nexus. So Verizon it is unfortunately is with all of their Draconian BS.</p>
<p>Have fun with that RIL.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just not phased by massive specs anymore. All high end phones are super powerful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying we should stop progressing, but I just don&#8217;t get excited by specs anymore.</p>
<p>Then you will be happy with the iPhone&#8230;</p>
<p>As will just about everyone. :-)</p>
<p>I dunno. My black coating chipped today and I Am Disappoint.</p>
<p>on what? still good with mine. I have the thinnest case i&#8217;ve ever seen on it and a screen protector tho.</p>
<p>The iPhone GPU blows any android device out of the water including this Droid DNA and any the Nexus 10.</p>
<p>Which, just like the CPU, goes unnoticed in day to day use.</p>
<p>Keep us posted, Tim Cook.</p>
<p>It took 1 comment to become a flamefest&#8230;</p>
<p>Well done Verge,</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t flaming just saying my recommendations, sorry to offend you. Don&#8217;t you like the iPhone?</p>
<p>Sure you weren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Stop trying to make us believe your not a troll!  People were commenting on the the DNA and you take a pot shot at the iPhone !  2 amazing phones if you ask me!</p>
<p>Same here. I&#8217;m at the point where I&#8217;m more excited about software, which is why I&#8217;ve been sticking with Nexus devices. Still, though, this is a beast of a phone.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s easier to tick off a specs checklist than to create a product that does what consumers want to do.</p>
<p>I kinda understand what you mean. I felt that way back earlier this year, which made me just jump to a feature phone. I think I&#8217;m ready to go back to Android though&#8230;</p>
<p>This thing looks quite sexy. Probably the only phone right now that would make me consider switching to Android. Thin, fast, good screen, decent camera.. only worry is the battery life with that 4G + 1080p AND quad core&#8230;</p>
<p>God I hope it doesn&#8217;t burn through anything&#8230;</p>
<p>And HTC Sense. The most magical piece of utter crap ever put on a phone.</p>
<p>whats wrong with it exactly?</p>
<p>The inferior task switcher when compared to stock Android and the overaggressive memory management are two problems with it off of the top of my head.</p>
<p>Fair enough.   Similar to the terrible phone dialer in stock android and cartoonish app icons.</p>
<p>My point is as much shit as tech heads want to give android skins, they have brought additional functionality to some areas and took some away from others.  I actually do not agree with Verge that stock android is best for everyone.    Of course its been getting better but android skins were used to fix the garbage that was stock android UI for quite some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;were&#8221; is the operative word, here. post ICS, the skins should die.</p>
<p>Dialer is still messed up and the messaging interface could use some work.    Lets be real here though, if stock android was as amazing as the verge seems to think, wouldn&#8217;t nexus devices be far more successful?</p>
<p>What is wrong with the dialer? Messaging could be better, but has any skin really fixed that? Google needs to add something WebOS Synergy to do it right. Otherwise, the Nexus isn&#8217;t supposed to be a huge seller. That should be obvious with the amount of marketing Google has given it.</p>
<p>Dialer&#8230;last i used it doesn&#8217;t search from the keypad.   And yes Sense fixed messaging and has WebOS synergy plugs.  So does Touchwiz.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall the Galaxy SII really having this momentous marketing budget and yet it sold well.   I don&#8217;t  buy that nexus would sell that much better with marketing behind it.   Maybe the Nexus 4 as it actually seems a much better complete package than nexus&#8217; before it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because you are thinking as an informed techie should.  The vast majority of the population are content to make life choices based on what general advertising spoonfeeds to them.</p>
<p>Nexus devices probably would be more popular if it was marketed as aggressively as other phones and wasn&#8217;t hurt by cdma carriers stranglehold on their networks.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.  The most successful phones are typically the ones pushed hardest by the carriers, and Nexus phones are not in that boat.</p>
<p>Sprint pushed the galaxy nexus pretty hard.</p>
<p>And I kind of wish they worked with Google to get the Nexus 4 on their network.</p>
<p>Would be nice&#8230;Sprint is turning into a lame duck.</p>
<p>EVOs are still cool</p>
<p>Does the stock dialer still not support &#8220;smart dialing&#8221;? The T9-ish feature where you can search contacts by dialing the number of the letter you&#8217;re after.</p>
<p>group think, many people just parrot what others say and don&#8217;t form opinions on their own.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what <strong>everyone</strong> says&#8230; /s</p>
<p>Well played&#8230;</p>
<p>Not an issue. Root, put stock on, all good.l</p>
<p>It certainly is an issue since the RIL will have to be hacked&#8230;</p>
<p>Forgive my ignorance, but what is that? I&#8217;m of the opinion that this will be a great device with stock if battery life will hold up.</p>
<p>TouchWiz, Sense, and MotoBlur all use custom frameworks on which their custom apps and functionality run. The RIL is a part of framework the which controls how the phone and its hardware communicate with the network.</p>
<p><a href="http://rootzwiki.com/topic/29045-ril/" target="_blank">http://rootzwiki.com/topic/29045-ril/</a></p>
<p>12th! Now on a serious note: I wonder how large the battery capacity is. For that kind of display + quad core I expect we&#8217;ll need something fairly large. I also wonder why they don&#8217;t do the buttons on screen. That could have made the whole device smaller while still be 1080p. But whateves.</p>
<blockquote>That could have made the whole device smaller while still be 1080p.</blockquote>
<p>Unlikely. Take a look where the capacitive buttons on this thing are, then compare with any phone with onscreen buttons.</p>
<p>I suppose it depends on implementation. They could have made a bottom bezel similarly sized to the Optimums G and then on-screen buttons.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a 2020mah&#8230;. And the other disappointing thing is, it only has 16gb storage (11gb free), no expandable storage&#8230; Ugh</p>
<p>Unless HTC worked some serious magic with Sense, battery life is going to be sub-par. The S3 has a bigger battery with a smaller screen and lasts me a full day of moderate use. Heavy use dictates a charger or use of my spare battery.</p>
<p>Moderate to heavy users of the DNA will be constantly searching for an outlet. Yay for sealed bodies&#8230;</p>
<p>My biggest knocks on the GS3 are its display (it gives me headaches) and the plastic build (shudder). An aluminum GS3 with an LCD display would rock.</p>
<p>An aluminum SGS3 would have to drop NFC support, NFC can&#8217;t penetrate metal.</p>
<p>I never use NFC. It wouldn&#8217;t be a miss for me.</p>
<p>I think the 16gbs limit is probably the biggest limitation. Not releasing 32gb SKU would be a huge disappointment.</p>
<p>Must&#8230;not&#8230;lust over this phone! Why did the Thunderbolt have to leave such a sour taste in my mouth?! If it wasn&#8217;t for Verizon&#8217;s ridiculous prices, I would actually go for this even after damning HTC to hell!</p>
<p>This is basically Thunderbolt mk2, though, isn&#8217;t it? In that it has a brand new spec which is soon to become commonplace, but in getting there first, HTC have probably made sacrifices, some obvious (battery life), others less so.<br />
I think the Rezound might have been the first phone to hit 720p, and, uh, yeah, that one wasn&#8217;t great either. Basically ignore HTC whenever they go &#8220;First!&#8221;, especially if it&#8217;s on Verizon.</p>
<p>Actually, the Rezound was largely the Thunderbolt 2 (if I&#8217;m not mistaken, before the Thunderbolt crashed so badly, the Rezound was supposed to be named the Thunderbolt 2.</p>
<p>Actually, the Rezound remains a pretty spectacular phone&#8230;not sure where you&#8217;re coming from?</p>
<p>It was panned for being much thicker than the competition.</p>
<p>A &#8220;spectacular&#8221; phone with a nearly nonexistent user-base thanks to the Galaxy Nexus. The Rezound had its fair share of issues and I&#8217;m fairly certain following the Thunderbolt didn&#8217;t help it at all.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t even consider the Rezound simply because I owned the Thunderbolt. I was all-in on the Galaxy Nexus simply because HTC did such a horrific job with the Thunderbolt.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even consider the DNA because of the sealed body and 2020mAh battery which is simply just not enough battery for a 5&quot; screen. HTC still doesn&#8217;t get it&#8230;</p>
<p>16gb? what the actual fuck!</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if 1080p on a 5&quot; device turns out to be a significant benefit. The bigger concern though is the 2,020mAh that the J Butterfly comes with.  From these shots it looks like a sealed battery so that may turn out to be an achilles heel.</p>
<p>This phone is stupid.</p>
<p>I have quite the phone buying decision coming up.</p>
<p>So 5.3 inches is a tablet, but 5 inches is a phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to live in this world.</p>
<p>*Phablet, the correct pronunciation is Phablet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost positive Vlad will be referring to this as a tablet too. It would be inconsistent if he didn&#8217;t since he calls the Note II in his own review a tablet.</p>
<p>Way too big. Ugly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Way too big&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>but the .3&quot; smaller Glalaxy S 3 that has already sold 30 million units is perfect!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Those .3&#8217;&#8217; actually make a difference. Put a SGS3 side by side with a Note and you&#8217;ll notice it.</p>
<p>thats because a note is 5.5 inches</p>
<p>Likewise a 4.7&quot; S3 compared to the 5&quot; Note is still quite different.</p>
<p>You mean the 0.2&quot; smaller Galaxy S3&#8230;.  the screen of the SGS3 is 4.8&quot;</p>
<p>Damn, this thing has a very small bezel, wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s not bigger than 4.7 inch screen phones!!</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t look at the videos, this is a render :-(</p>
<p>i&#8217;m good on 5&quot; thanks.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what she said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather not have the Verizon logo plastered on the front, but I could live with it.<br />
Worst thing HTC does is not pay enough attention to Battery Life.  Let&#8217;s see if they learned from mistakes.</p>
<p>Judging by the 2020mAh battery, they haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Silly Verizon&#8230; your trying to temp me away from that Nexus 4 aren&#8217;t you. Not biting.</p>
<p>I shan&#8217;t fall for it either!</p>
<p>Be strong my friend. Stock Android is what you want!</p>
<p>1080p is the resolution we deserve, not the one we need right now.</p>
<p>So we must chase it.</p>

<p>Because he&#8217;s the latest HTC hero Android deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we&#8217;ll root him. Because he can take it. Because he&#8217;s not our Nexus. He&#8217;s SD cardless, that needs a watchful protector case. A Droid light.</p>
<p>With a 202mAh battery, it&#8217;s obvious HTC hasn&#8217;t learned from the past.</p>
<p>2020mAh. And that&#8217;s pretty standard. Bigger is better, but I don&#8217;t want my phone having a tumor coming out of it.</p>
<p>I have major concerns about that battery given the screen. Every day use is probably ok, but I fear watching a video or playing a game will kill it quick. Guess we&#8217;ll have to see what the reviews think.</p>
<p>But how do you explain the Razor? It still maintains its super slick body with a huge battery and so does the S3. What is HTC excuse?</p>
<p>The Note 2 has a 3100mAh battery and is only 9.4mm thick. <br />
The S3 has a 2100mAh battery and is only 8.6mm thick.<br />
The Razr HD has a 2500mAh battery and is only 8.4mm thick.</p>
<p>Its interesting that HTC is always at the front of the spec race with phones that have terrible battery life, and Motorla keeps behind the spec race with huge battery life. They are, of course, loosing to Samsung who takes the middle ground.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s 440.58 PPI according to <a href="http://members.ping.de/~sven/dpi.html" target="_blank">http://members.ping.de/~sven/dpi.html</a> :O</p>
<p>This is madness! It&#8217;s like videophiles in steroids ^^</p>
<p>Looks like Verizon finally getting rid of that extra $100 premium for their high end phones compared to other carriers.  I wonder what the off contract pricing will be?</p>
<p>599.99 off contract from Verizon.</p>
<p>I think this pricing has more to do with HTC being desperate for sales than Verizon changing their pricing structure.</p>
<p>I prefer 720p with the same battery inside.</p>
<p>As a Global User, this CDMA device has no relevance to me.</p>
<p> 4G LTE, CDMA, Quad GSM, Quad UMTS</p>
<p>its a world phone.</p>
<p>Oh man. This is news to me!</p>
<p>Can you get it unlocked and use the Quad GSM on T-Mobile&#8217;s band?</p>
<p>Dont know that yet, but i would assume so&#8230; They haven&#8217;t given that info out, but it is a world phone, so i think it should.</p>
<p>iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 are also GSM, but without the recent T-Mobile upgrades in your area you only get 2G.  I think it has to do with which band they operate on.</p>
<p>I want to see a frequency spec sheet for cellular radios.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll wait for the 4K resolution version.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that we still don&#8217;t have 4K TV ubiquity. There&#8217;s no way a 50&quot; 4K screen is harder to produce than a 5&quot; 1080p one.</p>
<p>4K TV ubiquity will happen in the near future. Just be patient.</p>
<p>Well first of all there is no 4K content. And there is no 4K content coming in the near future. And at a 50&quot; size and normal viewing distances, you can&#8217;t perceive the difference between 1080p and 2160p.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also not sure that there is really much benefit of 1080p here over 720p. I doubt you can perceive the increased pixel density without touching the screen to your nose.</p>
<p>Depending on how bad this thing eats the battery, it could be my next.</p>
<p>The verizon logo is tacky, but I&#8217;ve never been as bothered by that stuff as most of you guys :)</p>
<p>Another one with no microSD,hope they choke on it.</p>
<p>You know what else it doesn&#8217;t have? A FLOPPY DRIVE.</p>
<p>Oh my god, this is the best possible response to that tired argument.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not.  How many 1080p videos are you going to fit in 16GB of storage?  A microSD slot is very valuable to many people.</p>
<p>Then don&#8217;t get a phone with 16GB of storage. It&#8217;s that simple.<br />
 Instead of pushing for expandable slots, I feel like people should push for more onboard storage. Is it more expensive? Sometimes, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be. The One X+ has 64GB without a hefty price penalty.</p>
<p>Expandable slots allow you to decide what storage capacity is right for you, but don&#8217;t limit you from changing you mind later.</p>
<p>Some people value flexibility.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be more alright with no expandable storage if there was actually a meaningful amount of internal storage. But how are you going to talk about 16GB of storage while at the same time touting the 1080p video capabilities of your phone?</p>
<p>Where, praytell, are you going to store that video?</p>
<p>Just because you personally are tired of hearing about it, that doesn&#8217;t automatically qualify the position as a &#8220;tired argument&#8221;.</p>
<p>For people who are not always is densely populated areas with ubiquitous WiFi, having only 16GB of space is a ridiculous and unnecessary limitation.</p>
<p>Or a user upgradable storage drive.  Sorry, if you don&#8217;t want people to complain don&#8217;t give us a meager 16 gigs of storage.  <br />
Although, I will say that 199 (on contract) is a great price for the phone, I wouldn&#8217;t mind a $249 option for 32 gigs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been saying this since the phone was leaked: this won&#8217;t have an SD card slot because Verizon doesn&#8217;t want it to. Verizon WANTS you to have to use cloud storage. It burns up your data plan and allows them to hit you with overages.</p>
<p>Replacing my Galaxy Nexus early.</p>
<p>A design as gorgeous as the Butterfly J deserves vanilla Android 4.2 and to be on every carrier.</p>
<p>That logo just sours this beauty -. Will there be a variant of this  ala One X 5 on AT&amp;T ? and for christ sake when this comes to other carriers please put a microSd slot.</p>
<p><img src="http://silellak.com/lets_play/jizzinmypants.jpg" /></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell by the pictures, but is the button on the right side of the phone the volume rocker or power/unlock button?  It would really suck to have a the unlock button on the top of a 5 inch phone.</p>
<p>Just checked out the blurry hands on shots at Engadget.  The power/unlock button is on top,  which means a very uncomfortable way to unlock/wake it up.</p>
<p>HTC always do this and they need to knock it off.</p>
<p>If I had the option of a 1080p display with 10hrs of battery or 720p display with 12hrs of battery, i&#8217;d take 720p all day long. I just have a feeling that these phones are putting display quality over battery life too much. Make me a phone that will last all day with me having the screen on 4 hrs, and you&#8217;ll have a happy customer on your hands.</p>
<p>Agreed. I wish Verizon hadn&#8217;t dicked HTC over by not going for the One X or One X+. I would have been fine buying that in June. Will probably buy this instead though.</p>
<p>Lasts all day with 4hrs on-screen time? Don&#8217;t even consider an HTC. The S3 and Razr HD fit the bill.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2010/06/06-10-10paulmillerpde.jpg" /></p>
<p>Give this a treatment of Nexus styling (understated and high-quality materials) and it&#8217;s what the Nexus 4 should have been.</p>
<p>I just need to know one thing&#8230;. Is this thing coming to T-Mobile?  If so&#8230;. when?  I&#8217;ve got a buddy looking at the Galaxy Note 2, but this looks way better.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Looks beautiful. But non-accessible battery and no microSD are a bit of a deal breakers in a device with a 1080p display. If I want to watch 1080p movies on that display I won&#8217;t have a lot of memory.<br />
And lets see what the battery life is.</p>
<p>no offense, but why would you want to put 1080p videos on the device? &#8230; while i do assume, it&#8217;s <strong>possible</strong> to spot the difference if you try <em>really</em> hard, is it really worth the double file size on such a small device?</p>
<p>Pretty much the same specs as a full sized laptop from a few years ago. Crazy.</p>
<p>This will be my next.</p>
<p>In Verizon site it says that ships by 11/19?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=6103" target="_blank">http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&amp;action=viewPhoneDetail&amp;selectedPhoneId=6103</a></p>
<p>Stupid Verizon.  I hate that I&#8217;m on them on contract now.  I do not want a 5&quot; One X+ &#8211; I want a One X+.  In white.  Not this gaudy red black crap.</p>
<p>Props for the on-screen buttons though.  Couldn&#8217;t see if there&#8217;s an RGB notification light?</p>
<p>Also &#8211; HTC is horrid about upgrades so as others have said, good luck on Android 4.2.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a total Apple fanboy and I gotta say (aside from that damned Verizon logo on the front) this is one seriously sexy piece of kit, inside and out. Really nice.</p>
<p>I prefer Android and I would recommend the iPhone 5 over this phone.</p>
<p>Excessive and gaudy. Nexus 4 is still the best android phone as of November 13, 2012.</p>
<p>The S3 makes a strong case for that spot.</p>
<p>Google&#8230; HTC&#8230;</p>
<p>Y U NO MAKE THIS NEXUS DEVICE?!?!</p>
<p>Damn that looks good. This could almost make me switch to Android.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t buy this! You&#8217;ve been warned! Former One X owner here, I was in love with HTC phones they still don&#8217;t have an update for us once you buy they could care less.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/28/3565358/htx-one-x-jelly-bean-asia-europe" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/28/3565358/htx-one-x-jelly-bean-asia-europe</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been more than two weeks, and still no update to 4.1 here in Norway. I keep refreshing :-(</p>
<p>Update profile/PRL (if applicable). I&#8217;m on Sprint so IDK.</p>
<p>But they look sooo good! I love the One X looks and feel.  Too bad about the updates&#8230; :-(</p>
<p>The whole wireless charging thing makes no sense to me, you can&#8217;t use the phone while it&#8217;s charging. I am constantly using my phone while it&#8217;s plugged in and charging.</p>
<p>exactly. you save like 1 second of plugging, but you cannot move the phone in any way. plus, it makes the phone heavier and the space could have been used for larger battery.</p>
<p>apple was smart not to do it</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Until they do it then it&#8217;s smart. Think of inductive chargers as docks without the speaker or clock.</p>
<p>They need to leave the option to still plug in and charge normally. I rather have had a bigger battery than the wireless charging in the dna</p>
<p>I guess this phone doesn&#8217;t have a microUSB port?</p>
<p>An Android phone without a microUSB port would be DOA.</p>
<p>What about an Android phone with a Lightning connector?</p>
<p>In 10 years, when everything is wirelessly charged and connected and you go to grab something that you actually need to plug in to work, I hope you remember back to your comment and think about how ludicrous it was.</p>
<p>make it black, release an international version and I am all in</p>
<p>I think it is international. Other people were saying it had quad GSM radios or something.</p>
<p>Contract is up in December, so this is a possibility. More likely I&#8217;ll get the Note II.</p>
<p>Biggest question mark for me here is the battery. Unless they did something cutting edge, I can&#8217;t see it as sufficient. And having gone through a lot of smartphones, I&#8217;d say battery is my top priority these days.</p>
<p>Looks great for a phone that will <strong>probably only ever receive ONE upgrade</strong> in it&#8217;s lifetime.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a logic in being entitled to updates. People that care about that would be replacing the phone at least every 18 months anyways.</p>
<p>Not of you buy a Nexus device.  I started on ICS on my GNEX and I&#8217;m up to JB.  iPhones get updates twice per year.</p>
<p>Verizon takes it&#8217;s sweet time crippling the device and forcing bloat to the point that they may release one update over two years&#8230; and that&#8217;s bullshit.</p>
<p>Stop drinking the Kool-Aid and expect more.</p>
<p>Bloat has little to nothing to do with updates&#8230;</p>
<p>OK if they&#8217;re not adding bloat then why do Android updates top VZW phones take so long?</p>
<p>Yes. I am serious.</p>
<p>*top = to</p>
<p>Because VZW likes to make sure there are no bugs in their OTAs?</p>
<p>BS&#8230; Why is it that software upgrades on identical phones on other carriers  happen AT MINIMUM twice as fast and are error free.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t think that adding their &#8220;special skins&#8221; and unremovable apps to Vanilla Android is what takes so long?  &#8230;Really?</p>
<p>You must be new to the game, son.</p>
<p>Not sure if serious&#8230;</p>
<p>4.1 is outdated on release. Good thing it has two gigs of RAM #trolling.</p>
<p>And most everyone who cares about this has already rooted.</p>
<p>Kinda wish these hardware manufacturers would use the on-screen navigation keys instead of the capacitive buttons.</p>
<p>The sad part is that HTC will still have a flop on their hands. They don&#8217;t market well. If you have this, the galaxy s III and the iphone all next to each other, people are gonna choose the samsung or iphone. 1080p is cool, and an amazing engineering feat. But, seriously, is it really necessary? Beats Audio is just dumb.</p>
<p>Tell that to all the people I know who have Beats headphones. I agree, but lots of people buy it.</p>
<p>I love this phone.</p>
<p>But Sense is not an option for me,</p>
<p>And so I&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>Till AOSP is an option for the phone.</p>
<p>Then the DNA will be the ONE for me.</p>
<p>Till then, I&#8217;ll wait.</p>
<p>Poetic.</p>
<p>Oh look, the new Droid Bionic! Let&#8217;s see how cool this phone is in 3 months.</p>
<p>The huge Verizon logo, the tacky red accents and the skin is any Verizon executive&#8217;s wet dream.</p>
<p>i dont mind the accents, the logo sucks though</p>
<p>It looks great, except for the storage-16GB is not enough, especially since Verizon now requires everyone to have tiered data plans.  If you are going to limit the amount of on-device storage then you should have unlimited data.  Otherwise, don&#8217;t carry phones that don&#8217;t have microSD storage expansion.  I shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about whether I&#8217;m near a wi-fi hotspot to access my own media.</p>
<p>I would bet that AT&amp;T will, at some point, not count the data used for accessing your media stored on their cloud storage locker against your data cap.  I&#8217;m also pretty sure Verizon will introduce their own cloud storage service soon with similar policies.  Obviously, this violates the principal of net neutrality, but the carriers obviously believe that  rules do not apply to them.  After all, if Comcast can get away with it&#8230;</p>
<p>Great, 1080 screen with over 400ppi. <br />
So the battery life will be like, what? 3:h24m?</p>
<p>Just ordered my Nexus 4. Too bad this phone is only for Verizon.</p>
<p>Just in time for my return to Japan&#8230;</p>
<p>Need a review through (mainly to see the battery life&#8230;)</p>
<p>I wish they would remove excess crap on the phone.<br />
• Verizon crappy logo<br />
• Beats audio logo<br />
• 4G LTE logo as if we need to be reminded</p>
<p>Yeah.  A Nexus phone doesn&#8217;t have any of that.</p>
<p>Except for the Sprint and VZW ones.</p>
<p>the nexus phone should say NO LTE, just as a reminder.</p>
<p>Battery tests will be interesting with only a 2020 mAh battery, 5&quot; 1080p screen, and LTE.    16GB seems small especially if Verizon dumps a bunch of bloat on it.</p>
<p>What happened to the One X and new beginnings HTC? Why isn&#8217;t this the One X Two or something?</p>
<p>The Two X</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even want to know the batterylife of this phone. HTC has never quite figured out what appropriate battery sizes are and 2020 mAh with such specs is just another big fail!</p>
<p>I think Verizon actually has a nice set of phones for once.  This, the GS3, the iPhone 5 and Galaxy Note 2.  Not a bad selection though I would like to see the LG Optimus or Nexus 4.</p>
<p>yawwwwnnn .. pretty phone &#8230; probably the same BS battery.. no thanks HTC .. EVER again</p>
<p>Incredible specs&#8230;..</p>
<p>A lot of love for the picture and video people. Too bad there&#8217;s so little storage on the phone to store the 1080p video that they&#8217;re touting.</p>
<p>Too bad this wasn&#8217;t the Nexus 4.  Although I realize Google wanted to wow everyone with price and there&#8217;s no way a 1080p screen could go for $300 unlocked.  At least the Nexus team now has a goal to shoot for next year.</p>
<p>Does any body have any details on Super LCD 3? I understand how IGZO works, but can&#8217;t seem to find anything describing its enhancements.<br />
As for the rest of this phone, it looks good. The only thing troubling is the battery which will be sealed. Well, of course, Sense&#8230;</p>
<p>I am all about pure nexus experience, but I am so tempted to switch to Verizon for this device. Especially after the horrible experience I had while buying nexus 4.</p>
<p>16 GB of storage will likely be a deal breaker for me&#8230;. it&#8217;s sad, really, because I would buy this if I could have at least 32 GB.</p>
<p>Oh, Android community, how I love thee.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m already unlocked does anyone know if Rooting would need me to wipe the device?</p>
<p>Rooting won&#8217;t wipe the device. But flashing the new ROM will.</p>
<p>Yea. Just want to make sure I remembered correctly. I&#8217;ll need to root then back up before I go all crazy&#8230;.</p>
<p>If I read correctly&#8230; this &#8220;ROM&#8221; is actually just a nandroid backup, so you don;t actually flash this rom just do a Nandroid Restore</p>
<p>Depends on the specific ROM but if it&#8217;s listed as &#8220;ROM&#8221; on XDA, then you wipe/flash like any other.</p>
<p>Jelly Bean is really awesome. The major changes are really in the background, it runs so much faster than ICS!</p>
<p>does it mean ICS was slow?</p>
<p>in context to Jelly Bean, yes ICS is slower!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t understand. ICS seemed really fast and fluid, but this feels much more polished.<br />
Also I don&#8217;t know if you guys have noticed, but Jelly Bean solves the yellow &#8220;tint&#8221; issue on Galaxy Nexus. The color looks much better now!</p>
<p>well i haven&#8217;t seen it. most who have use Jelly Bean on GNex are saying, it&#8217;s more smooth than ICS and animation are more fluid! not saying ICS was slow, but JB definitely seems faster!</p>
<p>Jelly Bean definitely added some colors tweaks, it looks a lot more true to color now.  For me it used to have a blueish hue compared to other displays but it&#8217;s far better now.</p>
<p>I noticed as well.  I guess the custom color values well all made to our Kernels will turn our screens yellow?</p>
<p>Because you just flashed a fresh ROM. Install some apps,  wait a couple weeks and then be reminded of the ever-present Android lag</p>
<p>This is different. Even after just flashing an ICS rom it didn&#8217;t run this smooth. All of the animations run smoother and more fluid.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get that?? What am I doing wrong I am on ICS too&#8230;.Maybe I just install good apps??</p>
<p>Not true. I installed all of my old ICS apps and it&#8217;s running really smoothly.</p>
<p>Actually, Mr. The Verge, LTE is working on the Verizon ROM:</p>

<p>Doh! And I have to wait until after 4:30 do put this baby on my phone. Curses!</p>
<p><a href="http://rootzwiki.com/topic/28473-rom-jds-jellybean-v2-everything-works/" target="new">It also works on this one which doesn&#8217;t need the SU patch.</a></p>
<p>I can confirm this as well. Heard of a wifi bug, bug flashed the fixed before I even booted. Everything is working just fone</p>
<p>I LOVE YOU, Devs! You all rock!</p>
<p>*just fine.</p>
<p>Oh, how I love thee, Galaxy Nexus. Downloading now..</p>
<p>it runs great on my nexus &#8211; tip:  for those outside of the USA, change your google now settings to search google.com instead of your home country. You still get local searches when you search, but now all the features of Google Now work correctly ( for instance, asking about what movies an actor was in, etc)</p>
<p>Does anybody know if Google Voice is working (not the voice search or Google Now, but the actual call/text forwarding capability) &#8211; this is the only thing for me that is absolutely essential. I have a ROM downloaded and ready to flash but can&#8217;t seem to find the answer :)</p>
<p>I am so very excited&#8230;I just flashed Cyanogen RC1 for the first time yesterday and love the color corrections and speed boost. I can&#8217;t WAIT to flash this baby</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason that it shouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Can this be flashed without root by renaming to &#8220;update.zip&#8221; and going to bootloader?</p>
<p>No, its probably not signed.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this will be on (or available) the Galaxy SIII? I pre-ordered with Verizon and it is supposed to ship July 9.</p>
<p>Sometime next year most likely. Galaxy s2 is more than ICS capable, and US carriers are just now rolling it out to the US Galaxy s2&#8217;s. Either put up with having ICS, or cancel your order and get a Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way it is. Sorry.</p>
<p>He said S3, not S2.  Samsung have essentially said Jelly Bean will hit the S3 because it did a spec-bump on the S3 once it got a sniff of Google&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<p>I am quite aware of what <strong>he</strong> said.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t get what <strong>I</strong> am saying. I am saying that he is at the mercy of US carriers, not Google. Samsung will take their sweet time designing a Touchwiz Jelly Bean Rom for the S3, then they will ship it off to Verizon, and then Verizon will sit on it for 4 months and figure out what kind of bloat they want to stick in the Rom, and then sit on it for another 2 months, and then roll it out to their subscribers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I am saying. Bypass the carrier and get a Nexus, and save yourself the headache.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t give it a spec bump because of jelly bean, anyone can read between those lines. They gave it a spec bump, because we ended up with a dual core Snapdragon S4, while overseas got the quad core Exynos beast. They had to compensate somewhere, more ram seemed to be the best way to reach that compromise.</p>
<p>The G3 International Version does not have any carrier restrictions.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t help that the OP is with Verizon, which is a CDMA US based carrier. US is always behind when it comes to Android OS rollouts, and the carriers are the primary reason to blame.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be realistic here&#8230;most all of the S3 variants will likely have a JellyBean ROM available to them within a month, if not sooner.</p>
<p>I actually have high hopes for the Transformer Prime getting a fast update because it seems the insides are actually rather similar with the Nexus7. Glad for the Galaxy Nexus owners though!</p>
<p>Running 4.1 all morning. The only hiccup I&#8217;ve had is that WiFi is unreliable. 4G is working great though, and Franco (well known kernel developer) already released a test kernel for JB which somewhat improves the WiFi signal strength. The speed and new features of JB are pretty awesome. Voice Recognition and Google Now are actually really awesome and useful. Just swipe up from the bottom of my screen and I get personalized info like weather, scores for my favorite teams, and what the traffic is going to be like on my commute home.</p>
<p>This is definitely going to be a great update for Android.</p>
<p>Theres a fix on XDA for wifi issues: <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1739097" target="_blank">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1739097</a></p>
<p>Well, I guess I&#8217;m gonna try to root for the first time. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to wait for Verizon again on this update.</p>
<p>Do it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been rooting for four years now &#8211; from the Eris, to the Incredible, to the Incredible 2 and now have settled on a GSM nexus.</p>
<p>Back up ALL the stuff on your nexus first as OEM UNLOCK tends to wipe the whole phone :)</p>
<p>Rooting isn&#8217;t bad, I believe xda-forums is the best place to start &#8211; maybe rootzwiki. I&#8217;m pretty sure there are some tools that make things really easy for you now &#8211; HAVE FUN and just follow directions. You&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p>I just installed Jelly Bean and&#8230; wow.</p>
<p>Wow is all I can say.</p>
<p>By far the best Android by any measure ever. The most surprising, the most glee inducing. Just wow.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot. I&#8217;ll definitely look into it. Everything I&#8217;ve seen with Jelly Bean looks like it&#8217;ll make my phone a lot better than it already is.</p>
<p>For anybody who is reading this, OEM unlock doesn&#8217;t <strong>tend</strong> to wipe the phone, it <strong>does</strong> wipe the whole phone. For security reasons or somesuch.</p>
<p>I knowwww but the risk. Ugh. Not even the risk just how long it takes and starting over etc etc.</p>
<p>There are two LTE ROMs which currently work.</p>
<p><a href="http://rootzwiki.com/topic/28486-team-liquid-vicious-toro-jellybean-fully-100-fucntional-deodexed-calls-wifi-data-3g-4g-etc-build-is-now-up/" target="_blank">http://rootzwiki.com/topic/28486-team-liquid-vicious-toro-jellybean-fully-100-fucntional-deodexed-calls-wifi-data-3g-4g-etc-build-is-now-up/</a> Which was the first to be released with everything working.</p>
<p><a href="http://rootzwiki.com/topic/28473-rom-jds-jellybean-v2-everything-works/" target="_blank">http://rootzwiki.com/topic/28473-rom-jds-jellybean-v2-everything-works/</a> Which was the first Toro build to boot up (but only worked on 3G and had no Root), but there was a quick Rev2 build uploaded which now allows LTE as well as SU.</p>
<p>Amazing that under a day after release there were two working LTE ROMs.</p>
<p>Not that any of the above matters to the average user, but I just like giving credit where it&#8217;s due.</p>
<p>Thank you @Paullie_Vicious &amp; the Liquid ROM team!</p>
<p>Flashed this morning and absolutely loving it so far. After the keynote yesterday I wasn&#8217;t sure which new feature I liked most, but now I can definitely say Project Butter is the best addition. It&#8217;s so incredibly smooth and fast and the animations look great. Overall it&#8217;s just amazing, couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with it!</p>
<p>I have installed Jelly Bean on my phone. It’s freaking awesome. Google Now understands my accent flawlessly whereas Siri really struggles with it, and is generally awesome. All the little changes Google have made to the OS are wonderful, like the back software button changing into a down arrow when the keyboard is up. The new notifications tray is a lot more stylish and functional. Android itself is blazing fast, ridiculously so. It&#8217;s the smoothest Android has ever been and it&#8217;s definitely on a par or even better than iOS now. It&#8217;s got some new animations for switching between apps now, that are incredibly fast and smooth. A lot higher frames per second. ICS seemed really responsive to me a few weeks ago when I first got my Nexus, but Jelly Bean takes it to a whole new level. I&#8217;m not sure if this is JB or just an update, but Google Music app has been redone (thankfully).</p>
<p>After all my bitching&#8230; I was floored to see that my Incredible S actually got updated to Android 4&#8230; Holy Mother of G!&#8230; Slightly less Fragmentation. This is Awesome!!</p>
<p>Now, about Screenshots.</p>
<p>&#8230;.. Power + Volume Down&#8230; Okay, I&#8217;ll shut up now</p>
<p>What the hell is an Icredible S?? Is that the incredible 2?</p>
<p>International Incredible 2 (GSM)</p>
<p>Does anyone know how large the download is? I&#8217;m on Chrome and it isn&#8217;t designating how large the file is.</p>
<p>The version I got was about 220mb, but that was a CWM flashable version.</p>
<p>Is Jelly Bean being released for the Nexus S?</p>
<p>Yes! Mid July from what I hear</p>
<p>Wait, if this is for the GSM Nexus, why is it on the Verizon Nexus section rather than the GSM Nexus section of the Rootzwiki forum? If i flash this rom for GSM Nexus, will it screw its baseband?</p>
<p>Separate ROMS for Verizon/GSM Nexus</p>
<p>Both versions seem to have working roms but USE THE RIGHT ONE</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t seem to find the other rom, can you direct me to the GSM rom?</p>
<p>So I guess I&#8217;ll have Jelly Bean running on my HD2 in just a few days.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Nexae</em>&#8221;? Get your Latin plurals right. &#8220;Nexus&#8221; is a 4th declension noun, so then the plural is <em>Nexus</em>, same as the singular. Had it been 1st declension, with which more people are familiar, it would get the standard &#8220;<em>Nexus, Nexi</em>&#8221; treatment.</p>
<p>Or you can use the English pluralization, <em>Nexuses</em>. But there&#8217;s no way it can ever be <em>Nexae</em>.</p>
<p>The people who try to use incorrect plurals here are probably the same that try to put Latin pluralization on Greek words.  So I&#8217;ll say <em>Nexodes</em> as a sort of linguistic revenge for <em>octopi.</em></p>
<p>It should be octopodes, correct?</p>
<p>Octopuses is, I believe, the preferred pluralization.  Octopi, like Nexae, is a pedantic overcorrection.  Also, like those words, it&#8217;s not correct since it&#8217;s an loan word based on older roots.  Loan words can wear the plurals of their adopted languages just fine.</p>
<p>I just installed this Jelly Beans rom. It unrooted my rooted device&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a patch on XDA that fixes this. Flash JB, flash the patch, and then flash the updated radios.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1737849" target="new">Link!</a></p>
<p>JB 4.1 is flipping awesome&#8230; Goodbye LAG!!! Almost if not  iOS-like now in smoothness. It&#8217;s actually nice to use now as a long time iOS/iPhone user (I have both).</p>
<p>The new notifications are very nice &#8211; finally more detail and can at a glance decide if there are important emails or if I can ignore til later. The camera seems faster &#8211; especially for reviewing pics. Google Now is interesting &#8211; but since I don&#8217;t live that close to a big city, it has limited usefulness until I travel. Currents is interesting. Basically a nice looking feeds app. New lock screen is cool &#8211; can now access camera direct.</p>
<p>Overall worth the upgrade and very stable too. Hasn&#8217;t crashed or done anything too weird yet.</p>
<p>Today is a glorious day.  Just received my OTA Jellybean upgrade from Google on my Galaxy nexus.  I live in Germany by the way.   Im now at peace.</p>
<p>4.1.2? Psshhh.</p>
<p>Bring on Key Lime Pie!</p>
<p>Google IO is 8 months away.</p>
<p>Nexus hardware can launch with a new Android build. It&#8217;s happened before.</p>
<p>Yes, Ice Cream Sandwich launched with the Galaxy Nexus last October, I believe.  Still KLP won&#8217;t be coming out for awhile.  Google&#8217;s rumored to be releasing 4.2 this month.</p>
<p>if 4.2 does come out, it would be called KLP.</p>
<p>It could still be Jelly Bean ie: Eclair 2.0/2.1 Honeycomb 3.0/3.1/3.2</p>
<p>True, It could go either way.  I have a hard time thinking KLP will be out this soon though.  Usually they incorperate a major OS change of some sort to be designated a new code name.</p>
<p>2.1- Elcair<br />
2.2- Froyo<br />
2.3 Gingerbread</p>
<p>It could go both ways, but now that Matias is running the show, KLP will be 5.&#215;. Can&#8217;t wait. Would that be a unified platform to incorporate Glass along with phones and tabs is my question.</p>
<p>We know that multi-user switching and a desktop mode is likely. This will coincide with ARM-based Ultrabooks.</p>
<p>No desktop mode, they have ChromeOS for that!</p>
<p>ChromeOS shares too much overlap with Android while still missing many required features (an expansive app catalog, for instance). It makes sense that sandboxed execution through NaCL is the future, but ChromeOS isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>Maybe a merging of ChromeOS and Android is on the horizon?</p>
<p>FYI, Native Client is abbreviated NaCl, with a lowercase L. It&#8217;s a pun on salt.</p>
<p>My bad; I noticed it as soon as I posted it, but there&#8217;s no edit functionality (yet!)</p>
<p>Actually, people have been reporting server logs that list 4.2 as JBXXX-something, which indicates that it could also just be named Jellybean.</p>
<p>Yes, with Duarte running the show, KLP will be 5.0 and that will be next year.</p>
<p>And, honestly, this makes so much more sense than every point upgrade being a new name.</p>
<p>Why?  There&#8217;s plenty of precedent for it.  I agree there hasn&#8217;t been enough consistency, but that doesn&#8217;t mean one arbitrary rule is better than another.</p>
<p>Yeah, a build id is so hard to fake.</p>
<p>Yes, but it makes much more sense for full point upgrades to be name-changers, rather than .X upgrades.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m betting the Nexus device(s) will launch with Jelly Bean 4.2</p>
<p>The next major version probably won&#8217;t see the light of day for months.</p>
<p>Since Jellybean was to Ice Cream Sandwich as Froyo/Gingerbread was to Eclair.. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see a name change with a newer Android version until I/O.  Just a version numbering difference with minimal changes to the OS.</p>
<p>I agree, I&#8217;m not 100% sure but I dont think a phone other then the Nexus has JB yet so I would guess Google wants the LG Nexus to be first to launch/have 4.2</p>
<p>What about the Galaxy Note Two and Galaxy S3 (Some variants.)? Dont they have JellyBean? (Albeit not stock)</p>
<p>Well, stock is really the only thing that counts to the everyday consumer.  But while the GS3 is still waiting (except apparently in Korea), the GN2 indeed has JB, stock.</p>
<p>To Blave&#8230; To Blave means to bluff.</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn&#8217;t help myself.</p>
<p>Ahhhh amazing. Thank you for this</p>
<p>I wonder if the performance updates are big enough to warrant a move back to stock from AOSP.  Though, as it stands, Nexus 7&#8217;s stock performance is pretty good.  It&#8217;s just not the best it can be.</p>
<p>Curiously, where does it fall short in performance?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean benchmarks, but actual usage issues with the performance of the device.</p>
<p>Well, with AOKP, I get very little stutters when switching through app pages or the homescreen.  Also, the Notification bar used to hiccup when being pulled down.  Once again, it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s slow, but it&#8217;s just not 100%, which is what I find AOKP to be.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t noticed the stuttering. I&#8217;m curious about the screen flickering though. Is that something that will be fixed with this software update?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a software update, it&#8217;s a custom ROM (AOKP)</p>
<p>Mine lags into oblivion when pinching to zoom in Chrome.</p>
<p>Agreed.  Chrome is and always has been slow as $(@! when scrolling or zooming &#8212; even on the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Chrome is probably the worst browser for the Nexus 7 em terms of performance. I recommend you to use the Boat Browser or the Dolphin Browser.</p>
<p>Depends on the website. Verge for example is indeed kinda slugish.</p>
<p>As much as I like Chrome on my laptop, it&#8217;s just not the same on the phone. Despite its better performance (especially with GIFs) than the stock browser, it stutters when pinching to zoom and it misses the kinetic scrolling which I absolutely love.</p>
<p>If Chrome were smoother and could scroll faster like the stock browser, I&#8217;d switch back. But for now, it&#8217;s stock for me. I&#8217;ve tried Dolphin and Firefox and Opera Mini and Mobile and Maxthon and I just prefer stock.</p>
<p>It has kinetic scrolling doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>I see a little lag sometimes on my unrooted N/7. So any performance enhancements are welcome.</p>
<p>Why deal with the hassle and random bugs if you have stock available to you?  I suppose experimentation is fun, but at the end of the day, I, personally, would want the stability.</p>
<p>Performance issues aside, the landscape mode is horrendous.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t take a anything to figure out that the 3 softkey buttons should be aligned left at the bottom and the notification bar should be at the bottom right. This is after all the natural resting position of  the fingers in landscape. The current implementation is clunky at best and requires moving the fingers off the bezel to use them.</p>
<p>That would be confusing as hell for users. In portrait its in phone mode then in landscape it switches to 10&quot; tablet mode? Thats crazier then how it is now.</p>
<p>Paranoid Android is for you (or AOKP, but Paranoid allows you set UI on a per app basis)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the entire point!  If your playing a fps and moving your thumbs around you don&#8217;t want to accidentally hit the home, back, or multitasking button by accident in the heat of battle!  There are many other use cases where the middle located buttons are far more ideal as you have to actually aim to hit them instead of by accident. <br />
I used to hit the home button all the time on my gnex instead of the space bar using the stock keyboard, I thought the app was crashing!  Once I put Swype on the problem has completely gone away, its even gone away with the stock keyboard once I got better at using it.<br />
I think the middle located buttons are ideal.</p>
<p>i wonder if this update will come to the GNex, and if so, being a Verizon customer, will I be subsisting on Social Security by then.</p>
<p>JBQ did not comment on releases to the GNex, Verizon or otherwise. I don&#8217;t anticipate this hitting the phones any time soon as the major revision is tablet specific. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d like to use a landscape UI on my GNex.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that sort of defeat the purpose of 4.0/ICS, to unify the tablet and phone builds?  In theory, anyway, there should not be a x.&#215;.1 revision out there that is specific to only one form factor.  And it&#8217;s not like you have to have all of the features activated on both tablets and phones.  Even on 4.1.1, the Xoom has landscape in the launcher, while the N7 and the Gnex do not.</p>
<p>I think she means that the update doesn&#8217;t need to be pushed as fast for the nexus phone, so we will most likely first get it in 1 to 2 weeks</p>
<p>Assuming landscape is just a tweak to the current profile, phones will continue to show the portrait mode only. The UI selection between 10&quot;, 7&quot;, and phone UIs was based on DPI and screen size. This has been the case since Honeycomb when it was discovered that running Honeycomb virtual images on phone screen dimensions switched the UI to a phone UI. I expect the update just relaxes the point where the switch from Tablet to Phablet to Phone takes place&#8230; or they&#8217;ve just allowed the Phablet UI to rotate and have a landscape view&#8230; I guess we&#8217;ll know for sure shortly.</p>
<p>The Gnex and NS4G are included in the changelog, so they will be getting the update.  If landscape homescreen is supported on the Gnex, I will be turning it off straight away.</p>
<p>I rather like it on mine (using Nova).</p>
<p>if an official update doesnt roll out, if youre on a custom ROM those will probably get updated to 4.1.2. Since its AOSP it should be pretty easy for ROM makers to put it on the GNex</p>
<p>First time having an android device that gets direct updates from google. I&#8217;m kinda liking it. No stress, no more ROMs.</p>
<p>very much, its nice to click &#8220;Check Update&#8221; yourself instead of reading about it.</p>
<p>This is why Google need to take more control over updates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s appalling that the Verizon Nexus isn&#8217;t updated directly from them.</p>
<p>While fandroid insists that getting ROM is super easy and stress free&#8230;</p>
<p>For many it is, but thanks for your input anyway.</p>
<p>On non-Nexus devices it can be a pain, especially when they have a locked bootloader. With a Nexus device, it&#8217;s actually really super easy to compile a ROM and unlock the Nexus, and flash it to the device.</p>
<p>Kinda ironic that the most ROM friendly devices don&#8217;t really need ROMs to be on the latest version.</p>
<p>This is why I buy Nexus devices. So good to get updates swiftly.</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s a Verizon device&#8230;</p>
<p>We got JB before 2013&#8230; I say that&#8217;s &#8220;swift&#8221; lol</p>
<p>or even worse, a Sprint device.</p>
<p>Sprint got the update weeks before Verizon.</p>
<p>Was thinking of the the Nexus S 4G and ICS&#8230;</p>
<p>But the fact that the Sprint Galaxy Nexus got JB 3 weeks before Verizon&#8217;s did shows you had terrible Verizon is when it comes to updates, because Google doesn&#8217;t even support the Sprint Galaxy Nexus in AOSP <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#" target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/forum/#</a>!msg/android-building/XBYeD-bhk1o/QMoqxhDJlk0J or host the factory images for it <a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images</a></p>
<p>Or a non-US device. Brazilian Galaxy Nexus, I mean &#8220;Galaxy X&#8221; (for legal reasons) owners &#8211; like yours truly &#8211; got 4.0.4 in August and are still waiting for Samsung to update their phones to 4.1.1.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to wait for Samsung&#8217;s build. The Galaxy Nexus in Brazil is just rebranded, and uses the same hardware as the international GSM version.</p>
<p>Just flash the stock images from Google, and you&#8217;ll be rocking Jelly Bean on that beast.</p>
<p>Currently on Bugless Beast. Love AOKP on my phone but this optimized stock I&#8217;m running on the tablet is awesome. Had landscape for awhile via Nova Launcher. Not sure if I want to go back to stock for this or just wait. Can anyone confirm if stock/rooted can still get the OTA?</p>
<p>Also running Nova launcher and it&#8217;s great.  The new landscape mode looks almost exactly like it, actually.  Just the search and mic buttons are switched top-to-bottom.</p>
<p>I remove the search and replace it with gestures. Two-Finger Clock-wise is voice search, Two-Finger Counter-Clock-wise is text search, very handy.</p>
<p>Why is a 2 finger gesture more convenient than a 1 finger tap?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not</p>
<p>It&#8217;s convenient to not have to use up the display space, if you want full screen widgets or a completely clean home screen.<br />
I use invisible folders and gestures on my gnex, so easy to navigate the screen one handed that way.</p>
<p>Any good tips on trying to force an update?</p>
<p>Be patient, we&#8217;ll have it soon enough. (I hate typing those words)</p>
<p>Landscape mode? Nice. Guess I know what I&#8217;ll be doing this afternoon–having a staring contest with my N7&#8217;s system update status.</p>
<p>Check for updates&#8230; tap&#8230; tap&#8230; tap&#8230; tap&#8230; tap&#8230;</p>
<p>Landscape? I&#8217;ve had landscape mode on my N7 since I got it. Maybe it was a feature of the launcher?</p>
<p>The stock launcher lacked landscape support until now.  Everything else was in landscape, though.</p>
<p>Uhm, I don&#8217;t think any Nexus 7 was shipped with landscape mode for the home screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.chzbgr.com/completestore/12/10/9/KcoSeT58lkWfEmPoRsIZ9g2.jpg" /></p>
<p>it&#8217;s a bit harsh (should be &#8220;confused&#8221; instead of &#8220;crazy&#8221;) but the meme (plus future caption) sure made it funny as hell.</p>
<p>There was no Landscape mode in the home screen (as the picture shows) until now.</p>
<p>Thank goodness. I keep watching the kid in front of me twist his head whenever he returned to the launcher when switching apps while his N7 is in landscape mode.</p>
<p>Sweet and I was just checking for updates last night</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t see the value of landscape, since the aspect ratio of the UI elements cannot possibly be maintained. After all, this isn&#8217;t a grid of icons. Widgets stand to be squashed and poorly rendered.</p>
<p>Most older tablets, almost all custom launchers, some phones have all had landscape, so I think it works fine. I had LauncherPro on my old Gingerbread phone, and thus landscape, and never had any problem with anything looking bad or being poorly rendered.</p>
<p>They also had a lot of dead space on the left and right edges so that when you rotated, the widgets looked the same. Third party launchers that allowed you to set your grid never rotated properly. But hey, if you&#8217;re homescreens are replete with icons, no problem. I use tons of widgets and I hate they way they rotate, such that my Tab10.1 is locked in portrait.</p>
<p>Forced portrait is irritating when you&#8217;re using the tablet in landscape and just want to go to home screen to launch an app.</p>
<p>Same on a phone. Sucks when I have my phone in my car dock. Good thing there is Nova Launcher, though I&#8217;d prefer not to use 3rd party launchers if possible.</p>
<p>Great.  So lock yours in portrait mode.  You&#8217;re happy and everyone else who likes landscape is also happy.</p>
<p>Be happy for mediocrity! woot!</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re talking about how your comments make you feel, right?</p>
<p>LOL. You&#8217;re funny :)</p>
<p>idk&#8230; i cant see many changes in JB&#8230; its the same as the ice cream was and some of my games are not working after the patch :/</p>
<p>Wow.. that took long enough..</p>
<p>Dang it. I bought ultimate rotation already.</p>
<p>Nice! Just turned on my tablet but I guess I wasn&#8217;t in the first batches. I&#8217;m a little excited for landscape mode. I have gotten so used to portrait, though, that I turned off auto-rotate. I&#8217;m going to have to unlearn this!</p>
<p>Love this device,  just great.</p>
<p>A quick observation I&#8217;d like to point out. There were 24 comments on this article over at Engadget with only 1 or 2 not being some kind of trolling. There are 34 comments here with only one being mild trolling. Thank you Verge readers for giving me another reason to find myself over there less and less.</p>
<p>Engadget trolling is really a terrible thing, I hope that we never come to that here.</p>
<p>Pretty much only straight up Apple bashing and name calling on all articles, just terrible.</p>
<p>Agreed. The comments section here is so much more mature, inforked, and when its time to be silly, funny. Not saying its perfect, but its better than engadget by lightyears. I just hope they don&#8217;t come over here</p>
<p>Did you count the author as a troll? Because Engadget writers like to feed the trolls.</p>
<p>I wish you guys had waited until 5:00 to post this!</p>
<p>BEWARE HIGHWAY DRIVERS OF THE EARTH</p>
<p>Want for Galaxy Nexus GSM.</p>
<p>One of the bugs fixed is a battery-drainer.  The Exchange Service goes nuts and pegs at 100% CPU until you reset the phone whenever the mail server goes down.  My work mail server goes down all the time (scaling issues) and I had to remove the Exchange account from my phone.</p>
<p>Once I get 4.1.2 I can put it back and have my work calendar show in the widget (yay).</p>
<p>So anyway on to meaningful comments, anyone with  Nexus 7 get this update? Anyone here who can answer in the comments?</p>
<p>Thanks Adi for spotting this by the way.</p>
<p>I got mine a while ago. Nothing special, without the landscape mode you wont even notice it.</p>
<p>No performance improvements? Enhancements to Project Butter? Though I suppose that&#8217;ll come with 4.2</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give it a thorough shake down after work, it&#8217;s already very smooth maybe I should be looking more closely.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>No noticeable speed improvements, must be a bunch of under the hood improvements and the added landscape mode. Nothing else of significance to report.</p>
<p>Cool, thanks again.</p>
<p>Hopefully it gets rid of the occasional touch lag and speeds things up even more, guess we shall see.</p>
<p>Just installed it on my stock rooted N7 (Thanks XDA!).  Landscape works and was plenty fast prior to the upgrade so I don&#8217;t  notice any speed improvements.  Titanium backup shows newer versions of..<br />

<p>So people buy Nexus devices for stock android and timely updates but they root them to put custom roms on them. Lmao. I&#8217;m not laughing at people who do but I&#8217;m laughing because I thought I was obsessive about having the best performance possible but I&#8217;m clearly not at that level.</p>
<p>Not speaking for everybody but I can tell you that I rooted and flashed mine with custom ROMs because I have <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/announcements/do-you-have-obsessive-rom-updating-disorder-ord/">ORD</a>.</p>
<p>Well there are the people who buy them because they want timely updates, and then there are the people who buy them, because they are so easy to root, and have the best custom ROM support.</p>
<p>Exactly right!</p>
<p>Is this going to fix my shitty touchscreen?  Because otherwise I really don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering if the might resolve the phantom typing issue?  I haven&#8217;t confirmed, through web searches, if this is a hardware or software issue.</p>
<p>what is phantom typing issue?</p>
<p>Search &#8220;Nexus7 phantom typing&#8221;.  There are youtube vids of this.  The device will open and close apps without user input.  The search bar (at the top of the screen) will open, and random letters will input, then the search closes&#8230;then opens again.  Very strange, and annoying.</p>
<p>Are you talking about the issue where when you&#8217;re typing into search, it starts typing letters on its own? I have that issue, too. Very annoying. So far, the only fix is disabling auto-complete.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has to do with the Google search bar and how it types on its own.  But mine also opens and closes apps on its own.  The search bar will open and start typing, then close&#8230;then settings will open and close&#8230;then some other app will open and close.  Its very annoying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a ghost, not a hardware or software issue.</p>
<p>Bug fixes good<br />
landscape = meh<br />
ParanoidAndroid = Yes</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the UK and I haven&#8217;t been lucky enough to receive the update yet. Looking forward to landscape mode.</p>
<p>Now guys on varizon again go waiting&#8230;. :)</p>
<p>That photo looks like a rotation launcher. Won&#8217;t be happy if it&#8217;s the real deal.</p>
<p>No update yet, and the screen does suck, I have to put it to sleep constantly, and when trying to use it outside with an ambient temp of 80 or above, its useless.</p>
<p>Not sure where all this negativity is coming from. I&#8217;m glad they fixed the landscape mode. Wasn&#8217;t sure they&#8217;d do something about it, because it seemed like a conscious decision.</p>
<p>Still haven&#8217;t gotten mine</p>
<p>Patiently (not really) waiting for the update. Landscape&#8217;s gonna be nice for multi-tasking at night.</p>
<p>I really wish they made the onscreen buttons along the short side of the display in landscape mode, like on the phone. Landscape mode on the N7 is so cramped vertically.</p>
<p>Wow landscape mode looks like a TOTAL MESS.  When I got the Nexus 7 I was vexed as to why there was no landscape mode.  Now I see why lol.  Take it back!</p>
<p>Considering the slow-to-inprove state of updates for non-Nexus devices, I hope Google&#8217;s entry in the 7-inch tablet club with the Nexus 7 will make waves in a way that devices like the Galaxy Nexus and its predecessors were unable to, amongst the dominate landscape of non-Nexus devices that range across carriers who, lets face it, never fail to slow down progression, if they can help it.</p>
<p>We can hope, at least, it will only get better. In the tablet space, we can certainly feel—and welcome—the lack of carrier presence.</p>
<p>In any case, as Nexus 7 owners begin receiving this update (this N7 owner is still waiting), we are living the &#8216;good life&#8217; that the Nexus program promises, and it&#8217;s my hope that the positive ownership experience that comes with swift—and unexpected—updates will  be recognized as something worth working harder to match by the platform as a whole.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 was this Apple fan boy&#8217;s first dip into the Android pool, and with continued progress in areas like update readiness and following Android&#8217;s recent emphasis on raising its bar for tablet user experience expectations, my previous reservations are being met with a satisfaction that has me thinking I&#8217;ll be sticking around.</p>
<p>Only two fixes I am hoping for: Nexus 7 becomes extremely slow if memory gets close to full, and touchscreen stops working unless I tap off button.</p>
<p>They should add portrait orientation for the home screen with an orientation lock for phones (ie the Galaxy Nexus) too. Here&#8217;s hoping! Then I don&#8217;t have to use a 3rd party home screen (nova launcher).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s that weather/clock widget? From the Play store? Or is it hacked on from an HTC phone/tablet?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the beautiful widgets app. In it&#8217;s most basic form it looks like the HTC clock widget, but it has so many skins and customizable parts. I personally use one on my N7 that uses the Roboto font and has no borders so the numbers and weather info just look like they are part of the background. Needless to say, it&#8217;s pretty slick.</p>
<p>It seems the Jelly Bean notification bar actions were updated in 4.1.2.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6dzMzklEd4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6dzMzklEd4</a></p>
<p>Still waiting for the update to be available for me on my Nexus 7&#8230;. I somehow always end up on the back end of a software update roll out&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting as well and I guess it will take a while because I have a German version.</p>
<p>Update arrived. Loving the landscape feature.</p>
<p>I want to live in a single ecosystem.  If Google merges Chrome OS and Android and releases it on the Desktop, I&#8217;d consider switching.</p>
<p>Next <strong>year</strong>? Ouch.</p>
<p>Lol, by the time they release it we will probably already have Keylime Pie</p>
<p>I/O isn&#8217;t till May</p>
<p>Nobody says they will release before or after, just the time will say.</p>
<p>is it weird that I actually want this phone?</p>
<p>Yes.  Shameful. How do you sleep at night?</p>
<p>They need a new naming strategy. Saying that, everyone does.</p>
<p>Oh wow that&#8217;s bad.</p>
<p>Knowing LG, those statements are not etched in stone so&#8230;</p>
<p>Just wait for the LG Nexus.</p>
<p>LG, ladies and gentleman.</p>
<p>The nice thing about the tablet leaking so early is his post has already been written.</p>
<p>Heh, true, it does feel like this was less an announcement and more of a confirmation.</p>
<p>For anyone that missed the keynote, I&#8217;m uploading the video of the announcement currently. In the meantime, here are some screen captures I took from the recording.</p>

<p>And if you missed the video stream of the keynote:</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/dJGiEQgaZYs" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/dJGiEQgaZYs</a></p>
<p>No Canada love? Google had such an awesome opportunity to capture the sub-$200 tablet market here (which is currently ruled by only the <strong>cough</strong> playbook <strong>cough</strong>) but they blew it.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>Why would they want to own the lowest margin section of the market?</p>
<p>Because, to them, market share is more important than profit at this point in time.</p>
<p>Increase market share, more people will develop for the platform, which will enable the higher end part of the market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not about to spend $500 on an Android tablet.  The Android tablet ecosystem is not worthy of spending that kind of money on one.</p>
<p>But this, for $200?  I have a Kindle Fire, but I&#8217;m probably going to buy this the day it becomes available.  I prefer the 7&quot; size, and at a low weight, with the latest version of Android, and what appears to be a decent screen for the money, it&#8217;ll do what I expect a cheap tablet to do &#8211; and perhaps a bit more.</p>
<p>Okay, they confirmed it; Nexus 7 IS coming to Canada and UK in addition to the US.</p>
<p>What about the apps? Or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Does the Kindle Fire have an edge on the Android ecosystem?</p>
<p>Nope, except for tighter integration with amazon services. Which is why neither is very compelling.</p>
<p>Why do you think the emphasis is on media consumption? Because that helps cover the perception of Android tablet apps.</p>
<p>You mean the ~600,000 apps?</p>
<p>Yes, tablet apps are lacking.</p>
<p>This is because tablet apps haven&#8217;t been doing well, so developers don&#8217;t have much reason to design for the tablet rather than the phone.  This is why they are pushing for market share &#8211; so that they can get some tablet development going, and make the fancier tablets worth buying.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a 7&quot;, 3/4lb tablet with modern hardware, good performance, and some tablet applications in addition to a good web browsing experience, and a very low price is a very nice looking proposition.</p>
<p>Totally agree. This is a smart move. I have never been interested in any sort of Android tablet &#8211; those Samsung wannabe things make no sense to me &#8211; uglier than an iPad, for the same price, with a toy OS and no apps? why?</p>
<p>But this for $199 with what looks like a great screen, and no lag (new to Android: No lag. Only took 4 versions&#8230; but whatever). Some games. At the price, this is great.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think apple would make a 7&quot; tablet&#8230; now I kinda do.</p>
<p>Because the product itself means jack shit ultimately, other that Google wanting to drive manufacturers to minimum standards. They don&#8217;t make profits on the device, they make profit off the users of Android using Google&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>There is a huge market for sub $200 tablets, and no the margins aren&#8217;t great on the hardware, but to Google that means jack squat.</p>
<p>Yeah, we miss out once again. Also looks like we can&#8217;t buy that $349 Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Confirmed: Nexus 7 IS coming to Canada.</p>
<p>If you go to the preorder page it should automatically localise the price and everything for you. I was very surprised that it showed me the Australian price and let me order. This <em>never</em> happens, so Kudos Google. I just might start saving for this baby.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the Australian price? I&#8217;m in China at the moment and just get a big old &#8220;nope&#8221; page.</p>
<p>Video is private</p>
<p>This <em>is</em> coming to the UK, right?</p>
<p>This HAS to have international roll-out, surely?</p>
<p>US, Canada and UK, yes.</p>
<p>This thing is ugly!</p>
<p>Who cares. It is useful</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s useless compared to an iPad.</p>
<p>Keep on trolling&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also half the price.</p>
<p>Smart move by Google to <strong>not</strong> go head to head with the iPad and instead focus on making their own widget.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t you mean making their own niche?</p>
<p>Surely it&#8217;s Amazon&#8217;s niche?</p>
<p>Not anymore?</p>
<p>While there are very few tablet apps, the point of this <em>developer</em> device is to entice devs by its low price so they&#8217;ll start making tablet apps for it.  Pretty smart move.</p>
<p>And comments that are one-liners don&#8217;t add anything to the conversation, and serve to game a group of people&#8217;s needs for a little rubbin&#8217; and tuggin&#8217;. You move beyond shooting the shit when you lay down what you know. Although, I&#8217;ll meet you half way, given how Android tablets have sold in the past, and how poorly the Google prepared developers for a 3.0+ world this thing isn&#8217;t going to compare to the iPad. However, there&#8217;s definitely a market for tablets at this price-point. Used TouchPad&#8217;s still fetch a couple bills because they&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;m sorry Amazon, the best quality for the price. Companies have a real problem keeping devices from coming back because consumers wont bend on build quality and performance very much. As long as Nexus 7 is a marked improvement over the Fire it&#8217;s got a chance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got some real reservations about Tablets because this shit&#8217;s going down very mp3 player. Apple changed the narrative from creating a utility to a consumer electronic, and the OEMs weren&#8217;t able to respond because that wasn&#8217;t their game. There&#8217;s a difference though,  Android&#8217;s got a huge loyal fan base who&#8217;ve got the money to early adopt en masse, and I&#8217;m sure they would rather be treated like consumers by developers instead of animals they can farm for ad impressions. As long as shit hasn&#8217;t gone all PepperPad on Goolge I think there&#8217;s consumer appetite to create a little sub-category. Not a direct competitor of the iPad, but something a little different.</p>
<p>Surprised its a plain jane design from ASUS,  they can do better than this. Still needs a rear camera IMO and the thick border frame around the display is just obnoxious. Spec wise its mos def a one-up from the Fire though.</p>
<p>Who wants this ? You should have bought a Kindle Fire already.</p>
<p>Lets think hard about what you just said. You compared a pretty weak/old (and did i mention hot) dual core tablet with pretty much no sensors that&#8217;s locked down to Amazon&#8217;s limited content pool to a smooth as butter quad core tablet with a full suite of proper sensors that is open for you to use as you wish and has access to googles crazy big appstore.</p>
<p>The fire just got served it&#8217;s death sentence.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s app store, AND Google&#8217;s killer apps like GMail, Drive, Currents, and of course Play store.</p>
<p>Shut up and take my money!</p>
<p>Death sentence? Amazon can sell ice to an Eskimo. Even if it&#8217;s an inferior product, I doubt its going to put in much of a dent in Fire sales. Not to mention we&#8217;ll probably get a new version this year.</p>
<p>I think Google&#8217;s going to discover that most people wish to use their 7&quot; tablet like a Nook or a Kindle Fire. I think you&#8217;re going to discover that most people don&#8217;t know what a sensor is.</p>
<p>But they sure are going to notice it when the tablet rotates smoothly and can do bluetooth! Even on CM9 the Kindle Fire&#8217;s turning is a bit jerky.</p>
<p>HAHAAHAHHAA!!!! That&#8217;s hilarious!</p>
<p>Why does everyone feel the need to do those nauseating Apple-style videos with the company execs? That tone acting like they&#8217;e saving the world and agonising over every curve of each and every atom?</p>
<p>Because people have been going to Apple for ideas since the 80s.  Just ask Bill Gates.</p>
<p>And for money when their company is flailing.</p>
<p>I thought people got over this mindset once they grew up.</p>
<p>What mindset?  Truth?  Justice?</p>
<p>Growing up means you care less, and less about this stuff, get greedy, get brainwashed by TV and become a selfish Republican Baby Boomer?</p>
<p>Oh of course, worship billionaire thugs.</p>
<p>What in the world are you talking about?</p>
<p>Wow, I don&#8217;t even know what to say.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_982w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/07/20/Business/Images/stevejobs-microsoft-97.jpg" /></p>
<p>I liked it. Then again, I also love my iDevices. So I guess &#8230; it worked.</p>
<p>See it&#8217;s obviously different from Apple videos, the color tone is different (more color), the shirts are more crumpled&#8230; in fact they&#8217;re so consistent with their message I can&#8217;t help but think they spent an epic amount of time on those shirt crumples. They&#8217;re trying very hard to pretend they just walked to people&#8217;s offices and had a chat.</p>
<p>Why do people always feel the need to call them &#8220;apple style&#8221;. Companies have been doings videos like this for years from everything to high performance cars and trucks to marquee chronographs (watches). <br />
The same goes for the &#8216;&#8217;making of&#8217;&#8217; videos, I grimace every time i hear J Tops say that a company is doing it apple style, being that I&#8217;ve seen car manufacturers do this for decades longer than Apple.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t you know? apple created everything thus everyone copies them!</p>
<p>Apple was the first to consistently show them at <em>consumer technology</em> product launches. Before these became trendy the norm was those abstract ridiculous &#8220;razr flying through the screen at your face&#8221; videos. It&#8217;s foolish to say that all the other tech companies decided to copy car manufacturers after apple decided to copy car manufacturers.</p>
<p>if this is 200, i tell myself to not buy, must wait for windows 8, but this is SOOO TEMPTING, why google why, i might just lose 200$ now.</p>
<p>Great but useless for me without 3G.</p>
<p>3G makes products worse in the US.  Anything with 3G either costs $200 more or requires a huge contract.</p>
<p>Except for the iPad. It&#8217;s $130 more and no contract.</p>
<p>Only Apple can get that kind of deal. Every other tablet with 3G is sold by the carrier with a contract.</p>
<p>Wow. I didn&#8217;t realise the situation was quite that bad.</p>
<p>When all it&#8217;s navigation can be setup for offline use is no 3g really that big a deal?</p>
<p>No 3G/4G! I was surprised at first but I think it is ok, for the price&#8230; Still having the option to pay more for 3G/4G would have been better.</p>
<p>I like this. My 2 year old always wants to watch Netflix on my iPhone or laptop. Now I can give her one of these.</p>
<p>Your 2 year old knows how to use Netflix?</p>
<p>He/she sounds like a pretty badass 2 year old</p>
<p>My two year old knows how to use Netflix on our Kindle Fire and Netflix on our Roku. But he still wants to use my iPad. He knows which device is better and wasn&#8217;t fooled when I said here use this, and handed him the Kindle Fire.</p>
<p>Basically just killed the iPod Touch there.  Might buy one for tinkering with at that price.</p>
<p>This is definitely better than the Touch. For sure.</p>
<p>Except the touch is a PMD that fits in your pocket? Where do you guys get these comparisons?</p>
<p>This will fit into your jacket pocket.</p>
<p>I live in SoCal, I don&#8217;t wear a jacket.</p>
<p>Sucks to be me (in London, jacket advised for 50 weeks of the year).</p>
<p>Preferably waterproof.</p>
<p>(another damp Londoner here)</p>
<p>Whose fault is that?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a jacket big enough to carry this around in plus again this is going after the Kindle Fire not the iPod touch. The touch is the gateway drug for pre-teens whose parents can&#8217;t afford/don&#8217;t want to buy them a $200 smartphone.</p>
<p>Fair points.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just thinking about which I would rather buy if I had $200 and the nexus 7 definitely wins. This is coming from someone who was that teenager pining over an iPod touch a few years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about size.  It&#8217;s about functionality.  Both this and the iPod touch serve the same role (namely an internet browser and gaming device) and I can assure you that at the same price point customers will chose between the two.</p>
<p>They are competitors because there is no reason to own both.</p>
<p>This is definitely not competing the in same market&#8230;the overlap in target demographic is small.</p>
<p>Also, all smartphones are killing the iPod Touch&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>Also, all smartphones are killing the iPod Touch…</blockquote>
<p>Smartphones aren&#8217;t really competing with the iPod Touch.</p>
<p>The Touch is for people who want most of the benefits of a smartphone without nearly as many of the fees and obligations.</p>
<p>Yes, obviously&#8230;but many many people who would have otherwise bought an iPod touch now have smartphones and hence have no need for another pocketable touchscreen device.</p>
<p>Hence, smartphone sales are soaring while iPod sales are dwindling fast&#8230;</p>
<p>As long as there are people out there that wish to live without contracts, the market will always be there for devices like the iPod Touch.  I mean, if the Touch wasn&#8217;t selling Apple wouldn&#8217;t be offering it.  Look at the Classic, which is probably in an even worse shape than the Touch, but Apple still offers it, even as they axe the 17&quot; MBPro.</p>
<p>Obviously&#8230;.but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is not competing in the same market. Smartphones, especially the iPhone itself, are no doubt cannibalizing iPod Touch sales.</p>
<blockquote>the overlap in target demographic is small.</blockquote>
<p>They have the exact same demographic.  There is almost no reason to own both.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they killed it, since it&#8217;s too big to put in a pocket.</p>
<p>Wait, you&#8217;re forgetting that Apple could pull a Nintendo and do an iPod XL with a 7&quot; iPod touch!  :)</p>
<p>Apple will not do a 7&quot; tablet.</p>
<p>I think Apple would make an end to iPod Touch and release something like iPad-Mini.</p>
<p>I just went nuts seeing last year iPod line-up , because 2011 marked 10th anniversary to iPods.<br />
So i am very sure , that they are going to do something with iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Think about this folks: this is a solid device to push your Google ecosystem to if you want to experiment with another platform for your next smartphone upgrade.</p>
<p>Curious about Windows Phone 8? Here&#8217;s a 7&quot; device, fully supported by Google with the latest OS updates, for a price at half the retail of a current-gen Android smartphone. Grab this and a WP8 device later this year and you can get your feel of a different platform WITHOUT losing your access to an ecosystem you might be invested into to the point of lock-in.</p>
<p>wp8=windows 8, but this might be a great compliment to the both of those.  i might consider buying this now.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s the Windows 8 kernel, sort of, but yeah, that&#8217;s the idea. If you&#8217;re locked into Android and feel obligated to keep buying Android smartphones as a result, you don&#8217;t have to anymore. You can get a very cheap coffee-table tablet now, keep a solidly-performing consumption device with access to the ecosystem you&#8217;ve trapped yourself into, and granting yourself the freedom to try something different from your carrier.</p>
<p>i just might have to own a surface pro, new gaming desktop and now the nexus 7.</p>
<p>*complement</p>
<p>Bring it on Kindle Fire 2.</p>
<p>Pass</p>
<p>Yeah, Ill pass because I already have the Fire w/ ICS and a newish laptop and the Surface Pro is looking like my next.  If I wanted a cheap tablet today, this would be it though.</p>
<p>Available in the UK. Awesome!</p>
<p>Exactly. With no decent Amazon ecosystem here, this has got in before the Fire</p>
<p>Does this have and SD slot on it?</p>
<p>Nope. Disappointed.</p>
<p>Very much an amazon competitor.  Google is wising up in trying to take on the iPad.</p>
<p>Okay never mind, I actually want to buy this.</p>
<p>Gonna buy one. There&#8217;s no reason anyone would want a Kindle Fire now, at least not for Android users.</p>
<p>Exactly&#8230;get the Kindle App and you have a better tablet with much better software for the same price.</p>
<p>Who wanted a Kindle Fire in the first place?</p>
<p>Just kidding.  Calm down.</p>
<p>Wrong, unless Amazon plans to make their VOD service available to Android in general, the only way to get that is with the Fire.</p>
<p>Or the browser&#8230;</p>
<p>Yep, any browser with Flash will do.</p>
<p>You can just copy the apk, you know.</p>
<p>The apk is very fickle and doesn&#8217;t work on ICS devices.</p>
<p>This thing is actually running the phone UI instead of Android&#8217;s tablet interface. What are they thinking? It&#8217;s like those crappy Froyo tablets all over again.</p>
<p>Anyone else notice that the Google Nexus HSPA+ has gone down in price to $350? Woot! :D</p>
<p>Time to put the hp touchpad for sale, google nexus here i come!</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve been nursing mine along for awhile too.  Time to get rid of it.  :(</p>
<p>even though the screen is smaller, no more hassle for trying to get newest android version on the device, and this nexus 7 has tegra 3 vs snapdragon s3!</p>
<p>Ordered.</p>
<p>Sign me up!</p>
<p>We can of course always go back to pre-2000 keynotes&#8217; style</p>

<p>He is so awful in front of a crowd.  Balmer has almost zero charisma.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Apple products, but I&#8217;ve never seen skydiving at Apple&#8217;s keynotes.  Definitely some strong differences here, though one of Google&#8217;s execs seemed to be trying to channel Steve Jobs with his longish dark hair and &#8220;praying hands&#8221; gesture and his choice of words &#8212; maybe not trying, but for a minute I thought I was watching a young version of Jobs.</p>
<p>My impression of the Nexus 7 is &#8220;this is what the Kindle Fire should have been&#8221;.  The 16GB option is the clear choice since 8GB is not even enough for my kids iPod Touches (I had to sell their 8GB ones and upgrade them to 32GB since they don&#8217;t offer a 16GB version).  Movies, magazines, interactive digital books, and apps (especially games) take storage space.  If you add offline music storage then 8GB is not even worth the $50 savings.  The 16Gb $249 version makes this a stellar content-consumption device &#8212; the exact market Amazon tried to capitalize on.</p>
<p>iPad does this stuff (and much more), but I can see this device opening up the &#8220;media tablet&#8221; to a large group of people who would have never spent $400 on an iPad 2.  That was the same thing I said with the Fire, but its inferior storage and lack of parental controls on launch and really bad reviews stunted its growth in the market.  I think Google and Asus have put together the perfect answer to the Fire.</p>
<p>So basically this is the Google Kindle Nexus Fire 7&#8230; err the Play Nexus. Can this thing do anything that has nothing to do with Google Play? That&#8217;s all they mention?!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a 7&quot; Android phone with no phone or connectivity. The Google Play stuff appeared to be a bunch of homescreen widgets you can just delete, though that wasn&#8217;t entirely clear.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a 7&quot; iPod Touch?</p>
<p>:jumps off bridge:</p>
<p>Just give us an international launch schedule!</p>
<p>They honestly should have marketed the Q as part of the tablet. Then it would have been awesome. Or they should include the Q with the next Nexus phone.  At $299 though, the Q is a rip off when you can get an Apple TV or Patriot box office or WDTV for like around $100 or less.</p>
<p>Hard to not be interested at that price point.</p>
<p>Holy huge bezel Batman!</p>
<p>Is this US only or what?</p>
<p>Smart move &#8211; create a useful, beautiful, fast, little tablet for $200. Which is useful in its own right. And <strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong> even try to compete with the iPad. I might buy one of these just for the fact that it&#8217;s cheap, and for the smoothness.</p>
<p>I see this as establishing a beachhead for Android tablets, and a new reference design for performance of course.</p>
<p>Because Android people always claim there&#8217;s no issue with performance, I tried out two devices in the store recently: The Galaxy Nexus,  Galaxy S3 and a Galaxy S2 (which they still sell here) &#8211; on both the S2 and the Nexus, the slide to unlock thingy on the home screen was visibly and <strong>badly</strong> stuttering. On the S3, the wave ripple effect was smooth. About time is all I can say.</p>
<p>Second thought: Sorry MS Surface VaporWare. You are deader now than ever. This is Android getting serious about tablets and going about it in a very smart way. While this poses a small threat to the iPad, it outright kills W8.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see:<br />
- Google Nexus 7 : $200, for those who want a tablet but don&#8217;t want to spend much<br />
- Apple iPad (latest version) : $500, for people who like to spend and Apple fans (and many businesses now as well)<br />
- MS Surface : Probably $600 or more&#8230; not sure who will buy this.</p>
<p>- Google Nexus 7 : $200, for those who want a tablet but don’t want to spend much<br />
- Apple iPad (latest version) : $500, for people who like to spend and Apple fans (and many businesses now as well)<br />
- MS Surface : Probably $600 or more… for the many people who haven&#8217;t bought a tablet yet due to not having a viable reason to buy an oversized iPod touch (toy). Surface Pro with Windows 8 will be bought by people who will want to do more than just media consumption</p>
<p>Not having a go at Android at all, these looks like a great deal. But I will pass and happily pay more for a premium product that replicates the full Windows experience. What more could you ask for?</p>
<p>Dunno&#8230; I would think that for &gt;$600, one would probably buy a full laptop if one wants more than media consumption. That is why I think it may be difficult to sell. Apparently, MS is gunning to replace netbooks and lower-end laptops with this&#8230; it could work, but not sure if it will.</p>
<p>£159 &amp; £199!!!</p>
<p><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6af3kHAnc1qmsm1zo1_1280.jpg" /></p>
<p>I know!  Really, really competitive pricing!  The UK always seems to get inferior price conversions so I expected $199 would = £199 but Google &amp; Asus have done a great job keeping the price down!  There&#8217;s really no excuse for buying a cheap Chinese Android tablet now!</p>
<p>Btw nice how you timed the screenshot with the email notification &#8211; thumbs up!</p>
<p>This has me intriguied. It&#8217;s cheap and from the looks of it much faster than the kindle with the entire Google store at your disposal. It ain&#8217;t gonna replace my iPad, but the device will fit in perfectly as a cheaper offering. 200$ is nothing compared to what it is offering. However I would have loved to see which OS the thing is running&#8230; I just hope it&#8217;s the tablet OSsince then the developers will create some neat apps for it&#8230; The tablet offerings are pretty slim pickings compared to the massive iPad library.</p>
<p>it better be fast&#8230;..it has a tegra 3 and 4.1&#8230;&#8230;they empahised &#8216;no lag&#8217; in 4.1</p>
<p>emphasized*</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t really a different OS, there&#8217;s just different layouts depending on the size of the screen.  It&#8217;s up to the app developers to decide if they want to build an app with a tablet UI on it.</p>
<p>I was pretty shocked by that, too.  I have to assume they did the math and realized that while they can get away with a subsidized price on a tablet with heavy media consumption potential, they can&#8217;t do the same on the streaming device.  Still not sure where all that Q money is going though&#8230; my WD Live cost me $100 like 2 years ago, and it can stream all day long PLUS has USB for external storage.  Apple TV (or whatever they call it) has like 80% of these features at 1/3 the price.  The &#8220;social&#8221; aspect is kinda convenient (assuming I can keep my girlfriend from hijacking it during Black Hawk Down to play another episode of Supernatural), and I could see people who don&#8217;t own quality stereo equipment using the built-in amp, but to me none of that equals 3x the cost.</p>
<p>If anything, imagining the possibilities is pushing me more towards an Apple TV.</p>
<p>Oy, I&#8217;m so worked up I can&#8217;t even hit &#8220;reply&#8221; on the right post!</p>
<p>If you wanted a Google device for the TV, get the Vizio Co-Star Google TV. $99.</p>
<p>And how in their right mind do they price a full featured tablet at 200$ and price a media streamer for 300$&#8230; WTF Google?!!!</p>
<p>The tablet is made in Taiwan/China and the streamer in the US :D</p>
<p>Still can&#8217;t play FF tactics on this&#8230; Come on google. Go ask square enix to put FFTactics on it</p>
<p>i&#8217;ll buy it in bulk it is cheap</p>
<p>Is the Nexus 7 open to other content sources <del>-</del> Amazon Appstore, Amazon MP3, Kindle, Spotify, Netflix, Nook, etc..? Amazon can afford to subsidize the Fire because it locked it to the Amazon ecosystem. But if the Nexus 7 is open to other sources, then Google&#8217;s Play store  will see a lot of competition.</p>
<p>Yes to all those apps except maybe Nextflix.  Netflix usually adds new devices upon release, but Asus lately has been preloading it on their Prime&#8217;s, so I would bet it will work on the Nexus.</p>
<p>Ehm, sorry but this thing isn&#8217;t ugly at all. Compared to other tablets with price/quality, is this awesome!</p>
<p>Just bought one and a cool cover. So exciting!</p>
<p>i&#8217;m buying this as soon as possible</p>
<p>Bought it in 16gb with cover and extra power outlet.  :)  Great deal!</p>
<p>Order an 8GB! Bargain. :D</p>
<p>No MicroSD on these Nexus devices really kills my interest. You&#8217;re not always connected to wi-fi, and even a decent sized media library would eat up 16GB.</p>
<p>The 25$ bonus &#8211; only one for an account, or multiplied by the amount of ordered tablets?<br />
Can I order e.g. three Nexus&#8217; 7 and choose  three accounts to receive a $25 each?<br />
I&#8217;m from Poland. I want to buy several ones, also for my friends and avoid multiplied cost of shipment inside US.</p>
<p>GPS?  Any mention of GPS?</p>
<p>yes, there is GPS.</p>
<p>No microSD slot though</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; offline maps + tethering might make it usable in a car.</p>
<p>Gotta go looking for a car holder for it.</p>
<p>Last week everyone was tutting about Microsoft angering their OEM&#8217;s by entering the tablet space, and we don&#8217;t even know how much it will cost. Today Google unveils a tablet which is quite obviously subsidised and craps all over other Android tablets, but apparently this won&#8217;t anger OEM&#8217;s? Sounds inconsistent to me.</p>
<p>Thank you! I was waiting for someone else to say this.</p>
<p>Apparently this is being sold at cost. Basically, if you&#8217;re not Asus, stop building Android tablets, because there&#8217;s no point.</p>
<p>I had my finger on the pre-order button when I found it had GPS.  Then face-palmed when I found it had no removable storage.</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;m concerned, Android hardware had two, and only two, advantages over Apple&#8217;s offerings: removable batteries and removable storage.  Judging by Nexus history, Google seems bound and determined to make sure that there side of the fence is superior to Apple&#8217;s in exactly ZERO ways. &#8220;Holy shit, we have a feature that Apple doesn&#8217;t?! KILL IT WITH FIRE!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, Verge trolls, that&#8217;s hyperbole.  We all know that some android devices are superior in some ways to some iOS devices.  No, I&#8217;m not talking about the OS itself, just the hardware.  Yes, this CPU/GPU combo looks better than my iPad 3.  No, I will NOT call it &#8220;the New iPad.&#8221;   But dammit Google, you had ONE job (in my tech fantasy): to give me a proper mobile media tablet at a good price.  GPS was going to make it my new navigation device. And SD cards were going to, for the first time in more than a decade, allow me to carry my ENTIRE digital library with me, so that I can say, &#8220;Wait, I have that song!&#8221; instead of, &#8220;Wait, I have that on my&#8230; oh, no I don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;  It was going to let me use one device not only for hours of podcasts each day at work, but also the random movie from my already-transcoded DVD library.  I don&#8217;t care about service-side storage (no, I will not call it a Cloud).  I do not want to waste my bandwidth downloading my own content over and over &#8212; some people have data caps on their home service!  I definitely don&#8217;t want to waste my office&#8217;s bandwidth, for which I could be fired. The lack of a MicroSD slot has downgraded this from 2nd Coming to Pretty Nice.</p>
<p>usb otg cable? i know it&#8217;s not pretty but with that you can have unlimited storage!</p>
<p>It probably was just a cost saving option that they took in order to ensure they could offer the product at the $199 price point.  Hate to say it, but it seems to be the direction the future is taking us.  Swapping storage around physically is becoming a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Besides, isn&#8217;t Android all about choice?  This is an example of a choice where there is no SD slot.  There will probably be Droid tablets out there with SD slots, but you will probably pay more for them.</p>
<p>In for one! Hope it turns out not to be a dud!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m considering buying this just so I can have something Android, that is also decent.</p>
<p>I found it funny that they said they declared war on lag and then say it has a quad-core processor.  How about actually optimizing the software for the hardware&#8230; anyway, doesn&#8217;t look half bad.</p>
<p>Yep.<br />
I&#8217;ll get one.  It&#8217;s not a world shaking amazing product, but it&#8217;s a good neat little tablet that I can afford.<br />
When my next pay cheque comes in, I&#8217;ll put down the $299 (Australian price) for the 16 Gigger.</p>
<p>The flipside of this is that my old old, hated by the masses, Xperia X10 will be around for a while longer.</p>
<p>If Google is going against the Kindle Fire, it wins as a better device hands down.<br />
1280 &#215; 800 (215 ppi) vs. 1024 &#215; 600 (170 ppi)<br />
Quad core A9 vs. dual core A9<br />
1GB RAM vs. 512 MB RAM<br />
Front facing camera, microphone, bluetooth, NFC, 8/16GB storage<br />
Android 4.1 Jellybean vs. 2.3 Gingerbread with grey bookshelf skin.<br />
Play Store plus all amazon content except video vs. Amazon content<br />
9 vs. 7 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>Google may finally kick out all the fake Android tablets.</p>
<p>At £149 for the 8GB, they&#8217;ve suddenly got a fight with Amazon on more than one plain.</p>
<p>Its £40 more than the Kindle Touch in the UK, and you&#8217;d seriously have to consider why you wouldn&#8217;t throw an extra £40 at this device compared to an eInk Kindle. Yes, you have eInk vs LCD backlit to consider, but other than that the features this device has makes the Kindle Touch look incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>I think this is a nice tablet and all, but I really believe it will be difficult to compete in price with this:</p>

<p>Anyones thoughts?</p>
<p>For a start, there are 6.48 billion people who aren&#8217;t eligible for the offer.</p>
<p>Once again, toro gets shafted.</p>
<p>Because the GSM Galaxy Nexus is sold in dozens of countries world wide, compared to one for the (fake) CDMA Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Yeah I know. I&#8217;m just bitter about it all, obviously.</p>
<p>Hey, at least you don&#8217;t have the toroplus! That gets the shaft even more.</p>
<p>Team EOS nightlies + Imoseyon&#8217;s Lean Kernel = no shaft, just glorious stable Jessica Biel-like .putang</p>
<p>Please educate yourself, the Verizon Nexus is in AOSP, it is anything but fake.</p>
<p>Actually, the Nexus idea is ment to be no carrier branding etc.</p>
<p>Find me a CDMA Nexus that has no carrier branding, and I will withdraw my comment.</p>
<p>When the hell did anyone say that a Nexus was meant to have no branding? The idea was to make it as universal as possible, not avoid branding all together.</p>
<p>No carrier modifications.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t quite understand. The code for the Toro is contained in the AOSP. The radio binaries are also hosted there. Download the source from Android, compile it and flash your 100% carrier free ROM.</p>
<p>How does that not fulfill your &#8220;no carrier modifications&#8221; test?</p>
<p>Look at the back of the phone, there&#8217;s a clue.</p>
<p>Oh gotcha, didn&#8217;t realize you meant physically.</p>
<p>&#8230;although&#8230; if you&#8217;re using a Toro you <em>need</em> an extended battery (which requires a different battery door). No carrier branding on my Toro&#8230;</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t the G1 have a T-Mobile logo right on the front face?</p>
<p>I also ment as its locked, you can&#8217;t change its carrier.</p>
<p>Therefore thats a carrier restriction.</p>
<p>Completely valid.</p>
<p>I would argue the differences in bands which made the previous Nexii halfway compatible with GSM networks in the U.S. The only reason the GSM Galaxy Nexus can be used successfully on (all?) of them is because it&#8217;s pentaband, so it&#8217;s using a radio type that the rest of the world would probably laugh at for being unnecessary.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s essentially got a specialized radio, just like theToro, which allows it to work with Verizons network.</p>
<p>If that makes sense&#8230;</p>
<p>G1 is not a Nexus device but a Google Experience Device similar to the Motorola Xoom.</p>
<p>Your arbitrary lines in the sand are arbitrary, unfortunately for you reality doesn&#8217;t line up with your fiction. Not to mention that the &#8220;Nexus&#8221; brand is not static and has been, in the past year or so, changing. So again, you are wrong, please educate yourself.</p>
<p>Did I offend someone lol?</p>
<p>and the fact that it was dropped from AOSP for a while.</p>
<p>&#8220;The purpose of the Nexus phones is to offer a &#8220;pure Android&#8221; experience,<a href="#fn1">1</a> in which the phones come free of carrier or manufacturer modifications&quot;</p>
<p>it&#8217;s mostly because of the fact that it&#8217;s cdma not due to the popularity.  according to the guys that make cyanogen cdma is a &#8220;train wreck&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the truth, but to argue that the Verizon GNex is not a true Nexus device is ridiculous and shows a fundamental lack of knowledge. I am looking to possibly drop CDMA though really, when the switch is made to LTE it will be handled about the same.</p>
<p>No need for official CM support if you ask me (they are entitled to that &#8216;train wreck&#8217; opinion). There are plenty of other teams putting out stable as can be JB builds and incorporating features that kind of make CM10 feel dated or at least, behind the curve a bit.</p>
<p>CM puts out some amazing work, supporting a bevy of devices and their code set is utilized by many others..but just because CM doesn&#8217;t officially support a device, it&#8217;s not the end of the world. Plenty of really top notch teams out picking up the slack for toro and toroplus, allowing a CDMA owner to have the best from the CM world plus other amazing stuff in stable as a rock rls&#8217;s.</p>
<p>To everyone,. you&#8217;re really missing out if you&#8217;re on stock JB w/ a gnex&#8230; head on over to rootzwiki and/or XDA.</p>
<p>I own a GSM (on ST prepaid) and CDMA/Sprint GNEX btw&#8230; for dev purposes.</p>
<p>Agree completely, AOKP hit way before CM9, was more stable for a long time and still has a good amount more features than CM. Not trying to take anything away from CM, but on a Nexus device it&#8217;s pretty much just another ROM in a sea of decent roms. That being said, when I had my X2 I would have killed for some CM goodness.</p>
<p>At least for stability, CM has blown AOKP out of the water imo.  I used all the AOKP builds since day one until the RC came out for CM and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going back.</p>
<p>Totally agree.  Plus the official CM10 alpha for Toro is bug free as far as I&#8217;ve found and blows any &#8220;stable&#8221; CM9 out of the water.</p>
<p>This is useless, it&#8217;s ICS. Just get Jelly Belly on your VZW Nexus and you&#8217;ll be good to go.</p>
<p>What is the advantage of Cyanogenmod if you have a Galaxy Nexus and like the UI?<br />
I&#8217;m genuinely curious. Also are there any downsides?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there are any advantages to use this over stock. I mean this is a big downgrade from Jelly Bean if you install it surely?</p>
<p>Most of the advantages are around UI customization &#8211; things like the lockscreen and notification shade.</p>
<p>also &#8211; performance tweaks</p>
<p>Performance tweaks based on ICS, sure. But stock Jelly Bean will no doubt destroy any of those &#8220;enhancements&#8221;.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d have to be crazy to flash this over stock JB.</p>
<p>The downside is always the bugs <del>-  something not working like it should, reboots, etc. The PLUS about CM and other ROMS are their customization options -</del>  notification power widgets, removal of persistent Google Search widget on homepage, sound equalizer, and themes &#8212;  just to name a few. CM has the stock look also, and that&#8217;s been a major draw for many users, especially those coming from a skinned version of Android.</p>
<p>You can get notification power widgets and a custom launcher to get rid of the Google search widget without rooting or overwriting the OS.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t see the point if you have a Galaxy Nexus.<br />
Cyanogen mod is awesome if you want to get rid of a skin. His additions to stock ICS are not worth the hassle imho.<br />
Long ago, I experimented with custom roms on my nexus one&#8230; before going back to stock.<br />
Custom roms add a lot of possible tweaks that I absolutely don&#8217;t care about for 99% of them. So they just bloat the UI.</p>
<p>Um, not really. I am using a Galaxy Nexus, I flashed a custom ROM on day 2.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think its possible for me to stay stock. However, I am not a flash-addict, I do like sticking to one stable iteration for a month or 2 before flashing again though.</p>
<p>CM9/10 is good.  But I love AOKP because they add more options.  I like toggles on the notification tray, especially the Torch toggle.  NFC polling mode to screen off so I can use my NFC tags without the phone being unlocked.  Holding down the volume keys to skip tracks alone is worth flashing, although I wish it were included in cm10.  Customize the nav bar, so for instance you can hold down the back button to quit the current app.  Circle mod battery icon gives you the percentage.  Expandable volume panel, expanded options power screen, overclocking baked in</p>
<p>Same here. I was a flash-addict when I had my HTC HD2. Flashed ROMs pretty frequently on the HTC Sensation as well. Since getting my Galaxy Nexus, I&#8217;ve calmed down a lot and pretty much stick to the AOKP Milestone builds. Running an AOKP JB nightly right now since, well, I want Jelly Bean but probably going to stick to the Milestones once they start rolling out again.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine going back to stock now and losing all the features that AOKP includes in their ROMs.</p>
<p>I went from AOKP ICS to a stock Jelly Bean rom with no additions, and I did miss quite a few of the AOKP features, but honestly, I love the smoothness of Jelly Bean so much, it&#8217;s worth it, and at this point I&#8217;ve forgotten what the features I loved were anyway (though, no one should list them, because I&#8217;ll go back to missing them and I don&#8217;t want that haha).</p>
<p>Install CM10.  It&#8217; solid and you&#8217;ll get most of the features back +butter.</p>
<p>UI customization and performance enhancement.</p>
<p>More importantly, why not find out yourself by flashing?</p>
<p>I used to flash, haven&#8217;t done it since I got my Galaxy Nexus. I don&#8217;t see the need to. People shouldn&#8217;t flash for the sake of flashing&#8230;</p>
<p>People can do whatever they want with their phones. And btw do you know that the dev community contributes to AOSP so it&#8217;s actually quite useful what they are doing.</p>
<p>I heard one of the CM guys say that Google mostly ignores what others contribute&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>People can do whatever they want with their phones.</blockquote>
<p>I never said they couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote>And btw do you know that the dev community contributes to AOSP so it’s actually quite useful what they are doing.</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that they do, but what does that have to do with the average flasher who doesn&#8217;t contribute anything to AOSP.</p>
<p>I was just responding to this: <blockquote>More importantly, why not find out yourself by flashing?</blockquote></p>
<p>it doesn&#8217;t make sense to suggest flashing to someone who wants to know risks of flashing. At least try to answer his questions first (or point him/her to the right direction).</p>
<p>I can understand flashing if you want to get rid of a skin (that is why I used to flash).</p>
<p>That was my main reason for flashing my Incredible.  I flashed my GNEX at first because I wanted Jelly Bean and didn&#8217;t want to wait for Verizon to approve it.  I then flashed another ROM because I love having toggle widgets in my notification bar, as well as the ability to slide my finger across the top of my phone to increase/decrease screen brightness.   BTW, I&#8217;m running XenonHD</p>
<p>for me as someone who listens to 1+ hours of music on the go every day, CM9/10 has one feature i don&#8217;t want to miss: You can use the volume up/down buttons to get to the next/last track, without having to turn on the screen or anything else.</p>
<p>some headphones also allow you to do that without even touching your phone :-).</p>
<p>I have these bluetooth LG headphones that does this. It&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>If volume buttons have been assigned to switching tracks, how do you adjust the volume then (without turning on the screen)?</p>
<p>short presses &#8594; adjusting volumes<br />
long presses &#8594; next/previous song :)</p>
<p>easy, and works just fine</p>
<p>I think folks have listed the advantages pretty well. But I think more importantly, because of the ease of hacking the GNex, it gets the ROM first and acts as something of a base for the other devices. So IMO it&#8217;s less important in and of itself, except that it means other devices that need their %$^*# skins removed are closer. Or older devices that manufacturers dropped (currently running CM10 on my 2 year old Vibrant, for instance).</p>
<p>Used to also be a tweaked Gamma (less purple/yellow in screen) but this can also be achieved via alternate kernels AFAIK.</p>
<p>Jellybean also seems to have largely corrected most of those issues. Did for me!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve left the world of custom ROMs well behind, stock is good enough for me. If I want any tweaks or mods, there&#8217;s always a custom kernel.</p>
<p>Yep I only bothered with custom ROMs when I didn&#8217;t have a Nexus device.</p>
<p>New to custom roms, was totally blown away going from the buggy as $%^£ ICS rom on the Note to CM9.  Utterly transformed it, and made me realise I&#8217;ll only ever touch Nexus phones in the future.  I don&#8217;t mind messing with roms, but I&#8217;d rather not have to bother personally.</p>
<p>You know, there are a lot of people who say that their next phone will be a Nexus, me included.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m wondering what the impact will be once people who say the above are starting to roll off their 2 year contract.</p>
<p>if we are seeing 5 nexus devices by the end of this year. and they are just &#8220;normal&#8221; devices with nexus software on it it would be a huge impact. Just  imagine an HTC One ne<strong>X</strong>us</p>
<p>For me, I always flashed for the ability to get wireless tether and to dump skins such as motoblur.  With the FCC&#8217;s recent ruling, I think one of those justifications has gone away, which leaves the skin.  Certain CM9 is not going to cause me to get rid of my custom JB ROM.  This one just took a bit too long, and now IMO is obsolete.  That said, CM ROMs have always been very, very stable for me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad it&#8217;s not 4.1.1 based&#8230;</p>
<p>CM10 is, and there is a bunch of work going on for that.</p>
<p>ANd far less work will be required thatn going from CM7 to CM9 :)</p>
<p>so many CM9 ROMs have come out based on their nightlies, and this is only the FIRST stable release?  wow.  I guess the CM team are just perfectionists.</p>
<p>Do you remember a time when stable meant something? Pepperidge farm remembers.</p>
<p>I want that wallpaper</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>I just noticed that the picture for this post is very old. It has the old Google Voice icon</p>
<p>Oh, and old twitter, android market, and google talk too</p>
<p>It&#8217;s from the original Galaxy Nexus review, or maybe the Verizon one, but still.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird to think how old this phone is getting, considering how smooth it runs with Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>There is no reason to use this with jellybean out</p>
<p>CM9 for TouchPad, yay.</p>
<p>That would be nice.</p>
<p>It is nice&#8230; I run the CM9 Nightlies on my TP aka &#8216;Tenderloin&#8217;.  CM10 is in preview mode on it thanks to J Schullins, but has quite a way to go.</p>

<p>Smooth as can be and clean moboot to option back into WebOS for a better (more put together) Splashtop Remote experience.</p>
<p>Would MUCH rather use a Jelly Bean ROM than CyanogenMod 9. It&#8217;s gone downhill so much anyways, there used to be so much more customization.</p>
<p>Good to see that CyanogenMod team is still at it working  hard bringing quality stable ROMS,  but the Nexus is the first Android phone that I have not even bothered to root or try different ROMS because I am very happy with the stock OS and after the jelly bean update the phone is fantastic,  I just wish CyanogenMod would give the CDMA Nexus users some love because I fee like the GSM NEXUS owners are pretty happy</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me the NAME od that WEATHER WIDGET?? Please!!</p>
<p>Looks like Beautiful Widgets with a skin to me.  Don&#8217;t feel like looking to see if I can find which skin exactly, but there are a lot to choose from and should be easy to find.</p>
<p>And, if you feel like it, it&#8217;s pretty easy to make your own skins&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running 4.1 on my Toro since it was leaked out during Google I/O but I might give CM 10 a try once it comes out.</p>
<p>Shame, so much effort lost. Can&#8217;t see many people getting this because of Jelly Bean. I know I will just be waiting for 10. Is there anyone who will be getting this?</p>
<p>Just in time for 4.2 to come out!</p>
<p>Android sure has got this stuff figured out!</p>
<p>yeah, 2 major updates per year versus 1 for the other &#8220;leading&#8221; platforms</p>
<p>Did the SGIII come with 2.3? <br />
I thought it came with 4.0, making this 1 major update per year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Android, you can have as many software updates as you want, as long as you&#8217;re willing to buy a new phone for each one!</p>
<p>Or you work in IT and know what you&#8217;re doing with your phone. To each their own. I don&#8217;t understand the need to bash one or the other.</p>
<p>If you like technology, which I&#8217;m assuming you do since you&#8217;re here, then you&#8217;ll understand the benefit to using and understanding all major systems.</p>
<p>It came with ics fool</p>
<p>It came with ics</p>
<p>Hahahaha. Two major updates per year&#8230;for a few hundred thousand Android users willing to buy a new phone for each one!</p>
<p>Meanwhile there are already over 100 million people using iOS 6.</p>
<p>Again: Android sure has this stuff figured out!  NOT.</p>
<p>Those of us that care, own Nexus devices.</p>
<p>If updates were an owners primary concern, everyone would own one.</p>
<p>Like my friend who bought the Galaxy Nexus day 1, and then had to buy ANOTHER one on ANOTHER carrier in order to get Jelly Bean?</p>
<p>Yeah, Nexus shmexus. Owning a Nexus is like owning insurance. <strong>Maybe</strong> It&#8217;ll help you get the latest OS, but it&#8217;s far from a guarantee!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all iPhone&#8217;s get the latest software day 1, every time. How is it that Apple is the only company to have this figured out?  Pathetic!</p>
<p>Re your friend, I&#8217;m guessing the V-word is involved somehow? ;)</p>
<p>Yup. Funny how Verizon iPhones still get their new OS updates the same day as everyone else, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a Verizon problem. It&#8217;s an Android problem.</p>
<p>Well the UK versions have 4.1, so clearly it&#8217;s not Android.</p>
<p>With iOS, I think it&#8217;s because Apple are able to throw their weight around more than other manufacturers (mess with our OS and we&#8217;ll stop supplying you with our insanely popular phone). The power balance is tilted the other way with Android, so manufacturers need to start becoming more assertive about this.</p>
<p>Right now, 4.1.2 is rolling out to any Galaxy Nexus in the world, except for the Verizon and the Sprint ones. Yea, it surely isn&#8217;t their fault. <em>facepalm</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned:<br />
GSM Nexus One (ordered from the U.S) &#8211; got all updates as long as it was supported.<br />
GSM Nexus S &#8211; got all updates and is still being supported. 4.1.2 recently dropped.<br />
<strong>still own</strong><br />
GSM Galaxy Nexus &#8211; Not long ago got updated to 4.1.2,<br />
Nexus 7 &#8211; Same as above.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t vouch for the state of CDMA networks in the U.S (we&#8217;re GSM only here in the UK) but I can vouch for the regular updates to the Nexus devices I&#8217;ve owned in the UK.</p>
<p>Real shit luck to your &#8220;friend&#8221; either way.</p>
<p>Software updates shouldn&#8217;t come down to &#8216;luck&#8217; nor should you have to be so choosy about which phone to buy just in order to have a shot at being eligable for it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s bullshit, and the more you act like it&#8217;s not, the more you&#8217;re missing the point.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m a tech savvy consumer who will put my money where I know I&#8217;m well supported.</p>
<p>An example: I bought a Motorola Xoom Wifi here in the UK, under the premise it would be treated the same way as the Wifi model was in the US. No indications on the launch would have lead me to believe otherwise.</p>
<p>After <strong>not</strong> recieving updates like the US model was (even though they were hardware identical) I eventually unlocked the bootloader and flashed to the US based firmware to receive updates like I expected.</p>
<p>Was I happier at that point &#8211; yes. Will I ever buy a Motorola deivce again thanks to the way &#8220;non-US&#8221; based Xoom&#8217;s were shafted with update delay after update delay? Fuck no.</p>
<p>If people really do worry about the update situation they are well within their rights (and ability) to vote with their wallets. I know I always will.</p>
<p>Motorola seem to seriously treat GSM devices as second citizens, its quite disgusting since most other manufacturer do the opposite.</p>
<p>On top of that, they lock some of the bootloaders too (although you <strong>can</strong> unlock now).</p>
<p>I remember seeing the Droid and thinking I&#8217;d like the GSM equivalent, the Milestone. Locked bootloader? GTFO Moto.</p>
<p>Motorola aren&#8217;t the only one. Samsung still haven&#8217;t released the Tab 8.9 ICS update to the UK, despite releasing it in the US.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve released ICS for the 7.0 and 10.1 here, which makes even less sense!</p>
<p><strong>SNIFF</strong> <strong>SNIFF</strong> &#8230; I smell Troll</p>
<p>So it means the UK Galaxy Nexus is updated by Google. Or you&#8217;ve flashed it so Google can recognize it as a US GNex.</p>
<p>If you brought it unlocked its Google, subsidised varies. You can move it onto the Google update path though.</p>
<p>I got mine unlocked, but it&#8217;s updated by Samsung. (It&#8217;s a &#8220;yakjuvs&#8221; build)</p>
<p>you should get out of the US if you dont like it.</p>
<p>You can only buy one Galaxy Nexus at the Google Play Store.  Shipped directly from Google itself.  It gets updates as they&#8217;re released.</p>
<p>And if your friend had read the news before even considering buying the Verizon model, he/she would have known it wasn&#8217;t going to be pretty.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about the OS ecosystem. In one hand you have the iOS which is a closed ecosystem where Apple just makes the new version and rolls it out on to the carriers and since there is so many customers on iPhone they would release it as quickly as they can.</p>
<p>On the other we have Android which is a open ecosystem so when a new  version rolls out manufactures have to work on the new version and add in their stuff (like Touchwiz etc&#8230;) Then the manufactures send it to the carriers and since there might not be so many people using that exact phone in their system they might not send it out to customers.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t blame Android for that, its how the ecosystem works. If you want it even quicker root your phone and custom ROM it.</p>
<p>Like the Verizon Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>Wait&#8230;</p>
<p>Troll much? It seems that this place has become asshat central since Engadget moved over to livefyre.</p>
<p>haha, what?</p>
<p>No, there&#8217;s 100 million people using different fragmented versions of iOS 6. Nice try though!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SGS 3 is a very popular android phone thanks to apple&#8217;s lawsuit, so this is a good thing to see this update.</p>
<p>Who cares about Apple, this about Android.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that Froyo is still a better os than iOS 6.</p>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Are you lost?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s funny, with apple you can, sorta, update, but many would rather not. E.g. I do not want to lose my YouTube app on my ipad .</p>
<p>Android is owned by Google and Google makes the Galaxy Nexus so yeah.</p>
<p>Google makes it?  Really?  Pretty sure it&#8217;s the SAMSUNG Galaxy Nexus there bud!</p>
<p>And even that phone doesn&#8217;t get software updates immediately unless you buy it carrier unlocked straight from Google, which maybe like 10,000 people on the planet actually do.  Most of the (pathetic) 500,000 Galaxy Nexus units sold have been on Verizon, which didn&#8217;t release 4.1 for months.</p>
<p>Android is winning ya&#8217;ll</p>
<p>Thank you for ignoring the rest of the world. /s</p>
<p>you do realise there is a world outside of team america dont you?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not real, though.</p>
<p>You seem rather pathetically angry about this.  Oh wait, you&#8217;re just trolling.</p>
<p>Samsung makes the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>I thought 4.2 rumor was debunked completely&#8230; might not come until next year sometime, maybe Google IO</p>
<p>Key Lime Pie is rumoured for next year. 4.2 will probably roll out with the new Nexus device(s).</p>
<p>youre talking bull, 4.2 ain&#8217;t out for a good while. i have that on extremely good authority.</p>
<p>what you are saying is:</p>
<p>i like the apple update system more, so that every device that gets updated to the latest version of the OS will miss out on the best feature of the new OS to have a reason for people to still buy the latest.</p>
<p>in Android terms this would mean, Jelly Bean is rolled out to every handset, but this particular android version does lack Project Butter, so that the Galaxy Nexus is still the best in terms of OS features.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s shortsighted to claim that Apple always updates it&#8217;s old phones with the latest OS, while this is not true. They update the phones with software they call like the latest OS, but which lacks features of the latest phone just for the sake of making the latest handset look more attractive to a potential buyer.</p>
<p>samsung updated it&#8217;s original galaxy s with a feature pack instead of the real ICS, which is probably what you could compare the most with what apple is doing and still samsung got flack for it, because they called it &#8220;feature pack&#8221; and not &#8220;ICS update&#8221;. perhaps it&#8217;s just that android users in general are more tech savyy and would find out that they only have a feature pack and not the full ICS, instead of iPhone users blindly swallowing getting &#8220;iOS 5&#8221; without Siri and stuff like that.</p>
<p>well done Apple&#8230; keeping their customers on the blind side and feeding them imaginary stuff</p>
<p>US carriers take note. THIS IS HOW IT&#8217;S DONE</p>
<p>By delaying all the UK updates until all carriers are ready?</p>
<p>By not artificially delaying updates just to put in bloatware and make people wait just for the heck of it.</p>
<p>If only there was an Android phone that got faster updates despite what carrier it was on????</p>
<p>Oh what I wonderful world it would be.</p>
<p>Funny, US carriers all allowed all iPhones to update to iOS 6 on day 1.  Maybe GOOGLE should take note and stop screwing over their customers with their shitty ecosystem.</p>
<p>But Google doesn&#8217;t update the phones, the OEMs.  Unless it&#8217;s a Nexus.</p>
<p>Except the Verizon Nexus.</p>
<p>And most non-US Galaxy Nexii (elsewhere, they&#8217;re updated by Samsung).</p>
<p>No, <strong>APPLE</strong> updates all the iOS devices. They basically told all the carriers that if they want to carry their device(s), they can&#8217;t interfere with the software. No Bloatware, no restrictions, no delayed updates.</p>
<p>honestly, the OEM&#8217;s just need to take this kind of information public. HTC could come out say that they wanted to bring us a truly fantastic phone, but carrier X wanted it loaded with bloatware and they wanted us to put logos everywhere, and we said no.</p>
<p>get the consumers angrier at their carriers.</p>
<p>And they would never sell another phone on that carrier. No, its on you as a consumer to buy an unlocked phone and even change the carrier if your current one does not have what you want.</p>
<p>Get an iPhone, jerkoff.  Oh, you already have one?  Why the fuck do you care?</p>
<p>UK operators don&#8217;t add any bloat and have standardized handsets, and they test updates very quickly.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re out of your mind if you think that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Vodafone, which is who I&#8217;m on, add their own music service, their own app recommendation service as well as a curated app store, an update app to specifically update their own added apps and their &#8220;My Vodafone&#8221; app, which is the only one you can actually uninstall yet is the only one that&#8217;s actually marginally useful.</p>
<p>All the rest I had to use the &#8220;Disable&#8221; feature of ICS to get rid of.</p>
<p>Okay, changed to &#8220;much bloat&#8221;. But compared to America its still nothing.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re confusing the unlocked phones that are prevalent in the UK with the carrier controlled phones that are also prevalent in the UK.  But at least they have more choices than the US.</p>
<p>No, this is not how it;s done.</p>
<p>How it&#8217;s done should be Google actually talking to the carriers before release so they can release the update within the month.</p>
<p>3 months is better than the US but still slow.</p>
<p>Updates in the UK have fairly little todo with the operators. Samsung make the update for the region, then just ask the operator for the nod, and they start shipping it to unlocked devices as well.</p>
<p>Our market is completely different to the US. We have a decent regulator.</p>
<p>Whilst the push from manufacturers should work like that in theory, it is not true of all operators.  Each have to make minor adjustments to the file image  (even if only to get their logo popping up when you turn the device on).</p>
<p>For OTA to locked handsets, it seems to be the responsibility of the operator to deploy the update who can choose when they want to do so.</p>
<p>But completely agree,  we do have a really good regulator.</p>
<p>I remember for the HTC One X the operator OTAs were downloaded from HTC too. So maybe Three etc give the files to HTC and HTC do the changes. Not quite sure how it works.</p>
<p>Google gives the code to Samsung, they add their stuff for each device, they hand that off to operators who add their stuff and make &#8220;tweaks&#8221; for their specific network and then hand it all back to Samsung to push out. Not sure if that happens with HTC but I assume the same.</p>
<p>ROFLMFAO</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how carrier customization should be an excuse.  If Microsoft can design a platform to run on tens of thousands of device types, Google should be able to do the same.  Android needs a standard driver model.</p>
<p>But it is an excuse, even on Windows Phone&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.winrumors.com/microsoft-confirms-some-carriers-are-blocking-windows-phone-7-update/" target="_blank">http://www.winrumors.com/microsoft-confirms-some-carriers-are-blocking-windows-phone-7-update/</a></p>
<p>Very true, but it runs on Linux and they refuse to provide a stable driver abi because they believe it would only benefit closed source drivers. I don&#8217;t really agree with that &#8211; it would also benefit third party open source drivers, but I guess they just think it is too much effort or something.</p>
<p>Looking forward to getting this update. On T-Mobile tho so might have to wait a couple more weeks.</p>
<p>T-Mobile will probably have it in a week.</p>
<p>I really hope you are that lucky. I have a HOX on T-mobile and we only got the 4.0.4 update less than 2 weeks ago. Mayble they&#8217;ll be quicker for the S III.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s truly sad is Motorola releasing 2 Droid RAZR&#8217;s yesterday and not one comes with 4.1 preloaded yet they are part of Google!</p>
<p>Firstly, they&#8217;re not stock. They&#8217;re closer to stock than Sense/Touchwiz, but still need work.</p>
<p>Secondly, the developers can&#8217;t keep aiming for a moving target &#8211; they need to pick an Android version suitable (4.0 might have been more stable/suitable than 4.1 at the time) and run with it.</p>
<p>Verge please review this update! Battery life? Smoothness? Different features?</p>
<p>Oh look, fanboys have managed to turn simple news of an update into a flame war. Will wonders never cease?</p>
<p>Interested to see what Samsung do with S-Voice now that Google Now has arrived.</p>
<p>And how do you activate Google Now on devices with a physical home button?</p>
<p>Hold down the home/physical key.</p>
<p>I thought that did recent apps?  where will recent apps be now?</p>
<p>Samsung added a shortcut to Google Now when you bring up the recent apps. It&#8217;s located at the bottom, along with two other shortcuts that I can&#8217;t think of.</p>
<p>Just go look at a Galaxy Note II or GSIII Jelly Bean video on youtube and you&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Thanks, I will.</p>
<p>oi! CARRIERS are rolling this out and i still don&#8217;t have it on my international version? What the hell, y0</p>
<p>Who cares. Been sporting 4.1.2 on my GNex for a while. Besides, this news is okay compared to US carriers, like a big one that just released 4.0 to one of their phones.</p>
<p>samsucks they update all the CARRIER /locked galaxy s3  and keep the people who has unlocked non-branded galaxy s3 waiting</p>
<p>i just updateed to DLID, and today it DLIJ comes out &lt;.&lt;</p>
<p>I love the fact that this is rolling out from carriers and yet the unbranded phones are still waiting and wondering.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had Jelly Bean (4.1.2) on my Verizon GS3 for months. What are you all waiting for? The carriers? I stopped waiting for them a long time ago. If you want it done right, do it yourself.</p>
<p>4.1.2 is a week old.  You mean 4.1.1?</p>
<p>doubt it.</p>
<p>cm is already pushing 4.1.2 nightlies.</p>
<p>&#8220;months&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes I meant 4.1.1 for months. Sorry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ridiculous how the unbranded versions haven&#8217;t got the update yet. I switched from ios and deliberately bought the international version so I get the update quicker as it doesn&#8217;t go through carrier. Pathetic.</p>
<p>I also bought mine from carphonewarehouse on o2 as I assumed that I would get it first with no hassles how wrong was I? Oh well looks like I&#8217;m finally going to have to do what I did with my desire and go with Cyanogen.</p>
<p>And over here in Canada&#8230;..</p>
<p>Hmm. How about O2 customers in ROI that have an SII &#8211; any plans known?</p>
<p>Glad this didn&#8217;t take 6 months.</p>
<p>International versions ususally don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s the US carriers that will probably dealy this for Sprint/VZW/AT&amp;T/T-Mob for a few months yet. Fortunately, all the hardware is basically the same, so there shouldn&#8217;t be too much of an issue, but I don&#8217;t see this dropping for any US carriers anytime soon, especially Sprint/VZW as they&#8217;re CDMA.</p>
<blockquote>Fortunately, all the hardware is basically the same</blockquote>
<p>Yes except for the different processor, ram, radio, gpu&#8217;s etc.</p>
<p>Yep basically the same</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about the U.S variants in which he&#8217;s actually right. As soon as a U.S version leaks out, it&#8217;ll most likely be smooth sailing for the dev community to get JB on their S3s.</p>
<p>I thought he was referring to the differences between the variants and the main model.</p>
<p>Sorry, what I meant was you don&#8217;t have some versions with a slide-out keyboard, like some previous Galaxy variants that were completely left out in the cold when it came to updates.</p>
<p>All they share in common is the case and touchwiz lol.</p>
<p>Actually, the US variants all use the Snapdragon S4 CPU and the Adreno 220 GPU, and all have 2GB RAM. The only difference is the propriety radio drivers so 99% of the update will be the same for most US variants.</p>
<p>Nooo, I was referring to the differences between the main model and the variants.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be to surprised if the US versions get updated quickly. Apple has a lawsuit against the SIII and Nexus over the unified search maybe Jelly Bean is Samsung&#8217;s way out the Nexus is already get updates that remove the unified search. Maybe Samsung has decided to try and avoid these lawsuits all together. Apple cant sue them for unified search if Samsung removes it.</p>
<p>Second sentence made no sense.</p>
<p>Ya i realized that i was on the mobile app. What i was trying to say that Samsung might push this update faster due to the Unified search lawsuit with Apple, the Galaxy Nexus is already showing up with an update that removes the unified search.</p>
<p>I knew this would take only 2 months for the flagships, just like it did for Gingerbread, because JB is a lot more like Gingerbread as an update than it is like ICS. ICS was a major upgrade code base wise. It&#8217;s why it&#8217;s taken this long for the ROM community to port to devices, too, and why it took 6 months for companies to do it. At least ICS still came to quite a few phones&#8230;unlike WP8.</p>
<p>The palm swipe for screen shots isn&#8217;t new. I&#8217;m able to do that now on 4.0.4 with my S3. I always thought that was the only way to take screenshots.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I thought too&#8230; not a new feature.</p>
<p>It was introduced in the original Galaxy Note afaik.</p>
<p>Thankfully it&#8217;s not as that seems to be pretty darn picky. Hitting the home and power button and the same time (and holding them for a second) will take a screenshot as well.</p>
<p>It is a pretty bad gesture, I have to say. Because it recognizes my palm as a finger and thus scrolls around in the text I want to take a screenshot of all the time.</p>
<p>Verizon LTE, 4.0.4 Gnex. /endrant</p>
<p>Knowing Verizon it will probably be mid october when they finally push out Jellybean for the Nexus.</p>
<p>Sadsies&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;ve been gone too long from the Rooting game.</p>
<p>Time to go back. Wonder what&#8217;s good for LTE Gnex. I really don&#8217;t care for tweaking things myself, not anymore, I just want a stable and up to date Pure Google Experience.</p>
<p>I rooted last week and flashed <a href="http://www.peteralfonso.com/2012/07/bugless-beast-41x-jelly-bean.html" target="new">Bugless Beast</a> on my Verizon Gnexus.  It&#8217;s identical to stock Jelly Bean on a GSM Galaxy Nexus, no tweaks just pure 4.1.  You even get native tethering and wallet support.  If you&#8217;re planning on rooting and want a stock experience, I&#8217;d recommend it.</p>
<p>Cool! I&#8217;ll give that one a shot. Guess I got my lunch plans for tomorrow haha.</p>
<p>The Nexus S 4G is a joke if this is true</p>
<p>Blame CDMA carriers.</p>
<p>I want to leave Verizon so bad but i cant because of LTE.</p>
<p>Question is, will they skin all the Jellybean out of Jellybean like they skinned all the ICS out of ICS.</p>
<p>For the most part, yes.  But there isn&#8217;t really anything different, UI wise, vs ICS.  The advanced notifications are there as is the Butter.</p>
<p>Google now too.</p>
<p>True, but Google Now is basically just the Google Search App.</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t got 4.1 jelly bean on my Galaxy Nexus yet on Verizon even though updates should&#8217;ve came mid-July</p>
<blockquote>even though updates should’ve came mid-July</blockquote>
<p>Nope. The GNex CDMA isn&#8217;t on the same update path. It&#8217;s frustrating, but it&#8217;s a &#8220;nexus&#8221; in name only.</p>
<p>i predicted this a few months ago, that the more updates to the OS become a factor for choosing devices OEMs will start to pay more attention to it.</p>
<p>As an owner of an HTC One device (read: awful support and slow updates), I know for sure that my next Android phone is going to be a Samsung. A JB version already? This is ridiculously quick!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fast indeed..but please get your history facts straight.. HTC was the first to get ics and gb..</p>
<p>I am sorry.. I am not talking about the past. I am talking about the present. I said I am an owner of an HTC One device (One S).. We still don&#8217;t have ICS 4.0.4 yet or plans for the near future. If we get JB before Q4, I&#8217;d be surprised.</p>
<p>hope it works better than the ISC update for the sprint galaxy s2 &#8230; the update made the GPS problem worse &#8230; if you turn on GPS you have about a 20% chance you can turn it off.</p>
<p>Sprint sucks balls.where the f@#&amp;k is my jb update for my Gnexus</p>
<p>Basically just a rip off of iOS.  They have to get it out before they get shut down.  Instead of rushing fast to get their ripped off OS out the door they could have used that energy to innovate.</p>
<p>If iOS was like that, I&#8217;d have an iPhone, not a Galaxy S III.</p>
<p>But it isn&#8217;t. So I haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>#trollingthetrolls</p>
<p>While Touchwiz didn&#8217;t directly copy the iPhone, it is hard to deny the similarities between the Touchwiz Camera app and the iOS one. <br />
<img src="http://new.tinygrab.com/dead35fa155836ee3bf28c3104beadbbb9dbdc55c4.png" /></p>
<p>Compare that to the stock ICS/JB camera which has its own unique look.</p>
<p>Its funny because its true!</p>
<p>This has to be among the most useless possible news. Is there anybody who reads tech-oriented sites who hasn&#8217;t rooted their phone? Spend a few minutes on XDA and run the latest version and forget what the carriers want you to run.</p>
<p>If the VZW Galaxy S III gets this update before the VZW Nexus&#8230;. I may hurt myself.</p>
<p>I wonder when Samsung will update the non-yakju Galaxy Nexuses. At this point I think Google should just take those devices out of Samsung&#8217;s hands and update them themselves.</p>
<p>Been running cm10 on my tmo gs3. It flies, and is almost totally bug free.  Cyanogen himself maintains it, and it shows.</p>
<p>If this gets updated before my Vzn Gnex I will be livid. There really isn&#8217;t that much of a difference between the international and US versions.</p>
<blockquote> There really isn’t that much of a difference between the international and US versions.</blockquote>
<p>The major difference is that The GSM one gets updates straight from Google, where as the CDMA one gets it from your network.</p>
<p>Not entirely true, sadly. A lot of the Nexuses sold in Europe are yakjuxw. Mine was until I reflashed it.</p>
<p>(After all the fuss on here about just buying a Nexus to get the latest software, I was pretty shocked to discover that dirty little secret. The yakjuxw builds get updates from Samsung, not Google, and are currently stuck on 4.0.4. )</p>
<p>For the international version only.</p>
<p>Which is the major version which has probably sold more then all others.</p>
<p>Yeah for the international version</p>
<p>Good to see that Google Now hasn&#8217;t been stripped. I haven&#8217;t had that experience using S-Voice, but I can&#8217;t imagine it is better than Now in any way.</p>
