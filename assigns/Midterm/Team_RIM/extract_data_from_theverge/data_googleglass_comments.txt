<p>new <span class="caps">DEAL</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> IT! gif <span class="caps">NOW</span>!!! also, this is awesome!</p>
<p>I knew it! Thought of this when u mentioned it during the Vergecast.</p>
<p>Wow this is amazing.. amazing, amazing, amazing, article</p>
<p>Unbelievably polished and professional. This site keeps raising my definition of excellent reporting. There&rsquo;s not a single other outfit that&rsquo;s putting out content that even resembles stuff like this.</p>

<p>google glass is overrated by the android fans just because its made by google. Fact: google glass is not amazing, it just shows a clock, the weather, and lets you take pics. That is the extent of its features, and theres nothing good about it. Its a gigantic gimick and anyone saying its innovative wouldnt be saying that if it wasnt made by google.</p>
<p>I bet you&rsquo;re fun at parties.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s kind of right though.  Maybe in 5 years&rsquo; time when there&rsquo;s a convergence of tech and perfect UI (I don&rsquo;t think the voice approach is very elegant) it can be one of those things you can&rsquo;t live without, but in its current form, it doesn&rsquo;t seem very useful.</p>
<p>Seems useful to me, like when the wife is talking to me n my heads buried in my phone I get no end of grief, now I can be like yeah, uhuh, yep, really?  <em>-Are you listening to me?</em> &hellip;&hellip;..What?!! I&rsquo;m lookin right at you aren&rsquo;t I!</p>
<p>Well, look how far Android has come in such a short time.  Presumably they could release this version this year, and just 1 year later have a version that can project anywhere in your field of vision. (imagine things like the camera noticing bar codes, and telling you &lsquo;Hey, this is on sale and $50 cheaper at <span class="caps">XXXX</span> store nearby&rsquo;, or even telling you perhaps &lsquo;90% of people who buy the thing you&rsquo;re looking at rate it as bad&rsquo;).  Right now it might be pictures/video/google search/navigation, but we have no idea what improvements might happen between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p>Plus, the actual hardware is merely a display and touch interface on the side.  If they open it up to 3rd party apps being able to display things on it imagine where that could go.</p>
<p>Great idea. That would be a great reason to purchase..</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just mad &lsquo;cause he&rsquo;s in the &ldquo;innovators&rdquo; camp&hellip; which really hasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;innovated&rdquo; since, oh&hellip; about 2007.</p>
<p>Time will tell but it seems like basic social updates, third-party integration (think RunKeeper) and AR will all be part of the package. Also, who cares who&rsquo;s making it? It&rsquo;s been established it will also work with iOS devices. Google might be first but they won&rsquo;t be the last. Wearable computing is going to have as much of impact as smartphones have had. And even if it is a &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo;, it&rsquo;ll be an improvement on Bluetooth earpieces.</p>
<p>Look at the impact smartphones and tablets have had on gaming with the Wii U, Xbox Smartglass, and Vita Crossplay&hellip; they can suck it.  Make Glass talk to my PS4 and give me a <span class="caps">HUD</span> that I can manipulate with the Kinect-like sensor by moving things with my hands in the space in front of me.  Sounds pretty damn immersive.</p>
<p>Yes! It would be awesome if suddenly the game&rsquo;s <span class="caps">HUD</span> is next to your vision. It&rsquo;s a much better gaming experience and I&rsquo;m not even /s. This can be great for gaming.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking Sony, a company that is known to only do proprietary hardware, to allow third party hardware. Yeah, no.</p>
<p>The chance of coming up with their own version of this in the future, when the technology is worth integrating into a system is something I could see. If there is one thing Sony won&rsquo;t do, other than allow third party hardware onto their systems, it is throw things against the wall to see what sticks.</p>
<p>Sony doesnt interface with third party mobile devices?</p>
<p>Oh hey, someone is wrong.</p>
<p>I only see trouble with this device as people use it to check each other&rsquo;s power levels and as they find that someone&rsquo;s power levels is over 9000 they&rsquo;ll rage into accidentally breaking such a fine piece of technology.</p>
<p>You mean, Key Lime Pie will have an integrated Dragon Radar holo app?</p>
<p>Now that meteor in Russia couldn&rsquo;t have come in a better time.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re awesome</p>
<p>It will also cause you to have a really ridiculous widows peak and hair that stands four feet high. Also, lots of yelling incoherently.</p>
<p>Siri is a gigantic gimmick, criticizing something that&rsquo;s still under heavy development and not even commercially available then call it overrated (by whom really? I haven&rsquo;t seen a &ldquo;overrated&rdquo; review yet) is just plain stupid.</p>
<p>I agree that this is a work in progress, but I do not agree that Siri is a gigantic gimmick. Have you ever really used Siri. I use it daily and it really is amazing. Siri may not be as fast as Google Now/Voice for internet searches, but when used for stuff like reminders, texting, calling people, looking up stuff on the internet, mapping&hellip;.well, it is very useful.  And Siri does reminders, calling people, text and emails 1000% better than Google Now does them. Yes, I do know because I also have a Nexus 4 that I have been trying out.</p>
<p>To be driving down the road, not have to remove my eyes even for a second and have my phone text someone, read my text, email someone or place a call is extremely convenient. So before you smear Apple because you are in love with Google think about it. Dont speak out of turn or say something you have to support to back it up. Dont listen to the masses. Dont let other tell you what to think. Think for yourself.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say that one is better than the other because I have limited experience with Google now and next to no experience with Siri. However, all of the things you mentioned, while driving, are things that you have been able to do even before google now (google voice action commands with android 2.2 I believe but I could be wrong and it might have been earlier) and I agree that being able to do these things is great.</p>
<p>Can it. For starters had that deal gone down with Verizon and Siri landed as an Verizon/<span class="caps">DROID</span> exclusive. Just about every current Siri fan would have been calling it a gimmick. And you know what&hellip; it IS a gimmick. It&rsquo;s not like this hadn&rsquo;t been around before. The app was bought by Apple and there were Android apps doing the same thing like Speaktoit. No one thought much of this idea until Apple blessed it and all the fans started raving about it. Mind you much of this functionality was already baked into Android. About the only thing you didn&rsquo;t have was calendar control. The reminders, messaging etc. were already there and a bit more flexible on Android as you can specify they app you want to use for some things.</p>
<p>And Siri really shouldn&rsquo;t be mentioned in the same paragraph as Google Now. Its a totally different beast. Where Siri is advanced voice commands Now is about doing things for you without you having to ask. Its about knowing where you are, what you&rsquo;re doing or about to do and what you normally do to have the information you&rsquo;ll most likely need in place. Siri is good at understanding your requests worded in various ways but its not really intelligent when compared to Now.</p>
<p>You do know that Siri was not a finished product and was a completely different beast before Apple purchased it, right? I&rsquo;ve used Android and there so called voice actions since the Nexus One and have owned every Nexus device besides the Nexus 10. Yes, Google Now does a lot of great things, but it is no where as polished as Siri is. Being a fan of Android and iOS I can say that as I&rsquo;ve actually used both for more than just a couple minutes. You can&rsquo;t call one a gimmick without calling the other a gimmick as yes they are different things, but they do a lot of the same things. Google Now is great for Google searches, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it great at predicting about what your going to do. Yes, it knows the traffic to a place I commonly visit, but in the same regard it is mixing up my favorite restaurant with my job and so forth. I get a lot more junk in Google Now than I ever get worthwhile material and I think if you really thought about it you would feel the same. Beyond the release of Jelly Bean and when the new features slowly trickle out I often forget it is even there and don&rsquo;t use it often at all (mostly because of all the junk that I mentioned above as it is more a hassle then anything and Im constantly swiping junk away. For example, I like to check sports scores very often and I have teams that I really don&rsquo;t care about, but I want to know the score they are currently playing. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I always want to catch every game they play especially in seasons that are extremely long like basketball and baseball.)</p>
<p>I find it funny how people that talk about Siri and immediately there are a bunch of comments praising Google Now for its speed or functionality and how they feel it trumps Siri. Yes, they both are great, but I have yet to meet someone that really uses it often. Siri on the other hand is very functional. Yes, it has it&rsquo;s problems and is far from perfect, but if you have ever had a person in your phone book that uses a different spelling (My wife&rsquo;s name is Krystle) good luck getting Google Now to find it. I honestly had to change her name to my wife to get it to work whereas, Siri will remember if you say call my wife and it asks only once who that is. This works for everything. It is hands down better at the basics like sending a quick text or email whereas Google Now is more often then not some comical rendition of what it thinks I said. It is no way great or praiseworthy like you are trying to make it out to be. In time I think it will, but so will Siri. Siri is honestly something I use daily when I am driving and is integrated with the headphones that come with the phone. I had a hard time finding a pair that worked with my Galaxy Nexus or Nexus 7 and all the errors I mentioned above where maginified when I finally did.</p>
<p>On the last thought do you really think for a second the product that Verizon would have released would have been anywhere near what Apple did? There is no way in God&rsquo;s green earth that it would be. Then it would be a gimmick. To sum up the difference between Siri and Google Now is the same difference I see in all iOS vs Android. Apple has a product that is useful and very polished whereas Google has a product that is on its way, but not quite there. Do I wish some of the features of Google Now was in Siri? Of course I do, but I would rather have the polish of doing the common things like voice recognition that make everything better than having it work with some third party apps (does Google Now even do this? I know you can launch an app, but you can do the same on Siri), or get some things fed to you that you might need later, but I really just want what I ask for not to have to constantly dig through worthless content to get to one or two worthwhile cards.</p>
<p>Siri is however only one facet of the iPhone. The <span class="caps">WHOLE</span> of Glasses seems to be a gimmick at the moment. This may change in the future, but at the moment it&rsquo;s rather less functional and usefull than the Mk1 iPhone.</p>
<p>I kinda just have to say &ldquo;<span class="caps">STFU</span>&rdquo; when people say Siri is a &ldquo;gimmick.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;ve forgotten what the word &lsquo;gimmick&rsquo; means when you sloppily throw the word around.</p>
<p>Siri isn&rsquo;t a gimmick when I use it several times a day to set reminders, reply to texts, set destinations for the <span class="caps">GPS</span> and more.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re really saying is that you don&rsquo;t like something if Apple does it. Totally valid if that&rsquo;s where you want to be. But you&rsquo;re not offering up anything that can disprove that I find Siri helpful &ndash; and you&rsquo;re being just as dismissive as they guy you claim is being &ldquo;plain stupid&rdquo; for the exact criticism.</p>
<p>video? navigation?</p>
<p>There is no &ldquo;Fact&rdquo; here, that is just a personal opinion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big first step, just think of how advanced the UI and hardware will be in 5 years &ndash; 10 years.</p>
<p>Yup, that&rsquo;s the most exciting point! This is basicaly a 1.0 device&hellip; Imagine the third or fourth version of this and you can see that Google is really ahead of everyone else in the tech race :)</p>
<p>Thanks! I&rsquo;ll just wait for 10 years to buy and really enjoy this device. Because there&rsquo;s no way this device would last for more than 30 mins. walking around <span class="caps">NYC</span> with <span class="caps">GPS</span> and data or WiFi turned on. Nice concept but the battery technology is not there yet. We complain how our smartphones ran out of juice and they haven&rsquo;t really improve the technology that much since then. I&rsquo;m not in a hurry and let me enjoy my smartphone first for another 9 years then I&rsquo;m ready for this.</p>
<p>wait, why would this last only 30 mins with <span class="caps">GPS</span> and data and a <span class="caps">VERY</span> <span class="caps">TINY</span> screen, when our slim little phones do 10+ hours under the exact same conditions, except with <span class="caps">GIGANTIC</span> <span class="caps">BRIGHT</span> screens?  You&rsquo;re not making any sense, love.</p>
<p>Well, from what little I can tell, it doesn&rsquo;t have much room for a battery. The whole thing looks like it might be near the same size as just the battery on a phone. I have no idea how much power the display technology uses, but even if it&rsquo;s loads less than a smartphone&rsquo;s, it has loads less capacity, too.</p>
<p>The only reason you can get hours of talk time out of a wee little bluetooth headset is because its radio only has to reach 10m. Is Glass tethered to a nearby smartphone, or running its own cellular connection?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>anyone saying its innovative wouldnt be saying that if it wasnt made by google</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s precisely interesting because it comes with the whole Google ecosystem behind it.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;ve read the article then?</p>
<p>Anyone who has kids and sees the Google promo video instantly knows how useful Glass is. I mean, it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;ah ha&rdquo; moment. If I got these I&rsquo;d have hilarious videos to show at least daily but most likely more often.</p>
<p>The important thing is a fact reaction time. What would really make a difference for me is if it can start recording a video or take a photo in under one second.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many shots I&rsquo;ve missed because my digital camera takes 5 seconds to boot up, or my cell phone&rsquo;s camera app is so slow.</p>
<p>Just timed it&hellip; my Note 2 took 9 seconds to go from unlocked (no password) sleep to camera-ready.  Just tried again, with it still in the app &mdash; only had to unlock and snap a pic &mdash; 7 seconds. ~2 to register the button click, ~3 to acknowledge the unlock swipe, and re-do its internal goodies (probably power on the camera chip and such), and about 1 second to register the shutter command, run through autofocus, and take the shot. When you&rsquo;re setting up a photo to sell furniture on Craigslist, that&rsquo;s irrelevant. When you want to capture something embarrassing and adorable that your girlfriend is doing, it&rsquo;s critical.</p>
<p>While watching the video, I was thinking, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;re going to get that little girl in the bubble timed right with a voice command.&rdquo; I wonder how many takes they did.</p>
<p>So if it was made by Apple it would be a great product instead.</p>
<p>I think you are missing the bigger, long term picture here. This is akin to Apple&rsquo;s foray into the mobile world. At first it seemed amazing, but limited.  Touch screens, maps, etc, none of it was new but the package it was in <span class="caps">WAS</span>!  I think once this thing is in the hands of real world users, coupled with Google&rsquo;s obvious desire to perfect this device, you will see amazing innovative third party apps come to life.  Surgeons wearing this with patient vitals accessible at all times. Imagine surgeons conferencing with another surgeon for advice during surgery.  Imagine a dentist doing a root canal pulling up the patients xrays.  Pedestrians getting life saving <span class="caps">CPR</span> info with two free hands. Police using these to quickly scan a Drivers license to access all details on the driver.  Pull up recipes or identify substitutions while you are cooking.  I can imagine a world where this product has so many useful avenues that people will look back 5 years after it&rsquo;s launch and say, &ldquo;how did we manage without it.&rdquo;  Just like we do with smart phones now.</p>
<p>For me it would be accessing presentations while giving them like a teleprompter.</p>
<p>I have hundreds of clients and having all their details in front if me while I am interacting with them (payment history, orders in the system, past buying history, their partners names and so many other things). I would like to have integration into regular glasses like Josh said in the article</p>

<p>Why are you so angry about people liking this? I think that you are an Apple fanboy who just doesn&rsquo;t want to see Google succeed. I just can&rsquo;t understand why it is somehow &lsquo;forbidden&rsquo; to like both Apple and Google products.</p>
<p>As an iPhone user I absolutely love this kind of new technology. Sure, it&rsquo;s not perfect. And it won&rsquo;t be perfect at launch, but it is something and it really looks fresh and new.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is innovation. They are trying out new stuff that could really work well. The first-generation Google Glass will be out this fall and I can&rsquo;t wait to see one in real life.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;m still a bit worried about some things: the camera seems to be underperforming right now. It is definitely awesome, but I feel like picture quality can be much better and video is still too shaky. Also, the thing I worry most about is that using your voice is very important with Google Glass. I&rsquo;d like to see some type of keyboard that you can use by either using the touchpad on the side, or showing a keyboard and just &lsquo;type&rsquo; by looking at a letter.</p>
<p>The second generation of Google Glass is gonna be so much better, but the first-generation Google Glass already seems revolutionary. <em>Compare it to the iPad 1 with the iPad 2: the original iPad lacked multitasking and didn&rsquo;t have a lot of 3rd party apps at launch, while the second iPad was better in every way possible. It was thinner, lighter, faster and most problems were taken care off. That said, the original iPad was/felt revolutionary.</em></p>

<p>Apple fans are not so hatred against Google (and vice versa) but Microsoft/Nokia fans finds Google and Apple such a big threat. So my bet is person in this case does not own iPhone but Windows Phone phone.</p>
<p>Fact is, it just doesn&rsquo;t show you a clock, weather and allow you take pics&hellip;.</p>
<p>It as well allows you to many other things:</p>
<p>1) Take video (not just pics)<br />
2) Do google search<br />
3) Use instant message<br />
4) Do a google+ hangout video<br />
5) Use email<br />
6) Use Google maps for navigation/position<br />
7) Use Google local <br />
8) Use Google translator to translate from one language to other (spoken or written)<br />
9) ?+n<br />
10) <span class="caps">MAKE</span> <span class="caps">LIFE</span> <span class="caps">EASIER</span> ON <span class="caps">MOVE</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">FEATURE</span> ?!</p>
<p>Oh&hellip; and quess what, you can make phonecalls with it later.</p>
<p>And what most people do with their smartphones? Check weather, clock, maps and IM etc? How about taking pictures and videos?</p>
<p>If Google Glasses does about all of what 90% smartphone owners really do with their smartphones, isn&rsquo;t it amazing?<br />
And you still have the smartphone in your pocket to do stuff what you don&rsquo;t do so often like online banking, forum reading, book reading (think about glasses to read you the book when you are on the move instead using earplugs/phones) and many other more complex tasks.</p>
<p>Check out H+: The Digital Series on YouTube! This series touches on the subject of trans-humanism; basically an advanced Google Glass technology as an implanted computer chip in the human brain. The first episode depicts a man watching the football game in his &ldquo;virtual overlay&rdquo; while driving through a parking structure just before something insane happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more innovative than what apple is doing. Apparently &ldquo;Think different&rdquo; means 1 more row of apps and a screen half an inch bigger. And lets not forget that watch of theirs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s actually not the extent of its features so how about knowing what you are talking about before looking like a fool with your incorrect nonsense?</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>, I&rsquo;m an Apple fan.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree. Also, something needs to be said for the fantastic layout of this article. I mean the layouts on Verge features are always great, but sometimes they just go above and beyond what you expect. I don&rsquo;t know another site where it&rsquo;s a joy just to actually look at an article, before you even read it.</p>
<p>Yes, the article, and particularly the video is highly professional and impressive. And frankly, I&rsquo;m kind of freaked, that the future many dreamed about, comes in 2013.</p>
<p>But&hellip; I&rsquo;m wondering if this device can be put to good use. At the moment, it&rsquo;s a toy rather than a useful tool. Every smartphone can give me directions, search on the Internet, take a picture or record a video. But I need a smartphone anyway &ndash; to call someone, or send the <span class="caps">SMS</span>, or check my e-mail, facebook notifications/messages and headlines on The Verge. I don&rsquo;t speak English natively too, and in Poland, voice recognition is kind of awful.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s my point &ndash; why Google Glass, if I still need a smartphone.</p>
<p>First Google sucks you in and then they start invading your privacy. Thanks but no thanks. Besides, who the heck wants to walk around wearing those things??? Hell no.</p>
<p>Every IT giant spies on you. And don&rsquo;t forget about facebook. It&rsquo;s sad but true. And I don&rsquo;t use Google much, mostly because I use Windows and Windows Phone.</p>
<p>But boy I like Google Glass. I like the idea, I like that it may make my life easier. But before it does, software engineers have so much work to do on the speech recognition level, so it will be available to all of us, people. If we don&rsquo;t, Google Glass will remain a toy, useless gadget and nothing more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, the google voice recognition for English is pretty much perfect imo. Even with my very heavy accent, it picks up everything I want to say for google now.</p>
<p>Oh you and your English. I don&rsquo;t care about English, I&rsquo;m Polish! Do you understand there&rsquo;s a world outside the US, UK and Australia?</p>
<p>Do you understand how few people speak polish compared to english or that this device is being developed in the US?</p>
<p>This is discrimination, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Oh please. Get over yourself. Discrimination? Are Polish movies discriminating against rest of the world because they are made in Polish? If you think this is discrimination then I think you live in pretty amazing world.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>No, it isn&rsquo;t discrimination, it&rsquo;s developing for your market with the largest user-base. If the amount of users in China surpassed the users in English speaking countries, Mandarin would be just as good, if not better than English.</p>
<p>There obviously aren&rsquo;t as many engineers in Poland working on the voice recognition, so it won&rsquo;t improve as quickly. Also, the more people using it in any given language, the more data they have to improve the recognition quality.</p>
<p>Really I don&rsquo;t think it has to do with which language has the most speakers (English is 3rd for native tongue) but which language this country was founded and based in, and what is the dominant language spoken in that country. In this case it is English from the US.</p>
<p>True&hellip;but there&rsquo;s more to it than that.  Native speakers of English are not the only speakers of English, and the fact that in most places in the world, English is taught and learned as a second or third language, means that the internet and tech will continue to have an English slant.<br />
The fact that China has more &ldquo;English Speakers&rdquo; than the United States is anecdotal (not at all taking into account the fluency and accuracy of their language production).<br />
Another anecdote is Korea, where since the &rsquo;88 Olympics and the &rsquo;02 World Cup, all signs and most food labels are in printed in both Korean and English.  Most of the people you meet in the cities can be considered &ldquo;English Speakers&rdquo; to some degree, with some people approaching near-native fluency.  Many of the textbooks that they use for <span class="caps">STEM</span> subjects are in English at the university level, and some universities are switching the medium of the course into English, as well.<br />
That being said, I think we can agree that although Chinese and Spanish may have more native speakers, English still asserts a certain dominance as a lingua franca.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not discrimination. Compared to the vast number of English-speakers, Spanish-speakers and Madarin-speakers, basically no-one speaks Polish.</p>
<p>It might suck for you, but Google are unlikely to care. Poland isn&rsquo;t exactly a keystone market and their opinion is going to be &ldquo;well, learn English/Spanish/Chinese like everyone else&rdquo;.</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t tell if you&rsquo;re joking or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one cares about Poland.&rdquo; That was discrimination.</p>
<p>It also was true.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether to like this or not! ;)</p>
<p>Considering Google Translate supports voice to voice translation in multiple languages including Polish, I&rsquo;d imagine the device would support multiple languages provided it becomes a commercial success.</p>
<p>Oh, of course it&rsquo;ll do Polish.  As far as I know Google Voice services already understand Polish.  I think he was just saying they don&rsquo;t understand Polish well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you understand how few people speak polish compared to english</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you understand how few people speak English compared to Chinese?<br />
I guess Chinese should be priority number one.</p>
<p>Yeah try to sell an always on connected device with video recording capabilities to the citizens of China.</p>
<p>You misspelled &ldquo;more&rdquo;.  More people speak English than Chinese.  Not <span class="caps">NATIVELY</span>, mind, but including all people who speak and read the languages at least near-fluently there are definitely more English speakers.</p>
<p>And yet you&rsquo;re reading an article on an English website, written entirely in English, while you write your comments in English.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not worried about myself, I&rsquo;m worried about people who don&rsquo;t speak English.</p>
<p>I doubt Google has forgotten about the rest of the world, hell, this product isn&rsquo;t even finished yet and you&rsquo;re complaining that it won&rsquo;t recognize Polish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll use Google Now, and speech recognition in Google Now won&rsquo;t improve massively over a couple of months.</p>
<p>Yet, I get your point. But my point is, Google should focus on providing better speech recognition in all the world, do not focus on some specific countries. Benefits will be huge for everyone (better speech recognition means better foundation to translation services).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll work at it, just like google translation has improved over the years.</p>
<p>Google Now&rsquo;s speech recognition will definitely improve over a couple of months. Expect a massive boost during Google i/O, and then another around the Nexus event in November.</p>
<p>Of course they are working at it, but translation and voice recognition are incredibly hard. Just have a look at Google Translate. It uses written text, yet it can fail spectacularly. Now add possibility for unclear speech, coloqualisms, regional accents, complex grammar, names (which is one of the hardest things to do) and you multiply the level of difficulty.</p>
<p>It will not happen anytime soon. They will develop this software as quick as possible, but it will target affluent markets and will be easier for simple languages. Coincidentally English speaking countries have both of these advantages. It&rsquo;s just economics and optimizing resource allocation. Same reason why you can&rsquo;t buy a Nexus on the Polish Play Store and use/buy a ton of other products/services.</p>
<p>I think we should let Google decide what they should focus on.  And that is their main target audience.  Progress can&rsquo;t be slowed to a crawl just to keep &ldquo;all the world&rdquo; at the same level. I&rsquo;m sorry if you feel the world isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fair&rdquo;.  But it&rsquo;s what we all have to live with.  If you don&rsquo;t want to learn English to get bleeding edge tech, start developing it yourself.</p>
<p>Your point is exactly wrong.  This device, and others like it, are precisely what will drive the rapid improvement in real time speech recognition and translation world wide.  It&rsquo;s all about markets, dude.</p>
<p>Says you but it could if they wanted it too. It&rsquo;s called purchasing another company that already has better tech.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not going to just forget about the other languages, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of priority. It&rsquo;s disappointing, I&rsquo;m sure, as a non-english speaker but it is also simply a matter of business fact.</p>
<p>There are however easier solutions for non-english speakers that don&rsquo;t involve wishing a giant company would change how they do business&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, I realize how fundamentally lucky I am to not have these problems.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to tell those people to sod off. Just remember to smile while saying it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, there&rsquo;s also Canada. ;)</p>
<p>A very small world with a very small market and a very small corpus. Mandarin is probably a priority.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Canada.</p>
<p>Joking aside I rather like Poland. I can&rsquo;t understand polish at all but it&rsquo;s a neat place.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what he said.</p>

<p><strong>princenoor</strong> said: <em>Even with my very heavy accent, it picks up everything i want to say for google now</em>.,  so i don&rsquo;t think that she speaks english natively. <span class="caps">FWIW</span> you should probably worry more about reading comprehension than <strong>Google Glass</strong> understanding polish</p>
<p>Do you really not understand why English is the first language they target?  If you think a product that only works with the English language is a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; you&rsquo;re insane.</p>
<p>Stop trolling. There is NO other world outside of the US.</p>
<p>You are writing English on an website written in english about an american company. Don&rsquo;t be a prick.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m looking at my Jellybean Android phone, and if I go to Settings&rarr;Language &amp; input &rarr; Voice Search &rarr; Language, I see Polski (Polska).  Have you tried it?</p>
<p>Lol, gonna make a Canada joke but I see that it has already been done.. multiple times</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Worldwide Polish Speakers: 40 million total<br />
World Wide English Speakers: 360 million native plus over 1 billion as a second language and <span class="caps">EFL</span>.</p>
<p>English is a significantly more powerful, influential and global language thus will always take precedence over regional dialects like Polish.</p>
<p>What are you talking about it? Google voice recognition works perfectly in Polish for men. It has issues for women (I have no idea why but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve noticed; probably more men talk to their computers so there is bigger database). A different problem is that Google Now doesn&rsquo;t have even half of features in here.</p>
<p>Poor Canada :(</p>
<p>Edit: and Ireland, and New Zealand, and South Africa&hellip;</p>
<p>Voice recognition: Better than 5 years ago .. Yes. Perfect &hellip;. <span class="caps">AHAHAHAHAHAHA</span> <br />
you&rsquo;re talking nonsense</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/TUeWsgPRI08" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/TUeWsgPRI08</a></p>
<p>Half of fed&rsquo;s request for google&rsquo;s email data are passed on with out <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/US/">warrants</a>. Is this a problem?</p>
<p>When you compare it to other companies it isn&rsquo;t:<br /><a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/when-government-comes-knocking-who-has-your-back" target="_blank">https://www.eff.org/pages/when-government-comes-knocking-who-has-your-back</a></p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s voice recognition works fine with all of the many and varied UK accents that my mates and I have tried. If it can deal with those without a hitch then it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before other languages and dialects of those languages are routinely supported.</p>
<p>right now I <span class="caps">HATE</span> <span class="caps">TOPOLOSKY</span> <span class="caps">BECAUSE</span> I DON"T <span class="caps">HAVE</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span> <span class="caps">AWESOME</span> <span class="caps">THING</span> <span class="caps">CALLED</span> <span class="caps">GOOGLE</span> <span class="caps">GLASSES</span> ON My <span class="caps">FACE</span>!! lol :P. seriously i want this. this really could be the new boundary between sci-fi and reality</p>
<p>Not <em>Google Glasses</em> but <strong>Google Glass</strong>; Google is not a part of the Optometry profession</p>
<p>excellent point</p>
<p>Well apparently he can&rsquo;t imagine you exist&hellip; he doesn&rsquo;t think anyone would ever want to wear it.</p>
<p>how many of them make 99% of their revenue from advertising? oh right only google. google is an advertising <span class="caps">GIANT</span>, hence why i dont want to own their computers.</p>
<p>Why?  There won&rsquo;t be ads displayed on Google Glass (not really enough room even if they wanted to).</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Why does this not have a data connection? isnt that kind of stupid?</p>
<p>if it can use a phones tethering capabilities then who cares ? a wifi is enough. adding more battery sucking devices like data would be detrimental.</p>
<p>I would wear start carrying a dedicated mifi if this thing is worth it, and save phone battery.</p>
<p>i understand it can be tethered but still. May be they didnt want to get into the carrier bullshit.</p>
<p>Battery for the radio would make it unwearable.</p>
<p>it has to be light. always on cellular radios would need you to have a wired battery dangling from your neck. not that it would be too bad if it had magical object identifying capabilities.</p>
<p>Because they have to fit everything into a pair of glasses?</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a beta &amp; they don&rsquo;t want the telcos to get their dirty paws on them until they&rsquo;re ready for primetime <strong><span class="caps">AND</span>/OR</strong> when the demand for them is such that they (telcos) won&rsquo;t be able to demand concessions/compromises (crapware) in functionality in exchange for promotion?</p>
<p>You know whats great! The government doesn&rsquo;t have to watch you because Google does. They just have to get the data afterwards. It&rsquo;s like 1984&hellip;.only that the Telescreens are mobile now (readers of the book will understand). And since every system gets hacked&hellip;.imagine how much fun this will be for hackers&hellip;.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s an illusion, just like freedom. always has been, always will be</p>
<p>Well, aren&rsquo;t we a paranoid android. All companies watch you. Your shopping is monitored, your Internet searches recorded and even your printers send feedback about what they print.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to escape the digital world any time soon, so just stick to being a law-abiding citizen and you&rsquo;ll only have hackers, viruses, abuse of police power, more hackers, stalkers, other stalkers, data corruption and identity theft to fear.</p>
<p>Despite what people say, the government doesn&rsquo;t read your data. It <span class="caps">CAN</span> &ndash; at least in America &ndash; at any time if the company you gave your data to allows it, but 99.9999999% of the time it just gets archived to some dusty server.</p>
<p>Also, your Internet can be and probably isn&rsquo;t watched. However, there are several million demons (programmers will understand) out there, all searching for suspected breaches of cyber-security laws.</p>
<p>I recommend PeerBlock.</p>
<p>Oh, and 1984 was a totalitarian extreme-socialism state. This isn&rsquo;t that. And Google have no right to give your data to the government. Only to other branches of Google.</p>
<p>all companies do not watch you&hellip; .the point is google is the largest ad company on the planet, with doubleclick cookies and chrome web browsers watchign everything you do.</p>
<p>And you think Google will be the only corporation to do this? <br />
They&#8217;re just the first</p>
<p>But through Gmail, Google knows so much about you, and they can tap in to pretty much the whole internet through search and Knowledge Graph. Other people, like Microsoft, even though they have Bing, just don&rsquo;t have that power. Same goes for Apple.</p>
<p>lol, you sound like a eurocrat. Just force google to pay for the links it provides and I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ll cange your tune pretty quick.</p>
<p>Mostly because Apple and Microsoft have never thought to do something that&rsquo;s so borderline invasive. Even if it&rsquo;s invasive in a good way, you can&rsquo;t help that there are going to be a few people that are just like &lsquo;&rsquo;whoa that&rsquo;s weird&rsquo;&rsquo;. Kind of like the intelligent toilets than can measure glucose levels in urine and stool and take some of your other vitals &ndash; incredibly useful, but kinda weird at the same time.</p>
<p>But then again a lot of electronics and inventions/ideas are viewed in that light when they first come on the scene, after some time then everyone gets used to it. Google is just the first one to do it, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be the last.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s absolutely true!</p>
<p>I believe Google&rsquo;s privacy strategy hurts their brand. Whatevery they do will become more and more difficult, because their brand is at the core of everything Google does. Their reputation may already be bad enough to scare peope away even from an interesting innovation like Google Glasses. People see Google Glasses <span class="caps">PLUS</span> the Google brand. And the brand is connected to things like: find everything, collect private data, show ads, appear everywhere you don&rsquo;t expect (like ads). It is probably impossible to associate Google&rsquo;s brand with trust. Perhaps that&rsquo;s a direct result of their core business: ads. To me, Google seems to be in the state of denial. They are rushing forward as fast as they can, but one day their reputation will catch them. Shiny gimmicks are perceived in the light of their (future) brand and may look much worse than they are. Then, an other company will come, do the same thing, have a good brand, and everybody will hail them. We have already seen that in tech world&hellip; haven&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>They are not the first. The first was 20 years ago and called CyberTraveller.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t even the first. They&rsquo;re just the first to make it into a neat wearable screen.</p>
<p>Why the heck does it matter if someone &#8220;invades your privacy&#8221; if no human sees it and it is anonymized?</p>
<p>google humans see  a lot<br /><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369188,00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2369188,00.asp</a></p>
<p>So having a huge database containing a metric sh*t-ton of information about people is not a problem because no human is looking forward on a day-to-day basis? What about leaks, or government intrusion?</p>
<p>Remember when people said that you wouldn&rsquo;t want just a touch screen phone&hellip;just saying.</p>
<p>Do you know what <span class="caps">ISP</span>/Carrier knows about you and what information it sells/gives from you to advertisers and government agencies without your aprooval? More than what Google ever gets from you even if you would be 100% Google customer.</p>
<p>Do you know how much a banks and bonus card systems knows about you? Whoa&hellip; scary things&hellip;</p>
<p>Are you one of those who are not hypocrites by just using cash, using mail only, use encrypted phones if a must to use phone and otherwise does face to face meetings in randomly chosen secure locations etc?</p>
<p>Can you be classified as person who whines about no one can not use <span class="caps">WWW</span> or even whole internet without Google etc?</p>
<p>I feel like you are missing the point. Yes your smartphone can do those things, but you are tethered to it, needing to take it out to take pictures, search get directions. Glass is a movement to un-tether us from such interactions. The video stated it perfectly, it&rsquo;s sort of odd we have created a paradox where to be more intimate and disconnect from technology, we have to augment ourselves with persistent technology.</p>
<p>This idea that because a smartphone can accomplish the same tasks as glass is completely irrelevant as to it&rsquo;s usefulness. I can say I already had a <span class="caps">GPS</span>, but a phone is better. I can say I have a watch, so the smartphone doesn&rsquo;t need to show time. Everything is an improvement on a previous activity in some way. I feel that Glass is an improvement over how we currently interact with a smartphone.</p>
<p>I for one can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Conversely, wearing glasses sucks. I try to wear my contacts 99% of the day just because glasses in rain are so fucking awful, nevermind how impractical they are and how easily they get filthy. Glass is much more integrated from a tech standpoint, but from a practical standpoint it&rsquo;s superhairy, unwashed balls. They&rsquo;ve attached 21st century tech to 18th century tech and the tech suffers for it.</p>
<p>Glass, as ironic as it may be, does not have glasses. I think it comes with a sunglasses accessory, but the thing is just a frame for the display, no actual glasses in the way. Didn&rsquo;t you even read the article? Or at least watched the video?</p>
<p>So you honestly think that wearing something like that will somehow be completely different from the experience of wearing eyeglasses? You think that it wouldn&rsquo;t be subject to the same environmental factors as eyeglasses, that it wouldn&rsquo;t suck to to have a structure like that sitting on your face all day? My experience with eyeglasses is that they are a pain in the ass to wear. Why would I want to wear something with an identical structure voluntarily? It&rsquo;s a crappy experience.</p>
<p>All the weight of glasses are in the glass.  Ironically(?), Glass has almost no glass and should in theory be very light weight were it&rsquo;s more like a watch on your wrist you forget you have on.</p>
<p>ymmv, I wear glasses all day and it feels weird not to.  Sometimes I touch my face just to make sure they&rsquo;re still there (which is silly because I&rsquo;d notice them missing due to my degraded vision).  I could <span class="caps">NEVER</span> do contacts.  Could never stick a finger in my eyes at least twice a day.  Tossing glasses on and off seems much much easier.  To me.  Personally if I could attach Glass to my prescription glasses (which I assume is an eventuality) I would only ever take them off to shower and sleep.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worn eye glasses for most of my life. They are as comfortable on me as the rest of the clothes I wear.</p>
<p>Now I on the other hand cannot have anything hanging off of my belt&hellip; I guess some people simply cannot tolerate certain things.</p>
<p>Google Glass would improve a lot in many people lifes. Example how about people who have just a one hand to use? Many doesn&rsquo;t understand that how hard it is to live with only one hand to be used. And if you are left handed then, you can not use cameras as there is only maybe 1-2 models somewhere what exists for left handed people. Smartphones can be rotated but to use it with one hand to take pictures is not possible either.<br />
And what then when you are using that hand for something else? Like you carry a bag or you are holding someones hand?</p>
<p>For many person the small motion to rise head and then say &ldquo;Ok Glass, where I am?&rdquo; and it would show you your location on map would be huge improvement.</p>
<p>I do hope that glass can be turned to left side as for most right handed people the left eye is the dominant and easier to use but&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree from a consumer perspective this kind of tech just isnt there. (maybe in 10 years) But from a professional perspective it could be really useful now. Point of view video sharing (hangouts) would solve a lot of real-time troubleshooting problems, esp with high tech items and health care. For example if an engineer is having problems installing a complicated system, just call tech support with google glass and they can see what you see instantly. Or maybe doctors can use this if they are having trouble diagnosing a patient say in LA they can &ldquo;hangout&rdquo; with a specilist in Europe via google glass and get help.</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point of a hangout if they can only see what you&rsquo;re seeing but can&rsquo;t see you? Isn&rsquo;t the point of a hangout (or video chatting) is to talk face to face?</p>
<p>No. The point, in this case, is that they get to see what you see. If the person is trying to help you out it is more beneficial for them to have access to your problem than your face. They can still hear you and communicate with you.</p>
<p>who wants to &lsquo;hangout&rsquo; and view random walls/tables/chairs/other people/anything else but the other participants in the hangout????</p>
<p>Did you even read the comment you replied to? He clearly specified a great use case &ndash; troubleshooting. On top of that, the second video in this very article shows some great use cases. It&rsquo;s a great tool for showing people something cool and interesting you&rsquo;r doing, like flying a plane, showing relatives your party, streaming a concert live, etc. For normal Hangouts you&rsquo;ve still got you&rsquo;re phone/table/computer.</p>
<p>You could just look into a mirror like he does in the first shot and nod to yourself while thinking &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so cool&rdquo; then they could see you</p>
<p>If your Glasses are connected via WiFi in a home then it&rsquo;s not as easy to find a mirror nearby in all rooms of the house.</p>
<p>If your Glasses  are connected with your smartphone over 3G/4G, then you may be able to just switch to the camera(s) on your smartphone for the Hangout (which is the standard way of doing it)</p>
<p>The one side for group chat is that everyone can see each other.</p>
<p>But the other side is that everyone can see what others are seeing.<br />
Example think about when people are in mal, searching something together as present for someone. You can just discuss normally and if someone sees something nice, it can be presented to others easily.</p>
<p>Or when people are in party/concert etc they can see different viewpoints.<br />
Example think about friends being watching a rally or other sport in different positions, you can get wider idea what is happening.</p>
<p>And that can be very well applied to multiple different work, from freelancers to engineers. Firefighters and police strike teams already have these in use so commanding officier can see what everyone is seeing and get better idea what is happening.</p>
<p>There are already a millitary tests done for this kind gear for engineers where computer highlights the parts in their vision in real time and include check list step-by-step how to work and what tools to use.<br />
In tests engineers work speed improved over 60% as they didn&rsquo;t need to use manual or checklists on paper. And even if then got to situation that they didn&rsquo;t know what to do, they got direct line to manufacturer where engineer could see that situation and could guide trough phone in special cases.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it will become a &lsquo;black box&rsquo; for surgeons and that could cause problems, considering that the US has never fixed its liability issues and has barely fixed health care economics.</p>
<p>great for when you get stopped by the <del>gestapo</del> police for have a tail-light out. Just in case&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget about filming meteors!</p>
<p>lol. we&rsquo;ll never catch up to the Russians in that discipline!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a general problem with Google products, they are all extremely US centric. I can&rsquo;t blame them for having no support for Polish voice recognition, because the market is tiny, both in size and purchasing power when compared to US.  On top of that our language is flexive and much more complex so way harder to decipher and recognize. Google Glass is right now a camera with Hangout and Google Now integration. I&rsquo;ve seen how nice Google Now can work in <span class="caps">USA</span>, but here it&rsquo;s pretty poor.</p>
<p>Ignoring language and location problems (let&rsquo;s move to the US :P), the whole point of Glass is that you need to interact with your smartphone much less. <br />
You have <br />
- the option to do voice search and have the results read out, although it is not something I&rsquo;d like to do often in public <br />
- you have the camera with you, no need to search for the phone and launch the app<br />
- no need to look at a screen to get direction since you have an overlay<br />
- no need to check for notifications and alerts<br />
- many other things that we haven&rsquo;t thought of yet</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Voice recognition from Google every day in Poland. What the hell is with this <span class="caps">FUD</span>? On top of that, I used it first time nearly 3 years ago, when I got Samsung Galaxy S.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment, it&rsquo;s a toy rather than a useful tool. Every smartphone can give me directions, search on the Internet, take a picture or record a video. But I need a smartphone anyway&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A person could have said the same thing about smartphones ten years ago, correct?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every laptop computer can do X, Y, and Z that a phone can do. But I need a laptop anyway, so why would I want a phone that is also a computer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smartphones caught on because they took existing functionality and made it available in a more convenient and ubiquitous form: instead of &ldquo;a thing inside your briefcase,&rdquo; a computing device became &ldquo;a thing inside your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google Glass is, potentially, just the next step. Now, a computing device isn&rsquo;t even something you have to fish out of your pocket &ndash; it&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re already looking at.</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the ability of a new and more portable form factor to unlock new possibilities because we&rsquo;ve seen this many times in the past. Think about portable music players, portable computers, and even portable insulin pumps and other medical devices. There have been a lot of these mini-revolutions!</p>
<p>Right. Just duct tape your Nexus 4 to your temple and you&rsquo;re all set. No need for any of this malarkey!</p>
<p>It seems to do what Josh said which is &ldquo;augment&rdquo; what you currently have. But, I agree, the usefulness of this seems&hellip; gimmicky, to an extent.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine myself wearing these around town, but the one scenario I could see myself using glass a lot for is driving.  Having a screen in you field of view at all times seems much safer than looking down at phone, even if it&rsquo;s on your dash.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Viewing <span class="caps">GPS</span> directions</li>
	<li>Reading incoming texts (we&rsquo;re all guilty of at least an occasional glance at the phone for this&hellip;)</li>
	<li>See who&rsquo;s calling me</li>
	<li>Control music/podcasts playing on my phone</li>
	<li>Take video/picture of the jerk who cut me off</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus points for being able to quicly photograph their license plate</p>
<p>I think the idea is that at some point in the future, Glass will inherently replace a smartphone.  After all, they&rsquo;re basically just moving the screen from being held in your hands to now being placed in front of your eye.</p>
<p>The future has not yet come for one reason and one reason alone.</p>
<p>We do not yet have the flying cars and hoverboards from back to the future.</p>
<p>Brad Pitt is 49. This article is a sham.</p>
<p>Oh my God it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Polygon :P   But they are sister sites.</p>
<p>iMore.com has extremely high quality writing</p>
<p>I honestly couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>LIke: &ldquo;And she has extremely red hair.&rdquo; Hmm a smidgeon facile I suspect &hellip;</p>
<p>I agree. The content, the video production quality and the interviews are the best in the biz, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Plus, Topolsky&rsquo;s hair is improving as well, which I am jealous of.</p>
<p>I agree this article was spectacular, the same goes for the video and after reading this article I am more excited about Glass. Josh makes me wanna head out to Google&rsquo;s New York City headquarters and try glass myself.</p>
<p>Best part: Available <span class="caps">THIS</span> year!.<br /><img title="" src="http://dyingread.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/baby-meme.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Vuzix M100 is also available this summer though I guess it wont be tied to all Google services (or maybe it will be &ndash; it does run Android).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen the original of this photo.</p>
<p>Well written article. Nice pictures. Great layout.<br />
And most of all ; just want to say: Well Done Google! Creativity and Innovation done right. This stuff is amazing.</p>
<p>Cool, you&rsquo;ve copied my avatar from six months ago, only low-res and uglier.</p>
<p>Mine was forcedly removed by a moderator, without the elementary courtesy of warning me or asking me to replace it myself. I expect the same will happen to you.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>Kind of can&rsquo;t believe this stuff is real.</p>
<p>Looking like the next James Bond at the top :D</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s looking incredibly sharp. I bet it&rsquo;s because of the Glass. I want the Glass. I <span class="caps">NEED</span> IT!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s honestly just as stupid looking as a bluetooth headset&hellip; but way more awesome and efficient in terms of use.</p>
<p>I feel like&hellip;..this would only be successful if it could some how be intergrated into normal glasses and not bought a  seperate product.</p>
<p>Like I walk into Sunglass Hut to check out a pair or shades I like and the representative there says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s also a Google Glass version&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That is what makes sense to me. That way I don&rsquo;t look weird. I&rsquo;m not buying a serperate product but a product integrated into something I was already going to buy. I mean if the idea is to give me tech without getting in the way, no one will notice a pair of sunglasses on my face. People will, without a doubt, notice this.</p>
<p>I imagine that v 2.x or x.x will be a module that can be mounted onto almost any glasses frame.  I cannot wait for the Oakley version.  I&rsquo;ve already wadded up all my money to throw it at the Goggle Brick and Mortar staff!</p>
<p>Imagine if it were designed to be detached from the frame and attached to other frames that are made for it&hellip;.did you even read the article?</p>
<p>I mean have the tech built into a <span class="caps">NORMAL</span> pair of glasses and have the info (google glass) appear within the actual lens&hellip;..like a hud. Not switch frames and still have a sky blue piece wrapped around my ear. Specifically for people who already wear glasses (like Josh), they can just buy a version with the tech built into it.</p>
<p>Ah I see. I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s the only way it&rsquo;ll be successful&hellip;but it would be pretty neat.</p>
<p>Yeah that would be awesome but you have to remember what may not seem normal today might be totally awesome and common tomorrow. I&rsquo;m sure when the first people wore regular glasses they were all stared at heavily. Maybe eventually technology like this will become the norm as far as wearable tech but I have to agree it would be much better if the technology could be implemented into existing hardware.</p>
<p>A Bluetooth headset at least has a purpose. I&#8217;m still struggling to figure out what the point of Glass is.</p>
<p>hmm&hellip; there are going to be many interseting things you can do with Google Glasses:</p>
<p>Rent  piano lessions over the internet without the need of a teacher sitting next to you</p>
<p>have face detection for everybody you know so Google Glasses can alarm you when this person crosses your way :)</p>
<p>Wearing an other pair of glasses behind your head and stream the video to your eyes so you miss nothing.</p>
<p>Perhaps have a 360 degree view around your head with a special hat, like&hellip; uhm&hellip; a fat spider :)</p>
<p>Have an infra red picture of your environment streamed to your eyes so you can see if the the biological reaction of your favourite girl when she sees you (additional feature: lie detector)</p>
<p>Shot a video from a person threading you with a pistol right to the police, or making it possible at least, so that people with google glass are less likely to be robbed. :-)</p>
<p>And stuff like that&hellip;</p>
<p>Mission impossible had this same thing in glasses I think.  The first tom cruise movie iirc?</p>
<p>And James Bond decades ago and many sci-fi movie/serie from 1970 to this time etc.</p>
<p>Problem just have been that digital cameras have not been small enough with good enough resolution, framerate and power consumption and for low price.</p>
<p>Then when we get rotating camera element and eye movement tracker so secondary camera will have a zoomed view to position where person is watching, it can become even more terrifying. <br />
And if it just would be possible to get full view live video, then getting 10-15x zoomed video would allow scary possibilities to spy by avarage people without carrying any device on hand.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for version 2.0. The first thing I thought of after reading this piece was that they should make it constantly record and then you can say, &ldquo;ok glass, save that moment&rdquo; and it saves the past 30 seconds or whatever. Of course that would increase the privacy issues.</p>
<p>Makes sense. Thought of this too.</p>
<p>Pretty random, but on my commute home the other day, I glanced to the side briefly and saw a crow eating a rabbit in the middle of the city. My immediate thought was, &ldquo;Did I just see that?&rdquo; In the future, you&rsquo;ll just say that out loud and Glass will give you an instant replay.</p>
<p>This will be like Russian dash cam 2.0 on Youtube. Wait a minute&hellip;Youtube&hellip;Wow that&rsquo;s why they are making the Glass!</p>
<p>Yeah, the Russians are going to love this.  Especially Putin.</p>
<p>probably every government will love this. They can save lots of surveillance cameras. <span class="caps">OMG</span>, this is going to be a home run for Google!</p>
<p>Mainframe manufacturers are the ones who are going to love this as intelligence agencies and police needs more computing power to do face recognition for all cameras on streets. ;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in seeing if this is what they will sell at a consumer level, or if 2.0 is what we actually start to get.</p>
<p>This is the Explorer model: meaning it is a polished prototype, but still a prototype.  Anybody that signs up for it now and gets into the explorer program will be receiving this version, but the model that will actually be sold publicly will essentially be 2.0.</p>
<p>If this is a prototype wouldn&rsquo;t the product that&rsquo;s actually being sold to the public be version 1.0?</p>
<p>but this is sold, 1500 smackers. developer <em>prototypes</em> are usually given free for a very select group of partner companies&hellip; not sold. this is sold, more so than certain ferrari models.</p>
<p>I would bet they&rsquo;ve given a few of these out for free already to select developers.</p>
<p>Versio 1.0 doesn&rsquo;t mean it is stable, secure etc but usually just that it has all wanted features.</p>
<p>Example difference of 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 is just that versio number, not about stability or even features. As someone can make a product and release 0.1 version of it and then later just implement new features and get 0.2 or 0.3, so people knows 0.1+n is newer than 0.1 version.</p>
<p>Saying &ldquo;I am waiting 2.0 of product X&rdquo; is just based idea what propaganda has feed to people in software markets".</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty convinced that the people buying the explorer model will receive the consumer version as well, for free. Google usually does things like this, and it makes sense since essentially you will be providing Google a service by making the device better. With any other company, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so sure, but Google usually is good about this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>Battery issues would be the only problem. If we can eliminate that, then an always on camera would be more feasible.</p>
<p>This. The recording feature looks great, but more often than not that moment you want captured is a surprise. A constant record / scrub feature would make this a whole lot more game changing.</p>
<p>Remember that number you wrote? When that crazy snake came out of knowhere? When your kid said their first word? <span class="caps">THAT</span> would be game-changing.</p>
<p>That would be incredible. Capturing &ldquo;first&rdquo; moments would be&hellip; amazing. You might not be recording when something amazing happens, but if it could be constantly recording, and you could &ldquo;rewind&rdquo; your life? It would be a whole new world.</p>
<p>and yet &lsquo;memories&rsquo;, kind of the best concept of life gets blown away. You don&rsquo;t need a brain anymore so to speak&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to have the best moments recorded with some kind of glasses or anything else, wanna go through past events thinking of them with my head and dreaming how great or bad they were. This is the true beauty of life. Getting disconnected from your true deep self isn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>This is the case already with people.</p>
<p>They go to concert and they shoot out videos there. Then they go home and they watch those concerts from computer/smartphone screen and they try to live again the experience. Many smarter one has learned that when they go to Live concert, don&rsquo;t use any recording device on your hands, just experience the <span class="caps">LIVE</span> show.</p>
<p>But still, this Google Glass thing nice neat feature is, you actually don&rsquo;t even anymore watch the happening trough small display but you watch and you experience it.</p>
<p>Then you can just move the video to <span class="caps">HDD</span> and get it automatically backed up. <br />
Then years ago when memory starts to fade, you can pull the video of that situation.</p>
<p>What I can see soon singles saying:&ldquo;When I wake up in bed next to unknown person, I can just ask glasses to rewind marked position and hear the person introducing. No more ackward situations when in morning you don&rsquo;t anymore remember other name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That thought honestly gives me chills. To record the moments you didn&rsquo;t know you wanted to record. That is the future. My kids are growing up so fast, and trying to grab a phone to take a picture or record video&hellip;..I miss more than I get. Man I want Glass something awful.</p>
<p>Do you really want your entire family history and your child&rsquo;s first steps to be uploaded onto Google&rsquo;s servers? Because given Google&rsquo;s current business model of shipping Chromebooks with TBs of server space and the physical storage limit of a device so small, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that&rsquo;s where it would go.</p>
<p>Not trying to be alarmist, but if people think drones are breaching personal liberty, this takes it to a whole new level.</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve got the liberty to delete all/most of your Google data with the click of a button in account settings and download it to a hard drive for safe keeping. Google lets you do that, none of the other big players do.</p>
<p>Think of the activism uses for this as well. Documenting police misdemeanors, private protest hangouts, instantaneous access to your rights and the law or notification of your counsel upon arrest. Technology is not good or evil, how we use it defines that in a human context. Drones are not evil or a threat to liberty, many drones are used for civilian research purposes and legitimate law enforcement, but many more are used to wage illegal wars or invade privacy. The problem isn&rsquo;t the drones, it&rsquo;s the illegal conflicts and privacy invasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drones are not evil or a threat to liberty, many drones are used for civilian research purposes and legitimate law enforcement&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip; no. Like we really need <em>that</em> for &ldquo;legitimate law enforcement&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;.yes?  Actually that would be <span class="caps">VERY</span> useful.  A series of at-the-ready drones would likely be <span class="caps">MUCH</span> less expensive than running a series of full-sized helicopters for aerial tracking during chases.  Just as an example.</p>
<p>Its like the whole &ldquo;guns don&rsquo;t kill people, people kill people.&rdquo;  Except its &ldquo;drones don&rsquo;t infringe your liberties, assholes with drones infringe your liberties.&rdquo;  Incidentally I&rsquo;m part of a Makerspace and we have <span class="caps">DOZENS</span> of quad- and hexi-copters, many of which are big and smart enough to be considered &ldquo;drones&rdquo;.  A few even have on-board video.  None of those drones are infringing anyone&rsquo;s liberties.</p>
<p>I think its likely that the implementation would be similar to the <span class="caps">HTC</span> One camera or the Playstation 4 gaming recording, where it stores a constant stream to a local buffer, but drops it after a rolling 15 minute period.  That would eliminate the privacy concerns you highlighted (of course, not all of them) and you wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about pushing all the data back and forth which would kill the phone and the glasses battery..</p>
<p>Comparing this to drones is idiotic&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you really want your entire family history and your child&rsquo;s first steps to be uploaded onto Google&rsquo;s servers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And why do you think they are uploaded to anywhere?<br />
They are kept in your smatphone, in your physical storage and from there you can upload them to any video service you want, even to youtube if so.</p>
<p>And Google does not want to enable by default any real time upload, it is optional function.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already possible. It would just require <span class="caps">MASSIVE</span> amounts of memory. <br />
You would need to be constantly recording at a quality consumers would consider acceptable, for a long enough time (say 5-10 seconds), constantly buffer and refresh that data it in the memory (probably something like every millisecond) and have it ready to access and store in permanent storage. <br />
The processing power alone to be doing that would drain battery life faster than my girlfriend drains my bank account, let alone the cost of adding the fixed storage separate to the main system storage.<br />
I speak having worked low level on high speed, deep packet inspection network cards (with constant supplied power) that buffer (up to 4 seconds) of data at all times.</p>
<p>Exactly. Plus it wouldn&rsquo;t be using mechanical storage but solid state storage so then we begin to run into the issue of r/w degradation of the <span class="caps">NAND</span> itself.</p>
<p>You can just use normal <span class="caps">RAM</span>, especially at current prices and the minuscule resolution of these videos.  If its a buffer for a rolling period of time (like 2 minutes), you wouldn&rsquo;t need data persistence through power cycles.  That does nothing to solve the other issues highlighted, power consumption is the real non starter.</p>
<p>It actually doesn&rsquo;t need so much memory to buffer a 5-10 seconds of 480p with fairly good compression and then throw away always the last few seconds in few secods periods.</p>
<p>If by <span class="caps">MASSIVE</span> you mean over 2MB then you are correct, but if you mean over 64MB then no&hellip;</p>
<p>If done correctly by using HW encoder for video to capture and cache video stream, it doesn&rsquo;t need a much memory but power consumption is huge (the device size and purpose to wield whole day).</p>
<p>But if anykind <span class="caps">CPU</span> needs to compression then it slows down and needs more memory power.</p>
<p>Comparing to networking, it doesn&rsquo;t work so well as the cases are totally different.<br />
We are not talking about huge amount of random and small packages in 100Mbits and up networking here (like thinking why 1Gbs networks are useless in home computer as <span class="caps">CPU</span> can not manage full speed at all)</p>
<p>If glasses would need to cache 1080p video with 60 frames per second for 5-10 seconds without good compression, then I can agree that it goes way too high for what is needed in size of those glasses.</p>
<p>But technology is there. Example 8 years ago we already got digital cameras (<span class="caps">DSLR</span>) to shoot 12MPix <span class="caps">RAW</span> 14 frames per second up 40 frames (to 2-3 seconds) and then emptying cache same time to CF card (at that time about 3MB/s), what is way over 1080p (2Mpix).</p>
<p>32-128MB MicroSD card is not hard to fit to that size and to have 128-512MB DDR3 isn&rsquo;t either and processor compressing video isn&rsquo;t big either and together they are small compact size. But power consumption is huge if you would need to do that whole day :-D</p>
<p>Yes, best comment on this subject.</p>
<p>A feature similar to the PS4&rsquo;s constant recording would be excellent.  I guess fitting the technology in the glasses might be a problem but time will take care of that.</p>
<p>Have you read Speaker for the Dead?   Card the visionary!</p>
<p>That would also kill the battery pretty quickly.</p>
<p>You do remember the Looxcie don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>Actually that already exists. The bluetooth camera headset Looxcie does that, having a constant video buffer of the last 30 seconds that you can save. However their new website kinda sucks and this feature is a bit hidden: third paragraph of <a href="http://www.looxcie.com/discover-looxcie/" target="_blank">http://www.looxcie.com/discover-looxcie/</a>. Never tried it personally though.</p>
<p>This integrated with Google now and Android sorta makes the iWatch rather moot doesn&rsquo;t it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard some iWatch rumors that make it out to be much more than a iPhone watch. The power of wearable computing will be in actually augmenting your experience, not just offering a slight convenience. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imsmart.com/en" target="_blank">http://www.imsmart.com/en</a></p>
<p>you seem to have used both to know this?</p>
<p>very different products, it seems.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it has to come from Apple, but I would much rather have an elegant/classy smartwatch with Google Now/Siri functionality than any sort of device I would have to strap to my face &mdash; particularly since I don&rsquo;t wear prescription glasses and therefore, when I&rsquo;m not outdoors during the day, wearing my hypothetical Google sunglasses (meaning 90% of the day), I no longer have the ability to use the Glass technology.  I mean, you can&rsquo;t expect me to wear that empty framework indoors/at night just so I can get notifications and take pictures&hellip;</p>
<p>Well both Apple and Google are reportedly working on smartwatches right now, so you might not have to wait too long.  :)</p>
<p>I would rather have a minimally obtrusive iWatch on my hand than a Glass taking over my face</p>
<p>By next year, there will be even more pictures flooding into the <a href="http://www.peopleofwalmart.com/">people of walmart</a> site.</p>
<p>I see Google&rsquo;s strategy now. They all watched Minority Report.</p>
<p>Cars that drive themselves, interfaces that pop up in front of you without a phone. All we need to do is adopt it. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so happy that Google is based in California. Our state is always open for cutting edge when it comes to adopting the newest technology. Too bad we suck at everything else. But hell we have good beaches.</p>

<p>One step closer to this&hellip;.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y152/calidan777/halo4hud.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>All I need now is a Cortana&hellip;.Siri is not gonna cut it&hellip;.</p>
<p>And some Mark IV armor.</p>
<p>Wonder if you could change the &ldquo;Ok Glass&rdquo; phrase to &ldquo;Ok Cortana&rdquo;?<br />
They also need to make a Master Chief Green colour &ndash; I&rsquo;d buy</p>
<p>you would need root.</p>
<p>I would be down more with saying &ldquo;Ok Jarvis&rdquo; and a red and gold version.</p>
<p>Jarvis would be awesome, as long as I&rsquo;d get back some sarcasm in return for anything I asked.</p>
<p>I would actually prefer to where something on the lines of these.  If you have a prescription it seems easier to make the front glass part all RX.  Then anything displayed would just be over laid on the glass part.</p>
<p>A whole lot of swagger; stupendous</p>
<p>&ldquo;swagger&rdquo;</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>Swagger is awesome. Swag is bad. Swagger, a significantly older word, should not have to suffer association with swag.</p>
<p>No. Both are terrible.</p>
<p>Swagger in this case could be appropriate if Topolsky was walking in a confident manner. As for swag (which has been altered drastically), it would also be appropriate if Topolsky were to keep the Glass he was using. It being any one of these: loot &ndash; booty &ndash; spoil &ndash; plunder.</p>
<p>However, I do agree both current-day uses are pretty bad.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for these to get smaller.</p>
<p>This is the key. This type of technology won&rsquo;t  be popular until you have to look closely to notice that the person isn&rsquo;t wearing normal glasses.</p>
<p>it won&rsquo;t be mass market, no, but at least the initial impressions aren&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s a steaming turd. One caveat, the initial impressions of the Atrix made out it would change the game. It&rsquo;s shortfalls were never overcome.</p>
<p>exactly, they&rsquo;re just too bulky currently that I&rsquo;d be willing to wear them out in public. Maybe a redesign would fix that, who really knows. Actually, if they could get the display to be behind the lenses I think that would help a lot.</p>
<p>Not necessarily. Some people want others to know they&rsquo;re using something special. The Prius continues to sell incredibly well despite its very unique design.</p>
<p>the difference for me is that I actually like the design of the Prius. If you like glass than awesome for you, I&rsquo;m just hoping more designers get their hands on it. Oakleys with glass or ray bans with glass sound like a possibly great future to me.</p>
<p>The Verge had an article earlier in the week reporting that Google was working with Warby Parker on industrial design. So I wouldn&rsquo;t worry too much about it. Especially since these are something so small and will be relatively cheap (compared to a car, that is) I imagine they will have multiple styles available, eventually.</p>
<p>yeah I have 20/20 vision so I don&rsquo;t have to wear glasses. I&rsquo;d rather not have to wear a pair (and have to pay for tethering) just so I don&rsquo;t have to look down at my phone once in a while when outside walking around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not tethering, it&rsquo;s bluetooth, it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bluetooth tethering since you&rsquo;re using your phone as a pass through to connect to the Internet and no I don&rsquo;t think it would be free.  At least in the U.S. with most service providers you&rsquo;ll end up paying extra for tethering unless you jailbreak/root your phone.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t pay more for bluetooth tethering. It&rsquo;s free. I do it all the time on my stock Droid X (Verizon) with my Xoom.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just wifi tethering that you will pay more for.</p>
<p>Having clear glasses with no prescription and a UV filter on them is actually really nice.  They make them for computers, and it keeps the wind out of your eyes outside.  Expect some kind of transition style sunglass setup with them.</p>
<p>I disagree. I think there is a substantial amount of people who would love the attention this device would create. At that point it will stop being weird and people will start using it more. Kind of like the first people with a smart phone, or a tablet on the <span class="caps">NYC</span> subway.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot like crotchless panties.</p>

<p>wow, the future is finally coming back</p>
<p>I told our hosts from Google to take my money multiple times, but alas I will have to wait like everyone else.</p>
<p>Did you throw it at them? Cause if you didn&rsquo;t throw it at them they probably didn&rsquo;t understand how much you wanted a pair.</p>
<p>I definitely waved my wallet around and may have been crying slightly.</p>
<p>Only grown men have the balls to admit they cried.</p>
<p>You, sir, have proved to be a man.</p>
<p>Gotta make it rain!</p>
<p>Next time do come with a lot of $5 bills and take a pic of you throwing the bills at them.</p>
<p>ur title reminds me of dwiight schrute in the office. assistant to the manager :)</p>
<p>Also gotta remember to tell them to shut up first.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/dRUhUpM.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Its funny when you realize how relevant this gif actually is.</p>
<p>So are people with prescription glasses basically screwed when it comes to Glass?</p>
<p>No they&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
<p>In other words, we&rsquo;re screwed for at least the first iteration. Because they want to hit retail shelves by the end of the year, so major features have to be finished up within the next couple of months. Otherwise they aren&rsquo;t going to have enough time to test anything before it hits production some three or so months before shipping.</p>
<p>or uh contacts?</p>
<p>There are a lot of people with eyes that don&rsquo;t really accept contacts.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s unfamiliar with the point-eyeball struggle.  I wish I could wear contacts, eye shape won&rsquo;t keep them in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been wearing contacts for years, but lately my eyes are sore all the time and no doctor can figure out what&rsquo;s causing it. Wearing contacts with sore eyes is not a good idea, so i might need to accept i&rsquo;ll be wearing glasses for the rest of my life instead.</p>
<p>But even people who can wear contacts are going to have infections or inflammations from time to time. That&rsquo;d be an interesting future when everyone is using Glass and the one with an infection needs to revert to using a smartphone for two weeks :D</p>
<p>Indeed. Before I got my eyes fixed, I scratched my cornea but did not have a spare pair of glasses to wear. I tried to endure the pain, but let me just make this clear, it&rsquo;s not possible. I lasted about an hour of my eyes watering and in pain before I took the contacts out and went around pretty much blind. I used to be unable to see things that were more than a foot away from my face.</p>
<p>Pretty sure the <span class="caps">CIA</span> has those.</p>
<p>The whole Warby Parker thing suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>Yes.  It&rsquo;s impossible to put Glass on a frame with prescription glasses.  The material is just too different.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>The major problem I see is getting the partners in line to add lenses to these glasses. I mean they make the highest percentage of their money of of the frame, not the lens.</p>
<p>Great article &hellip; I will wait for the superior version from futurama though.<br /><img title="" src="http://c4universe.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/eyePhone-Futurama-238x238.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a twit now. &ndash; Mom</p>
<p>Lol. Gotta love anything that lets you say something like that. Now if you&rsquo;ll excuse me. [grabs wallet and chucks it at monitor]</p>
<p>Anything happen?</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s got an <span class="caps">LCD</span> with a few missing pixels&hellip;</p>
<p>Yep, it bounced back. But fret not! I have a dual monitor setup at work. [proceeds to chuck wallet at second monitor]</p>
<p>In other news, I now have something to do today. Two somethings actually. 1. Come up with a presentation to convince my boss why it&rsquo;s in the company&rsquo;s best interest to send me to Google I/O. 2. Come up with a presentation for why it&rsquo;s in the company&rsquo;s best interest to get me Google Glass when it&rsquo;s released (which they&rsquo;ll let me keep when/if I&rsquo;m terminated).</p>
<p>Notice how the futurama version is an Apple product.</p>
<p>Sticking its tongue out, no less.</p>
<p>Not sure if joking?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s supposed to be Mom&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>It is, but the whole thing was a satire of the iPhone, hence the name eyePhone. The creators were poking fun at some of the more&hellip; enthusiastic iPhone users.</p>
<p>Its Mom&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>To be fair, it does kind of look like an apple with the extra &ldquo;cowlick&rdquo; coming from the upper center of here head and angled like an apple stem. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure <strong>what</strong> that is supposed to be, so I just referred to it as a cowlick.</p>
<p>How does it work if you wear regular glasses?</p>
<p>This line of research is mentioned and discussed in the video.</p>
<p>So much Google as of late.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re just hearing the drums.</p>
<p>Deal with it.</p>
<p>No really,  I can&rsquo;t wait for google i/o</p>
<p>I thought the same thing I&#8217;ve being hearing Google everywhere. Not that its a bad thing.</p>
<p>That shit cray</p>
<p>Mad cray, family</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t it, Jay?</p>
<p>ok glass, what she order?</p>
<p>Fish filet</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with the design is that you have to poke yourself in the side of the head to activate it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what that means</p>
<p>My boss is a boss.</p>
<p>Your boss is a borg.</p>
<p>Resistance is futile.</p>
<p>Eh, to hell with resistance, Google take me into your cypertronic network now!</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone was tempted to stand beside him and say, &ldquo;Ok glass, google naked pictures of LeVar Burton&rdquo; or something along those lines.</p>
<p>The voice equivalent of running up and pushing a random button when someone puts their money in a vending machine and then tries to decide what they want.</p>
<p>I look forward to a future  where is socially acceptable to wear cool electronics while showing chest hair!</p>
<p>I believe he was trying to seduce his way into getting a Glass set.</p>
<p>If people accepted Bluetooth, anything is possible.</p>

<p>there&rsquo;s a <span class="caps">GIF</span> in here somewhere&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why the design is asymmetrical. It would represent a much bigger battery (on the &ldquo;empty right side&rdquo;), and also, would make it less weird. Maybe cost, maybe too heavy&hellip;</p>
<p>Weight and comfort.  That&rsquo;s fairly obvious considering the original prototype weights and designs.</p>
<p>Removable frame.</p>
<p>They could design a symmetrical glass with a removable frame.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be cool if you could switch the display to the left or right side</p>
<p>Am I the only one who would rather have the display on the left side? My right eye seems to be much stronger than my left, and I would rather have that eye be the one that stares out at wherever I am and have my left eye receive the information from the prism. Also, if the proximity of the display causes vision problems (which nobody seems to have asked about, yet), I&rsquo;d much rather my left eye suffer.</p>
<p>I agree, but I guess they might have decided it would look too bulky, like one of those 3D glasses with the thick sides that they hand you at the theater, I&rsquo;d rather have a bigger battery though (generally, I don&rsquo;t know what the glass can do).</p>
<p>But also reading this,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; houses the brains, battery, and counterweight..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to wonder, why is there a counterweight, I mean I can understand that they&rsquo;d need a counterweight for balance, but why not just make it more battery? Why add otherwise nonfunctional heft to a device sitting on your face?</p>
<p>Excellent review, guys.  You gave me goosebumps.</p>
<p>Are there any whispers on Retail pricing yet?</p>
<p>I hear around $1500, which seems sort of ok for v1.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not retailing pricing. That&rsquo;s the pricing while it&rsquo;s not being mass produced and still in beta.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping for ~$500 retail.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s for the developer edition. Surely the actual consumer version will be considerably cheaper.</p>
<p>I dunno, a lot of nerds are willing to pay 1500 for it now.  Hell, I know I am.</p>
<p>Sergey said a while back to a reporter that he wants them to be 300-600 US dollars if possible.  :)</p>
<p>Its gonna be around the price of a smartphone so not to expensive I wanna see what they do with v.2 of this product.</p>
<p>i think i am skeptical about wearable tech because i don&rsquo;t think we as humans want to leave the discrete device paradigm.<br />
there&rsquo;s something a little off putting about having a pair of glasses overlay, in your line of sight, a display. it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">TOO</span> immersive.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be interesting going forward as these types of devices become more normal and mainstream. There&rsquo;s going to be a schism between those people who want to take that &ldquo;augmented&rdquo; leap, and those people who don&rsquo;t. Sort of like Borg vs Humans. ;)</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that no one is going to feel &lsquo;right&rsquo; about constantly looking up and to the left/right?  Even just watching Josh in this video I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about how strange he looked and if I walked by someone on the street looking up and to the side like that I would wonder &ldquo;wtf is wrong with that person?&rdquo;  There&rsquo;s even a little of this in the scene of him walking down the street and a person looks back at him that way.  If I&rsquo;m talking, or &lsquo;engaging,&rsquo; with another human being I want their attention.  I think this thing would bother more than if the person pulled out a phone to look at while talking to me.</p>
<p>But as more people start using it (if this sort of thing does catch on) then it will become more commonplace and people will become used to it and it will all feel natural and not so off-putting.</p>
<p>So we will all just meet and greet each other without looking at each other.  We will all be looking slightly to the upper right.  Really weird.  I gotta say this is just too immersive for me.  I&rsquo;m a big tech gadget nerd but even I don&rsquo;t like to be constantly connected.  As it is now, I can walk down the street or drive in my car and everyone is looking down at their phone.  No one makes eye contact anymore.  It&rsquo;s sad really.</p>
<p>Well you obviously wouldn&rsquo;t be doing those actions all of the time. The current social interactions will (probably) still exist, but this thing will be integrated into that. It should be something complementary not something that totally and completely takes over any sort of interaction.</p>
<p>David,</p>
<p>Every night, during my commute home from work (S.F.), I head down to the <span class="caps">BART</span> Station.  As I get down to the platform, I observe everyone around me and 90% of the crowd are looking down and interacting with their phone.  No one is looking at each other or talking.  Same thing when I get on the train.  When I&rsquo;m at a restaurant observing other diners, be they friends or couples, there is very little human interaction.  Phones are alway in hand either checking email, texting or taking a picture of their food.  So when you say &ldquo;social interactions will (probably) still exist&rdquo; and &ldquo;It should be something complementary not something that totally and completely takes over any sort of interaction&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m not convinced.  We have become addicted to our devices and instant information.  I know I&rsquo;m sounding extreme but I&rsquo;m not exaggerating my experience.</p>
<p>Well yeah, because most of them are probably strangers to each other. And in this day and age you kind of have to be careful about who you&rsquo;re interacting with. Though certainly not every place or area is like that.</p>
<p>Are you then saying Glass isn&rsquo;t solving a problem but rather replacing a problem? At least I am facing you when reading my emails. I suppose you could flip them off your face the same way you can pocket a phone.</p>
<p>If you are facing me and reading your emails, you are not looking at me or paying attention to me.  Yes, flip them off your face.</p>
<p>Its a non sense debate. Like Dave said who wants that awkward small chat with a stranger? I don&#8217;t its stupid and I&#8217;d much rather be texting my friends or emailing or surfing the news. Really who likes that small chat crap. &#8220;Oh the weather sure is cold today&#8221; no shit buddy. I just don&#8217;t understand this argument that looking at your phone is rude instead of engaging with strangers. Its a pointless argument and needs to end. Furthermore I see the glasses actually help people being social because then they won&#8217;t need to check their phone every time it buzzes</p>
<p>&quot; I don&#8217;t think we&quot;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8221;*</p>
<p>Fixed for accuracy.</p>
<p>What I haven&rsquo;t figured out is how it would integrate with actual glasses.  I can&rsquo;t wear contacts, for example.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working with glasses designers, all that will become known as we move through these development phases</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t really help. They need to be working with people who make prescription lenses. Glasses designers just get you pretty frames. I need prescription lenses to see.</p>
<p>Watch the video. They are already developing another reference design for a version with prescription lenses.</p>
<p>The technology to add prescription lenses to frames have existed for a while now.</p>
<p>Can you be specific about what you think is the big problem that needs to be overcome to have Glass exist along with prescription lenses?</p>
<p>Because every prescription is fairly unique it becomes a problem quickly. I still haven&rsquo;t seen prescription 3d glasses. They just tell you to wear them on top of your glasses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible now to get very cheap prescription lenses, but if they are only working with high end glass designers, that&rsquo;s going to add hundreds to the cost of them.</p>
<p>I have a hard time seeing how this should be an insurmountable or even non-trivial problem to overcome. I guess we&rsquo;ll know more once the product is ready for consumers.</p>
<p>The frames bro, they ain&rsquo;t cheap as it is let alone buying a special version that allows you to mount Google Glass.</p>
<p>My concern would be having to buy special frames rather than having it integrate into my existing.  I already have to dish out a couple hundred on frames every few years, so having to buy a limited set of frames just to work with an already (likely) expensive piece of hardware does not do it for me. :)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s little reason the actual glass can&rsquo;t be prescription lenses.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RTFA</span><br /><span class="caps">WTFV</span></p>
<p>That last scene in the video is just chilling. Is this going to be an action movie?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all fun and games until we end up like these guys!<br /><img title="" src="http://www.infinitydish.com/tvblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cybermen-Stuffershack.com_.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s when the fun will get <span class="caps">STARTED</span>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;v come to the conclusion that Planet of the apes is the most racist movie I ever seen in my life. Basically about black people taking over the world. The only smart ape was the white one. C!!!!  It clicked in one night when I was baked out my  ass yo!</p>
<p>lol. king kong is similar.</p>
<p>The drugs &hellip; get off of them.</p>

<p>Yeah, I went there.</p>
<p>I had to google to check that.</p>
<p>Never realized platypuses were so small. so you&rsquo;re actually right! <span class="caps">CATS</span> <span class="caps">ARE</span> <span class="caps">BIGGER</span>!</p>
<p>You checked. Not sure if serious &hellip;</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re climbing out of a burning building. In which case you would either want a ladder or steel-weaved toilet paper.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a Mythbusters episode about that a long time ago?</p>
<p><a href="http://mythbustersresults.com/motorcycle-flip">Found it.</a></p>
<p>Okay so it was a prison escape, not exactly the same thing. I doubt one would waste time twining toilet paper together while a building is burning.</p>
<p>i wish there was an option to see videos also with these glasses&hellip;like google open youtube and select any video and watch it :D</p>
<p>Now you can make it to the end of the 100 hours of Nyancat video.</p>
<p>NO!</p>
<p>Youtube, yea right.  You just want to watch porn in public.</p>
<p>hahaha maybe :P</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for everyone&hellip; everyone with a mobile hotspot.</p>
<p>Still is a cool concept. I&rsquo;m not sure that infrastructure is here yet.</p>
<p>It says in the article that all it requires is a bluetooth connection, same as current hands-free options.</p>
<p>Very nice. Thank you. I blame cold medicine!</p>
<p>I was wondering how the bluetooth data would work with iPhone.  I didn&rsquo;t know that you could send cellular data over an iPhone bluetooth connection, or is this limited to those with &ldquo;tethering&rdquo; plans?</p>
<p>You can. Options are wifi, bluetooth, or usb connectivity.</p>
<p>blue tooth tethering or wifi tethering,  which you can do on any decent phone (after you root it)</p>
<p>I imagine eventually a data-enabled version will be out after this goes on retail.</p>
<p>I could not be more excited for this technology. It&rsquo;s not every day that we get to try out new gear that actually opens up a range of unexplored possibilities.</p>
<p>It was a cool video. I&rsquo;m glad that guy didn&rsquo;t act like a douche, like he did when Google opened their door to him last time (Nexus 4 &amp; 10), and really glad Apple wasn&rsquo;t mentioned at all. Go Google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Apple-level design. No, in some ways it&rsquo;s beyond what Apple has been doing recently. It&rsquo;s daring, inventive, playful, and yet somehow still ultimately simple. The materials feel good in your hand and on your head, solid but surprisingly light. Comfortable. If Google keeps this up, soon we&rsquo;ll be saying things like &ldquo;this is Google-level design.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>how did he act like a douche before?  I&rsquo;m beginning to think your&rsquo;e an Engadget spy.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/0BdR6yh.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Josh, you once again have made me envious of your job and how good you are at it.</p>
<p>Going to the product, Glass is something I am definitely interested in. It&rsquo;s an awesome concept, but depending on its implementation into the current ecosystem, it may or may not work (ie how will it get data?)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s supposed to work with your smartphone. It utilizes the data connection of your smartphone. Communicated with it via bluetooth 4.0 (the most battery efficient version yet). It works like Google Now does in the current jelly bean phones. Of course it&#8217;s much more than Google Now.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this is something that actually exists. When I was a kid I thought I&rsquo;d be able to experience technology like this by the time I retired, not in my 20s.</p>
<p>I love technology.</p>
<p>but not as much as you, you see</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qcpIC8cWhCo/UABJYdgWSTI/AAAAAAAAEaY/q-VNQFyzIao/s1600/zooey.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Glass&hellip; because people with Bluetooth weren&rsquo;t big enough assholes already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>*Glassholes</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s perfect. We had Bluetools, now we&rsquo;re going to have glassholes. Love it!!</p>
<p>Never understood the hate towards people wearing bluetooth&hellip;</p>
<p>it isn&rsquo;t that they are wearing bluetooth headsets. it&rsquo;s that they are wearing it in a bar/club, can&rsquo;t possibly hear anything and just wanna look like douchebags with that blinking blue light reminding everyone how important they are.</p>
<p>When Josh T. said yesterday on the Vergecast that he had something special, I called Google Glass. I have been waiting for this write-up!</p>
<p>Soooo, Google wants everyone to wear glasses?</p>
<p>One more step towards turning the whole world into nerds.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>Wait until they invent the heart rate monitoring pocket protector.</p>
<p>nice pun :)</p>
<p>Being able to Google search anywhere, handfree and on demand sounds very appealing</p>
<p>not sure if you forgot the &ldquo;/s&rdquo; or not&hellip; Letting Google know everything about my personal life through G Glass is downright creepy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m probably in the minority, but i feel that people are becoming too caught-up in this technology / connected / social thing that makes real social life a rarity. I see more and more people at lunches or dinners or bars and clubs spending more time playing with their smartphones than talking to each other. To me this is really sad, and i&rsquo;m not that old at 31 to have an obsolete mindset, at least i hope not.</p>
<p>Did you even read the article?  That&rsquo;s the entire design impetus for this, wanting to bring people /back/ connected to reality.</p>
<p>But it sounds from your tinfoil hat dislike of google that you probably already have preconceived ideas and skipped to the comments.</p>
<p>what does &ldquo;connected to reality&rdquo; even mean? Do i need a display below my eyebrow to be able to live my life &ldquo;connected&rdquo;? You&rsquo;re probably right, i should put this tinfoil hat away, you know me so well</p>
<p>+1 because i am on the mobile app</p>
<p>I read the article. Wanting to bring people back to reality eh? Yes, I too remember the day I saw so many people just pecking away at smartphones&hellip;..</p>
<p>I just set my phone to silent with no vibrate and put it in my pocket.</p>
<p>I guess Im just the kind of person that doesn&rsquo;t need to check subway directions every 2 seconds in a city I&rsquo;ve lived in for a year, doesn&rsquo;t want to watch other peoples first person videos, doesn&rsquo;t need status updates, and doesn&rsquo;t want to record everything.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; these look fun, but they are toys and might be tools for people at work who want to record stuff/live data. But for adventures get a gropro, its HD, cheaper, and doesn&rsquo;t need an internet connection or a cellphone, neither of which come with adventures. If you want to come back to reality and stop having digital distractions, turn your phone off and go outside.</p>
<p> I love tech, but I have no illusions about it. These will be cool, and they look good. But they won&rsquo;t be on my face.</p>
<p>I agree with you pretty much entirely, but I will be getting a pair as soon as they are available.</p>
<p>rtfa</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve read it, but i&rsquo;m not sure this will solve the problem at all. We&rsquo;ll be appearing to look at each other while being focused on something else.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need to be focused on something else. The whole point is to make it blend in so that you&rsquo;ll just get your information faster and get back to what you&rsquo;re doing faster.</p>
<p>It is like a watch, you look at it, get the info you want, and then you are out.</p>
<p>At the moment I own four tablets, two phones, two laptops and two desktops &ndash; all of which are less than two years old. Needless to say, I&rsquo;m connected to the Internet just about anywhere and everywhere I go. I&rsquo;m also platform agnostic so I&rsquo;ve got no particular grudge against Google. I understand their business model and it doesn&rsquo;t bother me one bit.</p>
<p>All that said, I have absolutely no interest in Glass. I suppose I should find it to be both compelling and fascinating but instead it just seems&hellip; intrusive? I&rsquo;m not sure what the right word is. But I just don&rsquo;t see the appeal of being more connected than I already am.</p>
<p>Sounds like you read halting state or rainbows end. Stop projecting and read what they&#8217;re actually planning.</p>
<p>I adore the kind of geeky design. I hope they won&rsquo;t change it. Or offer this design, at least.</p>
<p>$1,500 and it&rsquo;s yours. This exact design.</p>
<p>well it&rsquo;s his if he applies and google excepts him into their program.</p>
<p>Webran61 is talking about the Developers edition.</p>
<p>Exactly. Plus I can&rsquo;t even apply, I don&rsquo;t live in the US.</p>
<p>&ldquo;just this week it extended that opportunity to people from around the world in a Twitter campaign which asks potential users to explain how they would put the new technology to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually that is only open to US residents who can afford the $1500+ taxes and transportation to NY or San Francisco to pick up Google Glass.</p>
<p>Awesome post &amp; video!</p>

<p>Yep. I see the lawsuits now.</p>
<p>It is interesting that cell phones do their best to keep the radios as far away from the brain as possible while Google glass does the opposite.  I certainly don&rsquo;t want to be the first person on my block using this stuff.  I will wait to see how the health aspects work out first.</p>
<p>Bluetooth headsets keep those radios pretty close.</p>
<p>Than it&rsquo;s a good thing glasses doesn&rsquo;t have transmit any radio wave.  Did you even read the article, it uses bluetooth tethering.</p>
<p>They should really delete comments of people that don&rsquo;t read the article. Unless he wants to claim horrible reading comprehension as his defense&hellip;</p>
<p>because bluetooth is not a radio?&hellip;</p>
<p>This looks good, and it could be a great success.</p>
<p>5:25 Wtf ?</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Yeah,  It&rsquo;ll be cool&hellip; But, doesn&rsquo;t Google make a big lump of money by targeting ads?</p>
<p>That would suck if <em><span class="caps">THAT</span></em> was a part of Glass. The idea of having dumbass proximity or trending advertisements popping up during periods of inactivity worries me.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem unrealistic to think that the final product would have that capability.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s likely at all. After all, Google doesn&rsquo;t use their Android and Chromebook products to show you ads (at least not without opening a browser and visiting one of their sites). They only use their consumer devices to help improve their data collection, which allows them to make more money from their web advertising. I doubt Glass will be any different.</p>
<p>YouTube and Maps for Android disagree!</p>
<p>Google doesn&rsquo;t show you ads through Android; only through Google Apps if you have them installed.</p>
<p>They have already said in big letters they won&rsquo;t be advertising with them.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s adds are successful because they are minimal and targeted and rarely /annoying/.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s adds are successful because they are minimal and targeted and rarely /annoying/.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;ads&rdquo; ;-)</p>
<p>Cool!  Now what about third party apps?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was thinking! I just saw this link on the #ifihadglass feed: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE7VP1ObhOs" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE7VP1ObhOs</a></p>
<p>Looks like they already coming out!</p>
<p>When has Google ever attempted this?  Showing you any sorts of ads due to inactivity?  I think Amazon is the only company that does this.</p>
<p>Right, so the Google wants technology out of the way when you don&rsquo;t need it &ndash; so they stuck it to the side of their head?  Nailed it.</p>
<p>I think they worded it wrong. The whole point seems to be to make it so you have instant access to your information and you can refocus on your previous activity in a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p>They did. It&rsquo;s really smart. Ever think you forgot your glasses only to have them on your head?</p>
<p>Yeah. You can ignore a smartphone ring in your pocket if you don&rsquo;t want to be distracted and have a strong will. With glasses you can&rsquo;t even ignore the &hellip;&hellip; notification because it&rsquo;s right in your eye. And they call this a better solution. How stupid&hellip;.</p>
<p>Really?  You can just dismiss the notification, similar to hitting volume on your phone when it&rsquo;s ringing to ignore it.</p>
<p>All I can say is, Glass seems very natural on Josh&rsquo;s face. I have no idea why. It&rsquo;s almost like he&rsquo;s not doing anything weird at all.</p>
<p>Two design flaws as I see it:<br />
1) The device is completely self-contained instead of leveraging a smartphone.  If it had a bluetooth connection to a smartphone it could offload most of the processing, reduce its size, and gain constant 4G access.<br />
2) The voice commands make using the device even more ridiculous than it has to be.  What happened to the eye movement interface?  Seriously, to search for something you have to say &ldquo;ok glass google&rdquo; every time?</p>
<p>Also, it would drastically reduce the price.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you read the article.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, I did miss the part where it can tether for internet.  But my main point is that if the device was built to <span class="caps">ONLY</span> function with a smartphone then it could offload many of the components thus making it smaller and cheaper.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s better for this to be able to function on its own as a standalone device first. &ldquo;Smaller and cheaper&rdquo; will come later like technology always does.</p>
<p>But <span class="caps">EVERYONE</span> is already carrying a smartphone so why not leverage that if it will make the device smaller and cheaper which will improve early adoption.  Having it be self-contained seems like something to do in the future once technology improves, not the other way around.</p>
<p>What difference does it make what end they start from? Glass is a new platform for Google altogether. They are going to &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; it by letting partner OEMs go crazy with it, just like they do with Android and ChromeOS. The Venn diagram of people interested in this and smartphone owners is probably one big circle, yes but not everyone has a Google smartphone, which means they&rsquo;d have to work with Apple, Blackberry and Microsoft before they did anything else (which is out of the question right now, obviously since everyone hates everyone).</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s overstating the situation to say that those companies don&rsquo;t put any work into each other&rsquo;s platforms.  Google has actually put a lot of work into their iOS apps.  But even if it did start out Android only I think that would be an acceptable choice for them because it could be an incentive for people to choose Android.  Unless they come out with a thought-controlled version of Glass I don&rsquo;t see it ever replacing all the things you can do with a smartphone so ignoring the fact that people are already carrying a smartphone seems silly.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re thinking ahead about the future, not so much the present. This is why I trust Google knows what they are doing. I could very much envision Glass having a cellular radio in a version down the line. It already has wi-fi so that would be a logical next step for voice or video conferencing. At that point one wouldn&rsquo;t really need a phone at all. The Glass project is the fundamental groundwork for that kind of future.</p>
<p>Having a cellular radio in your head all day might not be a good idea. Health concerns will be arise.</p>
<p>Article states it works w/ iPhone.  If Blackberry and Microsoft sell enough of their current platform phones, I&rsquo;m sure google will get it working with them as well.</p>
<p>It tethers from an iPhone data connection, yes. I think he was trying to talk about offloading most of the interfacing to the iPhone itself, which wouldn&rsquo;t make much sense to do for Google.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Blackberry and Microsoft and everyone else could get on board as well. Microsoft is currently seeing higher Windows Phone growth than Blackberry is for obvious reasons, so maybe Google will take them seriously soon.</p>
<p>I do believe it&#8217;s compatible with the iPhone as well.</p>
<p>Google Glass, just like Google Maps for Android, really needs offline directions/navigation.</p>
<p>Say hi to 2012</p>
<p>Google Maps for Android has had offline navigation for a long while now;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/06/google-maps-for-android-gets-offline-support/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/06/google-maps-for-android-gets-offline-support/</a></p>
<p>Welp me a dumbass lol. Was thinking offline map download, If you have navigation already started and then you lose data connection is still works. But you can&rsquo;t start Nav w/o a data connection.</p>
<p>Still early morning, so not all cylinders are firing in my head.</p>
<p>Heck yes, at least make the thing navigable via the paired smartphone, rather than asking people to speak to it in pubic. You don&#8217;t need to look down at your smartphone if you&#8217;re just swiping at it to (for example) scroll through an information feed or select a destination for the <span class="caps">GPS</span>.</p>

<p>The device <strong>needs</strong> smartphone to do the heavy lifting and the constant internet connection.<br />
What glasses needs to do is to project the visual trough prism to eye and have own processing to compute the other I/O as well and battery is only for the &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; terminal aka glasses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) The voice commands make using the device even more ridiculous than it has to be. What happened to the eye movement interface? Seriously, to search for something you have to say &ldquo;ok glass google&rdquo; every time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the whole problem with the voice commands, computers can not know when you really meant something to be said to them or someone else like living animals (includes humans) does.</p>
<p>The voice commands are not good to interact with computers. We have dozens of different ways just in English to command lights Off and On, computers needs to know all the commands so it can actually be considered &ldquo;smart&rdquo;. With voice commands the commands needs to be natural, not something what user needs to learn to say, that is good design at all.</p>
<p>The idea that people would use computer fully with just voice is just a bad idea what they have got from Star Trek and other series/movies where computer and voice commands are only used to tell watcher what is happening in futuristic way.</p>
<p>So voice commands can only be used for very very limited way.</p>
<p>And eye movement detection would not work so well as you are on move and you would need to start staring more the prism than where you are going and when something gets your attantion while using it, you would need to start again, very terrible way in many situations so the touch sensitivity is better there.</p>
<p>good god the chest hair</p>
<p>Sexy, isnt it</p>
<p>I was thinking the same thing. Josh is the Christina Hendricks of tech journalists.</p>
<p>Christina Hendricks has chest hair ?!??!</p>
<p>Josh, button up your shirt!</p>
<p>Tech manliness overload</p>
<p>If she did, would you care?  Take your time&hellip;.think about it&hellip;.</p>
<p>yes I would.</p>
<p>God created buttons for a reason.  Please, Josh, use them.  Please.</p>
<p>He is just trolling with that!</p>
<p>Screw everything else I was planning to buy this year: I need these. I actually don&rsquo;t find them that odd looking on someone. Maybe it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;ve been seeing them for a year now, but they don&rsquo;t look &ldquo;alien&rdquo; to me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to have these on my face.</p>
<p>You can have too much information.</p>
<p>And where are the ads?</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any and there won&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve said that more than once.  They are selling this device /for profit/, in addition to using it to integrate with services that do support their advertising business and data collection services.</p>
<p>Great article and video! I&rsquo;m actually really excited for the future of this tech. Wearable computers are pretty exciting and I can&rsquo;t wait to see where this goes.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t this excited when the first iPhone was announced! Holy fuck!! This is just plain awesome!</p>
<p>I could see myself buying this after a couple of iterations when it starts looking like normal glasses.</p>
<p>Google Glasses: They&rsquo;ll put hair on your chest!</p>
<p>can you show the interface? what does the interface on that piece of glass look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the google promo video, also posted with the article.</p>
<p>the interface in the promo video is a rendering, &ldquo;what it could look like&rdquo; and not what it actually looks like. prove me wrong and show me a photo of the google-glass-screen.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t very viable to take a picture of the screen without a camera meant to take pictures at stupidly close ranges. Most cameras cant focus on objects that close</p>
<p>However, the reviewer clearly states that the interface works just like it does in the video. which is much better than trying to describe how it works with words.</p>
<p>They absolutely <span class="caps">NEED</span> to get glasses manufacturers onboard!</p>

<p>almost comparable pricing between Google glass and the chrome book pixel. I think if I could choose I&#8217;d get a pixel &#8211; said no one ever</p>
<p>Uh, isn&rsquo;t that a typo?</p>
<p>is it &ldquo;confident&rdquo; in our design?</p>
<p>it reads &ldquo;Before, we were super excited about it and confidant in our design&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reading through the article, someone should probably be editing the Editor-in-Chief.  Seriously, how many times in the first half of the article does he needlessly switch back and forth between past and present tense?  Once or twice he didn&rsquo;t hyphenate a single-thought adjective.  Awkward sentence structures in quite a few places. And this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my face looks quite right without my glasses on, and I didn&rsquo;t think it looked quite right while wearing Google Glass, but after a while it started to feel less and less not-right. And that&rsquo;s something, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sentence dragged on, for one.  And the last bit (given how many times he said &ldquo;right&rdquo; in the previous sentence) just felt awkward.  &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s got to be something,&rdquo; maybe?  Something without the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; in it.</p>
<p>I find crap like this in Josh&rsquo;s writing all the time, and then go to the comments and read about how awesome and polished the article was.  The subject matter of this piece was fantastic, and Josh&rsquo;s insights are great for the most part, but is there someone who looks over these articles before they&rsquo;re posted that isn&rsquo;t named Josh Topolsky?</p>
<p>This sh*t&rsquo;s <span class="caps">AWESOME</span>, I do need me some of those. If only to scare the neighbors.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no mention of gaming in this piece.  I wonder if Google has any plans to allow augmented reality location games like Ingress on Glass.</p>
<p>That would be up to ingress&rsquo; developers, but I would think it highly likely.</p>
<p>I want to hate on these so bad, but they actually look like a pretty fun product.  I&rsquo;m sure the design will become more minimal as time goes on. I think it really hinges on smoothness and ease of use of the operating system.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m loving the quality of your video&rsquo;s and articles, this really is the best tech site on the web.</p>
<p>If I can get my prescription with the glasses, then I&rsquo;m game.</p>
<p>Buy Google glass for 1500. Walk outside subway for 3 minutes. Someone runs past and jacks your glass.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m getting mine implanted into my cranium.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more afraid of where the battery &ldquo;installs&rdquo; in your idea.</p>
<p>One word: suppositories&hellip;</p>
<p>What I find most interesting about the video, is that almost all of the functionality (basically everything except taking the pictures), would be duplicated by Apple&rsquo;s purported &ldquo;wrist computer.&rdquo;  So even though it&rsquo;s a head mounted pair of glasses, most of what was useful was basically the same as talking to Siri.</p>
<p>Given the upcoming battle between head-mounted and wrist-mounted wearable computing devices, I think the wrist still wins at this point.</p>
<p>However, definitely early days.  The idea that a &ldquo;finished&rdquo; product that&rsquo;s useful and saleable to the average consumer will be available in 2013 is a bit of a boondoggle for that reason.</p>
<p>you didnt read the article&hellip;</p>
<p>Dude, the video is part of the article and I was commenting specifically on the video.  Thus my mention of &ldquo;&hellip; about the video &hellip;&rdquo; in my comment.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to speak for Seven2k7, but I believe what he was getting at is looking at a phone and looking at your wrist basically comes down to the same thing. Which isn&rsquo;t what Google wants you to be doing. So the two concepts are quite a bit different.</p>
<p>I think between a wrist device and a <span class="caps">HUD</span> smart glass, there&rsquo;s not much of a difference in terms of functionality, though I see Glass being more adaptive in certain situations such as, say, live translation.</p>
<p>Glass promotion idea:</p>
<p>Live stream <span class="caps">POV</span> sports games. Imagine the future of live sports games with all players and coaches wearing glass and we watch them streaming on TV/Youtube/Google TV.</p>
<p>Google should partner with some of the sports team to do this. What about making this the main headline feature next year superbowl or <span class="caps">NBA</span> finals?</p>
<p>Google needs to find a way to filter out all the foul languages though.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Never happen.  No professional team is going to allow that in a league game, much less Finals/Superbowl.  If anything, it would be done as a stunt in an exhibition or All-Star game where the outcome doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Live stream <span class="caps">POV</span> sports games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes&hellip; PoV <em><span class="caps">SPORTS</span></em>.</p>
<p>helmet cams are nothing particularly new?</p>
<p>also &ndash; ever tried to take a basketball to face? ever tried to take a basketball to face while wearing glasses? it&rsquo;s not fun!</p>
<p>So excited for Glass. I definitely will buy them. They may look a bit weird now but in a year or two people will be used to it.</p>
<p>the functionality isnt there for anything around 1k&hellip;</p>
<p>kind of like the pixel&hellip;but at least on the pixel you can install another OS and make it a great computer, with this? what can you really do.</p>
<p>its a cool toy and party trick, we need more substance before it becomes a good utility</p>
<p>What exactly are you looking to do with it? It&rsquo;s Google Now + camcorder on your forehead, all voice-activated.</p>
<p>What kind of functionality do you want on glasses? Photoshop? Excel? A bittorrent client? It&rsquo;s not meant to replace any of your other devices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d def take the bittorrent client&hellip;.</p>
<p>Run Photoshop on the glasses and integrate Kinect like functionality into the camera so @Vellion can wave his arms like a crazy person as he edits a photo on his Glass while walking around New York City.</p>
<p>Then it won&rsquo;t be a toy, right Vellion?</p>
<p>How do you come to the conclusion that it will be around 1k?</p>
<p>Dat glass.</p>
<p>I am skeptical if Glass&rsquo;s real life usage right now, but I would be lying if I said I am not truly excited about it, more than Apple&rsquo;s rumored watch device if I may say. It will be an interesting battle to see which one will prove to be more functional and useful.</p>
<p>I kind of agree.  It&rsquo;s like smartphones.  If people want these, others will innovate around them.  Also, am I the only one that thinks a smart watch (from any manufacturer) is silly.  Its a niche product at best</p>
<p>You guys realise that Apple is not actually making a &ldquo;smart watch&rdquo; right?  They are working on a wearable computer just like Google, but it sits on your wrist.</p>
<p>When i say smart watch, &ldquo;wearable computer&rdquo; is what I&rsquo;m thinking</p>
<p>In fact, Apple might even be working on a Glass too. They have patents on &ldquo;Glasses technologies&rdquo; since 2006.<br />
The difference is that Apples never talks about that. But, yes, the watch is way more probable.</p>
<p>A watch feels like a &ldquo;mass market &ndash; right now&rdquo; device while the glasses feels like a &ldquo;mass market &ndash; in a few years&rdquo; device.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. I still think Google design with those glasses is weird and ugly, but&hellip; Joshua says it&rsquo;s comfortable, you actually can see the screen, well, it works.</p>
<p>I think Google might be creating the next iPhone. If Apple don&rsquo;t launch the actual product before them :P</p>
<p>I think google glass is designed to look really nice. Now they just need to work on the lenses to go along with them.</p>
<p>Kinda like &ldquo;smartphones&rdquo; are more like &ldquo;handheld computers&rdquo; nowadays.</p>
<p>#semantics</p>
<p>Good god. It&rsquo;s SO amazing.</p>
<p>The only problem with <span class="caps">NLP</span> devices with commands in English is the poor ability of the device to pick different accents (especially from non-native speakers)&hellip;.there is no doubt that this device will make wonderful wear otherwise!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Google seems to be moving forward with <span class="caps">NLP</span> for the last few years.  First with word transcription with the Android keyboards, and now with Google Now.  You didn&rsquo;t think they were throwing away all that data, did you?</p>
<p>i can totally understand the physical keyboard part&hellip;.but i dont think they have seggregated phonetic data</p>
<p>They have been transcribing my Google Voice voicemails and asking me for feedback for three years, before I even had a smartphone. There&#8217;s another boatload of data your forgot to mention.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CAN</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">WAIT</span>!</p>
<p>No estimates of battery life?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good question.</p>
<p>They said it can last a full day of &#8220;average usage&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for Glass,  if they can get these things out for no more than $500 I will buy it day 1. Also, I&#8217;m curious how third party applications will work on this.</p>
<p>I want this. More potential than an iwatch. Simply for the fact that I could see it blending into life. I could see a point where you might forget there&#8217;s a computer on your head. Other than initially getting some gazes this thing seems to be the future. Also Topolsky has epic chest hair.</p>
<p>So many words for what is really just a miniaturized <span class="caps">HUD</span> linked to Google&rsquo;s back-end, with recording capabilities. Yawn.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know why people aren&rsquo;t tired of having <strong>so many <span class="caps">HUD</span> products on the market right now</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s from teh future</p>
<p>So many haters failing to recognize what could be a pretty big leap forward in personal tech.  Yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many words for what is really just exciting new consumer electronics that has never been done before&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="caps">FTFY</span></p>
<p>You go make one then. Since it&#8217;s so trivial. I&#8217;m sure yours will match this feature for feature. So easy to poo-poo what takes teams of smart people years of hard work. Shame on you.</p>
<p>this will be worse than bluetooth headsets&hellip;</p>
<p>everyone yelling into their devices, yammering about personal stuff no one wants to hear about.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not already doing this?</p>
<p>People will be assholes whether or not they have technology.</p>
<p>sounds like starbucks at 7:30 in the morning</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t you bitching about the people that already do this now?</p>
<p>Great article Josh.  I am so jealous of your job.</p>
<p>How long until the military goes all robocop and weaponizes this?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re joking, right?  The military has been experimenting w/ HUDs for a while now&hellip;</p>
<p>HUDs are sooo 50&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Worth $1500 if every time you wake it up it says &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gonna be one bad mother fucker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now with Jellybean</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>It will be fun with lots of people walking past all saying &ldquo;OK glass&rdquo; and activating your glasses.</p>
<p>Alas, it&rsquo;s not gonna happen, as Google Glass uses bone conduction technology for noise reduction and to capture your voice only.</p>
<p>That was not in the article. Google Employee?</p>
<p>No, just someone who knows how to use Google Search.</p>
<p>You needed to touch the touch sensitive area or watch up slowly first before voice activation is enabled&hellip;.</p>
<p>And we continue along the path of Big Brother watching over us at every step&hellip;seriously&hellip;</p>
<p>Google want this on everyone so they can monitor where you are, what stores you are shopping in&hellip;government will want it for what you can imagine&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m far from a luddite but I don&rsquo;t see anything positive about this&hellip;and it makes you look like a weenie!</p>
<p>Paranoid much?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just using common sense&hellip;.unlike most people here. Google is a <span class="caps">COMPANY</span>. They want to make <span class="caps">MONEY</span>. So how does Google make money? They do it by getting all information on the web so you can find it through Google and they can show you their ads. What better way to get all information online then by getting everybody to wear glasses und record as much as possible.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder how naive mankind is.</p>
<p>You know the fun part: there are a lot of data requests coming from the government. In the future it&rsquo;s even greater for the administration because every detail of your life is on Googles servers and they just need to get a court order to get all this nice information (were you have been, who you met and so on). Of course you have nothing to hide&hellip;..of course&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google is a <span class="caps">COMPANY</span>. They want to make <span class="caps">MONEY</span>. So how does Google make money? They do it by getting all information&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">ZZZZZZZZ</span>&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need your condescension; we know perfectly well how Google makes its money (as if Google haters don&rsquo;t remind us every time their name is passingly mentioned). And guess what? We don&rsquo;t care! I know you like to pretend like showing ads is the most evil act a company could do&hellip;but the rest of us are not afraid of being shown commercials for stuff we&rsquo;re interested on.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a Google-hater just because you&rsquo;re critical. Stop throwing strawmen around.</p>
<p>Not caring about privacy much?</p>
<p>This is  not for me. The ability to record videos and photos without people around me not really knowing about it is too much. I&#8217;m not the type to have one company to integrate as such in my daily way of living, learn from it and grow from it. It&#8217;s getting too personal for me.</p>
<p>There are only a few places in the world where anyone could utter the words &#8220;big brother&#8221; about the government and not sou d like a total asshole.</p>
<p>Smartphones with <span class="caps">GPS</span>, and <span class="caps">NFC</span> and WiFi and Bluetooth already give the same set of information to those interested. Google is working on this because they want to become the &ldquo;now&rdquo; service. Information in a convenient <span class="caps">HUD</span>.  Whichever device controls the gateway to your information, is in many ways the most important OS.</p>
<p>No, not the same set of information. When the camera is not pointed at something your smartphone cannot transmit visual information about its surroundings. This device will do that. Even worse, it will transmit information <em><strong>about those around you without their explicit consent</strong></em> &ndash; people who may not want to have their movements recorded by Google or anyone else. There are privacy issues in play here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the camera is not pointed at something your smartphone cannot transmit visual information about its surroundings. This device will do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you read that this device doesn&rsquo;t record anything unless you tell it to, and that even then it only records 10 seconds of video?</p>
<p>Right, you didn&rsquo;t read at all&hellip;</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you see farther than the tip of your nose? Storage capacity increases exponentially every year. Webcams can be turned on remotely. You do realize that technology is advancing, right? It&rsquo;s the use cases that need to be controlled, because you can&rsquo;t stop technology. Just because you can do something doesn&rsquo;t mean you should.</p>
<p>I smell a pure Google hater! I bet if Apple done it you would be cheering them on, even though they will use the data in the same way, just without being upfront about it! All companies use your info to serve you ads and if you don&#8217;t think so then you&#8217;re a fool. I don&#8217;t care about Google using info on me to serve me ads for things I might be interested in, it&#8217;s better then ads for Viagra or some other nonsense I am not interested in. I also enjoy their free services, if giving up a little bit of info keeps them free then so be it! Google will not be allowed to spy with Glass, don&#8217;t be stupid.</p>
<p>So many haters in here. Just mad because their favourite company is not making them. This is a great piece of tech and should be celebrated, regardless of who makes them.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much fail in your comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>You accuse the commenter above you of being a &ldquo;Google hater&rdquo; simply for having a view other than a favourable one. That is a childish thing to do, and I ask you to stop.</li>
	<li>It&rsquo;s socially unacceptable to go around pointing a camera in people&rsquo;s faces. That&rsquo;s one point against Glass.</li>
	<li>No, all companies does not use your information in the same way.</li>
	<li>You don&rsquo;t care about Google using your info, fine, but I happen to care.</li>
	<li>Sure, I probably would be a bit more fine with Glass if it came from a company who&rsquo;s business model was another. But in the end, I still wouldn&rsquo;t want them no matter what company made them.</li>
	<li>You claim that we should celebrate Glass simply because it&rsquo;s technically impressive, and I fail to see why. Something being technically advanced doesn&rsquo;t make it a good thing overall.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at his comment history, it&#8217;s clear he is a Google hater! Something you failed to do bro. I can point cameras where I want, when I want without taking pictures and video! It&#8217;s not taking pictures and videos 24/7, only when you say so and it has a light to let people know you are filming. If you are unhappy with the way Google operates, don&#8217;t buy Glass! No one is forcing you to! It is a wonderful piece of tech, even if you don&#8217;t see it through your rage. It should be celebrated! I think you are the one who has comment fail! Have a good day, Sir.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, I didn&rsquo;t check his complete comment history before defending him, because I think someone can make both helpful and not so helpful comments. There was no &ldquo;hating&rdquo; in the comment you replied to, and that comment stands on its own.</p>
<p>And sure, theoretically you can point your camera wherever you want and shoot video, but people are going to get pissed. That&rsquo;s why I wrote that it&rsquo;s socially unacceptable. You will probably also get a lot of people asking you to remove the device when speaking to them, and they might consider you disrespectful if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>What makes you sound like a total troll is that you put in stuff like &ldquo;even if you don&rsquo;t see it through your rage&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not even angry about this. I don&rsquo;t get angry about comments on the internet. I just thought your comment was dumb. By the way: &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; is quite subjective.</p>
<p>Edit: C&rsquo;mon, why can&rsquo;t you make argue for or against something on the internet without having some guy/girl call you a &ldquo;hater&rdquo;. I wish we could have some debate without it turning into emotional arguments.</p>
<p>Look, some time ago, when it came out Apple had been storing users&rsquo; locations in an <span class="caps">XML</span> file on their iPhone&rsquo;s local storage, it was a <span class="caps">HUGE</span> deal, resulting in a myriad of class action lawsuits all over the world.</p>
<p>When someone would find out, that Glass takes pictures without the user&rsquo;s consent, and uploads them to a secret server, all hell would break loose. This is not something that could possibly remain a secret.<br />
Cache files can be read<br />
Wireless communication can easily be identified and read by any computer, giving you IP-addresses.<br />
There is no way, that something like this would go unnoticed, and there is no way Google engineers would think otherwise. And why the hell would Google want to do anything like this in the first place? Do you think Sergey Brin is like The Riddler from Batman? Get a grip on reality man. It&rsquo;s a fun toy to take pictures. We&rsquo;ll work the privacy issues out with guarantees and legislation</p>
<p>The OS doesn&rsquo;t matter so much how you get access to your data, only required feature from OS of course is <span class="caps">TCP</span>/IP protocol stack and drivers for network device so you can get internet connection from your application or program.</p>
<p>The graphical user interface has been the most important software in consumer computers for consumers, not the operating system what is lowest level software in whole software system.</p>
<p>saying &#8216;weenie&#8217; makes you look like one</p>
<p>On the open ended scale of total nerdiness this beats bluetooth headsets hands down. Also, I would not like to be seen in the street with this thing.</p>
<p>I am sure you are the very definition of cool.</p>
<p>What are you dork fanboys going to say when someone cracks this and we have a Dark Knight situation where anyone can be tracked at anytime, without even knowing?</p>
<p>Whoops, didn&rsquo;t notice guy2000 right above me :S</p>
<p>Your smartphone is already tracking you.</p>
<p>You mean like with telephones?</p>
<p>My phone can place me.  It, or yours, can&rsquo;t video tape me doing something, without my having a decent idea it is happening.  That I am aware of, yet.</p>
<p>But the security cameras on the cafe can. And the ones on the supermarket. And the ones on the street. And those are much better sources for the govt to look for video of you rather than hoping on the chance that Google might have an off angle recording of your boots&hellip;</p>
<p>If someone could hack into your phone they could record audio, which isn&rsquo;t that different.</p>
<p>well, technically most smartphones could nowadays. hardly any phone has a recording light on the front cam.<br />
you&rsquo;d notice it soon enough by losing battery mighty fast and racking up huge transfers.</p>
<p>and it&rsquo;s technically possible to triangulate your position to a building if you&rsquo;re on good coverage area just if your phone is on(by doing it from the network side, but again it needs good network coverage of the phone being in the area of multiple cells so maybe in <span class="caps">USA</span> you don&rsquo;t have that &ldquo;problem&rdquo;).</p>
<p>so I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s that big of a problem.</p>
<p>Well they can not by default tape you but there are malware <strong>for all software systems</strong> what allows to start video recording or voice recording if wanted. There is a rule in big business meetings in Russia that you need to turn off your phone and take off the battery and leave it to other room, because the malware can spy the meeting without anyone else knowing it than spy.</p>
<p>And with just having your cellphone turn on, carrier knows your location in urban area about 50 feet accuracy, about 200 feet in farmlands and less than 10 feet in cities and mals and other locations where there are dozens of cells available. <br />
Do you quess why cellphones are continually contacted to at least three cell and they use the strongest one for connection?</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t a magic trick to triangulate cellphone position in area what has more than 2 cells&hellip;. The tricky part just is, it is information what carrier gets and in EU carriers are forced by law to store even that information for 6-24 months. Even police use that data to catch people as they can just request teleinformation what cellphones have been on specific area in specific time&hellip;.</p>
<p>hey, I didn&rsquo;t know the glass&rsquo;s creator is babak parviz, a sharif uni grad. iranians represent :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest I thought this would be a huge flop, but I could see this working if they are able to integrate glass into my Warby Parkers. Let&rsquo;s hope chunky glasses stay fashionable for a while so we can Glass integrated.</p>
<p>Who did the mixing on the video? The background music should actually be more subtle, not overbearing, when people are speaking. I dk if it was just me, but I found it annoying, distracting, &amp; made voices sound muffled for the first half of the video.</p>
<p>I thought the tone of the music was entirely wrong too, but maybe that&rsquo;s just me.  It was just sort of dark compared to the topic of the video.</p>
<p>Sorry, BB.</p>
<p>I actually liked the music and didn&rsquo;t find it distracting at all. I think The Verge easily has the best videos of the gadget blogs and this one really reinforced that for me.</p>
<p>I have no issue with the music choice. I think it suited the concept of the video just fine. I have been spoiled by the amazing Verge content &amp; that is why I think I noticed at the beginning that music didn&rsquo;t find the proper balance when people are speaking, like a true documentary does. Plus I also do video work &amp; watch a lot of documentaries.</p>
<p>now if this was embedded in your contact lenses rather than glass it would truly be mind bending&hellip;</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t want to wear contact lenses &ndash; even most people with glasses.</p>
<p>For those who want (and most people with good eyes never tried) it would be great. What&rsquo;s your point?</p>
<p>Minsk, not me. I wear contact lenses and I never ever want to have to wear glasses. I <span class="caps">HATE</span> losing full-field vision when I wear them. There was a period&#8212;maybe 6-8 years&#8212;when I took my contacts out maybe 6 times a year, usually to change pairs.</p>
<p>So awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Google has already thought of this, but the immediate opportunity isn&rsquo;t in sales to normal people. The opportunity is in government and corporate contracts. This technology will eventually find its way into Police visors, car windshields, etc.</p>
<p>I can also see tons of copyright, privacy, and legal issues with these though.</p>
<p>imagine recording your classes with Google Glass. A+ for the whole year.</p>
<p>Imagine wearing them during your exams. That&rsquo;s gonna be an issue in schools.</p>
<p>Imagine teachers seeing a gadget on your face and not assume you&rsquo;re cheating.</p>
<p>I can imagine just a ton of background noise.</p>
<p>Before reading this article, I was just meh on glass.</p>
<p>Now, I must have this.</p>
<p>Going to fail miserably.</p>
<p>That opinion backed by extensive market research, I&rsquo;m sure &hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad there&rsquo;s no video-out on the prototypes.  It&rsquo;d be much more interesting if we could see the interface of it in actual use.</p>
<p>Did you read the article? Josh said it&rsquo;s exactly like the video Google posted.</p>
<p>Of course I read the article, but the video Google posted is a produced video.  I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s demonstrating the same exact thing, I want to see it in actual real-world use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me start by saying that using it is actually nearly identical to what the company showed off in its newest demo video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="caps">RTFA</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">RTF</span> comment you&rsquo;re responding to.</p>
<p>I love this stuff as much as the next guy, but if some more of those sleek, smart people would invest their &ldquo;solve the problem of blabla&rdquo; into making water distillation cheaper, faster, and easier distributable, fewer people would die from basically drinking other people&rsquo;s excrement (= cholera).</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know, sorry. &hellip; &ndash; But even from a gadget lover&rsquo;s standpoint (me), this seems a bit frivolous.</p>
<p>Thanks for sounding a note of sanity.  This truly is the dawning of tech porn, now.</p>
<p>Google is a company, not a non-profit.</p>
<p>Yeah who cares about solving actual problems? Money all the way</p>
<p>Right, we shouldn&rsquo;t try to advance tech at all.  None of that effort ever has a positive effect on anything else.  In fact, we should have skipped going into space.  None of that research ever helped anyone, in fact, it probably killed some kittens somehow.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>This may be frivolous, but so is your complaining. Instead, could you direct me towards any groups that I could offer my time or money towards?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the article yet, will definitely read it on my lunch.. but have to say.. That picture at the top is looking <strong>exceptionally</strong> fresh and crisp. Totally badass.</p>
<p>I don’t see why Google Glass isn’t more like $300. Video glasses are only $150 or so. If Google can make Glass into Wayfarers for only $200 extra with eye tracking and bone conduction audio, I’m in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s because of the cost of miniaturization of the motherboard and battery that this thing is costly now. I&rsquo;m sure once it&rsquo;s a consumer product the price will be reasonable, at least under 1k. Seeing the original prototype compared to the size they got it down to is astounding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not production ready.  So each unit costs a lot to produce in small quantities.  In addition, they are not looking for volume sales yet, so why price the prototype at a level where you&rsquo;d have a massive wait list?</p>
<p>This is one of those products when we first heard about it I thought it was one of those things that would be locked away in Google R&amp;D department and never see the light of day.</p>
<p>&hellip;.now after reading and watching this video, I kinda want it.</p>
<p>It represents Google&rsquo;s corporate culture and how it differs from other companies. We know Apple and Microsoft also work on crazy concepts but they rarely let the public in on development of a proof-of-concept like Google has consistently done.</p>
<p>The CR-48 Chromebooks they just gave away for free&hellip; <br />
The excitement of spotting a self-driving car&hellip;</p>
<p>I think they realize that doing this kind of stuff helps advertise Google as a brand &ldquo;of the future,&rdquo; not afraid to try new things and gauge public interest before final products hit store shelves. They&rsquo;ve made a decent business model out of turning &ldquo;beta&rdquo; into a product itself.</p>
<p>Very good thought. Most companies are too scared of competitors taking their ideas and make a product of their own. Google just knows they are first and propably better than the competition.</p>
<p>Good point&hellip;I just imagined Google Glasses with the "wearable Touchscreen&rsquo; concept Microsoft has shown off.</p>
<p>future man.</p>

<p>Glass on both sides would be awesome.</p>
<p>Glass1 (on the right) shows what you see in the video, while the Glass2 (on the left) allows you to multi-task.</p>
<p>So, for example, I can Google for something while I&rsquo;m in a hangout with someone.</p>
<p>Then you will end up cross eyed in a week!</p>
<p>Of course, it was not implied that you would watch both screens at the same time ;)</p>
<p>i want this now</p>
<p><span class="caps">AMAZING</span>..!<br />
Great Article..!!!</p>
<p>josh is awesome!</p>
<p>Still not buying it.</p>
<p>No one will buy it if you don&rsquo;t. Your sale is very important, please buy it.</p>
<p>With that name, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve got other priorities for your spending dollar.</p>
<p>Me too. I can see how people can be interested in it and respect it. But this is one company integrating way above what I judge acceptable in my life. Like Josh said, there are moments when these glasses can prove to be useful, but not enough too carry around all day for me.</p>
<p>Fantastic article Josh! I&rsquo;m very excited for this and can&rsquo;t wait for all the possibilities google glass can bring. It&rsquo;s an exciting time to be both a lover of gadgets and tech but also a consumer.</p>
<p>Oh and, I wanted to thank Michael Shane for the photography. Love it!</p>
<p>yeah mikey, those are some nice looking pics, BB!</p>
<p>I am super excited that it is compatible with the iPhone. Now I can actually get it. :D</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to watch porn on this thing.</p>
<p>Watch? Don&rsquo;t you mean <strong>make</strong>? I doubt the viewing experience is that great on a 1" screen.</p>
<p>I just hope they put a really good HD camera in it that can make great photos, too.</p>
<p>Google Glass is one of my most anticipated gadgets (and I am really skeptical about Google as a company, so that says a lot). The main problem I see is for people with hearing aids or Cochlear Implants (like myself). The external processor of a cochlear implant are quiet big and take almost every space behind the ear, so it might be difficult to wear hearing aids/external processors and Google Glass simultaneously.<br />
Until now, technology like mobile phones and the Internet were huge helps for the deaf and hearing impaired community. With Google Glass that might change&hellip;</p>
<p>Pretty sure, Google knows about those kinds of things. They have smart people working at their company. The Glasses will get smaller and more compatible with other things people have on their faces and heads.</p>
<p>Google glass might cause technology not to be a help for the hearing impaired?</p>
<p>So can you make calls with this.  There should be some way to integrate Bluetooth to make calls.  And since it can make a video, does it use the current version of Google goggles so you can just look at something and say search current item and it does a search of what it sees.  That would be sweet if you walk into a Best Buy look at a product and be able to price match over the internet.  Then order it on the spot with google wallet and leave the store knowing you got what you wanted cheaper.</p>
<p>It says in the article that it connects to your smartphone via bluetooth for data.</p>
<p>The weirdest part about all of this&hellip; I&rsquo;m wearing that exact same scarf right now.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe how Google lunches it&rsquo;s products. Specially this. <br />
If they took a little from Apple on product secrecy and lunching, I think they would sell more than they will.</p>
<p>They are getting tons of recognition for innovation by approaching it so openly. They are getting tons of free press on the device, and tech discussions about it. They are also a company that iterates rapidly, and are proud to offer improvements, and beta concepts. <br />
Google should be more like Google and Apple should be more like Apple. There is no single way to do things.</p>
<p>A valid point based on facts and cogent reasoning.</p>
<p>This is a better use of my money then that new Chrome Retina Notebook.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t care to be talking to my phone in public and I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;d be any more thrilled walking around saying &ldquo;ok glass.&rdquo; In the end, it&rsquo;s just a stripped down interface tied into your smartphone. I&rsquo;d rather just grab my phone and not bother the people around me talking to my glasses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tied to your smartphone for the internet connection, not for computing.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like how it currently looks, and I don&rsquo;t think that many will, but I want very badly for it to work.</p>
<p>Glass highlights probably the two biggest problems in consumer tech right now: <strong>Battery Size &amp; Capacity</strong> and <strong>Mobile Data Caps</strong>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically the future-y tech we have dreamed about, limited only by battery technology and&hellip;AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see anything here the explains how this will appeal to those of us who don&rsquo;t wear glasses, don&rsquo;t want to wear glasses and of course, don&rsquo;t want to be recorded without knowing it.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to wear glasses, I don&rsquo;t think glasses are for you.</p>
<p>Your objection is a bit like an Amish watching a car commercial and going: &ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t want a car, why isn&rsquo;t this commercial trying to sell cars to me, a person who will never, ever, buy a car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess someone didn&rsquo;t like my cave joke&hellip;</p>
<p>I love it, the design is very innovative, the only thing that worries me is the consequences of using them every day, health, etc.</p>
<p>wow thanks, good article.  Was wondering what you would come up with during yesterday&rsquo;s hangout.</p>
<p>this is awsome, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>Dang Josh, you&rsquo;re pretty handsome without glasses on&hellip; you should consider <span class="caps">LASIK</span>&hellip; I had it done 12 years ago and went from legally blind to 20/20&hellip; easily the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever done for myself&hellip; and I thought I looked weird without my glasses also until I got used to it. Trust me, man, ditching glasses is the way to go (with the exception of Google Glass, of course).</p>
<p>Throws wallet at screen!</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for the Explorer edition to ship!</p>
<p>Hey Josh, it&rsquo;s pretty amazing you got a chance to test Glass, congrats. It would be great if you could do one of those Q&amp;A sessions like you used to do before, it seems like this is one device there will be a ton of questions about.</p>
<p>I find it a bit weird you don&rsquo;t speak much about Hangouts with Glass, but then again I&rsquo;m somewhat disappointed Google didn&rsquo;t comment at all on the possibility of adding cellular connectivity and making this a truly independent device. You have mentioned you think Glass will be mostly good for spontaneous picture and video capture, but do you think this could evolve into a more social device with hangouts and messages? Did you test those features?</p>
<p>Do you think Google have figured out a way to monetize this? It seems unreasonable to have ads on such a small screen so it&rsquo;d probably be expensive as hell with that 1.5K price tag. Hope you find the time to reply to those and thanks for a great article.</p>
<p>It is monetized by contributing to their services model. Google Now is a huge part of Googles future. What they did for search they are doing for your life. If this helps Google Now and Google services become more useful to you then they are doing their job.</p>
<p>True, but this doesn&rsquo;t really answer my question. If it was just about the ecosystem Google would not be selling a head-mounted camera on a shiny frame and a Wi-Fi chip for $1,500, would it? Obviously, if the pricing stays for the final model, it is not just the services model. So I was wondering if someone in the know could chime in with their feelings about whether Google is indeed planning to launch the Glass at its high current price or sell it subsidized as the Nexus 4 for example.</p>
<p>I heard they might have to strip down the consumer version a little bit. They&rsquo;ll probably subsidize some of the price as well.</p>
<p>These are currently being produced in very small volume, so probably much more expensive per unit to produce than when they start moving millions of units.  In addition, they are not pricing them for the mass market, because they are not ready for the mass market.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d fully expect a much lower price.</p>
<p>I love the concept of wearable technology.  And I love the concept of that wearable technology integrating a heads up display.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t like about  this is the design.  Specifically, what I find strange is the asymmetry of Glass.  As a species we are drawn to symmetrical people and objects.</p>
<p>I think the asymmetry also makes it stick out.</p>
<p>On Josh they look full-fledged geeky.  On Isabelle they look amazing.  Just saying&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll echo the comment that it would be great to have two versions of these &ndash; one autonomous version with its own cell chip, and one slimmer &ldquo;shell&rdquo; version that would always need to be tethered but have insane amounts of battery life.</p>
<p>And for formal speeches, will these be acceptable for replacing a teleprompter?  That would be an awesome app (especially if they scrolling text kept up with you via voice recognition).</p>
<p>On Isabelle they do look amazing, but I think that&rsquo;s just Isabelle. She has ginger powers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Josh they look full-fledged geeky. On Isabelle they look amazing. Just saying&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was thinking the same thing, but you beat me to it. I don&rsquo;t think they look geeky on Josh, but since i&rsquo;m studying computer science i&rsquo;ve got to deal with a lot geekier people all the time, so i might be used to it. They look kinda crazy on Steve, because he has crazy eyes. They look cool on Isabelle. Of course that might be Isabelle not the glasses, but still. Could mean it&rsquo;s just a matter of making a version that fits the wearer. Just like regular glasses, a pair might look great on one person and stupid on another.</p>
<p>Imagine scenarios of law enforcement or intelligence agencies getting access to your Google Glass live view or something&hellip;. scary stuff.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very worried about privacy here, but at least one positive might be that the police will always know they are being filmed if you&rsquo;re wearing one.</p>
<p>Imagine people being able to record the actions of law enforcement officials and keep them accountable&hellip;.</p>
<p>A valiant effort, from an industrial designer&rsquo;s perspective. It seems we never learn the lessons of sci-fi though. Star Trek video games, robot dogs, ever more connectivity but more distracting and impersonal tech feeds. I still don&rsquo;t like this in principle.</p>
<p>even the reason for its existence is thin. We are impersonal due to technology but let&rsquo;s make more technology that now physically creates a barrier so that we can be more personal, virtually, but not really.</p>
<p>like, dude, lay off the Chrome Pixel and just talk to ppl and pay attention. i fail to see how technology that separates us more makes us more personal. it just makes us more self involved. notice how josh walks around like a zombie, minus te rotting flesh.</p>
<p>i guess for $1500 we can get that kind of personal as well. they havent made a use case. they haven&rsquo;t even developed its proposition. personally, i&rsquo;m going to lump this in with Chrome Pixel, Q and now Glass as the dumpiest most useless tech of the last few years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i fail to see how technology that separates us more makes us more personal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you don&rsquo;t get it. Once people get used to the functions, it just blends in and you don&rsquo;t even think about it (at least that&rsquo;s the goal).</p>
<p>Not buying it&#8230; Remind me too much of bluetooth earpieces that I see douchebag walking around talking to themselves</p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head!</p>
<p>Like people holding a phone up to their ear and walking around? The only difference is the Bluetooth douchebags have free hands.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one person who can pull off wearing Glass, it&rsquo;s Josh.</p>
<p>I like narrative journalism.</p>
<p>Thanks for a perfect article!</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m ready to pay. It feels like coming from future. I love the &lsquo;idea&rsquo; and invest it.</p>
<p>Great article Josh! It really will be a ground-breaker, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time like you said. As a collector of frames, I&rsquo;d love to see Google partner with Warby Parker or a local designer rather than submitting to the monolith that is Luxottica. It&rsquo;d also keep prices lower I imagine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to stir anything up here bu tat least it looks like Google is trying to do something with their profits compared to Apple apparently hoarding the money and not putting any of it into things like developing competitive web services, fixing the Podcasts app, etc.</p>
<p>Apple is just more secretive with their stuff and doesn&rsquo;t go around hyping products that you can&rsquo;t actually buy or use for many months.</p>
<p>They certainly do leak lots of details to the <span class="caps">WSJ</span> and Bloomberg though for &ldquo;not hyping products that you can&rsquo;t actually buy or use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they leave phones at bars on top of that.</p>
<p>heyooooo</p>
<p>This is one of the best articles I&rsquo;ve ever seen on the Verge.</p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t make you excited for technology, you need to check your pulse.</p>
<p>you have pretty eyes O_o</p>
<p>So on Glass to Glass hangouts you will not see any of the persons wearing glass, just what they are seeing?</p>
<p>I foresee a market for a mirror accessory.</p>
<p>I apologize&hellip;..wait, no I dont. In my opinion, they just look stupid. I cant get by how stupid they look but that&rsquo;s just my opinion. I&rsquo;m a google user/fan all the way but I wouldnt wear them at this point. Its similar to the feeling I get when I see someone walking around with a bluetooth earpiece in their ear. If you&rsquo;re not driving and you&rsquo;re walking around with a blue tooth ear piece in your ear, I&rsquo;m here to tell you what your friends wont&hellip;..you look stupid.</p>
<p>Am sorry, you are the stupid one my friend. And thanks for your contribution, now let those who are more interested in the technology not looks rejoice.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine; just like BT devices, not for everyone, but as long as there&rsquo;s a market&hellip;</p>
<p>is this 3G enabled? for 1500,itbetter have amazons whisper sync cuz im notpaying another monthly fee.</p>
<p>Wifi will connects thou Bluetooth to android or iOS phone for connectivity. Again why 15000$ for the developer kit when the hardware to run this is not high end?</p>
<p>To make sure that only developers who are serious buy it&hellip;</p>
<p>Why would they price it for the mass market when it&rsquo;s not ready yet?  These are still prototypes.</p>
<p>Very impressive I tough this was Vaporware but its coming. I wold love to have this portability and ease of use over looking down to a mobile phone but since it does not have lte and this is all mobile tech(arm processor with jiriscopes and a camera) why 1500$ for the dev kit? I mean the hardware to run this is very basic. Does not need quad core or a tegra chip&hellip;</p>
<p>Aw, man. I was <em>hugely</em> skeptical of this. but now&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah. Now I want one. Dammit.</p>
<p>Amazing device, amazing article. Bravo.</p>
<p>Mind blown</p>
<p>Absolutely blow away by this article! Amazing work!</p>

MachoMan Topolsky</p>
<p>Maybe he should worry about the hair on his chest instead of the hair on his head during The Vergecasts&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, his chest hair is keeping him warm against the elements.</p>
<p>I thought he was wearing a cashmere sweater under his button-down. I stand corrected.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m due for new glasses next month.  This article and video make we want to wait.  GJ, the Verge.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to Josh&rsquo;s secret article and I&rsquo;m glad to say he did not disappoint. Love you guys! I&rsquo;ve been with you since the beginning and I&rsquo;m not going anywhere any time soon.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine the danger of using these while driving. Surprised nobody has mentioned this yet.</p>
<p>Very little I would presume, compared to looking down at your phone or dashboard etc. this would cause less danger since you always have the road in very close proximity to the UI. In fact it may help with driving, see gas, speed etc. in the glass <span class="caps">HUD</span>, etc. no longer need to look away from the road.</p>
<p>The heads up navigation is one of the killer features <span class="caps">IMO</span>.  I&rsquo;d love to drive with these.  I hope Josh tries this out for his next update.</p>
<p>In addition, what is the one place that <span class="caps">NOBODY</span> feels silly wearing a bluetooth headset?  Their car.</p>
<p>you aren&rsquo;t using your hand!it is similar to Bluetooth unit so nope it isn&rsquo;t more dangerous!you are still keeping an eye on the road!</p>
<p>They must be horribly detached from reality to think in the current form, the mass market would ever consider wearing these on their face.  It&rsquo;s geek shit and that&rsquo;s putting it nicely.</p>
<p>I use sun glasses all the time and most people do, wearing glasses is not a barrier <span class="caps">IMHO</span></p>
<p>Project glass has the cool factor of walking around with a Bluetooth headset on your eyes.<br />
That&rsquo;s what will kill this project if they release it in current form.</p>
<p>Delicately stated.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t an attractive woman on the streets of Manhattan not freaked out that some guy is taking her picture with Glass.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised how many would pose for a picture&hellip;</p>
<p>I am really curious about the optical setup.<br />
What is the virtual image distance to the device or the eye ? What is the field of view ? What is the resolution ?</p>
<p>Now <span class="caps">THIS</span> is innovation, <span class="caps">HTC</span>! Can&rsquo;t stand their dumb talk about innovation when all they do is make a better smartphone than their last one.</p>
<p>Looks like Google is the new innovator, and not Apple anymore. I&rsquo;d say there have been three big device innovations in the last few years:<br />
1. The invention and proper execution of the smartphone with the iPhone<br />
2. The invention and proper execution of tablets with the iPad<br />
3. The invention and proper execution of wearable tech with Google glasses</p>
<p>Glass is yet to be something the masses use. I think it is an idea that needs to be tested on the marketplace, yes, but I&rsquo;m not sure it is going to be the standard anytime soon.</p>
<p>exactly. i wanted to type &ldquo;3. The invention and proper execution of wearable tech with Google glasses?&rdquo;, but forgot the questionmark</p>
<p>glass has no apparent use. even its creatirs don have any idea what they are doing with it. this is about as innovative as the pet rock. at least pet rock inventor knew the reason and purpose of is product&hellip; a rock from the beach.</p>
<p>this is not true. if you read the article you could see that there is indeed a real use for it. that&rsquo;s why people get excited about it after all, if it was just a niche product for nerds that had no chance for the mass market, not too many people would get excited about it</p>
<p>Yeah, but the people getting excited about this are not real people&hellip;only ounkeo knows real people&hellip;</p>
<p>i know but these are pure geeks. aparently the Q was touted by geeks to have overwhelming potential. i can see this being useful in industry and a few select cases but not to the general public. it&rsquo;s about as useful as the Q is in reality.</p>
<p>Not really. The Q was never pitched as a mass market device. In fact, a lot of us criticized why the same features couldn&rsquo;t be placed on Google TV.</p>
<p>If they (when they) open this up to developers, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see thousands of possibilities.</p>
<p>also, wearable tech? google invented the wristwatch? even now, the wristwatch has glass beat in terms of purpose of function <span class="caps">AND</span> style.</p>
<p>inventing for me means in this case (as my post tried to point out) also making it work so good and being so useful, that almost every person can take benefit of it, make their lives easier, better, whatever (even if that might just be an illusion that tech makes our lives better)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the wristwatch has glass beat in terms of purpose of function <span class="caps">AND</span> style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/facepalm</p>
<p>you can deny reality all you want. a nice watch beats any wearable tech for style. it also functions and has a purpose. it tells time. google glass? yeah, thought so.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FAIL</span>.</p>
<p>Style changes and shifts as time passes.</p>
<p>Wow&hellip;you really DO think Glass doesn&rsquo;t tell time just as well. Thanks for the laughs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the wristwatch&hellip;was reserved for women and considered more of a passing fad than a serious timepiece. Men, who carried pocket watches, were quoted as saying they would &ldquo;sooner wear a skirt as wear a wristwatch&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Goes on&hellip;</p>

<p>This changed in World War I, when soldiers on the battlefield found pocket watches to be impractical and attached their watches to their wrist by a cupped leather strap.</p>

<p>yes i do. and back then, their definition of style was to wear the same thing as everyone else, smoke pipes and kept women in the kitchen.</p>
<p>they wouldn&rsquo;t know what style was/is. you also realise bluetooth earpieces are still not cool yes? a few really dense ppl do though just like how crocs will never be cool no matter who wears them.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve said previously that the actual product is well designed, it just will never be stylish on a girl or a boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;kept women in the kitchen&rdquo;? What does that have to do with style? Are you trying to infer that because they were sexists, they didn&rsquo;t know anything about style?</p>
<p>I see debating is not your forte.</p>
<p>I see this actually working.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt this is the future, but I can&rsquo;t help but think that a voice-only interface isn&rsquo;t going to cut it as the only way to interact with the device. Even in the age of Siri I can&rsquo;t see it ever being socially acceptable for people to just randomly shout commands to their glasses in line at Starbucks or on a street corner. Not to mention there are plenty of times where you wouldn&rsquo;t even <em>want</em> to. What if you&rsquo;re trying to send a private text to someone? And how many of us have searched for things on Google that we&rsquo;d rather other people didn&rsquo;t see?</p>
<p>One possible way to integrate an alternate interface into the glasses is to fit it with two displays, one for each eye. Using the same principle as how 3D glasses work, a slightly different image could be displayed into each eye (but without the headaches), giving the user the illusion of objects floating in 3D space in front of them. Then the cameras on the glasses could track your arms Kinect-style and allow you to touch and manipulate virtual interface objects in front of you.</p>
<p>Yeah, standing in line at Starbucks waving your arms around randomly is so much more acceptable than speaking&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too far fetched to envision having hand gesture control integrated with the camera.</p>
<p>Google glasses and Oculus rift are made possible by mobile phone hardware, what else is coming because of it?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to try a pair of these out.</p>
<p>Despite the social akwardness, there&rsquo;s plenty of possibilities: take pictures of the meals to control the calories, interact with printed QR <span class="caps">CODES</span> (now they are just useless), take a picture of a book&rsquo;s page, interact with videogames in real time (it would be a really usefull second screen), interact with TV comercials (IF done right), make a &ldquo;video diary&rdquo;, recording parts of each day, see emails and <span class="caps">SMS</span>, interact with showcases, and, of course, the inevitable adult movies recorded with this.</p>

<p>Most ridiculous comment ever</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most ridiculous comment ever</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most ridiculous explanation ever.</p>
<p>I should leave it at that, but that&rsquo;s not me. So please tell me how everyone is going to go crazy over a video camera, which is what the Glass does. Not a special video camera. Not a video camera that&rsquo;s always recording what&rsquo;s happening, allowing you to save back a certain amount of time (my suggest from a day or so ago). But just a video camera. Tell me how that isn&rsquo;t a novelty? Tell me how that beats a smartphone after the novelty has worn off?</p>
<p>Because more often than not by the time you take your smartphone out of your pocket, unlock it, open the camera app, aim, focus, and shoot, the thing you wanted to take a picture of isn&rsquo;t there anymore.  With Glass, the camera is always there and available, ready to shoot photos or videos at a moment&rsquo;s notice.  This is <span class="caps">NOT</span> the feature I&rsquo;m looking most forward to, mind, but it&rsquo;d definitely be a feature that I would like.  I&rsquo;ve practically given up ever trying to catch anything with my phone&rsquo;s camera :\</p>
<p>your username says everything about you</p>
<p>I get chills every time I watch the video. Thanks for this very in-depth article. #ifihadglass!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neat and all, but not truly a game changer.  Once the <span class="caps">HUD</span> functionality can be integrated into contacts?  Then it&rsquo;s on. <br />
There is going to be a pretty big backlash towards these once a few jerkoffs do some inappropriate filming and put it out on the Net.  It will be on the Today Show/<span class="caps">GMA</span> and then some dim Congressman will introduce a bill to require lights and sounds when filming and it will just be a mess.  And imagine all the folks who will end up like that guy in France at the McDonalds with the permanent cam that was assaulted.  I don&rsquo;t see a happy ending here in the near term.</p>
<p>Its impossible for the eye to focus on something that is literally on its surface, try to look at your fingertips next time you put your contact lenses in.</p>
<p>Technically, you don&rsquo;t actually need to focus &ndash; you just need the light to be collimated, the images will form on the retina as if the were superimposed on infinity. That&rsquo;s how HUDs and the Glass work, actually &ndash; you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to focus on the Glass display, either, if it weren&rsquo;t using collimated light.</p>
<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re anywhere near the tech that will make this possible in contacts.</p>
<p>Also, on contacts, you would see blinking on the video it records.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand what you just said but I am fascinated by it.  I wish there was something like a <span class="caps">NOVA</span> special on this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s especially cool since it has everything to do with lasers, and everyone knows lasers make everything better.</p>
<p>Not in the commercial space, but I think I&rsquo;ve read somewhere that <span class="caps">DARPA</span> is making / has made <span class="caps">HUD</span> contacts.  Nothing quite like a military budget to get shit done, I suppose.</p>
<p>That said, I also feel like they decided it wasn&rsquo;t a great idea after all.  It&rsquo;d be terrible to see your platoon leader on his hands and knees looking through the grass looking for his <span class="caps">HUD</span> contact while shits blowing up.  That&rsquo;s why they now have something much more similar to Glass as a command <span class="caps">HUD</span>.</p>
<p>All that comes with new technology. Especially when it helps the common man.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t Josh&#8217;s hair look this good for the verge cast?</p>
<p>Great article. Seems promising but still not convinced on the glass, which looks really cool but I don&rsquo;t want to twist my eyes up while I am talking with someone or viceversa, looks really weird.</p>
<p>Goddamn it. I love you, Verge.</p>
<p>Reddit is polishing up their Upskirt Section as we speak&hellip;just imagine the daily input into that section.</p>
<p>How would a head mounted camera help with this?</p>
<p>Yeah that&rsquo;s a bizarre comment. To use this for that wouldn&rsquo;t you have to stick your head down there? Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a little obvious.</p>
<p>Now, if Nike was making a new pair of shoes called Smart Sneakers. With all of these features but using tactile feedback instead of a screen then it&rsquo;d be good for that section on Reddit.</p>
<p>Someone should tell them there are cameras you can install on your shoes instead of waiting to <strong>wear smart glasses on your feet</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;or maybe we shouldn&rsquo;t tell them.</p>
<p>true the look of the glass thing itself need work.but then this is a beta!i dounbt the final product will look like this!but they needed unit working a year ago to test!and make adjustement!</p>
<p>The Porn industry is going to love these, talk about <span class="caps">POV</span>.</p>
<p>Oculus rift is Porn gold actually, this is just a tiny display with connectivity so your phone stays in your pocket.</p>
<p>I mean more for recording video ;)</p>
<p>Producing not consuming lol! Your right</p>
<p>It is a new height of navel gazing for an already bloated, ethically challenged culture,</p>
<p>Should sell big.</p>
<p>Wonderful write-up, makes me excited on the advent of augmented technologies. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>p.s. as loyal readers can we get some Verge stickers?</p>
<p>Stickers are coming. Patience is required. More to come soon. :)</p>
<p>If the Glass made me look as awesome as Josh does in the first photo then I would buy it in an instant.</p>
<p>Who cares about Rayban or other retail glasses and partnering deals. I like how Google said you just remove a screw and put in your pair of glasses. Just make it universal that what would be a great feature i would want. I wonder if they will make the Google Glass be able to send the pics to your phone or is someone called it would pop up on Google Glass.</p>
<p>Its a bluetooth headset for your eyes.</p>
<p>It does seem like it. I was expecting a cellular radio built-in. Maybe Google isn&rsquo;t too keen on picking and choosing cellular radios at the moment. The Nexus 4 for example is essentially 3G (<span class="caps">LTE</span> in Canada and some T-Mobile).</p>
<p>Price.</p>
<p><span class="caps">POV</span> porn.</p>
<p>It had to be said.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait till this thing is released. Game changer no doubt. It&rsquo;s not much worse than people wearing Bluetooth earpieces.</p>
<p>The only challenge is that its mostly voice controlled. So walking around talking to your glasses, seems a bit worse than when you see people talking with a Bluetooth earpiece in their ears, they are at least talking to another human&hellip; Having people walking around saying &ldquo;hey glass&hellip;&rdquo;, is kind of strange&hellip; maybe over time it will become &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, but me personally I would always be waiting till no one is around or within earshot, to use it.</p>
<p>In love with Verge and Google.</p>
<p>Heck I&rsquo;m so jelly.</p>
<p>i suspected users would stare up a lot like they have downs syndrome.</p>
<p>josh, perhaps you haven&rsquo;t watched ur own video but ere&rsquo;s nothing natural about glass. everytime u wear it, you&rsquo;re staring up into thin air&hellip; in public.</p>
<p>It only takes proper positioning and some getting used to.</p>
<p><a href="http://s161.beta.photobucket.com/user/Celtic_Maiden/media/gifs/harrypotter-snapemybodyisready.gif.html">My Body Is Ready&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I would never wear those glasses.<br />
Embed that technology in my wayfarers and i&rsquo;m sold.</p>
<p>They made glasses for people who don&rsquo;t wear glasses with out modifying them to be glasses for those who need them. Whats up with that? will actually incorporate real frames?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reference design.  The guy said they very much want to work with partners to get these on normal glasses.  Relax.  If there&rsquo;s any sort of demand, frame makers will produce them.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to see these <span class="caps">IRL</span>. I also cannot wait to have the disposable income to be able to pay $1500 for a pair.</p>
<p>But then he wouldn&rsquo;t look like a hipster.</p>
<p>Without his glasses,Josh looks like Sergey Brin. Get contacts Josh, i use them. They are not vain, they&rsquo;re handy!</p>
<p>A watch and  a pendent combo make more practical sense to me for day to day use vs Google Glasses.</p>
<p>It is incredible Google is creating this, that it even exists. For people already wearing glasses it makes perfect sense, would hardly be noticeable with something they need to wear all the time anyways. How about though for the majority of people who don&rsquo;t wear glasses.</p>
<p>In the write up Josh mentioned when it was amazing to use :<br />
- take a photo or video<br />
- call up information<br />
- get google map directions<br />
- get messages</p>
<p>Stuff that all of us do with our phones now, useful stuff. How long do we spend doing these actions? We take a smartphone out, check the info, and put it back into our pockets. So in a 16 hour day whats the actual &lsquo;stare at screen&rsquo; use time. I&rsquo;m going to guess 2 hours, its likely less. That&rsquo;s 12% of the day.</p>
<p>The glasses however in order to be useful are attached to your head all day. There is no &lsquo;put away in your pocket mode&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s laudable Google is trying to stick the entire concept into the Google Glasses, but I wonder if a more piecemeal approach would make more sense. Watch shows information, headphones talk back to you. A necklace or pendant like thing that takes pictures (the headphones can also attach to). This will let you take pictures on command, and give commands which then are processed by the phone and shown on the watch.</p>
<p>Once all the hype wears off a bit, I think what you&rsquo;re saying could be right, for most people at least. Well, most people barely use the functionality of their smartphone anyway.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s some great apps that integrate well with the Glass device, we might look back on these as a turning point.</p>

<p>What about them? If you refuse to wear this, then don&rsquo;t buy it. What&rsquo;s there to do?</p>
<p>looks like a wearable mobilephone. gimmick</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo; about a wearable mobilephone?</p>
<p>Looks neat, but I would be super worried that these would get snatched off my face if  I wore them outside.</p>
<p>bet you could start a video recording of the guy/girl snatching your Glass, and assuming you have it set to automatically upload photos and videos to your cloud you&rsquo;d have great evidence of the crime.  Not sure it would help you get the Glass back in one piece, but you could settle for justice being served, I suppose.</p>
<p>the solution is simple: Make Angry Birds Glass edition. Then people will remember, hey that thing is on angry bird, lol</p>
<p>Thanks, Verge!  This is an excellent piece.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll just get the Oculus Rift and use it outside!</p>
<p>But kidding aside, this article really made me reconsider this thing. Can&rsquo;t wait for it to become normal!</p>
<p>Really love this idea, but I think early adopters are going to have to get used to this:<br /><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/U3oy9tN.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>To be honest, I think she is looking at the camera crew or more &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that guy they&rsquo;re filming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He is <span class="caps">JUST</span>. <span class="caps">THAT</span>. <span class="caps">SEXY</span>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s looking at&hellip;she&rsquo;s the odd one out. Everyone else in shot has Google Glass!</p>
<p>I think it is the way how he keeps jacket closed&hellip;. I would ask &ldquo;What he has to hide?&rdquo; :-D</p>
<p>But why others than teens should know about tech? She might very well be a &ldquo;&uuml;ber geek&rdquo; or even working at Google wondering why Glasses are out&hellip;</p>
<p>People are going to look at you weird when you have a film crew following you around. They also might look at you weird with this product on, but can&#8217;t say form sure if she even noticed.</p>
<p>If you watch the video, it seems she was looking at Josh, but who knows?</p>
<p>He does look a bit like an assassin from the future in that screen cap&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah, especially with him adjusting his coat like that. Just has to locate his target first.</p>
<p>Glass should come with &ldquo;Eagle Vision&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first thing came to mind was he emulated the Watch Dogs guy.</p>
<p>he should&rsquo;ve turned to look @ her and said, &ldquo;<span class="caps">PEW</span>! <span class="caps">PEW</span> <span class="caps">PEW</span> <span class="caps">PEW</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>she thought the Borg invasion had commenced and no one told her, lol</p>
<p>Amazing article !! Now to save $1500 anyway!</p>
<p>Great article. This looks awesome, but I see a backlash against this occurring, especially in Europe where Google has had to take down photos of publicly viewable properties photographed for Street View. I don&rsquo;t think anyone has a right to privacy on public property and I think we should be allowed to film/photograph public officials, police officers, and anyone conducting their work in the public sphere. Maybe I&rsquo;m a little bit of a nut, but if I want to take a picture of random things, people, etc while having a picnic at a public park, I don&rsquo;t think anyone has the right to stop me. Right now, it seems like a lot of people are overreacting to privacy concerns. Of course, I think that within my own home I don&rsquo;t want anyone violating my privacy, and I don&rsquo;t want my financial information stolen/used for nefarious purposes. The question is how far do we protect people&rsquo;s privacy before we are violating other people&rsquo;s liberties?</p>
<p>well, <em>Europe</em> can decline their invitation to the future and instead bask in the glory of the status quo.</p>
<p>A backlash is to be expected with all new technologies. Eventually people find a way to strike a balance an most everyone is happy.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Google had to take down pictures of private property not public property. They also do this in the US but only for the super rich.</p>
<p>Also where is the connection to Glass?</p>
<p>The view of someone&rsquo;s house from the road is not really private though so I personally think parts of Europe overreacted to Street View shots. So while the house is private, taking a picture from the road is not against the laws of the <span class="caps">USA</span>. The connection to Glass is the ability to take video or pictures of people in public without them knowing.  Given the number of public officials being caught breaking the law, I think it&rsquo;s an important right to have.</p>
<p>You always had this right in Europe and mixing this up with Google street view is totally misleading. The issue about pictures of private property in Google street view was not about taking the pictures in itself from public space but about that the pictures were made public world wide for commercial gain without the consent of the owners. Also some rich people (also in the US like for example Dick Cheney) feared to become easy prey for thieves, robbers or terrorists.</p>
<p>Same applies in Europe for pictures of people. In general you can take pictures of people in public without them knowing. In general you cannot take pictures of non public people in private space. In some European countries the definition of this is more narrow than in others. But what is always limited is the right to make these pictures public especially if it is for your own commercial gain without consent.</p>
<p>But there are some exemptions. News media can use them if it is news worthy. Also pictures of so called &ldquo;public people&rdquo; can always be made public. &ldquo;Public people&rdquo; are politicans, religious leaders, sportsmen, actors, TV celebrities, etc.. These people still have privacy rights. You cannot show them naked etc..</p>
<p>As for taking pictures of police men this is something in between. In most European countries it is legal. In some it was changed in connection with counter terrorism acts (I believe at least in the UK). Still in the US it is supposed to be legal but there are lots of cases were police detained people for this. Just google it.</p>
<p>So your fears are unfounded. While there are issues which need to be fixed Google Glass does not change anything of that in one way or the other. Hidden cameras are known since decades anyway.</p>
<p>My fears aren&rsquo;t unfounded. This part is straight-up idiotic:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issue about pictures of private property in Google street view was not about taking the pictures in itself from public space but about that the pictures were made public world wide for commercial gain without the consent of the owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t need consent from the owners of a house to post pictures of a house that is easily visible from the public streets. Who cares if someone uses it commercially? It&rsquo;s not like I deserve compensation from Google just because my house might appear on Street View or from some satellite shot on Maps. And I also disagree with &ldquo;what is always limited is the right to make these pictures public especially if it is for your own commercial gain without consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why take pictures at all if you are not allowed to share them publicly without consent?</p>
<p>I still contend that people are overreacting to concerns of privacy.</p>
<p>Honestly, I completely agree with you there.  We&rsquo;re <span class="caps">ALL</span> getting filmed constantly when we go outside.  A good deal of that is from security cameras and other such hidden devices.  Besides, do people pay that much attention when they see someone taking pictures or shooting video while their out?  You might swerve to not block their shot, but otherwise most people don&rsquo;t really care if they&rsquo;re caught walking by in someone&rsquo;s home movie.  I don&rsquo;t see why having the camera on your face suddenly makes that unacceptable :\</p>
<p>All of the losers and pervs will now use this device to capture the image of every female they see &ndash; &ldquo;Glass, take a picture&rdquo;, &ldquo;Glass, take a picture&rdquo;; &ldquo;Glass, take a video&rdquo;, etc.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look like a very covert way of snapping pictures. At least with this device you can tell if someone is taking pictures of you, because they literally tell you.</p>
<p>Also you will get punched a lot or people will just snap it and run away. So much easier than stealing iPhones.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;d go to jail for assault.  Seriously though, attacking someone with a camera on their face that can film you at a moment&rsquo;s notice and have the footage uploaded automatically to the cloud wouldn&rsquo;t be a smart thing to do.</p>
<p>Will some people still do it?  Probably.  And I&rsquo;ll laugh my ass off at them as their carted off to prison.</p>
<p>(note &ndash; that was &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the general sense, not you specifically :D)</p>
<p>This is so crazy.</p>
<p>video is breaking on google glass, vsync required !</p>
<p>This is pretty awesome stuff, Can&rsquo;t wait to try one.</p>
<p>As a deaf person, i am tremendously excited about the possibility of real-time captioning using something like google glasses&hellip;</p>
<p>I was just thinking that. It&rsquo;d be amazing if they were able to pull that off.</p>
<p>If they can do speech recognition already, surely it&rsquo;s just a matter of someone making the right app?</p>
<p>I&hellip;..but&hellip;&hellip;wow.  My mind was just blown with the most badass use case I have heard yet.</p>
<p>Best article in the Verge&acute;s history.<br />
I want this so much.</p>
<p>I really feel like this is the first truly revolutionary consumer product we have seen since the iPhone. If this works as it seems to work, and the price can come down, I could see this spreading like wild fire across the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll come down in price.  There&rsquo;s no way in hell they expect average consumers to plop down $1500 for an (awesome) augmentation to their cell phone.  Nah, that price is for early adopters to help cover R&amp;D costs.  I would guess these would sell for maybe half of that, ~$700 (still expensive as hell, like a high-end smartphone, but much more doable for the average consumer)</p>
<p>Tesla Model S, Google Glass&hellip;seems like this whole &ldquo;future&rdquo; thing is finally kicking off!</p>
<p>omg, why does everyone looks cock-eyed when they use it? They should call this product Googley eyes.</p>
<p>m&rsquo;soft will as they turn green with envy</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been Scroogled?  Feelin&rsquo; all Googley eyed?  Try <span class="caps">BING</span>!  &hellip;.Please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps because people are still trying to figure out how to use it properly&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the ultimate answer of why I love The Verge so much.<br />
I hope everyone that&rsquo;s interested in tech can read this piece.</p>
<p>dat chest hair</p>
<p>Why are there still no pictures of what the UI actually looks like through glass!</p>
<p>The YouTube video shows it pretty darn well. Josh says that&rsquo;s basically it.</p>
<p>True. I&rsquo;m just curious as to how the resolution + luminosity actually looks in real life. The pixel density, saturation levels too etc.</p>
<p>I know, he shoulda just plugged his retina into the computer via Thunderbolt so he could show you.</p>
<p>Or, y&rsquo;know, just took a picture of the glass from the inside.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a video.  With the kids spinning and ice dancing and Tai translating.  JTops said that it looks just like the video.<br />
&ldquo;Let me start by saying that using it is actually nearly identical to what the company showed off in its newest demo video.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dude, that is awesome. I don&rsquo;t see this overtaking phones quite yet, but maybe sometime in the future, maybe like ten years, maybe less; it will.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WANT</span>!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Why am I getting eye-raped by your chest hair in every one of these pictures?</p>
<p>If Google could figure out a way to add subaudible commands to this thing it would be game over.  They would be the biggest company in the World.  They have to be working on this.</p>
<p>subaudible?  as in whispering?  I guess that&rsquo;d be cool, but I imagine there are a lot of other ways you could interface with Glass other than purely Voice.  I still think adding a capacitive touch-ring (worn on your hand and operated with your thumb) would be one of the best ways to add basic navigation, leaving voice for specific commands and text entry.</p>
<p>If Google plays their <em>cards</em> right then they may have found something that&rsquo;ll be every bit as popular as their search engine. These are amazing and The Verge&rsquo;s video has me wanting to buy them <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> <span class="caps">NOW</span>.</p>
<p>Just think about the possiblies this device contains. for diabetics, or joggers, or anyone wanting health stats. Imagine being able to see your pulse rate, O2 concentration, blood pressure, blood/glucose levels, and scores of other medical information on the fly. It could, in a very real way, detect variations that indicate heart attack, or stroke, or anything else abnormal, <span class="caps">MUCH</span> faster than what we currently possess outside of a health facility.</p>
<p>How could a pair of glasses do that&hellip; a smartwatch on the other hand&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, because the Glass couldn&rsquo;t communicate wirelessly with my insulin pump, blood glucose meter or Fitbit like they already do. Your iWatch though, would easily be able to do that. Because fanboy.</p>
<p>You use an insulin pump and blood glucose meter &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;?  Doesn&rsquo;t Fitbit go around your wrist, like a&hellip; <em>watch</em>?</p>
<p>Well considering I&rsquo;m a diabetic, yes, I do use them on the fly. As in every day. And my fitbit goes in my pocket and I look at the information after it&rsquo;s downloaded either on my computer or phone.</p>
<p>Everyday is not &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo;.  In the context kyle used in his comment, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;continuously in real-time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for the inevitable &ldquo;Shattered Glass&rdquo; face accidents on YouTube.  If you can get most of the same functionaliy from a dorky Bluetooth headset and my phone, why dump it on my face?  I want technology to be less noticeable, not perched over my nose.</p>
<p>May be the future for the McDonalds drive through window order takers though.</p>
<p>Why would there be any &ldquo;face accidents&rdquo;? Unless you&rsquo;re prone to them already, in which case it&rsquo;s nothing caused by Glass.</p>
<p>As for why you would want Glass? Faster input/output of information. If you don&rsquo;t see the value of being more efficient, stick to old tech.</p>
<p>Just remember Star Trek <span class="caps">TNG</span>.  They eventually took Geordi&rsquo;s glasses <span class="caps">OFF</span>.</p>
<p>The future is invisible tech, not one that hangs over your primary sensory organ.</p>
<p>So now we&rsquo;re confined to making technology the way Star Trek presented it?</p>
<p>Remember also how damn useful and technologically advanced Geordi&rsquo;s visor was?  Besides, if I remember right they didn&rsquo;t just take it <span class="caps">OFF</span>, they were able to miniaturize the tech and implant them into his eyes directly.  That&rsquo;s an evolution of the already advanced tech.  They didn&rsquo;t go, &ldquo;wow, Geordi, you look like a <span class="caps">NERD</span>, you should totally take that visor off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just glad nobody tried to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/17/3164008/steve-mann-mcdonalds-assault-eyetap-digital-eye-glass">rip it off his face</a>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see many people using this as a day to day item (at least not in the next 10 years). But from a professional prospective it could be really useful now. Point of view video sharing (hangouts) would solve a lot of real-time troubleshooting problems, esp with high tech items and health care. For example if an engineer is having problems installing a complicated system, just call tech support with google glass and they can see what you see instantly. Or maybe doctors can use this if they are having trouble diagnosing a patient say in LA they can &ldquo;hangout&rdquo;  with a specilist in Europe via google glass and get help.</p>
<p>Amazing tech. I actually see this taking off as a device for ER doctors or <span class="caps">EMS</span> first responders where having your hands free is critical. I assume version 2.0 will allow you to choose which side you want the glass on. I have a friend who is legally blind in his right eye, so this would not work for him.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is awesome.</p>
<p>The future is coming and it looks like Google is the one pushing the boundaries the most. Have to respect their innovation,</p>

<p>The Verge, Your reporting is top-notch. There are only few times I have felt compelled to commend an article. Unsurprisingly its always been at Verge. There is something you guys are seriously doing right.</p>
<p>Techcrunch , who?</p>
<p>I jumped on the Windows Phone bandwagon.  I really like my Lumia 920.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s things like this that makes me regret my decision.  I&rsquo;d love to be an early adopter, but my WP8 device won&rsquo;t let me.  So, I&rsquo;ll have my wife write a thank you note to Microsoft for how much money their unsupported software is saving our family.</p>
<p><strong>weeps</strong></p>
<p>unsupported software? i&rsquo;m guessing you just recently bought the phone because it was only recently released. what kind of support are you expecting? even apple doesn&rsquo;t push out updates that often unless there&rsquo;s a critical bug. android&hellip;well, zero support. you can wait years and never get it.</p>
<p>Altough the concept is really interesting and fresh, I can&rsquo;t help but feel that the Google Glass sounds like a  hardcore gimmick. Remember the Segway? in theory, it was- and still it, a pretty good idea. In reality? people who own a Segway generally considered to be nerds. it&rsquo;s just the way it is. so what would people think about a person who has a futuristic-looking electronic device on their glasses? would they think he&rsquo;s socially-akward? maybe. Only time will tell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This. The technology looks exciting, but the use cases didn&rsquo;t convince me that I would ever consider wearing this. But, once you get developers on board, and let them play with the possibilities, then we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Segways only solved one problem: inability/unwillingness to walk. And even then the money it cost to fix such an insignificant problem was not worth the squeeze. At least Glass solves multiple problems that, although minor on their own, make your mobile experience easier and more natural.</p>
<p>Boy, you look at least neat in the header photo!</p>
<p>It seems like technology is finally reaching a point where it truly feels like we&rsquo;re <em>in</em> the future. As far as people saying that it will end up a niche product like the Segway or something, remember that all it will take is being able to integrate it into normal looking glasses.</p>
<p>Countless times I&rsquo;ve experienced poor drivers endangering me while riding my bicycle, or for that matter driving my car or motorbike. I can&rsquo;t wait to say &ldquo;ok google glass, video record that @$$hole and send to &lsquo;Real Time News, Bad Drivers of the Day Clips&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cant help but think that this will be a hot items for thieves.<br />
They will realize that the product is very expensive which in turn will cause them to want to steal them. Would not want a gun/knife put on me for a pair of these. (I understand they can steal anything you own, but these would be a novelty)</p>
<p>Yet, I do believe I would love to have a pair of these!</p>
<p>So are watches and jewelry.</p>
<p>Thats why I said, they can indeed steal anything you own.</p>
<p>But, for how long have watches and jewelry existed? If you read my comment, I stated that this would be a novelty. Meaning, its new, which makes it more desirable.<br />
And it is not like your shinny new phone that you can put in your pocket and no one will see it. If you are out in the street, you will most likely wear Glass. This in turn, obviously, makes them highly visible and a possible target.</p>
<p>I am just saying, it scares me of what people might try to do in order to get them out of your face and into their thieving hands.</p>
<p>So I guess the answer is to just never buy anything expensive, or if you do buy a computer or smartphone just never take it outside your house and keep iron bars over all doors and windows?</p>
<p>Where do you live? Maybe you should move to somewhere with less crime?</p>
<p>Use common sense. Just as with the iPhone when it was first released, don&rsquo;t use it if you&rsquo;re in a high crime area.</p>
<p>Only thing I noticed that threw me off. Mentioning twitter but omitting Googles own social media website when mentioning the application process for a Google device.</p>
<p>lol i am 40, going on 41, but there are certain moments where i feel like such a kid&hellip;this is one of those moments.  this can&rsquo;t come to market fast enough for me.  i&rsquo;m usually not an early adopter, but i am buying this <span class="caps">DAY</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> (availability permitting, of course).</p>
<p>I love how futuristic they look.  I mean, sure, when only one person wearing them they look odd, but I can definitely see these on many faces in an &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s the goddamn <em>future</em>&rdquo; moment.</p>
<p>That very last clip could be a scene from (<em>80&rsquo;s SciFi action movie</em>). <br />
The Googlers are following closely, waiting for their chance to shove Josh into an ally, beat him, and recover their Glass.</p>
<p>The key to knowing which way to go when you come out of the subway is to note the direction the train is traveling on the platform and then keep track of any turns you make going up to ground level. That way you can relate your heading as you emerge on the street to the train&rsquo;s travel direction and understand your bearing. Something we all did for decades before smart phones and <span class="caps">GPS</span> came along at all.</p>
<p>Google please do yourself a favor and make this exclusive to Android phones!</p>
<p>How on earth would that help a data company? They will want it everywhere if it&rsquo;s to be of any use to them.</p>
<p>They said it would work with iPhone&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m filing the patent right now to ad bio-feedback and use it to change the color on the fly &ndash; indicating mood, inensity of thought, confusion, or interest.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait until we access our subvoices.. This with silent mind commands would be amazing. One thing I&#8217;m curious about, and I&#8217;m asking instead of searching because most verge commenters are awesome.. Anyone know if there&#8217;s been a study where they&#8217;ve implanted a microphone inside the eardrum? I mean I can hear myself talk, so why wouldn&#8217;t a mic in my eardrum do the same thing?</p>
<p>What is a subvoice?</p>
<p>I think these use bone conducting microphones so you don&rsquo;t have to speak loudly. This is basically a better version of what you are suggesting.</p>
<p>Subvocalization. Like when you&#8217;re reading, you hear the words in your head and when you&#8217;re brainstorming you can talk to yourself about the problem. It&#8217;s cool stuff. Also the bone conducting tidbits are for hearing external audio.. Which would go well with Glass because you&#8217;re already tieing up a portion of your site, regular in ear headphones would degrade another one of your senses.</p>
<p>A mic could never pick up you &lsquo;talking to yourself&rsquo; in that way, because its never actually produced as a sound.  You may &ldquo;hear&rdquo; yourself, but that&rsquo;s just your mind talking to itself in a voice it recognizes as yours.  You could theoretically use some sort of headcap and track impulses in the brain that may be able to be translated to words and commands&hellip;&hellip;someday.</p>
<p>I wonder if Google ever thought of the possibility that &ndash; once it becomes common knowledge that this device basically records everything said and done around its wearer &ndash; the wearers become social pariahs? I can definitely see establishments posting &ldquo;No Google Glasses permitted inside&rdquo; signs on their doors.</p>
<p>I think in Japan you cannot disable the electronic camera click or beep sound on phones because of privacy concerns, maybe that will become more common?</p>
<p>First off, the device doesn&rsquo;t record everything all the time &ndash; just as with any camera, you have to activate it.</p>
<p>Second, this isn&rsquo;t an implant, this isn&rsquo;t permanently grafted to your head. If an establishment says &ldquo;No cellphones inside&rdquo;, you check the phone at the door. Same with Glass.</p>
<p>Human eye cannot feel any difference in 720p and 1080p and this resolution makes no sense. Moreover Google Chrome OS is a joke.</p>
<p>Hi, you must be lost.</p>
<p>Weird isn&rsquo;t it. One day a google story with nothing but hate and contempt, the next day nothing but love.</p>
<p>I think that with more adoption Glass will become something normal and anybody would think about it like it&rsquo;s something weird on your face. It&rsquo;s like with headphones, they might have seemed weird at the begining but nowadays nobody cares.</p>
<p>I wonder if these will come with <span class="caps">NFC</span> to pair easily with your phone.</p>
<p>Also, I can&rsquo;t wait to see people banging their head against the till to pay for their groceries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have the cashier scan the barcode on my neck.</p>
<p>Bluetooth makes more sense, and that&rsquo;s what they use.</p>
<p>To begin with, I admire Google for breaking a Chinese Wall of habits and traditions. Glass is something new and extraordinarily different and I am strongly convinced, that sooner or later it will have a strong impact on our lives. Mobile phones and other portable devices maybe become obsolete because of this rachity pair of unusual glasses.</p>
<p>However, there are two things that bug me. First of them was raised by an excellent point Mr Topolsky has made in the post: Google Glass make you self-concious. I believe it is not about other people staring at the wearer with surprise and curiosity in their eyes, but about safety. It&rsquo;s crystal clear that at 1500 dollars, Google Glass won&rsquo;t be a cheap gadget. It will certainly bring attention of thieves and people who&rsquo;d do the user harm just to get it and use it or sell on the black market. And let&rsquo;s be honest, the danger is great as Google Glass is a pair of glasses that&rsquo;s not easy to hide. It just draw attention, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>The second point is sync and pairing the glasses with your mobile phone, which &ndash; at this very moment &ndash; kind of denies the point of existence of Google Glass. In order to receive text messages, calls, use navigation and voice search and especially data connection, there must be another device in your pocket. I know this might and will be fixed in the upcoming generations of Google Glass, but what concerns me at the moment is how will the data synchronisation between devices work? If I take a picture with the glasses, will it be automatically transferred to my phone memory? If not, what is the physical storage of a pair of Google Glass? If there is any, how to copy recorded videos and taken photos to my PC, smartphone or tablet? Does it have a <span class="caps">USB</span> connector? If so, what is its placement on this very thin and generally minimalistic band?</p>
<p>As for the glasses itself, I don&rsquo;t find it ugly. To me, it&rsquo;s beautiful&hellip; of course as any pair of glasses may be.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they will cost $1500 for consumers, that&rsquo;s just to get developers who are serious about it putting their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p>I think the self-consciousness he described in the article is definitely from people&rsquo;s curiosity, as this is a conspicuous device, but nobody really knows it costs 1500$. With time (if it succeeds) people will come to know what it is, and legitimate concerns will be raised about becoming a target for thieves. As with any expensive device, don&rsquo;t use it in a high crime area. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be on your head 24/7.</p>

<p>Lol wtf is that</p>
<p>The best movie you&rsquo;ve never seen.</p>
<p>Clockwork Orange</p>
<p><span class="caps">OMG</span>, &ldquo;the black mirror&rdquo; profecy comes true&hellip;i&rsquo;m seriously scared!!</p>
<p>Whats the background music in the video at the start?</p>
<p>If I had a nickel for everyone that didn&rsquo;t read the article but commented anyways, I could afford a Google Glass for me and 3 friends.</p>
<p>I never expected this! One step closer to the future. Yah it will blend right in and also create problems and social awkwardnesses at one point. And that&rsquo;s how new technology always does. Hope that will sort out in a good manner. More pro-social manner!</p>
<p>i was an initial doubter but that video sold it super well.</p>
<p>They are so cool.</p>
<p>$1500?   that&rsquo;s one expensive unibrow.   |:&ndash;)</p>
<p>The guy from Google looks a bit cross-eyed. I wonder if wearing this Glass device for long periods of time will damage your vision.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LOL</span>! Just like mom used to say&hellip;</p>
<p>Like a lot of consumers I&rsquo;m wondering, how can TouchWiz or Sense improve on this.<br />
BlinkFeed in your face 24/7. <br />
hehheh<br />
 </p>
<p>I wonder what the legality of wearing these will driving. I imagine it will be strict; at least in the UK anyway.</p>
<p>With our government i expect a ban on them im sure theres something already in place.</p>
<p>Why would there be?  It would be much safer to use these while driving than using, say, your smartphone or standalone <span class="caps">GPS</span>.  You&rsquo;re eyes would stay on the road, and your hands would both be free to manipulate the vehicle.  There would be absolutely no reason to restrict the use of such a device.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see anybody bring this up yet, but what happens when the first person wearing Glass dies while driving into a ditch or walking in front of a bus? In many situations these seem awesome, but if you see a message pop up on the screen, how isn&rsquo;t that going to be a huge distraction? My eyes don&rsquo;t leave the road if my iPhone vibrates in my pocket. Can I help myself from looking at the notification if its right there? Seems like a discussion of safety missing.</p>
<p>I know my phone is set to auto-respond to people with text while I&rsquo;m driving (using Tasker), I can&rsquo;t imagine you won&rsquo;t be able to do something similar with these.</p>
<p>You missed a ton of discussions about this very subject right above you.</p>
<p>Cliff&rsquo;s version: This is no more distracting than a billboard on the side of the road, or a <span class="caps">GPS</span> notifying you to take a turn, or using the radio in the car.</p>
<p>This.  If you drive off the road while using Glass, it means you&rsquo;re a terrible driver.  If you walk in front of a bus, it means you&rsquo;re an idiot.  People are often either or both of these things without Glass.  Adding Glass to their faces doesn&rsquo;t really change that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cool and all, but Josh is right &ndash; there is something terribly wrong with the fundamental way on how humans interact with society and technology. No one talks to anyone anymore, everyone is on their smartphones, checking Facebook, etc. Forever alone.</p>
<p>They made it sound like Google Glass is less intrusive because you can be reading your text messages and emails while looking (but really just facing) someone. I don&rsquo;t see how this is any different. At least people know they are being ignored when someone is looking at their cellphone. Am I wrong to think that this product is slightly dishonest in that regard? This is all aside from some very cool tricks these Glasses DO indeed have the ability to do. I don&rsquo;t want to sound like this product isn&rsquo;t in many ways very cool.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly. That bit sounded like PR guff. I doubt it was really what inspired them to make the product.</p>
<p>The whole point is, having instant access to the information you have makes it easier and quicker to get back to your regular life, instead of fiddling with your pocket or your purse to find the phone for that one single notification that may just not be that important, in so breaking the train of activity you had.</p>
<p>Am I the only person who can multitask listening (and even paying attention to) what someone is saying without staring rigidly into their eyes, or even while skimming through a text or looking up information?  I know there&rsquo;s a lot of people that DO ignore others when they&rsquo;re on their smartphones, I just don&rsquo;t understand how or why :\</p>
<p>No one talks to &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; &ndash; like they&rsquo;ve always done because those people are strangers.</p>
<p>Take the example the woman gave about the people waiting for the train and staring at their phones.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be that person&rdquo;, as if they&rsquo;d all be engaged in a conversation with one another otherwise.  More like they&rsquo;d all be awkwardly standing around doing nothing, because that&rsquo;s what people do around strangers.</p>
<p>The only time people strike up conversations with strangers is when they are attracted to them or there is some context for them to be together for a period of time, such as a convention, concert, party, etc.  <em>Shockingly</em>, that still happens despite cellphones.</p>
<p>Even though I agree people prefer to keep to themselves, there&rsquo;s a valid point to staring <span class="caps">DOWN</span> and immersing yourself in a screen pulls your attention away from casual contact that <span class="caps">MIGHT</span> happen if you were standing among strangers looking up and around. However, I don&rsquo;t buy her whole &lsquo;being that person&rsquo; criticism. 1) you will be &ldquo;that&rdquo; person regardless of the device if that&rsquo;s the person you choose to be. And you won&rsquo;t be that person regardless of your device if you choose not to be.<br />
2) The notion that she would wear Glass and be able to still interact with data while appearing to be interacting with the world vs. those who stare down implies a measure of phoniness that people rarely find compelling as a decision-factor. because you still have to ignore your surroundings to focus on a display regardless of how close it is to your senses. It doesn&rsquo;t take much for my own thoughts to pull me into ignoring my surroundings, and those are much closer to my senses than Glass could ever be.</p>
<p>Articles like this are the reason I love The Verge so much,  where else can you get this? It really is superb, great job.</p>
<p>very very cool =)<br />
And yeah, both as user and developer and user i soo want those like now =)<br />
Sadly regarding the as developer side one can only apply if from US right now =(</p>
<p>Pov porn galore!!</p>
<p>Get Oakley onboard for glasses and you have my money, I do truly believe Google are onto something quite incredible with Glass</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t ask for this.</p>

<p><span class="caps">HELL</span> YA, but also, where&rsquo;s the ps4 game?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bully anybody that wears them, ha</p>
<p>What a wonderful specimen of humanity you are.</p>
<p>As long as that person is shorter and physically weaker than you, right?</p>
<p>Define &ldquo;bully&rdquo;.  Would you tease me?  Because I would point and laugh in your fucking face.  Maybe I&rsquo;d start a recording of myself laughing in your face and upload it to YouTube, just to show how very little your opinion means to anyone.  Would you attack me?  Congratulations, I now have first-person video of you committing assault.  Fastest trial ever, enjoy your stay in prison.  Meanwhile I&rsquo;ll continue pointing and laughing in your pathetic face.</p>
<p>Ass.</p>
<p>Honestly theyre nice, but, and i do understand they are first gen type starting products, I kind of figured it would be more than just the little square limited to the top right of your vision. I thought maybe they would be able to create images through out both eyes, like a full <span class="caps">HUD</span> display, and again, its first gen, but hey, theres always the future to come</p>
<p>You figured one tiny one unit above one eye could fill your entire field of vision?</p>
<p>no, but with like glasses, you project more of an image across like a screen, they had i guess a concept video of google glass last year that pretty much does what im saying</p>
<p>This product is a niche as niche gets. I&rsquo;d better good money on that.</p>
<p>Its bad when you see a picture of Sergey Brin wearing them and think, &ldquo;Even that guy looks like a total weirdo and he&rsquo;s a multi-billionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If by &ldquo;weirdo&rdquo; you mean &ldquo;totally awesome&rdquo; and &ldquo;I want to be that guy&rdquo;, then yeah I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>Amazing article! Feels like I should pay someone for reading this&hellip;</p>
<p>Is it just me that worries about getting mugged or run over whilst wearing these? A watch might be a better idea for google</p>
<p>They should have an advanced criminal detection system built-in. That would be some sweet future tech. But then cops would wear them, and nobody thinks cops are cool.</p>
<p>Meh. Here&rsquo;s the real deal:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/en/rheinmetall_defence/public_relations/news/latest_news/details_3072.php" target="_blank">http://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/en/rheinmetall_defence/public_relations/news/latest_news/details_3072.php</a></p>
<p>I wrote an article about how it works in your eyes. It&rsquo;s german but if you see the images you will get it anyway :-) <a href="http://www.brille-kaufen.org/google-brille/google-brille-technik-funktionsweise.php" target="_blank">http://www.brille-kaufen.org/google-brille/google-brille-technik-funktionsweise.php</a></p>
<p>Pay to the order of Mr. Joshua Toplosky One dollar and <span class="caps">NINE</span> <span class="caps">CENTS</span>!</p>
<p><img title="Jerk" src="http://www.jimbonics.com/images/jerk.jpg" alt="Jerk" /></p>
<p>Yes! I can&rsquo;t believe more people aren&rsquo;t afraid of this. That looks like major eye strain.</p>
<p><a href="http://pics.imcdb.org/0is685/jerkjaguaretype7.2319.jpg" target="_blank">http://pics.imcdb.org/0is685/jerkjaguaretype7.2319.jpg</a></p>
<p>Why would glancing up and to the right cause eye strain?  you realize you don&rsquo;t have to refocus your eyes to see the display right?  the lens collimates the light projected from the display so that it focuses on your retina at infinity.</p>
<p>The real misuse is when people are going to use this while driving, or in social settings when non-tech time is required. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with being a geek. But being a lonely geek because you can&rsquo;t take these things off, that&rsquo;s bad. But you know it&rsquo;s going to happen.</p>
<p>My primary use case for this&hellip;.would be for driving.  Instead of screwing around w/ my smartphone for <span class="caps">GPS</span> nav, responding to <span class="caps">SMS</span>, calls, etc., I would <em>love</em> to know that I can keep my eyes on the road, and hands on the wheel at all times.  I&rsquo;m a road warrior, so the benefit of this is huge to me.  For those who just do their daily short commute, maybe not such a big deal.</p>
<p>Over time, people will learn to use these in a socially acceptable manner. Of course, there will always be jerks who don&rsquo;t care about anything socially acceptable.</p>
<p>You mean one of the <span class="caps">BEST</span> uses is while driving, right?  So you can keep both hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road while still being able to see your turn-by-turn <span class="caps">GPS</span>, music controls, and notifications without pulling your attention away from the road?</p>
<p>The year is 2013. I am reading the web news on my tablet about the latest in electronic eyewear.</p>
<p>I am not convinced.  I don&rsquo;t think people really want to wear battery powered glasses all day, and I think that the people that do (and talk to their glasses) will register higher on the D-bag meter than the people with Bluetooth sets in their ear.</p>
<p>In other news. I really don&rsquo;t think people will want to carry battery powered music players with speakers on their ears all day long. They&rsquo;ll really look like Dbags doing it.</p>
<p>If you are trying to talk to a person and they keep their earbuds in, then yes, they do.  Additionally, a &ldquo;battery powered music player&rdquo; is analogous to a cellphone in the same way that a bluetooth headset is analogous to google glasses.  So no, comparing carrying around a <span class="caps">PMP</span> is not comparable to wearing google glasses.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re wireless earphones for your eyes.</p>
<p>Where does it say you have to wear these all day? Right now you&rsquo;re just making up excuses.</p>
<p>your video player is a giant piece of butt.</p>
<p>SO <span class="caps">COOL</span>. It&#8217;ll take a while, but stuff like this <span class="caps">WILL</span> be mainstream and some point in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>As a nurse informaticist working in medical devices my head is spinning on the potential applications in Medicine and Healthcare!  Reduced infections in the Operating Room!  Comparison of previous X-rays or endoscopic photos while they perform the operation!  Integration with medical devices!  A nurse looking at your abnormal <span class="caps">EKG</span> rhythm and seeing the alarm when they aren&rsquo;t in your room!  Increasing patient safety while providing more efficient (and less expensive) care!  I can&rsquo;t wait to be part of a project using the new technology!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Good luck, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in surgery when you compare xrays on such a tiny screen&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a high resolution screen. What matters is the field of vision it occupies, not the actual size of the screen itself.</p>
<p>she is hot</p>
<p>So has Google done any studies on the effects of constantly looking up and to the right? Most people when looking at something use a combination of neck/head turning with slight eye movements. Looking at the last picture it seems that it is quite a distance to look at the Glass display&hellip;which I imagine isn&rsquo;t great for your eyes to be doing multiple times per hour&hellip;all the time.</p>
<p>But this still looks cool, it has a ways to go in terms of functionality though before I will wear them &ndash; for example: a much improved Google Goggles that will give me information on what I am looking at..whether it be something in a store or a landmark outside. Combining location+visual data should be able to give very accurate results for an augmented reality display for Goggles.</p>
<p>There are no ill effects from doing a motion repeatedly. Just like there are no ill effects from using your right foot to brake and accelerate a car. The human body is perfectly adaptable.</p>
<p>Cool. Could be a huge game changer. But doesn&rsquo;t this kind of exacerbate the problem the Google people said they were trying to solve? :/</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. This keeps people much more in the moment w/ other people, but still gets them their digital-connection-fix.  As it is now, w/ a smartphone, you pretty much have to completely dis-connect from the world around you to interact with your computing device.  It&rsquo;s a very cold, dis-engaged action.</p>
<p>Meh. It&rsquo;s just as little a disconnect to glance at a smartphone lock screen for any notifications as it is to focus on the glass notification. But you can at least ignore the phone, you can&rsquo;t ignore the glass pop-up.</p>
<p>To truly perform some sort of task on either is a choice and requires shifting your focus to that device. The only difference with glass and a smartphone is you don&rsquo;t need to look down at the thing in your hands, which at least sends the message you&rsquo;ve momentarily disconnected &ndash; a signifier you don&rsquo;t get with glass.</p>
<p>Also, bear in mind that smartphones can be a social connector too &ndash; you can show people stuff on your screen. Glass envelops you entirely in your own world.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t commentary on the quality of the device, just that particular angle Google&rsquo;s PR is taking with it.</p>
<p>have you seen ppl wearing this and using it? they basically roll their eyes and have that glassy stare. this will <span class="caps">NOT</span>  keep ppl in the moment. that&rsquo;s like saying listing to death metal with both my earbuds in while someone is talking to me engages us both to be closer. no. it doesnt. that&rsquo;s what is called willful ignorance at worse and wishful thinking at best.</p>
<p>The shots you see are of people <span class="caps">TESTING</span> the device; of course they&rsquo;re gonna be paying attention to it rather than anything else. They&rsquo;re going through all the features. They&rsquo;re not passively waiting for a notification, or waiting for a moment to take pictures as you would in a normal scenario.</p>
<p>Pretty awesome all the way through&hellip;</p>
<p>Wow, still can&rsquo;t believe Google is pulling this off. Am so excited knowing that in 2013 I will be able to have a computer on my eyes&hellip; Who cares about how it looks ?am not a chick or a hipsters, I just love technology and will not pass on real innovation because of that. I bought the first iPhone when most did not even understand it, and am sure most will not understand what is about to happen soon.</p>
<p>Someone was trying too hard to look sexy in this article.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with guys not wearing an undershirt under their dress shirts?!?!  Come on Josh!!!</p>
<p>Geeks don&rsquo;t care if they look dumb.</p>
<p>Mature self-confident adults don&rsquo;t care what complete strangers think in passing.</p>
<p>Wow! <br />
     I&#8217;m an Apple head but I can&#8217;t wait to see this in the wild.</p>
<p>This is real journalism. Thank you for this excellent piece.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get all this &ldquo;why would i want to wear these in public?&rdquo; in the article. I don&rsquo;t think they look odd. Actually they look pretty cool. That Steve guy might not be the best representative, because he has crazy eyes and makes Glass look nerdy, but they look normal on Josh and fashionable on Isabelle. I&rsquo;d really want them, if there weren&rsquo;t a ton of other problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>They need to be able to attach to all types of glasses. I don&rsquo;t care if they are working on version that accepts prescription lenses. Just go to a local optometrist. There are hundreds of frames to choose from. People who need prescription lenses are not going to start all wearing the same glasses.</li>
	<li>I get that voice control is kinda the only viable option, but if everyone starts walking around talking to their glasses i&rsquo;ll be going insane.</li>
	<li>Obviously the option to record people without them even noticing is creepy. Even more creepy is talking to someone wearing glasses without being able to tell if the person is recording you.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the biggest question is, are people using Glass really going to be less distracted than people using a smartphone? Yes, the interface is right in front of you, but you&rsquo;re still not actually paying attention to the stuff that&rsquo;s going on behind / around the interface. Yes, you have faster access to your mobile computing device and are going to be done with whatever you want it do faster, but you&rsquo;re also even more likely to use it instead of paying attention, just because you can. It&rsquo;s really going to be interesting to find out how people will use these things.</p>
<p>Good points made. I think I lot more people would be interested in Glass if it was an add-on to normal glasses rather than a completely new pair. And I never thought about the fact that people could be recording without others noticing. Longer battery life would be nice as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps a good solution to the privacy issue would be to have a small blinking light while recording, and one blink for a picture. Something that isn&rsquo;t overwhelming, but enough to let someone know if you&rsquo;re invading their privacy.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s the best solution. Just like a phone that records a conversation is required to beep from time to time to tell the other person about the recording. At least here in Germany that&rsquo;s what phones do. Although i&rsquo;m not sure if smartphones still do that.</p>
<p>I wish modern smartphones did that, I got stealth recorded once and was rather annoyed.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t get why they don&rsquo;t make it project directly into your eye.</p>
<p>Because that would be a constant  distraction, which is what they&rsquo;re trying to prevent.</p>
<p>Apache helicopter pilots use systems like that and they seem to handle it pretty well.  The <span class="caps">HUD</span> on my games never distracts me, I only look at it when I care to.  Not to mention you could set a transparency level to the image and make it almost invisible.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Well, it has to be refracted through the lens and reflected into your eye in order to collimate the light so you can focus on it.  If they just had the display shinning directly into your eye, you&rsquo;d never be able to see it (you can&rsquo;t focus that close to your eye).</p>
<p>Even if I only ever used Glass while driving, it would be worth it to me.</p>
<p>In fact, that would probably be 95% of the time that I would use Glass.</p>
<p>I want the frames to be able to change color, rather than have to keep switching them out.  That would be very cool</p>
<p>The blue and orange are nice, but they really need a nice lime green. That would be perfect. Whelp, got a year to save up =)</p>
<p>Watched the &ldquo;How it feels&rdquo; video while listening to Pink Floyd &ldquo;Wish You Were Here&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hey Google, I see a huge ad campaign with that song.  It works perfectly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hear it :-)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfUkFLfHSsE">Run like hell</a></p>
<p>OK Glass: show me places to buy Google Glass.</p>
<p>Solution looking for a problem.</p>
<p>Glorified, miniaturized helmet cam with a bluetooth earpiece.  It&rsquo;ll be great for jumping off building for dumb PR stunts.</p>
<p><strong><em>OK, you want to google something suddenly but your hands are occupied or dirty.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Your friend calls, but your phone is on silent mode, so you miss it.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You need to send an important message, but you&rsquo;re trying to catch the bus. Do you stop to write it? Or do you run? Or attempt to do both and hope you don&rsquo;t run into someone/something?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You want to take a shot or a video of something interesting or funny, but by the time you pull out your phone, it&rsquo;s gone.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>You want to communicate with a foreign language person, but you&rsquo;re not an expert speaker.</em></strong></p>
<p>Plenty of people face at least one of those often. Still think it&rsquo;s a solution without a problem?</p>
<p>Yes, but with a barrage of <strong>ads</strong>.</p>
<p>You think Google gets to where they are by making stupid decisions? Google won&rsquo;t sell a product and annoy people with ads.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.  Glass has no ads, they&rsquo;ve already said as much (besides there really isn&rsquo;t any space on the display to have an ad, unless that were the only thing it was showing you (which it wouldn&rsquo;t be).  You may have 3rd parties with ads in their apps, like we do now with Smartphones, but the Glass OS itself wouldn&rsquo;t be showing you ads.</p>
<p>Okay, this is awesome.</p>
<p>The only thing I&rsquo;m wondering is wouldn&rsquo;t it get kind of annoying to have that in your face all the time??</p>
<p>Alright Josh, you&rsquo;ve sold me on it.</p>
<p>Who want&rsquo;s to guess the first city to ban these devices in certain placed.  Like while <span class="caps">DRIVING</span>!!</p>
<p>I think we are still a ways away from being comfortable with 100% speech control of a computer, and the computer being comfortable with us&hellip;.</p>
<p>Computers will never be 100% controlled by speech, because it&rsquo;s completely stupid.  The future is eye tracking and congnitive recognition (see the recent article about the chimp controlling a robot).</p>
<p>Ask yourself how would you rather interact with your computer: talk back and forth with it, or just look at something on the screen and activate it with your mind?</p>
<p>Miami. I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s a more impressive collection of idiots anywhere in the US (or the world for that matter)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited for this but the price is going to keep it from really going into the mainstream, I think. $1500 is not cheap and the day glass starts selling in the $400-$800 it will be everywhere.</p>
<p>Right now it&rsquo;s far more expensive because buying it is getting exclusive access to a product that people would kill to get and that won&rsquo;t be out for a while. By the time it&rsquo;s in stores it&rsquo;s likely to be far more affordable.</p>
<p>The benefit of user perspective camera (hands free) with built ability to have text overlay.. there are definite use case..</p>
<p>1. Investigation of a a problem such as the famous issues of a cable guy trying to work on the outside box, where the guy is always calling back to &ldquo;headquarters&rdquo; about where they are suppose to connect too.</p>
<p>2. A medical procedure(s) being done with a remote connection  (such as showing the wound or what not ) to others..</p>
<p>3. <span class="caps">PORN</span> &mdash; the whole <span class="caps">POV</span> of view now is well can be insane&hellip; Not only mention of two &ldquo;non-porN&rdquo; people are both wearing the Glass and see what the other is seeing..</p>
<p>Killer app for mechanics or repairmen.  Tech manuals on demand and if the problem isn&rsquo;t covered in the book, snap an image and send it to a tech assist center for further help.</p>
<p>Man, you mention taking video of you ordering at Starbucks and stuff, yet you don&rsquo;t show it in your video? In fact, you show less than 5 seconds of video taken with google glass?</p>
<p>They told him not to take video at Starbucks. He did it to prove a point, not to show the footage.</p>
<p>i cant wait to buy my pair!! im saving my money!!</p>
<p>This makes people&rsquo;s eyes look weird.</p>
<p>Christ, imagine the potential for advertising revenue. This is a device that could passively scan for QR codes (or similar) and deliver contextual visual overlays to everyday street ads, shop fronts, tv commercials and posters.</p>
<p>Fantastic piece guys. Love the amount of work you folks at the Verge bring to pieces like these.</p>
<p>I would like to see a photochromic sunglasses attachment by Serengeti. Wonder if polarization would mess up the <span class="caps">HUD</span>?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d buy a Glass if they came in a prescription blend.</p>
<p>I imagine a standard clip design to attach the Glass part.  You buy frames that are &ldquo;Ready For Glass&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Josh, your other eye, the one w/o the &lsquo;glass&rsquo; in front of it looks lonely trying to stare at something it&rsquo;ll never see.</p>
<p>Lonely? I bet that one is checking Isabelle out.</p>
<p>only if she&rsquo;s floating, lol</p>

<p>Great article Josh.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not totally opposed to the concept. But, there are a few things I don&rsquo;t like about it. They look pretty bulky, for one thing. And, stylistically&hellip; they&rsquo;re going to need a lot more variety. Time and the ever-increasing miniaturization of tech would solve both of those issues.</p>
<p>But, what I find particularly off-putting is the interface. It seems to rely rather heavily on verbal input. I was expecting some sleek eye-tracking or something, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be there. For that reason, I don&rsquo;t see this catching on to the extent they&rsquo;d like it to, for the same reason you don&rsquo;t see people talking to Siri walking down the street or on the train. It&rsquo;s weird. No one wants to be the guy talking commands into his phone. For Siri and the like, I think it&rsquo;s acceptable. I don&rsquo;t feel weird about using Siri when I&rsquo;m home alone. It works when it isn&rsquo;t weird, and I have other options when it is. But, for a product that&rsquo;s literally designed to sit on your head and do stuff whenever you have a whim of any sort&hellip; it needs a more subtle input method. The touchpad on the side could work for simple stuff. But, if you&rsquo;re supposed to be Googling things with it&hellip; I&rsquo;m guessing that would fall short. To me, until an actual neural connection is possible (ie. think &ldquo;Google __________&rdquo;, instead of saying it), it doesn&rsquo;t seem too appealing to me.</p>
<p>Of course, that depends entirely on how it&rsquo;s going to be used. As a simpler <span class="caps">HUD</span>&hellip; an extension of my phone that shows notifications, the time, or whatever information I want on it, you really don&rsquo;t need much of an interface. The touchpad on the side could be sufficient for that. And, really, if they can take that functionality, and cram it completely seamlessly into a pair of tortoise-shell wayfarer Raybans or something, I&rsquo;m totally on board.</p>
<p>If I remember right, Google got a patent for eye-tracking in conjunction with Glass, so its something I&rsquo;m certain they&rsquo;re working on.  Probably won&rsquo;t see it til the Gen 2 or 3 devices though.  A few other interesting input methods could be used in conjunction with voice too, such as a simple capacitive ring on one finger that acts like a simple navigation scroll wheel when you run your thumb along it.</p>
<p>If they could get it to track emotions, control could be even more natural.</p>
<p>It could then be set to record only your happiest moments, automatically. Call for police attention whenever you feel frightened. Select music or movies that you&#8217;ll respond to best at that particular time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call for police attention whenever you feel frightened.</p>

<p>Better not watch horror movies while wearing Glass then.</p>
<p>What I am really curious about is battery life? How good is it?</p>
<p>oh and the number of cleavage videos are going to increase exponentially!!!</p>
<p>This is incredibly exciting. Our world is transforming at a startling rate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll check back in a year&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read some of your comments and I have to say &hellip; <span class="caps">WTF</span> is wrong with you people!</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t any of you nerds get the huge privacy problems this is going to create. It&rsquo;s so typical of Google which is filled with engineers, but doesn&rsquo;t have anyone with any common sense.</p>
<p>How do you think &ldquo;real&rdquo; people are going to feel about you walking into their houses, change rooms, along the street when they know you might (or might not) be recording them. Even little practical things like people who mightn&rsquo;t want to be photographed where they are doing what they are doing . I imagine some of you are going to get your fancy google glasses ripped of your childish heads and rammed up your stupid arse when some people work out what your wearing.</p>
<p>Then there are all the cultural sensitivities about capturing people&rsquo;s images &hellip; obviously no one has really thought about this.</p>
<p>And of course you can get really paranoid and point out that if you think Google knows all about you now, wait until you start wearing this. Also I can see blackmail scams, Government and police warrants &hellip; the list of potential problems is just massive.</p>
<p>Enjoy your toys children.</p>
<p>These will most likely end up causing so many more problems with events, movies and travel too. They will be illegal to wear driving, banned from cinemas (and now they will have to check your glasses), banned from concerts and the list goes on.</p>
<p>I hope the only people using these are the extreme sports types. Watching skateboarding, parkour, etc would be pretty cool.</p>
<p>Oh, we will enjoy our toys. You go ahead and do your best spreading the same faux outrage that followed the creation of smartphones equipped with cameras. The rest of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; people will go on not caring much in the same way.</p>
<p>Do you seriously think most <strong>sane</strong> people will attack a total stranger out on the street because he <strong>thinks</strong> he might be recording him in public? I think that&rsquo;s more of a reflection of your own internal issues than those of the majority, in which case I totally welcome your attempt to rip it off my face so we can ask the judge what he thinks about assault and your self bestowed public space privacy. Try to do some research on &ldquo;street photography&rdquo;&hellip;you&rsquo;ll see how little people really care that a stranger is taking pictures of them in public. In short, stop acting like you know &ldquo;real&rdquo; people.</p>
<p>Enjoy your life, old man.</p>
<p>Google aside, i can&rsquo;t get over how rockstar this picture is. It looks like a backstage shot of the 2033 equivalent to 1976 David Bowie. Or what Prince would look like if he&rsquo;d acknowledge the existence of the internet.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Mr. Topolsky, the audience is now ready.&rdquo;</em> &ndash; <em>&ldquo;No. I tell them when they are ready.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m SO ready to throw my cash at google to get my hands on a pair of these! I&rsquo;m so serious though..</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buy it when it gets to the point that they don&rsquo;t cost more than a smartphone and when they&rsquo;re just a little bulkier than regular glasses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bet $10 that these won&rsquo;t cost more than $700-800 once they&rsquo;re finally ready for commercial release.  $1500 is for early access.  Most average consumers wouldn&rsquo;t drop that kind of money on a phone accessory though, no matter how cool.</p>
<p>Bulk is going to be a problem though.  Don&rsquo;t see any way to get rid of the glass block over your eye unless they can find a better way to collimate the light from the display without refracting it through a lens.</p>
<p>My take is GG definitely crosses the &lsquo;creepy line&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I doubt consumers will want a product that looks like a security/spying device, the basic problem is you can never totally get rid of the camera/display.</p>
<p>Hint, the camera and display need to go somewhere other than the face&hellip;..</p>
<p>Google has mountains of money so they can afford to do research and reuse the technology elsewhere. In would be a good PR exercise for Google to provide GG to first responders for free and in the longer term GG is a good product for the security industry.</p>
<p>PS Another good spin-off is Josh now looks like he is being Styled professionally!</p>
<p>People hardly know what Glass is, much less what it does. By the time they understand it&rsquo;s functions (beyond recording), they&rsquo;ll see it as a personal assistant, rather than a spy cam.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going to be creepier is seeing people still doing the antiquated holding a tiny useless device up to their face and typing up the use of an arm/hand.</p>
<p>I really am not impressed by glass thus far&hellip;a fancy camera that looks like a fashion statement&hellip;How is this useful? Connect this  with biometric data and now we have something</p>
<p>Glass does so much more than just recording; did you not read?</p>
<p>Do you think Eric Schmitt is sitting depressed in his office, sending bitter gmails to Sergy Brin .&ldquo;You get raving praise heaped on your stuff, but they laugh and mock my project.  So unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google Glass&rsquo;s success will be entirely dependent on its voice recognition capabilities. I don&rsquo;t know about you guys, but the VR success ratio on my android phone, in a quiet room, is not so good.</p>
<p>Jizz in pants&hellip;. now commencing!</p>
<p>You should go see a urologist and get that checked out.</p>
<p> &#8220;but this might not be that great at a dinner party, or on a date, or watching a movie. In fact, it could make those situations very awkward, or at the least, change them in ways you might not like.&#8221; &#8211; its kinda like wearing a bluetooth headset in the same situations&#8230;very awkward and most people would remove them.</p>
<p>Apart from me not really seeing a use for that, since I carry two devices with me anyway:</p>
<p>People just look dorky with those things. They&rsquo;re not glasses that somehow project on the inner side of the glass, there&rsquo;s a dongle hanging in front of your face and it makes you look utterly stupid.</p>
<p>What makes one look even more stupid is actually looking at the display hanging an inch over your eye. Look at the last picture with Josh. He looks crazy there. Reminds me of Gajus Baltar. ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ready for them to have apps on Google Glass like Facebook and twitter. Then I can just check my feed anywhere. There are so many cool apps that would be awesome to have incorporated hands free!</p>
<p>This one has already been posted to the #ifihadglass feed! People move quick!</p>

<p>But the feature everyone is going to go crazy with is Glass&rsquo; ability to take photos and video with a &ldquo;you are there&rdquo; view</p>

<p><span class="caps">IOW</span>, it&rsquo;s really just helmet cam for perverts.</p>
<p>Your life must be sadly boring if all you can think of is taking pictures of females&hellip;</p>
<p>Me and my fellow left-eyed pirates spit on this technology that we will never be able to use. Arrrgh.</p>
<p>I find this useless right now, it contains a little piece of glass with a camera, Blue Tooth, and WiFi connection. The closer the screen to your eyes, the worse your eyesight gets. It loses connection when outside WiFi range, and touching the arms of the glasses is just useless. Might as well take out your phone if your going through that much trouble. If the glasses slip off a little, you don&rsquo;t see anything. I don&rsquo;t see the point of a midget screen right now, they should implement a larger glass area with some sort of projection.</p>

<p>And you know this how?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The closer the screen to your eyes, the worse your eyesight gets.&rdquo;<br />
Which is why the light from the display is refracted through a lens first, collimating the image so that it focuses on your retina at infinity. You&rsquo;re eyes do <span class="caps">NOT</span> have to focus on the display in order to see it.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;midget&rdquo; screen is, as you just pointed out, right in your face.  It doesn&rsquo;t need to be very large physically in order to take up a useful chunk of your <span class="caps">FOV</span>.</p>
<p>This hands on talks about the privacy concerns and then this &ldquo;As soon as we got inside however, the employees at Starbucks asked us to stop filming. Sure, no problem. But I kept the Glass&rsquo; video recorder going, all the way through my order and getting my coffee.&rdquo; I think that says it all, people think its ok to see if we can get away recording people without their knowledge even after being asked not to. Shops like starbucks and pretty much every other shop, mall, public building will have to ban the use of these inside their building otherwise it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before it goes to far.</p>
<p>Which will make sense up until you can no longer obviously see the camera. It&rsquo;s easy to argue that publicly accessible places like shops and government buildings are public places and thus you could be recorded at any time.</p>
<p>Same thing always happens when a new form factor is introduced. People can still record videos inside Starbucks with their smartphones, so why would they ban this gadget?</p>
<p>In a Starbucks you usually have a bunch of douche bags on video chat sessions so you&rsquo;re already being recorded numerous times over.</p>
<p>Love this post.. Love this website..</p>
<p>Look past the dirt of this site (Big 3 forums) and then you see amazing content. Keep it up!</p>
<p>Reading this post gave me chills. The Verge team is hands down the best. No other organization compares. Google Glass&hellip; is interesting. It&rsquo;s one of those products that sparks curiosity amongst the masses. I work in Palo Alto and seen someone wearing Google Glass, and I had tons of questions. The first one was to try it on, denied. But the vision of Google Glass is promising: Allowing people to live in the moment with technology, which is crazy to think about. Everyone could keep there phones on silent to accomplish the vision, but the world is changing. And Google understands that. And I&rsquo;m excited for the future of Google Glass.</p>
<p>If you put a second camera on this thing, you could have much easier distance measurement and could have all sorts of info overlaid on the &ldquo;screen&rdquo;. That would be really cool.</p>
<p>Do that and you could also start getting Kinect/new PS-Eye type 3D tracking of people and objects, which could lead to some very interesting applications.</p>
<p>Thank you for this article, Josh. While some articles on The Verge aren&rsquo;t good, the majority are and this is one of them. It&rsquo;s these sort of exclusive features that can set this site apart from others. Genuine info, not just trying to generate clicks.</p>
<p>Again, thanks Josh.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think this technology will be terribly misused. In addition, won&rsquo;t it make humans even more oblivious? When all the information in the world is right there all the time, what&rsquo;s the point of going to school? On that note, it would seem that people who write this information may be lost in the process, since everyone is just reading what others have written.</p>
<p>I hope it&rsquo;s better than that though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty hard to find technology that CAN&rsquo;T be misused.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s what people said when the internet was available to the public.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m fairly sure i&rsquo;ll buy one&hellip;</p>
<p>I just really want them to look like this..</p>

<p>These &ldquo;glasses&rdquo; are very interesting.  I doubt I will buy a pair at the current price.  Off topic.  Do Josh&rsquo;s shirt buttons undo themselves on their own?</p>
<p>Black Mirror S01E03. I live in the constant fear of that episode coming true. And it will to a certain extent with Glass. I just hope it&rsquo;s perfected to a manner shown in the series well after my time.</p>
<p>Wait, I thought Joshua kinda confirmed he ordered one Explorer last I/O, and he even tried Stark&rsquo;s (sorry, Sergey&rsquo;s) unit. Am I listening to the wrong vergecast?</p>
<p>Are you seeing this Apple? Why would anyone want a watch?</p>
<p>Oh, Apple is seeing this. And they&rsquo;re already equating it to the ridicule Palm users got in the 90s. &ldquo;Who wants something nerdy like that, writing emails in the presence of other people is so rude, if I was out with somebody and they pulled out tneir virginphone to compose an email i&rsquo;d knock it out of their hands and leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So theyre working on a watch now, wait for people to say &ldquo;hey it would be great if Apple released iWatch glasses!&rdquo; and then release dumbed-down smart glasses with a note that the things it can&rsquo;t do are things nobody should want to do (which they said, in the case of the original iphone, about copy&amp;paste, <span class="caps">MMS</span>, front-facing cameras, 3G connectivity, installing third-party apps and other dumb stuff).</p>
<p>Then the iGlasses will be a revolutionary product because suddenly &ldquo;real people&rdquo; will want to wear things on their head &ndash; after all, weve been wearing glasses for centuries, but these are smart!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making that first picture my wallpaper on my new macbook lol.</p>
<p>i love articles like this</p>
<p>Wow, that pair of glasses makes Joshua look just as sharp as Sergey Brin!</p>
<p>Glass over the black sunglasses looked super badass.</p>
<p>I could live without the Topolsky unbuttoned shirt shot &ndash; especially since it&rsquo;s been 30 degrees in Manhattan this week.</p>
<p>Looks like Borg Collective gear</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s flawed as a product. You keep mentioning in the review that this is all about giving a more &lsquo;human experience&rsquo; &ndash; I don&rsquo;t see that at all. You give the example of attending a child&rsquo;s sporting event and being distracted by technology &ndash; surely that would only get worse if I start getting text messages and emails popping up in the corner of my vision. We already have a way to switch off &ndash; put the device away.</p>
<p>If you want a device that helps you remove technology from your life whenever you don&rsquo;t want it, it&rsquo;s best to have it all contained in a unit like a phone. A constant overlay is a constant reminder of your connected-ness.</p>
<p>That said, nobody would disagree that it&rsquo;s a cool bundle of technology.</p>
<p>Killer app is going to be photos and videos (of course, since it&rsquo;s a sight-oriented device). The thing is, I think pretty much all the other uses are weak &ndash; the demo of the guy speeding through <span class="caps">NYC</span> traffic on his bike, constantly distracted by the turn-by-turn in his vision is exactly what I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want. It feels weird to say this, but just judging the concept I think it could be over-reaching.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too modal still &ndash; something more augmented reality-like over the whole picture would be better for things like turn-by-turn.</p>
<p>Happy to be proven wrong though. Of course everyone&rsquo;s going to be trying this out and forming their own opinions of it.</p>
<p>Well, the purpose of the device is not specifically to remove technology from your life (that doesn&rsquo;t make sense). The point is to make your connectivity blend in to your life so that it&rsquo;s not as jarring when you have to break what you&rsquo;re doing to interact with technology. Dismissing an incoming message with natural language would be much faster than doing it directly on the phone&rsquo;s screen.</p>
<p>I was so impressed with this article and site that I created an account.  I haven&rsquo;t done that in a decade.  Well done.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is just the beginning of something amazing. Can you imagine in time, (I&rsquo;m a glasses and contacts wearer) being able to implement this type of technology seamlessly within the lens itself. I commend Google for leading the way in a totally new and innovative direction.</p>
<p>A. I hope it will work but bluetooth audio headsets. I ride a motorcycle and a heads display of my speed would be a great thing o have as well as directions. <br />
B. I would wear it now.<br />
C. put an IR camera on it. Night vision baby,</p>
<p>C. ah damn, hadn&rsquo;t even thought about that!  but man, then I&rsquo;d want to put a whole row of different kinds of cameras and sensors along the edge so I can see all the things, with every vision</p>
<p>nokia samsung, etc, needs to rip off this shit and bam clip on version, ( with earphones)  use your glasses ( mines look better)  and plug it on your cellphone. i dont need this silly mess otherwise.</p>
<p>It is just not right publishing this on a Friday.</p>
<p>Hmm, could be something awesome&hellip; but it looks kinda strange. Think I&rsquo;ll jump on board when its a contact lens.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still ways off from that.</p>
<p>Hot damn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we screwed up human experience where we need to say, &lsquo;Let me put on these robot sunglasses?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though still awesome.</p>
<p>This seems like the potential to be something really cool. Unfortunately, do we really need more technology distracting us and augmenting us?</p>
<p>I swear, all of this technology is working towards creating future generations of idiots. I have a hard enough time these days understanding how a group of friends can go out, chat and catch up for a while and within an hour everyone has their heads down in their phones again; or pulling out their phone to &ldquo;augment&rdquo; their conversations since they are no longer interesting enough or can hold attention long enough to be a real person on their own.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting ridiculous. I poke fun at my significant other all the time for these sort of distractions; and annoys me to no end how often she has to reach for her iDevice and endlessly scroll Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Perez&hellip;. give it 40 minutes and she&rsquo;ll be at it again. It&rsquo;s not just an issue for her in specific either&hellip;. so many others. You have actual conversations, and thoughtful communication, laughter etc. less and less often the more people become engrossed in this stuff. The problem is&hellip; these products really are amazing, but they are creating a land-slide of boring, shallow people in a lot of cases with no interest but reading garbage and thinking other people are having way more fun based on carefully crafted pictures, and digital social bullshit. I agree completely with the writers comments about screwing up the human experience. Can&rsquo;t we just pay attention and be &ldquo;there&rdquo; instead of looking through a lens all the time and trying to share and save it for later?</p>
<p>Not to mention&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never had a single issue with finding my way driving wherever I need to go. A quick glance of a map, write myself a couple directions or make a few mental notes and off you go&hellip; rarely need a map ever, but more and more commonly people are lost without a <span class="caps">GPS</span> telling them where to go every step of the way. It&rsquo;s kind of sad honesty.</p>
<p>So where can I buy one, where and how much? lol&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but this year&rsquo;s innovation award goes to Google, hands down.. unless Apple figures out something with their &lsquo;iWatch&rsquo;.. I&rsquo;m hedging my bets on Google.</p>
<p>A: This is a completely amazing, wonderfully designed, written and produced article + video.</p>
<p>B: I am probably more excited about Google Glass than anything else ever in my life.</p>
<p>C: I don&rsquo;t think they should be designing it around trying to reduce our addiction to our smartphones. That&rsquo;s too narrow of a focus. Don&rsquo;t replace or augment my phone, create something completely new. That said, I think they will end up doing it, but maybe not as quickly or well as if that was their focus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am probably more excited about Google Glass than anything else ever in my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! You may need to rethink how you are living.</p>
<p>I just want to see them add some lenses to the thing. It looks strange without a lens; whether dark or clear.</p>
<p>I wonder if it could be compatible with instagram, facebook, and a lot of other social networking sites.</p>
<p>If they could do that then I would buy this in a heartbeat. If not, I might wait it out for perhaps a later model. Overall though, it&rsquo;s awesome and ,due to the fact that I have been following Project Glass for about a year, I am really anxious to see it</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect Google to do any favors to Facebook. Because Facebook is certainly not doing any to Google.</p>
<p>No, but supporting Facebook in Glass would be Google doing themselves a favor, as I&rsquo;m sure a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of people would want that feature.</p>
<p>Please Google make a version for runner&rsquo;s. I would love to have a <span class="caps">HUD</span> with my run information on it.</p>
<p>Want apple contact lenses from Cupertino!!</p>
<p>Josh just become the king of tech nerdism. They sure picked the right guy to sell these puppies, as he pulls the look off like a boss.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forget about normal eyeglasses for a moment. Forget about chunky hipster glasses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, that&rsquo;s you&hellip;</p>
<p>Will it fit inside a motorcycle helmet? My normal glasses just barely do.</p>
<p>I think in a very short time, this thing will look like stylized sunglasses. No need to have them always on but with the short video capability, when you are outside at the amusement park or where ever, this has the potential to being the capturer of so many precious memories. Definitely more for the active, outdoors, social type than the couch potato.</p>
<p>Most amusement parks don&rsquo;t allow glasses on the rides.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s more of a precautionary suggestion. I&rsquo;ve seen people get on rides with glasses and caps on.</p>
<p>I like the fact that Joshua is opened to other than apple technologies. Keep so and I wont think you are a fanboy anymore. Good video and sound!</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page, I&rsquo;m seeing a Warby Parker ad from Google&rsquo;s Adchoice. Coincidence?</p>
<p>you guys make the greatest videos.</p>
<p>I see Seiko 5 military on nato strap</p>
<p>I will buy this when someone makes realtime <span class="caps">ADBLOCKER</span> for it.</p>
<p>This is the future. No doubt about that. iPhone 8? No thx&hellip;</p>
<p>I see another man hand in future porn.</p>
<p>Yes. Indeed. Live porn. Upskirt videos.  Pervs everywhere will rejoice .</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a flexible imagination. How the hell do you make an upskirt video from a head mounted camera without dropping to the floor and/or lifting women&rsquo;s skirts?</p>
<p>Well, looks like they&rsquo;re missing a huge sector of the market &ndash; the approx 65% of the adult population (of the US, but I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ll release first) that wear eye correction, about 64% of whom exclusively wear glasses.</p>
<p>And the others (  like myself ) that had laser eye surgery so we would not have to wear eye glasses. But who knows.  Maybe &ldquo;<strong>nerd</strong>&rdquo; will become a fashion trend.</p>
<p>Just laughed reading this. Laughed from the fact that this is going to be available this year! Holy crap this is cool.</p>
<p>I want them&hellip;  These are Cyberpunk wet dreams come true ;)</p>
<p>This is the kind of product Steve Jobs would overlook personally with a whip&hellip; Even though I am an Apple &ldquo;fanboy&rdquo;, I seriously doubt we will ever see anything as cool by Apple ever &ndash; just iPad / iPhone iterations&hellip; Tim Cook and his &ldquo;Commitee&rdquo; are not those likely to boldy go where no company has gone before&hellip; :/</p>
<p>And I believe that Samsung has already started photocopiers in order to design something new and original: The S &ndash; GlaSS, because the more &ldquo;S&rdquo;, the more original!!! :D</p>
<p>after watching this I thought as humans we are totally fucked now and there is no looking back. But In a very surreal way I think we all are looking for that. It what we all live for nothing is shocking and nothing is sacred.</p>
<p>My problem with it is mostly just the limited input methods. There is no way in hell I&rsquo;m going to be walking around talking to myself to control this thing, the same reason I avoided Bluetooth headset douchebaggery. OK there&rsquo;s a single button but that&rsquo;s very limited and kind of defeats the whole &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; purpose anyway.</p>
<p>Other than that, I love the technology, there are certainly some very cool things that can be done. I just don&rsquo;t like how it&rsquo;s controlled.</p>
<p>Nice but what was the third Dark Mirror episode, the first season? It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before this becomes an implant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is a great article and all, but damn that red head is hot</p>
<p>This looks mind blowingly awesome. Every time I see Glass I want it more..<br />
Two concerns though:<br />
1) How do you keep them from falling off while you&#8217;re skydiving/rock climbing/planet hopping/ whatever you do in your spare time?<br />
2) It would really suck if your $1500 facial peripheral got stolen or broken.</p>
<p>In the video, the Google woman says the main module is easily detachable from the frame, so you should be able to pop it onto other custom third party frames, for example integrated into a headband or hat that holds it more snugly onto your head.</p>
<p>Soon these will be available for a lesser price. Not that it feels good to lose anything to theft or damage, but at least it&rsquo;s easier to take. And once the novelty wears off, you won&rsquo;t need to worry as much about having it stolen.</p>
<p>awesome article again ! I am so excited in what the future will hold. Lets hope google creates an ecosystem where developers have the freedom with glass as with Android.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been a fan of Joshua&rsquo;s reviews, but this article is just absolutely breathtaking.  The humanization of an esoteric and obtuse tech just totally connected me to the goals of the product.  Nice job, The Verge!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to the shuttle stop and I saw a line of not 10 people but 15 people standing in a row like this," she puts her head down and mimics someone poking at a smartphone. "I don&rsquo;t want to do that, you know? I don&rsquo;t want to be that person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok. But I don&rsquo;t see how Google Glass solves that &ldquo;problem&rdquo;.  It may make it less noticeable but information addicted people will just be looking at the glass screen instead.</p>
<p>At least with this solution you can keep your surroundings in perspective instead of focusing solely on the phone screen.</p>
<p>Creeps, perverts and pedophiles just got a little boner while reading this article.</p>
<p>Two, maybe three things will probably kill Glass.</p>
<p>The first is battery life, which can&#8217;t be great. (Did they mention that at all Joshua? What does battery life look like?)</p>
<p>The second is the inevitable sorting of information. Nobody wants to spend half an hour every evening to sort through the dozens of pictures and hours of video they took during the day.</p>
<p>The third wildcard is legislative action. It&#8217;ll just take a couple of big &#8220;creep shots in kids bathroom&#8221; stories to make towns and private businesses to enact rules against persistently recording devices (what use is Glass if you can&#8217;t use it in the mall?)</p>
<p>Not saying that it won&#8217;t have its uses. It might very well be a popular accessory for skydivers or skaters. But we won&#8217;t see Googles wet dream of a billions of video and information streams 24/7 come true.</p>
<p>Creepy people currently cant take pictures because smartphones dont have cameras and its very obvious that when you have your phone out, youre taking a picture.</p>
<p>First, battery life is great (all day from what I heard). Second, it&rsquo;s no different than what people already do when they take videos and pics with a phone. Third, this isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;persistently recording device&rdquo;. Read the article before you form an opinion.</p>
<p>I would be worried about the liability surrounding injury while wearing Glass. Driving? Bicycling? Jogging? Escalators? Even city walking will become dangerous while you&rsquo;re wearing this device.</p>
<p>Or how about Airport Security? Banks? Government buildings? Financial institutions? The list goes on and on. &ldquo;Google Glass is not permitted on the premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to start wearing masks around or use facial image distortion gear to that we can retain some semblance of anonymity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Driving? Bicycling? Jogging? Escalators? Even city walking will become dangerous while you&rsquo;re wearing this device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All completely and utterly false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or how about Airport Security? Banks? Government buildings? Financial institutions? The list goes on and on. &ldquo;Google Glass is not permitted on the premises.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Places that restrict the use of cell phones and other devices which take photos and/or transmit/receive wireless data will likely also restrict the use of Glass.  That doesn&rsquo;t change the usefulness for the other 99% of the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to start wearing masks around or use facial image distortion gear to that we can retain some semblance of anonymity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why?  Do you already wear masks all the time?  You&rsquo;re already recorded nigh-constantly when you walk out your door.  Glass doesn&rsquo;t change that at all.  Why people think a video taken from first-person using Glass is so different from recording a video from a cell phone, or potential hidden cameras (which already exist) is beyond me.  The difference is convenience (its always at-the-ready).</p>
<p>Besides, you have no guarantee of privacy when in the public realm, you never have.</p>
<p>The guy wearing the glass looks like JP in grandmas boy</p>
<p>No no no Google&#8230; This is so far from the product it could be.</p>
<p>You need a control system that doesn&#8217;t require touching of the glasses perhaps even eye tracking or a controller within your pocket. That would be way more smooth and cool.</p>
<p>Also, there needs to be a better link with the smartphone. People who buy these will almost all exclusively own smart phones &#8211; if all the processing could be offloaded to a phone via Bluetooth ( not just the Internet), the glasses could be significantly thinner and  have better battery life.</p>
<p>You should also be able to communicate via your smartphone to your glasses. Say you look up directions to the British Museum. You should be able to flick the data on your phone straight to your glasses. This would also eliminate all the problems with sub par voice recognition.</p>
<p>Plus &#8211; please the design is not good. You can&#8217;t wear this thing in public. Just put the camera on a pair of raybans and use all the space you can for a battery &#8211; all processing takes place on the device.</p>
<p>Baby steps.</p>
<p>All I know is that for 1500 bucks, they better put an &ldquo;insane camera&rdquo; in this thing.</p>
<p>eagerly waiting to try them</p>
<p>This is a voyeurs wet dream. Prepare to be constantly photographed and filmed by neckbeard perverts.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s &ldquo;perverted&rdquo; about people taking pics of people in public?</p>
<p>Call me a pessimist (more of a realist) but I don&#8217;t think the world is ready for this tech yet. Technology is advancing before society&#8217;s culture, laws and ethics have the opportunity to adapt. People barely converse on a humanistic level during an outing for diner anymore. Just faces glued to their phones; texting and chatting. The driving laws are barely able to keep up with all these distractions. Privacy is being intruded on when voyeurs can video feed without any indication of doing so. 3d printers allowing people to create weapons. Hell, the majority of students and employees spend their valued time Facebooking or Tweeting or Pinteresting. It&#8217;s getting out of hand, <span class="caps">IMHO</span>.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t hold back the progress of technology just because laws won&rsquo;t adapt fast enough. We need to demand the same foresight from our lawmakers as the one our engineers and scientists do.</p>
<p>In the case of social interaction, people tend to make up the rules as they go (like not talking on the phone when you&rsquo;re on a date or in a closed space). Same principles apply.</p>

<p>Good lord this dude Josh has to make everything about himself.  Stop trying to be a personality dude and actually let the interview be about the people that are central to the story.</p>
<p>Over 1000 posts and only 11 references to porn?</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>Google Glasses are for people who <strong>want more distraction</strong>, not less. It&rsquo;s for people who want technology <strong>all the time</strong>, not just when they really need it. It <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> &ldquo;get out of the way&rdquo; when you don&rsquo;t need it &ndash; it stays on your head waiting to be used, distracting you in the process, probably even showing you Google ads for shtuff you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>The <strong>smartphone</strong> doesn&rsquo;t distract you in your pocket when you don&rsquo;t need it. The smartphone gets out of the way, unlike this.</p>
<p>They should stop pretending this is for regular people.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t understand how Glass works. If you get a notification, you get it and deal with it instantly, at which point the notifications go away from view. You&rsquo;re not constantly worried if you&rsquo;ll miss an important call or message. You don&rsquo;t have to check your phone every 5 minutes. Having that peace of mind is much less distracting than regularly checking the phone for alerts.</p>
<p>I think your open shirt with exposed chest hair and dangling scarf in the middle of winter is way more odd than the glasses. No?</p>
<p>If they could put all the hardware in my pocket and lose all the electronics on the Google Glass, it would be more appealing. Just make it wireless and have the software run on my phone. I expect that to happen if not the second gen, but the third iteration for sure.</p>
<p>The Swedish girl is pretty hot&#8230;that&#8217;s all I got out of that video.</p>
<p>Awful camera quality!!!</p>
<p>Your impressions and judgments are mostly fair, especially regarding how ridiculous it looks. But the thing I can&rsquo;t shake is this: most people are currently paying too much for 2-year commitments to state-of-the-art smartphones that already have the "ability to take photos and video with a &ldquo;you are there&rdquo; view. I won&rsquo;t lie, it&rsquo;s amazingly powerful (and more than a little scary) to be able to just start recording video or snapping pictures with a couple of flicks of your finger or simple voice commands."</p>
<p>Goes without saying that our smartphones also do just about everything else that Glass does, navigation, scheduling, etc. They just don&rsquo;t mount on our heads for hands-free use while we&rsquo;re ambulatory. So while it&rsquo;s an intriguing idea, it just looks like a smartphone that&rsquo;s permanently on your head, basically. Probably useful for some people in very specific situations, but hardly capable of cracking the mainstream. Glass&rsquo; geeky public cyborg look is not the only thing working against its commercial viability <span class="caps">IMHO</span>.</p>
<p>Also, while the Google dude was getting some attention from the ladies, and you secretly kept filming Starbucks employees, there will definitely be less-friendly reactions to seeing an always-on camera being aimed in one&rsquo;s direction once more of the public learn what this thing is.</p>
<p>Interesting concept though, and good article.</p>
<p>So I definitely want one, don&#8217;t care if I look out of place, I&#8217;ll deal with it. I am excited about the times we live in. And Mr Topolsky, I enjoy the way you write. Your style is lean and, to me it feels very original.</p>
<p>I agree. It looks somewhat unusual when you take close look&hellip;but it&rsquo;s similar enough to normal eyewear that it doesn&rsquo;t feel completely out of place. There&rsquo;s certainly been far more <a href="http://img.purseforum.com/attachments/premier-designers/dior/90300d1162764883-your-dior-sunglasses-dsc01142.jpg">upsetting recent trends in eyewear</a>.</p>
<p>I might be tempted to ease my way in with a baseball cap the first week or so, but in general, I think the design feels surprisingly familiar, and considerably less invasive than I first imagined.</p>
<p>God those are ugly. (in your link)</p>
<p>I went to the comment section to laugh as people made fun of this. My mind is blown. People actually want this!? Crazy, crazy.</p>
<p>So instead of everyone looking down at their smartphones, everyone will have their pupils looking up and to the right.  They still won&rsquo;t be paying any more attention or caring what the other person is saying or doing.  It&rsquo;ll just be easier for everyone to delude themselves that anybody else cares about them.</p>
<p>Heh.  I think this would be better if it just attached to the glasses you already have.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really curious to see how Google is going to implement this in the established industry which we know today. Will we be able to connect it to our home devices or a tablet? What new functions can we expect in the future? Will I be able to, let&rsquo;s say, stream a movie from my Netflix at home to Google Glasses through 4G or tethering options? Only time will tell, unfortunately.</p>
<p>It is definitely too expensive for me to become an early adopter in this obvious next step for the industry. A $1000-$1500 price tag is simply way too steep. I think it will take a few years and some good old competition to lower the price of such a device. I can&rsquo;t wait to use a device like Google Glasses in the near future.</p>
<p>Also, a great article Joshua. Really pleasant to read.</p>
<p>Deus Ex is becoming a reality</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://l.wigflip.com/p6zsDaKg/roflbot.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The possible help for people with certain disabilities are endless. This is a product with endless uses in today&rsquo;s everyday life. If they can get this product down to around $500.00 it will sell, it will sell allot of units. I want one, being in the construction field I can think of so many ways of using this. I have to have one. Innovation, innovation and more innovation. Google is pushing the envelope. This is a great time in the smartphone technology. Android is leading the charge.</p>
<p>Construction could use these big time. So many opportunities in most professions would have a use case for these</p>
<p>This is possibly the best-written, best filmed and best edited technology story I&rsquo;ve seen in at least 20 years of following consumer technology on the web. <span class="caps">CNET</span>, with all of the resources of <span class="caps">CBS</span>, hasn&rsquo;t done a story on Google Glass that even comes close to this piece. Thanks for the great work.</p>
<p>1) People do not want protruding objects on their faces. Generations of other inventions prove this instinct of human behavior. Google is letting their geek-blinders lead them to foolishness if they think its just a matter of modernity. There&rsquo;s a reason most Bluetooth phone mics are completely restrained to the ear&rsquo;s anatomy and don&rsquo;t wrap around to people&rsquo;s mouths. People don&rsquo;t like wraparound mics beyond closed situations &ndash; offices, cockpits, concert stages. Heck, even in the market of actual eyeglasses, theres a reason that contact lenses are so popular. We humans don&rsquo;t like objects protruding in <span class="caps">FRONT</span> of their face if they&rsquo;re not required.<br />
2) I agree the recent phenomenon of everyone staring down is weird but the whole &lsquo;being that person&rsquo; criticism is very shallow&hellip; you will be &ldquo;that&rdquo; person regardless of the device if that&rsquo;s the person you choose to be. And you won&rsquo;t be that person regardless of your device. <br />
3) As a society we have always been familiar with the concept of staring down and ignoring others in public when we&rsquo;re choosing to immerse ourselves in something &ndash; whether its a phone, a book, a map, a handheld game, etc. An interface on the tip of our eyelashes is not comparable to anything else in our public history and would require a leap of behavior not a mere evolution.<br />
4) The notion that she would wear Glass and be able to still interact with data while appearing to be interacting with the world implies a measure of phoniness that people rarely find compelling as a decision-factor. because you still have to ignore your surroundings to focus on a display regardless of how close it is to your senses. It doesn&rsquo;t take much for my own thoughts to pull me into ignoring my surroundings, and those are much closer to my senses than Glass could ever be.<br />
5) And don&rsquo;t for a second try to tell me constantly shifting my eyes&rsquo; from that closeup to far away won&rsquo;t have a negative effect on my vision. My vision is already deteriorating from having to constantly shift my focus from far away to a small touchscreen 1-foot away.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s your opinion not fact. Bluetooth mics and these glasses can not be compared. People have been wearing glasses and things on their face for centuries. You are being small minded and what won&#8217;t work for you might work for other people. The possibilities these glasses open up not just in consumer market but in enterprise would be enormous.</p>
<p>Read my point carefully. People have been wearing glasses for centuries, yes, but as necessity for the basic bodily function of correcting their sight. And as soon as contact lenses became widely available eyeglasses have steadily declined in usage. This is not just my opinion, this is an observable and measurable reality. And my Bluetooth mic example is not to say they are the same as glasses, but to illustrate our instinct to prefer the non-protruding version of a technology for many years now. Enterprise potential &ndash; yes. Enterprise is always a great place for innovations to find limited unscalable success. Consumer potential &ndash; historical clues point to not likely.</p>
<p>To clarify, in my opinion, success in enterprise occurring on an impersonal level is not scalable among main stream consumers. And therefore it defeats the whole angle Google is pitching of helping us be closer.</p>
<p>No I understand your point fine. Its natural progression of tech. This is how innovation starts and glasses are just the beginning of a star trek future. The reason these will be successful is because its the natural way tech is going. Glasses might not be very successful but what becomes of it in a decade I bet will. Probably won&#8217;t be glass anymore and more of an implant but t has to start somewhere. Can&#8217;t interpret the past to mean the future especially when future tech will be even greater than what we have now. It being successful in enterprise first is fine because then that usually means it will penetrate the consumer market with success.</p>
<p>Actually I know a lot of people who wear lens-less glasses purely because they think it looks cool.  Granted, those are generally hipsters wearing the thick frames, but that says to me people don&rsquo;t mind putting things on their faces as much as you think.  You know what looks worse that a pair of glasses on your face?  Those hideous steel balls that girls pierce into their cheeks and nose and eyebrows and all sorts of other less than aesthetically pleasing  or flattering ways.</p>
<p>Have they considered maybe including some sort of <span class="caps">LED</span> to indicate to others when the camera&rsquo;s on? That might head off some of the social issues that are probably going to arise with this thing.</p>
<p>Good idea. <br />
I wonder if Google is hesitant to do that because they are trying hard to make the glasses seem as inconspicuous as possible, and they figure people would be reluctant to have a blinking light on their face every time they take a video or photo.<br />
Maybe if you have to hold your finger on the device while capturing video that could be a less harsh indicator?</p>
<p>I can now post to Facebook from my glasses!</p>
<p>I made this picture in 1992 dreaming about those glasses.<br /><img title="" src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/69774076@N02/8500878805/in/photostream" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is an excellent article. One of the few long write-ups you&rsquo;ve done where I&rsquo;ve read the entire thing start to finish. Google Glass, stuff like this is what makes me feel like we&rsquo;re in the future. I can&rsquo;t believe this might come out at the end of the year. We&rsquo;ve made it people.</p>
<p>As amazing as this product proves to be and even considering the insane level of innovation we see pouring out from the creative minds at google&hellip; I am still thinking that this product is incredible because&hellip; well&hellip; did you all even <span class="caps">SEE</span> how <span class="caps">HOT</span> Josh Topolsky looks in the <span class="caps">GLASS</span>?  <span class="caps">OMG</span>- no offense Josh T. but I saw that picture of you pop up on my Verge App on my phone and I did a double take and had to go read the article with the hot guy&hellip; then I realized &ndash; <span class="caps">OMG</span> &ndash; that&rsquo;s Josh!!!  Dude &ndash; they need to make you their spokeperson/model for <span class="caps">GLASS</span>!!!! <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">ROCK</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> <span class="caps">LOOK</span>!  =)   True Story!   &lt;3</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing this is the first generation product.  This has potential to change everything in coming years&hellip;.The possibilities are endless if you could convert 40-50% of your heads-down time on a smartphone into a heads-up experience.</p>
<p>It also may be ahead of its time, but you just need famous people wearing them (because they are useful and a status symbol), and the people will follow.</p>
<p>(And a thousand times more innovative than a play-it-safe iWatch that will somehow &lsquo;save&rsquo; Apple.)</p>
<p>Can you reverse the eye position? I can&#8217;t see out of my right eye very well.</p>
<p>Is it just me or does this guy come off as sort of Dickish?  I know journalists often ask interesting or even tough questions, but I wasn&rsquo;t getting that vibe here.  Maybe snarky is a better term.  The Google people did a good job of tolerating it but I&rsquo;ll bet it was the first comment made privately.</p>
<p>This will be my Christmas gift to me. <br />
I&rsquo;m excited for these. <br />
Also now solders can use this like uav on call of duty aha</p>
<p>Fail.  Voice interface all the time just ain&rsquo;t going to work.  Fine line between cool lab experiment and mass market consumer product.</p>
<p>I think what it shows is potential for  a head mounted camera iPhone/Android accessory.</p>
<p>Otherwise don&rsquo;t see the attraction.  Just because screen is in your field of vision doesn&rsquo;t mean you are paying attention to where you are going or what is happening in front of you.   You can only focus on one thing.</p>
<p>Typical Google too.  Alpha/Beta products.  Works for software because it is free.  Not so much for hardware.</p>
<p>The hardware has touch interaction so you can physically activate functions, not all voice. Good job dismissing a product without actually reading the text.</p>
<p>Can it read power levels?</p>
<p>Sounds like it&#8217;ll be a great device. I myself have noticed how everyone has their nose buried in their phone these days. It&#8217;s innovations like this that are the future. Man and tech working together naturally. No wonder Google&#8217;s stock is approaching $800! Great article guys!</p>
<p>Wow! This is definitely the future!</p>
<p>The writing, photography, and video production is best in class. Nothing else I&rsquo;ve read about Glass has made me both better understand or more deeply desire getting my hands on the product.</p>
<p>Another exceptional piece guys, please keep it up.</p>
<p>Just wanted to write another comment to say: Besides liking Google Glass a lot, yeah, nice layout and excellent writing on the article, too =)<br />
(I forgot writing that in my other comment since i so take that for granted from Josh and the verge, but yeah, should be said once in a while anyway, thanks guys =) )<br />
One thing i wondered about regarding Glass though: Does it recognise your voice to identify you?<br />
Just wondered thinking about what would happen if several people have it on and one speaks the commands, it should recognise the user by the voice to not get confused by the voice of others then.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they either are working on it, or have it figured out already. Some bluetooth earpieces already incorporate bone conduction technology to filter out external noise not coming from the user. They could do something like this here.</p>
<p>Correct.  And Glass does indeed incorporate bone conduction tech, so I don&rsquo;t think this is going to be a problem.</p>
<p>So how long before people start wearing these without getting the your a dumbass look from the general public</p>
<p>Glass seems more ordinary and less exciting in action than I had imagined. I&rsquo;m actually now more excited about the Apple wearable (based on that patent filing).</p>
<p>The bigger story here is the story itself. This is outstanding journalism. If there isn&rsquo;t a plan to start charging a subscription for the in-depth pieces like this, there should be. I&rsquo;d pay. It&rsquo;s such a great experience coming to The Verge for a quick catch-up on the latest news and getting sucked into some serious analysis of something important, and it&rsquo;s happening more and more frequently :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the article didn&rsquo;t highlight the possibility of live translation using Google Translate.</p>
<p>I must say that I was skeptical when I first heard about Google Glass but after reading this article I&#8217;m convinced. While I don&#8217;t believe that the product will catch on with the mainstream public I do believe that the product will catch on within the tech community. Who knows, that may be what the product needs in the short term.</p>
<p>Great job again Joshua! I really enjoy reading and going over all the coverage you gives us keep up the great job!<br />
For all you apple/android/google elitist,get over yourself. They are all fine products you may like one over another and that&rsquo;s great. Choice is good/healthy.</p>
<p>Josh never looked so good. I call Photoshop&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t unsee the resemblance to Steve Merchant though.</p>
<p>I love, want, and will have at some point, but, early adopters will be a magnet for muggers &rsquo;til this is mainstream. <br />
At least your phone is in your pocket a lot of the time..</p>
<p>I love this idea, but I&rsquo;m really nervous we&rsquo;ll all look like idiots looking up into the upper right of our field of vision all the time.</p>
<p>Hopefully future iterations will come up with a better display method.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m praying that Google Glass would work with an iPhone!</p>
<p>Of course it would. It works with any internet connection.</p>
<p>More exceptional content from The Verge.</p>
<p>The question should be &ldquo;When Google will roll out wireless broadband&rdquo; Glass needs excellent wireless service to work.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited with Glass and I think it looks good enough, but it makes me wonder: can&rsquo;t they make the &ldquo;lens&rdquo; look like a normal glass lens, instead of a rectangular block attachment at the upper right of your vision? Surely if they can make it like that, they can <em>normalize</em> it further by incorporating the screen to the actual lens therefore making it look like an ordinary pair of glasses?</p>
<p>Not everyone wears glasses.</p>
<p>Yes&hellip; but that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad Josh isn&rsquo;t writing for a fashion magazine because if he thinks that&rsquo;s a great looking design, he needs a thicker pair of glasses.  But then again, he raves about pretty much every design that comes across his desk and says that&rsquo;s the best design he&rsquo;s ever seen or will compare it favorably to Apple&rsquo;s.  Then when he reviews an Apple product, he&rsquo;ll praise it and trash all those products that he recently reviewed as being awesome&hellip; then the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>It seems kind of cool in a sci-fi movie sort of way, but I have <em>serious</em> doubts about the ability of most people to see this display without straining the hell out of your eyes. I have very good vision and can comfortably focus on text perhaps 4 inches from my eye, but this screen is what, 1 inch away?</p>
<p>Pick up a printed page right now and hold some text 1" from your eye and see what the experience is like. Am I missing something here? If I&rsquo;m wrong about this I wouldn&rsquo;t mind someone explaining to me how I would not have trouble focusing on this.</p>
<p>This is why there&rsquo;s that block of lens in between the projector and your eye, to refract, reflect, and collimate the image so that it focuses on your retina at infinity.  If you&rsquo;re looking at a newspaper a foot from your face and glance up and right, it&rsquo;ll be in focus.  If you&rsquo;re looking at a mountain in the distance and look up and right it&rsquo;ll still be in focus.  Your eye does <span class="caps">NOT</span> have to change its focus to see the image.  If this was just a simple display on a pair of glasses, we would have had these years ago.  Getting the image to focus properly at that distance was part of the trick.</p>
<p>Hmm &ndash; I think Warren Ellis&rsquo; <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">INEXORABLE</span> <span class="caps">RISE</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">CRAPJECTS</span> article today on Vice Beta is a good antidote to all this fawning. Go read it and reflect.</p>
<p>I agree with Josh, it is interesting that as we seek more human interaction we are distancing our selves more from humans and the reality as we augment our reality. We seek only an aspect of what in reality the whole experience is, as we try to control the reality by selecting what we want and what we don&rsquo;t want. As Agent Smith explains in the original matrix, we human species cant survive in a &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; world we need the human touch of imperfection, pain sorrow suffering, its the true human condition.</p>
<p>That one picture showing those guys with the big cams.<br />
Are you sure that girl with the golden hair &amp; glass didn&rsquo;t come back from the future?</p>
<p>Josh really put some writing behind this, its ok but I would love more technical info. The 1st half is about the magical wait and magical unicorn experience, too few words about the device itself.</p>
<p>I put my sunglasses and look up, it does not feels natural, it even hurts. I wonder how much you have to look up, why is the initial setup so important, what kind of display technology they use, why too thick glass, etc</p>
<p>My last 2 words are: chest &hellip; hair &hellip;</p>
<p>If it hurts, you&rsquo;re probably looking too far.  Though with no actual display to look at, that&rsquo;s not surprising.  Personally I often look up over my glasses (mostly because my laptop and monitor aren&rsquo;t at the same height and I don&rsquo;t always tilt my head back to look at the former through the lens) and it feels quite comfortable.  I can&rsquo;t say for certain, though, as I&rsquo;ve not had the opportunity to try them out, but I&rsquo;m guessing its not placed so far away from our normal <span class="caps">FOV</span> as to be difficult or straining to use.</p>
<p>Its major use-case &ndash; video recording/transmission without having to resort to holding a phone &ndash; along with its incorporation of aggregative Google Now features will make it imperative to have super-fast data (<span class="caps">LTE</span> or further-iterated HSPA+) on phones. I think the basic necessity of super-fast data is what will separate it most clearly from smartphones, which by and large can muddle along with just 3G/HSPA+ in 99% of use cases:</p>

<p>Videos like these need to be longer than 5 minutes, Topolsky.</p>
<p>Will these be available in the UK</p>
<p>Man, it&rsquo;s like Game of Thrones&hellip; release date <em>just can&rsquo;t come fast enough.</em></p>
<p>I just wish it looked more like the glasses used in the anime &ldquo;Dennou Coil&rdquo;.</p>
<p>topolsky&hellip;your right ear is higher than your left.</p>
<p>Wow, stupid.</p>
<p>Also, talk about making yourself a target for a good ol&rsquo; fashion mugging.</p>
<p>Because I know I like to live my life in persistent fear of assholes mugging me.  Also, I&rsquo;ll laugh hysterically as they&rsquo;re carted off to jail over an electronic gizmo.  Cause, you know, instant-on video camera on my face that can upload videos directly to the cloud and all.</p>
<p>Personally I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all afraid of muggers or other assholes.  As the meme says, Come at me, bro!</p>
<p>Get a real job and move out of the projects. Most of us aren&rsquo;t mugged every time we step outside of our homes with something of relative value on our person.</p>
<p>The verge is the best Tech. News site. Their videos and articles are amazing ! Thank you !</p>
<p>Here a quick design-remix, which I think would minimize the weirdness caused by the obstructiveness of the glasses.  Just an idea&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="Google glass design remix" src="http://www.starluxstudios.com/app_images/common/google_glass_remixed.png" alt="Google glass design remix" /></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why but for some reason the bottom picture makes him look douchey. <span class="caps">LOL</span></p>
<p>Well, I mirrored the eye from the left-side, so it&rsquo;s not quite him.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that would work.  That glass block isn&rsquo;t a stand-alone display.  Unless I&rsquo;m terribly mistaken, the image is generated and projected out of the black part (that you put on top) and is collimated and reflected into the eye by the glass block lens.</p>
<p>Personally I think it looks better on the bottom too.</p>
<p>Actually, I think you could improve the design by mirroring the glasses, to take into account the left-gaze bias in emotion reading in humans ( we tend to look at the right eye of other people, first, when trying to read emotions ).  On that basis, it would make sense to have the right side of the face be as unobstructed as possible.</p>
<p>Info on left-gaze bias:</p>
<p>Research:  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18925420" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18925420</a><br />

<p>We&rsquo;re witnessing the dawn of the era of douche-tech.</p>
<p>Rejoice, those of you for whom the Bluetooth earpiece simply wasn&rsquo;t douchey enough. Your prayers have been answered.</p>
<p>Says the douchey anon who likes to judge people on superficial things.  Seriously, the people complaining about people using bluetooth always seemed <span class="caps">FAR</span> more like huge douches than the people actually using a headset for whatever personal reasons.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.starluxstudios.com/app_images/common/google_glass_remixed2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Exactly &ndash; great illustration, and the lower one looks clearly <strong>way</strong> better. You&rsquo;d think this is design 101.</p>
<p>Thank you!  I agree that it is somewhat obvious &mdash; then again, it&rsquo;s way easier to improve something that already exists, than coming up with it in the first place&hellip;</p>
<p>Forgive this copy|paste:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that would work. That glass block isn&rsquo;t a stand-alone display. Unless I&rsquo;m terribly mistaken, the image is generated and projected out of the black part (that you put on top) and is collimated and reflected into the eye by the glass block lens.  They pretty much have to be next to one another to function.</p>
<p>Personally I think it looks better on the bottom too, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak against personal preference, but it&rsquo;s hard to disagree that the current design obstructs peripheral vision and the critical right-eye region ( left-gaze bias ).  As it is, it is very conspicuous, even bothersome when looking at the wearer&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I think fitting the prism as illustrated could be made to work:  maybe not exactly as illustrated, but something like that.  Note:  I added a little extra tab above the prism to fit the projection element, maybe, though I don&rsquo;t how much room is needed.</p>
<p>Sorry SRPuffinStuff, I misread your comment:  I thought you liked the top one better.</p>
<p>The display needed to be bigger though. The way it is the display would easily break and could go into his eyes.</p>
<p>I agree.  In the proposed revision, above, safety could be a greater issue than in the original design &mdash; which, incidentally, doesn&rsquo;t seem entirely safe either!</p>
<p>One way to improve safety, as you suggested, would be to widen the prism so that it connects to the frame over a greater surface area, increasing robustness, and yielding what could potentially be &lsquo;wide-screen&rsquo; google glass ( not shown )!</p>
<p>Another way might be to change display technologies entirely, and use semi-transparent, flexible <span class="caps">OLED</span> ( think: soft and flexible, like a contact lens ), which might look something like this, maybe:</p>

<p>It reminds me of MomCorp&rsquo;s the eyePhone from Futurama :-)<br />
Attack of the Killer App!!! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Killer_App" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_of_the_Killer_App</a></p>
<p>The thing that turns me off about this is the heavy reliance on voice commands. It&rsquo;s not always possible to talk out loud when you want to do something on your device. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why texting is more popular than phone calls these days. Can you imagine being at a sporting event and having an idiot sitting behind you shouting &ldquo;OK <span class="caps">GLASS</span> <span class="caps">TAKE</span> A <span class="caps">PHOTO</span>&rdquo; ad nauseum?</p>
<p>I had similar thoughts on this. If this device could take commands from eye movements and winking. And a parson making odd eye movements looks less strange then someone talking to him/her self :-)</p>
<p>That is what the Touch Pad is for.</p>
<p>Is it just me or does anybody else also think that Josh is being a little too full of himself. I am not one to attack a person, but this is starting to get to me. Dude, you are a journalist, you haven&rsquo;t built shit, all you do is review stuff. Remember that!!!</p>
<p>All the guys who actually built the stuff, including the guys in the Google glass video look more humble than Josh. Being on Jimmy Falon doesn&rsquo;t make you great. Get a grip. See the guys rolling their eyes when Josh declared to them that SeaBreeze was a better name?</p>
<p>How long will it take before the first Glass user steps off a curb and get&rsquo;s hit by a bus while they&rsquo;re distracted using this <span class="caps">HUD</span>?</p>
<p>A lot longer than it took the first Smartphone user to do the same thing.  Kinda the point.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s alright, isn&#8217;t she! ;)</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s X Lab was responsible for neural networks? Ha ha ha ha ha ha.<br />
Google&rsquo;s X Lab may be good, but as yet they haven&rsquo;t invented time travel.</p>
<p>This is awesome!<br />
Now all I need is a jet pack and a flying car XD</p>
<p>With the Friendship Cube Group, we are focussed on virtual reality and augmented reality interactions that enhance daily life.  There are lots of possibilities for friendship cube code interaction increase with augmented reality technologies like Google Glass.  The visual binary code becomes an intuitive guiding window via the augmentation screen.  I hope to design some software that enables people to interact using friendship cube technology.  And combine Google Glass with the Emotiv <span class="caps">EEG</span> headset. We could design a headset that has both a neuro-signals acquisition device and screens that show our symbols, as well as a camera.  So the idea is that you have a screen on your clothes where people can see your latest tweet update. You have 1 or more cameras linked to your body, conveniently next to your eyes.</p>

<p>This is probably the best article I&#8217;ve ever read! Great content and very well written (well, anything by Josh is awesome :D)</p>
<p>Very cool article.</p>
<p>Once people start owning these devices and they become somewhat commonplace, they won&rsquo;t look so odd anymore.  I remember back when cell phones really started to penetrate into the consumer space, hearing a phone ring and seeing someone talk randomly in public was odd.  Then I became one of those people&hellip; and gradually so did everyone else.</p>
<p>Million of lawyers are rejoicing in the plethora of lawsuits that will result from mass adoption of this product. Examples include radiation causing cancer, accidents from distracted driving,  videos of illegal acts being committed and transmitted live. Sorry to dwell on the dark side of this wonderful product but the problems are there.</p>
<p>this wouldn&rsquo;t cause cancer.  I mean, it /could/, but so could going out into the sun.  This would also allow people to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.  A notification popping up shouldn&rsquo;t be any more distracting than a billboard, or your <span class="caps">GPS</span>, or changing the radio.</p>
<p>Criminals being caught easier would be a good thing, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Anyone else chuckle when they read this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cashier seemed to be on <strong>the verge</strong> of asking me what I was wearing on my face</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yep</p>
<p>amazing!!!</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m late to the show here, but I&rsquo;ve got a couple things to say.</p>
<p>1. Wearables are the next &ldquo;revolutionary products&rdquo;. I haven&rsquo;t seen a revolutionary product since the iPhone. Will Glass be <span class="caps">THE</span> revolutionary product to attract imitators? Maybe. But an obvious leapfrog will be wearable contact lenses. Maybe the tech is delayed, but if Apple or some other competitor enters the space with contact lenses, <span class="caps">GAME</span> <span class="caps">OVER</span>.</p>
<p>2. Just for fun: Image wearing Glass in your car and launching the Accelerometer app. No more distration of looking down at your speedometer while driving. Pretty rad in theory.</p>
<p>Wow awesome article hope I will one of the ones picked to buy it early</p>
<p>How long is this going to stay on the front page?</p>
<p>Innovation without disruption is novelty, not innovation. Google&rsquo;s Glass and Pixel are pixie dust, not products. Pure puerile posturing. When Apple produced the iPhone and iPad, it manned up with real live CE products that uprooted multiple market sectors. Google&rsquo;s prices tell it all: Even Google does not believe these toys are tools.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Google&rsquo;s completely asleep at the switch, and Samsung is milking Android for all its worth. And it&rsquo;s using those billions to build its own brand at Google&rsquo;s expense. Can a Samsung OS and search be far behind? Google has a tiger by the tail. It&rsquo;s a highly unstable relationship, more so than the Apple and Samsung competition, which is pretty well sorted out. And both Google and Samsung are proven to be duplicitous. Remember the iPhone.</p>
<p>Five years from now, the mobile market will include Apple, Samsung, and Google, in that order. And that&rsquo;s on a good day. Without its own hardware to compete with Samsung, Google will end up like Adobe, begging to get on other companies&rsquo; hardware platforms. Larry and Sergey better stop reading their own publicity notices, get their heads out of their labs, and get on with the real work of business.</p>
<p>I just hope you can rename it, like Jarvis, or Monita</p>
<p>I might be the only one who doesn&rsquo;t like the concept of Google Glass. I spent over $3000 dollars so I could get rid of glasses, and that includes the frames, so I don&rsquo;t want something I have to wear in the same way that I used to wear glasses. I also don&rsquo;t want Google Contacts (trademarked by me./s) because, and trust me on this one especially, that is a worse feeling than wearing glasses. The idea is nice, but having come from a life where I had to alternate between the two if I wanted to see, wearing something even close to glasses is not a feeling I want to relive. Even sunglasses bother me, and I only wear them when driving when I absolutely have to.</p>
<p>In other news: Cool Story Bro!</p>
<p>Interesting concept there&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="Nexus Glasses" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/290035_451663448215519_1567241074_o.jpg" alt="Nexus Glasses" /></p>
<p>Maybe a way for a &lsquo;geeky-less&rsquo; design. Okay the prisms there are b*llsh*t, but anyway looks cool.</p>
<p>Where does it store the content? Is there integrated memory?</p>
<p>Great article. But I am not sure I like this future. It reminds me of the film Brainstorm, from 1983, with Christopher Walken and Nathalie Wood. It freaked me out as a kid when I saw it on cable and the Google Glass demo video, while awe inspiring, is equally as freaky. It&rsquo;s not quite at that level of technology&mdash; Brainstorm featured a device that could record your brainwaves and replay them to anyone wearing the device. Strange Days had a similar motif.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s frightening is the privacy implications. Big Brother isn&rsquo;t a leader&rsquo;s poster with a camera on a wall, it&rsquo;s whoever is standing right in front of you, wearing glass. Privacy is over. In the future, glass, combined with facial recognition software and an always on internet connection could provide everything anyone wants to know about you as you walk down the street. If they can get into public databases they can find out where you live without following you home. And that&rsquo;s without mentioning the back end, whatever you can see anyone else can see too, if they can interrupt the data stream. Sure, all of this can be done now, but not as easily as it will be. Brave new world&hellip;</p>
<p>And this is how it begins!</p>

<p>Amazing video! I want a google glass right now!</p>
<p>Screw Glass, how does one obtain the same level of swagger that Josh has?</p>
<p><span class="caps">THX</span> Josh for this great article! One of the best pieces i have ever read/watched!</p>
<p>All I can really say is if they are like they are on Google&rsquo;s videos and have the same features then it will be something to look forward too. Apart from the $1000+ of-course.</p>
<p>these should&rsquo;ve been google goggles and because they are not i will never support this.</p>
<p>Great article! I wish these were available when my kid was a baby. With having your hands full with a baby these do come handy to capture most of the beautiful moments I now rarely remember.</p>
<p>Wow this article was just beautiful. Google really has something up its sleeve cant wait to see this in production.</p>
<p>This dude seems extraordinarily hung up on how this device looks, self consciousness on overdrive. I think they look fine and don&rsquo;t think it would be long before the electronics could be almost totally integrated with the frame. Then the point is moot and a large chunk of this article with it.<br />
Good writing, but a bit too much personal insecurity for my tastes.</p>
<p>Okay.  I&rsquo;ll be honest.  I would love real life spell check.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard either, because they already have the technology in their Google Translate app for android.  It just view what you&rsquo;re doing live, and voila.  Corrects you&hellip;</p>

<p>And what do you do when you want to wear some stylish sunglasses&hellip; And use Glass at the same time?</p>
<p>Implying that non-stylish ones aren&#8217;t an issue?</p>
<p>Implying sunglasses are stylish by definition :D</p>
<p>my nintendo virtual boy did more than this&hellip; i honestly dont see the innovation</p>
<p>is this a joke? you&rsquo;re virtual boy was portable enough to wear on your head, had translation capabilities, could save and tell you information about the environment your in or close to, had a connection to the internet, while being almost non-intrusive to your field of view?</p>
<p>I hope they come up with a solution for people who already wear glasses.</p>
<p>Give it 5 or 10 years &ndash; these will be standard along with transition lenses.</p>
<p>If these are the norm in 5-10 years &amp; everyone&rsquo;s walking around talking to themselves/people who aren&rsquo;t physically there, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll want to live on this planet anymore.</p>
<p>What like when they are on a phone these days?</p>
<p>At least you&rsquo;ll be handsfree while you&rsquo;re peeing ;)</p>
<p>And while you are at it, you can take a pic of d1ck to share on Google+ too ;-)</p>
<p>sexting is about to get a lot better.</p>
<p><span class="caps">POV</span>! awwwwww yeah!</p>
<p>prepare yourself then.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what people w/bluetooth headsets do?</p>
<p>and aren&rsquo;t they pretty universally considered to be douchebags?</p>
<p>Its tech, it has its uses and they work pretty well for what they are supposed to do, if people want to start calling them douchebags for essentially being open to new ideas and innovations, they can pretty much go to <del>hell</del></p>
<p>Not sure what you&rsquo;re referring to.  I was referring to when I see a guy in suit a coffee shop or an airport slowly pacing and yelling into his bluetooth because the microphone is now farther away from his mouth.  That&rsquo;s the most common way I see people use bluetooth, and I always think douchebag.</p>
<p>In the Glass video I saw people pretty much whispering to the device, so hopefully that won&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<p>Well then they&rsquo;re idiots. A good bluetooth headset offers very good microphone quality when you&rsquo;re basically whispering into the thing, thanks to bone conduction and better/cheaper mic tech.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no different than people screaming into their phones when it&rsquo;s up to their ear. But I completely agree that people who scream their phone conversations so loud that everyone in the room can hear them are idiots. Annoys me to no end, actually.</p>
<p>I have a feeling those people you are referring to are speaking louder than normal because they want to draw attention, and not because they have to raise their voice for the BT mic to pick them up.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the type that wear them around 24/7 unnecessarily because they think it makes them look important, or because to them it&rsquo;s some sort of status symbol (kinda like taking pictures in public with your tablet when your phone is right there in your pocket).</p>
<p>Douches.</p>
<p>The rest who use them like they&rsquo;re supposed to simply because it makes things easier? They&rsquo;re OK in my book.</p>
<p>agreed</p>
<p>bluetooth ear pieces suck, unless its amazing expensive, and no one has those. Google glass will only be amazing expensive. They probably won&rsquo;t suck. I think people who use bluetooth pieces and yell at them are behind the technology curve. Someone else paired that bluetooth for them. They don&rsquo;t know how it works, and they yell because they are on a cellphone regardless of ear piece or not. Google glass is not going to appeal to people who don&rsquo;t completely get it, especially for $1500. Being hyper-connected could be a social etiquette faux pas, for using a distracting device during a conversation with a person who is right next to them. But, a hands-free always available computer interface is going to be most useful when your hands are occupied. Meaning if you didn&rsquo;t already have them on you are not going to be able to put them on. Eliminating their most useful feature.<br />
People using them will probably look derision worthy in some way, I guess pretentious.</p>

<p>Status symbols are pretty huge. See my previous comment about idiots taking pictures with tablets when they have better cameras on their hips. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter how ridiculous you look, as long as you think other people are looking on in jealousy.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re attempting to interpret why they&rsquo;re yelling? I&rsquo;d guess that they&rsquo;d be yelling whether they were on the phone or bluetooth. I don&rsquo;t see anyone yelling into bluetooth because it&rsquo;s far from their mouth any more.</p>
<p><img title="talking to themselves" src="http://steigerlaw.typepad.com/photos/hot_hands_free_devices/001_plantronics_voyager_520.jpg" alt="talking to themselves" /></p>
<p>Its been the norm for 5-10 years now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;the norm&rsquo;? More like a corner case. Very few are willing to put silly looking tech on their bodies.</p>
<p>You are aware on the invention called the phone, right? And bluetooth headsets? Are you sure you want to live on this planet <strong>now</strong>?</p>
<p>People&rsquo;vhave been doing that since The Advent Of the mobile. You shouldve left already</p>
<p>&ldquo;If facebook and mobile phones is the norm and everyone&rsquo;s walking around talking to themselves/people who aren&rsquo;t physically there, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll want to live on this planet anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There fixed it for you&hellip;</p>
<p>Bluetooth?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what your dad said about cellphones. He is still here.</p>
<p>You only realised that now?</p>
<p>In ten years they&rsquo;ll probably be contact lenses.</p>
<p>No thanks. Had transitions. They transition all the time when it&rsquo;s overcast (aka every day in Oregon) and look idiotic. I&rsquo;ll just take the transparent screens as lenses and skip the transitions, thanks.</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve already said they&rsquo;re working on that. Can&rsquo;t remember where i read that though&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah they did</p>
<p>Reckon you could use them on your bike linked in to <span class="caps">STRAVA</span> etc?</p>
<p>there already is..</p>
<p>They are not glasses, they go overtop. There are pictures of people wearing them who wear glasses.</p>
<p>I really think Google is launching that product <strong>way</strong> to soon.<br />
They should wait until glass display became a reality, so that it could be an actual glass. That piece of glass (???) on the top of the eye is just&hellip; weird. <strong>Really weird</strong>.<br />
They need real display lenses to turn this device into a mass market, I guess.</p>
<p>What Google is doing now is just like Apple introducing an iPhone in 2005, with a resistive screen. Technology isn&rsquo;t here yet :/</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still being polished, but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>I would say Glass follow the traditional Google way of launching product: it&rsquo;s a beta.<br />
Probably the real product we&rsquo;re hoping for will hit the market in 3 or 4 years.</p>
<p>Launching beta software is different than launching beta hardware. They should have learned their lesson after Google TV <span class="caps">STB</span> debacles.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that this thing will catch on until the device is indecipherable from a standard pair of eyeglasses. People don&rsquo;t want to look like cyborgs. I could be wrong, though, given the proliferation of bluetooth headsets.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have the same opinion. It&rsquo;s just weird. That design makes you feel like a nerd (in the bad way).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll get there. In the 1-2 decade timespan I fully expect this tech to be baked into contact lenses. Crazy ass shit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s physically impossible to focus on something that is literally on your eye, so unless people are having surgery to change their eyes this won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Google TV?  Try Nexus Q, happened just last year.</p>
<p>The beta is going on right now (hence the article).</p>
<p>Display glass, as in a transparent screen, wouldn&rsquo;t work. The screen is way too close to your eye for it to focus. There is a prototype device that does this, but it requires the user to wear a special contact lens. Google Glass uses that block of (glass?) to project an image directly onto the the user&rsquo;s retina. I don&rsquo;t see that technology being replaced any time soon.</p>
<p>Google Glass isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;projecting an image directly onto the user&rsquo;s retina&rdquo; (unless you consider using a regular <span class="caps">LCD</span> screen projecting an image directly onto the user&rsquo;s retina, which in a way it is doing), its simply using some tricks in focusing to make the image appear in focus a little bit in front of you instead of only inches in front of you.</p>
<p>Its the same concept as a <span class="caps">HUD</span> on a jet fighter&rsquo;s helmet or those little <span class="caps">HUD</span> screens they make for skiing.</p>
<p>Google glass projects image into the retina? Where did you read that? That&rsquo;s new for me!<br />
The focusing point it important, yet with some 3D display technology they could create (I don&rsquo;t know if this is possible) a virtual (in the sense of not real) image that stays on a comfortable distance, like what happens with virtual images on mirrors.</p>
<p>Technically anything you look at is projecting an image onto your retina. That is the definition of vision.</p>
<p>You mean, Google is launching that product way too soon?</p>
<p>The technology isn&rsquo;t ready yet.</p>
<p>You work at google?</p>
<p>Look at the device. The technology isn&rsquo;t here yet. If it was, you wouldn&rsquo;t look ridiculous using that thing.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right. The technology isn&rsquo;t here yet (that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not on retail).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it was, you wouldn&rsquo;t look ridiculous using that thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet we look ridiculous every day using a lot of different technologies.</p>
<p>Wow.  I look at the current version of Glass and think that the technology is absolutely here.  Josh, who has actually used this now, agrees.  How you look when you use it has nothing to do with whether the technology is &ldquo;here yet&rdquo;.  See the pic below; I wouldn&rsquo;t say that smartphone technology &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t here yet&rdquo; but these people look plenty ridiculous.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cf.ltkcdn.net/cellphones/images/std/131680-400x281-collegephones.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing like that. Google isn&rsquo;t even &ldquo;launching&rdquo; this right now. They are giving it to very specific people to develope the tech. I&rsquo;d guess it&rsquo;s a couple years before we actually see it available for sale to anyone that wants it. They&rsquo;re basically hiring engineers that don&rsquo;t work for them to develop this for free. It&rsquo;s like open source software or something. It&rsquo;s a great idea because they aren&rsquo;t limiting development to their own engineers and at the same time are establishing themselves as the go-to company for this future tech.</p>
<p>The video says this will be on sale in a polished, retail version by the end of the year to normal (but wealthy) people.</p>
<p>They are developing the software to accompany it. If they had released it when they thought that all the technological pieces were there, they would have been behind. Solve the software issue first and then improve the physical design later. Some companies have amazing hardware <b>cough <span class="caps">HTC</span> cough</b> but just &ldquo;Throw stuff at the market&rdquo; in terms of software and see what sticks. They are solving the one thing that really matters first, user interface.</p>
<p>Then you don&rsquo;t really understand what this was suppose to be, and now you are sounding like someone who does. By design its suppose to be above the eye where it can&rsquo;t be distract you as you go about your day but if you need it you just look up and say &ldquo;okay google&rdquo; to activate and give your command.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about that, it&rsquo;s about the design itself.<br />
It&rsquo;s ugly, big, asymmetrical, weird.</p>
<p>Well it&rsquo;s official, some guy who talks too much on the internet thinks the design is weird. Can the project now</p>

<p>You mean a <span class="caps">PDA</span>?  I actually had one of those.  It was actually pretty nice, and it&rsquo;s the reason I was rather suspicious of the iPhone&rsquo;s touchscreen, since I didn&rsquo;t see how you could have the necessary precision without a stylus.</p>

<p>Check out the gallery at the bottom of the article, there&rsquo;s a picture of someone wearing them with sunglasses so I shouldn&rsquo;t imagine clear lenses would be an issue.</p>
<p>It clips onto existing frames, and that includes &ldquo;stylish&rdquo; sunglasses.</p>
<p>They already have.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/12/google-project-glass-with-glasses/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/12/google-project-glass-with-glasses/</a></p>
<p>They have already stated that it can be worn by people who already wear glasses.  If you search around, there are some spy shots with people wearing the Google Glass over their prescription glasses. I wear glasses (sometimes) and that was the first thing I keyed in on. So no worries!</p>
<p>They also had shots of a sunglasses version of Google Glass.</p>
<p>Edit &ndash; Beaten badly. Should have refreshed my page before responding.</p>
<p>This <strong>is</strong> the solution. It is designed to be detachable and compatible with most if not all types of frames.</p>
<p>i think they already did</p>
<p>There is a picture of a version with sunglasses embedded on their homepage. Maybe you can&rsquo;t use your own glasses but they will have you covered some how.</p>
<p>According to the official <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/">Project Glass website</a>, the &ldquo;glass&rdquo; will be more of a frame that sits on your current glasses, rather than an actual pair of glasses.</p>
<p>I watched an interview with Sergey Brin where he was wearing Glass &ldquo;on top of&rdquo; sun glasses. I think the lenses can be customized or might even be interchangable. Like papa528 said, it&rsquo;s more of a frame which you can turn into whatever you want &ndash; sunglasses/prescription glasses/ski goggles?</p>
<p>Look at the 4th and 10th picture&hellip;</p>
<p>Here you go :</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like ads for glasses, they look good, but I can&rsquo;t help but think that the models would look better without them on&hellip;</p>
<p>Simple : <br /><img title="Glass" src="http://www.journaldugeek.com/files/2013/02/glass-3-600x265.png" alt="Glass" /></p>
<p>Anyone worried about stylish sunglasses posting Here is on the wrong site</p>
<p>As a very fashion conscious and technology obsessed male I take offense to that.</p>
<p>well, maybe you should think of this tech as the fashion equivalent of being the &lsquo;y&rsquo; in y=x^2, waaaaay ahead &amp; above the fashion curve as opposed to &lsquo;y&rsquo; in y=x, just following what x does.</p>
<p>Well look at Rene fucking Descartes over here</p>
<p>thst&rsquo;s Heisenberg, to you&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t because who cares? These things are designed to be able to have lenses added to them or be attached to a different pair of glasses. There&rsquo;s your answer.</p>
<p>Exactly. They need to make a way to attach &lsquo;Glass&rsquo; to any glasses (not just sunglasses). I believe it can be done.</p>
<p>Fashion designer 3D glasses were made for people who complain 3D glasses are ugly. Something similar would be done for google Glass.</p>

<p>And what do you do when you want to wear some stylish sunglasses&hellip; And use Glass at the same time?</p>

<p>I guess the hipster in you dies a little.</p>
<p>You clip in your lenses see the gallery above.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t buy them?</p>

<p>Close enough&hellip;</p>
<p>It would be amazing if they made them look like this! With power level measuring and all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there will be an app for that!</p>
<p>If given all the data needed, I wonder how people would interpret power level in the real world. Some sort of combination between net worth and online followers? How weird would it be to walk down the road and see people as levels, like you would in an <span class="caps">MMO</span>?</p>
<p>This could be really useful for playing Ingress.</p>
<p>This reminds me of something out of Daemon by Daniel Suarez</p>
<p>Nah, it&rsquo;s just going to be made up bullshit. No sense in making a toy somebody&rsquo;s going to use for twenty minutes overly complex.</p>
<p>Klout?</p>
<p>I was just going to type that.</p>
<p>It would be amazing if they included an easter egg that triggered when you said &ldquo;Find their power level&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or the HUDs in  Daemon and Freedom ^TM!</p>
<p>They need to work an easter egg homage in!</p>
<p>Over 9000!!!!</p>
<p>only reason it isn&rsquo;t like this is because they have yet to find a way to make them stay on our head (unless someone plan to glue snap on their skin (brrr maybe not)</p>
<p>You guys haven&rsquo;t learned how to feel power level yet?</p>
<p>You guys haven&rsquo;t learned that power level&rsquo;s are useless yet?</p>
<p>I hope they do a study that monitors if using a computer 24/7 deteriorates brain functionality. They say that not remembering phone numbers (since cell phones allow you to save the number) has had major effects on memory. This could be even worse.</p>
<p>Actually its a very intersting discussion to have. What happens when most information is available within predefined context&rsquo;s at our fingertips and we come to rely on it heavily. Where does our brain focus on next? Humans possess the ability to make connections from seemingly unconnected things, we can figure out patterns very easily without prior training (or at least training which isn&rsquo;t apparently visible or overt)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny to think about that since its not like phone numbers are naturally occurring things. They only existed for about a century and there probably aren&rsquo;t too many other systems where massive numbers of the human population took part in what has become a global memorization experiment.</p>
<p>Plus for much of that time we had things like phone books and address books and day planners to keep everyone&rsquo;s contact number in anyway.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have an effect on memory itself, but on the need to store data. What they found is that if you don&rsquo;t need to remember it, you indeed don&rsquo;t remember it. That&rsquo;s hardly a deterioration.</p>
<p>Agreed.  I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;ve also gained a better ability to create appropriate queries and parse large amounts of information in order to quickly find what we need, which is potentially more useful (today) than rote memorization.</p>
<p>Ah yes, the old &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been telling stories for centuries why would we need this newfangled paper to write them down on?? why, that will deteriorate our memory!&rdquo; argument.</p>
<p>Wake up and smell the constant progress of technology. So you don&rsquo;t need to remember phone numbers &ndash; good! Now you can concentrate on more important things like remembering moments, faces, smells, sounds and feelings. And you know what, when you&rsquo;re getting old and grey and your memory is naturally deteriorating you&rsquo;ll be thankful that there are photographs and videos of some of those moments, and perhaps those will better by the virtue of something like google glass.</p>
<p>P.S. Who are &ldquo;they&rdquo; btw? I mean, have there been studies or something?</p>
<p>The memorization and use of a long string of numbers improves memory. It&rsquo;s like a small exercise for your brain.</p>
<p>Ah yes, we all remember the collective memory increase in everyone once phones were invented&hellip;</p>
<p>Not only was there a time before cellphones, there was a time before phones. Did the requirement of remembering phone numbers suddenly make people smarter for a short while and now that people don&rsquo;t have to anymore we are reverting to pre-cellphone days?</p>
<p>Remembering ten different fifteen-character passwords trumps phone numbers.</p>
<p>This has been happening since books were invented.</p>
<p>In some cultures you are still expected to memorise thousands of pages of text, and the brain is quite capable of doing that.</p>
<p>only a cool factor but pointless in the long run</p>
<p>new logo? <img src="http://i.imgur.com/JVvwXUE.png" /></p>
<p>I think so&hellip;and it looks goood</p>
<p>I read this as GL &ndash; <span class="caps">ASS</span>&hellip; :/</p>
<p>Agreed&hellip;they should flip the direction of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; to be |\.  It would create the gap between the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and the &ldquo;SS&rdquo; so even if you were to read it as two words, it&rsquo;d be the non-sensical &ldquo;<span class="caps">GLA</span> &ndash; SS&rdquo; and not &ldquo;GL &ndash; <span class="caps">ASS</span>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You mean you don&rsquo;t know about the <span class="caps">GLA</span> division of the SS?<br />
That&rsquo;s exactly how they styled their logo!</p>
<p>If some people see &ldquo;ass&rdquo; then I guarantee you, had it been inverted like you suggest some people would be seeing &ldquo;SS&rdquo; and there&rsquo;d be a whole lot more noise raised over that than just immature giggles over &ldquo;ass&rdquo;. :)</p>
<p>Oh Google.  Well, at least the demo looked great.  :)<br /><img title="" src="http://thebadkerningblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/keming.jpg?w=510" alt="" /></p>

<p>Google Now&hellip; IN <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">FACE</span>!</p>
<p>If only Google Now worked half decent enough in the UK &ndash; despite everything being turned on on my phone (location services, wifi, 3G &ndash; the whole caboodle) all I ever get is the weather and the odd piece of distance to destination info that&rsquo;s massively wrong.</p>
<p>How about anyone else in the UK?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the UK and I&rsquo;m getting a ton of great info from Google Now. I get weather, directions to places I&rsquo;ve searched, directions to appointments I&rsquo;ve made, reminders of times to leave for work based on the current traffic, travel time to home based on traffic, sports scores, distance I&rsquo;ve walked in a month etc. The only thing I don&rsquo;t get is public transportation info.</p>
<p>The fact that you&rsquo;re not getting anything useful from it is probably just down to how you use Google&rsquo;s services, not because you&rsquo;re in the UK.</p>
<p>Also from the UK, and I get bus times for where I am as well as everything you mentioned.</p>
<p>Works perfectly here. I get all sorts of suggestions and information. It gathers information from how you use Google search, as said above.</p>
<p>I live in London and get bus timings, cinemas, directions, photo spots, weather, reminders for appointments, walking distances for the past month, sport scores. I&rsquo;ve even had a reminder for a filght a couple days ago, and it gave me traffic and directions three hours in advance of my flight.</p>
<p>I think if you turn on your kit as-well, your caboodle will work perfectly&hellip; ;p</p>
<p>in the UK too, not great for me as I don&rsquo;t drive, they need to add walking/biking to it. All i get is weather and next lecture as a card. They need to add rugby to the sports as well, and national teams for football.</p>
<p>Actually, there are walking/biking directions too. just use the settings of the card to switch the transportation method.</p>
<p>Thanks, I hadn&rsquo;t seen it before, gotta check that now.</p>
<p>That sucks, mine gives weather, distance, photo spots, places of interest, Bus times etc. Maybe check your location history is on or something.</p>
<p>Yup &ndash; checked all of those. Have a gmail account, use Google Calendar with appointments, I don&rsquo;t drive but public transport is there, though it&rsquo;s usually wrong. Use Chrome browser &ndash; basically, many of their services. Only had it about three weeks with the <span class="caps">HTC</span> One X update but so far, it&rsquo;s been pretty pants. Oh &ndash; it gives me photo&rsquo;s based on location too and the same coffee shops whether I&rsquo;m near them or about a mile away from them.</p>
<p>So . . . dunno. =/</p>
<p>And so the beginning of our Borg future starts now.</p>
<p>Finally!</p>
<p>Well, you know what they say&hellip; <span class="caps">RESISTANCE</span> IS <span class="caps">FUTILE</span>! (Or is it &ldquo;useless&rdquo;? : P)</p>

<p>In case anyone else isn&rsquo;t familiar with the books/radio plays/tv miniseries/movie (or completely missed the : P making light of the fact that I was making a joke, with a reference that might obviously be missed by some), the Vogons have a habit of saying, &ldquo;Resistance is useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is amazing. If only it could integrate with Skype instead of Hangout. I&rsquo;d gladly get rid of the other conflicting services to use this.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft is closing off Skype, unlikely.</p>
<p>What do you mean closing it off? Aren&rsquo;t they trying to expand its use?</p>
<p>Closing off <span class="caps">MSN</span> Messenger in favour of Skype you mean&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been closed off.</p>
<p>Link?</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they just release an update to Skype on Android, and didn&rsquo;t Blackberry say they are launching BB10 with a Skype app?</p>
<p>Sure sounds like its a closed platform. Its on more devices than Google Hangouts.</p>
<p>Whats wrong with hangout and who said that is impossible?</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;ll be able to. If Google is looking for &ldquo;creative individuals&rdquo; it could support apps. My guess is that it will support apps.</p>
<p>It might be up to MS to make an app compatible with Google Glass, not the other way arround.</p>
<p>Based on Google&rsquo;s past and philosophy I believe that this won&rsquo;t be a closed platform so MS should just develop a Skype app for it.</p>
<p>Microsoft will probably release an app for this before they release one for their own OS.</p>
<p>Is MS working on something similar to this? <br />
I don&rsquo;t know, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know &ndash; I was just making a reference to their decision to update Skype for Android/iOS/OS X before updating their Windows/WP apps.</p>
<p>How would that even work?  I mean, yeah you could see the video feed on your end, but where would you put the camera facing you for the other person?  You&rsquo;d almost need a camera boom that swings out for video calls.  Which, I suppose wouldn&rsquo;t be that bad of a solution as long as the boom was well out of the way when not in use.</p>
<p>look in the mirror</p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;ll go ahead and wait for the version made by someone else, that will inevitably just be derided as a rip-off, that will provide all the same function, with a more open framework and not wholly reliant on Google to work. Oddly enough, I think Google will be the one with the extremely closed option on this tech sector, because they are going to leverage it for data collection more than anything.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s based on Android, I&rsquo;m fairly positive this will happen.</p>
<p>Game changer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still not getting it myself.  If I don&rsquo;t care about recording PoV video, and I know how to get around my town well enough not to require a constant <span class="caps">HUD</span>, what does glass really give me?</p>
<p>There are so many times where I miss a photo of my kids because of the extra step of removing the phone from my pocket.  Forget the screen, I just need a mic (to pick up my voice) and a camera (to record/take pictures).</p>
<p>Yea, the camera really seems to be the main &ldquo;killer feature&rdquo; they are promoting.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s the main proprietary feature besides google now, while they are leaving the rest of it open to developers to continue.  You&rsquo;ve watched the original video they showed for concepts right? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4</a>  &ndash; this is an actual functioning version of what it is doing right now.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>No, this is still conceptual stuff. It is certainly a more refined/realistic design/approach, but I don&rsquo;t believe any of this UI stuff is actually fully functional yet.</p>
<p>Are you sure about that?</p>
<p>The explorer edition is hitting a wider audience than just developers. Why wouldn&rsquo;t most of the UI be in place?  Much of what it&rsquo;s shown doing are already things they are capable of doing through google services (maps, goggles, plus, now, translate).</p>
<p>How about having the <span class="caps">GPS</span> always on your field of vision when you&rsquo;re in long trips?</p>

<p>So overused, yet so appropriate here&hellip;</p>
<p>Amazing. </p>
<p>Waaaaaaaaaaant ):</p>
<p>Well, it seems to be official:</p>
<p>Google has won technology.</p>
<p>Anyone can make a good looking mockup, shipping it will be the real test.</p>
<p>and what makes you think they won&rsquo;t be able to? So far everything seems to be going convincingly smooth and i hope it stays that way.</p>
<p>Google Glass will fail. If this is how it&rsquo;s going to be used then it will be more of a problem than a solution. No one will wear them the whole time and no matter how many &ldquo;mock-up&rdquo; videos they do if voice control isn&rsquo;t 99% accurate then it will fail even harder, and to be honest based on what I&rsquo;ve seen from every technology company, voice control is and will stay a gimmick or just have a supporting role for the next 3 to 5 years, just enough time to make Glass irrelevant.</p>
<p>Voice control sure won&#8217;t be the only way to control this. Google has already applied for patents on ring-type controllers, and Vic Gundotra even said there&#8217;s a horizontal touchpad on the right side of the frame. It was in an article on Engadget back from last Google IO.</p>
<p>Imagine a ring that you wear on your finger that is touch-sensitive, and has jog-wheel functionality when you run your thumb up/down it. And additionally, a controller that you wear as a wristwatch. Yum!</p>
<p>I seriously hope they do this.  It seems almost obvious (in retrospect).  It&rsquo;d be such a candid and easy way to navigate the UI as you go about your day.</p>
<p>Pairing this with a watch would add a whole new level of experience. For one, if the watch had a camera, it&rsquo;d solve the whole video chat problem where people actually want to see <em>you</em> and not necessarily <em>what you&rsquo;re doing</em>.</p>
<p>Plus, I could live out my spy fantasies I had as a kid.</p>
<p>Too bad no one wears watches anymore</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Spy fantasies indeed. Only that the spy won&rsquo;t be you.</p>

<p>Spy fantasies indeed. Only that the spy won&rsquo;t be you.</p>

<p>Awww, now why&rsquo;d you have to ruin all the fun? Party pooper!</p>
<p>The video demonstrated the touch pad. One of the balloon guys used it to scroll through his contacts when he sent a picture.</p>
<p>The voice recognition on Google Now is remarkably accurate already. I&rsquo;d say it has had 95% accuracy for me.</p>
<p>100% accuracy for things like &lsquo;Call name&rsquo;, &lsquo;Set alarm&rsquo; etc etc</p>
<p>I have to agree, Google&rsquo;s voice recognition is far superior to Siri &ndash; hence the reason why my next phone will be an android flagship. My iPhone 5 while well made and usually freeze-free, the voice recognition is absolutely terrible compared to my previous experience with Android 2.3.3 and even the Google Search App on the Appstore. All that comes from just having voice recognition on so many devices and using the amount of data they have to interpret what you are wanting in the correct way.</p>
<p>I use Google Search (voice) on my iPhone 4 frequently and am routinely amazed at its accuracy. I think a lot of has to do with Google being able to put the words into context, like saying Thai <em>food</em> knows I&rsquo;m saying Thai, not tie.</p>
<p>My experience is that their voice recognition is only on par with other solutions but the Google Search backend is remarkably brilliant with mangled queries. The biggest advantage it has over Siri (otherwise) is that it does on-the-fly transcription on the device and live search (whatever Google calls it) to provide a responsive interface.</p>
<p>It works quite well, but that&rsquo;s due more to Google&rsquo;s ability to handle fuzzy queries than to the accuracy of the transcription.</p>
<p>it is on par.</p>
<p>Yet their voice transcription of voicemails is laughably bad. I&rsquo;ve never had a voicemail be close to 100% accurate when reading it in text, usually less than 50%.</p>
<p>Usually because the range of audio capture devices being used to record those voicemails goes from acceptable to horrible.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t understand your comment. Aren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;audio capture devices&rdquo; just the same mics on cell phones that we use for Google Now? How can they be good enough for one voice transcription (I never type that word right on the first try) service, but not another?</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t transcribe the voicemail from the caller&rsquo;s mic, they do it from the signal that&rsquo;s already been compressed and transmitted to your voicemail.</p>
<p>Thank you, that makes perfect sense but I had never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>Imagine Google Glass controlled by a smartwatch.<br />
There you go, problem solved.</p>
<p>I think that would be redundant, actually.</p>
<p>Maybe, but I&rsquo;d argue that that&rsquo;s a good thing. That way it can be used in silent mode, and it&rsquo;s easier to navigate through menus if you have a second touchscreen display on your wrist. I&rsquo;m certainly interested in both, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Why do you need a screen on your wrist when you have one on your face?</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t touch your face to click on something.</p>
<p>ya.. but we don&rsquo;t hold our mouses to the computer screen for clicking purposes, do we.. I mean you?</p>
<p>Yes, because no technology ever gets better with iteration and time.  This is the final version of Google Glass and it will never improve. /s</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d get Glass just for the photos alone. My girlfriend is very camera shy, but she has such a beautiful smile. I&rsquo;ll be using them to get candid shots of her while she&rsquo;s smiling/laughing.</p>
<p>Then you add in the fact that it&rsquo;s a whole new platform that can do so many things, and <span class="caps">OMG</span> I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>She might not become less camera shy with you muttering &ldquo;Take a picture&rdquo; out loud every time you want to do it&hellip;&hellip;.=p</p>
<p>ha, that&rsquo;s a pretty funny image.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you need to say anything to take a picture.  When they are in the hot air balloon in the video, she pinches her fingers together to take a picture.</p>
<p>Was just joshing.</p>
<p>She might not be your girlfriend much longer if you&rsquo;re always threatening to take her picture.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had TellMe miss a voice command yet, and its at about 90% correct when I dictate a text message these days.</p>
<p>Microsoft had that tech demo with a live transcription going on in the background, and I believe it was around 99% accurate.</p>
<p>Sync in my car has been pretty accurate. There&rsquo;s been a number of times where its populated a list and asked me to choose an item because it didn&rsquo;t hear me perfectly, but normally what I said is listed as #1 or #2.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, Google Now works pretty well.</p>
<p>By the time these things launch, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if voice tech gets even farther along.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be wearing mine practically all the time, except in the shower.  But that&rsquo;s just me&hellip;</p>
<p>Well they can airplay or sync it to your android phone or app so you could use your phone to control the glasses I you want. Well at least I hope they would implement this.</p>
<p>indeed ! i think Google is one of just a handful of big tech companies that can still churn out new and innovative products !</p>
<p>Make it as a contact lens and i&rsquo;m in. I&rsquo;m not gonna wear those ugly glasses.</p>
<p>You aren&#8217;t wearing ugly glasses. You&#8217;re wearing a small cube sitting above your eye. Contact lenses have the problem in many people just can&#8217;t wear them :(</p>
<p>Plus, at the moment you would probably end up having to connect the lens by wire to the battery and processing section which I think would be far worse than wearing glasses.</p>
<p>But one day, once the transparent computer is more than just a trade show concept, they may be able to shrink it to the size of a contact.</p>
<p>There was something about how contact lenses were too close to the eye to focus.on.</p>
<p>I think even Glass is too close to focus on, try reading something pressed up to our glasses. The device itself will be responsible for focussing the light so you can see it at such a close distance. I wonder how resistant that will be to movement, since it would be a shame if it went blurry if it moved about slightly.</p>
<p>They can project something that has a focus in the distance. That&rsquo;s how the hud in a fighter plane works.</p>
<p>Actually Project Glass doesn&rsquo;t even use a traditional display as far as i know. It uses a retinal project and literally projects a image on your retina. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_retinal_display" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_retinal_display</a></p>
<p>Looking at the picture, it&rsquo;s a bit more than just a small cube above your eye&hellip;</p>
<p>well, its a small cube above your eye, plus the clip that attaches it to one of the&hellip;..whatever that part of a pair of glasses is called, that go back over your ear.  From what I can tell you can use this with any pair of prescription or sunglasses you have.  The &lsquo;stock&rsquo; glasses that are often shown are likely just dev glasses, as many on the team probably don&rsquo;t wear glasses normally.</p>
<p>See you in a decade or two</p>
<p>not so long imho<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>no way. not interested in contact lenses at all.</p>
<p><img title="They're not ugly." src="http://images2.fanpop.com/image/quiz/423000/423398_1275830673348_397_300.jpg" alt="They're not ugly." /></p>
<p>All of a sudden I want Tuvok/Seven slash fic.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re a prototype; as in, that&rsquo;s not what the finished product is going to look like, silly person. They&rsquo;ve already mentioned designer options in the works. Not to mention when Apple releases their iMonocle/EyePhone, and everyone starts making slick looking ones.</p>
<p>Awesome, that&rsquo;s it for now.</p>
<p>OH MY <span class="caps">GOD</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span> IS SO <span class="caps">AWESOME</span> dafdadasfdsaadADFADAfafdad</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you but I&rsquo;m not a trapeze artist, sky-diver, acrobat pilot, fire juggler or hot air balloonist. I wonder if Google will make a video with the goggles of somebody going to work and then out for beers with a friend, and then for a poop at home.</p>
<p>Navigation, camera, etc :) I guess voice translation wont come in helpful when you&rsquo;re on the toilet.</p>
<p>Except the video also adds a few dull average people as well.</p>
<p>Watching porn at work, you mean..</p>
<p>Watching porn?  With all that video shooting via Google Glass people are going to be making first-person porn.   You could even have live Google hangout porn group sex.  Hands-free video shooting is going to revolutionize the amateur porn and revenge porn industries.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why the sarcasm tag.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that Google+ &ldquo;hangouts&rdquo; won&rsquo;t become synonymous with group sex video sharing.  Hence the sarcasm tag.</p>
<p>The rest of what I said would like result with the hands-free video of Google Glass.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know tat Google Glass will be synonymous with group sex, but you <strong>know</strong> some people will definitely use it for some sultry home videos.</p>
<p>I know I will.</p>
<p>That in a way is kinda awesome aha. My girl would make me take mine off when in bed though.</p>
<p>haha. not mine. i win.</p>
<p>That Nav when the guy is on the bike or skii&rsquo;s is exactly why I want one.</p>
<p>Poop mass:  250g</p>
<p>i like skydiving and skiing/snowboarding. this looked awesome to me.</p>
<p>I know right? No real person celebrates birthdays or eats Thai food.</p>
<p>The video reminds me how my life is boring and uninteresting. :(</p>
<p>That is a lot of wow. But it does take some getting used to. I can&rsquo;t focus on both at the same time.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t chew gum and walk at the same time ?</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t</p>
<p>was it just me, or did that bike messenger part look super dangerous.</p>
<p>bike messenger is a dangerous profession&hellip;</p>
<p>see premium rush for a documentary.</p>
<p>Yes and with the Glass you&rsquo;re even more aware of it now.</p>
<p>Damn, that is something I believe I want. No, <span class="caps">NEED</span>!</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s message to everyone else in consumer tech; &#8220;your move.&#8221;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;ll be a long time before someone else comes close.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s gonna have to be a company with search and maps and infrastructure tie-ins. that list of companies is super short.</p>
<p>With that brief pop-up of Google Now, it all makes sense. It is expanding on the phone, but I bet that it was designed with Glass in mind. You never have to prompt Google Now, and it just offers up information about what is going on around you. I always thought it was strange that in order to see a lot of it, you have to go into now, but with Glass, it will always be in your periphery. It makes complete sense why Now works the way it does. I&rsquo;m very intrigued. I bet that that is how Google will deliver the augmented reality, ambient information portion of its headset.</p>
<p>Wait until it gets to desktop with Chrome.</p>
<p>Wait until it gets to a watch!</p>
<p>The video has some cool ideas for glance&rsquo;able info, like the Google Now pop-ups, but I would prefer most of this on my wrist, rather than my face.  This type of stuff in a watch seems like it would make info more accessible, but less intrusive at the same time.</p>
<p>Lets skip the watch and put it in front of the eye :P</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s skip the eye and beam it directly to the brain.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s skip the brain and attach it to our genitals.</p>
<p>nah. glasses. absolutely.</p>
<p>Nice observation. Is interesting to see this in parallel with Siri and the recent iWatch speculation. Looks like google and apple are taking two completely different approaches, google with automatic surfacing of data and apple with data on demand.</p>
<p>The google approach seems the more invasive since its in your periphery all the time whereas the iWatch/Siri concept isn&#8217;t so invasive, you use it when you want. Ill be interested to see which becomes more dominant or whether they coexist for different purposes.</p>
<p>I think Google now would work just as well on a watch. They just need to design some great hardware and off you go. The other way around will be much harder for apple.</p>
<p>I would much rather have this technology on a watch. It would probably be a lot more successful.</p>
<p>Google already has <span class="caps">NOW</span>.  Samsung just needs to make an Android watch with their flexible display, done and done.</p>
<p>This is actually kind of lame. I was hoping for an augmented reality type UI integrated with maps etc. that gave me contextual information when I looked at things (and asked for info), not just a widget that tells me the weather or lets me video chat while I play with the dog.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re looking for something more Jarvis-like, Iron Man?</p>
<p>Um, didn&rsquo;t you see the person cycling through, what looked like <span class="caps">NYC</span>? Or the person skiing with maps?</p>
<p>Side note &ndash; I&rsquo;m currently skiing in France and I would love something like that to use as a route guide / planner.</p>
<p>No one has said thats impossible yet :) There is so much we still don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Yeah, and where&rsquo;s the heat vision or X-ray vision? If glasses can&rsquo;t do at least that, why would I even consider wearing them?</p>
<p>One step at a time man.. Damn.</p>
<p>In the context, the comment is hilarious because this is a leap forward in mobile and personal devices. We&rsquo;re witnessing the dawn of a new category in mobile devices, and then reading that&hellip; Haha.</p>
<p>My point was not that this isn&rsquo;t cool, or something I want, but that to call this a leap forward is being a bit generous. Look at what this thing actually is: a projection of a pared-down smartphone UI onto the top corner of the glasses. In that sense, it isn&rsquo;t anything new, just a repackaging of what I have in my pocket. Yes, I think it&rsquo;s useful to have a map that I can see while skiing, but what does this actually do differently from Google maps on a phone? It would be a better use of the fact the glasses are over my eyes to overlay that map on what I am seeing. The difference is precisely my having to look at the map and match it to what I am seeing versus the software taking advantage of being on my face and doing that matching for me. <em>That</em> would be far more exciting, and far more progressive.</p>
<p>Exactly. The tech is a cool idea, but nowhere close to being practical for 99% of people. Right now it essentially allows you to use your smartphone without using your hands. So cool GoPro style videos, instant Google searches, and constant weather information&hellip;which is really useful when you are already standing outside&hellip;</p>
<p>I like the idea, but it will take a lot more functionality before I give up a percentage of my visual field all the time.</p>
<p>U won&#8217;t its a see through glass the images is laid on the glass. It&#8217;ll deff. impaired a lil it shouldn&#8217;t be enough to bother or block completely</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not practical because it doesn&rsquo;t do eveything you expected it to do? You don&rsquo;t see the convenience of being able to do all those things hands free?</p>
<p>It is innovation just as the iPhone was. No tech is built from the ground up now that there is a set foundation. Google is taking what we do now and presenting it in a new way.</p>
<p>This is why people suck. Google gives us the first mainstream attempt of making integrated AR a part of our lives and you go &#8220;well I expected more&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll do exactly what you&#8217;re asking for, but Google has been extremely clear that its initially going to have limited functionality, and that they&#8217;re focusing on ease of use.</p>
<p>People will never cease to amaze me.</p>
<p>Totally spoiled living in the future, eh?</p>
<p>Yeah. I prefer to be constantly in awe of the fact that I have a magic box in my pocket that holds most knowledge and can do pretty much anything.</p>
<p>And this is a much smaller box ;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in the future and we let it pass us by.&rdquo;<br />
- T.E. Clarke</p>
<p>To be fair, I think many people want more because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_DsUl_vqvo">this</a> is what Google originally showed Glass as; AR views based on what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>
<p>Which was a mockup that they said was a mockup. Complaining that a beta isn&#8217;t fully featured is pointless.</p>
<p>I agree and please don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m complaining; I would love to own a Glass!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not that different.</p>
<p>These &#8216;people&#8217; I tend to shuffle under the &#8216;late majority&#8217; when it comes to the graph of diffusion of innovation.</p>
<p>wow. so you&rsquo;re that guy, hunh?</p>
<p>this was amazing.</p>
<p>Google Now is almost like that.  It&rsquo;ll pull up directions and information and such when it thinks you need it, and especially if you ask for it.</p>
<p>As far as describing things, taking a picture and using it as a Google Image Search woud be a big plus.</p>
<p>Wow this is the technology of future and 4 years from now it&rsquo;ll be mainstream.  However, I think user inteface can be better.</p>
<p>Welcome to More-Accidents World where distraction is all the hype.</p>
<p>Yes, no one is using their precious pocket devices all the time while driving/doing stuff nowadays.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>The precious pocket devices are kept usually in pockets and taken out when needed, unlike Google Glass with all the time distraction right in your eyes.<br />
Not that using mobile phones while driving/doing stuff is any good.</p>
<p>Hands free context aware info would be far less distracting than what happens currently. Plus this is just the start&hellip;</p>
<p>After all:<br />
Developers, developers, developers.</p>
<p>Well, you could always put your G-Glasses in your pocket when you&rsquo;re not using it :D&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everything they showed in that video was transparent. If I&rsquo;m driving and I could see a text pop up in the corner of my eye that would take me one or two seconds to read, wouldn&rsquo;t that be safer than someone pulling out their phone while driving?</p>
<p>And this is worse than people constantly looking down to use their phones whilst out walking busy roads?!? :/</p>
<p>Of course it is even worse! You would wear those glasses all the time, for most of the day. You can&rsquo;t really believe that people reading texts, googling or video-calling can focus enough on walking or driving without causing any accident, can you?</p>
<p>Your point above was how this is going to cause more accidents. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s going to cause the same amount or less, because there are no hands involved. And the obvious ignore feature of focusing on something else is still present.</p>
<p>I disagree. Mainly because the demographic for this device is currently different than the majority of people who are texting while driving&hellip;so it means more people on the road who will be distracted. Teenagers who just had their parents buy them their huge <span class="caps">SUV</span> still on their phones and a bunch of techies with Glass constantly on their face.</p>
<p>You are not using your hands, but say you get a message: boom, instant change in the top right of your visual field, so you look. It only takes a few seconds to cause an accident in a hunk of metal that weighs a ton moving at 70mph. With a phone in your pocket you have the choice to leave it alone&hellip;the same choice is much harder with instinctual eye movements.</p>
<p>Really? Your eyes are going to move ever so slightly to the right, if at all, and it&rsquo;s going to kill you? How long does it take for you to read a text that says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home at 7.&rdquo; Half a second, tops? Then you continue driving. You use your peripherals while driving, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You use your peripherals while driving, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This. There are different kinds of people and for some just driving is challenging enough, while others can do various tasks at it. Hell, some even never will be able to drive stick.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HUD</span> displays have always been about making information glance able to avoid the dangers of distraction.  The fact that is voice operated. Take picture, show map, navigate etc, means less time spent glancing at non heads up information. Play Ween etc,. your hands dont leave the wheel.   <br />
One critical use they didn&rsquo;t show was a navigation overlay. Say you are driving in the dark or heavy fog, to overlay the roads/turns real time location is significant in the way radar helps a jet pilot.</p>
<p>How do you change the radio while you are driving? How do you see how much gas you have left?  How do you know what speed you are travelling at? Using a <span class="caps">GPS</span> you look away at a map. <span class="caps">HUD</span> gives you less distraction to do these things while driving. If you think looking down at your speedometer is safer than an <span class="caps">HUD</span> of your real time speed, I have to say I completely disagree.</p>
<p>The last paragraph nails it&hellip;thousands of people already use <span class="caps">GPS</span> when driving, yet this requires even less of a shift of focus.</p>
<p>Self-driving cars are already in the works. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way. Any time I see someone texting while driving, it is almost always a 30-40 year old adult, not a teenager. I get its the stereotype, but at least in my area, it&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t get a message in front of your face, but outside your main focus, which (I hope so) is the road. I bet it takes a while to adjust too, but so does driving a vehicle.</p>
<p>How about this, you tell your glasses that you are going into driving mode.  In that mode, the glasses talk to you instead of popping up a message.  Then you just simply listen to texts as they come in and send them using your voice.</p>
<p>Why do you think they&rsquo;re coming out with self-driving cars? Problem solved.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why &ndash; for driver distractions, at least &ndash; Google is working on the Autonomous Car, too!</p>
<p>good thing we won&rsquo;t be driving anymore.</p>
<p>Careful, he might go off on a rant about self-driving cars.</p>
<p>Then he&rsquo;ll segue into &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe people don&rsquo;t make their own bread anymore&hellip; things were so much better before technology came around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, trying to get a good crust from a bread-maker is next to impossible, so yeah, bread is much better the old fashioned way. :)</p>
<p>this looks pretty amazing.</p>
<p>i still get creeped out by the fact that anybody could be filming me at any time just by looking at me.</p>
<p>I would guess there would be an <span class="caps">LED</span> on the front, similar to the FaceTime cams on Macbooks.</p>
<p>and you don&rsquo;t need to wait for Glass to do that, it can already be happening&hellip; think about it.</p>
<p>i would guess there would be an easy tweak to turn this <span class="caps">LED</span> off shortly after release</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s called electrical tape.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://images01.olx.in/ui/11/42/93/1340519692_404333993_3-High-Quality-Pen-Camera-Camcorder-USB-Video-Recordr-DVR-Electronics.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>These things are available everywhere ..</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pen, find me a good Italian restaurant. &hellip;Pen?&hellip; Pen&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>i do believe there&rsquo;s a difference whether someone spends money to buy a little spycam toy or whether there&rsquo;s a widely accepted consumer electronics device that&rsquo;s constantly pointed at everything you look.</p>
<p>if someone wants to use that weird pen-cam, be my guest, but if everyone who uses a smartphone now started using google glass, there&rsquo;d be cameras pointed at you, constantly.</p>
<p>sorry. creeps me out. ;)</p>
<p>It is creepy, but you are narcissistic if you think everyone with a camera is suddenly going to be recording you. Have you ever noticed the amount of cameras recording you in every store, on public streets, in parks at stop lights?</p>
<p>yes, and it worries me, too. but these are intended (at least officially) for my security. (and you are being noticed that a certain area is under video surveillance)<br />
imagine the levels of bullying this kind of technology can bring with it. the guy being picked on is under constant surveillance and he might not even know he is. <strong>some</strong> camera&rsquo;s always on.</p>
<p>this already happens with smartphones, but i do believe, taking out your smartphone and pointing it at a person is something far more visible than whispering &ldquo;ok glass, film this&rdquo; or even just touching the rim of your smartglasses.</p>
<p>i do not like the thought of every curious onlooker automatically becoming a cameraman without having to feel &lsquo;embarassed&rsquo; for pointing his viewfinder at something.</p>
<p>this can be a good thing (as in documenting wrongdoings of any kind) but also a bad one.</p>
<p>the technology looks amazing, but i do worry about personality rights. you can&rsquo;t appeal to your personality rights and your rights of not having footage taken of you if you don&rsquo;t even notice someone&rsquo;s filming you.</p>
<p>being notified* &hellip;</p>
<p>you know, if you get robbed the next time, you would totally have a picture of the mugger, or if not his/her physical features (height, etc) to give to the police. It&rsquo;s not unlike the car cameras that recorded, amongst evidence of car accidents.. a meteorite that exploded with the power of 30 hiroshima bombs.</p>
<p>At least with Glass, you know there&rsquo;s the possibility that the wearer could be recording you, so you can take precautions. But anyone trying to record your actions for nefarious purposes won&rsquo;t be using such a conspicuous device. So you should in fact be more afraid of disguised cameras such as this rather than Glass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least with Glass, you know there&rsquo;s the possibility that the wearer could be recording you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that&rsquo;s exactly my point.</p>
<p>imagine, in 10 years, everyone wearing one of those things. there&rsquo;s <strong>always</strong> the possibility of the wearer recording me.<br />
i&rsquo;m not saying they are. but they could be.<br />
and that&rsquo;s what creeps me out.</p>
<p>I prefer not to live my life in paranoia of the fact that <strong>anyone could be recording your life at this very moment.</strong> It&rsquo;s already unavoidable. Unless you decide to forgo the convenience of modern life to become a hermit&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree. I don&rsquo;t really want a world where Google is constantly mapping everyone and I&rsquo;m being filmed constantly. I guess the right thing to do if you absolutely don&rsquo;t want to be filmed is to avoid talking to people wearing these things.</p>
<p>Covert filming devices have been in the market for ages, these aren&rsquo;t covert in comparison to someone secretly filming you either up close with one of those devices or further away with a phone or something.</p>
<p>not wanting to be filmed means you&rsquo;re likely going to need to stay home.</p>
<p>or wait until I invent a device that you carry on your person that prevents your image from being captured by any modern digital camera device.</p>
<p>If this becomes a mass market product you&rsquo;ll have to expect to be filmed all the time. Think about it. Time to brush up your style!</p>
<p>Yep I would refuse to talk to people wearing this.</p>
<p>At least at first&hellip;</p>
<p>we&rsquo;re gonna see duck lips all the time now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that was made up of video taken from Glass.<br />
I was hoping to see someone look into the mirror to prove that this was all being recorded by Glass/</p>
<p>They probably filmed it all with a van full of expensive camera equipment.<br />
:P</p>
<p>Because last year&rsquo;s jumping out of a plane to land on stage at Google I/O all <span class="caps">LIVE</span> just wasn&rsquo;t real enough? And in the time that&rsquo;s passed since then&hellip;. :/</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a video on Youtube showing it really is Glass (: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Pjl31cyDY" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Pjl31cyDY</a></p>
<p>Google is doing awesome things with Glass, but I dunno&hellip; and Google Now is really cool. I&rsquo;m just not sure I&rsquo;d want to stick that thing in front of my face.</p>
<p><img title="That's what she said!" src="http://devotions4misfits.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/michael-scott.jpg" alt="That's what she said!" /></p>
<p>Has Google become the new vaporware-amazing-conceptual-video-maker-but-never-really-making-a-real-good-product-Microsoft?</p>
<p>I hope not, I really like the video, but I&rsquo;m getting a bad vibe of dej&aacute;-vu.</p>
<p>Well considering this advert is based around a campaign to supply them to &ldquo;creative&rdquo; people. Id guess not.</p>
<p>I dont think you know what vaporware means.</p>
<p>This is an actual existing product thats finished and for sale, or will be soon. It exists. Its not &ldquo;vapor&rdquo; anything.</p>
<p>Shhh, I&#8217;ve said that before and have been crankily told that now apparently vapourware is literally any product ever that hasn&#8217;t been released yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s basically the tech geek version of Irony, it can mean more or less whatever they want it to.</p>
<p>Pretty sure vaporware was coined to describe Microsoft Windows (which uh, obviously existed in some form at the time). It&rsquo;s yourself that&rsquo;s redefining the term.</p>
<p>Nah, Duke Nukem 4ever was the mother of all vaporware!</p>
<p>Which, of course, existed and eventually shipped.</p>
<p>I think he&rsquo;s coming from a promised set of features for a product and yet we&rsquo;ve not seen any real testing on video point of view. Everyone who currently owns one is under a <span class="caps">NDA</span>. So it might not live up to the standard that&rsquo;s being presented in the videos &ndash; or it could.</p>
<p>But yeah I agree, the product is out there so it&rsquo;s real to an extent.</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.</p>
<p>While the product may be [almost] ready, its commercials misleads us the same way other conceptual-rendered-useless gadgets do. I want Google to be real. You&rsquo;ll not be able to use the glasses during skydiving, what the hell! They&rsquo;ll be unusable in 99.9% of the situations in the video clip or just simply on a averagely noisy street.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;ll not be able to use the glasses during skydiving, what the hell!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But&hellip;they just&hellip;did&hellip;last year&hellip;</p>
<p>Watching that video, I kept expecting it to turn into a trailer for a cyber-thriller.</p>
<p><strong>Here you go Hollywood:</strong> Family-man&rsquo;s wife is kidnapped and he can see her being tortured through his Google Glass. Can Google make sense of the clues to help find her in time?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already 1000% better than <em>The Internship</em>.</p>
<p>Now Hollywood could do a competitor to &lsquo;Taken&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;Taken 2&rsquo;. &ldquo;I have a special kind of Google Glass, which I have developed over a number of years&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, but I will Google you, and I will kill you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>strange days.</p>
<p>Shit I jumped out of my seat when that snake came on!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited for this. Being Google, it will be fairly priced once available. I want it <span class="caps">NOW</span>! Lol.</p>
<p>Like the Nexus Q?</p>
<p>The Nexus Q was fairly priced for what it offered.  It&rsquo;s just that most consumers wouldn&rsquo;t want the totality of what it offered (e.g. the integrated amp).</p>
<p>no.</p>
<p>Show me another digital media streamer that can handle 1080p video over hdmi and support standalone audio playback with an integrated amp for less than $300.</p>
<p>The Sonos <span class="caps">CONNECT</span>:<span class="caps">AMP</span> does less (albeit with a better amp) and costs $500.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WANT</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">NEED</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok Glass&rdquo; is a brilliant way to start a voice command. Makes it feel much more natural, while inviting a command as input rather than some monologue.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, voice control in public makes people feel uneasy.  If you speak a command and it fails, you have to repeat it, which makes you look a little silly.</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>I wonder, what happens when there&rsquo;s more than one glass in the room?</p>
<p>Voice commands on the old Mac OS (early-mid 90s) worked similarly. It&rsquo;s the best way for an always-on voice system as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Nice, except I&rsquo;m not going to wear that ugly thing on my head, no matter how cool its features are.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s beautiful. I&rsquo;ll be wearing it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get one then. Absolutely no one will care.</p>
<p>Call me a luddite, but in most of those situations I&rsquo;d prefer to have no interactions/interruptions from technology so I can just soak up the experience. And the <span class="caps">GPS</span> while riding a bike looked kinda dangerous. Are they going to introduce laws similar to mobile phone ones stopping us from using augmented reality glasses while driving?</p>
<p>Also, &ldquo;Okay glass, take a photo&rdquo;. Is there a quicker way to take photos? Because saying that over and over will get pretty old pretty quickly, as opposed to a button which doesn&rsquo;t take 2 seconds to press.</p>
<p>You can use a handsfree BT device to operate your calls already, same dangerous level if you&rsquo;re weak minded.</p>
<p>It has a button, but obviously people where doing stuff in that video, which makes the speech command more powerful and natural.</p>
<p>Oh dear, weak minded?</p>
<p>What is the most important sense while driving? Your eyes. I don&rsquo;t know about you, but my human eyes can only focus at one distance at a time, meaning something 1 inch from your face makes everything else blurred out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not actually focusing on the lens in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a test. take your favorite pair of sunglasses and try focusing on the actual inner surface of the lens.</p>
<p>post back here and let me know how it works out.</p>
<p>And I can see not wearing them while driving &ndash; that&rsquo;s the same as no phones.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s one of those things you have to try and see how people react to it. I don&rsquo;t see how having a <span class="caps">GPS</span> already in your field of vision is any more dangerous than looking down at the <span class="caps">GPS</span> in your handlebar.</p>
<p>As for the camera, factor in the time it takes for a smartphone user to find his phone, turn it on and press the camera button (if one is available).</p>
<p>quicker way to take a photo?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay glass, record video.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I already wear glasses, so this is a must when it&rsquo;s released.</p>
<p>I want it, even though my life isn&rsquo;t as exciting as most of these tv couples.</p>
<p>Yes &hellip; I want one! Would be a welcome device to use whilst out riding my motorcycle instead of a go pro cam.</p>
<p>perhaps it can record your last will, too!</p>
<p>Awesome</p>
<p>Please shut up and take my money <span class="caps">NOW</span> . I want it . I want it !!!</p>

<p>with google glass amateur po_rn will not be the same</p>
<p>Google comes closer and closer to you. This is really going to be super awesome. Or super creepy. Let&rsquo;s find out!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that Tim Cook&rsquo;s leadership will be tested. Hard. Baton-in-the-ass-hard.</p>
<p>I currently own and enjoy an iPhone and MacBook Pro, making me an exclusive Apple user at home, but oh boy, this is what could change that in a single product. Combine Glass with the more rapid and innovative development of Android lately and Google is truly starting to look like a winner, with Apple taking a more conservative BlackBerry-ish role in comparison.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buy a google glass device just to mess around with when it first comes out. Google like you said is really doing some fun and exciting stuff recently.</p>
<p>Why must we always bring up apple. We don&#8217;t know if Apple is testing out something like this right now. Apple has a habit of not showing stuff 2 years before they bring it out. This is neat, but doesn&#8217;t mean only google is testing it out</p>
<p>I for one am grateful google likes to show off there stuff early, makes things super exciting. Although i understand your point.</p>
<p>Google showing off Glass as early as they did was a totally calculated move to stave off future litigation.  It&rsquo;s exactly what they needed to do.</p>
<p>Sure but we still get to benefit from all the excitement. Kind of like the leaks for &lsquo;google pixel&rsquo; if they&rsquo;re real and the chrome OS notifcation center.</p>
<p>They could just, you know, patent it. Apple&rsquo;s got some <span class="caps">HMD</span>/wearable patents.</p>
<p>All things considered, it&rsquo;s a valid choice to hype products like this. The early announcement is all about hype, don&rsquo;t try to rationalize otherwise. If it weren&rsquo;t, they would have announced it when developers could get their hands, not put on spectacles featuring sky diving and fashion shows or guerilla marketing by &ldquo;testing&rdquo; these things on public transit.</p>
<p>Likely true (I&rsquo;ve heard so much a couple of months ago). The reason why Apple is brought up is because they&rsquo;ve been the ones everyone looks up to deliver this kind of product. In this case (assuming the rumors are true), they&rsquo;d be following Google.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone reasonable looks to apple to deliver this kind of data intensive product. they are not that kind of company.</p>
<p>Like a smartphone is not &ldquo;data intensive&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>^^not an intelligent response.</p>
<p>pretty sure apple is not testing something like this.</p>
<p>^^not an intelligent response.</p>
<p>They definitely have, they&rsquo;ve got patents on similar technology.</p>
<p>Who said Apple will not releasing something better this summer?</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Easy way to tell. They don&rsquo;t have the ancillary services that would make this viable. This is where Google is the <span class="caps">WAY</span> better company for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Google is generating all of this data as a consequence of their search and ancillary properties. Apple has NO search. So in order for apple to build something like this, they&rsquo;d need an acquisition &ndash; a <span class="caps">HUGE</span> acquisition. So there&rsquo;d be no way to really keep this quiet.</p>
<p>Otherwise they&rsquo;d need a partner who would have them by the balls.<br />
 <br />
I&rsquo;ll wager Apple has nothing close to this in the works.</p>
<p>Apple actually has a lot of access to similar information as Google. That&rsquo;s not to say that Google doesn&rsquo;t have the lead in &ldquo;ancillary services&rdquo; but like Apple with the iPhone, being the leader also makes them the target. They definitely don&rsquo;t need a web search engine to provide a competitive product.</p>
<p>They might be releasing something like this. But not this summer. Nor the next.</p>
<p>You are in the vast minority if you are an &lsquo;exclusive anything&rsquo; user, and therefore not representative of some sort of imagined sea-change.</p>
<p>In what way will you be left behind working on a MacBooks Pro, while using Google Glasses?</p>
<p>Kinda lame. It seems that if you&rsquo;re not recording tons of video there&rsquo;s hardly any point. If I want to google something im going to use my phone or a computer.</p>
<p>You see no point in taking pictures?<br />
You see no point in hands-free navigation?<br />
You see no point in instant translation?</p>
<p>not to mention instant google goggles search.</p>
<p>Can I combine two sets of glasses? One for my employer and one for Google, I mean&hellip; me. The more multitasking the better!</p>
<p>You know when Nokia was called out for using a professional video camera instead of the Lumia 920? Think this pretty much applies here &ndash; unless it has unbelievable image stabilisation.</p>
<p>But you know, I can tell when the video is just to demonstrate what its capabilities are, and its capabilities are pretty amazing, but I&rsquo;m one of those people who still find talking into bluetooth while walking a bit weird.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Good point.</p>
<p>Actually, just realised that isn&rsquo;t a good point. I assume the main image was supposed to represent the user&rsquo;s eye view, not anything video recording quality.</p>
<p>The video&rsquo;s description says that everything was filmed with Google Glass. Take that for what you will.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d feel more comfortable with this if it wasn&rsquo;t all Google. Ideally I&rsquo;d want it to a completely open platform from a company with no vested interested in other parts of my life.</p>
<p>The problem is that a lot of the functions of Glass are made possible by the huge amount of quality services Google has available. Take for example translation. If this product was made by any other company, the development costs of coming up with a voice recognition and translation service on par with Google would be very high. They&rsquo;d probably come up with something similar, but not as good as what we expect from this device.</p>
<p>under those circumstances this would not exist.</p>
<p>One tiny step towards the real deal, the neuro linker.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s humanly possible for me to be less interested in this idea of computer-glasses.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a hater.</p>
<p>You are spot-on. This guy is (in)famous for being a Google hater.</p>
<p>Wahhhhhh.</p>
<p>I live in the first world, am obviously middle class or above, literate, and have some grasp of technology and the future of our world &ndash; a new product has arisen and I don&rsquo;t like it because my tribal instincts tell me to hate that team!</p>
<p>Wahhhhh</p>
<p>I am skeptical that Google Glasses will be a success, but anyone reading this site who isn&rsquo;t very interested to see how this develops has a seriously underdeveloped imagination.</p>
<p>Looks just awesome!!</p>
<p>I hope glass can tell when I am speaking and not take voice commands from other people around me.</p>
<p>Bone conduct technology.</p>
<p>Gimme <span class="caps">NOW</span>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</p>
<p>Their advertising images makes it seem like the display in the middle of the action, but the real video reveals that it&rsquo;s actually just a small display on the top right edge of your vision. Very misleading.</p>
<p>Also not sure how I feel about talking to my glasses. Maybe a step too far. We&rsquo;ll have to wait to see how that works.</p>
<p>Initial images were just to show the concept. I don&rsquo;t think they were trying to convince anyone that the camera is centered (otherwise, why release the video?).</p>
<p>Awesome. That&rsquo;s how memories will be recorded in the future (1+ years from now, that is).</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s video so that&rsquo;s pretty much how memories are already recorded&hellip; but with a lot more flexibility as the camera isn&rsquo;t usually attached to your face :/</p>
<p>Still not interested in a head mounted camera, or using a voice interface in public.</p>
<p>I hope they&rsquo;ll add motion/gesture control, subvocalization recognition, and more emphasis on augmented reality.</p>
<p>^this.</p>
<p>If you look at the part of the video where they are on the balloon, the user pinches her fingers to take a picture.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t want a pair then you&rsquo;re a loser.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty cool. The video highlights some practical uses for it. I found it far more interesting than the original concept video (as is usually the case).</p>
<p>Saying &lsquo;OK, Glass&rsquo; needs to change.</p>
<p>Yep, Google just won the Internet.</p>
<p>This device is going to shape the next decade in electronics industry.</p>
<p>decade? at least.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35135700.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I presume this will be just the first release. If it turns out successful and they manage to root out all possible bugs and stuff, they will surely make a clip on version, which you&rsquo;ll be able to attach to all sorts of accessories like glasses and other&hellip; This has huge potential and is actually another big step to future tech as depicted in many films&hellip; :) I like and hope it will be a success&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://preview.images.memegenerator.net/Instance/Preview?imageID=4240352&generatorTypeID=&panels=&text0=shut%20up%20and%20take%20my%20money&text1=&text2=&text3=" alt="" /></p>
<p>As long as Google keeps pushing the envelope, I&#8217;ll keep giving them my money. Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant!!!!</p>
<p>more ways to shove ads in our face!</p>
<p><img title="Google Glasses in Reality" src="http://www.anony.ws/i/2013/02/20/Po3fe.jpg" alt="Google Glasses in Reality" /></p>
<p>Hahaha, epic !</p>
<p>That would be annoying. People wouldn&rsquo;t buy it.</p>
<p>the glasses? or the viagra?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a single product (Glass), so when I say &ldquo;it&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m referring to that.</p>
<p>I was joking. When I say &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m referring to you.</p>
<p>it will happen.</p>
<p>WIN.  Ads everywhere.</p>
<p>this is <span class="caps">JUST</span> what i was imagining roflmao</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s their ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want a pair, no way I&rsquo;m putting a camera on my face or talking to people with one.</p>
<p>Just seems like a big marketing stunt, sorry your life won&rsquo;t be more exciting because of Google Glass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of hard <span class="caps">NOT</span> to call it a marketing stunt when you have engineers jumping out of planes.</p>
<p>I think the whole point is to show what it can do, not to suggest you&rsquo;ll suddenly pick up a new hobby.</p>
<p>mine will be.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t want one, you can&rsquo;t fail to admit that the technology&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Just 6 years ago Apple were introducing the first iPhone with a 300MHz processor. Now we&rsquo;ve got to where we are now &ndash; amazing display tech, octa-core <span class="caps">ARM</span> processors, tiny cameras. That&rsquo;s incredible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite excited about what these could do&hellip;not necessarily when it&rsquo;s released as it will be limited, but where it will lead 5, 10 years from now. It&rsquo;s a jumping point, and I&rsquo;m glad someone is leading the charge. Functionality will expand, hardware style will be normalized, and of course safety issues will be addressed.</p>
<p>The existing generation who are not necessarily tech diehards may not find Google Glass particularly useful or preferable, but I think this is going to have better traction with a new generation born into a mobile world. It is tech of the future, we should embrace it and perfect it.</p>
<p>So what is going to stop  annoying people in the room with you to say &ldquo;ok glass, send a text to my boss, your a dipshit..&rdquo; You get my point. How will it know its you and not someone else?</p>
<p>Personal voice recognition?</p>
<p>Hahaha. Didn&rsquo;t think of that Google..</p>
<p>If it doesn&rsquo;t recognize the wearer&rsquo;s voice specifically, that will definitely be a problem. I see a lot of rick rolls in the Glass users&rsquo; futures if they haven&rsquo;t considered this.</p>
<p>If it has two microphones, it should be able to judge where a sound is coming from.  If it&rsquo;s not coming from right below it, then it gets filtered out / ignored.</p>
<p>Well I would hope that it autocorrects to &ldquo;<em>you&rsquo;re</em> a dipshit&rdquo; in case his boss is a grammar nazi.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s me talking, the bone conduction receiver will pick up the vibration.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35136057.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>if sh*t&rsquo;s just got real real, Bill would definitely prioritize eliminating it over malaria.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35136603.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Bill Gates is the original Borg. Visit the MS section on slashdot.</p>
<p>So the mic is constantly monitoring? Doesn&rsquo;t sound battery efficient.</p>
<p>Also sounds like a good opportunity to troll wearers by shouting commands at their glass.</p>
<p>The whole point of the device is to operate it via voice commands, so I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve thought of that and are still polishing it up.</p>
<p>wat about a bone vibration mic</p>
<p>huh? gamers already using voice activated mic when they game.</p>
<p>Ok. So how long before we all get connected to the hive mind?<br />
&ldquo;We are Google your technological and biological distinctiveness will be added to our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>man this looks so cool, can&rsquo;t wait to see how glass improves in the future.</p>
<p>2014, in India</p>
<p>Google: Indians we r here finally<br />
People:ho, finally a year later &hellip;rushes to buy<br />
Indian government: wait&hellip;no no no&hellip;we hate your camera&rsquo;s&hellip;.we already made it clear that ,with your camera&rsquo;s in street view cars&hellip;did u guys forget those 100&rsquo;s of  caws got rust while sitting idle in Bangalore )<br />
Google:pls govt..everywhere in the world got it and use it daily<br />
Indian govt:remove camera from the glass then we may consider<br />
Google:shit again<br />
People:fked!!</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t recommend you enough. The first thing Indian Government will do is to brand Google Glasses as a &ldquo;Security Threat&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hi res video like this yeah? Sure, where&rsquo;s that getting stored then&hellip;</p>
<p>Biggest use case <span class="caps">POV</span> porn, obviously</p>
<p>the cloud</p>
<p>im 100% sure casino&rsquo;s worldwide will ban use of google glass.</p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed the camera(?) looking back at the person wearing Glass? It would be cool to use eyes tracking to navigate Glass.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, Google <span class="caps">DID</span> file a patent for utilizing eye-tracking as a gesture input, which everyone obviously correlated with Glass.</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;ll be a &ldquo;left-eyed&rdquo; version, as I have next to no vision in my right eye.</p>
<p>turn it upside down&hellip; duh</p>
<p>Ever tried to wear normal glasses upside down? It&rsquo;s basically impossible &ndash; they just slip off your face.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure there will be.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m going to bet&hellip;someone out there is now frame for frame looking for a van with a dslr video&hellip;</p>
<p>Love it.  Too cool!</p>
<p>Did anyone notice the &ldquo;Google Jellyfish!&rdquo; part? It looked very similar to what was in the Google pixel video</p>
<p>Good spot! Maybe Google&#8217;s just trolling us?</p>
<p><em>Flash forward to Google I/O&hellip;</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; and every single one of you is getting a Glass and a Pixel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Man, all these people are doing exciting things I&rsquo;ll never do. Like sensuously touching a giant ice cube.</p>
<p>wuooouuuu its fuck*ng amazing..!</p>
<p>The part that got edited out&hellip;.</p>
<p>- Person boards roller coaster.</p>
<p>- PA system announces to place all loose articles of clothing or belongs including cameras and glasses in the pouch in front of you</p>
<p>- Woman in Google Glass video says: &ldquo;heck no, I&rsquo;m recording this&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Roller Coaster starts</p>
<p>- Woman in Google Glass Video: &ldquo;Ok Glass, record video&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Roller coaster car takes does major drop on video followed by a few sudden turns</p>
<p>- Suddenly, Google Glass is recording lots of loops as it falls from the woman&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>- Park attendant notices expensive Google Glass on ground</p>
<p>- Park attendant picks up Google Glass and says &ldquo;OK Glass, wipe memory.  You&rsquo;re mine now&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well shit, I&rsquo;m gonna go hang out beneath a rollercoaster. Fuck paying $1500 for one!</p>
<p>Well the video made it to us so&hellip;</p>
<p>The park attendant actually posted the video on the original owner&rsquo;s YouTube account before wiping the glasses and making them his own.  I must have left that part out.  :)</p>
<p>Thanks for completing the story. What would we ever do without your first hand witness account of what happened?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>What happens when there&rsquo;s a bunch of people close to each other wearing this and one of them says a command? It would trigger other person&rsquo;s glass?</p>
<p>How can you say &ldquo;NO&rdquo; for this? its just a thing of dream.</p>
<p>Where are all the ads?</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s not <span class="caps">THAT</span> stupid&hellip;</p>
<p>Make this standard issue to the <span class="caps">LAPD</span>!</p>
<p>I have a hard enough time keeping my glasses on while laying in bed watching a movie&hellip;..how are these people keeping them on why doing the flying trapeze.</p>
<p>use your imagination.</p>
<p>oh, and you need new glasses.</p>
<p>A couple of my geek friends are salivating over this, and I agree it is pretty cool. However, does it have any mass market appeal? This reminds me of the smart watch field in that regard.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it has mass-market appeal for at least 5 years but that&rsquo;s not the point. Many industries and niche markets would benefit hugely from this. It just has to live up to the expectations set in the video.</p>
<p>I do think Google expects to make money off of these glasses, so I think being able to sell these to non geeks is key. Obviously the price will come down, and perhaps google sees these as eventually replacing smartphones. If that is the goal, talk about disruptive tech!</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t really question the value of making &ldquo;Googling&rdquo; even more of a reflex than it already is for people.</p>
<p>Look at what Android has done for Google, and what the intentions were :)</p>
<p>Most everyone in the &ldquo;smartphone owner&rdquo; demographic is going to want a pair of these.</p>
<p>Was anyone able to watch this without smiling like an idiot?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be smiling when everyone is running around wearing these<img title="" src="http://memoryglands.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/388.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Eye damage will be a thing of the past</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got 2 words, <strong><span class="caps">HOLY</span> <span class="caps">SHIT</span>!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>This is nice. It just isn&rsquo;t $1500 nice. Or even $1000 nice.</p>
<p>I think Google said before the consumer version will be $300-$500.</p>
<p>probably $300 nice :)</p>
<p>So I need a data plan for my glasses now too huh? And I want a high speed wireless device above my eye just in case I get lost skiing (lol) or I want to film some part of my massively exciting day? I can see YouTube being flooded with even more retarded videos made my kids doing dumb shit. Also, banned everywhere. Also, pedo,s will love these.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you Mr. Sunshine today&hellip;</p>
<p>you find the dark cloud in every silver lining or just this one.</p>
<p>i bet you&rsquo;re awesome with the ladies.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll wait for the contacts</p>
<p>one thing is sure!this isn&rsquo;t will it sell!the 64 $ question is will it be fair priced for it to become mass market like cellphone technology or only elitist will get this .I wouldn&rsquo;t  be surprised if the nexus 5 didn&rsquo;t have no camera onboard(huge amount of space saved)and google glass was the thing instead!and I bet almost everybody would love the idea.it would mean even sexier nexus and this glass when not needed you leave it at home!<br />
very true!a lot in the smartphone industry will be hurt!you would think at 60% +market google would sleep on their laurel!this will finish those skeptic!</p>
<p>very true all agent of any kind should have this,for their protection and others!</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t believe Google Glass is actually becoming reality. Part of my brain still thinks this is some sort of fictional thing. <span class="caps">ZOMG</span>&hellip;</p>
<p>I remain unconvinced.  Who wants to wear battery-powered glasses that you have to talk to all day?  I don&rsquo;t even want to wear regular glasses all day.</p>
<p>Like every other electronic device, you don&rsquo;t have to use it all day.</p>
<p>popup message duration is probably adjustable</p>
<p>This will definitely cause accidents on the road&hellip; but hey we need to move into the future in some fashion</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t cause any more accidents than watching a billboard on the side of the road&hellip;or turning to your <span class="caps">GPS</span> for directions.</p>
<p>Why, does the &lsquo;fuel low&rsquo; indicator light coming on in your dash make you fly off the road?  A little pop-up in your periphery isn&rsquo;t going to put you in danger.</p>
<p>Looks really cool, I&rsquo;d buy one for just playing with&hellip;but the tech clearly isn&rsquo;t there just yet, in 10 years this could be a thing, I don&rsquo;t expect it to be much more than a gimmick upon initial release though, but the future looks bright.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so torn between wanting this but not wanting to look like that&hellip;  If Google could implement this into a more &lsquo;normal&rsquo; form factor I&rsquo;d go stand in line to go buy it.  Normal like just plain glasses.</p>
<p>Is she riding a llama at 1:19?</p>
<p>Llamas are notoriously poor at jumping over obstacles, so it seems unlikely. Perhaps a large dog breed?</p>

<p>Sergey has already said Glasses will never have ads. Strong promise to hold.</p>
<p>Why would they, they&rsquo;re not free.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people would be interested into a ad supported version, with targeted ads that aren&rsquo;t intrusive at free price if this thing hits off and is in limited supply ..</p>
<p>I would get ad supported version for $300.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m absolutely skeptical. But you know what, this video made was the most exciting thing I&rsquo;ve seen in a long time. I even got goosebumps!</p>
<p>So those pictures show how Glass will look on incredibly attractive people, lets see how they look on the simpsons comic book store guy</p>
<p>Want. Can see where recent products like Google Now are leading. Apple should be scared because they don&rsquo;t have the infrastructure, expertise, and the data to make something like this possible.</p>
<p><span class="caps">EXACTLY</span>.</p>
<p>About the only other company that might have something like this up its sleeve is Microsoft, but i don&rsquo;t think they have the AI chops for it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll make Siri quite jealous and drive her crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Google, show me female breasts&rdquo; daa-dinggg</p>
<p>Frappp frappp frappp&hellip;</p>
<p>Between that and taking video, I&rsquo;m not impressed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frappp frappp frappp&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you fap, is it frothy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a double-shot fappachino, please&rdquo;</p>
<p>OK, so you&rsquo;re not interested in female breasts&hellip;you do know that&rsquo;s not the only thing it does, right?</p>
<p>where&rsquo;s the glass? I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Tech news today feels like &ldquo;Hey, we still exist too! Look at this cool stuff!&rdquo;, leading up to the PS4 reveal tonight.</p>
<p>Cool tech that very few people will be able to use to it&rsquo;s full potential  due to the crappy US wireless carriers.</p>
<p>Too tick, wont work for most people since it obstruct looking at the right (at 2 o clock)</p>
<p>This looks horrible.  Stop &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; with people who couldn&rsquo;t care less what you&rsquo;re doing, and take some time to appreciate the moment with the people who are actually with you.</p>
<p>Except this video has shown sharing with people the Glass wearers cared about, no one posted &ldquo;look at me im skydiving suckers&rdquo; on Facebook.</p>
<p>What if you&rsquo;re actually by yourself?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s not true in your life, but people not physically at your side could actually care about what you are doing.  I know, it&rsquo;s crazy.  That whole thing about people caring about each other.  Who would have thought that my mom would like to see my son at his birthday party since she couldn&rsquo;t spend $600 to fly over for the day.</p>
<p>except i only share with people who i care about that are not actually there with me. as i travel often for work &ndash; i care more about people who are not with me than i do with my travel mates.</p>
<p>what should i do then, sensei?</p>
<p>I think people keep talking about distractions without actually reading up on how it works. Its apparently supposed to work like a fighter jet heads up display. If you focus on the display you won&#8217;t see it clearly. Only when you focus on the world out in front of you will the display show clearly and looks like its drawn on the world. I believe this is why they said they have to work on making it work with glasses etc. So basically if you get distracted and try to look at it you won&#8217;t be able to see it.</p>
<p>By the way is this projected? I wonder if they&#8217;ll use the new transparent display technology.</p>
<p>Projected, yes.  If you look close, you can see a small mirror embedded in that little glass block at a 45 degree angle.  I assume it shoots the light out of the side, and the mirror focuses and directs the image into your eye, so that it appears at a distance your eye can actually focus at.</p>
<p>What about ARG&rsquo;s? I can see endless possibilitites there.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even use Siri in public.  Now I&rsquo;m supposed to talk to my glasses?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till Google&rsquo;s AdvertisementOS gives me creepy customized ads whenever it wants to.  Sergey says no ads.  Sounds like another empty promise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a solution looking for a problem.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re working on other input methods. I don&rsquo;t think that voice will be the only way.</p>
<p>Then don&rsquo;t use it. Not everyone likes to use new technology. If you feel the alternative is more convenient, by all means.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting how much less they seem to be doing this time around compared to the last demo movie google put out.</p>
<p>10 years from now, this stuff will probably be really great, but I think we&rsquo;re in for some rocky years between now and then.</p>
<p>kind of reminds me of how windows 8 is forcing mobile and desktops together&hellip;it doesnt <span class="caps">QUITE</span> fit yet.</p>
<p>maybe within the next iteration? looks promising though</p>
<p>+also i hate the google voice lady,  cant we get a British butler voice?</p>
<p>Great &ndash; One more step towards Google Mind Control Devices. Coming soon to a future near you!</p>
<p><span class="caps">OTOH</span>, aluminum foil is readily available at a pantry near you.</p>

<p>Seems to be a lot of willful ignorance in the comments</p>
<p><span class="caps">TAKE</span> MY <span class="caps">MONEY</span> <span class="caps">NOW</span>!!!</p>
<p>Even when they make models wear this thing, it still looks goofy as hell.</p>
<p>not at all. those women looked pretty hot.</p>
<p>Ha ha&hellip; can&rsquo;t wait to see someone wearing Glass in public&hellip;</p>
<p>Walk up behind them and say &ldquo;OK Glass&rdquo; <span class="caps">LOL</span></p>
<p>And that person would look at you funny and their Glass would ignore you.  Between the dual noise-canceling mics and the bone conduction tech, it&rsquo;ll be able to tell whether a command is coming from the person wearing the device or not.</p>
<p>Cool stuff. I don&rsquo;t see myself using one. It&rsquo;s like the bluetooth earpieces &ndash; disturbing.</p>
<p>:throws credit card at monitor:</p>
<p><span class="caps">TAKE</span> MY <span class="caps">MONEY</span>!!!</p>
<p>Google has the wrong translation on cover image.  The pic has chinese word which means Chinese cabbage, not half pound, lol.</p>
<p>I think it is for the wear to know how to order half a pound of cabbage. After all, half-a-pound in chinese in also in the display.</p>
<p>I have a really boring life&hellip;</p>
<p>Finally true <span class="caps">POV</span> porn !! :)</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what Go Pros are for?</p>
<p>I guess if you&rsquo;d gonna have sex on a ski mountain or sex on a fishing boat at high speeds. For everything else. Use the minimalist Google Glass.</p>
<p>Looks like an early version of D-Space.</p>
<p>Read &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo; by Daniel Suarez if you want a glimpse at what life with augmented reality could look like if we&rsquo;re fortunate enough.</p>
<p>-not associated with the author in any way</p>
<p><span class="caps">POV</span> porn is going to skyrocket.</p>
<p>My Google+ Circle of jerks is going to take on a new meaning.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago tif you took pictures and filmed people without permission it was considered rude behavior, jerks, perverts, &amp; pedophiles. I truly hope every one who points these at people who wish not to be filmed or photographed going about their day all get black eyes like back in the day. This is a trojan horse and I feel sorry for this next generation of kids who are being brainwashed into thinking this is acceptable behavior. Cant fight technology though Im sure it has its uses but it will be abused by almost everybody you don&rsquo;t have a right to go around filming strangers and uploading it to the world. I mean people dont even call 911 anymore if they see somebody get robbed or beat up they whip out theri phones and upload to youtube as if they have that right</p>
<p>Everyone who is against this should be buying gps/wifi/cell phone jammers</p>
<p>lol. ^ you sound <span class="caps">AFRAID</span> of this brave new world.</p>
<p>homestead my friend. we&rsquo;ll stay off your lawn.</p>
<p>Andy Rooney? Is that you?</p>
<p>The dashcam for your life. Pretty soon they&rsquo;ll be compulsory!</p>
<p>Should be for Police&hellip;</p>
<p>Agreed. </p>
<p>i would get contacts or lazer eye surgery for google glass. dammit i want it naow.</p>
<p>Dorkiest thing ever.</p>
<p>OK, Voice Control. That answers the big question I had about how you interact with the darn thing. I still wonder if it Tethers or if it has it&rsquo;s own dedicated data connection. I also hope it will have an ear peice or something so you can have private conversations with the video chats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still leary about Voice Control, but Google Now is <span class="caps">REALLY</span> good, so I&rsquo;ll give it a chance when it comes out. I&rsquo;m glad they made it a truely hands free experience. Only question left is if they can get the price down. I&rsquo;d have a really hard time paying more for this than my actual phone.</p>
<p>hopefully its own data collection and hopefully on google&rsquo;s dedicated data network.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DAT</span> GL&ndash;ASS.</p>
<p>Id buy some to see if i could wear them and play football (soccer), it would be quite fun i guess.</p>
<p>Imagine watching a player scoring for a world cup winner goal in the final from this. Mindblown.</p>
<p>For as neat as this looks I still don&rsquo;t find myself wanting one.</p>
<p>The fact that you have to wear glasses, talk alone and that it&rsquo;s obscuring your direct vision make this device useless for everyday. Remember 3D glasses? Yeah nobody wants to wear that. I think Google Glass would be better in my car windshield, motorcycle helmet, ski goggle, for security guards, etc.. that would be awesome. I don&rsquo;t have and don&rsquo;t want to wear glasses everyday, maybe if they make it so it works with contact lenses, that would be a better option. Otherwise I don&rsquo;t want glasses on my face.</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a name for people who can so quickly and effortlessly see all the reasons why something won&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>otherwise, i guess i respect your opinion?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t obscure your direct vision, it&rsquo;s in the corner of your eye.  <span class="caps">BTW</span>, a vast majority of people wear some sort of glasses.  Let&rsquo;s not act like it&rsquo;s some massive burden.</p>
<p>The navigation feature is intriguing for driving &ndash; already cheaper than getting navigation system + <span class="caps">HUD</span> in many cars.</p>
<p>This will be very popular with the pervs.</p>
<p>With the possibility of incriminating yourself, who knows?</p>
<p>I wish I were as active as all the people in that video. My Google Glass videos will consist of playing video games on my couch and eating Taco Bell. Can&rsquo;t wait to show that off to the world!</p>
<p>There are lots of people in the world who would be amazed by your life, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>working at google must be awesome. they probably hire a bunch of smart people and give them unlimited creative freedom and funding. it feels like google glass was made that way. most of today&rsquo;s tech is inspired by sci-fi from 20-30 years ago.</p>
<p>while most of the tech that&rsquo;s been coming out in the past decade is groundbreaking and liberating, it feels like the innovative pulse is starting to plateau. google glass takes this to another level. i would say the technology offered by it is teetering on the edges of debilitating and infantile. most of the stuff in the advert doesn&rsquo;t need the glass at all. playing with your kids in the park? it&rsquo;s not exactly necessary to take the picture of every moment; plus, i highly doubt the camera in that thing will be higher than the 8mp stuff in today&rsquo;s smartphones. moving on, checking stuff like flight tickets, recipes, and mundane google searches are flat out overkill for this device. pulling out a smartphone is becoming sooo tedious. imagine, thousands of people, walking around with these cyborg-inspired glasses saying &ldquo;glass find me a cafe. glass where is the closest gym. glass where can i eat?&rdquo; how about you look around?</p>
<p>this thing definitely has practical uses, like pulling up an image for reference, like ice sculptor did, or navigation, or dictionary, or the nutritional information of food, but none of those really necessitate a commitment to an eye-wear accessory. that said, there is market for it, definitely, but whether it will be the next cellphone, i doubt it.</p>
<p>Thank you! Finally I can read an article and comments about mobile tech without someone talking about their iphone.</p>
<p>Apple who?</p>
<p>Google, meet: Oakley. Please.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely cool.. but i still feel like it&rsquo;s kind of gimmicky&hellip;</p>
<p>I really wouldn&rsquo;t want to live in a world where every second that people&rsquo;s eyes are open, they&rsquo;re connected to a virtual world. As if we&rsquo;re not connected enough with smart phones. Like Josh said in the Vergecast a while ago, you could be sitting down having coffee with someone and have no idea if they&rsquo;re talking to you or doing anything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of like flying cars to me. It&rsquo;s what everyone thinks is the future because it&rsquo;s cool new technology, but it doesn&rsquo;t really make anything better.</p>
<p>Oh man I can&rsquo;t wait to get this no matter how dorky I look.</p>
<p>Dorky or uberfreakingcoolassmotherfudger.</p>
<p>Ok, computer!</p>
<p>This is so stupid. I would rather strap a bomb to my chest than wear glasses that makes me look like a pretentious douchebag</p>
<p>Cell phones made you look pretentious years ago.</p>
<p>Takes one to know one, I suppose?</p>
<p>This video makes me incredibly excited and sad at the same time. Excited because it&rsquo;s freaking awesome, and sad because I know it will never be able to live up to my ridiculous expectations.</p>
<p>Is Google Malware built-in?</p>
<p>I see Google haters are not very witty&hellip;</p>
<p>Damn. Goosefuckingbumps all over.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d trade my left kidney for that.</p>
<p>The command &ldquo;OK Glass&hellip;&rdquo; feels really &lsquo;human&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself for the era of the first person ultra shaky youtube video</p>
<p>So does this mean I&#8217;m going to have a cell signal right next to my head?  I don&#8217;t even place my cell phone up against my ears unless I have to.</p>
<p>More importantly, the speech UI doesn&#8217;t seem like the best way to operate these glasses. It would be far cooler to use gestures like Kinect.  They could even have a Z axis so the UI isn&#8217;t limited to the dimensions of the glasses&#8217; display.</p>
<p>Google has some great tech but UI and design definitely isn&#8217;t their strength.</p>
<p>When traveling this would be great, (translations and directions) but around my city perhaps not</p>

<p>You know what&rsquo;d be great? A not-the-same-language-as-you person talking to you &hellip; and subtitles appear on the glass. lol</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is happening very soon.</p>
<p> The camera is the wow factor. But it will also kill it before it get any traction. Have you ever tried snapping a picture of a woman you may know at work or school randomly? They all duck and hide. It creeps people out to have a camera pointed directly at your face by someone for personal viewing. Its not like a security camera you find in malls or stores with the camera above. When women realize the damn thing has a camera I quarantee it will fail!</p>
<p>This is truly sensational. Seeing this technology becoming a reality makes me cry&hellip;</p>
<p>  I still say this will fail. The camera is the cool factor. But its also the weekness. No one wants a camera pointed directly at there face whenever you talk to someone randomly, whether you know them or not. They have to remove the camera.</p>
<p>Shweeeeeeeeeeeeeeet!</p>
<p>Really? I find that rather expensive. For that sort of money they better throw in the rest of the Borg Drone outfit as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Less than $1500&rdquo;, jeez seriously? What happened to the affordable Google we used to know?</p>
<p>Early adopters pay more.  This is the market for products like this.  Most first gen products cost more than their successors.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to annouce the real retail price just yet, so they&rsquo;ve said it will be less than the price the developers had to pay. Does this mean it will cost 1400$ when it ships holiday season 2013? No it doesn&rsquo;t. The real price could be even 500$, we just don&rsquo;t know right. Stop making rush deductions based on pretty much nothing.</p>
<p>I personally wouldn&rsquo;t pay higher than 600$ for these.</p>
<p>As much as they are futuristic, and Google is doing a fantastic job, but, atm, it&rsquo;s still only an accessory.</p>
<p>And even when it&rsquo;s not anymore, I wouldn&rsquo;t personally pay for these more than I would pay to get an high-end current gen phone.</p>
<p>In its current incarnation I wouldn&#8217;t buy it. If they hit the level of features in that concept video from last year, I&#8217;d buy one for $300.</p>
<p>From my understanding, this is just a Bluetooth device-the connection is still being supplied by your smartphone, so why this would cost far more seems silly.</p>
<p>it has a gps chhip</p>
<p>It has <span class="caps">GPS</span> now, but just wait for next rev, they&rsquo;ll put a Sim card in them.<br />
At even $800 for rev 2.0 they&rsquo;ll go viral</p>

<p>Not trying to sound rude here or anything, but the whole point of Glass is to take your eyes <em>away</em> from your phone.</p>
<p>This product pretty much requires a constant connection so I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they got some carrier deals on contract later on. But for the first gen, I doubt it. And it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;pretty much nothing&rdquo; when the company itself states &ldquo;less than $1500&rdquo;. If it was significantly less, they would have said so. For now, it&rsquo;s probably safe to assume $1000 to $1499 range.</p>
<p>The product only has wifi connectivity. It can share the 3g/4g connection of a smartphone. The addition of cell radios would ruin battery life presumably.</p>
<p>Lol this might be cheaper than the Pixel</p>
<p>A good example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer wii U console  = $5000.</li>
	<li>wii U price = $300.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a surprise for you. Google is interested in making money, not giving stuff away for free. Sometimes the two overlap, not always.</p>
<p>For showing ads in my right eye they might want to be a little cool on the price.</p>
<p>It will go down eventually. The beauty of offering premium first is that developers will be thinking of ways to satisfy customers with higher expectations rather than pandering to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, Google has stressed repeatedly that there will be no ads on Google Glass. &ldquo;There are no plans for advertising on this device,&rdquo; says a Google rep. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re more interested in making the hardware available.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are no plans for advertising,&rdquo; and &ldquo;there are no ads&rdquo; are two very different things. There are <strong>currently</strong> no ads, and plans can change.</p>
<p>(See also: Facebook, instagram, Apple iAd, gmail, etc, etc, etc, ad nauseam.)</p>
<p>Dude, have you been paying attention? Google is not putting ads on there.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t they make money off people downloading apps, just like the app store does for apple?</p>
<p>Obviously they should be charging money for the glasses, but there are tons of ways they can make money off paid apps.</p>
<p>Especially since they are already starting to announce their releases!! Saw this on #ifihadglass feed: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE7VP1ObhOs" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE7VP1ObhOs</a></p>
<p>Funny how this video shows my biggest problem with primarily voice operated hardware. I don&rsquo;t want to have to whisper in public just to take a picture. Not to mention, these could get banned in corporate settings for letting you take discrete pictures.</p>
<p>Remember when the first iPad came out and all the rumours were about &ldquo;less than $1000&rdquo; and then it came out at like 400 or something. Could be the same deal.</p>
<p>Hope so!</p>
<p>That was rumors vs reality. This is an official statement from Google, so I highly doubt it. More likely $1499 like another poster said. Apple does this too.</p>
<p>Once they give the technology to partner OEMs, the pricing is really more up to each individual manufacturer. A pair of Warby Parkers are already considerably more expensive than the average pair of glasses you can get from a Wal-mart. This is why they are going to work with several different companies that will offer a wide array of price points eventually.</p>
<p>This is the same strategy they&rsquo;ve developed with Android.</p>
<p>1499.99 is less than $1500&hellip;lol</p>
<p><span class="caps">OVER</span> 9000&hellip; pennies</p>
<p>It might be worth $100 as a novelty, but I can&#8217;t see people paying a whole lot more than that.</p>
<p>Do you have any respect for technology? $100? Seriously?</p>
<p>He buys his <span class="caps">KIRF</span> shit from china!</p>
<p>If Apple is selling, you will be first in line lapping this up.</p>
<p>Its the mindset of people like you&hellip;Even if google produces quality stuff, people are not ready to buy.<br />
Josh praised the quality of the product.</p>
<p>what are you even doing in a tech site??</p>
<p>If Apple makes a product as worthless as Google Glass you can be damn sure I&rsquo;d be equally as disappointed in them as I am in Google for making this.</p>
<p>I would pay 1500 for one now.</p>
<p>It seems that for first-use, someone in some form of profession (like a journalist or something) would gain more from using Google Glass than everyday Joe Schmo Consumer&hellip; which would make sub-$1,500 price tag quite a bargain actually.</p>
<p>Just relax, it will get to what ever price you want eventually.</p>
<p>Guys, we gotta stop feeling so entitled. I&rsquo;m sorry but we&rsquo;re getting here a full computer with audio/video capture, internet connection on the go and voice recognition, in a package that&rsquo;s slightly bigger than an eyeglasses frame &ndash; 5 years we could only imagine it in sci-fi movies and now we&rsquo;re about to get for real in possibly less than 10 months, we&rsquo;ve got no right to complain about the price. Especially since is quite the feat of engineering.</p>
<p>Look I&rsquo;m not saying that $1500 is a good, or even appropriate price, because I don&rsquo;t know, and neither any of us. For all we know, it costs them $2000 to produce each unit, so even for $1500 they&rsquo;re losing on it. That&rsquo;s probably not the case but dude &ndash; you&rsquo;re getting a wearable computer with voice recognition, come on!</p>
<p>For me, if they can bring the price down to a $1000 bucks I&rsquo;d be happy, and anything lower than that ecstatic. And it&rsquo;s somewhere between $1000 and $1500, well then I&rsquo;ll just probably wait for the prices to come down but I won&rsquo;t complain.</p>
<p>Sounds about right. $1500 for the early-adopter version. A year later,  Google will sell a faster/cheaper version with fewer bugs.</p>
<p>Early adopters can pay the premium price. The rest of us can wait a little longer.</p>
<p>$1499.99</p>
<p>Well look at the Nexus 4, priced from $299. This has many less components involved, I highly doubt it will be more then that. My guess would be $249 max.</p>
<p>Kind of expected, wasn&rsquo;t it? Still awesome nonetheless.</p>
<p>After the price of the pixel, I actually thought $1500 was their discounted price for the people they except in their program.</p>
<p>you meant &ldquo;accept&rdquo; in their program?</p>
<p>yes&hellip;. I honestly have no idea how to explain that one</p>
<p>Between this and the Chromebook Pixel, it seems Google is on a path to being more of a premiere brand than Apple</p>
<p>I still want this, but maybe v2.0</p>
<p>Except the expensive Apple stuff actually sells.</p>
<p>Sad isnt it?<br />
technology and innovation no matter who develops it..should be praised.<br />
After the initial iPhone which was a game changer, I see this as another leaf in technology which &ldquo;has the potential&rdquo; of a game changer.</p>
<p>Pshh it&rsquo;s going to cost the same as the Chromebook Pixel</p>
<p><img title="Pshh" src="http://static.quickmeme.com/media/social/qm.gif" alt="Pshh" /></p>
<p>$1499 is less than $1500 but do not forget the taxes and shipping charges. Will let someone else bleed on the bleeding edge and no doubt live with the Google Ads that will be pushed out to people.</p>
<p>Google has repeatedly said that there will be no ads on Glass. Stop that.</p>
<p>read articles before trolling..<br />
google clarified that there will be no ads for google glass.</p>
<p>Oh, this is expensive! But still amazing product!</p>
<p>Just reading Josh&rsquo;s experience with them.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>I wonder if Glass will be able to sync with Android receive notifications &amp; manage</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be there when the early adopter pricetag has eroded to my budget.</p>
<p>But wow, 2013&hellip; cool.</p>
<p>If it does sync to your phone&rsquo;s notifications, this seems somewhat illustrative of the Google/Apple dynamic&mdash;Google&rsquo;s busting out a potentially revolutionary format from pretty hefty R&amp;D, while Apple puts yet another ho-hum smartwatch on the market.</p>
<p>Apple haven&#8217;t put anything on the market yet</p>
<p>Neither has Google. Future tense&mdash;I hear it&rsquo;s cool. Even when it&rsquo;s implied.</p>
<p>Except Google have announced theirs&hellip;</p>
<p>Not to put a down on the whole thing but what are the chances of regulatory problems re the video taking thing. Potential to be a perverts&rsquo; paradise?</p>
<p>Most people already have two cameras on their phones. Bit late to start worrying about that!</p>
<p>They said the same thing about mobile phone cameras and in England at least filming people in public is completely legal so I don&rsquo;t see any issues.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://imgur.com/1ZWomRU" alt="" /></p>
<p>Jesus Christ Google&#8230; The components here cost a few hundred dollars at best. It&#8217;s your nascent technology that you think people would like to wear&#8230; It needs to be under $500 at least, if not under $300!</p>
<p>Huge R&amp;D costs for first generation devices. Will flatten out by the second generation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it works.</p>
<p>Walkman, iPod, iPhone &ndash; all dropped in price by at least 20% within the first year. Seems kind of like how it works.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t drop in price until there is a competitor, that&rsquo;s simple micro-economics.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s expensive and doesn&rsquo;t sell well it would drop price regardless of competitors. Simple supply vs demand.</p>
<p>It is using a transparent display and has nearly a full phone in it (seems it runs independent of any device).  And yeah, its first generation, so lots of R&amp;D to be made up with this one.</p>
<p>After that, if it is worth continuing and the market grows with more devices, prices will come down.</p>
<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t have any display at all.  Out and about, if you don&rsquo;t have a 3g/4g connection on your phone to pair it with then it doesn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>This is not true, the whole point of the device is that it is a display&hellip;</p>
<p>Sorry I wasn&rsquo;t being precise enough. It&rsquo;s pretty clear that the person I was replying to meant a panel-display, hence &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;. This does in-fact use a form a projection-display.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you really understand the &ldquo;under $1500&rdquo; comment. It&rsquo;s in relation to the fact the early adopter sets currently &ldquo;on sale&rdquo; by Google are $1500 so when someone says &ldquo;Oh $1500, are they going to cost that much when they&rsquo;re out of beta&rdquo; Google has said &ldquo;No, they will be less&rdquo;. Does this mean $1000? $500? $300? We don&rsquo;t know, all we know is a tiny bit of information relating to the fact the dev ones cost $1500 right now.</p>
<p>Really? Few hundred dollars at best?? Unless you&rsquo;re on the Google Glass team you&rsquo;re pretty much talking out of your ass.</p>
<p>Good by savings!!!</p>
<p>Google may be officially selling them by then, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they won&rsquo;t have the same chronic supply shortages that have plagued their other device launches.  Here&rsquo;s hoping they have that figured out whenever this does launch.</p>
<p>I want one.  Will it sync to my iPhone?  :)</p>
<p>In Josh&rsquo;s hands-on with it he mentions that it will work with the iPhone. I sure hope it&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>It uses the data connection from any Android or iPhone when it&rsquo;s not on wi-fi, yes that is how it will work.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a range. I hope they&rsquo;ll make it affordable, they wanted &ldquo;millions of people&rdquo;, after all. Also, if it costs less than $1299, Google has no reason to not lower the price of the Pixel.</p>
<p>Does the verge just have a reporter stationed at google? You guys seem to get a lot of exclusives from them lately</p>
<p>I love the idea of Glass but I do not want to look like a complete toolbag either.  It looks like something a host of a bass fishing show would wear.</p>
<p>Start saving your hard earn dollar for another product of the year 2013.</p>
<p>No one is going to buy these if they&rsquo;re over $300-$400.</p>
<p>There you go, speaking for everyone in the world again.</p>
<p>I will. Stop being poor.</p>
<p>They should use Pixel as a currency now, &ldquo;We aim to price it at less then 1.16 Pixels&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Okay, that&rsquo;s markting speak for $1499.</p>
<p>The price feels appropriate for people who don&rsquo;t care looking like idiots while Google is spying on theirs lifes</p>
<p>If its $500, ill take one. Eh at $1000.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s $1000 I&rsquo;ll take one. If it&rsquo;s $500 I&rsquo;ll take two. I&rsquo;m not even kidding.</p>
<p>Ballin, eh?</p>
<p>you know, now that I think of it, 1000$ isnt actually that bad&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see why the first version of this couldn&rsquo;t be quite affordable, even within the $200 range (I&rsquo;d guess more likely around $500, just for the high-end desirable must-have perception).</p>
<p>Sounds like the first iteration will do a <em>lot</em> less than the Nexus 7 currently does (albeit, they are entirely different devices) &mdash; there aren&rsquo;t really any incredibly expensive components in this thing.</p>
<p>Do you not understand the fact that this is a developers beta model of the device at the moment?  Google funds the R&amp;D and they put this product out which is not an easy task.  These initial models for their high price are like this because they are brand new and have to get money back to Google for some of their initial input monetarily.  Later on, when official iterations start to get released, Google will undoubtedly begin to lower the price just as the same process occurs in every other device.  Look at the normal price of a smartphone without a contract right now though if you want and see that for like the galaxy s3 it is obscenely high and much more than with a contract.  Another thing to keep in mind when saying no one will buy it.  maybe when iterations with cellular radios begin to come out, they will come cheaper with contracts as well.</p>
<p>You do understand that they must have spent an immense amount of time engineering the components to fit in a package the size of flash drive, right? It can do most things a standard smartphone can do but is a fraction of the size; it costs money to do things like that.</p>
<p>lol @ less than 1500.  It has to be 10 times less.</p>
<p>I imagine many countries will be banning these devices whilst driving&#8230;</p>
<p>I feel like this looks less distracting than using a phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve driven a Camaro with the <span class="caps">HUD</span> and it was great being able to see all of the info it displays without moving my gaze from the road. Having directions display on glass rather than needing a phone mount (if you don&rsquo;t have nav built in).</p>
<p>They said literally the exact same thing last year at Google I/O.  How is this an exclusive?</p>
<p>I cant see it selling very well if it is over $500. I mean $500 is already alot for some glasses that doesn&rsquo;t do much.</p>
<p>Then why would over $500 be an unreasonable price for a pair of glasses that can record video and search the internet?</p>
<p>Because its still basically a companion device. It&rsquo;s utility is superbly limited without a smartphone attached.</p>
<p>Exciting as this is the next evolution in computing form factor!  First it was the mainframe that occupied a whole room then minicomputer, desktop, laptop, brick phone, pocketable phone and now hands-free eyewear.  Amazing watching the original Star Trek as a kid then seeing the communicator materialize and now the beginnings of the <span class="caps">VISOR</span>.</p>
<p>I think you guys have gotten used to getting too much free stuff, google should just hand over everything to you guys for free.</p>
<p>so&hellip;&hellip;.$1499?</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s under $1500, than that make it kinda tempting for me.</p>
<p>It was obviously going to cost less than the current prototype price.</p>
<p>I sure hope it&rsquo;s less than $1500. $500 would be the sweet spot, but I could go a little more depending on the final product. I&rsquo;ll definitely be counting my pennies up until launch.</p>
<p>those blue ones are so pretty</p>
<p>If i had the money to buy Glass or the Chrome Pixel i would choose Glass.  I can understand why Glass is expensive but can&rsquo;t really understand why Google is selling an expensive Chromebook.</p>
<p>Hardware wise this should be cheap you don&rsquo;t need quad ore <span class="caps">ARM</span> and a tegra chip for this and it does not support <span class="caps">LTE</span>? So where&rsquo;s the 1500$ price coming from? Development cost shoud be swallow by google <span class="caps">IMHO</span> an sell the hardware for 129$ to glasses makers so they can add another 150-200 to it <span class="caps">IMHO</span>&hellip;</p>
<p>Your opinion is nonsensical and you are stupid.  Pay attention to what people are saying and learn a few things.</p>
<p>So, these will be $1499, eh?</p>
<p>Glass will remain a smalltime, niche product until they can hit smartphone prices; like $300 or less.  And there&rsquo;s no reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get it down that low considering that it&rsquo;s essentially a low-powered smartphone in a different form.</p>
<p><img title="Colbert" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mb1jnyNXog1rhiulro1_250.gif" alt="Colbert" /></p>
<p>Glass is so awesome that I still want it for &ldquo;less than 1500 dollars&rdquo;, whatever that means. I&rsquo;d buy it even for 1500 dollars, because this thing makes me feel that the Future as we are dreaming of it is really coming.</p>
<p>&hellip;And it&rsquo;s far more interesting product than a 1449 notebook with <span class="caps">LTE</span> module and a web-browser, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Just realize that people will laugh at you even more than women do now when they see you naked. And that no&hellip;your life/job is nowhere <span class="caps">NEAR</span> important enough that you need one.</p>
<p>Hmm, $1500 for a headset that helps explain/record what&rsquo;s already in front of me, or $300 for an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset that shows something <strong>much</strong> more awesome?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the company that makes this tech without shackling/forcing me into a specific type of service. Until it works without constantly feeding a data machine to know more about everyone, it will, I hope, have less appeal. The concept is tremendously cool, but I think we all still need to reclaim the control and value of our info/actions.</p>
<p>For less than $1500 it&rsquo;s a bargain.</p>
<p>$1500? Wow, I thought they&rsquo;d be free, government-issued cow tags. I guess the non affluent aren&rsquo;t worth tracking with that level of overhead right now&hellip; and if you don&rsquo;t think $1500 is a lot then you don&rsquo;t understand poverty by a long shot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never use it to take photos and video, and instead use my dedicated cameras like I always do. My main use for it will probably be navigation. However, I didn&rsquo;t quite know how I would use a tablet until I bought one, and started using it regularly, this will probably be the same way. I&rsquo;ll start saving up.</p>
<p>It will cost $1499 because that is indeed less than $1500.</p>
<p>Sergey mentioned that Glass will be available for &lsquo;significantly less&rsquo; than $1,000</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re using the $1,500 price point to deter competitors who think that Glass is going to fail because of the high cost.</p>
<p>My prediction is an introductory retail price of $499.</p>
<p>There really isn&rsquo;t that much hardware to it. Perhaps they could still make a profit at that point.</p>
<p>This would generate a new round of buzz and create additional excitement for the device. Then everyone would really want one.</p>
<p>Everyone with a brain knows that it is going to fail. It is simple&hellip;no one <span class="caps">NEEDS</span> one. It won&rsquo;t make anyone&rsquo;s life better. So the only reason to get one is to feel cool. And NO <span class="caps">ONE</span> is going to feel cool with these things on. And no one who sees people with these things one will think they are cool.</p>
<p>No one really <span class="caps">NEEDS</span> a smartphone yet they sell incredibly well. You can make calls just fine with a standard flip phone but smartphones provide conveniences that people have decided are worth the extra money. My thinking is that the same thing can happen with this, especially if developers can really add compelling features to it, just like they did with the iPhone.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ONLY</span> $1500 for some stupid looking glasses that will cause idiots to walk into buildings, cars, etc? <span class="caps">WHAT</span> A <span class="caps">DEAL</span>! /s</p>
<p>If you listen close enough, you can <span class="caps">ALMOST</span> hear the sound of not a single person caring.</p>
<p>Remember outcasts&hellip;no one will <span class="caps">EVER</span> say on their deathbed &ldquo;I really wish  spent <span class="caps">MORE</span> time on the internet when I was alive, instead of actually <span class="caps">LIVING</span> MY <span class="caps">LIFE</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only question is if this will bea bigger Google failure than Google Checkout, Google Video, or Google Plus.</p>
<p>$1499? No way! They would have to pay me <span class="caps">MUCH</span> more than that to look like a total tool wearing one of those. You see..I have a life <span class="caps">OFF</span> the internet. And it is really much better. I can&rsquo;t imagine wishing I could be online even more than I already could be if I wanted to be.</p>
<p>But I guess the market for this product are people who have given up ever <span class="caps">HAVING</span> a life, or even tryingt to lose their virginity. So for them, maybe it is a good thing. Something to prevent the pathetic from committing suicide for another year or so. but when you get to your mid 30s and you realize that you have wasted your entire existence (not a life&hellip;an existence) online and you have no social skills to ever get a <span class="caps">REAL</span> life, that suicide will come whether you have these or not.</p>
<p>These are meant to use the internet to <span class="caps">ENHANCE</span> your everyday, real-world life. You&rsquo;re not literally browsing the web on your glasses.</p>
<p>What?!?!? Do you not carry your phone everywhere with you? If it is a smartphone, then the internet is always with you.</p>
<p>I can see these things getting snatched off people&rsquo;s faces just like Iphones and ipods.</p>
<p>jeez thats a little pricy but i still want like crazy</p>
<p>For those who are not software developers or economists, the cost of computing shifted from being primarily for hardware to primarily for software in the 1960s, and product price is determined by supply and demand as much as it is by cost of hardware, software, marketing, advertising, etc.  There is a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of software involved in this project, both within the incredibly tiny device and on Google servers.  Software is never really free, even in open-source form &ndash; there&rsquo;s a bunch of person-hours of labor required whether or not money is directly exchanged.</p>
<p>Only about 10,000 Explorer devices are being built, so $15,000,000 of the development cost is being passed on to developers and early adopters, as is usual.  If the Explorer experiment works and people come up with sufficiently interesting use cases, then they can drop the retail price to something more acceptable to consumers &ndash; I would guess around $300 if demand materializes.  Note that they&rsquo;ll be delivering devices to I/O attendees as well as Explorers simultaneously, which tells me not enough I/O attendees signed up (or their credit card charges were declined &ndash; understandable considering the cost of I/O these days).</p>
<p>As for the actual cost of the hardware, you do realize no one pays $199 for a smartphone &ndash; it&rsquo;s typically at least $800 without a contract, and upwards of $2,600+ with an average $100/month, 24-month plan.  Glass is more than a whole step up over the miniaturization in a smartphone &ndash; if the battery is going to last an entire day and evening of use on a charge with WiFi or Bluetooth active, video being recorded, data and images being downloaded, etc., it&rsquo;s going to require very expensive lithium-polymer technology, and the Glass camera and display are leading-edge miniaturized components.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t afford The Future now, just wait, we&rsquo;ll offer it to you at a lower price when it becomes The Ubiquitous Present.  No one realized they would find a smartphone useful more than seven years ago, or a tablet more than four years ago, but now many do, and eventually perhaps many will find Glass useful.  Demonstrating Glass may be one reason why Google is opening retail stores, which have proven indispensable for selling iOS products, and MicroSloth is trying to flog Surface that way.  Only time will tell.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/jC5xjdO.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d pay that for $400</p>
<p>We in <span class="caps">NYC</span> will the big event be ? There headquarters ?</p>
<p>How many of the contest winners will actually buy the glasses ????</p>
<p>Looks as awkward to use as it does to wear.  People constantly glancing down at phones has been replaced by people constantly glancing up and to the right (there&rsquo;s a <span class="caps">JFK</span> joke here).</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look comfortable or practical to use, even if they somehow get it to be less ugly and obtrusive.</p>
<p>I do see niche uses for this, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Are you kidding?  These things are awesome!!!<br />
    - Navin Johnson</p>
<p>Seems legit. I&rsquo;d buy it. Oh and Josh looks pretty sexy with them on.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact his eyes looked like they were rolling to the back of his head!&hellip;. It&rsquo;s cool but Google has a way to go for Glass to become a legit product.</p>
<p>No lie, this looks freaking awesome! The future is coming! Totally want a pair now, I&rsquo;ll be the coolest kid on campus!</p>
<p>What happens when everyone else gets one? No longer cool eh&hellip;</p>
<p>Is the Google guy following Josh on the street at the end of the video? :)</p>
<p> Looks like him and the redhead. Also look at the old lady on the right, looks at Josh like he&rsquo;s a weirdo with that on.</p>
<p>yeah, they are looking for him.</p>
<p>Putting his hand up to the side of the glasses like that makes him kinda look like a Cyclops wannabe, getting ready to shoot a laser beam out of his eyes.</p>
<p>when are the apps actually going to be available!? I want to see my facebook and twitter feed!</p>
<p>Is there going to be a list of available apps published? Apps are randomly announcing their release on the stupid #ifihadglass feed &mdash;&gt; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE7VP1ObhOs" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE7VP1ObhOs</a></p>
<p>Josh normally wears glasses.   Was he wearing contacts for this?  I&rsquo;m really curious as to how this will work in the future for someone like myself that wears glasses.</p>
<p>Ah, the apple of my eye.</p>
<p>Nice pun.</p>
<p>I seem to be on that train of thought lately</p>
<p>Yes, thanks, I didn&rsquo;t get the joke before.</p>
<p>No, no, it was..what&rsquo;s that word that&rsquo;s the same backwards as it is forwards?</p>
<p><strong>thinks for a second</strong> a palindrome?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>(if you haven&rsquo;t seen this famous Monty Python sketch, go watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npjOSLCR2hE">it</a>. Now.)</p>
<p>I see what you&rsquo;re getting at!</p>

<p>Never been so excited about new tech. This is truly an entirely new category of products.</p>
<p>We really are living on the edge of the future.</p>
<p>Ah yes, I believe they refer to it as the present day.</p>
<p>Zing.</p>
<p>Haha. Perfect.</p>
<p>True, but then my parents thought the same thing back in the 50&rsquo;s, when the &ldquo;future&rdquo; tech was all manner of&hellip;home appliances</p>
<p>Regardless, it&#8217;s exhilarating to feel that way. I&#8217;d hate to live in a country or era where things feel stagnant.</p>
<p>We could call it (I&rsquo;m so sorry) on The Verge.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go kill myself now.</p>
<p>No need to do that, just go stub your toe on the corner of a table.</p>
<p>That was uncalled for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s harsh man. No one deserves that.</p>

<p>Is that Nilay&rsquo;s kitten on the right?</p>
<p>good catch</p>
<p>Edit: never mind.</p>
<p>Would you care to say we&rsquo;re on <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">VERGE</span> of the future?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been less excited for something than I am for computer-glasses.</p>
<p>~ Someone who already wears glasses.</p>
<p>Dude, we get it already.</p>
<p>Yes, you hate google. Great. Can you please stop commenting now?</p>
<p>Has absolutely nothing to do with Google.</p>
<p>Glasses are a pain in the ass. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to wear them.</p>
<p>Get contacts.</p>
<p>Get laser eye surgery.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wearing them wrong.  They go on your face, not your ass.</p>
<p>get femtolasiked.. -6 to 0. best xmas present I&rsquo;ve bought myself ever.</p>
<p>As a person who wears glasses, your comment is funny on so many levels.  I give up; no way to explain.  I&rsquo;ll just laugh to myself.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re against glasses that actually do something other than being a pain in the ass?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got to wear them, why not have some that are actually useful?</p>
<p>How are glasses a pain in the ass? They&#8217;re a functional necessity of your life that allows for a great aesthetic addition to your wardrobe.  I think the only time I&#8217;ve regretted using them instead of contacts is going swimming, since I&#8217;m effectively blind once the goggles are swapped in.</p>
<p>playing basketball, going karting, going to gigs(dropping your glasses at a slipknot gig gives an adrealine rush though!), doing any sports at all, they limit fov, need to be cleaned, you see less while in mixed sex sauna, you see less when having sex, makes harder to watch 3d media, pain to use skiing goggles, swimming in the ocean sucks with them and you can just forget about diving, and try wearing these goggles with glasses.. &ndash; the reasons just pile up and image hipster glasses make me just puke.</p>
<p>how are they <em>not</em> a pain in the ass?</p>
<p>and I wore glasses for ~24 years of 31 years.. lasers rule. of course I don&rsquo;t regret wearing the glasses because I didn&rsquo;t really have a choice(eysight kept changing until now pretty much yearly).</p>
<p>Wait&#8230; b/g wifi, Bluetooth 4.0, bone-conducting speaker, screen projection into your eye ball&#8230; As excited as I am, this sounds like a lot of scary stuff to be strapping to my head for 12+ hours a day. Will Belkin make a tin foil base layer accessory?</p>
<p>Powered by the new Chrome OS.</p>
<p>Or a ChromeDroid hybrid?!</p>
<p>Why is everyone so obsessed with Chrome and Android merging?</p>
<p>Operating System copulation is sexy.</p>
<p>because the last time two OS&rsquo;s merged we got <span class="caps">ICS</span> :-)</p>
<p>Or windows 8</p>
<p>The more I use Win 8 the more I am repulsed by it.   Perhaps they could have added a simple feature which detects the presence of a touch screen and enabled the metro look/feel.</p>
<p>We likes the mash up.</p>
<p>I wonder what the specs are?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re called Google Glass. The article is about them&hellip;..ohhhhhhhh, wait, you meant the <em>specifications</em>&hellip;..<span class="caps">LMAO</span>!</p>
<p>I see what I did there.</p>
<p>I appreciated this comment more than I would have expected myself to.</p>
<p>Though you would be seeing what you did there through rose tinted glasses, since you wrote the joke yourself, right?</p>
<p>Pointing out that you made a terrible joke doesn&#8217;t add layers, it just drags out the misery</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see what it can do at this point in time.  Last we&rsquo;ve heard, it could only power a looping video, right?  Hopefully it will have an actual OS on it! :D</p>
<p>That looping video report is almost a year old at this point.</p>
<p>Huh?  That was <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3121858/googles-project-glass-first-impressions-with-sergey-brins-headset">six months ago</a> at Google I/O.  They said there was a small menu systems but they&rsquo;ve never showed them off.</p>
<p>No, that&rsquo;s a different product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting it gets most of it&rsquo;s processing power from a phone/tablet.</p>
<p>Yep, like a smart watch.</p>
<p>Anything else would be excessive and cost too much battery life.</p>
<p>Congratulations for stating plurality opinions as your personal creation</p>
<p>Ah, the car accidents that will be caused by this product. I predict &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Glass and Drive&rdquo; PSAs in 2014.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s self driving car, problem solved.</p>
<p>I wish Google sold those and provided Google Glass free of charge with unlimited wireless data-only plans to your car and mobile devices via their new network. Ahhh, the Dream.</p>
<p>The regulatory hurdles of self driving cars makes 2024 a more realistic timeline.</p>
<p>Unless part of it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">HUD</span> is actually a <span class="caps">HUD</span>. So useful when driving it could indicate things like: Beware drunken midget throwing tires from an overpass ahead, veer right to avoid death.</p>
<p>This would be useful in my town. We are in the middle of a midget tire throwing epidemic at the moment.</p>
<p>I think we need to ban tires and serving liquor to midgets.  Somebody needs to advance their political career by being strong on pandering to fears.</p>
<p>You know, this happens <strong><span class="caps">FAR</span></strong> too often. If Google could fix this, I might start driving again.</p>
<p>Do these <span class="caps">FCC</span> filings only show what kind of radios devices have? Or do they also include some of the other specifications, like <span class="caps">CPU</span> or storage?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they would release every single spec that is available.</p>
<p>802.11b/g/n? Engadget and the <span class="caps">FCC</span> filing mentions b/g only.</p>
<p>Yea I&rsquo;m pretty sure it said b/g here as well just a moment ago</p>
<p>Seems a bit of an ommision if true, with 802.11ac coming in the future. No-one wants to be 2 generations behind.</p>
<p>I am ready for advertisment to be beamed directly into my eyeballs. Also, I&rsquo;m going to go home and reread M.T. Anderson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Feed&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is so friggin&rsquo; amazing that I had to register just to comment. Wohoooo! We are living in the future!</p>
<p>I wanna vomit every time I see this stupid picture.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NOW</span> <span class="caps">LET</span> ME <span class="caps">TRY</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> ON.</p>
<p>That will go great with my Nexus 5.</p>
<p>Im sure they already working on an Otterbox that encases your entire head in shock resistant plastic.</p>
<p><img title="Otterbox for Google Glasses" src="http://di1-1.shoppingshadow.com/images/pi/a0/29/e8/112751706-149x149-0-0_rawlings+rawlings+rubberized+matte+catchers+helmet.jpg" alt="Otterbox for Google Glasses" /></p>
<p>How much does it cost  ? $1500 ?</p>
<p>now, Apple &hellip; step aside &hellip; the next device for the elitist is here</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the consumer price, that&rsquo;s an inflated price to get serious developers and testers on board.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not even a price for ownership, it&rsquo;s a price for <em>rent</em>.<br />
Google will still own all these development Glass&rsquo;es.</p>
<p>Thats the early dev prototype price.</p>
<p>I think that technological advancement is pretty much the only field where &ldquo;trickling down&rdquo; really works over the course of time. At least it has over the course of the last 100 years in the developed world (starting with fridges, vacuums, later cars and now computing devices etc.). We&rsquo;re still in the time where ressources are abundant, so we can expect this to go on for at least one more decade. I would assume, you&rsquo;ll be buying this thing &ldquo;soon&rdquo; for a lot less than 1500 $&hellip; if you can accept the strings attached.</p>
<p>True that.</p>
<p>Tim Cook just doesn&rsquo;t beam out that &ldquo;innovative product aura&rdquo; that Apple so desperately needs.</p>
<p>Rather leave if to Google to do the real work and deliver the future to us. ;)</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t know what Apple&rsquo;s been up to under Cook until this summer. I think google has a lot more creativity stewing at its campus, but I&rsquo;m not going to count out Ive and Apple.</p>
<p>This is Google we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>$399 on the Play Store, ships at some random time over the next five years.</p>
<p>almost had me choke on my Mike &amp; Ike&rsquo;s</p>
<p>And even then you won&rsquo;t be able to buy any of the announced accessories :P</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wait for the moto X-Glasses.</p>
<p>Moto X pretty much is google. It&rsquo;s all coming out of the X labs.</p>
<p>@ Nathan I&rsquo;m guessing the reason for a difference between fcc filings is maybe there will be different models available.</p>
<p>Just make a comment, I&rsquo;m sure we can see that it&rsquo;s directed towards the article.</p>
<p>sorry im kinda new here</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one to reply to the editor, so I guess it&rsquo;s fine. ;) Also possibly a valid point by supastar.</p>
<p>Sneaky edit function is sneaky&hellip;</p>
<p>Bone conduction speaks just sounds painful.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t, actually-I&rsquo;ve used a bone conduction headset in the Army for radios and it&rsquo;s just like having earbuds in. It&rsquo;s tricky to get your own voice understandable back out, though.</p>
<p>hahaha I just had to imagine a soldier in full gear having trouble to speak properly because of that. aaah, the future is bright</p>
<p>Its like raising to a new level of self-proclaimed importance above just simple bluetooth douche.</p>
<p>I thought the next step up was the ShamWow douche?</p>
<p>I still wouldn&rsquo;t wear them.  Getting there, but not quite.</p>
<p>I already wear glasses so this is my dream to incorporate these into them.  I know everyone sees these for the consumer market but just imagine for a second how great these things would be at a work environment where usually both your hands are taken up.  It would be pretty cool if you were to be putting together something with these in and they guide you every step of the way.  Also the handicapped would also benefit greatly from these also.</p>
<p>i can imagine see some workplaces will be banning google glass for security concerns</p>
<p>also : at consulates</p>
<p>Suppoes you want it over your left eye instead?</p>
<p>No one cares about lefties!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a leftie but I have retinal damage in my right eye.</p>
<p>They need to bypass the eyeball and go straight for the optic nerve.</p>
<p>Oh, they&rsquo;ll get there soon enough; this is Google we&rsquo;re talking about here.</p>
<p>What are you a communist?</p>
<p>Be gone, foul beast!</p>
<p>I know we all saw the concept video of these, and that was great, but does this do anything more than record video? Google I/O&rsquo;s presentation left so much to be desired.</p>
<p>From what I understand, they are working toward an interface much like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">&lsquo;One Day&hellip;&rsquo; Glass teaser video</a> you mentioned.  Because this is a Google X (Skunkworks) project with a small team they are putting them in the hands of developers to really help nail down the most useful interface, device integration, and applications.  At the moment the easiest thing to demonstrate is its usefulness in photo and video because they are not available for the public to go hands on.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t foresee being able to fly my starship with one of these in 2014, but I do imagine Google Now being a <span class="caps">HUGE</span> part of Glass when it (hopefully) releases next year with augmented reality and better intelligent assistant functionality.</p>
<p>Typo edit posted a reply for some reason.  Nothing to see here!</p>
<p>how do you augment reality?</p>
<p>Gonna order my N4 tonight!! woot woot then I will have a s**t eating grin like this guy, look t it!</p>
<p>Any thoughts on what Glass will retail for when it&rsquo;s on sale this holiday?  Obviously it won&rsquo;t be anywhere near the $1,500 price of the developer prototypes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking $399.99 <span class="caps">USD</span>.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we call innovation.</p>
<p>Steve Mann would disagree</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b84/Dano9181/steve-mann2ed.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Silly, it&rsquo;s only innovative if google does it.</p>
<p>He does not look like a guy you want to disagree with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I was in a brightly lit room when I saw that. Scary.</p>
<p>As soon as somebody figures out how to integrate this tech into a normal pair of prescription glasses, I&rsquo;ll be all over this. It looks super dorky in its current form, but if they just look like normal glasses, which a lot of us have to wear all the time anyway, that massive barrier of appearance will be removed.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://silellak.com/gifs/shit-just-got-real.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>think about meeting someone and looking at them as you are looking at a google search return on them. it doesn&rsquo;t seem very human/real/cool &ndash; but then again it seems almost impossible to imagine that this wont happen. and google is working on all of the pieces of the puzzle &ndash; geo, voice to text, image search, etc &ndash; might as well hand the keys to our civilization over now.</p>
<p>dont resist evolution</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d call it evolution.</p>
<p>That will be cool when strangers can pull up my mugshots just by looking at me.</p>
<p>Developer: Yes! My google glass just arrived I can&rsquo;t wait to try this on and walk around. <br />
Google Glass: (30 minutes later) <span class="caps">WARNING</span> <span class="caps">LOW</span> <span class="caps">BATTERY</span>!</p>
<p>why can&rsquo;t they incorporate this into a less bulky design?</p>
<p>hybrid lcd glass or something to that effect.</p>
<p>On a side note; incorporating or make a modular version of this system for motorcycle helmets and i&rsquo;ll happily hand over my cash.</p>
<p>These are not the glasses you were looking for.<br />
Not really impressed.   When someone makes a contact lense that can do the same image reality, then wake me up.  This is a gimmick for the peculiar few who will draw just enough attention to themselves to get mugged just for what they have.</p>
<p>Hope they come with a virtual woman app because a real one would be out of the question.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the second generation of Google Glasses to come out.</p>
<p>Now Police have to catch people for watching movies while driving !!! With google glass :)</p>
<p>I could not understand by the term &ldquo;bone conducting technology&rdquo;. Is it any <a href="http://www.q3tech.com">software application</a> that connects with your sensory organs directly or is it anything else.<br />
Would love to know more about it.</p>
<p>Does &ldquo;bone conduction technology&rdquo; also work as &ldquo;boner conduction technology&rdquo;? Would be a major selling point if so.</p>
<p>Watch porn discretely 24/7!</p>
<p>Anyone know who&rsquo;s providing the tech for this? It sounds a lot like what Parametric Sound has been working on; I wonder if they&rsquo;re involved.</p>
<p><em>Welcome to the <span class="caps">BONEPHONE</span> <span class="caps">ZONE</span>!</em></p>
<p>When the third world country can buy this product. $1500 is too much costly for us for this glasses. Please Google provide this as cheap as possible. We are keen to wear this.</p>
<p>does it come with x-ray vision app?</p>
<p>Dear The Verge,</p>
<p>Can you please stop using this creepy picture of Sergey for all Google Glasses articles? Please replace it with this one:</p>
<p><img title="better picture of google glasses" src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/7533163/2012-06-27_16-00-19-1024_large_verge_medium_landscape.jpg" alt="better picture of google glasses" /></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/PfeVP7Y.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This picture is better imo</p>
<p>isn&rsquo;t there a rendering/device only photo?</p>
<p>The only thing I wish is that I had my Google Glasses and Google Fiber right now! Best of luck testing these products, Google: a lot of people are very eagerly waiting for the future of technology to get going.</p>
<p>That dude is creeping me out.<br /><img src="http://www.synergy-sponsorship.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Polaroid_Lady_Gaga_GL20_Camera_Glasses_Peripheral_Gadgets.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Wait a minute. Xbox Google Glass? Is that what Josh is wearing?</p>
<p>Those are the Fortaleza glasses that Microsoft will release next year(WiFi only) and a 4g version in 2015.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what the new place is going to look like!</p>
<p>Uh oh careful josh is likely to pop out somewhere</p>
<p>Please do a video tour of the new office once you get settled in!!! :)</p>
<p>P.S. The new studio set with the wood backgrounds looks the best yet :)</p>
<p>Yay! <strong>waves Adi flag</strong></p>
<p>(joins in the Adi wave)</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you guys move to the new office quite some time ago? I saw Josh post about it on Twitter.</p>
<p>Yeah, i&rsquo;m wondering if they&rsquo;re still moving or if they are moving again.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve only ever had this office &mdash; SB Nation had a video studio that we borrowed for the Vergecast, the first episodes of 90 Seconds, and some of our live shows, but they&rsquo;re moving to the new office (and our big new studio) as well. It&rsquo;s going to rule.</p>
<p>Hey, pay your rent next time and I won&rsquo;t chuck you out !</p>
<p>Did she say Noogle?</p>
<p>Hey</p>
<p>Hugely exciting. The whole computing world is changing around us, and we&#8217;re living through it!</p>
<p>2014 will be a fascinating year in technology, as will 2013. After years of speculating, it&#8217;s all coming together.</p>
<p>But MS has something better than this</p>
<p>Show me</p>
<p>2007 was a Year on Innovation: Rise of the Smartphones<br />
2008 was a Year of Competition: Rise of Android<br />
2009 was a Year of Expansion: Expansion of the Smartphone World<br />
2010 was a Year of Competition: Rise of Samsung with the Galaxy S<br />
2011 was a Year of Leadership Transfer: From Apple to Google in Smartphone Percentage Domination<br />
2012 was a Year of Competition: Rise of RIM, Nokia, Microsoft, and Jolla<br />
2013 will be a Year of Waiting and seeing what happens. Based on this Innovation will strive in 2014.</p>
<p>2014 Will be a Year of Innovation. (HINT HINT, no more competition, only Survivors.)</p>
<p>2013 is clearly the year of the Linux desktop</p>
<p>All /s aside, may almost be true if Ubuntu for Android gets any traction, and if ARM computers continue to become a big thing. Linux on ARM is certainly a ton more functional than Windows 8 RT on a standard computer.</p>
<p>The desktop and laptop space may become what netbooks were like before Intel released Atom processors / Windows re-released XP for netbooks.</p>
<p>It would still be fairly niche as the distrobution network just is not there for Linux, however I could see some OEMs moving from Win8 RT to an ARM Linux distro.</p>
<p>Add in the fact that Valve looks like is tossing its weight to the Linux side of things.</p>
<p>Pfffffftt</p>
<p>It could very well be true if Valve managed to making gaming on Linux a reality. A large number of Windows users are Windows users is because of games.</p>
<p>This exactly.  You have your business users who use Windows for work.  A lot of them then have a personal laptop that is Mac.  However, a majority of windows users now use it because of games.  I know for certain that is why I use it.  Once valve can show it is feasible and easy to put games on linux we might actually have game developers developing for linux also.  One of these days it will happen!</p>
<p>If Windows 8 fails the way it&#8217;s been failing, I don&#8217;t see why your assessment is wrong.</p>
<p>I thought 2012 was the year of Google TV.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget developers going to Android before iOS.</p>
<p>It is in some cases.</p>
<p>Just nowhere near what &#8220;market share&#8221; numbers would suggest.</p>
<p>Hasn&#8217;t RIM been declining all year? 2013 is supposed to be their comeback year&#8230;if they even have one.</p>
<p>Also, I don&#8217;t recall Jolla producing anything in 2012, please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>
<p>Lastly, Microsoft and Nokia are not yet in the same ballpark as Google, Apple and Samsung as far as smartphones are concerned. That was supposed to change with WP8, which was just released about 2 months ago. MS and Nokia may have risen a little in the last 2 months of the year (and even that hasn&#8217;t been proven yet), but the first 10 months of the year they seemed pretty stagnant.</p>
<p>2012 was definitely not the &#8220;Year of Competition&#8221;, I&#8217;d characterize it more as the<br />
<i>Year of Tablet Competition: Rise of $200 Tablets</i></p>
<p>or if you want something more smartphone focused&#8230;.<i>Year of 2 Platforms: The Slow Death of BlackBerry and Windows Phone</i></p>
<p>Dafuq, are Smartphones the only lead you define how a year went or will go by?</p>
<p>2002 was rise of smartphones.</p>
<p>Smartphones were essentially around in the late 90s &#8211; they were unpopular because internet and email were nerd things at the time and it would still be a while before young cool trendsetters would embrace technology. But the Reality Distortion Field has done away with all that history a while ago.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs personally and with little to no help from anybody else invented the smartphone in 2007. All other smartphones are copycats, the idea behind them stolen from the mind of the greatest genius to ever have walked the Earth.</p>
<p>A patent does not equate to a product. A product equates to a product.</p>
<p>So does the military I bet. Maybe even apple. Your point is?</p>
<p>Obvious troll is obvious</p>
<p>no they dont, microsoft doesnt innovate,</p>
<p>kinect they bought it, and it useless for gaming. because it doesnt do 1-1 tracking, or worls well at all</p>
<p>MS didn&#8217;t buy the Kinect, just the lens for them.  And by your comment I can tell you never used one, just read what someone else said!</p>
<p>Pfft, I was given one as a gift and it&#8217;s a piece of crap as a gaming interface.</p>
<p>It is crap for gaming</p>
<p>Windows 8 was innovation, as was IE 1 and Windows.</p>
<p>Both copies of existing products.</p>
<p>Like the iPhone (copy of existing concept of touchscreen-dominated smartphone, with ONE innovative part, namely a capacitive screen)</p>
<p>Your point is? It&#8217;s entirely possible to innovate while standing on the shoulders of giants. Not everything is about making something that is entirely new; arguably, improving something that already exists is just as important, if not more.</p>
<p>You probably would not care to drive Carl Benz&#8217; original 1886 motorcar. Would you say that the Model T was a mere copy of an existing product, with some improvements which are not interesting because the Model T was not a fundamentally new invention?</p>
<p>As long as it has all the features that were shown in last year&#8217;s mockup video by the time it comes out to the public, I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p>Great to see that Google is being actively innovative with upcoming products and tech, unlike a certain other company&#8230; you can&#8217;t iterate on little things forever.</p>
<p>Exactly.  You can&#8217;t &#8220;see&#8221; that Apple is innovating, because they don&#8217;t tell anyone.  They just drop it on us one day, sometimes completely out of nowhere.  Like their Fusion Drive technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like their Fusion Drive technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not innovation, that&#8217;s a technology that&#8217;s already existed. Dynamic caching in a hybrid drive is honestly nothing special, they just tweaked their OS to take advantage of it. It&#8217;s classic iteration.</p>
<p>No, no, no. He was talking about their REAL Fusion Drive technology which will take yoir iShip to Alpha Centauri in less than a week (two days if you spring for the most expensive variant). Any case of severe exposure to interstellar radiation will be a result of you flying it wrong, and since nobody will return their unit, that shows you what a minor cocern it is.</p>
<p>That stuff will REALLY change everything.</p>
<p>This product has been endlessly fluffed by the tech press. They should stop mentioning it.</p>
<p>Okay. Hey all tech blogs out there&#8230;you should totally do what this guy is saying.</p>
<p>To be fair, there&#8217;s nothing really new here&#8230;</p>
<p>But there is interest. Its just like the self-driving cars which the press can&#8217;t stop gloating over and will likely not be available for another 5 years. Any &#8220;update&#8221; on such an innovative product is considered news-worthy because of the public interest.</p>
<p>I agree. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s humanly possible for me to be less interested in this than I currently am.</p>
<p>I dunno, it seems like you&#8217;re interested enough to reply five times to this post.</p>
<p>You were so disinterested and not thinking about this, that you had to tell everyone just how much you aren&#8217;t thinking about this.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an exciting idea, which is what the tech press thrive on. That said, it&#8217;s still vapourware right now and we can only hope it&#8217;s as good as the mock-up videos have proposed.</p>
<p>Google could change the way people live with these glasses. Much like the iPhone.</p>
<p>Think about what people are willing to do to NOT wear glasses.</p>
<p>This product is going nowhere.</p>
<p>Glass is going nowhere because some people prefer not to wear glasses?</p>
<p>Just like how iphones never took off because some people prefer a physical keyboard?  Just like how laptops never took off because some people want a desktop?  Just like how nobody would use a moving mouse when you can have a stationary trackball?</p>
<p>When I go to the office over half the people there are wearing glasses.  You might be a retard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about what people are willing to do to NOT wear glasses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this requires some explanation.</p>
<p>I know there are basically two alternatives to wearing glasses, contacts or surgery, and many people choose to wear glasses even when presented with alternatives. I know many people war contacts, and many others get the surgery. But despite all that, the prescription glasses industry sells millions of new glasses every year.</p>
<p>Just like windows phone!</p>
<p><em>Zing! </em></p>
<p>Yea, nobody wants to wear glasses. Just look at how cheap designer sunglasses have to be to get people to buy them!</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t want to be forced to wear glasses. But, tons of people still go out of their way to spend $100+ on a pair of sunglasses, as they are a great accessory.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>The best bit is how people with these glasses are going to get the living daylights beaten out of them (and maybe killed) by people who don&#8217;t like being recorded without permission.</p>
<p>The good thing is that there are companies crazy enough to take big challenges and weird projects and try to make them work.</p>
<p>I really hope Apple is secretly spending their absurd amount of money in research for amazing &#8220;futuristic&#8221; products. To bring this &#8220;future&#8221; to the present.</p>
<p>(Ps. I don&#8217;t hope apple is doing it because i want Apple-futuristic-products, i hope they&#8217;re doing it because they are the ones with more money to spend, and consequently the ones who can more easily do it.)</p>
<p>I agree. How are Google ever going to get this product right if they don&#8217;t have Apple to set the high bar?!</p>
<p>So does Apple sets the bar?  Or are they really good at selling you where you think the bar should be?</p>
<p>Well apple set the bar on smartphones there is just no denying in that. Remember Google saying that a phone without physical buttons would never work. Same goes for the iPad they set the bar and again it&#8217;s taking Google a long time to catch up. Same goes for Glasses. Google doesn&#8217;t really know what people want or will use because they don&#8217;t design for people, they only build with advertisement in mind.</p>
<p>Yes the world would still be in the Stone ages if not for Apple. We get it. They invent everything. Even when they steal.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it.  What are you actually trying to say?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using steal in the same sense that Apple fanatics use it (inspired by mainly&#8230;and I mean fanatics&#8230;not simple fans) but this is based on a discussion I had either on The Verge or one that I read somewhere else where someone was seriously SERIOUSLY trying to say that Apple&#8217;s notification center wasn&#8217;t inspired by Android&#8217;s notification panel AND that Android somehow through some weird way venturing back to the Lisa and Palm&#8217;s WebOS which came out after, somehow Android stole it from Apple or something&#8230;it was a weird conversation&#8230;</p>
<p>but my main point is that the people who big Apple up the most seem to understate or ignore the strides other companies have taken in tech&#8230;some of whom, without them a company like Apple wouldn&#8217;t be able ot thrive in modern markets.</p>
<p>Motorola sucks  and is no good despite their contributions.<br />
Samsung sucks (to a degree yes) but apparently they are not innovative at all and no matter what changes they bring or contributions they submit to civilization they aren&#8217;t important because Apple made a ground breaking OS 6 years ago and we should all be on our knees taking turns to kiss whatever CEO&#8217;s ring or if he pleases, gargle his apples.</p>
<p>I got a bit carried away there&#8230;to answer you&#8230;again, so many people act like the world would still be using Steam engines if not for Apple and only Apple is capable of making strides in tech and no one else innovates&#8230;etc&#8230;etc&#8230;&#8230;and that is simply not true.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it. What exactly are you trying to say?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s saying that Apple isn&#8217;t all that you&#8217;ve imagine them to be. They&#8217;re not <strong>that</strong> innovative. There I&#8217;ve point it out to you bluntly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll further that. They project more innovation than they actually perform. They have an excellent marketing department.</p>
<p>No Apple is pretty ground breaking&#8230;but they are not alone in that category. They invent no physical tech&#8230;they are mainly a software and hardware design company.</p>
<p>The chip advancements, screen advancements, data advancements, etc, etc, etc they have little or no part in.</p>
<p>Apple sets a very good product bar, and Google sets a very good information service bar.  Google is getting better at making products faster than Apple is getting better at information services.</p>
<p>iamtomalmond,<br />
I think anyone can &#8220;set the high bar&#8221;, it definitely doesn&#8217;t need to be Apple.<br />
So if you &#8220;agreed&#8221; with my comment and said what you said, you probably misunderstood my comment.</p>
<p>I said i hope Apple is also working on projects like this not because it needs to be Apple to be good (as i explained in my &#8220;p.s.&#8221;), but because they have a lot of money and very talented people (as does Google, but Apple has more money to spend).<br />
I want other companies to take the challenge as well.</p>
<p>And to your point of Apple setting the high bar, two things:<br />
1. Google and other companies also have great quality products.<br />
2. It is possible to imagine a certain &#8220;quality standard&#8221; that is usually considered &#8220;very good&#8221;, but in many cases, most of them actually, how much you like a product depends on what your needs and preferences are. So Google sets the high standard for some, and Apple for others. (:</p>
<p>I hope you can better understand my comment now.<br />
Have a nice day.</p>
<p>And also Apple will usually try to go all out to make the new product the best they can and try to set the bar high.</p>
<p>Like apple maps,antennagate,iphone coming out the box with scratches and etc. If you call that the best something must be wrong.</p>
<p>The iPhone antennae worked fine.  That story went viral via clueless people like yourself.   Similar to the maps story.  Although that had a nugget of truth, it got blown completely out of proportion.  I use Apple maps daily with zero issues.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t comment about the scratches because i&#8217;ve never seen them but seriously have you ever held a SIII? the iPhone5 build quality is far superior.</p>
<p>Is that why they changed the antenna design for the Verizon iPhone 4, all 4S models and the 5? Because there was no issue?</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s already been working on its own glasses just like Micrsoft has been too. Apple&#8217;s been working on it since 2006:</p>

<p>Most of these companies knows where technology is heading from motion control, to augmented reality, etc.</p>
<p>Oh, so Apple IS &#8220;secretly&#8221; working on this! I&#8217;m excited to know! And Microsoft&#8230; Well, it would be really cool if someday some of their awesome researches and projects really becomes a product! <br />
Thanks for the info sthkr! :)</p>
<p>Google is quite open with some of its secret projects, but they have a secret division that is responsible with experimenting over the top ideas and bringing it to life. Microsoft also has a secret research lab that helped make Kinect and Surface. Remember surface was such a well kept secret for 3 years even the manufacturers didn&#8217;t leak it out. Well, with apple, Apple itself is completely secretive!</p>
<p>Like the iphone 5 and ipads mini world best kept secret.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the original first generation of new products. The original iphone started development in 2004 and later launched in 2007. It was such a well kept secret including how Apple recruited only from inside Apple to work on the secret project&#8217;s software and hardware,</p>
<p>tablet computer prototypes and OS were <em>not</em> a well kept secret. only thing that was kept secret was that they were going to manufacture one with their own branding.</p>
<p>Did you hear about the amazing thin type cover for the suface before its release? Everyone can assume that a company will make a certain product, but they can&#8217;t forecast what kind of hardware or design it will be.</p>
<blockquote>Though Google is well known for its advertising business, Parviz claims that there are no plans to incorporate advertising into Glass. </blockquote>
<p>Yeah, Just like when Google won&#8217;t introduce ads to it search listing right?</p>
<p>The difference is that search is free, while glass is a paid product. Similarly, Google probably won&#8217;t be putting ads on your android homescreen any time soon.</p>
<p>Just because there aren&#8217;t ads on the home screen doesn&#8217;t mean that Google isn&#8217;t aggressively using Android for their maniacal advertising purposes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how you describe advertising as maniacal. If Google&#8217;s ads are maniacal I guess you better not go out/watch TV/read newspaper/join any social networking site. They all contain some form of advertising.</p>
<p>How do you know Glass will be a fully paid product when it&#8217;s released?  If they want market share maybe they&#8217;ll subsidize it with ads to foster adoption.</p>
<p>True, but I envisage a world where google will soon begin using your location data to customise ads for you. They are already very good and learning your movements etc, and personalising information using that data… just look no further than google now.</p>
<p>When did Google say they wouldn&#8217;t introduce ads into its search listing?</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;d like to see GG come to market, that company&#8217;s track record for maintaining projects leaves me unenthusiastic at best.</p>
<p>science fiction is becoming real<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>Talk about Nexus Q more ;-)</p>
<p>I told you guys a long time ago about this. Glass is not going to be using Android .apks or even most APIs. It&#8217;s basically ChromeOS.</p>
<p>Battery life is the thing they need to fix the most. They need to have it useable for a full day so you can charge it while you sleep. Oh and make it look appealing.</p>
<p>I wish they&#8217;d update us on what it can actually do other than being a camera on your head&#8230; which is in no way or form a revolution. It&#8217;s just silly how they are currently positioning it as an &#8220;OMG I can take photos of my baby!!&#8221;-thing. :/</p>
<p>I believe one of the biggest differences will come, when we fix the battery problem and I believe one of the easiest ways to do that is simply by tapping into body heat, movement and such. Charging on the go.</p>
<p>These devices powered by your movements will be part of a greater Personal Area Network that links together sensors, wearables, and devices to create a full range of expanded application opportunities.</p>
<p>Oh goodie! More work Google&#8217;s stealing from Apple through insider access:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a fan of apple products as much as the next person. But it&#8217;s not exactly stealing if you hire an employee from your rival company. This employee already signed a NDA with apple and cannot leak trade secrets from his work done at apple. His expertise is valuable though and he can create something new though.</p>
<p>Hm. A simple question. Do most people want to wear glasses?</p>
<p>I already do.</p>
<p>But do most people want to?</p>
<p>I already wear eyeglasses (you know, glasses that actually do something). There&#8217;s no way in hell I would ever voluntarily wear glasses. They suck.</p>
<p>Sucks to be you.</p>
<p>How immature are you?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s plainly evident how much you really don&#8217;t care about this.  :P</p>
<p>I have contacts, but just bought a nice pair of glasses. Still, it&#8217;s contacts for the most part.</p>
<p>Fake glasses is a rising fashion trend.</p>
<p>I know one thing that Google glass would be AWESOME if used for:   <a href="http://www.ingress.com" target="new">Ingress</a> !</p>
<p>Location-based social media is an area that both Google and Nokia are targeting.</p>
<p>Anyone else think google glasses has the ability to be the future of TV.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If you can watch TV while out and about.</p>
<p>Life expectancy: 26</p>
<p>What a horrible thought.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hopeful but skeptical about Glass.  I can&#8217;t imagine how they&#8217;re going to solve the battery problem, unless Glass is just glorified Bluetooth eyewear with a built in camera.</p>
<p>On the other hand, their self driving cars would literally change the world:  saving thousands of lives, ending traffic jams and drunk driving, and potentially allow you to read or sleep while traveling.  Talk about a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Glass has the makings of a high-mid range of Android devices, but is mostly based around ChromeOS. This is one way that they&#8217;re trying to make it an all-day device. It&#8217;s not a simple accessory.</p>
<p>Ok, but how does using ChromeOS make it an all-day device?</p>
<p>You still have the physical limitation of building a battery into a form-fitting pair of eyeglasses.</p>
<p>I think the physical limitations state that it must be a Bluetooth accessory, with your Android phone serving as the real CPU.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ll be happy to be proven wrong)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that bluetooth accessories with displays have a particularly good track record. Has anyone tried that Sony smartwatch? I remember reading that it had major problems holding a connection, which would make it not reliable enough for what Google wants Glass to do. It should be noted that I&#8217;ve never personally used a smartwatch, so I could be mistaken.</p>
<p>Also, the way they&#8217;re talking about this product, it seems clear that it uses a cloud based platform, which implies ChromeOS. Perhaps they&#8217;re developing a stripped down version of ChromeOS for this product to save on battery life. At this point, we have to just wait and see. Hopefully they&#8217;ll be announcing the developer version in the next few months.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep my human operated car thank you. Proper training and skill development have made it safer. I don&#8217;t want a logic engine deciding if I have a higher chance of survival going in the ditch or hitting the deer in the road.</p>
<p>Needs more skydiving hype.</p>
<p>Make big plastic-rimmed versions, and massive aviator-style sunglass versions, and we&#8217;re set.</p>
<p>Make a version in the shape of colored contact lens and then we&#8217;re set.</p>
<p>How would you power them?</p>
<p>Could be a wireless power transmitter you put in your pocket.  As close as possible to your gonads so they get the most out of the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how jazzed I would be to wear any kind of RF transmitting device (even bluetooth 4.0) right against my skull all day. Is early adoption worth brain cancer?</p>
<p>Genuinely believe that this is a technological dead end. Simply can&#8217;t imagine people being excited to wear a thing on their head all day just to access glance-able information. It needs to be less intrusive than a HMD. Wearable computing will be a thing, but it will be through products like the Pebble Smartwatch (Which accomplishes many of the same glance-able tasks, but much less intrusively), not this Glass nonsense.</p>
<p>This Glass project just strikes me as another example of engineers coming up with an overly complicated solution because they&#8217;re detached from the reality of the relatively simple problem they&#8217;re trying to solve.</p>
<p>Translation: &#8220;We&#8217;ve no idea a) what to do with this or b) how to make money from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;.but it&#8217;s great marketing and PR for us, so we&#8217;ll keep dangling the carrot, while trying to manage expectation until it works itself out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s awesome. The possibilities for this sort of stuff are endless. I saw a video with someone&rsquo;s idea for Google Glass. He was monitoring his progress and &ldquo;accuracy&rdquo; of playing piano. We&rsquo;ll see some great stuff being done with it.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>Link to this amazing video please !?</p>
<p>Just had a giggle fit. Almost a Google fit, even.</p>
<p>Only if the glass had style&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>That would be awesome until <span class="caps">TSA</span> decided your Google Glass was a threat and takes you into a back room for a full cavity search.</p>
<p>This takes the data behind it to make it a reality, and if it could work on Glass, it could work on our smartphones today. There&rsquo;s no reason smartphones can&rsquo;t argument reality this good, except for the fact that no one ties together data this well.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think this is the first glimpse of the real UI: <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-it-feels/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/glass/start/how-it-feels/</a></p>
<p>Which to say, looks <span class="caps">FREAKING</span> <span class="caps">AMAZING</span>.</p>
<p>Looks a lot like Google Now. Great UI.</p>
<p>Yes, the simulation looks very good&hellip;</p>
<p>Much better than I anticipated. Good work Google.</p>
<p>Makes it seem like it&rsquo;s just a <span class="caps">POV</span> helmet cam type device.  It&rsquo;ll be disappointing if this thing doesn&rsquo;t ship with some augmented reality software too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ok Glass, what&rsquo;s around me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have you learned nothing from Colonial Marines?</p>
<p>Wow, that it&acute;s pretty cool. A new era of home made porn just started.</p>
<p><span class="caps">POV</span> like never before!</p>
<p>Broken glass everywhere</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/300px-Grandmaster_Flash_and_The_Furious_Five.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Doggy style <span class="caps">POV</span> is gonna get a huge upgrade.</p>
<p>And also a new era of watching porn at home (or not).</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this will be the Glass commercial, because it makes you want to buy it instantly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure about that. Personally, it doesn&#8217;t look very appealing at all.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re a hater, all you do it hate.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of things I like. I just don&rsquo;t feel obligated to go around talking about it.</p>
<p>Hate hate, hooray!</p>
<p>- MikehMike01</p>
<p>It looks appearing, but has to work as advertised and battery life needs to be decent to make this mass-market.</p>
<p>Ok, I agree there are doubts.</p>
<p>But when watching this video for the first time, you don&rsquo;t get that warm feeling of how awesome would it be to re watch certain pleasant experiences from your life in the most realistic perspective again or sharing them with people who can&rsquo;t be around you at the time, then.. Sounds corny, but you aren&rsquo;t human enough.</p>

<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t even give me for that, because I have!</p>
<p>Yeah, my 18th birthday isn&rsquo;t for few more months. That kinda sucks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the same boat and applied anyway, just made sure to change the birthday on my Google account. If I fly to a convention across the country ready to hand them $1500, they are not going to turn me away. Not to mention the odds of being chosen are practically nothing. Apply, and then worry about what you are going to do if you actually get chosen.</p>
<p>Looks great and futuristic but I&rsquo;m still not convinced that wearable tech (and especially glasses)  are the future. Now, if they were corneal implants&hellip; :D</p>
<p>One will inevitably lead to the other, there are contact lens displays already in development, add bone conduction sound in a subdermial level and we&rsquo;ll all wish to have born a few decades later.</p>
<p>Exactly. The general public isn&rsquo;t going to start strapping things to their face to record everything they see, it has to be a lot more compact and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>I disagree. I would wear this everywhere.</p>
<p>Now I want one. Pity I don&rsquo;t have $1499 to spare.</p>
<p>Any clue on what the price will be for the retail device?</p>
<p>Also, for us poor bespectacled bastards, how cool would it be if they could fill up the rest of the space in the &lsquo;glasses&rsquo; with actual glass/ plastic according to the numbers of the wearer?</p>
<p>On the &ldquo;what it does&rdquo; tab they show attached sunglasses.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure the same can be done with corrective lenses.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TIL</span> you can use Hashtags on Google+</p>
<p>Welcome to 2011.</p>
<p>Wait, so the winner of this contest gets to pay $1500?</p>
<p>Yes. And Google will drown in applicants. I&rsquo;d consider it if it was available in Europe.</p>
<p>This IS Soviet Russia after all&hellip;</p>
<p>I cannot wait to get my hands on one. I only hope that when it&rsquo;s released to the wider general public, it&rsquo;ll be a <strong>lot</strong> cheaper.</p>
<p>Google have said that the first units designed for regular consumers will be about the cost of a smartphone. The high price tag is just to make sure only those that <em>really</em> want it apply, I think.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s how Google operate.  The high cost will simply be because they&rsquo;re still manufacturing small numbers or even prototypes and as a result production costs are higher than when they&rsquo;re mass-produced.</p>
<p>Smartphones can be expensive.</p>
<p>Luckily not 1500 expensive&hellip;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to have a pair. Gotta wait until next year though, I wonder how much they will be priced once available to consumers? I would give up upgrading my phone next year to use the money to get em. I just wonder how data works on them? Am I going to have to pay for a data plan with them? I already pay a lot a month for my phone so I wouldn&#8217;t want to pay for another data plan. I understand the use of WiFi but WiFi ain&#8217;t everywhere, well not in the UK anyway. Wait and see I guess.</p>
<p>Tethering with your phone would be an option, but battery life.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, tether with your phone. Yea battery might be an issue but it&#8217;s better then paying for another data plan.</p>
<p>more likely batter on the specs themselves is going to be an issue far more quickly than in your headset..</p>
<p>Well, if the X device focuses on battery life like rumors suggest, and we get some of that yummy <span class="caps">RAZR</span> <span class="caps">MAXX</span> esque longetivity, I&rsquo;ll tether gladly :)</p>
<p>pair of what? It is one glass.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same as saying &#8220;A pair of trousers&#8221; one there is only one.</p>
<p>*When there is only one</p>
<p>You have a pair of trouser legs.  There are two of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those things you&rsquo;re used to being referred to as a pair. Though I&rsquo;ve never understood why the name is plural; it&rsquo;s not like you ever use <strong>one pant</strong>&hellip;</p>
<p>Here in the UK, we say &#8220;a pair of trousers&#8221; and we mean one not two. We also say &#8220;Can&#8217;t wait to get a pair of these&#8221; also referencing one single item. It may be wrong to say it that way, as we all know a &#8220;pair&#8221; means &#8220;two&#8221;. This is how it used here though, I&#8217;m not sure if in the US it&#8217;s the same or not.</p>
<p>Google is here for you all:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pair_of_pants" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pair_of_pants</a></p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m here in the UK with you</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the UK, we say &ldquo;pair of pants&rdquo;.  This is because it has 2 pant legs, pretty simple.  In the same way, a &ldquo;pair of glasses&rdquo; describes an item with 2 glass lenses.  This has one display, which is it is called Google Glass and not Google Glasses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a pair of glasses. You don&rsquo;t say hand me my glass. You say hand me my glasses.</p>
<p>But you will say hand me my Glass, not Glasses.</p>
<p>A #ifihadwood campaign would be more suitable for the the main purpose of this.</p>
<p>I give these things a year before they are effectively banned by police/government. They simply will create too many accountability problems for them, although they&rsquo;ll justify the bans on &ldquo;public safety&rdquo; grounds.</p>
<p>On the other hand think about how much info the government will be able to get on people just by sending one of those warrantless <span class="caps">ECPA</span> requests.</p>
<p>Do you really think anyone doing any sort of illegal clandestine work is gonna be recording it to post on a social network?</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;ll get very little in intelligence, while at the same time You Tube will be awash in videos of numbnut cops beating people up and brain-dead bureaucrats harassing individual citizens.  It won&rsquo;t take long before these things are determined to be a menace to the public welfare.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be long before malware on a tethered smartphone can spy on whatever that person is seeing. Creepy.</p>
<p>Everything you see&hellip; instantly uploaded to Google+.</p>
<p>Everything.</p>
<p>Everything that you see&hellip; that you choose to upload&hellip; instantly uploaded to Google+</p>
<p>Fixed for you.</p>
<p>Well no you didn&rsquo;t fix it. You ruined my hyperbole.</p>
<p>According to those photos I&rsquo;m not attractive enough to apply :-/</p>
<p>How can you not? Look how happy they are.</p>
<p>Enter a competition for the chance to pay $1,500? That&rsquo;s&hellip; innovative.</p>
<p>you can spin it all the way you want. If Apple would say &ldquo;iPhone 6, one year earlier for $1000 to 50 people, apply now&rdquo; &ndash; they&rsquo;d get thousands of applicants.<br />
They don&rsquo;t apply to pay. They apply to be able to buy a product.<br />
But you know that.</p>
<p>Yay, a defensive Google fan&hellip; What exactly did I spin? I literally described the conditions of the contest.</p>
<p>They never claimed to invent the &ldquo;special reservation&rdquo; concept though.</p>
<p>First time I&rsquo;d heard of a competition like this.</p>
<p>Apparently it&#8217;s quite a common thing with shoes as well. A coworker of mine got all excited at work the other day because he won a contest for a pair of rare shoes. Apparently, he didn&#8217;t actually win the shoes, but he won the right to <span class="caps">BUY</span> the $600 pair of shoes.</p>
<p>I was so psyched to enter this until I read the full details &ndash; I still entered anyway, by chance that I happen to magically come across $1500&hellip;</p>
<p>Good luck, man! If you do win without being able to find the funds, you could probably sell the pre-order opportunity for a tidy profit :)</p>
<p>I can forgive that, since you&rsquo;re getting early access, but needing to travel to pick it up is ridiculous.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the laziest competition ever. Hey, I wonder if those are the T&amp;Cs for all those &ldquo;win an iPad&rdquo; banners knocking around the internet&hellip; :)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a convention, though. They want to make it a big deal and teach you things.</p>
<p>Is it just me or does the on-board camera look to be refocusing quite a lot?</p>
<p>So does the actual display allow you to change the focus distance? My eyes are getting older and I can not focus on something an inch from my eyeball.</p>
<p>will this be made in <span class="caps">USA</span> like that Q Ball?</p>
<p>If only I was a barista!</p>
<p>I think that Glass is an amazing idea, but they keep promoting it as an adventure-type device. How many of us actually go skydiving, fly planes and do acrobatics on a regular basis? Most of us go to work, go home, play our preferred console and then go to bed, which is why I&rsquo;m having a hard time finding the real world use for this.</p>
<p>I do see this as being something more suitable for businesses (video chat-trouble shooting, possible QR Scanners for shipping, maps for delivery people, etc&hellip;) but because those ad spots would be rather bland, I cant imagine they&rsquo;ll market it as such.</p>
<p>If I did, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t wear a $1500 device on my head while doing these things.</p>
<p>Did you not see the pictures of them bending? they are fairly durable.</p>
<p>The Google bullshit machine goes into overdrive.</p>
<p>U mad bro?</p>
<p>Get over yourself. Google&rsquo;s execution of Google products has been dismal to this point. U delusional bro?</p>
<p>yeah, he mad bro</p>
<p>AS I am not living in <span class="caps">USA</span> and do not have the slightest/remotest chance to participate here are my things:</p>
<p>#ifihadglass I would glue it on my motorcycle helmet and ride to the end of the world.<br />
#ifihadglass I would strap it on a Crash Test Dummy and&hellip; test.<br />
#ifihadglass I would strap it on my dog and play fetch with him&hellip; the dog.<br />
#ifihadglass I would sleep with it&hellip; just to see if monsters do come out at night.</p>
<p>Feel free to peruse my phrases&hellip; and enjoy the prize&hellip; they are winners.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for bold, creative individuals <strong>with lots of disposable cash</strong> to join us&hellip;</p>
<p>Seriously, this could be the next big thing or the next biggest yawn.</p>
<p>My gut says it&rsquo;s going to be the latter&hellip;</p>
<p>They probably want to control who gets them and what will they do with them. And of course not handing them to some manufacturer to disect and study them.</p>
<p>I think the limited beta exclusivity feature is excellent, if the pacing will be done right and product creates alot of hype this way, then bam &ndash; gets shipped to market at the right point.</p>
<p>My gut too. What&rsquo;s the benefit over having a smartphone when it comes to using it as a camera? Sure, if you&rsquo;re flying a plane, it may be more useful, but for those of us on the ground (and the air?) a smartphone or any device not attached to your head has the great feature of not needing to concentrate on what you&rsquo;re recording, keeping your eyes open to the rest of your surroundings. (That natural benefit of course applies to a device that may fit on your wrist&hellip;)</p>
<p>And yet it&rsquo;s capabilities for videos and pictures take up the vast majority of usage scenarios in the video, even to the point of simply showing a first person view. That&rsquo;s not the future. That&rsquo;s the past, except in slightly more inconvenient hardware form made to seem futuristic because Star Trek said it would be so.</p>
<p>Now texting on the other hand, while not likely to set some geek&rsquo;s hearts on fire, seems to be more useful and holds more potential. Maps too. Anything where location and identification can come into play. But as the Jellyfish card shows, Google has to provide a way of giving more information. Because once again, what&rsquo;s e point of showing a picture of a Jellyfish (that the actor had to ask for btw, it didn&rsquo;t identify it on its own&hellip;) with less information than what will be on the display at the aquarium.</p>
<p>Early days yet, but this is starting to remind me of Buzz. But maybe we should keep an eye on Google Now to see how success Glass will be. Because this should be a Google Now device, just like an iWatch should be a Siri device. Two pieces of software that started elsewhere, but fit best in theory on wearable tech.</p>
<p>Agree with almost everything&hellip; except that an iWatch should also be a &ldquo;Google Now&rdquo; device.</p>
<p>Hopefully the features of this thing become more useful. Early days yet though and Google isn&rsquo;t Microsoft, giving me some hope that this may actually be a good product in 6 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Bono will get one, these glasses are so Bono material</p>
<p>#ifihadglass i would probably bump into even more things than i already do.</p>
<p>I wonder whether the display is placed so far away in your field of view that you won&rsquo;t get annoyed by the fact that it&rsquo;s monocular.</p>
<p>&hellip;and they would have gotten away with it, were it not for Google.</p>
<p>Or a spellchecker.</p>
<p>He must be using IE because Chrome and Firefox would of caught those spelling errors</p>
<p>and then you start using &ldquo;of&rdquo; for &ldquo;have&rdquo;</p>
<p>The irony&hellip;</p>
<p>Given that it wasn&rsquo;t a spelling mistake I fail to see the irony.</p>
<p>Office 2013 and Windows 8 integrated spell check, which works in IE, also underline grammar errors and things like they/their.</p>
<p>And those meddling kids&hellip;</p>
<p>His horrible grammar, overuse of commas, and the fact that he is an early &ldquo;adapter&rdquo; rather than adopter should have tipped some people off that this guy didn&rsquo;t really amaze Google enough to get a pair&hellip;</p>
<p>lawlz</p>
<p>God love early adapters.  Where would we be without them?</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://saundby.com/atari7800mod/images/vidadapt1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And yet there were people willing to give him thousands of dollars&hellip;</p>
<p>Common sense, lacking it is.</p>
<p>The internet seems to amplify the lack of common sense among many folks.</p>
<p>I would sell it and get a new car. #ifihadglass</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>I&rsquo;ve been selected as an early adapter</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since he is the adapter, do i have to wear him to fully experience Project Glass?</p>
<p>For one i can&rsquo;t believe people would be willing to pay this much for them and secondly i thought it was a competition lol, instead you still have to pay for them, somehow i don&rsquo;t feel sad this <strong>competition</strong> is US only lol.</p>
<p>Who are these dummies that love overbidding on soon to be readily available commercial devices?</p>
<p>Oh noes, I can&#8217;t get an iPhone 5 for 3 more weeks? Better drop a couple thousand on one!</p>
<p>I get the impression it&#8217;s people living beyond their means.</p>
<p>Those people are gamblers.</p>
<p>Google should auction one of the real ones for charity.</p>
<p>They could&rsquo;t even make a video ?</p>
<p>did they need to?</p>
<p>Yeap, would have been nice to see one</p>
<p><img title="no time" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdf4gjB0J91rwcc6bo1_500.gif" alt="no time" /></p>
<p>Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell played.</p>
<p><strong>Dude cmon, this is a neat idea. Take a day or two and whip something together.</strong></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/sQn0inv.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>The contest restricts videos to 15 sec.</p>
<p>I know to implement this would take a long time and lots of hard work, but it is bloody exciting nonetheless.</p>
<p>Woah woah woah.  There need not be any bloodshed for some AR implementation.  Let&rsquo;s all just calm down.</p>
<p>you walk towards the ridiculously long line for the <span class="caps">TSA</span> asshats to scan/frisk you and the glasses tell you which line is quickest!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d probably confiscate your expensive techno-goggles if you tried to wear them through security.</p>
<p>And shouldn&rsquo;t they? He&rsquo;s obviously a terrorist trying to record potential weak points or holes in security.</p>
<p>He should probably be detained for questioning.</p>
<p>Or tell you which cavities they are going to search.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand the point of the parking garage capacity card. It seems like it would lead to incredibly distracted driving, especially when it would be much easier to simply place the capacity of each parking garage on the sign itself, which is something I believe they already do at <span class="caps">PDX</span>.</p>
<p>These kinds of things are to be expected. Glass presents an entirely new platform for application development.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for google glasses to become a consumer reality.  So many applications.  It&rsquo;s not so much that I think we&rsquo;ve arrived, more that I really, really like where we&rsquo;re headed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be too complicated for the average user. <span class="caps">IOS</span> users cant even handle a back button on their phone and you expect them to use this?</p>
<p>It runs on Android so I&#8217;m sure iOS users don&#8217;t want it, if they do they&#8217;d have to admit Android isn&#8217;t bad.</p>
<p>Most apps that need a back button have one only when needed. Why should it take up space on the screen when you&rsquo;re doing something else (referring to software back button in Android 4.0+)</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trolling&hellip; Dont waste your keystrokes.</p>
<p>Oh I know, but it was just too easy to counter.</p>
<p>He definitely was trolling, but to be honest, a back button on the bottom left is way more comfortable than the top left. It&rsquo;s the one thing I worry about in terms of usability for Ubuntu Touch.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait until something like <span class="caps">GPS</span> works indoors. Great ideas but is indoor way-finding even possible with current consumer tech?</p>
<p>Yes, but it takes a lot of work.  Basically you need to walk around and record the signal strengths of each individual wireless hotspot in a given location.  You&rsquo;ll need to do this multiple times since the reception fluctuates.  Once you have enough to create a reliable range of signal strengths for that hotspot, you can use that to track where someone is.  The more hotspots they&rsquo;re in range of, the more accurate the location will become.</p>
<p>Example:  Hotspot A, B, and C all overlap near baggage claim 1 but also overlap near baggage claim 2.  Hotspot A is above baggage claim 1, B is near where people sit down a few feet away, and C is above baggage claim 2.  Using the current strength of the networks you can determine where they are.  If A is the strongest, they are likely by baggage claim 1.  You can then either triangulate for exact location(expensive processor wise) or check a pre-made database of likely spots given hotspots A,B,&amp;C at various signal strengths for a good enough location(larger database required).</p>
<p>(My last year of college a group in my capstone class presented a working prototype Android app they had made of this concept as a way to navigate students to different classrooms on different floors in a building.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aeroscout.com/" target="_blank">http://www.aeroscout.com/</a> does exactly this.</p>
<p>Anything is possible with enough work. Assuming someone bright enough couldn&rsquo;t pull it off with just secondary sensors on your phone, you could always pull it off in an AR (augmented reality) type fashion.</p>
<p>Google is already providing maps of various buildings (Malls, Airports, Arenas), the next step would be integration with an AR app such as City Lens on the Nokia WP devices. Hold your phone up in an airport and let it point its way towards whatever terminal or shop you need. With the AR app open it can scan for store signage or other signs to help figure out where you are so that it can tell you where to go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with enough work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that rules out airports.</p>
<p>Yeah definitely, but I was specifically talking about current generation or near future consumer grade tech. We have the maps but not sure all the way finding tech is working together to do this yet and Google Glass doesn&rsquo;t have an internal radio but it does have <span class="caps">GPS</span>, curious if they plan on mapping WiFi points in airports and somehow getting that info through the phone to the glasses?</p>
<p>They could but depending on the airport, wifi might be spotty and some public places simply don&rsquo;t offer wifi or enough wifi to allow you correctly map an area.</p>
<p>My idea would allow it to work at any public venue, wifi or not and could be done now. Use the camera on your phone/Google Glasses to read any store signs and that allows the servers to place where you&rsquo;re at in the venue. That combined with mapping data that&rsquo;s already being gathered and it would be relatively easy to have the app start pointing you in the right direction.</p>
<p>I had already done an Airport Flight Check-In Mockup last year.</p>
<p><img title="Airport Flight Check-in Mockup" src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/10785/screenshots/637864/plane.jpg" alt="Airport Flight Check-in Mockup" /></p>
<p><a href="http://drbl.in/eBUG" target="_blank">http://drbl.in/eBUG</a></p>
<p>But how do you press the buttons???</p>
<p>Long blink or double blink.</p>
<p>Right blink or left blink? Wink?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on which ever side you wear them. And yes, it&rsquo;s really long wink to cancel, blink twice to confirm.</p>
<p>Wait, you&rsquo;re serious. I just read some more about Glass and it seems blinks will be used. That&rsquo;s quite possibly the worst input idea I&rsquo;ve ever heard. Using a natural, sometimes involuntary body function to issue commands? And a long blink? They want you to close your eyes (even one eye is still bad) to do something? I hope that the keyboard projector thing pans out.</p>
<p>Everyone looking into nothing while blinking and winking nonstop, great future</p>
<p><img title="funny" src="http://http://24.media.tumblr.com/0d81c9c43084124aef92ea83bb988fe3/tumblr_mijo7kOshl1rdqbfro1_500.gif" alt="funny" /></p>
<p>&hellip;Then random fit girl thinks you&rsquo;re winking at her and tries to backhand you to the floor.</p>
<p>They should absolutely give glass to every company out there.  If they get started now, they can have applications like this ready to go.  Imagine the wealth of information if airports, city governments, malls, and huge stores had apps ready to go right when glass goes on sale.</p>
<p>I imagine they have already done this with big developers, they are almost definitely doing it with hardware partners ie. glasses manufacturers.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t really want these things running &ldquo;apps&rdquo; per se.  I want google to get all this information and then present it in a simple way without ever running an app on my glass.</p>
<p>Ideally it should just recognize when you&rsquo;ve arrived at a location for which it has information and then ask you if you&rsquo;d like it to present that information, ie: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve arrived at <span class="caps">LAX</span>, would you like me to guide you to your connecting gate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it runs apps you&rsquo;ve blown it&hellip;</p>
<p>Only thing wrong with their mockups is this can only be in the &lsquo;corner of your eye&rsquo; essentially. So an overlay over what you see isn&rsquo;t really possible.</p>
<p>They <span class="caps">COULD</span> turn the camera on and overlay the indicators over that image though.</p>
<p>true virtual reality is sooo exciting, you are a simpleton if you cannot imagine the possibilities.</p>
<p>I suppose this is exciting if it&rsquo;s possible with Glass. None of Google&rsquo;s own software shown in the video from a week or two ago seems to indicate that Glass can do this sort of augmented reality. Google&rsquo;s included software is reliant on location at most. Not to say that&rsquo;s the limit of Glass, but I think Google would have implemented something of the sort if it could.</p>
<p>If it has a compass or can pull data from the phones compass then this should be possible.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is what Glass is going to be used for, at least not now. When this can be thrown into actual lenses for normal glasses, that is when things are going to get exciting (as if Glass is not already super exciting&hellip;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that Google wouldn&rsquo;t mine taking $1500 or more from a large corporation. If anything, they might be able to get more than one pair of Glass.</p>
<p>I kind of want to fly JetBlue from now on just to support this.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;s allowed. Corporations are people too, remember?<br />
And if JetBlue wins a pair, all 11,797 employees get a trip to <span class="caps">NYC</span>/LA/SF!</p>
<p>Show the amount of parking available as you drive past? Nice idea, but these things will be legislated off of your face before that can happen. There is no way they won&#8217;t be considered a driver distraction!</p>
<p>I have a 10" tablet mount in my car.  The Tesla Model S has a large tablet mounted in the dashboard from the factory.</p>
<p>Both of those things are perfectly legal, and yet, Glass is safer and less of a distraction than both of them.</p>
<p>No. You mean to tell me something in your field of vision is less distracting that a screen you have to consciously turn your head to view?</p>
<p>Yes.  Unequivably, Glass will be less distracting to someone driving a car.</p>
<p>The way the display on Glass is positioned, it&rsquo;s basically out of your field of view.  You have to glance up and to the right to see the display.  When accidents happens in an instant, any savings in time makes a big difference.  So you&rsquo;re talking about the time it takes to move your gaze slightly versus actually turning your head and moving your eyes a much farther distance relative to Glass.</p>
<p>That, and Glass content is specifically designed to be glancable, bite-sized content, unlike what you might find in a smartphone or tablet app.  Glass can be looked at and processed much faster.</p>
<p>I should hope that it&rsquo;s not hard to understand. Why should you have to look <span class="caps">AWAY</span> from what you&rsquo;re doing? Surely it&rsquo;s safer to have the display in the back seat, since you have to consciously turn your head to view it, right?</p>
<p>/facepalm</p>
<p>You should have put a /s there, people are getting confused.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about the power outlet mockup, specifically &ndash; isn&rsquo;t the glass only in your upper-right field of view? Surely you couldn&rsquo;t just have a huge overlay in your field of vision&hellip; I guess it could just overlay it on a video of what you&rsquo;re seeing and stick that in the little upper right-hand display box?</p>
<p>Just be sure to completely power down and securely stow your Glass prior to takeoff and landing. :)</p>
<p>So, that woman has an outlet between her legs?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s been pointed out by now &ndash; but putting the information <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> IN <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">MIDDLE</span> OF <span class="caps">THE</span> USER&rsquo;S <span class="caps">VIEW</span> is a bad idea. That&rsquo;s why the real Google Glass puts it in the upper right, out of the way.</p>
<p>JetBlue needs to focus more energy on making sure their pilots aren&rsquo;t drunk, losing luggage and not imprisoning passengers on airlines when there are weather delays. When they have those issues worked out, then they can start working on the other &lsquo;tech&rsquo; bs.</p>
<p>I think its a huge step forward into the future. If your a fan of google glass join the discussion in.<br /><a href="http://googleglassforum.org" target="_blank">http://googleglassforum.org</a></p>
<p>Google Glass: enabling great, disruption-free play time for Dads everywhere.</p>
<p>Until your kid pulls them out and throws them on the floor while playing.</p>
<p>Or  &#8211; if like mine &#8211; tries to put them in his mouth.</p>
<p>Oops there goes $1500.</p>
<p>for developers, yes.</p>
<p>This will never cost &lt;$500 even when mass produced, especially with it has mobile data.</p>
<p>I have no idea how much it will cost, the price you mentioned however, is specifically for developers, that&#8217;s all I was saying. I am aware that once released, it will cost a pretty penny to early adopters.</p>
<p>Though I did sound a bit mean in my response, and so I do apologise for that.</p>
<p>Kinda like how 1.2ghz dual-core computer with 1GB ram will never cost less than $500. And yet, the Galaxy Nexus is precisely that. My phone costs $350, and has more processing power than my computer had 5 years ago. Oh, and it&#8217;s overall dimensions are smaller than my computer&#8217;s mouse. Just yesterday Intel had a story about how processing power is getting to the point where, by 2020, it&#8217;ll be &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google Glass isn&#8217;t pie-in-the-sky. It&#8217;s inevitable.</p>
<p>yay! true innovation!!</p>
<p>Actually&#8230; no. I have seen this plenty of times in the movies, yes they are not functional, but the idea and design are stolen from fiction.</p>
<p>And how many cool things weren&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Most ideas and start as science fiction and then somebody works on it and it becomes science fact.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s called &#8216;inspired by&#8217; not &#8216;true innovation&#8217;.</p>
<p>The innovations are what get you to the point where you can make the science fiction possible. Someone dreaming of a fantastic future does not detract from the pleasure of reaching it.</p>
<p>Thats the problem with the world, everyone believes the innovation is in the idea.  People were drawing sketches of flying machines 400 years ago.  It took the hard work and dedication of many individuals to create the first plane.  Then the hardwok and dedication of many more to create safe air travel for the average person.  THAT is innovation.</p>
<p>I find it ridiculous, immoral and insulting that 500,000 patents are granted every year, more than a few of them for nothing more than an idea of how something could work.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re mixing up &#8220;innovation&#8221; and &#8220;invention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually&#8230;most of the components they&#8217;ve revealed it uses cost &lt;$400 when assembled into a device today.  It could easily cost &lt;$500 when it launches for consumers.</p>
<p>You know prescription glasses cost a couple hundred bucks on the low-end, right? A couple to a few hundred bucks maybe a lot of money to a young adult or a teen, but to someone with even an entry-level job that isn&#8217;t that much. Lots of things we don&#8217;t buy very often cost that much: appliances, computers, televisions, phones, athletic equipment, etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;if you don&#8217;t have enough money, you can&#8217;t buy something&#8221;  Thanks, BobKozik for teaching us that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that&#8217;s common sense but how many people on welfare have you seen with an expensive smartphone and designer glasses.</p>
<p>How dare you! It&#8217;s the rich people&#8217;s fault for not sharing their money!</p>
<p>i really hope your not serious</p>
<p>I think you didn&#8217;t read the &#8220;/s&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor people need to virtual reality too!</p>
<p>Never is a long time.</p>
<blockquote>This will never cost &lt;$500 even when mass produced, especially with it has mobile data.</blockquote>
<p>Seems a bit premature, especially since we&#8217;re all carrying extremely impressive computers around in our pockets. Who knows what the future holds :)</p>
<p>Humm, if you remove the 5&quot; display and quad core processor, there is little left that makes a mobile phone expensive.</p>
<p>Bluetooth enable. Internet thru phone. Solved.</p>
<p>My youngest has already gone full-wishbone on 2 pairs of my sunglasses, and he&#8217;s barely a year old.  I won&#8217;t be able to go within 10 feet of him wearing $1500 on my face&#8230; he&#8217;s a swift little devil. :-)</p>
<p>It should come with a warning, &#8220;If your kids are under 5, don&#8217;t pick them up while wearing Google Glass.&#8221; ;-)</p>
<p>Or cat. The little f*ckers like to poke you in the face.</p>
<p>$1500 was the price of hand-made prototype, not the final product.</p>
<p>Dads are wearing regular glasses when playing with kids today, nothing new.</p>
<p>I agree. Google glass is the next big thing. Endless what they can do with it. Nothing better than to big calls on the go with voice without touching the phone and take photos without the phone or camera process too.</p>
<p>Except that it is stupid and pointless. This will never be a mass market product. What would anyone use it for?</p>
<p>I would like to raise money and pass them out to pedestrians crossing the street toward me, eyes fixed on a navel-high smartphone, blissfully ignorant that they are about slam into me and/or force me into traffic to avoid them.</p>

<p>Really if this functions as an extension to a phone, like bluetooth headset, it could be pretty sweet&#8230;.</p>

<blockquote>Basically what you said is exactly what people said about bluetooth headsets a few years back</blockquote>
<p><strong>AND THEY WERE TOTALLY RIGHT.</strong></p>
<p>God I hate when I see douches with those stupid things in their ears 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Yet they are a mass market product and people do use them constantly. Google Glass can offer the same features as bluetooth headsets plus literally hundreds of other uses.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite possible Google Glass will fail as a product, but I think it&#8217;s clear that wearable computing is a trend that will continue to grow.</p>
<p>They are not mass market. Seeing people wearing headsets is still rare enough it is noticeable (i.e. look at that douche)</p>
<p>I predict one of the first apps out for it will be a scouter app to give you the power level of your opponents.  That would make it worth it&#8217;s weight in gold.</p>
<p>But seriously, what FPS gamer wouldn&#8217;t love going around with a personal hud?</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re talking. I haven&#8217;t seen anyone talking about the possibilities of Glass as a second screen while gaming, but it would be <em>ideal</em> for a great many things.</p>
<p>Chat, please do not think of us to be son unimaginative as you. Keep using your Palm V :P</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who uses a smart phone for anything? Ok, it can do that.</p>
<p>I heard people saying that exact thing about iPad. And it was for a good 9 months a totally useless toy&#8230; but then&#8230;</p>
<p>Nothing funnier to see geeky geek crashes and bumps into things while he is busy staring at his glasses. &#8220;Ops sorry, I swear my eyes are perfectly fine&#8221; &#8220;Then why you wearing glasses?&#8221; &#8220;Its for&#8230;NVM.&#8221; Silly.</p>
<p>Google Glass:  For getting your geek on after an argument with your imaginary girlfriend.</p>
<p>Girls love geeks.</p>
<p>The glasses were &#8220;balky&#8221;? As in Perfect Strangers Balky? I don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>Maybe the software &#8220;balks&#8221; when you try to do anything.</p>
<p>If the HUD doesn&#8217;t have a red hue, scroll 6510 assembly language and assess the size and threat of everybody around me, I don&#8217;t want them.</p>
<p>Sounds like a cool app to make once they release an APK for these</p>
<p>It exists on iOS already, it&#8217;s called CyborgVision :)</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous!&#8221;</p>
<p>laughtrack.mp3</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to see what this becomes!  Those who knock it as just a hands free camera should realize the possibilities are as endless as your imagination.  You have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>You sound like my 5th grade teacher. But she was wrong about me. I amounted to nothing.</p>
<p>Way to redeem your &#8220;Perfect Strangers&#8221; pop cultural reference from above.  That show choked the poulet.  recommended</p>
<p>Man, this is exciting. Google is doing some sweet stuff. Too bad they had to get into everything else.</p>
<p>Great innovation on Google&#8217;s part. Hope this leads to some cool tech stuff.</p>
<p>As much as I love Google and hope that they do succeed, chances are they won&#8217;t. There are too many device usability problems to be solved, and we know Google isn&#8217;t that good at it. I mean, look at what they did with the Nexus Q.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re still working on the Q. Give them some time. They <i>did</i> postpone the launch to give it some real functionality. Let&#8217;s see what it can do when it launches.</p>
<p>What? Are you stupid? You think that because they put out one experimental product that didn&#8217;t immediately sell millions of units that they are unable to make this work?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this will sell well. Its a nice idea but just don&#8217;t see it selling well.</p>
<p>It could all boil down to how much this will cost. I&#8217;m personally eager to experience the display for myself, but I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d need to use them regularly.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If I would even need to use them at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>ya that&#8217;s the thing&#8230; even i was thinking- would you like to use this regularly? I mean with phones you can use them and still be quite aware of the environment around you. With the glass (idea), once you are using it, your basic primary sense will be concentrated to an output of the HUD. This will be nice and cool at first but eventually people will be taking it off and doing stuff and putting back on and eventually the purpose of the device will be defeated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read that the display sin&#8217;t too obtrusive, it&#8217;s fairly high up in your field of vision. Regardless of usecases, I still think this is an awesome concept.</p>
<p>These things likely have utility in law enforcement. Cops having pics and info sent straight to them,  without having to look down at a phone, then up at a suspect. Chasing a suspect and having a map of your surroundings. Videoing crimes etc.  Think Robocop without all the armour and machine pistol.</p>
<p>Actually maybe Google should just make some armour and machine pistols.</p>
<p>As a bespectacled man, I already spend 16 hours a day looking through lenses. A large percentage of that time is also spent looking at screens, both large and pocket-sized.</p>
<p>If I could spend less time pulling a screen out of my pocket and instead have that information on the lenses I already wear on my head, I&#8217;d happily spend $500 or more on it.</p>
<p>Obviously there needs to be an easy way to turn the display on and off, and there will be a whole new learning curve when it comes to mobile device etiquette. But for those of us who already wear glasses, taking it on and off regularly isn&#8217;t a concern.</p>
<p>I am too and i understand where you are coming from. I guess it will have to be executed very well to be popular. I can only guess but from what i feel, glasses and contact lenses for that matter, which would act as some intermediary display, would require a lot of getting used to. A lot of people avoid normal specs even if they have low myopia. At some stage(depending on power) people accept it. These glasses maybe like that. If they end up empowering its user much more than what discomfort he has to face they will break ground else it won&#8217;t. I still feel it would be much better if it were used for specific tasks rather than if it tries to do a smartphone type thing but its just my opinion.</p>
<p>yea because this is clearly being released in retails very soon.  This is a developer only prototype.</p>
<p>I am skeptical about the idea of a half glass acting as a hud. It may have groundbreaking technology but would people want information all the time. Maybe it wont be intrusive too but yet it would be in the back of your mind.</p>
<p>I think there are some use scenarios for this:<br />
Sports real time stats<br />
Replacing a teleprompter.<br />
Stock ticker<br />
Real time translation spoken/written.</p>
<p>Why do you have to have it on all the time for it to be relevant? People put don their phones, their tablets and their PC&#8217;s.  Why can&#8217;t they take these off?</p>
<p>Ya i agree with that. If it leads to a device that is specific it has got more potential. If it sort of tries to replace the smartphone, i am not very positive about that. <br />
I would absolutely love a full on HUD  that covers your entire viewing angle. Think of what it will do to the movies or games. But ya it has to be done well.</p>
<blockquote> It may have groundbreaking technology but would people want information all the time[?]</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://getpebble.com/">Yes. Yes they do.</a></p>
<p>I imagine it can be turned off or removed&#8230;</p>
<p>sure it can. but if you keep putting it on and off, how is it better than a smartphone. I know its too early as a concept but i feel it will do far better for specific tasks(stock trading for example) than say try to do a smartphone ie be a primary communication device for the masses.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s handsfree! :D</p>
<p>Wait until Apple gets their hands on it, it will sell gazillion.</p>
<p>Possible, it depends on Google.  All the products Apple sells existed before, they just made them work properly.  I&#8217;m betting on Google on this one though.  Mainly because the CEO wants to do something great besides search.</p>
<p>Once the nail down the basic functionality, and get it out to a few people, it will get more exposure. Besides, once some normal people have it, they will show it off to their friends (and possibly let them try it), then those friends will decide if they want to buy it or not. As the price goes down, more people will decide to buy it.</p>
<p>Also, if they open it up to developers, we could see a lot more uses for it.</p>
<p>Once THEY nail down&#8230;.</p>
<p>I think this would be awesome for cycling. If someone built an app that challenges you to &#8220;race yourself&#8221;, you&#8217;d be able to keep track of your progress through a circuit based on GPS location. You could see your time, distance, pace, and perhaps the rear-end of a cyclist if you&#8217;re lagging your time. I&#8217;d buy it.</p>
<p>Reminds me of &#8220;ghost mode&#8221; on Wip3out.</p>
<p>So much yes.</p>
<p>Or in Mario Kart, but yeah, great idea.</p>
<p>Or imagine a Gran Turismo-like display showing the racing line and braking zones.</p>
<p>Usually <em>grass</em> or <em>walls</em> or <em>oncoming traffic</em> are the usual braking zones in real life cycling.</p>
<p>He <i>might</i> have meant for nascar or something&#8230;</p>
<p>Indeed I was referring to track-driving. As far as real-world applicationos, a head-mounted HUD could display your driving directions directly on the road in front of you, similar to the racing-line oer lays you find in racing games.</p>
<p>definitely, there are specific use cases for Google glasses like cycling (sports) or even combat (military)</p>
<p>Not just for cycling!</p>
<p>Runners could use that too&#8230;.as long as they fit snugly and don&#8217;t bounce around.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t even need to be just for cycling. I&#8217;d love it when walking to the store to track my time and progress and compare it over time. It&#8217;d be fantastic for all sorts of passive uses like that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just wondering how these devices will even reach retail. Will they license the technology out to partner OEMs or will it be an in-house project? Licensing to Luxottica would mean some pretty snazzy Oakleys are on the horizon.</p>
<p>Samsung has see-through flexible display panels now &#8211; they could part out the display to Sammy, and fit it in a pair of sunglasses. That would be incredible.</p>
<p>i dont think its at that stage yet.   Right now its just a prototype for developers. I think we&#8217;re yrs away from a retail product.</p>
<p>Perhaps Google is cutting their teeth in manufacturing on the Nexus Q to get ready for mass-producing these themselves?</p>
<p>Or if they licensed the technology, would they have it manufactured by a sunglass company or an electronics company?</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the Battery?</p>
<p>on the right hand side, it rests behind the right ear.</p>
<p>(That little chunky bit)</p>
<p>It is powered by the sound of children&#8217;s laughter, which is why that&#8217;s always the example they use when talking about the technology.</p>
<p>Better than children&#8217;s screams.</p>
<p>It runs on hype</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/06/vicglass.jpg" /></p>
<p>In my opinion if they can come up with a more or less functioning device in two years, they will pretty much transform our lives. When I&#8217;ve first seen Google Now at the I/O I thought &#8220;yeah, it&#8217;s pretty cool, but what else do you have?&#8221;, but having jelly bean on my phone, this thing is awesome! It navigates me to new places where I might want to go AUTOMATICALLY, tells me when I&#8217;d better be leaving to actually get there on time&#8230; if this technology is implemented in the glasses with two years of development and experience&#8230; oh boy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fascinating watching this technology develop.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll really be feasible for consumers for at least 3-5 years, but it&#8217;ll be really interesting to see how people work it into their every day lives.</p>
<p>In 10-15 years, will we be able to go to a Lenscrafters and order a pair of prescription glasses with a Google-powered HUD?</p>
<p>honestly i would lover that..also designer shades</p>
<p>Google will add a &#8220;Glasses&#8221; tab to their Play Store Devices.  You&#8217;ll be able to select your prescription, style, color and face width.</p>
<p>Honestly, I just want to see this rolled out as cheaply as possible as a driving HUD in my personal car.  I&#8217;m not expecting much &#8211; just my current speed as well as navigation notifications (left arrow, right arrow, etc)</p>
<p>Yeah, that would be pretty awesome.  Would also be nice to see the information of the cars around/in front of you, especially their current speed.</p>
<p>Of course, if Google has their way, we&#8217;ll all be inside self-driving cars anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t BMW already doing something similar to this?</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t even have maps working and you&#8217;re already asking for directions overlaid on reality?</p>
<p>Not gonna happen with that hardware. Even just the sensors necessary to make that work wouldn&#8217;t fit in there.</p>
<p>Ah, I thought he meant to have the display embedded in the windshield.</p>
<p>Every time I run across someone so full of doubt about the rapid pace of technological advances, I think to myself, where have these people been the last 10 years?</p>
<p>They developed a car that drives itself quite well, shit there is a human controlled robot/laboratory on Mars that has a battery that can power it for a decade, open you mind a bit.</p>
<p>All of the technology exist, packaging it into a wearable device is not <em>that</em> improbable.</p>
<p>Wearable computing devices are definitely the wave of the future.  Technology as fashion is a future inevitability. It may not end up looking anything like Google Glass but it will eventually be mainstream.  It may seem foreign and strange to us now, but for the next couple generations of kids the need to hold a gadget/phone in your hands will seem as foreign to them as Google Glass does to us now. Mark my words.</p>
<p>I see this being an accessory to your cell phone for the next 10-15 years. Only reason I say this is because I dont think its possible at the moment to cram everything you need into the frames. Not to mention the battery life would be pretty horrendous. Buying these glasses should be able to raplace a cell phone but also last at minimum 8 hrs and I dont think its possible right now. But like everyone else is saying, you have to start somewhere and I think they are doing a decent job so far.</p>
<p>Agree 100%.  This will be more of a hands-free replacement than a phone replacement.  By offloading all the radios and processing requirements to a bigger battery device in your pocket, they could really achieve long lasting performance.</p>
<p>This assumes you need to do the processing somewhere in your general vicinity. There&#8217;s no reason Glasses couldn&#8217;t go to an OnLive model where all the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, and the stuff you wear on your head only deals with I/O.</p>
<p>There is a reason: radio&#8217;s consume quite a lot of power. Even today&#8217;s smartphones won&#8217;t last a full day of continuous 3G transmission.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve already crammed all the components for a cell phone into the frames, the only question left is battery life. And I don&#8217;t think the battery needs to be as big as a cell phone battery simply because the screen is so much smaller and lower resolution.</p>
<p>I think Glass is one of the best arguments for a very large screened single device, instead of separate phones and tablets. One slim 6&quot; phone that can fit in the pocket and Glass for most on the go uses.</p>
<p>Google Glasses is to the future version of our digital vision what Windows CE circa 98 was to tablets.</p>
<p>A lot of vaporware, a lot of promise and a hell lot of a disappointment year over year over year over year&#8230;</p>
<p>Wake me up in 20 years when the next Apple-like company steals this idea from Google as if they didn&#8217;t matter at all and just builds the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; we are all craving for today.</p>
<p>Right, because google sucks at taking clunky implementations of products, and making them slick, simple, and useful.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be wild if Apple came out with the iGlasses tomorrow? :)</p>
<p>Really pullin for a lot of these concepts to succeed. There&#8217;s a large stigma surrounding TMI syndrome, but eventually the solution of &#8220;getting it out of the way&#8221; will be implemented.</p>
<p>So, can someone who has worn these confirm that the view through the glasses looks like the pictures they showed in the video? That question has been eating at me since the project was announced.<br />
(Brilliant marketing, actually).</p>
<p>So does anyone have a clue on what kind of technology stands behind google glass? Is it VRD? I, personally, would like it to be a VRD, because of it&#8217;s principle with laser beaming to retina. Best colors, best gamut and best resolution and no intermediary screens.</p>
<p>Oh come on &#8211; it&#8217;s new damned tech and extremely ambitious tech at that.<br />
Of course Gen 1 isn&#8217;t going to be the end-all/be-all.<br />
Just the size and weight are incredibly ambitious given battery, processing,storage requirements.</p>
<p>I wish the audio instantiator was &#8220;Glass powers &#8211; activate!&#8221;</p>
<p>One day we&#8217;ll have Google Contact  (as in lenses).<br />
And it will have both a camera and a projector.<br />
Possibly even a stun or killing beam weapon of some kind.<br />
The aliens are not going to know what hit them.<br />
We will be like gods!</p>
<p>That should be their marketing blurb.<br />
&#8220;Google Glass &#8211; Be like a god!&#8221;</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m in a room full of people and we&#8217;re all wearing these, then I yell, &#8220;Take a photo!!!&#8221; everyone in the room is gonna have a photo pop up, right?</p>
<p>Not likely. Probably set on a proximity based microphone.</p>
<p>The glass project reminds me of the Holoband. <br />
It&#8217;s the first step to the creation of the Cylon. <br />
You have been warned!</p>
<p>This thing will be huge, HUGE! For one reason and one reason only. Pornography. Think about it POV and Virtual Reality&#8230;</p>
<p>In the User Interface there needs to be text with the icons so that one can say &#8220;Glasses Weather&#8221; or &#8220;Glasses Maps Empire State Building&#8221; or &#8220;Glasses Dictation&#8221; or &#8220;Glasses email&#8221;.</p>
<p>$1500 dollars and only devs makes me sad. I really want this.</p>
<p>A consumer edition will come out soon enough.</p>
<p>Any time in the next 5 years will be suitable for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be willing to pay $900.1  for one.</p>
<p>Then you are fresh outta luck!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting for someone to tell me the killer use case that makes this thing interesting.</p>
<p>Playing Ubisoft&#8217;s Watchdogs in real life.</p>
<p>Any job that requires a worker/an employee to use both hands, and where additional information can be useful. E.g.:<br />
- Storage facilities that are not automated (display items to pick up/deposit)<br />
- Anyone driving (question whether it is vehicle-safe though)<br />
- Hotel maids (see which rooms need to be cleaned, and tick off the list)<br />
&#8230;</p>
<p>Perhaps I missed it, but I don&#8217;t think Google has expressed that they see this as an industrial product.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t mean it cannot be used as one&#8230; Google is in general a bit slow on the enterprise market, I find.</p>
<p>Yeah like late 2013 i hope</p>
<p>they alpha wont come out till 2013- we&#8217;re looking at 2014 or beyond. maybe a retail version announced at I/O 2013</p>
<p>And probably 2018 before a really useful version.</p>
<p>and affordable ($200). as cool as this is, it really does not make life better a $1500. and it does not deliver the full &#8220;terminator&#8221; augmented reality experience useful for video games, designers, architects etcetc.</p>
<p>but, still, it&#8217;s a leap foreward</p>
<p>Ugh. </p>
<p>Just needs the devs buying it now to make those apps for it!</p>
<p>I hope so.</p>
<p>Translation: This is Glasses Beta.</p>
<p>Yep, pretty much.</p>
<p>At first I was mad about it only being available to developers. The n I realized I wouldn&#8217;t have afforded it anyways. Then I cried.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d pay 1500 to be their guinea pig if you had the money?</p>
<p>yes.</p>
<p>If I had a crapton of disposable income, I would,.</p>
<p>Well if I had a crapton then of course.</p>
<p>Its a good investment considered its a revolutionary device with a potential completely untapped app market.</p>
<p>What apps? It&#8217;s only camera.</p>
<p>And a display that&#8217;s in front of you at all times&#8230;</p>
<p>What does it display?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really up in the air at this point, the original concept video showed everything from video calling to phone notifications to walking directions in real time.</p>
<p>Right, but what do these display?</p>
<p>Everything your phone can display.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s a nice dreamy view, but no.</p>
<p>How is that a dreamy view?</p>
<p>Because there is absolutely no way at this point of actually knowing that to be true. Brin can go ahead and say &#8220;we can&#8217;t show you cause we can&#8217;t record it&#8221; but there are an infinite amount of ways to demonstrate the capabilities. The software and design would have to exist to even make it work, and if it does, it can be &#8220;faked&#8221; to at least show what it would look like. No attempts have even been made to that point, so, until that information comes out, it&#8217;s not much more than a camera and a few blips on a low resolution screen.</p>
<p>Ok, but in the end, it&#8217;s a piece of tech with a screen, CPU, cell or wifi radio, camera, microphone, and a touchpad.  It has everything that a cell phone has and therefore can display everything that a cell phone can.  I think you&#8217;re the only one in the conversation that is talking about what it can do right now.  Everybody is talking about what it has the potential to do.</p>
<p>Thing is, until they can produce a discreet (or maybe even any, or that matter) method of input text and numbers, you&#8217;re gonna need a phone as well. I see this going consumer in the next three years but not being an actual worthwhile mobile phone replacement for the next ten.</p>
<p>It must be nice to be able to dictate the futrure though, Mr Brin looks incredibly like Mr Stark in the article&#8217;s picture.</p>
<p>It displays visual things.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only a camera.  It&#8217;s just the only thing they can really show on screen.</p>
<p>They were wholly capable of displaying the expected capabilities in the prototype video, display the actual capabilities would be immensely easier to convey. That bit by Brin was a cop out, but an understandable one, because clearly nothing past the camera has been developed to the point of usability. Hence the &#8220;sometime in 2013&#8221; ship date for a $1500 developer device.</p>
<p>egojab, why is it that I always see you pointing out every single downside on almost every single article Google related?</p>
<p>Because &#8220;THIS IS THE BEST THING TO HAPPEN TO TECH LIKE EVER&#8221; happens every damn day almost, a realistic viewpoint to temper the preteen, pissing your pants, excitement serves for much more useful discussion than just championing your platform of choice while altogether ignoring the inaccuracy of the hype.</p>
<p>I find that ignoring Apple&#8217;s announcements cuts down on the hype by about 90%&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;because clearly nothing past the camera has been developed to the point of usability.&#8221;  <br />
There&#8217;s a basic UI in there that has never been shown off.  I agree, the camera is probably the only thing that is usable enough to show off but I disagree with who I responded with that it&#8217;s only a camera.  When it is released, it will not be just a camera.</p>
<p>The video was an edited aspiration, here you saw a live feed. (And don&#8217;t forget you saw what their CAMERA SAW not what their eyes saw)</p>
<p>It&#8217;&#8217;s the only thing, there is nothing alse. Did they show how they get images? They don&#8217;t upload them, so&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thrun discusses what the glasses can do right now &#8212; including send emails, connect to Google+, and share a live-stream of what you&#8217;re looking at &quot;</p>
<p>Those are the other things that it could do 2 months ago when an engineer from Google showed them off to Charlie Rose in an interview.</p>
<p>Havent seen video of that, can you give me link?</p>
<p>Found it myself, there is no evidence it is possible to send email, check google+, so it is only camera. For live stream you need cells and data sending tools.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzpCcJ8sXik" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzpCcJ8sXik</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just a camera right now.  The final product will not be just a camera.  He posted a picture on G+ and they streamed video go G+ during the sky dive demo.  I&#8217;m so done with this discussion since you are ignoring everything that Google has told us about this device so far.</p>
<p>Are you outright lying, or just making stuff up because the voices in your head tells you its ok? Brin checks his email in them, he gets an audible sound if its from someone he considers important, by tilting his head he sees the text floating in the air in front of him.</p>
<p>There are none&#8230; that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re releasing them to developers&#8230;at their developer conference&#8230;. so they&#8217;ll develop some stuff?  Article says that by Brin&#8217;s own admission it&#8217;s not consumer ready&#8230; not even dev ready &#8212; that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re on pre-order.</p>
<p>Are you a troll or clueless? Do some damn research! Google it check youtube.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d pay $1500 but I wasn&#8217;t at I/O.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming the people who answer yes to this question answer yes because they paid $200 to guinea pig the Android OS itself.  Everything Google does appears to be in a constant state of Beta.</p>
<p>There are so many things wrong with this post.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is an opportunity or if they are taking the piss. Google are charging devs $1,500 to help test, fix and refine their product. Paying to be beta, probably more like alpha, tester? I doubt they&#8217;ll be any shortage of takers, though.</p>
<p>Hmmm. </p>
<p>Except&#8230;.you also get the chance to develop new apps for the device before anyone else so they&#8217;re ready at launch. That alone could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>In addition we don&#8217;t know how much the hardware costs.</p>
<p>Or the battery life, or the storage, or how dependant it is on a data connection, or how much data it uses to stream video/audio, or whether the overlay is mono or colour, or the operating system, or pretty much anything at all.</p>
<p>Or of course, when it&#8217;ll be available. It&#8217;s clearly in a very rudimentary stage if even the early dev units aren&#8217;t shipping until next year (they didn&#8217;t say when next year).</p>
<p>This may not be available to purchase for many years &#8211; Google&#8217;s beta programmes are well famed for lasting a long time.</p>
<p>I am betting the battery will be nuclear-powered.</p>
<p>But seriously, how will they handle the battery? Will it be wireless charging, where it draws electrons (without cords) from your phone?</p>
<p>Also more interested in the health issues this might have.</p>
<p>Based on what? The dev devices aren&#8217;t shipping until next year, Google&#8217;s &#8216;beta&#8217; programmes are infamous for lasting years in some cases, very few people have actually used the device for more than a few minutes so it&#8217;s actual capabilities are largely unknown but you think that consumers will buy these in such high volumes that day zero developers might make hundreds of thousands of dollars?</p>
<p>SERIOUSLY?</p>
<p>Well, for a $1.99 app that for instance gives you a heads up display of speed, distance, and route info while biking (as described by Vic), you&#8217;d need to sell just over 750 downloads to break even. Something tells me that unless this thing gives you instant brain cancer, there are going to be more than 750 people interested in that kind of functionality. Get the device first, develop the app first, corner the market. It&#8217;s a risk, sure. But no more so than buying the first Android phones or tablets. Is $1500 really that much more absurd as a business expense than the $600 devs are expected to shell out for unlocked phones? No. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s an investment. That&#8217;s how business works.</p>
<p>Also, you get to be the first kid on your block with a shiny new toy.</p>
<blockquote>you’d need to sell just over 750 downloads to break even. </blockquote>
<p>Sure, if you value your time at $0</p>
<p>Assuming you can produce software for $0 and your time is also worth $0.</p>
<p>Even on the iOS App Store, which sells way more apps than the Play Store, very few apps crack $100,000. And Apple&#8217;s sold 350m iOS devices, Google announced today they&#8217;ve activated 400m Android devices. Has anybody made $100,000 from an Android app?</p>
<p>Umm, yes.  Don&#8217;t be ridiculous, there have been billions of app downloads, someone has made $100,000 even if none of those were paid apps.</p>
<p>Billions of downloads yes. Two weeks ago Apple announced they&#8217;d paid $5bn to developers, but that&#8217;s $5bn spread across hundreds of thousands of developers. Google doesn&#8217;t publish how much their developers have been paid which means it&#8217;s small (if it was big, they&#8217;d crow about it).</p>
<p>So I ask, again, has anybody made $100,000 from an Android app? Citation requested in advance.</p>
<p>Well, unless you&#8217;re licensing closed APIs (hint: you&#8217;re not), then yes, producing software costs $0. And if you&#8217;re developing the app for yourself instead of a client, then your time is really worth whatever you value it at. It&#8217;s an investment, just like buying the device. You clearly don&#8217;t have much faith in the device&#8217;s success, so obviously it&#8217;s not an investment you think is worthwhile. That&#8217;s good! Because that decreases competition for other people that <em>do</em> think it&#8217;s a worthwhile investment, which in turn increases the likelihood that they&#8217;ll succeed. Us risktakers need people like you in order to be successful. Keep it up!</p>
<p>Software does not cost $0 to develop. Equipment, software, Android developer accounts, devices, and most of all, time! Nobodies time is worth 0 when that time could be done doing something profitable.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve said nothing about my views of the devices success, like everybody else I&#8217;ve seen virtually nothing of it because Google have shown almost nothing about it but like any tech enthusiast, I&#8217;m very interested in it. I&#8217;m only querying your assertion that early devs could make hundreds of thousands of dollars by investing this $1,500 programme. I don&#8217;t see it. Unless you&#8217;re Rovio (Angry Birds), Popcap (Plants vs Zombies) or Marco Arment (Instapaper) and come up with an insanely addictive game or highly desirably functionality and corner the market early,  that sells week-on-week, month-on-month, year-on-year, developers are very unlikely going to crack $100,000.</p>
<p>What you are asserting simply isn&#8217;t backed up in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, unless you’re licensing closed APIs (hint: you’re not), then yes, producing software costs $0&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" target="new"></a></p>
<p>A lottery ticket could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, too.</p>
<p>I think they are purposely pricing it out of the range of people who aren&#8217;t extremely excited by it, and therefore more likely to be invested in making the technology a success. But yes they are also very literally making people pay to be testers. I wouldn&#8217;t call it taking the piss.<p>Also, what if Apple made people pay $10K to test a product that was coming to market? It would be a bloodbath.</p></p>
<p>am I the only one that wouldn&#8217;t want to walk around wearing these weird looking glasses and talk to myself?</p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p>No. Take a look around at any social gathering and see the amount of people engaged more in interacting with their phones than the people around them, not, just imagine that those people are, instead, just staring off into space instead of their phone. Zombieland indeed.</p>
<p>I like the tech. I like the potential. I hate what our society will inevitably do with it.</p>
<p>There is only one feasible outcome.</p>
<p>Porn while at the family picnic.</p>
<p>When everybody else is wearing these, the weirdo is the one who doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Yeah, no.<br />
In your scenario, everyone is still a weirdo, they&#8217;re just much more common.</p>
<p>No, the majority defines what is &#8220;normal&#8221;</p>
<p>No. The majority defines what is &#8220;so over&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nobody will buy this until it is built into actual sunglasses, and those black glasses hipsters with perfect vision, or who previously had contacts now own.</p>
<p>No, you really want the finished product.</p>
<p>Umm&#8230; and what apps? It&#8217;s obvious that the devs need to get their hands on it first. Otherwise you&#8217;ll have a $1500 device with 3 apps.</p>
<p>I honestly have no clue that this Glass does besides taking the photos in first person perspective.  Will it do 50% of what Google showed us in their concept video a few months ago???</p>
<p>And  $1500, well&#8230;. I don&#8217;t really why I really want it at this moment&#8230;. But I gotta say this is a product has a lot of a lot of potentials &#8230;</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Todays&#8217;s female presenter really screwed up this show&#8230;.. She was so nervous&#8230;&#8230;. This is supposed to be the coolllllllest stuff ever&#8230;.</p>
<p>This of it this way, it costs the amount of 5 Nexus Q&#8217;s.</p>
<p>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>1500$ for camera ?</p>
<p>$1500 for a wearable technology 1st edition beta product.</p>
<p>Alpha product.</p>
<p>Ay-yay-yay.</p>
<p>As someone who has followed wearable tech for a long time,  $1500  is actually a pretty good price for a camera, hud, and all the tech that comes in on this device in a package this small.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d jump on it&#8230;.   But the question is will this technology ever be ready for consumers at any price?  I have a feeling this will be nothing more than a niche like the Segway.</p>
<p>Agreed, until this becomes a contact lens type system I have a had time seeing this take off outside of of enthusiasts. I think the glasses pose too many real world hassles. Though I’m sure I’ll be one of those enthusiasts.</p>
<p>If they can integrate it into some sort of &#8220;normal&#8221; looking prescription glasses I would certainly consider it since I wear glasses all the time anyway.  I think there are a lot of other people in the same boat.</p>
<p>Troll</p>
<p>$1500 for a wearable computer technology that&#8217;ll be worth $millions in two decades (if in good condition).</p>
<p>Thats a lot of coin&#8230; Although once they will start mass-producing the price should come down&#8230;</p>
<p>Damn&#8230; I&#8217;m guessing Glass is really A WAYSSS off&#8230;. Hopefully the VERGE Plunks down some COIN for this&#8230;. I&#8217;m looking at you Josh! . . .  Great to see them trying to get it into the hands of devs</p>
<p>Why guess. They&#8217;ve said it time and time again how it&#8217;s a ways off</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got to work out the kinks, that&#8217;s understandable. I bet in 2013, a more affordable Consumer version will be available.</p>
<p>2013 is when devs will be getting the preview version. I wouldn&#8217;t expect the consumer version that quickly.</p>
<p>2015 at the earliest i would think</p>
<p>You guys better order as many as you can. You can easily sell this for far more due to it&#8217;s limited availability.</p>
<p>Sounds like if you pre-order, you&#8217;re basically signing up for a Kickstarter. No firm list of features/capabilities and nowhere near a firm release date.</p>
<p><a href="http://gopro.com/hd-hero2-cameras/">Or you can buy a GoPro right now for only $299 and shoot broadcast-quality HD video with one. Or stream it to the internet, right now. </a></p>
<p>Yeah, but then you&#8217;re not feeding Google info about your habits&#8230;</p>
<p>You really don&#8217;t understand the appeal of these do you?</p>
<p>I understand the appeal of an HD camera that you can wear while doing things like jumping out of airplanes. Others do to, and that&#8217;s why people have made a bunch of sports-cams like the ones I linked above.</p>
<p>Does the gopro stream live, and make use of Hangouts like they did in the presentation?  Have voice operated search?  Yea, didn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<blockquote>Does the gopro stream live</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://gopro.com/hd-hero-accessories/wi-fi-bacpac-remote-combo/">Yes</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you could figure out how to shoehorn one into a Google Hangout, but why would anybody want to do that?</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see the part where they showed voice operated search. Did I miss that announcement?</p>
<blockquote>Have voice operated search?</blockquote>
<p>There is no working demo of this.<br />
The GoPro can stream live, and with a little ingenuity, you can make it work in a hangout pretty easily too.</p>
<p>Can you check your email? Run apps in them?</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing if this will ever take off, or if it will ever be more than a personal broadcasting device. Yes, there is potential, but the things that stand in the way of making it a reality are numerous. The capability has to live up to the appeal, and we&#8217;re a long way away from knowing whether it will, and the expectations will only increase with time, especially with Google teasing so much of it so early.</p>
<p>Indeed &#8211; however Google aren&#8217;t the only ones working at these, they just get most of the PR.</p>
<p>Except that is just a camera, GGlasses has a HUD to view actual information.</p>
<p>yeah that no one knows how it works&#8230;</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve shown how it works&#8230; through your voice. What do you think, you poke yourself in the eye for touch controls? Yeeesh..</p>
<p>Its not just a camera, that&#8217;s a lie on your part. It has a hud (which the camera doesn&#8217;t see of course)</p>
<p>You can if you are an idiot sure.</p>
<p>Google just revolutionized the porn industry.</p>
<p>I need to see Louis document this.</p>
<p>How do you get internet on the Glass in the Sky? Does it have 4G?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Great_Glass_Elevator">Like this.</a></p>
<p>All people calling it &#8220;wearable camera&#8221; don&#8217;t understand its a &#8220;developer&#8221; edition. Which means you buy it and then develop your own &#8220;apps&#8221; for it! This has to be the single best technology to hit us since mobile phone!</p>
<p>I bet they all can&#8217;t wait to program their own version of Instragram!</p>
<p>Yeah, but what kind of apps? Would be nice if they showed what the glasses are actually capable of.</p>
<p>$1500 for a floating low res screen and a camera isn&#8217;t exactly a steal.</p>
<p>If they were read to show what it&#8217;s capable of doing they wouldn&#8217;t be releasing it for developers only. This point has gone over the heads of most of the commenters.</p>
<p>Specifications would be nice before people drop $1500. Even kickstarters have them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they set it at $1500 &#8211; to weed out the idiots.</p>
<blockquote>This has to be the single best technology to hit us since mobile phone!</blockquote>
<p>This type of overdramatic hype will do nothing but ensure that the device will never live up to the expectations people will thrust upon it.</p>
<p>This thing is technically impressive but I won&#8217;t engage in a conversation with anyone wearing anything like it. I don&#8217;t want people taking my picture or googling me without me knowing.</p>
<p>Except, with this, you would actually know if they were doing it, right?</p>
<p>But people can already take your picture and Google you without you knowing.</p>
<p>I was a bit vague so I&#8217;ll explain:</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m talking about is that nowadays if I talk to someone I can see if they pick up their phone, hold it up to my face, and take a picture (or shoot video). I can also see if they start fiddling about and playing with their phone, although I might not always be able to see if they&#8217;re searching Google or not. If I was to tolerate someone wearing Google Glasses, they could potentially be taking my picture or doing an image search for me (or whatever becomes possible later on in its development).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not claiming that I&#8217;m so interesting, but for other people it might be a bigger problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve probably never wanted anything more in my entire life..</p>
<p>Exactly. The last time I was excited that much for a product was iPhone.</p>
<p>this is the biggest crap I ever seen.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even know how it works according to your post above, so how did you come to the conclusion it&#8217;s crap? I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s great, because.. well.. I DONT KNOW. Let&#8217;s wait till the damn thing comes out before we determine it&#8217;s worth and effectiveness, shall we?</p>
<p>Troll harder.</p>
<p>How much did the developer version of the Segway cost?</p>
<p><img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTNb7SPk5mB2PYLXpXduVSUa0PyKgNpqITUdXmYQ-O5mgUjD1H6" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the first version of this way-too-expensive device will be as useful as the first version of Google TV  that I foolishly paid for. Will there be a satisfaction guaranteed return policy?</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not a consumer devices, it&#8217;s a developer platform.</p>
<p>Sign me up for 20! Bwahahahaha!!!</p>
<p>Just kill this retarded idea, Google. You&#8217;re just going to embarrass yourself with another failed project. Stick to what you do best, pedding ads.</p>
<p>peddling.</p>
<p>Nice commenting system, Verge.</p>
<p>Nice proof reading, Bob.</p>
<p>Sounds like we&#8217;ve got a hater on our hands.</p>
<p>Meh, he kind of has a point (though he&#8217;s tollish about it). Google, as a company, would be better served by honing in it&#8217;s focus. I think it&#8217;s trying to do too much, and that will eventually come back to bite them in the ass, I think.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s right Google!  Go back to figuring out how I can get better search results for &#8220;Cute Cats&#8221; instead of doing amazingly awesome things like cars that drive them selves, glasses with a computer inside them, neat methods to cut back on their carbon footprint, and all that jazz.  I need better cat videos god dammit!</p>
<p>I actually think their search is suffering. They are trying to make G+ the center of everything, and while I understand why, I also believe things like &#8220;search plus your world&#8221; and the reliance on your history and data damage the whole &#8220;best result&#8221; nature of what a web search should be. It&#8217;s not about cute cats, it&#8217;s about a search result being the best objective search result, untainted by my location, my habits and the opinions of my friends.</p>
<p>There is certainly value to their R&amp;D efforts into things like self driving cars, and I do not mean to discount that, but just because they are doing all of those things doesn&#8217;t mean they are the only ones who are capable, or the only ones who are doing those things. More importantly, any number of those things would be improved by not being tethered to the larger Google machine, which will inevitably dilute the overall value of such endeavors by trying to figure out how to make it fit their brand as a whole.</p>
<p>No one can be everything to everyone, it&#8217;s pretty simple. No one should trust a single company to be everything to everyone.</p>
<p>I like and appreciate Google, and many of their products, but that does not mean I think they&#8217;re beyond criticism, or that everything they do is perfect. I feel the same way about any company who&#8217;s products/services I choose to invest in and use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Dunno, I think their search is doing fine.  Everything you mentioned that was damaging search can be turned off.  As far as their R&amp;D, even if Google released these products, like you said, they aren&#8217;t the only ones capable.  I can guarantee you that there are more people interested in the automated car technology since Google has shown off what they&#8217;ve done.  I just like companies taking chances and doing awesome, futuristic stuff because it pushes tech along.</p>
<p>When you say &#8216;search is suffering&#8217; you are missing a point here. You are ignoring that the search is suffering not because Google is pushing for G+, but because facebook, twitter has closed itself from Google. <br />
Google wants to get back that data. Hence G+.<br />
You might find it annoying/unnecessary  and its valid. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they should just stop doing what&#8217;s important for their business. If they believe G+ will help them provide a better service to the end user then they&#8217;ll do it. If they keep on listening to a hater like you (which, I am glad, they don&#8217;t) who goes to every article on TheVerge commenting and bashing everything they are coming up with then they&#8217;ed be nowhere.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the beauty of Google. They can AFFORD to do too much. Their revenue is not in their hardware OR most of their software, but from ADS.</p>
<p>They can take a hit in these projects but not lose their stream of revenue.</p>
<p>I imagine it&#8217;s analogous to console development kits. When EA orders Dev Units of 360s or PS3s to develop on, they sure as hell aren&#8217;t paying consumer prices. Whatever comes out to market for the consumer likely won&#8217;t be 1500 dollars. MAYBE 1000.</p>
<p>I hope they&#8217;re more down toward current unsubsidized high-end smartphone rates, in the $6-700 range, especially if they won&#8217;t be available to consumers until 2 years from now.</p>
<p>As more of a prototype, that price makes complete sense.</p>
<p>It will be quite a bit cheaper if a consumer edition is released. I assume it gets information through a smartphone? That would keep the cost down quite a bit, it not needing a cellular radio and everything associated with a much more expensive smart device.</p>
<p>I see this as more of a Bluetooth headset of sorts.</p>
<p>Was any additional information given related to its functionality?</p>
<p>DID YOU NOT SEE THE GUYS STREAM VIDEO FROM A SKYDIVE????</p>
<p>So, no then&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes but what about the game-changing HUD features?? I don&#8217;t need a pair of glasses that can only can stream whatever I am seeing!!</p>
<p>become a developer and buy one.</p>
<p>This is great for those bluetooth headset guy.  The ones that can afford the unlimited data plans and be online constantly.</p>
<p>I would feel weird talking to a guy with one of these pointed at me nonstop.</p>
<p>And this will allow those guys to look like even bigger douche bags than they do today. Technology!</p>
<p>I think they should call it the Google Black Eye.</p>
<p>The day this hits the consumer market is the day that I turn in my drivers license or buy a tank to drive. It&#8217;s bad enough that people can&#8217;t put their phones down when they drive, this will be worse. Seriously, you can&#8217;t even walk into the grocery store without someone almost bumping into you cause they have their face buried in their phone.</p>
<p>With the screen that close to your eye, it would be like watching Iron Man 2 at an Imax theater&#8230;. while you&#8217;re driving!</p>
<p>But no seriously, I can&#8217;t wait for this. At least there should be an app that shows impending accidents so I can try to avoid distracted people.</p>
<p>Wow, this is the second Google-related link I&#8217;ve read today that gave me serious sticker-shock. Must be opposite day.</p>
<p><strong>This has so much potential!<br />
Now you can:</strong><br />
1. Walk around and look nerdier than ever.<br />
2. Creep people out at a party because they’re not sure if you’re taking pictures whenever you’re looking at them.<br />
3. Skydive and streaming VGA quality live feed to your friends sitting in a large auditorium!</p>
<p>Who in their &#8220;right mind&#8221; would buy this?</p>
<p>I want this. $1,500 seems a bargain when you consider how amazing this thing is.</p>
<p>SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take 2!</p>
<p>Hope they use the camera in conjunction with the display to create a &#8216;Minority Report&#8217;-style experience. <br />
That along with vocal and head-motion-gestures would be a sweet experience &#8211; <br />
Esp if they figure out how to pack in absolutely everything from your phone, so it can be used standalone &#8211; maybe it could replicate your smartphone so you could use either at any given time. The possibilities here are exciting</p>
<p>Crowdsourced R&amp;D</p>
<p>Can Google Glass features be emulated on a cell phone with the front or back facing camera?</p>
<p>Google Glass type wearable device + Leap Motion + bangin&#8217; interface = game, set, match.  Apple, you know what to do.</p>
<p>That guy in the picture looks like  Robert Downey Jr. Which is kinda fitting. :P</p>
<p>No body is going to wear these things, glasses=fad. The concept is nice but not practical. If they were just an ear to ear wrap around the back of the head with headphones built in and could project the image like a HUD then yeah, talking.</p>
<p>Nah, it will be something you attach behind your neck, with direct link to your nervous system. You have all the GUI projected through your vision itself. No need for glasses and what not.</p>
<p>Meh, I&#8217;ll wait for the neuro linker. I mean I don&#8217;t think this one can play Brain Burst. :P</p>
<p>Why are people hating on the price? Google clearly stated that this is only for serious developers who wants to improve the product. $1500 is not the price to use the Glass, but it is an INVESTMENT so you can have first dibs on the product/market, that may earn you thousands of dollars in the future.</p>
<p>But is this a sure thing? Of course not. Like in all businesses, there is a concept of risk and reward. The higher the risk, the higher the reward.</p>
<p>And probably they consciously made the price high so only people with serious intentions would buy this one.</p>
<p>The only possibly interesting aspect of the device is its display and that isn&#8217;t even mentioned.  Instead we get to see what idiots see when they jump out of blimps and ride bikes on roofs.  Where&#8217;s the meat?  Something is fishy about this thing.</p>
<p>$1500!?</p>
<p>:o(</p>
<p>Tony Stark?</p>
<p>Hmmm.  $3000 and you could mount two of them on a frame, one on each side.  This will revolutionize porn.  Can&#8217;t see what else it might be good for.</p>
<p>The future is here&#8230;</p>
<p>what&rsquo;s the point of highlighting the already most emphasized articles of the week?</p>
<p>Sometimes I choose more obscure stuff that gets lost in the shuffle of big news. This week was really all about the big news, so a lot of this stuff was pretty well exposed already.</p>
<p>The Google Glass story was excellent. Topolsky is a world-class journalist.</p>
<p>You guys should have just used a huge Pi symbol:</p>
<p><img title="PI!" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Pi-symbol.svg/588px-Pi-symbol.svg.png" alt="PI!" /></p>
<p>Circumference divided by Diameter.</p>
<p>Enough said.</p>
<p>Too big. Otherwise, would have been hilarious.</p>
<p>Or <strong>tau/2</strong> ;-)</p>
<p>Wow&hellip; that&rsquo;s an interesting post.</p>
<p>Good looking laptops. And plaids.</p>
<p>Are you being sarcastic?</p>
<p>My own thoughts are that the setup is all wrong:-</p>
<p>Sitting too close to each other.<br />
The matching pc&rsquo;s look kind of sad.<br />
And the matching fashion faux pas is unfortunate&hellip;</p>
<p>I find the Apple logo showing through the sticker kinda ugly. The sticker should have been in a corner of the lid.</p>
<p>I think the man on the left is more image conscious, hence the deliberate act of obscuring the product placement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpyrF_Ci2TQ" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpyrF_Ci2TQ</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You only need 39 digits of Pi to measure the circumference of the observable universe within the width of one hydrogen atom&rdquo;</p>
<p>I love numberphile and I hate math it&rsquo;s really strange.</p>
<p>Could be that math thats taught in schools is the really dull, yet very useful, stuff, while other really interesting <span class="caps">AND</span> useful stuff is reserved for later on</p>
<p>I wonder how many characters a Verge comment can contain&hellip;</p>

<p>If you open this article in Tweetbot on iOS, all of the numbers turn into phone number urls that you can click to call. I accidentally called a few&hellip;</p>

<p>Want that sticker</p>
<p> I kind of like the 2 person table setup in this video. I know it&rsquo;s probably just because they were on site for the PS4 launch but it gives 90 seconds on the verge a kind of news-like feel.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 4 does <em>not</em> allow you to begin playing games more quickly as they&rsquo;re installing by &ldquo;video streaming&rdquo; a la Gaikai. Instead, it&rsquo;s a more simplistic process where one portion of the game is downloaded, this portion is run and then the rest of the game&rsquo;s content is downloaded in the background. A similar system exists in StarCraft II and Diablo <span class="caps">III</span>, for example.</p>
<p>Please go back and listen to the Playstation 4 announcement, and you&rsquo;ll see what I mean. This misunderstanding has been repeated across the whole site and ought to be corrected.</p>
<p>I think the video streaming part relates more to the PSVita remote playing.</p>
<p>Exactly what I was gonna say.</p>
<p>All I want in my life is some Verge stickers, is this too much to ask?!</p>
<p>Troll warning: there is a digit missing &ldquo;64856 <strong>6</strong> 92346034&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I wonder if this could become the new 90SOTV format.</p>
<p>I want, no I <span class="caps">NEED</span> a Verge Sticker!</p>
<p>I really hope that lingering 3 at the bottom of the post is a reference to The IT Crowd because that show is perfect.</p>
<p>Wow you fellas are just missing your Starbucks there. lawlz</p>
<p>Man, I cannot wait for the future!</p>
<p>I can wait &ndash; as awesome as this is and will be. This also will create privacy concerns and issues no one could dream about yet. Sure these will be banned at most companies and will get more than a few wearers a punch in the face in public.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and will get more than a few wearers a punch in the face in public.</p>

<p>If anything they&rsquo;d get snatched and resold on eBay. Most people aren&rsquo;t assholes to eyeglass-wearers just for wearing eyeglasses anymore.</p>
<p>There should be a &ldquo;Glasses self-destruct!!&rdquo; feature. Either it blows up while the person is running away, or it deactivates them unless you restore them with your google account.</p>
<p>Also, &ldquo;Glasses, report this to the police!!!!&rdquo; function.</p>
<p>Also, I would probably have glass recording at all times if I&rsquo;m walking in the street or driving.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the point. People don&rsquo;t like you recording them and posting videos with them not realizing. On the other hand the porn industry must have a hard on for this stuff.</p>
<p>look honey, no hands!</p>
<p>Since I live in Mountain View (Where Google is) I see a lot of Google Glass around, I even tried this in public &ldquo;Ok Glass, Search for ______&rdquo; and it brought that search result up in front of his glass. It is going to be interesting how people will use this in public and not get distracted over time they will get used to it I guess.</p>
<p>When those glasses are constantly recording you and possibly streaming you to random people they might?</p>
<p>&ldquo;create privacy concerns and issues no one could dream about yet&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand why people are so concerned about this. I think an easy solution will be as straightforward as privacy settings on google+ currently, except instead of &ldquo;Can you search for me&rdquo; it will be &ldquo;can you record/ pull up my data with glasses&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the privacy setting for I don&rsquo;t want my employees recording the computer screen at the office and glancing at keyboard as they type passwords?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d imagine that corporations could install software that blocks glass captures when dealing with sensitive information.</p>
<p>Unless the glasses have airplane mode&hellip;</p>
<p>will we need to take off our glasses in the washroom? will there be an led to indicate recording/picture taking?</p>
<p>stuff like that</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m standing at my window naked. What privacy concerns?</p>
<p>reasonable expectation</p>
<p>We can edit comments now! That&rsquo;s better than hoverboards and jetpacks combined!</p>
<p>You can and will.</p>
<p>Why did you need a tipster when Josh preordered the glasses himself?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I was thinking&hellip;</p>
<p>Looks like someone&rsquo;s invite got lost in the mail.</p>
<p>Wicked =D Glad to see them already starting the dev hackathons. This can only mean good support for when they finally come out</p>
<p>Did someone from The Verge pre-order this?</p>
<p>I think Josh did.</p>
<p>These look silly as fuck, but I&rsquo;m going to buy them immediately.</p>
<p>They could redesign it to look a bit slicker. The frame looks  obtrusive.</p>
<p>This is all pre-release hardware.  Google has said that pretty much everything is in flux, so there&rsquo;s no reason to think the consumer version will look exactly like this.</p>
<p>Got my email this morning and my flight to NYC is booked. I really really hope I get to take my glass"es" home.</p>
<p>Please, do write about your experience in the forums.</p>

<p>Kind of frustrating that the people in the video are clearly using an Autocue while wearing AR headsets that could potentially replace this technology.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good app idea, maybe someone can create something that displays running text and changes speed based on voice recognition of where you&rsquo;re up to at this event?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an idiot and I can think of a million Glass ideas. If only I was a developer&hellip;</p>
<p>Brilliant, although I&rsquo;ve since realised that the person speaking would no longer be looking directly at the camera/the person they were speaking to, which might be a little disconcerting.</p>
<p>As disconcerting as people constantly looking down at their pelvis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had that idea for ages now, but I don&rsquo;t know how the android speech API&rsquo;s work. So I&rsquo;m just stuck using the default VR intent in my 1 app.</p>
<p>Facebook: sends out press invites for an hour-long press conference to show off their &ldquo;Graph Search&rdquo;. Nobody cares.</p>
<p>Google: sends out invites for a hackathon to developers. Everyone loves them.</p>
<p>You might be right, but the killer apps for these kind of device will be based on data, and the facebook search presentation was all about how you can start using their massive data store in ways that benefit you, not just advertisers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d guess that if these kinds of wearable displays become popular apps that can display personalised contextual information at appropriate times could be very useful, such as face recognition at a business meeting. And who has the best store of tagged face images and related data?</p>
<p>Google: &ldquo;We allow you to search nearly the entirety of all known information&rdquo;</p>
<p>Facebook: &ldquo;We allow you to search what kind of music your jackass friends from high-school are into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it doesn&rsquo;t have an answer it uses Bing to search entirety.</p>
<p>I wish I had $1,500 to spend&hellip;</p>

<p>This is awesome! Google has been saying from the beginning that the coolest applications of Glass won&rsquo;t come from in-house, but from third party developers. They are handling this product really well so far. Get developers working now, have some cool early apps to show off at IO, maybe announce a second round of beta hardware then, and then general release next year with a full year of third-party development already behind them.</p>
<p>Two Glasses, hacked together to record stereo, sending it&rsquo;s video to an Oculus Rift headset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so fucking excited.</p>
<p>Okay, a step further.<br />
Feedback from the Oculus to the Glasses.<br />
The Oculus wearer moves his head, and that sets arrows on the Glasses HUD, to tell that guy which way to look.  Or lightly inflates airbags on the appropriate side of the head in a bicycle helmet setup.  So it&rsquo;s like being tapped on the head to be told which way to look.</p>
<p>I really hope Google glasses connects with your smartphone (IOS, Android, exc..) and uses its data rather than requiring a separate data plan by way of an app that supplements google glasses as a second or larger screen</p>
<p>I feel that as a Google I/O attendee I should clarify &ndash; we did not &ldquo;plunk down&rdquo; $1500 at the conference, we simply filled out a form that demonstrated that we are interested in purchasing when they become available.</p>
<p>I wish I could make it to one of these events to get my hands on the device and understand the API before purchasing &ndash; but as it is, I&rsquo;ll have to buy it sight unseen.  I guess that shows how much faith I have in Google :-)</p>
<p>I love it how they sit there with a straight face watching cat gifs the whole time</p>
<p>Okay this is going to sound weird but everything I open this article on The Verge app. Utorrent on my phone opens up too. Anybody else having this issue???</p>
<p>Those must be robots in the video.</p>
<p>Green hair on that woman. Omg.</p>
<p>She needed to match the hair with the blouse. What else could she have done? Buy a blouse that was the color of her hair? That&#8217;s just crazy!</p>
<p>Imagine Homer with those!?</p>
<p>They look pretty good on them.</p>
<p>The official motto of Google glasses should be: &#8220;A fool and his money are soon parted.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a love/hate relationship with this concept.</p>
<p>As a techie/nerd, I love the idea of having a head&#8217;s up display like this.</p>
<p>As a motorcyclist, I see another excuse for someone to watch a screen instead of the road or people around them.</p>
<p>I am the inventor of Russia. Not speak English. I live with this idea for several years. I&rsquo;d like to participate in creating the future. I do not know what to do. How to do it? Help! I could benefit society and accelerate progress. I think so. Here&rsquo;s an article about me. It was written in 2010. <a href="http://pressa.irk.ru/sm/2010/25/004008.html">Your text to link here&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I prefer my reality augmented.</p>
<p>Apple will release their iEye by end of next year and call it innovation and how they came up with the idea, sue Google and all bunch of drama. &#8211; Coming Soon, to theaters near you.</p>
<p>LOLS. This guy&#8230;. awesome stuff.</p>
<p>close , but apple have to release it a year <strong>after</strong> google, and it&#8217;s <strong>google</strong> who sue&#8217;s</p>
<p>Ask him about a price point if you can get a personal chat.</p>
<p>TechCrunch said the pricing of the retail versions will be &#8220;far lower&#8221; than the pricing of the explorer edition. Don&#8217;t know by how much they mean, though.</p>
<p>$750 is already 50% of the developer price.  I think that is considered &#8220;far lower&#8221;.  So i think it is still going to be quite pricey.</p>
<p>In any case, got to take into account that this wont be about for 2-4 years and possibly not out at all.  Could be one of those ideas that go away over time.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will be under $500, so it&#8217;s less than a high-end phone.</p>
<p>The Skydiving demo was awesome. I didn&#8217;t understand what the product did, apart from offer HD point of view video streaming (and stills), but they put on a great show.</p>
<p>What else does Glasses do, or potentially do?</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/9c6W4CCU9M4">Here&#8217;s</a> what it&#8217;ll do in the future.e future.</p>
<p>I thought this was debunked as being very much a pie in the sky concept video? Like those Minority Report style &#8216;in 10 year&#8217;s we&#8217;ll be&#8230;&#8217; videos..</p>
<p>Not saying that concept isn&#8217;t exciting but from where we are, it looks like we are a generation away from that video being a reality.</p>
<p>I mean early 2014, when these Glasses go on sale. What&#8217;s their proposed use? Even if it&#8217;s a HD video recorder, it&#8217;s still a very cool option. I wondered if there was anything round the corner of reality they&#8217;re looking to launch with&#8230;</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve actually said they hope to have those features in the first version of the consumer product.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/31/3053893/googles-steve-lee-on-project-glass-concept-video-not-just-a/in/2689413">http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/31/3053893/googles-steve-lee-on-project-glass-concept-video-not-just-a/in/2689413</a></p>
<p>Sounds promising. Now they&#8217;re in people&#8217;s hands we&#8217;ll see how far the gap is from what we&#8217;ve seen demoed and what we see in that video. Perhaps it&#8217;s a lot further along than implied.</p>
<p>Sound like Josh has one. I wonder if he&#8217;ll wear it on Vergecast this week? I hope there&#8217;s no NDA&#8217;s involved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so early right now we probably could ask what <em>won&#8217;t</em> it do.</p>
<p>Though, I would imagine it would do a bunch of augmented reality stuff.  Overlays of directions on the world in front of you.  Targeted ads as you walk by a store.  Notifications of emails, etc.</p>
<p>Did you see the first keynote when they demoed Google Now? That&#8217;s pretty much the genesis of what we saw in the Project Glass mockup video.</p>
<p>What else is the glass suppose to do&#8230; beside filming stuff and making you look cool? Google has yet demonstrate some compelling reasons for consumers to get them.</p>
<blockquote>making you look cool?</blockquote>
<p>seriously?</p>
<p>Yeah, the &#8220;looking cool&#8221; part is a little crazy.  These don&#8217;t look cool at all.  Same thing as walking around with a BT headset is not cool either, and we&#8217;ve had those now for 7-8 years.</p>
<p>the only thing missing from Project Glass is a blinking light.</p>
<p>Using a bluetooth hands free device doesn&#8217;t look cool either, but it serves a purpose.</p>
<p>To be honest early mobile phone adopters looked like pricks too, but the devices got smaller and didn&#8217;t look as awkward&#8230;</p>
<p>True, and it&#8217;s <em>almost</em> acceptable to walk around with a headset on your head if you aren&#8217;t using it, but it still looks goofy.  These are the same way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to envision a Wall-E style world where people will be walking around, looking/talking at their devices and ignoring everything going on around them.  We&#8217;re already halfway there.</p>
<p>In the city anyway people use their phone so they don&#8217;t have to stare at the person standing 2 inches away from them, with these everyone is going to be staring right into each others face.</p>

<p>what we really need is arms length holographic touch screens in front of us.</p>
<p>All they need is to embed a Leap Motion controller. :)</p>
<p>We would all look pretty ridiculous flailing at things in the air that only we can see, however.</p>
<p>Not on the subways of NYC we don&#8217;t.   There&#8217;d be lots of &#8220;unintentional&#8221; groping.</p>
<p>Its going to change the porn industry.</p>
<p>Google In &amp; Out</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t wear 3D glasses in the privacy of our homes, why would we wear these glasses out in the public.  Is this one of those cool innovations that we don&#8217;t need?</p>
<p>Speak for yourself. I think 3D glasses at home is quite nice :)</p>
<p>I already hate wearing 3d glasses while watching movies, probably wouldnt bother with this.</p>
<p>Unless i am going to the club and need to get some stalker vids.</p>
<p>I am sure it will be worth the bargain bin price of like $700 bucks for consumers or more!</p>
<p>And nobody &#8211; aside from, perhaps, the most ardent of Google zealots &#8211; will waste their time with these stupid things.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not practical and they just make you look like the biggest tool around while wearing them.</p>
<p>Will replace Bluetooths in clubs and sunglasses indoors.</p>
<p>They were sort of putting it direct competition with the &#8220;Go Pro HD&#8221;  cameras. right now people have to mount those on a helmet or strap them to their heads with a clumsy belt system. The skydivers in the video had those on as well perhaps in case the glasses didn&#8217;t work.  If these are waterproof to boot then that is a bonus. People doing activities (climbing, kayaking, skydiving, spelunking etc) where a hand held camera is difficult to manage will benefit. I do think there will be more of a heads up display as well on these making it much more functional.</p>
<p>I could definitely see Sergey in the Ironman suit. That is all.</p>
<p>This Sergey is a huge NERD this project is proof!</p>
<p>You misspelled &#8220;douche&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, I certainly hope it&#8217;s less than $1500.</p>
<p>I for one, comrades, can&#8217;t wait for Google to bombard me with ads via my eyeglasses.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry. CyanogenMod10 will fix things in a jiffy and they you can install AdAway or some such to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.wikia.com/starwars/images/4/47/Lobothead.jpg" /></p>
<p>Augmented reality for my ears FTW</p>
<p>Actually, that&#8217;s roughly where the visual cortex would be, so it&#8217;s not too much of a stretch to believe this device is jacked in directly to his brain!</p>
<p>Plenty of time for others to copy, I hope they have patented the significant bits of the tech at least. While I can&#8217;t wait to have my hands on one, I do share the concern regarding ads being injected into my eyes 24 &#215; 7. I hate ads and hate sharing my info with unknowns. I can&#8217;t wait for someone to solve that problem so I can enjoy tech without reservation.</p>
<p>( On an unrelated note, Sergey looks badass in that pic. )</p>
<p>&quot; I do share the concern regarding ads being injected into my eyes 24 × 7. I hate ads and hate sharing my info with unknowns&quot;</p>
<p>No offence, but this doesn&#8217;t sound like the device for you. These devices tend to be much more useful when you sign up to all the services (that will share data, location, offer advertising).</p>
<p>They should rename this the google gimick</p>
<p>Sergey Brin looks like Tony Stark</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Xy29k.jpg" /><p>Sorry for using your photo Verge editors, I couldn&#8217;t resist</p></p>
<p>DAMNIT<br />
I WAS LITTERALY JUST DOING THAT</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dftJK.jpg" /></p>
<p>Wow, great minds</p>
<p>People need to stop banging on about how they look. By the time they are available they will be a lot more refined. I personally, cannot wait to get them.</p>
<p>Will be interesting when this becomes available. It&#8217;s great to test tech thing like this and put it out there in the world. But I do feel the awkward factor stopping this being a runaway success. People still feel awkward with bluetooth headsets.</p>
<p>I think Glass holds great potential, but  it&#8217;s still very early.  The only thing that&#8217;s really been demonstrated thus far is the camera.</p>
<p>Would have been really cool to see a HUD of some kind over the transmitted video.  Google Maps, geotagging, anything.  They could have even displayed some GPS information, and calculated a speed, for the falling skydivers.  How cool would that have been?</p>
<p>Short version:  It&#8217;s still very early for Glass.  Google also needs to solve the battery problem.  I can believe it&#8217;s 2+ years away.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s not nearly that far: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/lithium-air-battery-advance-could-be-jaw-dropping-improvement-over-li-ion/" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/lithium-air-battery-advance-could-be-jaw-dropping-improvement-over-li-ion/</a></p>
<p>So you can&rsquo;t add third party glasses to them?</p>
<p>They have to be bought pre-assembled?</p>
<p>fragmentation !!! lol</p>
<p>Google Glass fragmentation &ndash; you saw it here first!!! Let this comment go down in history.</p>
<p>Hi mum!!!!! (waves in front of the camera during this famous moment to be referred to in decades to come)</p>
<p>Which actually makes me wonder what they call this OS unless they use android&#8230;.</p>
<p>It by definition can&#8217;t be fragmented there&#8217;s only 1 prototype made by 1 company</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll probably be called Glass OS or just Glass.</p>
<p>Damn, I&rsquo;m liking this comment so hard.</p>
<p>I believe they said in the past that you would be able to wear them with your own glasses. I think they get that there&rsquo;s a large part of the population that needs that option, or the option to have the display on the left side.</p>
<p>Wearable with your own glasses &ndash; that&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>I checked out the Warby Parker Web site and most of their stuff is tortoise shell horn-rim stuff for the douchey hipster crowd. I hope they come up with a wider variety of styles for Google.</p>
<p>lol @ this.</p>
<p>Perhaps Googles thinks &ldquo;the douchey hipster crowd&rdquo; is their market for the glass?</p>
<p>At the very least, their market for early adopters.</p>
<p>I definitely want it, but I have no delusions that they&rsquo;ll ever be considered fashionable.</p>
<p>Maybe once they&rsquo;re integrated into the actual lens and not something extra.</p>
<p>Considering the size/thickness of some modern frames, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s definitely possible to incorporate the Glass technology into a fashionable design. Maybe they could start by making the &ldquo;<span class="caps">HUD</span>&rdquo; span the entire frame, instead of being a little mini lens like in the image in the article.</p>
<p>As an example, think of the &ldquo;nerd&rdquo; glasses all of the <span class="caps">NBA</span> players seem to be wearing. Perhaps the hardware could be interspersed throughout the entire frame, instead of being a single block attached on one side.</p>
<p>So LeBron James will have overhead view built-in.</p>
<p>He already has it doesn&rsquo;t he? :)</p>
<p>What?   They&rsquo;ll definitely be fashionable.</p>
<p>so let me get this straight, I <span class="caps">COULD</span> use my mobile phone to get the same exact info but I&rsquo;m given the option to pay more money and put these glasses on?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice wearable tech and  I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll make them look a little nicer.</p>
<p>The video earlier today (or yesterday I don&#8217;t remember lol) for Google Glass made me want one based on emotion, but then logically it doesn&#8217;t make much sense. My heart says yes but my head says no. (Which is kinda how your comment sounded)</p>
<p>Putting uplifting  music into the video has more power in shaping peoples opinions than they will admit to themselves.</p>
<p>Yes! And showing them living lives that everyone wishes they had (like Bucket List lives).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a horrible argument. I could also <span class="caps">NOT</span> buy a smartphone and data plan and just get my information from my desktop Gateway computer, but it&rsquo;d like to think it&rsquo;s not 1999.</p>
<p>Having the glasses would make it so much better than having to pull out my phone. The biggest problem I find is when I&#8217;m doing something usually need both hands and this would solve that problem. It would be way more convenient for me at least. I do some construction on the side and these would be awesome to use. A lot of situations and work places would benefit from this as it would free both of your hands up</p>
<p>You have a Gateway computer? Are you sure it&rsquo;s not 1999?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ve actually never owned a Gateway. Was just using it as an example. But I still have a 2004 Compaq desktop in storage in my basement for some reason. My smartphone has almost three times the memory that came with that thing.</p>
<p>Very smart. If they&rsquo;re able to hit the sub $500 price tag, I am sold.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny, somehow attractive people are still attractive, no matter what they happen to be wearing&hellip;</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s sort of the definition.</p>
<p>My point of that was the logical converse&hellip;</p>
<p>Google Glass probably isn&rsquo;t going to look &lsquo;good&rsquo; on you unless you&rsquo;re a model.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got no worries then.</p>
<p>Just how many things is Google working on</p>
<p>More than you can count.  And this is after cutting lots of projects.</p>
<p>everything. it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>How does it get data? looks like there is no place for a sim there? And useless carriers as usual will not be on board.</p>
<p>It going to use Bluetooth 4.0 LE,</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Segway for your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p>The white sidebar has to go away eventually.  Tuck all that electronics and battery behind you ear, into the phone in your pocket.  Somehow get it down to a small glass rectangle.</p>
<p>Watch your money disappear.  Right in front of your eye.</p>
<p>Boy, if you thought Bluetooth earpieces were douchy, wait until these come out.</p>
<p>I was thinking exactly the same thing</p>
<p><span class="caps">IMO</span> Google needs to partner up with a well known brand like RayBan or Oakley or something, and work with them to get this tech integrated into a normal looking pair of glasses/sunglasses that look desirable to the masses. If Google Glass remains looking like something else entirely like it is currently, I don&rsquo;t see it taking off.</p>
<p>In many ways, Warby Parker is the hipster&rsquo;s version of those brands. They&rsquo;ve got a lot of models that are very close to some RayBan designs too. If Google is indeed partnering with them, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll see some more normal-looking pairs of glasses eventually.</p>
<p>warby parker is the future of those brands and aligns more with google in that respect.</p>
<p>aligning with an old brand doesn&rsquo;t help google at all as few old people will adopt this, as the comments attest to.</p>
<p>this is strictly a future play &ndash; with moneyed younger people &ndash; hipsters and nerds &ndash; getting in early on until the price drops and then they go wide.</p>
<p>Warby Parker is a much better choice than RayBan or Oakley because they will not require such high margins for something that is so cheap to make.  If you look at the philosophy of WP, they not only sell the frames <span class="caps">AND</span> lenses for a reasonable price, but they give another pair away to those in need.</p>
<p>They are the best company to go to in terms of making this affordable.</p>
<p>I also like their designs.</p>
<p>I.can&rsquo;t.freaking.wait.  I want one.</p>
<p>WB uses extremely low quality materials.  Thats how they make it affordable.  Since you only get 2 eyeballs its worth the investment in quality lenses and frames.  Its only like your most importnat sense; vision.</p>
<p>I wonder if maybe frames like this could hide/integrate the computer part of glass.</p>

<p>I found this on a google search for Warby-Parker.  It almost looks like Google Glass is in there.</p>
<p>As someone who always has to wear glasses anyway, I&rsquo;d pay for glasses with my prescription that have this tech added in.</p>
<p>Too bad Warby Parker is shit.</p>
<p>in terms of quality or style?</p>
<p>I hope they make one that&rsquo;s large frame, I think I will look ridiculous in this.</p>
<p>OH <span class="caps">MAN</span>&hellip;. they have a monocle, that means we could end up with <span class="caps">DBZ</span> scouters&hellip;. But fashionable&hellip; <img title="SAIYAN" src="http://www.warbyparker.com/monocle/#" alt="SAIYAN" /></p>
<p>Cool. Cool cool cool. Can&rsquo;t wait to see the video. I like Sergey, he&rsquo;s become my favorite Google guy.</p>
<p>No kidding.  He&rsquo;s a real class act, and I like the way he keeps &lsquo;randomly&rsquo; popping up.</p>
<p>I thought that this commentators take was perfectly balanced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;we should pay more attention to our companions and surroundings&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>From your link to Gruber, Master-Troll:<br /></p>
<blockquote>Look at the fucking picture of him up there. We&rsquo;re taking advice on cool from this guy? Seriously?</blockquote>Yeah, great point Sir Gruber.<br /><img title="John Gruber, Trollololol" src="http://www.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/0836/40836v1-max-250x250.png" alt="John Gruber, Trollololol" />
<p>Gruber&rsquo;s point (which you omit) was actually pretty good&hellip;. How is wearing a computer on your face not emasculating?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think Google is pulling the right thread with Google Glass, I just don&rsquo;t think it becomes a killer product until it can be worn inconspicuously and the interface becomes seamless and easy to dismiss.  Maybe that will eventually require some kind of contact lenses instead of glasses.  I think Google&rsquo;s experiment is going in the right direction &mdash; I just don&rsquo;t think they have a hit product&hellip;.. yet.</p>
<p>Um, they also have the foremost researcher in the world on augmented reality contacts as the chief scientist heading up Google Glass, just a helpful <span class="caps">FYI</span>.  Check out the Rainbow&rsquo;s End by Vernor Vinge pretty much describes the world google is building very accurately.</p>

<p>Google is building? Lol. Separate fact from fiction, kiddo.</p>
<p>What else do engineers do? Sit around and look smart and cool?</p>
<p>Well some build the <em>world</em>. Other build things to throw against the wall and watch it drop.</p>
<p>now thats an argument, right?   you must be very mature  /s</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a argument relying on basic tech history concerning Google. Don&rsquo;t blame me if you just bought your first touchscreen smartphone and now consider yourself knowledgeable about such things.</p>
<p>Or should I make a list of Google products that didn&rsquo;t build the world, but instead failed miserably?</p>
<p>Sorry if I expect people to get certain things without spelling out the obvious. Though you could do a better job at reading what I quite and easily figure out what I&rsquo;m referring to&hellip;.</p>

<p>Um, who are you calling a troll? Just curious. It&rsquo;s certainly not me, so I wonder&hellip;</p>
<p>you of course, im calling you a troll.<br />
why? im reading your comments and yes, you&rsquo;re not that kind of  juvenile troll that just insults and tries to generate flame and anger that we&rsquo;re all so used to, but still, you are.</p>
<p>Your name and &ldquo;about&rdquo; description makes it extremely difficult to have a sane conversation with you.</p>

<p>Joss Whedon really does have a problem with his plots and characterizations. I think that&rsquo;s why Firefly failed. Both that and Dollhouse had a serious flaw in their execution. With Dollhouse, it was a main character who never stayed the same. She literally changed personalities each episode, giving viewers no PoV to be attached to. Think of GoT if all the characters died in each episode. <em>That</em> would be a problem (as opposed to the <em>old</em> complaints about Martin killing beloved characters here and there).</p>
<p>With Firefly, though I&rsquo;m sure some will say that Fox messed it up by not showing the episodes in correct order, I did watch them in correct order and it had the problem of a mostly unseen and unheard of antagonist. Therefor making their travails not as interesting as they could be. Imagine a Star Wars where the Empire rarely shows up and when they do, it&rsquo;s a one off thing. Sure, Firefly was building towards something, but it was taking sweet time to do it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s why you posted that gif? So you could get my opinions on Firefly and Whedon&rsquo;s other works?</p>
<p>Make no mistake though. I enjoyed Firefly for what it was (though Serenity felt like a two hour episode and not a movie) as I do like Space Opera, and Dollhouse was interesting (though not addictive). Also an old Buffy fan and Avengers rock. So no need to rage at me, Whedon fanboy! I love the guy too!!! :P</p>
<p>see? you just proved my point.</p>
<p>if you need to argue for the sake of it, im sure you&rsquo;ll be right at home on reddit, or any similar site; you&rsquo;re neither contributing to the discussion here, neither willing to do the effort.</p>
<p>why pretend not knowing why you&rsquo;re being called a troll, or what that gif represents? <strong>shrugs</strong></p>
<p>Rainbows end is a fantastic book by an even better Hard Sci-Fi author. Another great (and more recent/relevant) book is Existence by David Brin read page 18 for a good idea of the future of Augmented Reality <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Existence-David-Brin/dp/0765303612#reader_0765303612" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Existence-David-Brin/dp/0765303612#reader_0765303612</a></p>
<p>Thank you for the recommendation. Though the &lsquo;hard scifi&rsquo; part scares me off. :P I like good stories and characters (or experiences) first and foremost.</p>
<p>In return, I recommend The Wreck of the River of Stars, The Reality Dysfunction, Leviathan Wakes, and the very fun Deathstalker (if you want a fun awesome non-hard scifi similar (very) to Star Wars).</p>
<p>:D</p>
<p>The hardware can only get smaller. What happens when it becomes &ldquo;invisible&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Exactly my thought. Talking to my glasses, muttering all the time, seems strange. The vocalizing component of controlling a device may be simpler than typing and touching, but muttering all the time is another hindrance. Maybe we will need to link Apple&#8217;s supposed wrist device to Giigle Glasses.</p>
<p>I suspect there will be more ways to navigate Glass than just voice.  Probably voice for all text entry, in lieu of a keyboard, but likely either eye-gestures or (what I would like to see) a capacitive ring manipulated conspicuously with the thumb for basic navigation.  A wrist mounted device is also a possibility, but I feel that would have the same problem as just using a smartphone for things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is wearing a computer on your face not emasculating?&rdquo; Because real men need to know each other&rsquo;s power levels!  How else can we pick fights with people we know are weaker than ourselves?</p>
<p>Gruber and his Ad hominem.<br />
And I think being able to look up whil ereading a text, navigating a space or whatever does reconnect us with our environment and pay more attention that looking down at our phones&hellip;<br />
Gruber has fallen a lot ever since the &ldquo;lawsuit of the century&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think being able to look up whil ereading a text, navigating a space or whatever does reconnect us with our environment and pay more attention that looking down at our phones&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the point is that using a phone is too distracting, the solution isn&rsquo;t to mount the phone in front of your face.</p>
<p>Gruber&rsquo;s right on this (and isn&rsquo;t making an ad hominem).  There are a lot of reasons why Google Glass might be useful, but one of them is clearly <strong>not</strong> that smartphones are emasculating.  That&rsquo;s a bizarrely stupid claim, and Gruber is right to call him out on it.</p>
<p>considering that he said &ldquo;<strong>this fucking guy</strong>&rdquo; and then proceeded to link to couple of weird pictures, and basically making fun of brin&rsquo;s appearance, it&rsquo;s quite obviously ad hominem. And unsurprising.</p>
<p>Ad hominem comments aren&rsquo;t inherently off-base. You are allowed to dismiss some arguments based on who they come from. Having said that and as much as I enjoy Gruber, he&rsquo;s not one to be talking on this account.</p>
<p>I agree but when your argument is &#8220;he has bad style&#8221;, I think that falls smack in the middle of Ad Hominem territory especially when you pull up old pics of the guy you&#8217;re attacking to prove a point.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really off-base, however, since Brin&rsquo;s <em>initial discussion</em> was about metaphorical &ldquo;emasculation,&rdquo; and hence, about how &ldquo;cool&rdquo; you look using a particular tech.</p>
<p>Also, Gruber may be returning fire back at Brin&rsquo;s assertion, but Gruber doesn&rsquo;t claim that he himself looks any cooler. He simply questions Brin as a source for &ldquo;looking cool&rdquo; from the sidelines.</p>
<p>I dont really care anymore if goober was right or not, if he had controlled himself and said the same thing in a less condescending and insulting way, he might have been taken seriously. But he hasn&rsquo;t been for a while now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gruber&rsquo;s right on this (and isn&rsquo;t making an ad hominem). <br />
Gruber does exactly Ad Hominem attack&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Bring is right, when people are in ackward / unsecure places and situations, they start looking their phones, trying to look doing something and &ldquo;hiding&rdquo; about the environment.<br />
Like when you are waiting a bus or metro, people easily place hand in pocket/purse and take up a phone and play with it.</p>
<p>Many can not anymore live without touching their phones in whole day. <br />
If I remember correctly, there was study from how often people toke phone to their hand.<br />
Here it is: <a href="http://www.livescience.com/25075-cellphone-use-contagious.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/25075-cellphone-use-contagious.html</a></p>
<p>What Brin is saying, is exactly correct. When you wear classes what presents you on top corner on your vision a messages etc, you don&rsquo;t have any need to pull phone out and you focus to your environment.</p>
<p>Someone argues about Verge testing glasses in Google Office and street and person watching to top right corner&hellip; that is a reaction when you are totally new with those glasses. In a day or two you really forget the glasses (I talk from experience of different kind glasses but exactly the same functionality) and the information becomes &ldquo;transparent&rdquo; to you. You don&rsquo;t need to look exactly to that position to see what it is saying. It really becomes like a <span class="caps">HUD</span> in <span class="caps">FPS</span> games or in airplane. The information what can be given in that situation is very limited by details, as you can not show text but one or two words or video or simple drawing.</p>
<p>In day or two it becomes like you are watching a video next to browser window without actually looking at it but you see what is happening in it. You are not of course watching movies or series trough glasses (maybe one day) but more like map kind data and sometimes the video call. And as Google presented, when you get example picture, it is easy to just check the picture and continue working like someone would be holding picture next to the work you are doing but you are hands free.</p>
<p>So with Google glasses when you are walking some new place and you need map, you can really focus to surrounding instead watching the tiny screen. When you are standing on bus stop you can watch TV news while looking the direction where bus is coming and so on.</p>
<p>Many has huge problem at begin to accept the information what is presented to right eye, because most people (95%) are right handed and their left eye is the dominant eye and information what is projected to right eye is at begin hard to accept but in day or two it becomes normal.</p>
<p>So no, you don&rsquo;t look idiot standing/walking and staring to &ldquo;top right&rdquo; in the air.<br />
And because you can look forward and watch map or other data, you don&rsquo;t hit on people like with smartphones what typically cuts your vision to arms lenght and two meter or shorter front of you.</p>
<p>The beauty in those projection glasses is that image is sharp no matter what distance you are looking.</p>
<p>Yep, so instead of being distracted when we whip our phones out of our pockets, we are now going to see everything in a <span class="caps">HUD</span>. I&rsquo;m going to love conversing with people who are actually just checking their Facebook rather than listening to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying it eliminate the barrier but it&#8217;s definitely less than a phone and not all cases are as extreme as the one you mentioned. I doubt that people will pop their head backwards say &#8220;ok glass; open Facebook&#8221; in the middle of the conversation, but if you get a text, instead of taking out your phone, you just read it on the <span class="caps">HUD</span>, take action or continue your chat. But it&#8217;s definitely still intrusive.</p>
<p>I understand it&rsquo;s different if you&rsquo;re in a corporate environment, but if I&rsquo;m conversing with someone I value, I don&rsquo;t whip out my phone when it buzzes. No, that&rsquo;s most likely unimportant and can wait (in any case, if I had very important business to attend to then I probably wouldn&rsquo;t schedule a talk with someone or I&rsquo;d configure that notification differently). Having the Glasses stream in Facebook notifications could be just as bad, and of course you&rsquo;re assuming that wearable computing will always remain within the confines of Google Glass and voice commands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, reading and understanding someone speaking to you engage the same part of the brain. We&rsquo;re woefully equipped to multitask in that regard. Some people can automate linguistic processes to the level of being able to multitask (e.g. simultaneous translator reading a book and translating what he/she is hearing at the same time) but for most people, it&rsquo;s impossible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d argue that taking out your phone to check a message during a conversation, and checking a message on Google Glass during a conversation are equally distracting, only with your phone the other person can see what you&rsquo;re doing, while with Google Glasses he/she doesn&rsquo;t know why you stopped talking, or why you&rsquo;re not paying attention to the conversation.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know people generally had a problem with that.  Personally I&rsquo;ve never had a problem listening to a conversation while I&rsquo;m doing other things.  In fact, I generally find it harder to actually listen if I&rsquo;m not also doing something else.  Just looking in someone&rsquo;s eyes and nodding during a convo tends to make me unfocussed and I start getting legit distracted by their face, or whatever is behind them, or some other random thought that shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>This is all just me, though.  I really had no idea most people couldn&rsquo;t do that O_o</p>
<p>You mean Google+?</p>
<p>Glass isn&rsquo;t meant for browsing activities like that.  It is meant to surface relevant information to you at the time.  It&rsquo;s for Google now, questions/searches, notifications, maps for where you&rsquo;re going at the time, pictures/videos etc.  Browsing Facebook in the top right corner of your vision would be ridiculous, so that&rsquo;s not really a concern.</p>
<p>I wonder how much Gruber has lost on <span class="caps">AAPL</span> shares&hellip; no wonder he&rsquo;s sour&hellip;</p>
<p>Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/30/felix-salmon">doesn&rsquo;t</a> own Apple stock.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s a free corporate tool!? oh myyyy</p>
<p>nothing is free, he probably gets a salary and perks.</p>
<p>Prove it or shut up.</p>
<p>did I hit a nerve there sweetheart?</p>
<p>Did i hit a nerve there sweetheart? I don&rsquo;t have to prove jack, i stated a probability. And the probability is high. You prove otherwise or shut up.</p>
<p>Well sometimes, he is a tool, though it&rsquo;s rarely when related to Apple. On App.net for instance and the Twitter situation, he and other Apple bloggers seem to perptually not realize that Twitter is doing a very Apple&rsquo;ish thing.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re not referring to that, and are instead referring to his many articles where he trounces <em>your</em> team with facts and logic and legit links, which is why some of you get a bit whiny and childish whenever he is brought up.</p>
<p>Though feel free to post your own facts and logic and links to prove that he&rsquo;s a corporate tool though. :)</p>
<p><em>perpetually</em> :P</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I mean by Twitter with this recent <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/26/falcon-pro">DF</a> article. Gruber&rsquo;s whole complaint is that Twitter&rsquo;s rules are making it hard for developers. Think about that for a second. Gruber is complaining about rules that make it hard for a developer. Now, he has complained about the App Store in the past, but compared to his Twitter complaints it was very light and on rare occasions as opposed to his constant tirade against Twitter. A tirade even when he says little and links to those who say more because of his well known agreement with what he&rsquo;s link to.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the real problem with his complaints.</p>
<p>When you compare the differences between those two companies and their platforms, Apple probably wants a healthy third party ecosystem and Twitter does not. At all. Their game plan is totally different. And it&rsquo;s probably working out quite well for them.</p>
<p>Even worse than this, and I&rsquo;m embarrassed for him because he can&rsquo;t see how ridiculous that position is, he strongly support App.net. Think about that! Gruber strongly supports a non-mainstream alternative that&rsquo;s not better for users than the default and has no chance in hell of succeeding because regular Twitter users don&rsquo;t give a damn about Tweetbot developers and their kin. <span class="caps">OMG</span>.</p>
<p>I seem to be the only one who has realized this, but on account of not really giving that much of a damn about Twitter except when these blind hypocrisy comes up, I haven&rsquo;t made a post here or Tweeted him about it or etc until now. But basically, Gruber is complaining about Twitter for being like Apple and making Apple-like decisions for the benefit of their own platform and pissing off geeks while doing so. So yea, he can be quite the tool at times.</p>
<p>Thanks, now I don&rsquo;t have to wonder any more. My initial guess was apparently wrong.</p>
<p>No problem. I enjoy fact checking people here. :)</p>
<p>He looks normal. And I&rsquo;m guessing he isn&rsquo;t wearing webbed toed shoes or whatever they&rsquo;re call. And he&rsquo;s not being hypocritical, since he wasn&rsquo;t saying he was a master of &lsquo;cool&rsquo; either. So&hellip; don&rsquo;t quite get your point, besides regular Gruber douchey hate.</p>
<p>Man, he is such a douche. Who makes fun of the way someone else looks just because he doesn&rsquo;t care about the product being made?!</p>
<p>Who makes fun of the way someone else looks just because he doesn&rsquo;t care about the product being made?!</p>
<p>Um, he&rsquo;s making fun of Brin because of what Brin said. At the end of the day, &lsquo;emasculate&rsquo; is a bit of a term relating to &lsquo;cool&rsquo; and &lsquo;fashion&rsquo;. So read better next time. :)</p>
<p>Gruber is constantly bashing Glass, claiming it&rsquo;s vaporware and doesn&rsquo;t exist, it&rsquo;s worthless, etc. And he&rsquo;s posting pictures of Brin, claiming he&rsquo;s uncool in the way he looks. So yeah, he&rsquo;s referring to the way he looks.</p>
<p>2/10: You&rsquo;re pretty bad at trolling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>claiming it&rsquo;s vaporware</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has? Do you mean recently with the release news, in which case I must&rsquo;ve missed it and would like a link. Or do you mean around the time last year when it was first announced, in which case he was right because that Glass could do a <em>helluva</em> lot more than take pictures and videos and texts. There was a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4">video</a> for it if you wish to see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2/10: You&rsquo;re pretty bad at trolling.</p>

<p>Trolling. What people say at the end of their posts when they presented no facts above. I love it! :D</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/20/google-glass">Here&rsquo;s</a> your link. It was in response to Google showing off the UI the other day.</p>
<p>Ah, I remember now. Thanks.</p>
<p><em>Vaporous</em> and <em>vaporware</em> are not the same thing though. Also he makes it clear in his other recent posts about Glass being a real product that will be released. So I.E., keep in mind he&rsquo;s not calling it vaporware, he&rsquo;s calling it vaporous.</p>
<p>Now, to call it vaporous is the wrong term to use as of now. Certainly it deserved the term <em>vaporware</em> before the release date and so on (so all last year and last month). But while recently he (and I) have accepted it exists as a real product (vaporware watered down and made real <em>that is</em>), he seems not to recognize that Google is no longer saying it can do all those wonderful things that were showed in the original video.</p>
<p>So, 1, I don&rsquo;t believe Glass is vaporware of vaporous. 2, Gruber is using the term &lsquo;vaporous&rsquo; wrong. 3, Project Glass was vaporware no matter how you split it, and 4, Gruber having a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/02/bounding_asterisks">strong</a> <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/07/language-log-asterisks">interest</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">language</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/09/24/five-million-fives">how</a> it&rsquo;s used, he may have a legit reason for using that specific word or he may have used it wrongly. &lsquo;Vaporous&rsquo; being a word for something that smells like &lsquo;Vaporware&rsquo;, yet possibly isn&rsquo;t. I only say this because I don&rsquo;t think Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/22/google-stores">doubts</a> at all Glass is coming out and so to call it &lsquo;vaporous&rsquo; would be a mistake by him unless he has a good reason, which I doubt.</p>
<p>But yea, he callied it <em>vaporous</em>, not <em>vaporware</em>. And the meaning of those two words are not the same, even if Gruber is wrong <em>and</em> contradictory to call it either as of today.</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>Though&hellip; vaporous could just be a word he uses because Glass comes off as vaporware&hellip; Yea, I was too quick to hit the Reply button. But I was just thinking this all of the last week about how 1, We don&rsquo;t know the battery life, 2, We don&rsquo;t know how it&rsquo;s charged, 3, We don&rsquo;t know how a user would program it, Etc.</p>
<p>So maybe it&rsquo;s not wrong to call it vaporous at all. Just because Josh got to play around with a <em>prototype</em> doesn&rsquo;t make it a real product.</p>
<p>The problem I&rsquo;ve found with Gruber, and please correct me if I might have this wrong, but he has Apple&rsquo;s dick so far up his ass his mouth is ejaculating <span class="caps">AAPL</span> press releases.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s ad hominem.</p>
<p>But true.</p>
<p>but not relevant</p>

<p>So not actual facts or anything. Just rabid fanboy hatred? Mkay.</p>
<p>Daring Fireball? No thanks.</p>
<p>Well, looking at him standing there, he looks like he&rsquo;s been touching &ldquo;emasculating touchscreens&rdquo; far too long.</p>
<p>Probably tired from inventing cool shit and making millions of dollars per year.</p>
<p>Maybe so. But I guess to spell it out for you: I don&rsquo;t take his word for what&rsquo;s &ldquo;emasculating&rdquo; or not. The Glass hardware is an eye-roller.</p>
<p>So is your username, dear.</p>
<p>Is that really a valid rebuttal? That&rsquo;s a desperate grab, dear. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> the ad hominem people were clamoring for above.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s true: You fanboys will lash out at anything.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really that into Glass, actually. But your condescension makes you a valid target for what you so adorably claim is ad hominem, when in fact I&rsquo;m just trolling.</p>
<p>An eye-roller? Really? Exactly what about it is the opposite of impressive to you?</p>
<p>It looks stupid to me. That&rsquo;s pretty exact. A single metal bar, with nice eye-glass design. When it starts to become integrated into various frames so it doesn&rsquo;t look stupid, well, then we may have something.</p>
<p>Now&hellip; Let me turn your vapid question back on you:</p>
<p>What_ exactly_ about the hardware is so impressive to_ you?_</p>
<p>Nothing is amazing right now. Neither was the Altair. I don&rsquo;t understand peoples lack of imaginations to see what not Glass could be, but what could the form factor and this kind of computing device <span class="caps">COULD</span> be in some years.</p>
<p>IT IS A <span class="caps">PROTOTYPE</span>!!!  It may or may not look just like this when released.  There have already been rumours/stories of them working with glasses designers, they&rsquo;ve said they have a reference design for people that wear glasses and the device can come off its current frame and attach to a different one.  It will get smaller over time and some people will find the functionality useful and aren&rsquo;t as concerned that they &ldquo;look cool&rdquo;.  I think the potential for this kind of technology is incredible.  The initial product may not be flawless but what new product category is ever flawless on first iteration?</p>
<p>Appropriate phrase, because using Glass will make you look like you&rsquo;re rolling your eyes.</p>
<p>Page &amp; Sergey in the moooorning</p>

<p>I require video. When can we expect it?</p>
<p>The video belongs to <span class="caps">TED</span>, so it&rsquo;s up to them. Could be a few months.</p>
<p>months?! way to spread ideas&hellip;</p>
<p>why don&rsquo;t they release the videos as soon as recorded so they benefit from the buzz and exposure from articles like this one.</p>
<p>this will bring more visitors to their site than in a few months and so have more people see the others videos hence more spreading of ideas.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand why they&rsquo;re so &lsquo;outdated&rsquo; like this. it&rsquo;s kinda not very TEDish at all.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really see how glass solves this problem. All you&rsquo;re really doing is just moving it to a new device while at least seeming like you&rsquo;re paying more attention.</p>
<p>Being able to look briefly into a corner of your vision is completely different than being fixated at a screen in your hands for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited for this and am ready to embrace the future. I put in 3 applications to be part of the explorer program.</p>
<p>Try holding your phone up level with your head, adjust your focus on it with one eye, and tell me it&rsquo;s really all that different. This is the optical equivalent of a Jawbone, a distracting piece of tech right infront of your face. I love the Glass, like to imagine all these cool cyberpunk scenarios that can play out with it, but it won&rsquo;t fix this weird social issue.</p>
<p>The only negative, secret recording, can be solved with a UK-like law that requires devices taking photos or video to show some form of blinking light (a red <span class="caps">LED</span> for example would do the job)</p>
<p>It already has that. Check out the earlier releases on theverge.com for references to this.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s assuming that you can&rsquo;t turn that light off with a hack.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LED</span> leads, meet multi-tool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what.. why am I meeting multi-tool?&hellip; You bastard! you&rsquo;re trying to disconnect me!?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just because something is a law doesn&rsquo;t make it impossible. Just because something is built to the letter of the law doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can&rsquo;t be used illegally.</p>

<p>Um, my Jawbone is on my wrist (or was, until it broke, version 2 of the UP band isn&rsquo;t as durable as they said&hellip;). Is Jawbone now synonymous with &ldquo;bluetooth headset&rdquo; the way iPod is with MP3 player?</p>
<p>Or Kleenex? Yes.</p>
<p>You should know that I read your post in Stewie&rsquo;s voice.  And I agree.</p>
<p>Wow, you actually typed &ldquo;Um.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why must people try so hard to be condescending?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll fix that weird social issue.  But it&rsquo;ll bring up other ones.</p>
<p>The first and most obvious, though not the most useful, difference is that the Glass is transparent, which at least makes a small difference. Another difference is that it&rsquo;s always just up and to the right of your eye meaning that, as Brin was saying, it&rsquo;s not like a phone that you can pull out to look like you&rsquo;re busy: you wont look any busier because the glass is always right there, you&rsquo;ll just look like a person standing around.</p>
<p>That feeling will drive you to go look for something more real to do, or at least that&rsquo;s the idea. Recently I have tried not touching my iPhone whatsoever when I&rsquo;m around friends and I really like the results. I tend to be driven to go to new places and end up having more fun conversations and memorable experiences.</p>
<p>I think that the glass would allow me to achieve that same social feeling while still being able to view any important information that I might actually need to pull my phone out for. I am also very excited to see this technology move forward, but I have different hopes for it than you do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that you&rsquo;ve watched Joshua&rsquo;s video of his day w/Google Glass. Did you notice that whenever he was actively interacting with it, his eyes were always looking up &amp; to the right at that little display?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but if I were having a conversation with someone and they kept breaking eye contact like that, I&rsquo;d find it just as irritating as if they pulled out a phone in the middle of the discussion. Maybe even more so.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m a bad conversationalist, but I can&#8217;t maintain eye contact consistently through an entire conversation. I usually look at my surroundings occasionally while talking to people. I don&#8217;t see how glass would be noticeably  different for me.</p>
<p>You are yes.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so.. when you&rsquo;re having a conversation with someone you don&rsquo;t want to sit and stare at them without ever looking around. It makes people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>same here, but if I&rsquo;m wearing glass, it&rsquo;ll be incredibly obvious when I&rsquo;m looking at that and when I&rsquo;m just looking around elsewhere. I guess the one thing is that to use glass, voice is required. So that makes it a lot harder to use in a conversation.</p>
<p>Voice is <strong>not</strong> required. But the alternative is an even more awkward touch/swipe/tap on the frame arm.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible that you are a terrible conversationalist, but not knowing you, I can&rsquo;t say one way or the other.</p>
<p>However, I maintain that there is a difference between normal random gazes off into the distance &amp; the deliberate glances you make at a cell phone or your Google Glass display. Also, remember that rolling your eyes is usually interpreted negatively &ndash; and the Google Glass Glance Maneuver (coined it!) might come across similarly&hellip; or it could make it look like you&rsquo;re thinking really, really hard&hellip; which isn&rsquo;t so bad I guess.</p>
<p>Behaviors change though. I remember reading something a while ago that rolling your eyes was a manifestation of women entering the office environment in the 70s and 80s (also the use of the word &ldquo;like&rdquo;).</p>
<p>I could see glass augmenting socialization rather than obstructing it.</p>
<p>Well, rolling your eyes as a sign of derision or contempt has been around a lot longer than the 60s.  One just has to watch just about any Little Rascals episode to see that.  It&rsquo;s a basic human reaction, sometimes involuntary.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in a conversation with someone face to face, and you keep looking up at the Glass display, it&rsquo;ll be interpreted that way, at least until the person tells you to take them off.</p>
<p>It would give someone the same &ldquo;He&rsquo;s distracted&rdquo; effect as looking at your phone, even if you had it below the edge of the table/counter, or how some people get caught up looking at their own reflection when you talk to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the looking around that makes you a bad conversationalist, no one&rsquo;s accusing you of that &ndash; it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;appearing to be paying attention to something else&rdquo; that makes the other person in the conversation feel secondary.</p>
<p>The thing is, no one who&rsquo;s caught up in this Google Glass hype is ever going to admit they share the same concerns as the critics, and you&rsquo;ll just have to experience the problems when this thing actually comes out. In 2014.</p>
<p>I feel like human interaction is so much more mutable than people are willing to admit. The problem with looking down at your phone is that you&rsquo;re obviously looking for another form of interaction.</p>
<p>With glass, you might be looking for another form of interaction (although limited without you actually engaging the glass by voice or gestures), or your interaction with the world might just be augmented by glass constantly so that glass might <span class="caps">ENHANCE</span> social interaction.</p>
<p>ok you&rsquo;re reallly stretching now</p>
<p>How is that stretching? You have incredible access to information and people without having to obstruct your field of vision.</p>
<p>Looking directly into someones eyes for more than a few seconds is uncomfortable and a sign of aggression.</p>
<p>You mad doggin me bro?</p>
<p>Not looking someone in the eyes is a sign of weakness or deceit&hellip;.</p>
<p>Correction: <strong>Refusing</strong> to look someone in the eyes is a sign of weakness or deceit.</p>
<p>In other words, not enough eye contact is bad. Too much eye contact is also bad.<br />
Don&rsquo;t stare at someone&rsquo;s eyes the <em>entire</em> time you talk to them. And don&rsquo;t spend the entire conversation avoiding eye contact either. You have to do both, strike a balance.</p>
<p>Conversation master.</p>
<p>Never said that when having a conversation you have to stare into the other person&rsquo;s eyes the entire time. My point was that the <strong>particular</strong> method of breaking eye contact (regularly looking up and to the right) might be even more annoying than someone referencing a phone &ndash; because you&rsquo;d be more likely to do it more often &ndash; and from Joshua&rsquo;s video, it&rsquo;s <strong>definitely</strong> noticeable.</p>
<p>Question is &ndash; was Joshua exaggerating that glance or not? From Google&rsquo;s promotional material it seems like the Glass overlay is a <span class="caps">HUD</span> that is visible at all times &ndash; but from Joshua&rsquo;s vid, it looks like you actively have to glance up at it in order to see it properly (which actually I prefer &hellip; except in conversation ;-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;M <span class="caps">STARING</span> AT <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">NOW</span>.</p>
<p>No kidding. At least you know 100% that they&rsquo;re not paying attention when looking at a phone, unlike with Google glass where they can lie and pretend they are.</p>
<p>A couple of days back I would have agreed with the parent. It seems like it would just make you more feedback dependent to always see notifications, as opposed to being forced to check them on your phone, but after recently getting my Pebble I was surprised to find it has the opposite effect. About 70% of the notifications I get don&rsquo;t need to be acted on right away, being able to glance at my wrist and then ignore them means that I still feel on top of what&rsquo;s happening, but I&rsquo;m 70% less likely to need to bring out my phone and break my immersion. Even though I&rsquo;ve experienced this, it still seems somewhat counter intuitive.</p>
<p>If 70% of the notifications you get don&rsquo;t need action right away, it begs the question &ldquo;Why do you get them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simplify.</p>
<p>Because you don&rsquo;t always know which ones are immediately actionable?  A text may or may not be work related, for example, depending on your work, of course.</p>
<p>Exactly. The other part is that some work emails are just updating me on status, which is important for me to be peripherally aware of, but requires no immediate action.</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s the same feeling I have about my notebook compared to my smartphone. If I use the notebook to check Facebook, Twitter, Email, etc, I kind of feel obligated to spend more time in it due to the hassle of having to turn it on, sit down and browse. If I just use my cellphone I get through the same things much quicker. Just unlock it and go. I belive the transition to Glass from smartphones will feel the same. Things like taking the cellphone out of your pocket, unlocking it, using it and putting it away again will become a burden when compared to looking up to your glass. The smartphone will become a device you will only use when you have free time for real reading and other things that require the screen and touch capabilities.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good chance we&rsquo;re all going to look like we have lazy eyes when Glass goes mainstream.</p>
<p>Good thing I already have eyes that seem to be independent of each other!</p>
<p>This is assuming, of course, that the people are looking at their phones because they want the time/weather and aren&rsquo;t simply passing time while not wanting to interact with the strangers around them.</p>
<p>Consider this: most people who poke at their phone while in line are doing so because it&rsquo;s a fantastic way to make a boring task (waiting in line) go quicker or at the very least make it more entertaining. How does Google Glass fix that? Does it suddenly make you want only 5 seconds of data and interactions with all the strangers around you? Google Glass takes browsing a twitter feed and makes it look more awkward as well as complicates the task entirely.</p>
<p>I think the point of google glass is to engage with a person while still being constantly engaged in a conversation. Glass could serve to be the over-mind of all social interaction.</p>
<p>One great example I&rsquo;ve heard is people meeting up for an activity waiting for other people to arrive. You could have a seamless &ldquo;hanging out&rdquo; experience before, during, and after an event.</p>
<p>Another could be waiting in line with strangers and instead of engaging the news or games by yourself, engaging with them as a shared experience. I often have communal conversation with people from work around a cell phone playing youtube videos. Glass might make that less awkward.</p>
<p>Depends if you need a display while your hands are busy with something else&hellip;  Like surgery&hellip;</p>
<p>You never have to look at your phone just to know if you missed something.  Then using your phone for something you don&rsquo;t need to since you checked it for no reason.  That would give back people many hours of their lives.</p>
<p>It only takes me 2 seconds to see if there a notification on my phone and if it&rsquo;s worth diving deeper in.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to wear glasses on my head to save me from taking 5 seconds to check my phone?</p>
<p>Seriously.  Google Glass, as some mass-market-appeal device, is up there with some of the lamest ideas I have ever seen.  This idea is so painfully stupid &mdash; what about the half of the population who don&rsquo;t wear glasses of any sort?  Or the half of the half who do, who wear contacts instead of glasses?  How can anybody think people who don&rsquo;t wear glasses will start wearing empty frames so they can &lsquo;life cast&rsquo; their boring lives?</p>
<p>Yes, it is a great idea for avid skiers, sky divers, surgeons, etc&hellip; but for the general marketplace?  Google is jumping the shark.  Don&rsquo;t get me started on the Pixel&hellip;</p>
<p>A wrist-based smart device is such a better idea.  It can be worn by anyone regardless of pre-exisiting condition, it is unobtrusive &mdash; unlike the &ldquo;Google face tumor&rdquo; (seriously, will anything scream &ldquo;dork&rdquo; louder than this thing?) would be a &ldquo;style-improver&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;style-destoyer,&rdquo; would be less distracting and more naturally interacted with (I&rsquo;m supposed to talk to my glasses?  Stroke the temples? I am laughing just writing this&hellip;) It is such a bad idea I can&rsquo;t write about it anymore&hellip;</p>
<p>Please, Google, make a watch platform instead&hellip; please? Integrate Google Now.  Partner with actual watch manufacturers &mdash; I want a high-end smart watch with LG&rsquo;s circular <span class="caps">LCD</span> so badly it hurts (I&rsquo;m looking at you Breitling or Rolex).  So. Much. Better.</p>
<p>And Brin looks like such a tool in that rig&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree with the watch platform being less &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; than Glass, and I&rsquo;m sure it would look very sharp. However, I prefer Glass as I&rsquo;ve not worn a watch in years. Breitling makes stunning time pieces, but until I find a line of work that will pay more, I don&rsquo;t see myself owning one unfortunately &ndash; I&rsquo;m working on it though</p>
<p>To me, the biggest &lsquo;fail&rsquo; regarding GGs is based on a personal (though broadly applicable) anecdote:  I don&rsquo;t wear corrective glasses.  Sure, G-Sunglasses would work, but I wear sunglasses about 5-10% of the day, at most?  I don&rsquo;t know who thought someone like me would wear &ldquo;fake glasses&rdquo; for the remaining 60-65% of the day.  And if it is not persistent (as in I am supposed to put them on and take them off constantly), what is the point?</p>
<p>A watch goes on in the morning and comes off at night.  It is there all day without making itself known.  Sure a lot of people have ceased wearing traditional watches, but that is because they only told time &mdash; something many have noted they can now do with their phone.  A smartwatch is brilliant because it could do so much more.  It creates a reason to wear it, and yet, it is not outside either the common social norms (face wart) nor contradictory to style norms &mdash; a good looking watch is always a nice addition.</p>
<p>As for price and such, I hope there is a &ldquo;G-shock&rdquo; caliber, affordable version as well as a high-end luxury version.  I think it is something that nearly every phone owner would benefit from and shouldn&rsquo;t be limited to luxury use.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed&hellip;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Because unlike a smartphone, you can&rsquo;t do much with it. And what you can do with it, you&rsquo;ll be bored by a day or two.</p>
<p>I doubt I can play games, check twitter, facebook, etc and millions of other things on those glasses. They are cool, but not to compete with a cell phone. Duh.</p>
<p>Probably wouldn&rsquo;t be <strong>that</strong> hard to build Twitter and Facebook apps for it, right?</p>
<p>Exactly, the dictation on Google now is scary accurate at times. It would be nothing to say &ldquo;Glass update twitter .. headed to the airport now &hellip; send&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t care, then stop following me, you weirdos.</p>
<p>I think that one of the big problem is dictating your messagge while you&rsquo;re with other people</p>
<p>and then 100,000 token was used :D :D :D will twitter block the glass?</p>
<p>Agreed. Those glasses will never replace cell phones. At most they may exist together. <br />
The main thing is a smartphone can get away whenever necessary easily unlike the glasses which will be on your head. Of course you can remove them but then whats the use of making them in first place?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the people said about phones when they came out: <em>But it can&rsquo;t use photoshop&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Yeah, but these glasses will be banned from a lot of places &amp; you will still have to resort to using your phone in those situations. Business have an obligation to respect the privacy of its customers &amp; employees &amp; there is no way to ensure that people aren&rsquo;t being recorded on private property without consent. No business is going to what to risk a lawsuit because people wearing these in there store. I also know I won&rsquo;t patron businesses that don&rsquo;t ban them. I also suspect that we see a rise in questions of public voyeurism laws at the state level.</p>
<p>There is a blinking light on the front to indicate that it&rsquo;s recording, but nothing that $0.01 worth of masking tape can&rsquo;t hide.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right.  The Segway was supposed to revolutionize transportation until everyone banned it.  After that, even the people who could get over the ridicule of being seen in one lost interest in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the people said about phones when they came out: But it can&rsquo;t use photoshop&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep, that&rsquo;s what <span class="caps">EVERYONE</span> was saying about phones&hellip; /s</p>
<p>Voice command interaction is not as clear as UI based interaction. You can&rsquo;t glance at your tweets when they show up one at a time on that tiny ass glasses screen.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with the nervous habit line; take for instance, going out to dinner with a group of friends. It seems that everyone is turning their phone on every few minutes to make sure that they didn&rsquo;t miss a text, tweet, Facebook message, etc. instead of being in tune with the people who are actually around them. This in turn leads to seemingly uninterested parties who are more interested in what&rsquo;s going on in places that they&rsquo;re not at instead of focusing on the great company they have with them.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;ll see if something like Google Glasses fixes that problem, or makes it even worse. Maybe instead of glancing down at a phone, we&rsquo;ll all be staring off to the upper right corner of our field of vision to see what&rsquo;s going on with your notifications.</p>
<p>Or you could turn your phone off while at dinner. Trust me, 1 hour not checking FB updates or twitter wont hurt you.</p>
<p>But I need to Instagram my food.</p>
<p>No you need to feed your Instagram.</p>
<p>You statement isn&rsquo;t exactly contrary to my point.</p>
<p>How about those on-call 24/7? Can&rsquo;t turn off your phone.   However I still manage to not bring it to the dinner table, just keep it within eat shot.</p>
<p>eat shot :) Typos are funny!</p>
<p>So you don&rsquo;t agree with Sergei then. You know people will behave the same, they will be looking up and right(glass) instead of down and right(phone).</p>
<p>Anyone wears that to dinner doesn&rsquo;t get invited again, that&rsquo;s for sure. We&rsquo;re human beings, not robots.</p>
<p>But imagine if there was a Google Glass app that showed you nutritional information on the fly, or showed you what would be better choices to eat instead&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; or if it stopped you because you didn&rsquo;t realize you were about to eat this <del>-</del></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://home.insightbb.com/~jmengel4/bread/bread_jesus_p.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You sound like you have dinner in some kind of &ldquo;vote off the loser&rdquo; scenario.  Where do I sign up?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen this with Bluetooth headsets.  I was walking around* the other day when someone with a headset on was trying to get my attention.  I thought he was just talking to an invisible friend and it took a few tries before I realized I was being talked to.</p>
<p>*It needs to be told:  I was taking my son to Fry&rsquo;s so I could pick up a microSD card, and the guy who stopped me opened with &ldquo;Excuse me, sir?  Would your son like some Pop-Rocks?  They&rsquo;re vitamins.&rdquo;  I tried to back away slowly before I realized I was on the receiving end of an awkward Amway pitch.</p>
<p>True story.</p>
<p>instead of texting or tweeting or snapchatting, wouldn&rsquo;t they just all be talking to send those messages? That could get annoying <span class="caps">FAST</span>.</p>
<p>How does putting it in your eye solve this problem?</p>
<p>Sergey Brin is slowly becoming Tony Stark.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/ngyjVc2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The portrayal of Tony Stark in the recent movies is directly based off of Elon Musk, according to the director.  But, this is awesome too.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is terrible&hellip;. Sergei is better&hellip; Stark even better :) RDJr the best</p>
<p>i wonder when they are going to release <span class="caps">JARVIS</span></p>
<p>Word. <strong><span class="caps">JARVIS</span></strong> Siri meet your match.<br />
That would be a cool commercial</p>
<p>Completely agree with Brin here, I&rsquo;ve been saying this for a while.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 22 years old and I cannot think of one of my friends that hasn&rsquo;t pulled their phones out if something awkward or uncomfortable happened. People nowadays look at their phones because as a society we&rsquo;ve become so accustomed to this fixation of swiping between homescreens, flicking through menus, etc whenever we don&rsquo;t want to pay attention to or participate in whatever&rsquo;s happening in front of us.</p>
<p>Hoping Glass solves this disconnect.</p>
<p>What am I supposed to do in the elevator? Talk to those icky people?</p>
<p>If you stand uncomfortably close to them, they&rsquo;ll go out of their way <span class="caps">NOT</span> to talk to you.</p>
<p>Stand in the back corner of the elevator and face the corner.</p>
<p>Try <a href="http://9gag.com/gag/6664546">this</a></p>
<p>So we solve the problem of people looking at phones but putting their &lsquo;phone&rsquo; right in their vision where they can look at it even more constantly.  Sounds logical to me&hellip;</p>
<p>Making a distraction easier to see/interact with is supposed to fix the problem of people going to that distraction? Sounds like odd thinking. Glass is putting that distraction front and center. It enhances that problem, not eliminates it.</p>
<p>Exactly. Why not just be honest and say that Glass is simply a cool pair of glasses that provide information at a glance? Why try to pitch them as some sort of a solution to the social phenomenon of people checking their phones, when if anything, Glass seems like it would be <em>more</em> distracting than a phone, which can be placed in a pocket/briefcase/purse?</p>
<p>Google is trying <em>really</em> hard to convince people that Glass is the future, but I just don&rsquo;t see Glass having any appeal outside of a niche group of users.</p>
<p>No, Sam&hellip; It just might make it harder to <em>notice</em> the disconnect, but there will still be &lsquo;disconnect&rsquo; with Google Glass.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re incredibly naive if you think Google glass will &ldquo;solve&rdquo; this.</p>
<p>How would it solve anything though? The focus of distraction just switches from a piece of glass and metal to a piece of glass in front of your eye. I don&rsquo;t see the improvement in that sense. (Obviously I see the benefit of the tech &ndash; just not how it helps in this area).</p>
<p>Next time your with a group of friends and something &lsquo;awkward or comfortable&rsquo; happens within that group, bring it to the forefront.  If someone is being a jerk, actually point out that you&rsquo;re going to do some tweeting until the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>For example, pull out your phone and say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t mind me, I just gotta tweet this hashtag drama&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know what usually happens?  The person being a jerk will apologize, and it breaks the tension. That&rsquo;s been my experience.</p>
<p>So instead you&rsquo;ll have the person opposite you thinking, &ldquo;What the fuck is he looking at with that thing? Is he looking at my hair? No, he&rsquo;s looking at the display. What&rsquo;s on the display? Is he looking at miniporn? Sunuvabitch!&rdquo; A distraction is a distraction is a distraction. Moving it from your hand to your brow isn&rsquo;t removing it. (And yes, I know you can&rsquo;t watch miniporn on it&hellip;yet.)</p>
<p>So now with Google glass people can become even more obsessive about checking for notifications. Thanks Google!</p>
<p>More obsessive, but also more discreetly.</p>
<p>This will make cheating on tests less distracting for others around me whilst I do it.</p>
<p>Yes I&rsquo;m sure all your teachers will allow you to wear a head-mounted computer to your exams.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of the project. Head-mounted computers have existed for awhile now. Google Glass is the first real attempt to take them mainstream. By gen. 2 these things won&rsquo;t look terribly different from a normal pair of Warby&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Smartphones already <span class="caps">ARE</span> mainstream. Does that mean you are allowed to use one during an exam? Of course not.</p>
<p>This is not the point I am making. Wearing a pair of glasses is less obvious than holding a smartphone.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not. You can hide a smartphone under your desk and glance at it discreetly. You can slip it into your pocket when the teacher walks by. In contrast, anyone who can see your face is able to tell you are in possession of a wearable computer.</p>
<p>Google went from this:<br /><img title="" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2211355/GoogleGlass_19.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>to this:<br /><img title="" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2215649/GoogleGlass_15.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>in two years.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think a pair of glasses will be more discreet than a smartphone within the next two years when they look like this:<br /><img title="" src="http://www.selectism.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/warby-parker-2011-eyeglasses-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Thus is modern technology.</p>
<p>And flying cars are always 10 years way.  Glass depends on that prism sticking out in front.  Notice how much thicker it is than a normal lens?  Google would need transparent circuit, oled, and battery technology thats years from existing and even farther from being economically feasible for a consumer product.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just be glad that the people actually working on this at Google are smarter, have more resources at hand, and a better vision for this than you or I.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just throw money at this problem.<br />
It&rsquo;s simple physics, not supply line or technical efficiency.</p>
<p>Years from existing? I&rsquo;m guessing you haven&rsquo;t seen this: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/15/3966950/will-we-see-a-transparent-phone-polytron-prototype-display" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/15/3966950/will-we-see-a-transparent-phone-polytron-prototype-display</a></p>
<p>You cannot put that in a pair of glasses. Your eye cannot focus on something that close. A transparent display isn&rsquo;t the issue here, what Google is using isn&rsquo;t a simple transparent display, it&rsquo;s more of a projector.</p>
<p>Actually flying cars have existed decades&hellip;. but they are more of a airplane than a car. Technically they do exist but what people really would like to have is a current car without wheels and it would otherwise hover 30cm from ground and allow user to fly at max 200m altitude or just hover there as easily as now driving a car.</p>
<p>You have great imagination.. Yeah right, Google will solve all engineering problems like battery capacity etc.. Hell they might even change the laws of physics.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;just&rdquo; laws and Google seems to be good at breaking them.</p>
<p>And if the tech becomes that discreet, then schools will put restrictions on them.</p>
<p>Because wearing a head mounted display is the epitome of discreetness</p>
<p>Exactly this. Google is talking about how Glass will help break the barrier of technology and how the world will become more social again.</p>
<p>Google Glass will do the exact opposite. Instead of putting &ldquo;technology&rdquo; in your pocket an having to take out your smartphone instead it will push that technology in your face for every second of the day, more easily accessible than ever.</p>
<p>So instead of people looking on their phone they will stare in the distance more frequently. How is that going to help?</p>
<p>Look Google, Glass is really freaking cool. But don&rsquo;t dress it up as a solution to a problem it will only make worse.</p>
<p>Mobile phones already toke social life away by most parts, Facebook toke it even more and now social life is 5-10% of what it use to be 20 years ago&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but Google Glass is Kick*** technology but I find it very hard to believe Google Glass would fix that. Constantly being plugged in would absolutely create even more anti-social behavior. Having a <span class="caps">HUD</span> right in front of your eye just gives you more excuses to not pay attention to the world around you and stay in lovely blissful techno lalaland. It&rsquo;s a great idea but it would be a lot better for industrial customers instead of consumers. Design a Google Glass with satellite uplink and I wouldn&rsquo;t have to fly abroad all the time to inspect the holdings in Africa and China that the fund I work at owns. Or doctors, or consultants, but consumers it just screams 100000000 times worse than a cell phone. I think wearable technology has a place in our society, but it&rsquo;s not for the everyday consumer. My fiancee rues the day she fell for a tech lover and when I told her about google glass she up front said if I buy those I&rsquo;m never getting sex for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Agree. I can&rsquo;t see how voice interface is cooler than silent touch. You&rsquo;re sitting in the bus and talking to your glasses while people around you want to sleep during the travel. But this device is really cool for someone who works with their hands busy &ndash; some sculptors, workers, builders, engineers etc. They can see a blueprint, a map, a project in front of them while doing their work. This is where lack of control over interface is not big of a deal.</p>
<p>It also has a multi-function button interface.</p>
<p>To extend your point, Glass would also be useful for law enforcement (cops can record interactions with civilians to avoid credibility issues if the cop has to testify as a witness in court); real estate agents (they could show a property to clients who are to far away from the property to view it in-person); medicine (a doctor can record a complex surgery for other doctors/students to learn from); and of course, the porn industry (use your imagination&hellip;).</p>
<p>There are very practical and useful applications for Glass, but those glasses will not solve the problem of people constantly checking their phones.</p>
<p>This, This, This!</p>
<p>Sex &gt; Glass</p>
<p>Truestory!!!</p>
<p>What all do you think Google Glass will do. There won&rsquo;t be anything to do on it. Just notifications and such. Nothing to interact with, it just gives you a few less reasons for you to get out your smartphone by taking care of the notifications and such. That&rsquo;s the main reason I get out my phone, to check if I have any notifications. And then I have my phone out, so I might as well see what&rsquo;s new on The Verge or [insert social media site or news site].</p>
<p>But, if it gets much more than notifications and such, then it will cause more anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>Just imagine Glass with an Youtube app. Awkward moment arrives: &ldquo;Okay Glass load up latest edbassmaster video&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This featureless touch, Brin claimed, is why his wife still uses a Blackberry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A BlackBerry and Google Glass: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI_YGDMvlNY" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI_YGDMvlNY</a></p>
<p>lol that was awkward. She&rsquo;s pretty cool though, that was quite nice of her.</p>
<p>On the other hand, talking to her glasses during a conversation is just rude. Even worse than looking at her phone.</p>
<p>Is it as rude as pulling someone out of going in to a party with a camera in her face?  She was kind of demonstrating for the guy.</p>
<p>Are you moronic?  It&rsquo;s <span class="caps">TMZ</span> and they were specifically asking about the device.</p>
<p>Eh&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t rude at all. She managed very well use glasses without actually losing eye contact of the person and disturbing his questions and pulling smartphone front of the camera to take picture of questioning person.</p>
<p>The irony</p>
<p>Emasculating?  Really?</p>
<p>Yeah, I found that an extremely odd comment also.</p>
<p>Try chopping wood or spreading your handkerchief over a puddle for a damsel with a phone on one hand. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s pretty accurate.</p>
<p><img title="Overly manly glass" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1I2u473K0g1L2S0v3I38/Image%202013.02.27%2012:48:57%20PM.png" alt="Overly manly glass" /></p>
<p>I dunno I&rsquo;m starting to reconsider</p>
<p><img title="Punch UI" src="http://i.imgur.com/vJz55nW.jpg" alt="Punch UI" /></p>
<p>And then he goes on to say his wife still uses a blackberry because of the emasculating experience of a touchscreen.  Does he mean husband there?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;emasculating&rdquo; is the word he was really looking for.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;his wife still uses a Blackberry&rdquo; ??? Buuuurrrrn!</p>
<p>As far as being distracted, Glass is not all that different. Your brain is still processing information and you really can&rsquo;t be fully processing two simultaneous visual inputs fighting for your attention. Even if you&rsquo;re not actively looking at Glass, your brain is still subconsciously &ldquo;multitasking in the background&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, that&rsquo;s a stupid argument. We fidget at our handsets now, and with Google Glass, we&rsquo;ll have a nerve-wrecking, ever-ticking visual layer of notifications always hovering in front of our eyes.</p>
<p>Yes, please, sign me up!</p>
<p>Google Glass is going to be great for QR-codes, they&rsquo;ll just be auto-read while you walk by&hellip;</p>
<p>If it has auto-search like Goggles, trips to Ikea will look just like the Furni scene from Fight Club.</p>
<p>And the mall scene from Minority Report.</p>
<p>How is it emasculating?</p>
<p>And further, who cares if it&rsquo;s emasculating?</p>
<p>Brin clearly seems to care since that&rsquo;s what he called the experience of a touchscreen.</p>
<p>Except he keeps using that word, I don&rsquo;t think it means what he thinks it means.</p>
<p>Certainly not me, since I&rsquo;m a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I whip this out and look as if I have something important to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s what I do. Brin, on the other hand, probably actually has something important to do.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s absolutely correct but it needs to be clarified that the cell phone is a nervous habit unless it has Google Now because for without its aggregation of information a simple appointment requires nervous habit of factoring in other things going on, traffic getting to the destination, fumbling to pull up the address on maps while trying to navigate there, etc. when Google Now factors all that in for you and reminds you when to leave considering live  traffic condition to get there on time and has a convenient card showing the directions.  Google Shades take it to another level mainly because it frees your hands to interact with people, shake hands, hug, etc.</p>
<p>Yes because that&rsquo;s what millions of people spend countless hours doing on their smartphones: looking for directions and traffic info. Maybe Google Now could just preemptively write Facebook posts for you based upon where you are, or preemptively beat level 6-1 of Angry Birds Rio since that&rsquo;s probably what you want to do anyway. Maybe Google Now for Google Glass could just have the conversation with the person in front of you for you. Google Now is a cool, and so is Google Glass, but neither will <span class="caps">EVER</span> keep people from using their phone as a &ldquo;nervous habit&rdquo;, when they are bored, or to remove themselves from their situation.</p>
<p>For millions of people not living in traffic-less rural towns they do rely on maps and life traffic on a daily basis as it could mean a typical one hour commute versus three hours and their job because of failing to constantly poll traffic condition for freeway construction, accident, etc. and getting trapped. Google Now tells them what they need to know when they need to know it and with less fiddling with the phone to make life easier.  That was just one example as same can be said with flight reservations and countless other cases but you choose to be ignorant and knock it probably because your handset doesn&rsquo;t support it.</p>
<p>Google Now is a great product. I&rsquo;m not knocking it. I&rsquo;m knocking the idea that something like Google now or Google Glass are going to solve people&rsquo;s social issues. If you can&rsquo;t turn off or ignore your phone when you are talking to someone, how are you going to ignore it when there&rsquo;s a little transparent cube in your peripheral vision constantly? The solution is in the person, not the technology.</p>
<p>Lol what? The vast majority of people are driving in a city they know about, and if they&rsquo;re driving in the city, they already know the traffic is gonna suck, because, well, the brain is a really powerful dedictive tool, if you just use it.</p>
<p>Double <span class="caps">LOL</span>&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Has this been an issue for you?  &ldquo;sorry, I&rsquo;d hug you, but I really <span class="caps">HAVE</span> to post this to Instagram this second&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>rolls eyes</strong></p>
<p>After looking at Mrs. Brin&rsquo;s encounter with <span class="caps">TMZ</span>, saying things out loud to the Glass when someone is talking to you (and the eyes are not quite looking at you) is as annoying as glancing down at your phone when someone&rsquo;s talking to you. You are distracted either way.</p>
<p>I think one would need something like Myo wearable controller to control the Glass non-verbally. (But you can&rsquo; avoid the fact that you are still distracted.)</p>
<p>Wow, just seen that video. Disturberly unnatural. Very few people could currently pull that off and still look half way cool. I&rsquo;d say Google should wait for more exposer for Google Glass before selling it to the masses.</p>
<p>This reminds me of Miyazaki saying touchscreens are masturbatory</p>
<p>Trade every last remaining shred of privacy in our everyday lives for a cool little gadget?? Wow, that sounds awesome!! Where does the fanboy line begin? <a href="http://t.co/MqxeaMfNSY" target="_blank">http://t.co/MqxeaMfNSY</a></p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/hqY3kASMFW8" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/hqY3kASMFW8</a></p>
<p>They should use this for advertising for Glass actually. Well if it had a rearview cam. But actually a lot of it works anyway.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Or you could just enable notifications and have a special sound for important things, so you don&rsquo;t have to watch out for things happening all the time. People staring at their phones are just randomly browsing the web or messaging friends. Google Glass won&rsquo;t fix that. Also, how is shoving the computer IN <span class="caps">YOUR</span> <span class="caps">FACE</span> supposed to help?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad not everyone is buying this straw man argument. This is marketing posturing and nothing more. Google Glass does look like a cool product, but it is not going to make your life or conversations better.</p>
<p>Agreed, it&rsquo;s a sale pitch. Now it solving an issue is debatable. Seriously though they&rsquo;re testing the market for Glass. If they were sure they&rsquo;s sell them now and let the market decide.</p>
<p>Their approach is to get people use to the concept without actually using it.</p>
<p>Notice how he&rsquo;s rocking Crocs on-stage, what a boss</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Not even a high-tech billionaire can make Crocs cool.</p>
<p>Google Glass could be a huge flop for Google. As a society we might not be ready for this tech, I see this getting banned in many public places.</p>
<p>He mentioned that cell phones are a nervous habit, so would that make Google Glass a nervous tic?</p>

<p>that reference was the intent</p>
<p>He would be wise not to be too partial about the use of smartphones as Google&rsquo;s spokesperson. If Google Glass doesn&rsquo;t catch on (there is no guarantee that it will) we&rsquo;ll probably all be using smartphones for some more time to come and Google will be happily serving those customers.</p>
<p>On a completely unrelated note: why are tech moguls all using the phrase &ldquo;connect with the people in your life&rdquo;? I hear this in the most unconvincing Mark Zuckerberg voice possible and it always makes me cringe.</p>
<p>a slab touchscreen phone IS featureless, so why has everyone given up on physical qwerty phones :-(</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s emasculating so his wife uses a blackberry ? Yet brin a full touchscreen phone ? Lol I can who wares the pants in the family.</p>
<p>Brin is so butch he can emasculate himself with a touch screen and still rate .8 Chucks on the Norris scale.  I&rsquo;d sure as hell marry the man, even if it did mean I had to use a blackberry to be masculine enough for him.</p>

<p>Kinda ironic that a pop up banner about getting scroogled is blocking my ability to read an article about google. Making a point about being intrusive by being intrusive.  I think the banner is scroogling me more right now than google.</p>
<p>I know they&rsquo;re trying to push Glass as the next level of where technology is going &mdash; wearable tech being the next logical step &mdash; but isn&rsquo;t it a little too early to be bagging on smartphones when your company has an entire line of Nexus products that is apparently worried Samsung is getting too powerful?</p>
<p>The bigger question is: will Google allow outside developers to use the Glass OS to make their own Glass-es? If they&rsquo;re worried about Samsung it&rsquo;s probably a good idea to keep the Glass OS in-house.</p>
<p>I could only assume that Glass would stay in-house</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s emasculating?</p>
<p>the nuclear wedgies that&rsquo;ll be administered to the nerds who walk around school with those things on</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to look impossibly fly riding my Segway with my Glass. Maybe I&rsquo;ll bust out my Newton and Microsoft Bob while I&rsquo;m at it.</p>
<p>Good God, some of the comments in this thread about Glasses &lsquo;enhancing&rsquo; real life interactions suggests to me there&rsquo;s a bunch of people reading tech blogs that are <span class="caps">REALLY</span> socially awkw&hellip;. wait&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking advice on &lsquo;cool&rsquo; from a guy with a computer on his face?</p>
<p>The problem with the current Google Glass is that it is the equivalent of taking a smartphone display, shrinking it and sticking it in front of your face &ndash; its too &ldquo;In your face&rdquo;! It is no less rude or distracting that having to stare down at your smartphone, in fact it might be worse since you can ignore a smartphone in your pocket, you cannot ignore something stuck in front of your face in a place which is neither in your line of vision nor totally out of it. In fact if you look at Josh in his Google Glass article video, he needs to look up and stare to figure out what the Glass&rsquo;s display is showing &ndash; now try doing that while having a conversation. Google Glass basically fails to solve the scenario the Glass designer talked about &ldquo;people in her bus stand all staring down at phones&rdquo; becoz now they will all be staring up above your head! ;-) And with their current prism based display technology, I don&rsquo;t see how they are gonna solve this problem. Good luck to Google coz they need it!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re supposed to cheer on whatever Google does, or you get labeled a Luddite.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see that I&rsquo;m not the only one that views it this way. I don&rsquo;t believe that Google glass will do anything other than exacerbate the &ldquo;anti-social&rdquo; behaviors that we now exhibit with cell phones. This is a great idea for some usage scenario I&rsquo;m sure, but definitely not at the consumer/societal level.  If it takes off it will be a nightmare! Although the YouTube videos of all the assholes wearing these things walking into water fountains, telephone/light poles and into canals will be far more entertaining!</p>
<p>Sergey is making the wrong conclusion from biased, out of context, data points.</p>
<p>The emasculation at Google is due to the toxic Trichloroethylene (<span class="caps">TCE</span>) vapors that have hit abnormal levels at Google HQ:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4018768/tce-vapors-found-in-google-mountain-view-office" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/22/4018768/tce-vapors-found-in-google-mountain-view-office</a></p>
<p>Lower sexual drive and fertility problems are known side effects of <span class="caps">TCE</span>. It&rsquo;s not from rubbing smartphone screens.</p>
<p>Google Glass come with 802.11 b/g 2.4 GHz <span class="caps">WLAN</span> and low-energy Bluetooth 4.0 radio. But the most interesting aspect is the single mention of a &ldquo;vibrating&rdquo; element for transmitting sound to the user via bone conduction.it looks like <strong><a href="http://www.hardwarezone.com.sg/tech-news-google-glasses-be-equipped-bonephone-technology?utm_source=blogcomment&utm_medium=SEo&utm_campaign=SG">Bonephones Read More&hellip;.</a></strong></p>

<p>She &ldquo;glass eyed&rdquo; me = someone I was supposedly talking to was just pretending to listen, and instead checking her facebook update.</p>
<p>I have been inspired to invent my own wearable tech idea:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wearable Wi-fi Coldspot&trade;&rdquo; &ndash; aka <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">HUMANIFIER</span>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a small chain you fit round your neck and which, when you breath out twice in quick succession (a breathing-double-tap (tm!), surrounds you with a 2 minute personal wi-fi coldspot&trade; preventing anyone standing in front of you from being online. The deluxe model also blocks mobile broadband.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">HUMANIFIER</span> will guarantee that you can hold a conversation with even the most addicted social media junkie, no matter how wearable-teched up, by simply blocking the continuous feed of tripe that ordinarily would be pouring into their poor addled heads.</p>

<p>Then stop making Android for touchscreens. He&rsquo;s only complaining about touchscreens to prop up interest for his glass project.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Know what&rsquo;s &ldquo;emasculating&rdquo;? Selling ads for a living ;-)</p>
<p>this defeats the purpose of having an &lsquo;always on&rsquo; thingie on your face 24/7, but on the other hand when you are talking to other people or in a restaurant or the locker room, you can just choose to be less of a distracted butthole. you see, unless the glasses are surgically grafted on to your temple, you can take them off, the way you put phone/s away in your pocket when you are not using it/them (or more realistically, you want to conserve battery for the trip home). there&rsquo;s a wide variety of accessories already available : for example : <img title="eyeglass case" src="http://www.myeyeglasscase.com/images/catalog/live/imageLibrary/B6CAE9531517598184122F0BBBF2619DL.jpg" alt="eyeglass case" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt a smartphone to be emasculating, nor have I heard other people complain about it.  If it wasn&rsquo;t a problem up till he mentioned it, I don&rsquo;t see why it should be treated as a problem now.  It&rsquo;s all perception anyway and his statement is no more valid than some other guy claiming that those glasses make you look like an idiot.</p>
<p>So he doesn&rsquo;t like touchscreen smartphones and his own wife won&rsquo;t use them, something he seems to agree with.  Does that mean he is telling us to stop using Android?</p>
<p><span class="caps">COMPLETELY</span> disagree that touch is featureless. Touch has it&rsquo;s place and is great for emerging form factors and different use cases we haven&rsquo;t even created yet. If anything, Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6cNdhOKwi0">Future Vision</a> videos show great proof of what multiple inputs can provide. The issue is not touch on the phone, the issue is us and just how powerful and how much a phone can do, and how we choose to use it. Glass could take some of that and make the device less needed, but it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if the phone is a blackberry or an iPhone or an Android. Touch is not featureless.</p>
<p>I have to say, the more I think about Google Glass the less I like it. There are so many reasons that this design is a bad idea.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the point of GG is to free us from the obtrusive nature of smartphones. You don&rsquo;t have to look down at your phone or disconnect from the world around you if the display is there on your face&hellip; OK&hellip;</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s go out in to the real world.</p>
<p>1. You&rsquo;re talking to a guy wearing GG; how do you feel? Do you like having a camera pointed at your face all the time? Right there, staring at you, a camera. It&rsquo;s the opposite of unobtrusive. If the computer is there on the dude&rsquo;s face then it&rsquo;s there all the time. At least with a smartphone you can put it in your pocket. <br />
2. The dude you&rsquo;re talking to is getting messages flash up on his GG screen. You can see, every few minutes, his eyes just slightly flick to the side as their attention is caught by a new notification. He ignores them, of course, he&rsquo;s polite. But you know. You know there&rsquo;s something else going on there and you don&rsquo;t know what. You&rsquo;re very aware that there&rsquo;re three of you in this conversation. <br />
3. Now you&rsquo;re wearing GG and you&rsquo;re walking down the road. You go to cross the street but then, at that very moment, you get a really interesting pop up notice. You&rsquo;re momentarily distracted and a car screeches to a halt just short of you! (surely it won&rsquo;t be long until we get a death blamed on GG distractions). <br />
4. It&rsquo;s all voice controlled (well, almost all). With a smartphone I can take a picture discreetly. With GG I have to say it out loud; &ldquo;OK Glass, take a picture&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s clunky. <br />
5. No way will regulators allow you to drive while wearing it.</p>
<p>I think GG will be socially awkward, expensive, limited and, at times, dangerous. A far more acceptable design would use an earpiece only for audio interaction, do away with the intrusive camera and use a wrist mounted touchscreen display for visual outputs and more subtle and less obtrusive control &ndash; after all, reaching up to your head to touch the button on the side is far less comfortable than tapping your wristband.</p>
<p>GG is fun and high tech, but it&rsquo;s not a mass market product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I understand it, the point of GG is to free us from the obtrusive nature of smartphones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah, the point of GG is to free you from the obtrusive annoyance of actively sharing your information. Glass&rsquo;s real purpose is to make everything passive, from sharing more information, to receiving it. I don&rsquo;t know who they&rsquo;re actually going to sell on this whole &ldquo;less obtrusive&rdquo; nonsense. It&rsquo;s the most obtrusive solution out there. It&rsquo;s literally putting those distractions constantly in your view. In doing so, they will effectively be forcing you to interact with the tech, which will be constantly phoning home to build their knowledge database of everything. I won&rsquo;t argue either way about the positive or negative end result of such a tactic, but that is it&rsquo;s number one goal; to feed the Google data machine in the way that requires the least amount of user interaction, because if they can make you forget you&rsquo;re feeding it, then you&rsquo;re vastly more likely to share more and more.</p>
<p>I rarely pull out my phone when I am in a social setting unless it is appropriate to do so. I&rsquo;ve never even really considered it. It just seems like extremely basic courtesy and etiquette. I mean, sure, it&rsquo;s okay once in a bit, maybe if the conversation steers towards phones and the internet and all people will all take out their phones and fiddle with them for a bit, and of course when people get up to goto the bathroom you&rsquo;ll often see phones getting taken out(though I still think that is kind of weird).</p>
<p>Brin has a point in that smartphone &lsquo;posture&rsquo; tends to be dismissive on its own. You get zoned in on this little device in your hand, your shoulders hunch over a bit, you look down&hellip;etc. That is a problem with social settings, but having a screen hanging on your face really isn&rsquo;t much better. It addresses the postural component but it does not address the arguably more important component which is that <em>you are in the company of another human being not on the internet</em>.</p>
<p>Glass may be a &lsquo;better&rsquo; way of maintaining connectivity in a social situation, but the point is that the need to maintain connectivity in a real life social situation is in and of itself a faux pas and something that we should probably <span class="caps">NOT</span> be trying to streamline.</p>
<p>Holy $#it!!! Look! It&rsquo;s Tony Stark!  XD</p>
<p>The glass stuff is cool&#8230;but they are still all using backpack units&#8230;</p>
<p>Give them some time!</p>
<p>Yea, they showed us camera. Nothing special<br />
She was even looking back on wall while she has a display on glass&#8230;.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe how jaded some of you are at just how cool it is to be able to take video and pictures without having to hold anything or have any real interference with you being able to enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>When I was at Coachella earlier this year I had a blast. I limited my picture and video taking because I wanted to enjoy myself more than just preserve it all in digital form. But just imagine how cool it would be to have everything I saw recorded to look back on after the fact from <strong>my own perspective</strong>, not hampering my enjoyment in any way.</p>
<p>Sure, the HUD stuff seems like it&#8217;s still really early stuff and that will be cool too. But the camera by itself is already freaking awesome. Way better than any other alternatives like a <em>comparatively</em> giant GoPro strapped on somewhere.</p>
<p>This is exciting stuff, and it&#8217;s really just an indication of what is to come. This isn&#8217;t the iPhone 4s or Galaxy Nexus of wearable computers, but it&#8217;s already pretty awesome.</p>
<p>I can think of very few situations (such as skydiving etc&#8230;) where the benefits of not having to hold a camera outweigh the desire for quality and control over your image.</p>
<p>And we already have those products for skydivers, skiiers etc&#8230; GoPros, like you said, this is just smaller. I&#8217;m not <strong>that</strong> impressed at a smaller gopro.</p>
<p>Also&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote>It can also capture video clips, although they appear to be very short — about three seconds</blockquote>
<p>Quality will come in time. I love how people tend to &#8220;review&#8221; a new tech gadget before they&#8217;ve even used it. I&#8217;m not excited for what Glass is, I&#8217;m excited for what it<em>will</em> be. Be it in it&#8217;s final, version 2, or some competitors form. This is just the first of it&#8217;s kind.</p>
<p><strong><em>Every</em></strong> situation would be better without having to worry about hold a camera to capture what you see. And short of mounting a GoPro on your head you&#8217;re not capturing that natural motion and perspective of the human eye. Which is really what makes this so special. It&#8217;s more than just smaller, it&#8217;s reached a level of unobtrusiveness that isn&#8217;t matched by anything else at the moment.</p>
<blockquote>Every situation would be better without having to worry about hold a camera to capture what you see.</blockquote>
<p>Utter rubbish, outside of &#8216;professional&#8217; filming even in consumer use, I can see no reason why it is better to have the camera on your face when filming something like a family event, or your cat doing something dumb.</p>
<p>The mentality being, if it looks good from your perspective, it will look just as good from your Google Glass. That is what is incredibly exciting. You are the literal viewfinder.</p>
<blockquote>if it looks good from your perspective, it will look just as good from your Google Glass.</blockquote>
<p>If only that were true.</p>
<p>Ever look out at an amazing view and then take a photo on your phone, only to have the scale and beauty of that scene totally lost in the crappy image?</p>
<p>I guess you missed my very first sentence in my initial reply. I don&#8217;t want to argue with you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not juist talking about the quality of the camera, I am saying that issue exists for everything but super high end cameras. Scale just doesn&#8217;t translate easily into photos.</p>
<p>i wish i was there to hug you. i feel as if we&#8217;ve lost you.</p>
<p>Qué?</p>
<p>You can get a little video camera that will record that kind of stuff for far less than $1,500 right now.</p>
<p>The Developer Edition is 1,500, not the upcoming consumer</p>
<p>First post I have seen that mentions some awesome possibilities for Project Glass.  Have to agree, I never got how people spent more time taking pictures rather than enjoying the event.</p>
<p>Inception.</p>
<p>Some of the bikers and repellers weren&#8217;t though. Odd.</p>
<p>were the backpacks femtocells or something?</p>
<p>to livestream i bet.</p>
<p>Yeah, what were they plugged into. In terms of demonstrating Glass and the capabilities Google suggested in their concept video it was actually pretty poor. As we know is the camera and transceiver work :-P</p>
<p>Right, I mean, right now, it&#8217;s just a camera with the ability to stream live&#8230;I suppose that&#8217;s useful for documenting a whole bunch of inane stuff&#8230;</p>
<p>Well .. thit is google.  They tend to over-promising and under-delivering.</p>
<p>This thing is no way near consumer ready.</p>
<p>Hey retardo, they specifically said this was a very early alpha prototype which is years from being ready. Don&#8217;t you have somewhere else to troll?</p>
<p>Sorry, this user is known troll, you now get a &#8220;tRolled&#8221; Badge. Wear it with pride.<br />
(Yes the &#8216;r&#8217; is capitalized)</p>
<p>Yo, Vic, I&#8217;m really happy for you, and imma let you finish, but I&#8230; Sergey Brin, had the best presentation EVER!</p>
<p>Well, they did succeed in doing the most dramatic 0 information presentation they could :)</p>
<p>The backpacks were most likely to ensure uninterrupted streaming during that chaos. Everything else is feasibly done through the device and a phone at this time so I wouldn&#8217;t be entirely too critical of the backpacks. Google showing of the technology in such a manner says they&#8217;re a lot further along than we probably give them credit for.</p>
<p>The backpack units are because there isn&#8217;t 3g coverage that high in the air. So they use the backpacks as antennas. On the ground, they wouldn&#8217;t need them.</p>
<p>Nope, there can be 3G coverage that high. I&#8217;ve been able to get 3G while in a commercial airliner, which flies much higher than where they jumped.</p>
<p>High fives! <br />

<p>That was the MOST EPIC Demo I HAVE EVER SEEN!. . . Google KILLED IT!</p>
<p>I agree. I enjoyed many Apple keynotes, but this is the best! That was awesome!</p>
<p>Will tune in to all Google keynotes from now on.</p>
<p>Wow, this is very impressive.</p>
<p>Is it though? Guess I just expected more than what you could already do with a GoPro and a cell phone&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;its the processing in real time, the search, the location and video object based search that makes is impressive.</p>
<p>Its more than a camera.</p>
<p>There was nothing of that sort demoed.</p>
<p>and you know this how? they showed sharing vid and pics.  No one told us what kind of stuff pops up on the screen.</p>
<p>Its been shown in previous demos&#8230;</p>
<p>Its been shown in previous demos&#8230;</p>
<p>Sure it is more than a camera, there is a backpack too :).</p>
<p>To paraphrase steve jobs, what have you done lately that is impressive?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen a go pro that could fit on your eyeglasses. Jesus Christ man, just give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>It is cool though. But not terribly impressive.</p>
<p>That was amazing!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KBNcZ.gif" /></p>
<p>LMFAO</p>
<p>I call fake.  No windows open like that.</p>
<p>And this isn&#8217;t the internet&#8230; <br />
<img src="http://www.webree.com/img/44365/~TheInternet.aspx" /></p>
<p>It bloody well is! It was blessed by Stephen Hawking himself! Now get it back to the top of Big Ben!</p>
<p>You mean the Elizabeth Tower that contains Big Ben!</p>
<p>Brofist.gif</p>
<p>Probably one of the best shows ever!</p>
<p>FCKN SICKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Hell yeah</p>
<p>Sergey now has Cirque du Soleil running scared</p>
<p>This is how to do an Event.</p>
<p>Yeah I wish more events focused on things you can&#8217;t buy or even try out. Oh wait, no, actually I don&#8217;t want that.</p>
<p>Oh you mean like the Nexus 7 and Nexus Q, plus the Galaxy Nexus with Jellybean that they&#8217;re currently handing out? Or do those not count because then your trolling doesn&#8217;t work?</p>
<p>I believe they also have a demo booth showcasing Glass as well.</p>
<p>Did someone add that to Cinemagraphs? That would have been a great segue.</p>
<p>That was fucking epic.</p>
<p>Glad i decided to watch the stream. That was pretty impressive.</p>
<p>that was too dope</p>
<p>I was like &#8220;oh&#8230; it&#8217;s probably time sensitive because they are about to launch it to the web&#8221;</p>
<p>And then they jumped out of an airplane. That was awesome.</p>
<p>That was epic. So epic.</p>
<p>Epic. Most epic demo I have ever seen in my life. Totally and truly impressed.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RlSrD.jpg" /></p>
<p>No coincidence that Stark has a striking resemblance to Sergey&#8230;</p>
<p>I want to know, where&#8217;s the source of infinite energy? And the R8 v10?</p>
<p>This</p>
<p><img src="http://images.seroundtable.com/sergey-google-suit-1339156419.jpg" /></p>
<p>that was fast.  and awesome.  well done.</p>
<p>someone elses work, I don&#8217;t take credit, leagal this legal that. ;)</p>
<p>Sigh, last year that time around, we&#8217;ve been that close&#8230;just wished we had that corporate power behind us! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZLmNHoT2lE" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZLmNHoT2lE</a></p>
<p>The people showing off google glass need some serious public speaking help&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, yet to see any Android@Home stuff.  Last year seemed like a cool idea, and now there is nothing to talk about.  Must&#8217;ve been stillborn.</p>
<p>Sadly, that happens a lot with google.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s day 1. There&#8217;s more to come. Google TV, I&#8217;m sure Android@Home, Chrome, etc.</p>
<blockquote>There’s more to come. Google TV, I’m sure Android@Home</blockquote>
<p>People were saying that at IO last year.</p>
<p>Is it just me or is this thing basically the eyePhone from Futurama?</p>
<p>depends &#8230; did you want them to shutup and take your money?</p>
<p>Hey, did you guys know that Google Glass can take pictures? And video? And pictures? Check out these pictures. You can take pictures with it. And video. It can take pictures.</p>
<p>Yeah, I want to see how it benefits me.  Pictures and vid&#8230;.fine.  I want to know how I use it day-to-day.</p>
<p>Just a look at the interface would have been nice.</p>
<p>THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY VGA PHOTOS EVER.</p>
<p>Yep, I wish that the resolution and color gamut had more to do with the quality and breadth of the camera experience, too. \s</p>
<p>Google has transcended tech.</p>
<p>HAHA<br />
They just took a page out of Apple&#8217;s playbook&#8230;</p>
<p>You mean Passbook?</p>
<p>I mean, that was a facetime promo video with a wearable camera instead of an iPhone.</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Sergey Brin = Tony Stark</p>
<p>1500 bones&#8230;.ouch.</p>
<p>$1500!</p>
<p>Can I get that developers discount Google?! Lol.</p>
<p>GoPro makes better wearable HD cameras, and their livestreaming kit retails for $99.</p>
<p>Glass is more than just camera. I&#8217;m pretty sure there would be some kind of Android installed on that device.</p>
<p>it should be an android companion so you can use your phone from your glasses with a fine tuned UI.</p>
<p>that should also make it much cheaper.</p>
<p>Will be cool for sports, action oriented things, tutorials etc&#8230; needs to be useful outside of recording video, reading txt messages; should be a pair of glasses or sunglasses; not just an add on, I don’t need to carry around another device just to stalk somebody/something.  Why would I wear these to work or out to dinner? Who wants to be the creeper recording EVERYTHING? The one photo shows 2 people on a date; do you need an instant replay to see if her joke was really that funny?  I understand the idea but I don’t get it.</p>
<p>The Date reminded me of The pocket stenographer sketch on the Chapelle Show&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to wear one of these playing hockey though.</p>
<p>okay, the demo is impressive, but it&#8217;s actually more about how cool your life is with extreme sports than the device. what is that about? glass-mount camera? wow, well, that&#8217;s boring. I thought PG is about augmented reality but google has not show anything more than promises. If they cannot really deliver that, than don&#8217;t try!</p>
<p>It is interesting to see Google shifting to the actual human element, very Apple-esque.</p>
<p>I think this is what you call KILLING IT</p>
<p>Google Glass needs to be standard issue to Police Officers. Both from a HUD perspective for the officer and recording their actions (and the actions of the people they deal with).</p>
<p>That was one extreme demo that was executed to perfection.  It&#8217;s not very often you get to see a OMG moment watching a keynote presentation.</p>
<p>Seems like a really nice product. Will love to see more improvements before i goes on sale to public.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not that impressed by this. There aren&#8217;t that many things that I want to record in my daily life. I&#8217;m all for pushing technology forward just for it&#8217;s own sake but I&#8217;ll be much more impressed when I see some of the HUD features realized. So far, this has only live-streamed video and my smartphone already can do that.</p>
<p>Like I said above, a great application for this will be in Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>Was kinda disappointed. I was expecting to see a demo of the capabilities of the glass. Guess the title of the video is correct though &#8211; it&#8217;s a Skydiving Demo.</p>
<p>They missed an incredible presentation opportunity. Instead of turquoise Glass they should&#8217;ve brought Nexus 7 Tablet and continue presentation with it. Now that would be an epic way to intro a new device!</p>
<p>Tech shown = VGA camera live streaming = MEH<br />
Demo = Skydriving+Stunt Biking+Rappelling done to perfection = HOLY COW!</p>
<p>OMG JEK PORKINS IS BACK? (Link photo)</p>
<p>Okay Google is just the coolest fucking company at the moment! That keynote rocked!</p>
<p>Reminded me of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MR4R5LdrJw" target="new">Phil Schiller jumping off a ledge</a> at an Apple keynote back in 1999. Insane demo. Glass has the beginnings of something really cool, potentially revolutionary.</p>
<p>Relevancy fail.  Notice how no one responded to your comment?</p>
<p>You did though&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>It can also capture video clips, although they appear to be very short — about three seconds</blockquote>
<p>So what was this stream showing? Just some people skydiving wearing the glasses but the livestream video wasn&#8217;t from said glasses?</p>
<p>Google glass will give us the most amazing POV porn :D</p>
<p>so it&#8217;s a wireless GoPro?</p>
<p>They need to get the camera in the mid point of the two glasses and hide everything else within. They look too damn dorky otherwise.</p>
<p>porjected glass is a headmounted camera? that sucks.</p>
<p>Sergai makes for a horrible commentator. Just get out of the way, don&#8217;t say a thing.  What is on the screen needs no commentary.</p>
<p> You don&#8217;t need to apologize for how long something incredibly fucking cool is taking.</p>
<p><img src="http://danselden.me/gopro.jpg" /><br />
unfortunately has no filming capabilities outside of what the gopro provides but awesome that you can hook up a gopro and join a hangout</p>

<p>Those GoPro&#8217;s are there because it is actually the GoPro BombSquad who made the jumps in the vids.</p>
<p>I want this to be the future so badly&#8230; Google, use your awesome (?) marketing skills and put on the heads of every man woman and child.</p>
<p>Who reckons josh put his pre order down?</p>
<p>business expense!</p>
<p>yeah, im sure he put his pre-order on some glasses that has a worse resolution than those bulky head-mounted displays that can be worn to see a full HD video</p>
<p>itll probably just shove google+ in your face randomly because noone actually goes to google+, so they figure the google fanboys who buy this plastic piece of crud will go to google+ if they get reminded of it 24/7 in their face</p>
<p>Wow&#8230;..<br />
Bitter much?<br />
Who took a dump in your morning Cherrios?</p>
<p>Just check his post history. It&#8217;s par for the course. Hell, it&#8217;s actually one of the more tame responses he&#8217;s conjured up.</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s probably the user once known as &#8216;Tablet&#8217;.</p>
<p>Project Glass (or something like it) is going to own the future. If you can&#8217;t see the potential in it then it says far more about you than it does about the product.</p>
<p>This will definitely sell well, when implemented in standard eyeglasses and sunglasses.</p>
<p>It might catch on if they can find a way to make a version that doesn&#8217;t make you look like an idiot while you are wearing it. As it is, it is a cool geeky toy, but it wont have mass appeal.</p>
<p>Did a search company touch you in your sleep or something? Your holding on to a lot of anger there</p>
<p>ASSUMING CONTROL.</p>
<p>Resistence is futile. We have found another way!</p>

<p>Yes, until you change the perspective</p>
<p>&#8220;Scouter&#8221;, the first app specifically for Google glass.</p>
<p>If it isn&#8217;t I will be severely disappointed.  All it needs to do is flash Over 9000!</p>

<p>&#8230;and, done. From now on, humorous and absurd predictions of the future will overlay this image.</p>
<p>This needs to be combined with &#8220;You don&#8217;t know what I know&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting idea, but not much there to be a product now. Waiting for Google to add actual features so it becomes usable.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s devs-only for now.</p>
<p>well, there are already plenty of augmented reality apps. the trick is, and it is up to google, how to push the device out there. standalone? upgraded handsfree?</p>
<p>I believe more elegant way, now, would it to make it a smartphone extension. devs would only update their apps with the support of the second head up display and camera. android is already very popular and would make sense it to become a part of the ecosystem. and you, as the consumer would be forced to buy android (nexus) as well.</p>
<p>but in this scenario, the device would be limited by the substance of android &#8211; the openness . it would be much easier for apple, but google would have to depend on certain devices (bluetooth 4.0, ice cream sandwich, enough power) , maybe nexus-only. standalone device would work anytime.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s up to google, maybe it&#8217;s much more simple and I&#8217;m just making up problems where they are not. anyways, I am superexcited about this, suddenly, in next few years we could really get the sci fi technologies we were dreaming about into real consumer life. cool</p>
<p>This is actually a very insightful comment. I agree and hadn&#8217;t thought of this.</p>
<p>I believe it is meant to be a companion device to a phone or tablet. As a stand-alone device, it is likely to be too bulky to be attractive/useful.</p>
<p>Augmented paintball wars.    :D</p>
<p>Sweet! They suit you, Josh.</p>
<p>Put it on the Vox corporate card. Do it.</p>
<p>Josh should pre-order one to give to Paul that is specially programmed with hundreds of thousands of gifs.</p>

<p>omg awesome</p>
<p>Looking ever so dapper Josh, per usual.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/afSa8.jpg" /></p>
<p>Project Glass is secretly a brain-copying device! Sergey now knows what Josh knows!</p>
<p>he already did lol. google docs, gmail, his nexus&#8230;..brin knows what&#8230;YOU know. :)</p>
<p>A v neck, denim/burlap looking shirt unbuttoned and aversion to sunlight is dapper?  Can the new 80&#8217;s move on already?</p>
<p>evil hair</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be sweet if it could work as prescription glasses as well? (thinking of Josh here)</p>
<p>That would be awesome. Partner with some opticians so people can order them with prescription lenses built in.</p>
<p>I think it can be built that way when it comes to consumers</p>
<p>omg what a creepy smile! looks cool, probably just a gimmik</p>
<p>No, this kind of technology is most likely the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m yet to see anyone in them who doesn&#8217;t look like a colossal berk. Sorry, Josh, but that includes you.</p>
<p>I love the idea, just&#8230; meh.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly. I kind of get that &#8220;douchebag who uses a bluetooth headset 24 hours a day&#8221; kind of vibe from Project Glass.</p>
<p>Hammer, meet head of nail.</p>
<p>man, you really come out in full force to troll google articles.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t make it them wrong&#8230;.I initially thought hipster douche</p>
<p>Pardon me? I didn&#8217;t realise that thinking wearing <strong>any</strong> kind of product like this looks lame was not considered trolling against Google.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t give a crap if Google made it or anyone else, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that I get a (as so well put by CPD_1) "douchebag who uses a bluetooth headset 24 hours a day" kind of vibe from Project Glass.</p>
<p>You really don&#8217;t need to get so offended about any negative comment about a product made by the company you sadly &#8216;side&#8217; with.</p>
<p>How would anyone see you in the basement when you are wearing them?</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>I never understood what people hate so much about having their hands free when they are on the phone&#8230; I love it, seems really useful to me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine in the car,  or working or something. But we all know the guy that wears it at the dinner table or to family functions thinking that whatever call he&#8217;s gonna take is so important that he needs to be able to take it at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>
<p>Convenience and safety are one thing. Douchebaggery is another.</p>
<p>BORG</p>

<p>Needs a blinking blue light and a Corona Light.</p>
<p>I hope these things don&#8217;t cost around 1500 when they are released but based on what the price for beta versions am guessing it will be about the same or more. DOA</p>
<p>What the hell are you talking about?  A prototype device is ALWAYS ridiculously more expensive than the final product.</p>
<p>Okay then. You are beta testing a device and paying 1500&#8230; sounds legit.</p>
<p>You are getting a limited edition, pre-release device, and you want it to cost less?  Sounds legit.</p>
<p>Most of the people that buy this will use it to get early development time.  Priceless if that&#8217;s your thing.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that many of the devs who buy these will use them to experiment with and then use as a tax write-off/business expense.  These aren&#8217;t supposed to be just consumers buying alpha models, but people who will actually create software for them.</p>
<p>Until one shows up on an extreme skier doing downhills&#8230;&#8230; or some such.<br />
Give it a couple weeks till we see one on ebay.</p>
<p>They are only making a few thousand prototypes. Devices don&#8217;t become cheap until you ship millions</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nothing when you&#8217;re running a business. Lot&#8217;s of people assume because the Android SDK is free that&#8217;s big boon, it isn&#8217;t. Big consumer-facing apps cost thousands of dollars to produce. A licensing fee just isn&#8217;t a big deal when you&#8217;re talking about paying your talent $40hr starting. At least as far as we know Glass will only be produced by Google, so it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re going to have buy up a bunch of phones like you have to for Android development.</p>
<p>Individuals are buying a jump start to learn the platform early, so they&#8217;re more likely to get first pickings when companies are looking to hire Glass talent. Compared to a formal education which is tens of thousands of dollars the price is a drop in the bucket. As long as the early adopters stick with it they&#8217;ll have tremendous employment advantage over the faint of heart.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll wait for the Ray-ban version, tnks</p>
<p>Where is the &#8220;deal with it&#8221; GIF with the Glass?</p>
<p>Bah. No matter who wears it, they will look like a supernerd until the device is invisible to the user.</p>
<p>Then I want to be Supernerd, a hero for the internet era.</p>
<p>I hope Supernerd leaves a trail of rainbow when he flies.</p>
<p>Of course, but there won&#8217;t be public acceptance for this until it&#8217;s &#8216;invisible&#8217;.</p>
<p>Hence why they are talking to regular makers of glasses and sunglasses.</p>
<p>Remember all the people that used to wander around with bluetooth headsets when the manufacturers thought it was still a cool idea to put REALLY BRIGHT blue LEDs on them that blinked continuously and made the wearer look like a tool?</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t seem to care about that, I doubt they&#8217;ll care about Glass.</p>
<p>People may pay $30 for something that is useful and makes them look like a tool but I doubt they&#8217;ll pay $300-$600 for something that is useless and makes them look like a tool.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to them as to whether or not they deem it useful and/or value for money.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;ll take maybe five years of camera and computing advances before it&#8217;s at a reasonable stage.</p>
<p>I think it will be 5 years as well.  I hope Google sticks with the project.  I do see a day where these glasses will find their way into the mass market (maybe even contact lenses that do the same thing).  But it will take major hardware improvements to get there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good start, but it certainly did not warrant the stunt show that was dedicated to it, especially since as it was shown, it was merely a camera streaming footage.</p>
<p>GoPro already have that market covered with the HD Hero2.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right. And since there is nothing in Google Glass that will make developers money at this point, this was a Microsoft-level smoke and mirrors segment.</p>
<p>Either way it was still cool.</p>
<p>Ya, I&#8217;m excited about it, but so far it just doesn&#8217;t seem far enough along to be bringing it up at events.  Reminds me of their map technology, everyone watched their maps incrementally improve for years to the point that they seemed head and shoulders above the competition.  Then, apple makes a mapping technology that seems better and they announce it in one day as opposed to dragging everyone through the process for years.  Both companies have their pluses and minuses, but I prefer seeing a finished product and then having it available right away.</p>

	<li>Do you really expect someone to buy the Nexus Q at 300 dollars?</li>
	<li>You don&#8217;t know what I know.</li>

<p>Does Glass come with a free Optigrab?</p>
<p>I was born a poor black child&#8230; and i had hotmail</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure Maps knows where to find Pizza in a Cup.</p>

<p>Taking a kind of already nerdy guy and made him look a thousand times more nerdy,  I&#8217;m sorry but sometimes style (even on prototypes) should matter &#8230; so ugly!</p>
<p>$1,500 for this ugliness? Bwhahahaha . . . .</p>
<p>$1500 for developer prototype.  Starting to think people are being purposely ignorant just to make snarky comments</p>
<p>ding ding ding.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that catering to the verge&#8217;s user base?</p>
<p>Oh I&#8217;m sorry, it isn&#8217;t shiny enough for you.<br />
Speak to Mr Ive about it, I&#8217;m sure he will give the thing lens flair.</p>
<p>Sorry but Apples game plan has changed, now they just change a little feature on the same old iPhone and call it innovation.</p>
<p>Sorry if its too ugly for you all, but damn is Google ever innovating their shit all over Apple these days.  By the time project Glass makes it to the public, expect it to be half the size and look way better.  I am sure the products for on your prescription glasses will be mostly contained between the frame and your head. <br />
I can&#8217;t wait to see how this progresses.</p>
<p>Based on what I&#8217;ve seen from io and wwdc, both companies have great stuff in the <br />
Pipeline.  And apple holds their cards closer to the vest, so they probably have more products that aren&#8217;t shown.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the first to say it&#8230; Apple would never release this gewgaw until it was much more developed&#8230; but then again, I don&#8217;t see them releasing a glasses based &#8216;computer&#8217; anyway.</p>
<p>There not &#8220;releasing&#8221; it. It&#8217;s a prototype that is only available for IO attendees.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the whole point. Google is releasing a rough prototype&#8230; not even a decent beta, which means at minimum 5 years before they can decide if this is even something worth pursuing.</p>
<p>It may end up as a niche item for nurses, dentist&#8217;s assistants, car repair shops, McDonald&#8217;s workers&#8230;. you get the idea.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a different philosophy, and don&#8217;t assume one approach is better. Google is constantly using the &#8220;beta&#8221; monicker, and releasing things before they are fully cooked. They do this to get user feedback, conduct broader testing etc. before the consumer version rolls out.</p>
<p>In this way Google products are informed by practical use and user need, whereas Apple is more about telling you what the experience should be and release products once they meet the need that Apple has internally defined. Different approach, each valid in their own way.</p>
<p>Google has always done public R&amp;D, which is what this is. They are selling these to DEVELOPERS.</p>
<p>Is working on the next Android version in secrecy until the release considered public R&amp;D these days?</p>
<p>Google has been working on this for years. Besides, what does all these have to do with Apple?</p>

<p>Hey, we wanted a picture of you with your glasses on AND this one</p>
<p>Let me buy this Google!!</p>
<p>make one side with x-ray vision and I&#8217;m in!</p>
<p>The whole &#8220;chest hair poking out of the shirt&#8221; look has got to stop, Josh.</p>
<p>Get over it.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.picasion.com/pic55/ead8203d9047804ac5809010c6f0ec86.gif" /></p>
<p>Proof of brain downloading in progress, telltale twitch</p>
<p>His brain is melting!</p>
<p>Josh looks strange without glasses.</p>
<p>Seems that a lot of people miss the point of a dev device, if it gives you the jumpstart on making a compelling app that brings in revenue, then 1500 doesn&#8217;t seem too shabby to me&#8230;  Just sayin..</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to need mass market penetration here.</p>
<p>Which it won&#8217;t get.</p>
<p>Not in its current form or society.</p>
<p>how do you know?</p>
<p>The public will not use it until there is a compelling case for it in everyday use. It certainly couldn&#8217;t be used while driving. Too risky.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d use it while driving. Speedometer app for heads up display? Heck yeah. No more taking your eyes off the road to check your speed. And navigation? Same deal.</p>
<p>Because no one has to think very hard to know this.</p>
<p>Even at $500, you&#8217;ll see very slow adoption. Once it hits the $150 to $200 range, you&#8217;ll see greater acceptance. That takes time because engineering and computing needs to catch up to where they want this to be.</p>
<p>The developer edition is pretty much just a PR exercise to establish that the &#8220;glass&#8221; will forever be identified as a Google innovation even if they can&#8217;t execute faster than other guys,</p>
<p>I honestly think that Glass has the potential to change life as we know it. I also think it could take another 5 to 10 years before they iterate and get costs down to consumer level. In the meantime, &#8220;Glass&#8221; belongs to Google even if Apple or other guys get their consumer grade goggles out first.</p>
<p>And 1st person video recording is probably the least exciting thing in the glass project for my money. An intelligent heal-tracking HUD is as compelling as tech comes.</p>
<p>head-tracking</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that trying to establish themselves as &#8216;the&#8217; goggles company will work unless they also deliver something that the mainstream finds compelling. At one point tablets were MS&#8217;s big idea but they couldn&#8217;t put everything together into a compelling product and now Apple dominates the space.</p>
<p>The concept is already perfectly formed, and Google were the first mainstream tech company to sponser such a project. Even if they fail to execute, the concept was already introduced by them so therefore any other company producing &#8220;goggles/visor&#8221; tech will be known as a &#8220;Glass clone&#8221;. These days an early public prototype gives you bragging rights as an innovator even before the implementation is acceptable.</p>
<p>i see as crowdsourcing the R&amp;D</p>
<p>The crowd won&#8217;t be working on the engineering, just the software side.</p>
<p>I came to the comments for Josh reaction images, you guys are seriously letting me down!</p>
<p>When they can make the cable less intrusive, I&#8217;ll be all over one of these things!</p>
<p>I hate to say this but glass will be the new blue tooth headset allowing people to easily identify who the tools are while waiting in line at McDonalds</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Law enforcement will be all over this.</p>
<p>what i woud like to know before anything else</p>
<p>WILL IT BLEND ?</p>
<blockquote>Yes. It will blend.</blockquote>
<p>how about the glasses, will they blend?</p>
<p>No, they will only stand out like a big black wart.</p>
<p>But can it play crisis?</p>
<p>just when you thought J-Tops couldnt look any nerdier&#8230;..</p>
<p>White and nerdy&#8230;&#8230;. White and neerdy&#8230;. Sent via weird al</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely content to wait this out and see what Google does but I&#8217;ve already resigned myself to assuming this won&#8217;t come to much and will be discontinued in a few years. Unfortunately that&#8217;s par for the course with Google. The original promo video that we saw promised a lot and I&#8217;m worried the product won&#8217;t be able to deliver.</p>
<p>If the heads up display mechanics were integrated directly into the glass I could see this being useful.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t see the cyborg eye thing being something that catches on. I&#8217;ve yet to accept the wireless headset as something people should just be&#8230;wearing&#8230;.everywhere&#8230;they go (yes, you people are annoying).</p>
<p>But if they just looked like glasses then they might turn out to be awesome.</p>
<p>It is also not an insignificant mark against the product that they are actually glasses that must be worn to be functional. People who don&#8217;t normally wear glasses all the time will not accept Google Glass for this reason alone.</p>
<p>That should&#8217;ve said &#8220;&#8230;<strong>may</strong> not accept Google Glass&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well?  Does it have the potential to be cool?  Or is it just suck?</p>
<p>Cool&#8230; no.</p>
<p>Porn.. yes.</p>
<p>Give it five years, then we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not convinced  that having a projector pointed at  your eye all day long will be very healthy.</p>

<p>1_ Josh seems to exhibit a pinkish hue in these pictures, is that a weirdness with the white balance or is this his (un)natural color?</p>
<p>2_ Is it in fact <em>just</em> the glasses, it is not even paired to a smartphone or anything?</p>
<p>i can see straight away that Josh wants some gLass big time</p>
<p>Did he use his Galaxy Nexus to take these photos? It looks better than the usual GNex photos I&#8217;ve seen. <br />
I&#8217;m getting those glasses once it&#8217;s out. Not the expensive explorer edition.</p>
<p>Looks fantastic, as with a million other gadgets that I have bought over the years, &amp; which have ended up in the bottom of a drawer, only to be rediscovered a couple of years later and with the added question; Why on Earth did I buy that?</p>
<p>because at the time&#8230; you could has that.</p>
<p>More like a &#8220;heads on&#8221;</p>
<p>Damn I read this hoping to get a description of what the actual UI looked like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming, according to the last sentence.</p>
<p>The UI is Google Now.</p>
<p>I think it would look better if there was actual lenses in the glasses.<br />
Also, Do they work with an external battery pack or all they fully contained.  Is the wire a charging cable?  Do the glasses work without the cable?</p>
<p>Do the glasses function without wires attached?</p>
<p>I would rather borrow Sergey&#8217;s wallet than his glasses.</p>
<p>Price is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Josh actually looks like Sergey. If Sergey became a drunk, grew out a beard and began living behind a trash can.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going out on a limb here, and take a chance at sounding like a fool 5 years from now when everyone is waring these, but &#8220;Project Glass&#8221; is the biggest, dumbest piece of bull shit I&#8217;ve seen in a looong time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious as to what powers the device, how long is the battery life and how do you charge it?</p>
<p>Awesome. Competition will only speed things up.</p>
<p>True, True, but it looks like google has to keep biting themselves in the but for their billion dollar open source project, people keep jacking it lol.</p>
<p>We shall see if Google will be able to make quality product.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t see this stuff going anywhere. If you can take an attractive woman like that and make her look like an idiot you are doing something wrong. Also see: bluetooth headsets.</p>
<p>The utility of these things far out-weighs the initial stigma.</p>
<p>Sure&#8230;<br />
<img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5A5m51C3fBc/Rnic11HKHKI/AAAAAAAAANE/WHWU79KKnBw/s400/toshiba-mounted-display_48.jpg" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what it looks like.</p>
<p>The utility of these things far out-weighs the initial stigma.</p>
<p>:P</p>
<p>You&#8217;re obnoxious.</p>
<p>&#8230;.and you&#8217;re tersely defensive! :-)</p>
<p>I remember that image being associated with some then-unreleased video game console.</p>
<p>Was it Kinect?  Wii?</p>
<p>Dan we will need Project Glass if there is ever a zombie apocalypse to give us maps, compass, ammo and health.</p>
<p>The utility seems largely overblown. If people aren&#8217;t capable of texting and driving (in some cases texting and walking) how do you think these devices will fare?</p>
<p>These might make it easier to do both of these things if you don&#8217;t have to move your head, and can still see what&#8217;s going on in the background?</p>
<p>I think people will simply be more easily distracted. This type of technology has applications in specific industries, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see people walking about with this stuff day to day &#8211; not for the foreseeable future, anyway.</p>
<p>This is possible, but the market will decide. I&#8217;m predicting it will decide that it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sceptical too, but people do use iPads to take photos and wear bluetooth headsets etc</p>
<p>None of these &#8220;people&#8221; should qualify as people. If you have ever found yourself taking a photo or video with a tablet, please walk off a cliff.</p>
<p>yeah, unfortunatly i use one and helps alot when A) Driving and B) at my job (which you probubly dont have one) so tell me again how im not a person?</p>
<p>I assume you are talking about bluetooth headsets (I really hope you aren&#8217;t driving while taking photos with an iPad). Assuming that, then there is nothing wrong with A, or B. The only situation I&#8217;m talking about is the people who wear them when they aren&#8217;t using them to seem important.</p>
<p>IMO blu-tooth headsets <em>can</em> be useful especially for online gaming.</p>
<p>Right, but in that case you are actually using it. Not just walking around town looking like a pretentious douche.</p>
<p>They are just having their spy/secret service fantasies.</p>
<p>These will be amazingly helpful with augmented reality type stuff. The problem with AR apps at the moment is you have to get your phone out of your pocket and point it at a desired interaction. For example look at layar, that would be amazingly helpful as a HUD, but kind of annoying to use on your phone.<br />
I ride motorcycles and go on big sunday rides, often times I find I have no idea where I am. I&#8217;d like to be able to look in directions and know what landmarks lay ahead. And if I can talk with people and show them pictures while I&#8217;m riding all the better!</p>
<p>This is probably a good use scenario. I&#8217;ve been thinking that they&#8217;re designed to be worn all the time, but maybe it will just be something that you wear on certain occasions?</p>
<p>I reckon it might become something people find their own way of using it, and the social interactions will make them wear it more and more until it just becomes the norm to wear it most the time.</p>
<p>I suppose they&#8217;ll get less and less intrusive over time too as the technology shrinks and becomes higher quality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll remain sceptical for now, but I would like to try it out.</p>
<p>The problem with so many of the detractors on these forums (and forums anywhere) is peoples lack of ability to think of use cases outside their own universe.</p>
<p>I too ride my motorcycle on my hour commute and weekend rides, and having maps/traffic would indeed be useful. Operators of heavy machinery, delicate procedures, interactive video training&#8230; I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of industries that could make good use of this.</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t look like an idiot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I chose my derogatory word properly. Would chump be more appropriate? Perhaps awful or terrible?</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t look awful, terrible, or like a chump.</p>
<p>Most tech enthusiasts look as good as her.  They could choose someone more realistic. <br />
she will do.<br />
<img src="http://www.xojane.com/files/sites/default/files/imagecache/article_full_width/field_image_attachments/article/watchmen.jpg" /></p>
<p>*Most tech enthusiasts do not look as good as her</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with this photo. She isn&#8217;t wearing stupid looking dork wear.</p>
<p>True dat.</p>
<p>except millions of people still use BT headsets every day. Just because you don&#8217;t have a use doesn&#8217;t mean there is no demand.</p>
<p>Yeah, but every single person that walks around wearing one even when they aren&#8217;t using it deserves to be beaten.</p>
<p>Really, WTF is wrong with you? Need attention? Think you&#8217;re cute?</p>
<p>Suck a tailpipe.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the people who wear bluetooth headsets when they aren&#8217;t talking on the phone are the people who need attention. Nothing says &#8220;look at me, I&#8217;m important&#8221; than someone pretending their time is so valuable they can&#8217;t even spend the time to receive a call.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re reading too much into what people do. My mom, for instance, wears her bluetooth all day long, because she&#8217;s a florist and is working with her hands, so she isn&#8217;t going to take it off and put it on every few minutes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess this could be the same for these AR headset devices. A lot of people will find them useful in their day to day lives and will use them, but will be mocked until they become boring technology, like bluetooth headsets.</p>
<p>But who is going to use them? I didn&#8217;t find the Google Glass video demo very convincing personally.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers seems like a good use case, where you need to track real events, and overlaid information is critical. What else?</p>
<p>Do you want your eMail popping up on there while riding the subway? Video chat? Games? Lots of possibilities but I&#8217;m not sure what makes sense, maybe all of them.</p>
<p>I can see it being useful for a lot of people, mostly it&#8217;s a matter of whether the cost hurdle is too great. various kinds of delivery or courier drivers, surveryors&#8230; don&#8217;t really know.</p>
<p>The whole &#8220;bt headsets are douchie&#8221; thing is old. the world has moved on.</p>
<p>Leaving an earpiece in that you aren&#8217;t using hasn&#8217;t stopped being douchey. It&#8217;s like saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m talking to you, but I have to be ready to drop everything for someone more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>sure thing bud. if you want to know something that definitely hasn&#8217;t stopped being douchey, it&#8217;s you. so hating on BT is sort of backfiring, because you&#8217;re definitely as or more douchey.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowldc/files/2012/07/douche.jpg" /></p>
<p>isnt this picture a shoop?</p>
<p>I think it makes her look cuter.</p>
<p>I think Google wants competition. If their master plan goes through without a hitch, people are going to be pretty wary.</p>
<p>Ah but you have missed the point of Google&#8217;s (multi) Billion dollar open source project, increasing access to THEIR services. If these other products let you search or use Google maps or other Google data, Google has achieved their aim. Google isnt planning on making profits based of hardware, or even actual software.</p>
<p>I hope everyone gets their patents in order.</p>
<p>You mean this patent by Apple <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8212859.html" target="_blank">http://www.freepatentsonline.com/8212859.html</a></p>
<p><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcn45nUSzw1rqx471o1_400.gif" /></p>
<p>Yikes!!</p>
<p>Wow, how often are we going to see Apple get a patent to something that has been around for decades in tons of products before Apple claimed the patent. What is next? Apple going to patent touching a digital or physical button in order to generate a text output, and then sue keyboard makers all the way back to the first typewriters?</p>
<p>lol Apple actually made that functionality with the Apple 2. Think Woz. So technically yes, they could patent it&#8230; although the time for doing so has probably expired&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>around for decades in tons of products before Apple claimed the patent</blockquote>
<p>Such as?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you know? Google Glass.. and.. and ..and .. and <strong>sigh</strong>&#8230; fanboyism has not trumped logic  :( :P</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vuzix.com/augmented-reality/products_star1200.html">Vuzix&#8217;s other products?</a></p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t anyone actually read the claims in a patent anymore?<br />
It&#8217;s an irrelevant patent.<br />
It&#8217;s for a two lens system that requires keyboard and or mouse input to interact.<br />
All the  processing is done outside the unit, i.e, it is not self contained.<br />
In other words, it is not the same&#8230; by a long shot.</p>
<p>To answer your first question, yes, but it&#8217;s more than just reading. It&#8217;s about comprehending how interoperable and broad Apple&#8217;s patent is. It was written in this manner for the purpose of future proofing.</p>
<p>Google version of the patent is specific and basically pigeonholed.</p>
<p>I need to know what it&#8217;s like to use one of these things &#8211; It&#8217;s pretty hard to imagine.</p>
<p>A HUD for maps, compass, ammo, health, etc..</p>
<p>Looks like it could poke you in the eye.</p>
<p>Yep. That&#8217;s what she said.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t understand how these displays work &#8211; can someone enlighten me?</p>
<p>It projects the image into your eye at a focus that makes it seem like it&#8217;s farther away than it really is.<br />
This doesn&#8217;t have a transparent module like Glass&#8217;, though.</p>
<p>Really?  It&#8217;s actually aiming a little beam into your pupil?  That&#8217;s impressive.</p>
<p>No. It&#8217;s just a display, the same as google glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Presented on an arm in front of your eye, a 16:9, WQVGA, full Color display provides visual access to your smartphone display, basic web content and other data fed to the smart glasses by your smartphone and on onboard applications.</p>
<p>The 16-degree field of view and bright display is designed for indoor and outdoor use.&quot;</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not using a lens system, it&#8217;s behind literally every HUD there is. Maybe they just neglected to mention it.</p>
<p>Woah! That&#8217;s even more futuristic. Holy crap!</p>
<p>And people laugh at those wearing bluetooth headsets, this is 100 worse but sign me up to this or google glass</p>
<p>Is it just me, or does this look way more intrusive into your field of vision than the Google Glass does?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s indeed position below instead of above your eye level then I imagine it would in fact be more intrusive. Simply because we tend to look more often down than up.</p>
<p>I think that can work in its favour too since looking at information on the glasses will be more like the natural reading position.</p>
<p>It also looks intrusive to me as well.</p>
<p>I agree. More often do we look downwards than upwards, so it would be smarter to hang the glass from above our eye so the frame doesn&#8217;t invade our vision</p>
<p>This looks absolutely terrible. And slapping ICS onto a heads up display is hardly competition for Google Glass. Google is doing so much more, and as a Google I/O 2012 attendee I can&#8217;t wait to get mine!</p>
<blockquote>Google is doing so much more</blockquote>
<p>Really? Like what? We have no idea what google glass can do apart for taking picture and hangout.</p>
<p>Nobody has specifics yet so let&#8217;s not kid ourselves.  I would however bet a large sum of money that Google will have the upper hand at the end of the day.  They can bury a company like this who 1) Has far less resources (aka: money in the bank, ability to outright buy companies, etc.) 2)Tight API integration to Android and the latest code (read: not ICS, but JellyBean, Key Lime Pie and beyond).  3)The co-founder of Google (Sergey Brin) at the helm of this project.    Look at the video on Youtube and you will see where Google is going.  They are not playing around with this one.<br />
In the next few years people will wonder why we ever carried around devices in our pockets and purses.  We will be wearing our &#8216;computers&#8217;.</p>
<p>Check the Wikipedia article, they&#8217;ve got more history and expertise than Google in this area, even if they probably don&#8217;t have the same levels of finance available. The military research connections are likely to be just as valuable as this in terms of R&amp;D though.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuzix" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuzix</a></p>
<p>I know (and i hope) that google are more likely to end up making a better product but saying right know that &#8220;Google is doing so much more&#8221; is just untrue. Except if he have internal intel&#8230;</p>
<p>Google are definitely building up their hardware expertise, but it&#8217;s still something they&#8217;re learning at. This company have been doing this for years and are getting involved in areas where the use case is much more logical, like air traffic control systems/</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they also bought a hardware company (Motorola) as well as have huge cash reserves to outright buy companies or tech they believe will complete the puzzle they want to build.  Yes, Vuzix has ties to DARPA. Google coincidentally just hired the former Director of DARPA.  Times are interesting indeed.</p>
<p>I think the best contribution that Google could make would be in adding features like Google Now, location aware services that build on the massive data they keep on their users.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;re getting much from Motorola except a bunch of patents but who knows.</p>
<p>I heard someone recently suggesting that Apple are working in this space too, but more secretly, like with the original iPod. Could be interesting.</p>
<p>They obviously gonna ad google now, when you look at the video mockup for the google glass  most of the feature that made people go &#8220;wow&#8221; are actually google now.<br />
About motorola they said that motorola is for them like any other manufacturer and they just bought it for the patents.</p>
<p>Point taken and agreed.  We don&#8217;t know all the details and probably never will until it&#8217;s a final product from both companies.</p>
<p>Like take a video- duh. /s</p>

<p>Chick is hot, device looks stupid. Google wins.. Done.</p>
<p>How does Google win? Glass also looks stupid.</p>
<p><em>Vuzix,</em> Rubio. NOT &#8220;Vizux&#8221;.<br />
<strong>Vuzix.</strong></p>
<p><strong>vuzix </strong>- correct the name</p>
<p>The price cut seems attractive, but then we&#8217;ll all be crying over not being able to update our glasses to Jellybean, KitKatBar, or Licorice Android. :)</p>
<p>Google Glass upside down&#8230;</p>
<p>lol at trying to compete with Google. Here&#8217;s a helpful tip Vuzix: you won&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>Does anyone really win when you&#8217;re talking about the world&#8217;s stupidest idea?</p>
<p>Yeah, wearable computing and eyewear embedded screens, how stupid.<br />
Next thing, you&#8217;re going to say interplanetary internet is useless.<br />
Try not to hate the future when you&#8217;re in it.</p>
<blockquote>Next thing, you’re going to say interplanetary internet is useless.</blockquote>
<p>Are you from the future?</p>
<p>Meh. I&#8217;ll wait for the neuro linker. All of these &#8220;glasses&#8221; are too inconvenient. Meanwhile, the neuro linker can even correct your vision so you don&#8217;t need glasses.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard of or seen Vuzix before, but they seem like the kind of company to come out and claim they have a groundbreaking product, release 1 more &#8220;prototype&#8221; image, and then disappear. Their website also looked shady.</p>
<blockquote>seem like the kind of company to</blockquote>
<p>Um, maybe try a little research next time, instead of jumping to conclusions just because you&#8217;re only aware of Google getting into this game after others have been doing it for a while.</p>

<p>Putting a hot girl in the photo isn&#8217;t reality. A middle-aged, overweight perv wearing them to take pictures of women like her &#8211; now that&#8217;s reality!</p>
<p>Can it really be called competition when nobody in their right minds would use these stupid things?</p>
<p>Competition is always good for the consumer.</p>
<p>The design looks way better to me.</p>
<p>If Google play their cards right, this could totally change the game. Go Google!</p>
<p>Having videos from sportive events (F1, sprints, &#8230;. ) has awesome potential !<br />
Boxing matches would also be fun but I fear there are some practical problems with that idea.<br />
Imagine that the next time you climb a mountain or descend rapids you are able to snatch a first person video.<br />
Google is on to something here !</p>
<p>You could attach this technology to padded helmets in a multitude of physically demanding sports like boxing.</p>
<p>NFL quarterbacks already have a mic to their coaches. It wouldn&#8217;t be a huge stretch to add a camera somewhere on the helmet.</p>
<p>There are already helmets with a camera, it&#8217;s not the main purpose of Project Glass.<br />
In my opinion, this technology is more about displaying than capturing.</p>
<p>It actually reminds me a lot of the gopro camera, but this seems like a much more natural way of doing it. Very nice google</p>
<p>Yes, it also reminds me of the gopro, the only difference is that it is only one of the feature of Google glasses. The GoPro will obviously produce videos of better quality since it has a bigger sensor and that is what really matters for video/picture but Google Glasses can touch a larger audience.</p>
<p>The video is great and everything, but I think the HUD and augmented reality features are the real killer. If they can make it user-friendly and useful for a mainstream audience they really could have something.</p>
<p>Agreed. No double there are lots of applications for POV filming / streaming, but this isn&#8217;t game changing. Camera&#8217;s were always getting smaller and lighter and more power efficient. So tiny camera&#8217;s that are wearable isn&#8217;t the game changer. It&#8217;s the added HUD / applications the unit can run to take advantage or receiving real time imagery, linked to GPS, and other sensors.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what i&#8217;m intreated in seeing.</p>
<p>But it is a game changer, because this is potentially something everyone will have eventually. Like how everyone now has a smartphone capable of HQ pictures and video. <br />
How many people do you know with head mounted, hands free cameras ready to take video or pictures at a moments notice?</p>
<p>okay, that&#8217;s like 10 years ago. F1, MLF, alpine ski racers already have helmet cameras. there the potential is in the way the content could be delivered ( where you, as the viewer are the director as well and could choose the camera, angle stats) that&#8217;s not the purpose of this, being just a handsfree with a camera. that could have been done a long time ago, and actually, I don&#8217;t know why has not.</p>
<p>this is about the augmented reality , HUD.</p>
<p>I have seen some experiments how these HUDs (possibly with 3d,  could totally change the way we treat out environment. virtual partitions, even whole buildings, signage, advertising&#8230;</p>
<p>conceptually, this is not new, why google is doing it now is, because the technology has become powerful enough to put this computing power and 3g/4g connectivity in a cell phone. it is a very logical step.</p>
<p>what will be cool, if the design is implemented into normal glasses. I dig the sci fi look, but many people dont. plus, I, as many, wear glasses and such upgrade would be a total lifestyle gamechanger</p>
<p>Does anyone else wish Google had shown what the AR overlay looked like as of now?</p>
<p>the video recording does impress me.</p>
<p>Me neither&#8230;. not sure what I was supposed to see there.</p>
<p>&#8220;does impress me.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Me neither&#8221;</p>
<p>I think you may have read that wrong, regardless I agree that it&#8217;s just a video of somebody trampolining which is not very exciting. I guess at least it shows video quality on the device.</p>
<p>Its impressive because it appears the wearer of the glasses is doing back flips.</p>
<p>And that the camera is steady as hell, so no blurry cams here.</p>
<p>yeah so it&#8217;s as impressive as.. go pro?  I watched the video wanting to see a virtual horizon overlayed or something at least.</p>
<p>The go pro doesn&#8217;t look incredibly comfortable to wear on your head. Come on people, really? Give it some credit.</p>
<p>The gopro also isn&#8217;t going to shatter if you fall over while trying to blink and nod your way into stopping the video you&#8217;re recording&#8230;</p>
<p>You couldn&#8217;t do any better than that?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s far too early in the morning. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how why they were filming Captain Morgan playing poker.</p>
<p>Finally, my needs of recording video while jumping on a springboard have been addressed!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a Negative Nancy&#8230; This &#8220;amazing&#8221; technology can apply to all kinds of situations:<br />
1. Jumping on trampolines<br />
2. Jumping on beds<br />
3. Jumping on grass<br />
4. Jumping on a pile of leaves.</p>
<p>Need I go on?</p>
<p>Jumping out of a window?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very odd you&#8217;d say that as I&#8217;m currently watching the 9/11 documentary video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXnA9FjvLSU" target="_BLANK">&#8220;The Falling Man&#8221;</a>, about the people jumping from the windows of the WTC.</p>
<p>As disturbing as it is, having technology like this during a crisis would put a whole different perspective on the situation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure someone would think about tweeting such an experience. then again, people are weird</p>
<p>Even with that exotic needs, a GoPro would be a better option&#8230; you can fit it on a helmet and you may need one jumpion on some of that places&#8230;</p>
<p>Is a gopro also going to do IM, maps and other functions in an augmented reality type of display? Folks its just a demo showing that the units make decent quality cams to go along with all the other features.</p>
<p><strong>ugh</strong></p>
<p>none of those features exist yet.<br />
So far, we know that the project takes video and photos. That&#8217;s all.<br />
Everything else was a nice piece of post production magic.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to wear a helmet.</p>
<p>Now what if people already have glasses?</p>
<p>They must probably use Contact Lenses.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to have to wear Contacts <em>and</em> glasses. They need to make prescription Google Glasses.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why they couldn&#8217;t. Hopefully they will. I definitely would be able to use them then.</p>
<p>Or maybe some sort of clip-on Google Glasses? I&#8217;d hate to not be able to use them.</p>
<p>clip-on&#8217;s are fugly</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll probably out a standard frame model and allow people to buy the frames and outfit the unit onto it; either that or send the frames in to be modified.</p>
<p>OR you&#8217;ll just have to buy new lenses, and Google will manufacture that on their side.</p>
<p>Just thinking for .4 seconds and throwing out something plausible <del>_</del></p>
<p>They have a patent for that. They will of course also have a solution for people that already wear glasses.</p>
<p>Do you really think that&#8217;s needed? It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re watching &#8220;through&#8221; these glasses.</p>
<p>First of all they aren&#8217;t really glasses. It&#8217;s a piece of glass attached above your eye that you can watch from time to time.</p>

<p>They said on their G+ account that they have various solutions for people who have prescription glasses (like me).</p>
<p>And me&#8230;this is great news&#8230;and the video quality is top notch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s acceptable. It&#8217;s not top notch.</p>
<p>Most of Google Engineers are nerds<br />
nerds mostly have prescription glasses<br />
people with prescription glasses are probabaly working on google glasses<br />
Google glasses will work for people with prescription glasses</p>
<p>How many fallacies?</p>
<p>Geeks! Not nerds. Geeks are into technology, nerds are into science .  There may be some cross over but there is a difference. then there&#8217;s always those hybrids.</p>
<p>Thank you Tom for linking back to us! And as I had said, we have expecting some more information from the Project Glass team in our interview. Also, they are now calling it Google Glass!</p>
<p>I think when Google finally goes public with the Google Glass, they will mess it up with design etc and Apple will &#8216;improvise&#8217; the idea (fancy term for copy) and release a product. They will probably call it iEye</p>
<p>eyePhone</p>
<p><img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111120021359/en.futurama/images/6/61/Futurama-eyephone_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty much a given that Apple is probably already working on something like this, and were doing so before Google announced their project. Nokia had ideas almost exactly like this 5 or 6 years ago. Google&#8217;s not breaking new ground in their ideas here, they may just be first to market with one. Several other companies are already working on these types of devices (pretty sure Motorola was reportedly working on a similar device recently as well).</p>
<p>I do wonder how quickly consumers will take to these. This could be huge for both Google and the tech world.</p>
<p>The promotion video on youtube already has 10&#8217;s of millions of views, it&#8217;s even been featured on my local newspaper. It&#8217;s undeniable that this Google glasses will be HUGE once it&#8217;s readily available for consumers.</p>
<p>The real question is, will it be a successful and handy product as Google says it is?</p>
<p>Ah, you&#8217;re absolutely correct. People will buy it. And I do agree with you. I hope it works well and maybe with some improvements when it releases. I would love for this technology to be useful in the near future.</p>
<p>it could be dangerous for most people.  so many people can barely walk and chew gum at the same time, imagine an overlay in their field of vision.</p>
<p>*In the extreme top right of their field of vision</p>
<p>My bet is slowly if we&#8217;re talking about the mainstream. It&#8217;s one thing to be interested enough to watch a video about them, it&#8217;s a very different thing to actually buy them and wear them out in public.  I think the sheer geek factor is going to put a lot of people off.</p>
<p>What they really need is a &#8220;killer app&#8221;, something that has widespread appeal that can&#8217;t be done any other way. So far I haven&#8217;t seen that in Google&#8217;s demos. Messaging, navigation and occasional AR can all be done well enough on smartphones that I doubt many people are going to want the glasses.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a camera! That you wear on your head! A camera!</p>
<p>So far, apart from a video that was so far into pure fantasy that it doesn&#8217;t even qualify as marketing, they haven&#8217;t even demonstrated messaging and navigation. Given that navigation simply sucks on a large percentage of Android phones (where is presumably much easier to get it right), I&#8217;m still in the &#8220;wait and see&#8221; camp.</p>
<p>I think this will take much, much longer to reach market than most people are assuming.</p>
<p>How does navigation suck on a large percentage of Android phones? They all use Google Maps. They all operate the same</p>
<p>Navigation on Android phones is fantastic. Google Navigation and Google Maps are probably the best in class.</p>
<p>And they haven&#8217;t shown off messaging and navigation yet because they&#8217;re not finished.</p>
<p>What navigation have you been using?</p>
<p>Remember those weird blue tooth ear pieces? they&#8217;re not so weird anymore.</p>
<p>Got to disagree, I see very few people actually walking around wearing bluetooth headsets. Plenty of people use them in cars where they serve a purpose but I think most of the mainstream still think it&#8217;s a bit weird to wear them in other places.</p>

<p>They should coin it Google Vision instead of Google Glass.</p>
<p>Before we know it they&#8217;ll be offering Google Surgery for occular nanomachines to be placed under our lenses; they&#8217;ll call it hands-free Google Glass with a seamless UI and a battery that never needs to be recharged.</p>
<p>Glasses, then contact lenses, then nanomachines.</p>
<p>wonder how would you upgrade it :)</p>
<p>Just like many current Android devices, it just wouldn&#8217;t ever get upgraded. You&#8217;d need to buy a new one.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m going to be there at Google IO this year for <a href="http://www.the4cast.com/">The 4Cast</a>. And we;ve been informed by one of the dev that there is going to be a special stall to showcase Project Glass. The Verge could test them out probably!</p>
<p>Technology that gets out of your way and into everyone else&#8217;s way.  I&#8217;d be really put off if I was talking to someone while they were wearing Google Glasses.</p>
<p>your problem, not mine</p>
<p>Good point, if it&#8217;s social unacceptable to keep pulling out your phone to check your messages how is getting them delivered to your glasses any different.</p>
<p>I keep seeing people saying this. But if its like the HUD in a fighter jet you HAVE to look at the world naturally to even see the stuff being displayed. If you try to focus on it you won&#8217;t see it. I&#8217;m assuming this might be one reason its for folks with good vision besides working on how it will fit on glasses.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t talking about now the technology works, I was talking about constantly getting messages coming in distracts people from the conversation they&#8217;re actually having in real life. When I&#8217;m talking with someone I want their attention to be focused on me and not split between our conversation and whatever messages they&#8217;ve got coming in via email, Facebook, Twitter or whatever. With phones the problem is rather self-limiting because it&#8217;s blatantly obvious but with Google Glasses people would just appear constantly distracted.</p>
<p>Easy solution.  Configurable setting to queue updates with indicator when speech is in progress and/or someone within proximity sensor range.  Google empowers your brain.</p>
<blockquote>I’d be really put off if I was talking to someone while they were wearing Google Glasses.</blockquote>
<p>This is a selling point.</p>
<p>Are you put off when you talk to someone wearing sunglasses?</p>
<p>To an extent yes; if I&#8217;m going to have a real, in-depth conversation with someone seeing their eyes is essential.</p>
<p>Photochromic lens have been around for a while.  Google empowers your brain.</p>
<p>Get a life.</p>
<p>I need to get a life because I don&#8217;t want a wall of tinted glass between me and the person I&#8217;m talking to? That&#8217;s ridiculous!</p>
<p>Just look at their left eye. Not a big deal.</p>
<p>Look at her boobs, and if it&#8217;s a guy, look around for boobs.</p>
<p>Also a good idea.</p>
<p>How would these work if someone was short sighted? Would they have to squint to see what the glasses display?</p>
<p>It depends how short sighted. The technology in a HUD like this creates a virtual image which appears further away than it really is. That big block of glass/perspex allows this.<br />
Not sure what the specs are on these specifically but I think half a meter or more.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s a HUD, so if you are not wearing glasses/contacts, you dont see anything. if you are, you see everything, the image as well</p>
<p>How about anything other then taking mid quality photos and videos? How about show something interesting?</p>
<p>There are massive privacy issues with this. With a regular or phone camera, it is fairly obvious you are being recorded if the device lens is being pointed in your general direction. But with glasses, there will need to be a way for people to differentiate between being looked at (as per a regular pair of glasses) or being recorded. Obviously, a pulsating red LED will be the solution &#8211; as per most professional camcorders.</p>
<p>at which point, many people will just tape a piece of black electrical tape over the  LED, lol.</p>
<p>Everyone already carries a camera on them at all times — what privacy is this encroaching upon that a cell phone doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>A cell phone: person is holding it up and pointing at you when recording.</p>
<p>Glasses: someone wearing them can be recording you without it being obvious.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m holding up a phone typing this right now. The people in front of me have no idea if I&#8217;m recording them or not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d think most people would notice the difference between someone just holding a phone and actively pointing it at someone or something. If the camera is built into glasses there would be no way to tell the difference.</p>
<p>Why should anybody care.</p>
<p>Because some people still like to be in control of their lives and how images of them are being used&#8230;It&#8217;s amazing that so many people have stopped caring about that.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in public I really don&#8217;t see that there&#8217;s an issue. If you&#8217;re in a private place you can always be asked to remove the glasses or leave.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I find the thought of a society where everyone weares these glasses and can record what they see at any time a very scary one.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave this here for you &#8211; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prfRH01iG1U" target="new"></a></p>

<p>How is that any more scary than a world where most people have at least one camera in their pocket at any given moment?</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>A camera being held up and pointed is an obvious thing.</p>
<p>Glasses aren&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t do backflips on a trampoline in my regular glasses, let alone my $500 Google glasses.</p>

I&#8217;m hoping Viewfinder et al don&#8217;t sue for patent infringement [sarcasm]</p>
<p>this is cool until they find out it causes brain tumors.</p>
<p>Great tech for exams!</p>
<p>a whole new era of homemade porn movies will arise from this</p>
<p>POV PR0N</p>
<p>I was just about to say this. The porn industry must be getting, for lack of a better term, excited.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a video from a camera on a trampoline. Lame. Was expecting some Glass interface action at least.</p>
<p>Is jumping with glasses on safe?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve jumped out of a plane with glasses on, so I&#8217;m going to go ahead and say yes.</p>
<p>ok, it record videos. Wake me up when a video conference is made and a when you can see crystal clear UI elements on it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very cool technology but I don&#8217;t know if people will really just start using that on street, there are a lot of things that I take my glasses off because it&#8217;s not really practical, despite that, isn&#8217;t the scree/camera part a bit annoying and on your vision way?</p>
<p>So I suggest that they send one for me so I can test it out, make a review and based on that make a market evaluation.</p>
<p>Now take a moment, if you will, to think about the benefits the porn filmers will gain from this.</p>
<p>imagine the benefits of having an ugly partner and having him/her HUD overlayed with a more attractive person.</p>
<p>a new sexual revolution</p>
<p>This project glass video recording is making me think of the movie Strange Days. Anyone else?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s so ground breaking about that video. We already have helmet cams for this type of stuff, and this one has terrible quality, if that footage is straight from the glasses. I suppose size is the only real cool thing I see here.</p>
<p>My wife will be so embarrassed for me, but I don&#8217;t care I want this.</p>
<p>PLEASE Google don&#8217;t mess this up. So excited.</p>
<p>The video seems low Rez so would that degrade its ability to identify and provide thorough and useful information?</p>
<p>I smell something nasty. Did Go Pro just shit their pants?</p>

<p>my geek meter just exploded</p>
<p>That video is such total rubbish.  It would work in glasses where there is at least some space for a power source and processor but not in contact lens.  Absolute rubbish!!!  Maybe in 50+ years.</p>
<p>Or maybe we&#8217;re already there and that&#8217;s what they are doing&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe if we had far better low light cameras we would notice UFOs had a Google logo on them.</p>
<p>hahaha enjoying this comment!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually  reality I imagine.</p>
<p>Yeah! They should just give up trying and come back then, the losers.</p>
<p>You sound like an expert, do tell more.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s technology can run on almost no power. It could easily draw power from it&#8217;s host &#8211; your hot energy emitting body! Have faith, Google have some VERY smart people working for them. Who would have predicted that TODAY we would have cars that can drive themselves without a single accident? Google made it so.</p>
<p>Absolute rubbish?  <strong>1st</strong>, let me point you towards a gentleman by the name of Ben Krasnow.  He, working by himself in his home workshop to create and test on himself a crude contact lens with a single LED built in powered via conductive coil.  So a company with the resources of Google and the professional research being done to integrate a number of things into contacts makes a contact able to display info very plausible.</p>
<p><strong>2nd</strong>, who said the contact lens has to have all the processing power, radios, gizmo&#8217;s built in?  Do you have a smartphone in your pocket that does all that?  Yes. Can you possibly put a display and a simple radio on a lens?  Yes.  Combine the two.  Smartphone does heavy lifting, lens is a simple input/output tool.</p>
<p><strong>3rd</strong>, power source.  It is technically feasible to power (special built) LCD TV&#8217;s from up to 30 feet away.  No reason a similar technology cannot be used for the infinitely tiny power requirements of a tiny display, processor and radio.</p>
<p>I forgot to put in a link to Ben&#8217;s video here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHECpEhJdB8" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHECpEhJdB8</a></p>
<p>Even the guy in your video says that there are technical challenges that would prevent smart contacts &#8220;any time soon&#8221;. And he is only talking about optical challenges, not all the other obvious ones like the fact that we don&#8217;t have the technology to miniaturize a whole display to the size of your pupil, nor to miniaturize a screen microcontroller and a radio (contrary to what you said) to fit between your eye and your eyelid. And I don&#8217;t know about how it is possible to remotely power a TV (I&#8217;d love to see a link if you have one) so I can&#8217;t really comment on that, but just to state the obvious, in Krasnow&#8217;s demo he powers the LED with a coil that he has to put in front of his eye, so this solution isn&#8217;t any better than smart glasses.</p>
<p>Like everyone else I&#8217;d love to have smart contact lenses, and I&#8217;m not saying it won&#8217;t ever be done, but realistically we&#8217;re closer to have flying cars and a hotel on the moon than what&#8217;s described in the article&#8217;s video.</p>
<p>Absolutely.  This is exactly my point.  It&#8217;s like Google releasing a video about time-travel or teleportation  with lots of flashy graphics and going on like this is something we&#8217;ll be seeing soon (and by soon I mean the next 10 years).  It doesn&#8217;t change the fact that humanity has been trying to figure this stuff out for centuries and are absolutely no closer then when they started.  Sure, our tools and knowledge are getting more and more advanced but wireless energy is like teleportation or zero-point energy.  We are not there yet and won&#8217;t be for a while.</p>
<p>For centuries????</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;ll see it in my lifetime but I&#8217;m doubtful.  Hey, I want AR Lenses as much as the next man but I&#8217;m a realist.</p>
<p>My point was rather that you are suggesting people have been working on wearable screens for centuries.  15 years ago were people trying to strap CRTS to their heads?</p>
<p>you fell for his trolling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trolling.  I&#8217;m being serious.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the construction that I find implausible at our current level of nanotechnology.  The screen is not the problem.  It&#8217;s not even the receivers the contact lens would need (mainly data from an external device ).  It&#8217;s the invention of long range wireless energy (and by long range I mean around a meter, not directly in front of the device).  Did I miss the memo or is this now possible?</p>
<p>I look forward to your lengthy essay on this subject</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/17842366.jpg" /></p>
<p>glad someone else made one. I was too lazy to do it</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point, you wouldn&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t testing contact lenses, just the glasses. Read the article.</p>
<p>Google eyePhone?</p>
<p>Seriously though, this would be amazing. Not too sure about literally talking myself to use this but it&#8217;d be incredible. this plus a Face.com type thing is the future imo.</p>
<p>Also Google Maps around specific buildings? Get on that Google.</p>
<p>googley eyes.</p>
<p>or they can repurpose the name, google goggles</p>
<p>burning retinas</p>
<p>google maps around buildings &#8211; It&#8217;s been available since Google Maps v6 on Android &#8211; just not many locations actually have the data yet.</p>
<p>They started Indoor Maps a month or two ago. It&#8217;s supposed to be available for Ikea, and some airports. I haven&#8217;t been anywhere that has it yet.</p>
<p>ah right, cool. Hopefully it takes off</p>

<p>Ads on your retina</p>
<p>Like the scene in Minority Report, except without the holograms.</p>
<p>No need of holograms, if you have stereograms on your eyes.</p>
<p>this should be able to allow 3d images by having a slightly different image in each contact. That would be really cool. your could essentially be looking at a hologram.</p>
<p>Yes, in your own retina display&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple lawsuit, coming right up.</p>
<p>Oh man but what if someone hacks your eyes.</p>
<p>I can picture it now. Your driving down the express way going 70 mph and then you come up to a curve and bam, rick rolled. Then you crash, burn, and die. The contacts will also show you &#8220;the light&#8221; right before you slip away.</p>

<p>Obviously, someone in Google took that &#8220;My vision is augmented&#8221; joke a little too far. On the upside, to use theese there&#8217;s no need to poke your eyeballs out &#8211; for a start.</p>
<p>I think my favorite Science Fiction example of this is the book Rainbow&#8217;s End by Vernor Vinge:<br />
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End</a><br />
  The computer systems were essentially part of your clothing and the interface was gesture based.  Users had contact lenses as well.  Pretty darn cool book.</p>
<p>Thanks for the recommendation.</p>
<p>Love this novel.  Actually, finished rereading it last night.</p>
<p>I am just so happy these things don&#8217;t look like the Oakly Thumps that the initial rumors were pointing towards.  These look sleek, futuristic and almost forgettable in terms of not standing out.  I would have drawn the line at having to look like The Bounty Hunter to enjoy a VR display.</p>
<p>I want!</p>
<p>The next step would be a simple &#8216;cataract surgery&#8217; to replace your crystalline lens with a new permanent stereo display. After this, you could live ina fantasy world were anything could happen, or look like it were happening. Pretty crazy.</p>
<p>Torchwood.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible with contacts. Your eye wouldn&#8217;t be able to focus up that close&#8230;.</p>
<p>Ummm&#8230;it&#8217;s right at the focal point.</p>

<p>Introducing the Holoband</p>
<p>Well I think this &#8220;share vision&#8221; thing is really annoying if you use contact lenses (blinking). But I really hope this will be available in the not so distant future.</p>
<p>120Hz and 240Hz TVs already splice in &#8220;missing&#8221; frames. I&#8217;m sure they could come up with an algorithm to filter out blinks.</p>
<p>This is really, really cool. I&#8217;d wear those glasses if they looked a little less weird and if I knew I could do that.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t. Get. This. Ads. Out. Of. My. EYES! <strong>gouges eyes out</strong></p>
<p>That would suck.</p>
<p>That may or may not be better than a never ending loop of lolcatz memes.</p>
<p>A theoretical product can be used in any theoretical product.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the tech in the book Daemon.</p>
<p>Guys, it looks nice, but remember, its a google product, it will be beta FOREVER.</p>
<p>Meaningless.  Gmail was Beta for years and it was fantastic.</p>
<p>Would I wear these? In a heartbeat.</p>
<p>more importantly, can I afford these?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re mistaking Google for Apple.</p>
<p>Stop&#8230; hating is bad.</p>
<p><img src="http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Haters_Gonna_Hate.gif" width="300" /></p>
<p>your right, the adds being overlaid everything I see will pay for it.</p>
<p>Remember when all the Apple fanboys said that about Android, saying the phone would display ads or that it&#8217;d be constantly buzzing or receiving messages with discounts when you&#8217;re out shopping</p>
<p>You know wht, it never happened, it&#8217;s just a good phone OS, like these will be an alternative UI for a secondary phone display</p>
<p>Ads won&#8217;t creep in because people won&#8217;t buy them but on the remotest possibility they do&#8230; ad-block+ will solve it anyway.</p>
<p>Yea, I guess your right. That was a rash reply. Google and Apple just do things differently. I use services from both.</p>
<p>The thing is my limit experience with a tmoble android phone has been terrible, and thats an &#8220;affordable&#8221; android phone. There are good android phones but they are about as expensive as iphones are.</p>
<p>So I don&#8217;t see the basis to say that this product will be cheaper compared to something apple makes. In my view, if it is, it must be because it&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p>The old mantra of &#8220;You get what you pay for&#8221; comes to mind. ;-)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned 2 of the best Android phones (in their respective eras) and they weren&#8217;t expensive. I just waited for Amazon to put it on sale.</p>
<p>The Droid 1 I got for $75 on renewal (waited too long and missed the $50 renewal price) and the Rezound for $150 on a renewal. The Rezound is now $50 (I think for new).</p>
<p>whoops, sorry. I think I replied to the wrong person. I meant to reply @4278&#8217;s comment. I can&#8217;t figure out how to edit or delete comments.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>ah, ok. Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Oh great, so you&#8217;re saying I&#8217;m going to have to root my f&#8217;ing eyeglasses now just to get the latest OS update?</p>
<p>More like, if you on this site, your likely to root it for S&#8217;s and G&#8217;s if nothing else. :)</p>
<p>Well, you don&#8217;t have to <em>root</em> them. Just wait for AT&amp;T, Sprint or Verizon to release the update. They promised it&#8217;ll be out by next year !</p>
<p>Just sayin&#8217;, in my memory, no carrier has ever &#8220;promised&#8221; an update to any phone ever.</p>
<p>You must be losing your memory, because carriers promise updates quite a lot.</p>
<p>Indeed, they NEVER promise updates. <a href="http://vrge.co/HU6WF8" target="_blank">http://vrge.co/HU6WF8</a></p>
<p>You do know how to distinguish between carriers and manufacturers, right?</p>
<p>You realize that ALOT of phones are exclusive to carriers, and they promise updates all the time, Evo 4G, T-Bolt, D-Charge, Vivid, these are all exclusive, and you&#8217;re crazy if you don&#8217;t think carriers don&#8217;t make statements about updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not denying carriers promise updates (sucks for you in the US).<br />
I&#8217;m just saying you linked to a post mentioning a manufacturer promising updates trying to make a point that carriers promise updates.</p>
<p>There are just a display that connects to another device.</p>
<p>Yes, unless you want LookWiz Outdated Edition on it.</p>
<p>I know ! Right ? Didn&#8217;t he see the iPad&#8217;s price compared to the competition ?!</p>
<p>Yes, in Google world, you don&#8217;t pay for a product up front, you simply pay for it in a shit user experience full of ads. See? We can all be ignorant!</p>
<p>hmm not quite sure how it will look, my eyes can&#8217;t focus on anything that near my eye</p>
<p>It is not a display, it is projector, it projects image directly to your retina.</p>
<p>That or it uses lenses to form a virtual image way out where you can easily focus. It doesn&#8217;t have to project onto the retina, you can just change where the image appears.</p>
<p>Ah so there&#8217;s quite a lot going onto it, hmm can&#8217;t wait to try it out</p>
<p>Yep. Just like all the electronical viewfinders on mirrorless cameras. You just focus (your eyes) to infinity.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t see any lenses in the photo..</p>
<p>What do you think that big ass clear thing in front of his eye is?</p>
<p>So what you&#8217;re saying is that.. it&#8217;s some sort of.. retina display?</p>

<p>Okay, so they&#8217;re actually kinda sexy on a bearded man. May have to give em a second chance after all</p>
<p>Most things are.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t seem to be wearing any contacts&#8230;</p>
<p>The frame looks to have significant wear on it. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s an aesthetic or just a product of use.</p>
<p>looks like it&#8217;s a color effect, cause the electronic part doesn&#8217;t have it. likely they would replace the frame if that was wear.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s a reflection. The frame is metallic.</p>
<p>Tortoise shell frames.</p>
<p>Think the design will subtly change before release anyway, but wonder if Google could partner designer glasses companies &amp; even have a full range</p>
<p>I see this as highly likely,  there are quite a few &#8220;luxury&#8221; brand 3d glasses out there.  This should be no different.</p>
<p>This looks so incredibly awesome. Still reminds me of Cookie&#8217;s glasses from Ned&#8217;s Declassified though.</p>
<p>Bet they could build that into thick frame hipster glasses.</p>
<p>That would be Tim Cook&#8217;s solution&#8230;</p>
<p><em>sigh</em></p>
<p>I wish we had an unRecommend button. This juvenile sniping is getting out of hand.</p>
<p>hit it twice, it undos your recommend.</p>
<p>I think he means more like a down-vote button.</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>Need them in white.</p>
<p>I just want these to be out like yesterday! I hope they&#8217;re out within a year.</p>
<p>looks a bit high to me &#8211; i suppose it has to stay out of your way but it also looks like you have to look up (a lot) to use it.</p>
<p>Nah i think it&#8217;s in line with your eye, but i think it looks like it cuts off halfway so you can read without it getting in the way.</p>
<p>I think it could be that way because it is not a screen but a retinal imaging display. There are already prototypes of that tech that look like Google Glass and it would fit the use-case perfectly.<br />
I could be totally wrong of course.</p>
<p>I wonder if the actual processing is occurring elsewhere, like on a phone?  I&#8217;d imagine this is just a display, radio (bluetooth?), and battery.</p>
<p>Yer I was thinking about this. Most likely tethered to his Android phone! So no iOS love unless Apple sell their own iEye Glasses range&#8230;</p>
<p>iEye, captain!</p>
<p>Best comment I&#8217;ve read in a long time.</p>
<p>iGlasses?</p>
<p>the future looks <strong>amazing</strong>! :)</p>
<p>How do you receive the audio?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as ugly as I thought it would be, however &#8220;right now you really just see it reboot&#8221; &#8211; Sergey Brin</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t see anyone outside of hardcore nerds wearing these.  I could be wrong, but I just don&#8217;t see it happening.  Perhaps if it fit into normal glasses, then maybe.</p>
<p>Nobody was ready to use a Walkman before it was launched. Transporting music with me ? Having headphones on my ears ? This is nuts !</p>
<p>I could have predicted the widespread adoption of the atomic powered car with your rhetoric/logic.</p>
<p>No.<br />
I did not state that any new idea will grow into a widespread technology, just that you can not predict if something will become fashionable or not based on your initial sentiment about it.</p>
<p>Fair enough, that&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>I tip my hat to you, sir, for your probity.<br />
It is weird to do not have to deal with the troll brigade.</p>
<p>An iPod? Taking my whole music collection with me, madness.</p>
<p>But you don&#8217;t wear an iPod on your face.</p>
<p>But you wear earbuds/headphones on your head.</p>
<p>Which mainstream consumers had been doing for 20 years.</p>
<p>And nobody did before then.</p>
<p>And you know what, that honestly still looks goofy. But we do it anyway for the benefits.</p>
<p>How about those bluetooth headsets that you plug into one ear.</p>
<p>Actually, for more than 40 years&#8230; FM radio came out in the early 60s and headphones weren&#8217;t far behind.</p>
<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Gbj0mpn5XyA/TSbTR6OMdjI/AAAAAAAAEBQ/5w3HAqhPAdg/s400/KOSS.headphone.ad.1970s.jpg" /></p>
<p>Even longer if you consider earmuffs which, design and application wise are similar (at least in terms of the &#8216;goofy stuff people put on their heads&#8217;) earmuffs have been around for almost 150 years.</p>
<p>If they could integrate it with a gaming console, I&#8217;d definitely wear it while I&#8217;m playing my 360. Out in public? Ehhhhhhh&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see an actual prototype. I wonder how well they&#8217;re working as of today.</p>
<p>And not as ugly as one would think. With a few design changes, they could be quite attractive.</p>
<p>That looks ugly, I wish it was more like traditional glasses with a sleek frame.</p>
<p>They can do that too&#8230;</p>
<p>This seems really awesome, but it will be weird when my glasses force close for the first time.</p>
<p>Watch the movie Hardwired. That&#8217;s where this is going.</p>
<p>I hope they make a version that can take prescription lenses. Either that, or I&#8217;d gladly fork out for Lasik just to wear them!</p>
<p>They already said that it can be worn with glasses on.  Contacts are also an option.  I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons they are going with a thin frame that sits high.</p>
<p>My wife just did the Lasik thing.  She still pokes herself in the forehead every now and then.  Habits die hard&#8230;.  Her far vision is still kinda blurry, but the doc said she might need a second touch up surgery.</p>
<p>Might have to make some fake ones and pretend I have some! <br />
How long people you can buy these as just standard glasses&#8230;</p>
<p>First people were saying that Google probably don&#8217;t teen have  prototypes built and the technology was impossible, it was a vaporware. I wonder they will say now. &#8220;it will never ship&#8221; or &quot; thats probably just plastic&quot; or &#8220;no one will where these&#8221;. I think they are scared of awesome these will be.</p>
<p>&#8220;right now you really just see it reboot&#8221; &#8211; Sergey Brin</p>

<p>&#8220;People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.&#8221;<br />
-Alan Kay</p>
<p>So perhaps Google is finally being serious about Project Glass software, unlike Android.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never used a Nexus.</p>
<p>Which one?  There are many by many manufacturers.  Some kind of suck, some can&#8217;t be upgraded to 4.0, some haven&#8217;t been upgraded to 4.0.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t make or design that hardware anyhow, Samsung or HTC  did.</p>
<p>Assuming we accept the premise that anyone who has only made software, isn&#8217;t serious about it, which I for one am not accepting.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter the point is people were saying only thing Google has done with the glasses is the video. These pictures disproves that.</p>
<p>I could make a mockup that does nothing.  This picture doesn&#8217;t disprove anything.  Even Sergey said it didn&#8217;t do anything.</p>
<p>What this proves is&#8230;there is a pair of glasses.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t prove a thing about what they do or don&#8217;t do.</p>
<p>He said it reboots and projects an image of rebooting.  That&#8217;s more than my glasses do right now&#8230;</p>
<p>If I wanted to watch something reboot I&#8217;d stare at my Windows laptop.  I prefer my regular glasses that don&#8217;t need to reboot to work.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a problem at all with the &#8220;glasses&#8221; part of it. What kills the crab is the voice interface. Give me eye-tracking, a brain implant or at least a sub-vocalizing jaw mike or something. I don&#8217;t want to be talking to my glasses, for fuck&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s okay, they don&#8217;t want to talk to you either.</p>
<p>This sounds oddly like when people first reacted to controlling phones with voice commands. Or cars. Etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of the lopsided design. Glasses themselves can be annoying to wear with the extra weight on my ears. Having the bulk of the gadget falling on one ear would be even worse. Hopefully they can keep the weight really low to prevent discomfort with extended wear. I&#8217;m excited to see where this technology goes. I&#8217;m crossing my fingers in hopes that it&#8217;s not another Google flop.</p>
<p>Really good point.  I wear glasses when I read or sit at a computer all day and even that can get pretty uncomfortable by the end of the day.  I can&#8217;t imagine a lopsided, relatively heavy set of glasses.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not using them, get silicon pads. The difference is amazing, and you can barely notice them (If you&#8217;ve got light frames).</p>
<p>They can also do a symmetrical model. And since it&#8217;s a dumb terminal it should be fairly light.</p>
<p>Hardware on the left, batteries on the right, and hopefully everything is a LOT smaller&#8230;</p>
<p>this will only work if they come storming out of the gate. if not, people will be verryyyy slow to adapt.</p>
<p>Pretty cool, the first thing i thought when i saw this was that we are one step closer to this:<img src="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/056/over9000.jpg" /></p>
<p>Dead</p>
<p>This is so cool, its Ironman level stuff.</p>
<p>Imagine what its going to be like when the first actual customers get these, yes, there will be the sarcastic remarks like those made about bluetooth headsets&#8230;.but at the same time, you&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re looking at a one percenter :-)</p>
<p>Hat Computer!</p>
<p>Recommended because of &#8220;Hat Computer!&#8221;</p>
<p>most interesting, Google is developing the next&#8230;.&#8220;ipod&#8221;-like device, that will catch the average consumer&#8217;s wallet!  what happened Apple? time to mix more koolaid&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>How about having to clean the lens and how fragile are the frames? Also how exactly would we control the level of interference that these will generate, for instance setting different priority settings that filter how many notifications that we receive. I definitely don&#8217;t see this as an autonomous gadget. It will need to connect and sync up and adjusted via a smartphone.</p>
<p>This is why people hire professional models, look how happy the girl is and how miserable the bearded guy looks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna guess that &#8220;bearded guy&#8221; is pretty happy, too. Billions of dollars may not buy happiness, but it gives you plenty of time to look for it.</p>
<p>billions of $$$ = jet skis, private jets, parties, ability to do virtually anything you wanted.</p>
<p>A comedian once said &#8220;Have you ever seen someone on a jet ski look unhappy? No!&#8221;</p>
<p>Want!</p>
<p>I hope to see this technology available to the average user very soon. If the software stack (and developer support) behind the technology is the &#8220;right&#8221; one, this can be huge.</p>
<p>while cool I have two thoughts&#8230;</p>

<p>this isn&#8217;t AR! this is a small screen on a piece of glass. screen is not even transparent to be considered AR</p>
<p>Umadbro?</p>
<p>It looks like if somebody were to bitchslap the Google Glass wearer, they would lose an eye by way of that piece of glass getting jammed into the eye socket. Seeing how one looks wearing one, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a real possibility.</p>
<p>Ahem <strong>glasses</strong></p>
<p>i see these are more of an extension of the phone&#8217;s screen.<br />
having important information pop up as opposed to a replacement.</p>
<p>where this really excites me is to see what other people can do with the hardware. <br />
A bit like kinect, i&#8217;m not overly fussed that i can drive a racing car with my hands or pet a tiger, but instead look at some of the hacks that people make for it.</p>
<p>Since when is Sergey Brin a real human? I thought he was a robot sent from the future to eliminate Yahoo and bring us search technology.</p>
<p>If anyone likes anime, they should check out Dennō Coil  &#8211;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennō_Coil" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennō_Coil</a></p>
<p>It has some interesting ideas on how the world would be with these glasses as the cultural norm. It follows a group of children so it might feel young. Still, there are some interesting concepts. I haven&#8217;t watched it in a while but I remember it being good.</p>
<p>you, sir, have been highly recommended</p>
<p>Why only right eye can see that &#8220;screen&#8221;?<br />
Or did I misunderstood something?</p>
<p>You only need one eye to see it, just ask any AH-64 pilot.  Hopefully it has the ability to swap left or right.  Otherwise people that are left eye dominant will have focusing problems.</p>
<p>The real question is can it display my health level, ammo count, and HEV suit power level.</p>
<p>This combined with kinect ;)</p>
<p>Actually, that looks pretty cool to use now. I might go down to the stores to get one of these one day, but i would prefer the white version to the on Brin was using.</p>
<p>The only other thing that would bother me is the fact that putting an OS on Google Glasses mkaes me worried that Google won&#8217;t be able to efficiently update these products in time, unless Google would be the only company to male these (unlike android phones/ tablets) then that worry would go away more easily.</p>
<p>It looks like it will reflect light off the piece of glass into your eye.</p>
<p>That is so tight, I actually designed a 3D lower power RGB laser occular projection display in 2000: but the cost to produce it back then were so astronomical because the blue-diode component was considered exotic as were the mems controllers and other components&#8230;. likewise without something like android/ and a fast 3G or better mobile internet connection, it was just a display. I agree with Paul Miller, I have been dreaming of something like this since the mid 1980&#8217;s&#8230;.</p>
<p>So these would not work for anyone that wears real glasses, or sunglasses outside? If not only the geekiest of all nerdome will ever touch these. I love my technology but seriously&#8230; No soccer mom or normal smart phone user will ever wear these. Hell, I don&#8217;t think I would wear these, and as anyone posting here on a tech blog we are the minority of users that would be the target market.</p>
<p>Cool concept, not so much on the design. Hopefully this is early concept stage and the real deal is a much sleeker design.</p>
<p>My company bought a, not significantly larger, version of this display, connected to a belt-mount IBM-PC compatible computer, back in the early 80s. The display was red because it was created from an LED array. It was manufactured by a little company in New York state that I can&#8217;t remember the name of. They initially created the device for the military and for all I know may have been successful and are well known today. We envisioned using it to overlay technical manual style information while working on mechanical hardware in the field. Nothing came of our project as the supplier was unable to solve some reliability problems with the PC hardware. As I recall, the display worked pretty well if you plugged it into a desktop PC.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, this kind of display is not new and the only thing that has happened with it in the last 25-30 years is it has gotten smaller/lighter/etc. as manufacturing technology has improved. The real key to its success will be the software that drives it. From the Google demonstration video, it looks like it wouldn&#8217;t be much of a stretch for an iOS/Android device to mimic this product today.</p>
<p>The only question is: would a common person be likely to want one? I think the answer to that question is: no. The common person will only adopt something like this when it is surgically implanted in their brain. In the meantime, geeks, myself included, will likely want to have one.</p>
<p>I really hope this actually pans out because I would absolutely love to wear something like this even though everyone else around me would think I&#8217;m a huge dork (even if these are supposed to be &#8220;fashionable&#8221;.)</p>

<p>i was right wasn&#8217;t i? those silly turds.. thanks for the back up!</p>
<p>I understand if you aren&#8217;t excited about augmented reality, I am sure you have your reasons. But you must really hate Google a LOT to assume that nobody else could ever be excited about this.</p>
<p>Dorky geeks care about wearing goofy glasses and bracelets.</p>
<p>Call me when it&#8217;s practical.</p>
<p>yes you look like a really cool guy</p>
<p>You&#8217;re reading and commenting on a tech blog&#8230;<br />
Apple products do not your geekness eliminate.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a geek, not a dork.  There&#8217;s a difference.</p>
<p>And the coolest one ever a that.</p>
<p>You almost got there, the word you&#8217;re looking for is douche.<br />
You&#8217;re a douche.</p>
<p>Before you argue, remember that everyone can see your post history.</p>
<p>You can have whatever opinion you want, but you don&#8217;t have to pretend that everyone whose opinion is different from yours is either wrong or joking about it.</p>
<p>no your right he really hates google specially comments like these dont help him much</p>
<p>&#8220;18 months sounds reasonable. They’ll wait for Android to mature a bit, then fork it as you said. That should save them hundreds of millions in development costs.<br />
Google is stupid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Considering Google is in the hole several billion dollars with Android, I&#8217;d say Google is pretty stupid.</p>
<p>this comment is a corporate accountancy fail</p>
<p>Haha several billion? With a &#8216;b&#8217;? Sorry bud, Android makes Google money (although it seems not a lot compared to their other services)</p>
<p>With a b.</p>

<p>I question your definition of &#8220;being in a hole several billion dollars&#8221;. <br />
You may reference the article you have provided a link to.</p>
<p>Well, in 2011 profit was estimated around $500m.  The Motorola acquisition is $12.5b.  Do the math.</p>
<p>wow your an idiot.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re</p>
<p>Care to explain why?  I am just citing Asymco, which is widely regarded as pretty accurate and insightful with this sort of data.</p>
<p>i try not to feed people like you its ok you can ponder forever what i ment by that =p</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t count an acquisition as a cost of Android.</p>
<p>my precioooouuusss&#8230;</p>
<p>ok, I&#8217;ve got it, let&#8217;s wait for the announcement of the product on 1st April 2013, nice prank google! :D</p>
<p>oh great, <img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3xjnyeqsp1qa3zrgo1_1280.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m imagining the ring from Titan AE</p>
<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/1k3F3a2W2s2K1e2q0W2b/Titan%20AE%20ring.png" /></p>
<p>Someone actually remembers my favorite movie of all time? No waaaay! :D</p>
<p>Netflix had it streaming in HD for the longest time, not any more though. :(</p>
<p>What movie was that from again? Children of Men?</p>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s BTTF II</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow I was way off  <del>_</del></p>
<p>Children of Men. Awesome movie! Some drugged up kid was playing on his 2027 Gameboy&#8230;</p>
<p>Minority Report?</p>
<p>I guess it is more discreet than a pip boy 3000.</p>
<p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR91aUB1WnMiLOGb_PzSeKUuFMP0gHmBhkK0Ml-_HzV3yiUUr2y" /></p>
<p>Definitely cooler than the Nintendo Power Glove.</p>
<p><img src="http://thecollaborationroom.org/enter/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/powerglove1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I would imagine a Kinect like interface using a front facing camera could work as well, but would be less discreet.</p>
<p>Is there any mention how the system would ignore the rings and fingernails of other users and only focus on it&#8217;s user? It would seem like an easy thing to screw with&#8230;</p>
<p>On a related note, how does Ironman control the UI elements in his internal helmet HUD?</p>
<p><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT3pOmjEemG0joHQ-oVHMxO8T0w4LhKhiDuPpSeHDAAfp3_Q9wLJw" /></p>
<p>or should they maybe pull a samsung galaxy sIII and have a camera watching your eyes?</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t, JARVIS does. He tells JARVIS what to do and it gets done. The HUD just displays information, if it were real, that is. The effect of it tracking his face would be just a camera trick to show motion for the movie. In real life, it would have to do that because the display is right over his eyes and would move with the mask, which, in turn, moves with his face/head.</p>
<p>Assuming that is true, that still does not explain the non-vocal inputs to JARVIS. There are plenty of times he&#8217;s inputting parameters for something but does not actually say anything. For example in the first movie, he is able to selectively zoom in on the boy in the ferris wheel or more importantly in the scene where he first encounters hostiles taking hostages, he is able to silently power down his repulsors in his palms and from the UI is able to designate civilians and hostiles. How this is done is not really explained but in practical terms is the challenge and focus of this patent and project glass.</p>
<p>If you used the colantotte app for iphone, you would&#8217;ve known that it&#8217;s a feature that Tony built into Jarvis(which is an AI, told by countless Iron Man cartoons, comics and if I remember correctly, then the movie too) :)</p>

<p>I hate when verge does this&#8230;</p>
<p>alpha/beta/theta &#8211; brain waves! (and that&#8217;s AFTER retina tracking).</p>
<p>In The Avengers, the suit clearly tracks multiple points in his retina, which enables very accurate eye-tracking. It&#8217;s what he uses for tagging items in the real world, as well as pointing to UI elements in his HUD.</p>
<p>The only thing that&#8217;s not obvious is how he &#8220;clicks&#8221; or selects an item in the UI.  He might use a finger tap, or a minor chin movement (like the <a href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/MJOLNIR_Powered_Assault_Armor">Mark-V Mjolnir armor</a> from the Halo books).</p>
<p>Kinect.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess it&#8217;s not really related, but:<br />
<a href="http://www.gifflix.com/files/6b9aab82a87d.jpg"></a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.gifflix.com/files/6b9aab82a87d.jpg" /></p>
<p>So they send out a press release and tell the world about their cool new gadget and they don&#8217;t even know how the user is going to control it?!</p>
<p>And any device that requires you to wear 3 separate items to work it will fail a miserable and deserved death. Seriously, an artificial fingernail?! The glasses themselves were already dangerously into &#8220;geeky douche&#8221; territory.</p>
<p>The existence of this patent from September shows that they definitely have ideas on how the user is going to control it</p>
<p>&#8230;and your suggestion is?  The artificial fingernail is a genius idea&#8230;.they can be totally discreet (read: non painted) and I can program gestures to do when i flip people off, genius.</p>
<p>For some reason, the first thing I thought of was the life clock from Logan&#8217;s Run. Guess I&#8217;m old.</p>
<p>Old? I see you&#8217;ve been avoiding the glorious renewal of Carousel.</p>
<p>Fish, and plankton, sea greens and proteins from the sea. It&#8217;s my job, to freeze you.</p>
<p>Always remembered that line from the Box&#8230;</p>
<p>Because sometimes the simplest solution to a problem&#8230;is nail polish and rings.</p>
<p>&#8230;AKA solution for a solution in search of a problem.</p>
<p>One ring to track us all.</p>
<p>Step 2: Ring is NFC-enabled, allowing a Wi-Fi direct contact transfer to be initiated via handshake.</p>
<p>Google will need more control mechanisms. Kinect-style, head gestures, voice control is all good, but we need more. It needs to be able to interface with mobile phones as a control mechanism. The more control mechanisms, the less chance of accidents. Don&#8217;t want to nod and wave to someone you know, and accidentally get directions to somewhere.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll be programming in these general gestures, but yeah if they do it could be a problem.</p>
<p>Also that idea of NFC ring is a genius!!</p>
<p>It may be possible that Google&#8217;s Project X (like their self driving vehicles) is so way advanced of alternative ways of doing things that if they do launch a series of &#8216;products&#8217; almost simultaneously, they may obsolete (and cause serious financial damage t0), their immediate competitors or perceived competitors.</p>
<p>Google employ some extremely intelligent people.</p>
<p>Cart. Car.<br />
Abacus. Calculator.<br />
Prop. Jet.</p>
<p>#paradigmshift</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better than marker caps.<br />

Remember this?</p>
<p>Hell yeah, you linked to the scene with the Pink Floyd album art in the background: <img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/m5fIZ0SBgixcxaz6CtWfpgxzo1_400.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="http://rositalacosturera.blogia.com/upload/20061108140338-animals.jpg" /></p>
<p>It would be cool if you could use special fingernail polish for it. Clear for the guys and various colors for the girls.</p>
<p>Cool.. but why Google would not use some brain wave detector for the controller? Something like <a href="http://www.neurosky.com/" target="new">NeuroSky</a> has developed. I&#8217;ve been expecting something like this.</p>
<p>Cool story bro!</p>
<p>Not an <a href="http://youtu.be/CGwvZWyLiBU?t=1m19s" target="new">original idea </a>but at least they&#8217;re productising it first.</p>
<p>That actually managed to be cheesier than the Google concept vid.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s from 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Mostly because it&#8217;s a reiteration of a very, very, very old idea. But as not a really thought through concept.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really think that there was any real different functionality displayed between the nokia one and the google one. Nokia&#8217;s just was presented a bit cheesier. &#8220;fancy a picnic?&#8221;<br />
Everything in the google vid was a rehash of either that nokia video or any number of other hud concepts. It&#8217;s amazing that people are somehow thinking this is a new or original idea by google&#8230;Google isn&#8217;t showing anything groundbreaking here, they may just have the resources, and technology has finally advanced to the point, to make it a reality rather than any number of past proof of concepts.</p>
<p>the use of a bracelet as part of the interaction seems like a good idea. Maybe Nike can work with google to NikeFuel this project &#8211; runners are willing to wear ridiculous looking technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it&#8217;s going to need a lot more than just eye/head gestures to be actually useful. There&#8217;s just too much room for error there, an involuntary blink, a distracted glance, etc.</p>
<p>I can really see Google Glasses changing the way people interact. If they get the maps working and everything . One thing i could see them adding would be facial recognition (maybe limited to your circles) so it shows you who you are talking to</p>
<p>Mighty sad world if that&#8217;s what &#8220;interactions&#8221; become. Can&#8217;t we ask someone their name?</p>
<p>Why are you only focusing on that one aspect of what&#8217;s possible with these glasses? Is it me, or is the world becoming increasingly pessimistic about future technologies without even trying them.</p>
<p>He specifically addressed the scenario presented by Silver Arrow.  He did not make a broad assertion about the technology.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a troll, duh&#8230;</p>
<p>You need to step off your google worshiping soap box for a bit. There&#8217;s certainly some validity to BrancioMotor&#8217;s comment. Social networks have made us less social, our communication devices actually make us perform less actual communication. Silver Arrow&#8217;s suggestion is a further example of that detachment from actual interaction. Is it cool? Absolutely, from a tech standpoint. Is it too much of a stretch to think that this road leads somewhere down a path that looks oddly like the spaceship in Wall-E? Not in my opinion, it&#8217;s not. We probably won&#8217;t be a bunch of fat people hovering around in chairs, but the lack of social interaction is getting more and more prevalent.</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Social networks have allowed me to talk to friends all over the state, and country. People I can&#8217;t just meet up with at any given time. It allows me to be a part of that persons life even though we are hundreds or thousands of miles apart.</p>
<p>Obviously if someone if 5 or 10 miles away, I&#8217;m going to go hang out with them, not just talk with them on Facebook.</p>
<p>Phones allowed you to actually talk to people all over the world, social networks didn&#8217;t enable that. Before Facebook it just actually required you perceive value from and to put effort forth to have that interaction. Social networks allow you to be a spectator, and occasional commentator in your friends&#8217; lives. That&#8217;s not to say that they are all bad, they do aid in keeping in touch, but they are distancing you from the actual &#8216;social&#8217; interaction, and presenting you with the illusion of that interaction through words and images on a screen. Not something a lot of people seem to care about anymore though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not something a lot of people seem to care about anymore though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe it just doesn&#8217;t matter. I work with people all around the world every day, mostly by e-mail. A lot of these people don&#8217;t speak English, but they read it and write it. We crack jokes, we transact business, I know about their families &#8212; these things likely wouldn&#8217;t happen if our only resort was to pick up a phone (let alone meet face to face).</p>
<p>I find it interesting that you say this. As somebody who grew up in a military family, I am used to moving away a lot. Social networks and technology has enabled me to keep in touch with my friends that I had to physically left behind. Be it playing games online together, Google+ hang outs, or Skype calls. To me, its not about spectating and commenting on their lives, we participate and spend time together regardless of being so far apart.</p>
<p>Also, my girlfriend currently lives far away from me. Having social networks, skype, Google talk, text messaging, these things keep us together. Sometimes I&#8217;ll stream a movie through skype and we&#8217;ll watch it together, or we&#8217;ll have video calls here and there. I do not think that technology is distancing myself socially from people, but it does bring me closer to people  that I can&#8217;t physically be close to</p>
<p>Yea, but there is this nice woman that works at my Wegmans who I talk to all the time and I really should know her name, but unless you are related to me or have been a friend for like years I have no idea what your name is.  So in situations like that it would be amazing to be able to have something give me a little reminder.</p>
<p>You want to ask them what all of their recent Tweets were? Their most recent status updates? Any important dates that involve them? Those are all things that could pop up when you interact with people that help you interact better. Like it or not, the world will get much much more social than what it currently is with the aid of technology. With or without you.</p>
<p>twitter and facebook are less actual social interaction, and more the illusion of being social, with none of the actual work that goes along with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always amused at the people that champion things like twitter and fb and g+ as improvements to the social culture; they&#8217;re the opposite.</p>
<p>I disagree with your premise that the more work you put into something the more &#8220;actual&#8221; or authentic it is. I see people say the same kind of stuff to put down technology all the time and I disagree wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>My wording was poorly chosen, but I stand by my observation. Our communication devices make us actually communicate less; our social networks make us less social. When I say &#8220;actual&#8221; I mean real, personal interaction, not text on a screen, but an actual, real interaction. Perhaps it has little value to your, or little distinction between a facebook chat and an actual conversation, but I I don&#8217;t consider facebook and such as that big of an innovation for social interaction.</p>
<p>I despise Facebook and Twitter for precisely the opposite reason: way, way too much social interaction. It is nothing but social interaction. I have seen nothing useful accomplished there. My friends and families chatter endlessly about the boring minutiae of their lives. I suppose we  might argue it&#8217;s a better replacement for starting at the TV, but it&#8217;s awfully difficult to claim that there is less socialization going on.</p>
<p>By the same token, though, the availability of all forms of electronic communications greatly expands the options available to us. It is ludicrous to load the deck by declaring one type of interaction &#8220;real&#8221; and the other &#8220;illusory.&#8221; Sure, it&#8217;s probably not a good thing if your entire life is strictly &#8220;text on a screen,&#8221; but the social networks aren&#8217;t to blame &#8212; that person is a hermit, pure and simple. And those aren&#8217;t new.</p>
<p>We interact just fine though. This is just a solution without a problem. Who&#8217;s going to be buying this? Could be great for surgeons but it wont revolutionize the way we interact. Remember the Segway? Aside from handicapped people, it didn&#8217;t exactly change the world. All this doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m right and you&#8217;re wrong though, it&#8217;s just my feeling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hardly a solution without a problem.</p>
<p>View a map overlay while riding a bike. Read a text message while standing on the subway with both arms full of grocery bags or luggage or whatever. Severe weather alerts. Unobtrusive alarm clock. Caller ID that doesn&#8217;t interrupt anybody else when you&#8217;re in a meeting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s frickin&#8217; dead easy to come up with ways this can do new, useful things.</p>
<p>So nothing like MI 4, aye? that was some <em>pretty</em> crazy stuff.</p>
<p>"Facial recognition (maybe limited to your circles) so it shows you who you are talking to"</p>
<p>YES! I totally always forget the name of my best friends.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Glad to know there are still some dreamers out there.</p>
<p>Exactly, other companies are only concerned about shipping more units with the next version of their product. Google is fundamentally a different company, I hope they keep pushing forward on things like this and ignore the ignorant group of people who constantly mock their efforts.</p>
<p>This will only become a way for google to beam ads directly into your eyes all day every day.</p>
<p>And then people say stupid crap like that. Seriously, it stopped being funny a longgggg time ago. Im sure Google will control this experience and make it clean, their goal is to keep it out of the way until you need it.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re taking a board on the interweb and your love for Google way too seriously</p>
<p>Some people take their hate even more seriously. Which is more unhealthy?</p>
<p>What do you honestly expect from Google?  They are an ad based company and as such are constantly looking for ways to mine user data and increase ad delivery.  It is what they do, and they are very good at it.</p>
<p>Android doesn&#8217;t advertise at me without ad developers embedding an Admob advertisement. So, I have no idea what you&#8217;re getting at. Google doesn&#8217;t just toss random ads in your face on Android, why would that change with these glasses? No one would buy them then. Why not contribute an intelligent comment to a comment thread in the future instead of just trolling? You&#8217;re not getting anywhere and you&#8217;re just serving to spread BS.</p>
<p>If you honestly think that Google doesn&#8217;t exist to serve you ads then you are obviously a lost cause.   The Android platform wouldn&#8217;t exist at all if it wasn&#8217;t a means for Google to mine data and deliver ads.  It is what they do, and it is the primary means of profit for the company.</p>
<p>P.S.  There is no trolling intended here.  I am simply pointing out what Google does in terms of their primary business, and how they will most likely apply that to future products and services.  I am sorry if that differs from the fairytale future people seem to see here.</p>
<p>No, Google exists to make a profit. Is advertising its primary means of doing this this? Yes, but that doesnt mean they cant recognize thats ads on a device like this would seriously hurts its ability to sell.</p>
<blockquote>If you honestly think that Google doesn’t exist to serve you ads then you are obviously a lost cause.</blockquote>
<p>You are a lost cause for business education, in that case.</p>
<blockquote>The Android platform wouldn’t exist at all if it wasn’t a means for Google to mine data and deliver ads.</blockquote>
<p>Really? Is that why I only see ads on 2 apps that I use? Both being non-Google apps.</p>
<p>I actually have several years of business education under my belt.  Google makes money selling ads, and mining data that they use to target said ads as well as selling it to other advertisers and market researchers.</p>
<p>What does Google, a for profit company, gain from developing and giving away Android for free?  They gain access to you personal information.  What do they do with that information?  They use it to target ads, and sell it to other ad companies and market researchers.  How is that hard to understand?</p>
<p>They have proven time and again that they are not successful at selling products.  They make no hardware, and their pay services, those on offer to the general public, are underperforming by most standards.  It is hard to charge money for something when you have become synonymous with free.</p>
<p>In the same way that I don&#8217;t life to work but work so that I can life some company&#8217;s aren&#8217;t created to make money but make money so that they can create the dreams of the people behind it. <br />
So yes, Google is a profit company. They need money to exist. But it was created to make good products!</p>
<p>No amount of &#8220;years of business education&#8221; will ever teach you to have dreams, aspirations or imagination so I won&#8217;t be surprised if you don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>Google glasses will be a tool for mining all the data they can from your everyday offline life, and then advertise to you on their other services. I doubt they&#8217;ll beam ads to the device, it&#8217;s just going to be used to suck info out of your entire existence. Until now, Google has been somewhat limited to only being able to trace what you do online. With these, that&#8217;s not the case anymore.</p>
<p>Ads are a monetization strategy for their free products only. They are actually a data mining company and that is where they are the best.</p>
<p>The two go hand in hand.  They mine data for the purpose of targeting ads and selling said data to other advertisers and market researchers.</p>
<p>Somebody has already put up their <a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_detailpage%26v%3D_mRF0rBXIeg&feature=player_detailpage&v=_mRF0rBXIeg&gl=GB">ad infused</a> version of the concept video on YouTube.</p>
<p>There will always be custom firmware/rooting/ROMs to get around what Google wants. The important thing is the hardware.</p>
<p>Riiight&#8230; Google&#8217;s fundamentally different&#8230; and hence Android was born.  I really don&#8217;t think that makes sense.</p>
<p>Google is different, because it&#8217;s an engineering company. (Even though some people seem to think that a company is identified by the biggest income source*)</p>
<ul>
	<li>- That would make your local mortician an assassin for hire and vice versa. Since their business is death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that make your local mortician a medical waste disposal specialist?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an absurd analogy, morticians aren&#8217;t doing the killing.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re hardly &#8220;fundamentally&#8221; different with respect to this product concept. IBM, Boeing, Microsoft Research, every auto-maker, Intel&#8230; there is a long, long list of companies that are looking ahead, and sometimes throwing out concept videos or drawings or announcements in the process.</p>
<p>I bet that shut up the people calling them &#8220;just a concept&#8221; with no &#8220;real product to show for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone would say there were no prototypes but watch the video again and that all looks &#8220;made up&#8221;. I doubt google has a device that actually functions like that with that display resolution, response time, voice recognition, video camera, battery life, etc. Basically the video looks simulated and the prototypes are probably not that impressive otherwise he would show it to scobble.</p>
<p>Still, ever think that it&#8217;d be bad taste to show off prototypes to press? It probably isn&#8217;t as functional as it is in the video, rather, I was addressing the people who claimed that they had nothing at all working.</p>
<p>I guess people have become skeptical of concept videos and vapor ware. Getting a hardware product from the labs into the hands of consumers is extremely difficult especially when you are trying something that has never been done before.</p>
<p>The geek in all of us really want something like this in our hands but it just seems too good to be true.</p>
<blockquote>Still, ever think that it’d be bad taste to show off prototypes to press?</blockquote>
<p>He wore them to a somewhat high profile public event, it was purely a publicity stunt. I&#8217;m hesitant to believe that they are anywhere near the concept video. I doubt the 1.0 product will be anywhere near that.</p>
<p>Obviously the video was a simulation and no one is claiming otherwise.  It shows the potential, and what Google envisions for a final product.</p>
<p>They have not demonstrated a product. We have a concept video and a sighting of Brin wearing a prototype. When they let others try the devices, then they can say they have a product.</p>
<p>(Read my above comment)</p>
<p>They have something but how close to the concept video is it working?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but they were operational enough for Scoble to see lights flashing on the tiny display.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm.</p>
<p>with the advancements in prosthesis and AR technology, isn&#8217;t it kinda like we&#8217;re becoming machines? i know prosthesis primarily help the disable but who says you can&#8217;t get robot legs when you&#8217;re perfectly healthy. i guess what i&#8217;m trying to say is, i feel sorry for our robot overlords when we storm the cobalt castle with our tactical overlays beamed directly to our eyes, and shooting uni beams from our chest like iron man.</p>
<p>i lost myself after &#8220;we&#8217;re becoming machines&#8221; but it does seem like that. i remember the story about the turbine heart, there was no beat or pulse. and arguably those are what make us human, what next mechanical lungs? i am both eager to see and terrified of what we may become in the future</p>
<p>Actually, &#8220;death&#8221; in the strictest medical and legal sense, refers to the phenomenon of &#8220;brain death,&#8221; where the higher brain functions completely cease.  The thinking, rationalizing, creative, and <em>sentient</em> parts of the brain are the last holdouts of what defines humanity.  Even if the idea and technology of the &#8220;cyberbrain&#8221; becomes mainstream, it will be highly likely that such beings would still be considered human.  The people of 20 years ago will likely be referred to, in the future sense, as &#8220;unaugmented man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Get a grip, it&#8217;s a pair of glasses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Brin was wearing a backpack, it apparently didn&#8217;t appear that it was necessary to the functioning of the glasses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The suggestion being that inside was a battery or other communications equipment required for the glasses to operate?</p>
<p>The thinking was apparently that an eye-sized screen sucks up more energy than a forklift.</p>
<p>If Google (like Apple and Microsoft) has access to hardware that is 7-15 years ahead of what consumers are using, then it shouldn&#8217;t be difficult to believe that decent processing power and graphics could conceivably fit in a pair of thick frames (well on the sides anyway).  If the display is that small, and the processor that efficient, then the battery powering them can be inconsequentially small as well.</p>
<blockquote>If Google (like Apple and Microsoft) has access to hardware that is 7-15 years ahead of what consumers are using,</blockquote>
<p>Except they don&#8217;t, really. They may be planning and designing things around where consumer tech will be in 7-15 years, but they certainly aren&#8217;t using anything that far out in working prototypes. 3-5 maybe.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t really need powerful graphics, it&#8217;s certainly not needing to handle a lot of  hardware accelerated graphics. He wouldn&#8217;t need a backpack to hide whatever assistive tech he would be using to run them though, surely they could fit all of that necessary tech into a smartphone in his pocket to drive the glasses (which is, in my opinion, how they&#8217;re going to run anyway, not fully self-contained).</p>
<p>That awkward moment when Scroble looks deep into Brin&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;What a lovely blue&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>This will be an incredibly interesting next year or so. I just wish I had the budget to afford all these handy gimmicks. :(</p>
<p>As Dieter has said, ironically, if Google Glass can actually bring sight to the blind then that&#8217;s actually solving a real problem, sadly, it&#8217;s not</p>
<p>That&#8217;s cute. You think anyone has to solve &#8220;real problems&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one hell of an IF&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure you get what these glasses actually do! :S</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see the teen targeted ads in 5 years for not driving and wink-tweeting at the same time.<br />
This is obviously an early prototype. The real seller will be what flexible displays really hold promise for &#8211; transparent flexible displays.  Glasses that look no different but display hud info.</p>
<p>I am luddite-ish when it comes to &#8220;because-we-can&#8221; technologies and am not excited by this.</p>
<p>As a teen, and a driver, I&#8217;d just like to point out whenever I see anyone talking or texting on the phone, it&#8217;s ALWAYS an adult.</p>
<p>Sorry to imply that teens are the worst offenders. I personally don&#8217;t think age has anything to do with carelessness. The MADD&#8217;s and the like do however and usually fund the commercials.<br />
For example:<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0LCmStIw9E" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0LCmStIw9E</a></p>
<p>I hate to use words like&quot; stupid&quot; But I do not think there is any other word to describe this.</p>
<p>Very informative post!</p>
<p>You guys, I hate to use words like&quot; stupid&quot; But I do not think there is any other word to describe this.</p>
<p>The backpack seems strange given the environment, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was there to make the glasses work better somehow. That shouldn&#8217;t really take away from the potential of the glasses (or the potential of them being complete rubbish), it is just a prototype, I imagine it&#8217;s functional usage was extremely limited anyway.</p>
<p>Probably safe to assume that if they provided any functionality at all at this point it was simply a video display driven by a device in the backpack.  I would put more money on it simply being a dummy unit with a blue light that didn&#8217;t actually do anything.</p>
<p>Yeah, but at the same time, as I mentioned in another comment, anything they wanted to fake with these could have been managed with a smartphone in his pocket, not a backpack sized device of any kind. I am not convinced they were fully self contained (I&#8217;m not convinced the final product will be, I am guessing it will be more like a  bluetooth headset), but I don&#8217;t really\ think there was a computer powering it from the backpack or anything.</p>
<p>As Freud said, &#8220;Sometimes a backpack is just a backpack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Viagra and dentist ads, when you&#8217;re on the go.</p>
<p>Until I can get these in my prescription black-rimmed hipster glasses, I am afraid this won&#8217;t work for me.</p>
<p>Wait, so let me get this straight&#8230; You want maybe someday &#8230;.glasses from google, to replace the glasses you already have, so you can get more ads. FFS</p>
<p>Does Robert Scoble have a real job?<br />

<p>Don&#8217;t come back because the insight will be lost to the distraction of the internet. This is a great editorial piece. His understanding of the topic, ability to inform the reader and conciseness of opinion is unsurpassed by no other journalist. Quantity and quality in journalism are indirectly proportional and this is why Paul&#8217;s pieces keep on getting better.</p>
<blockquote>conciseness of opinion is <strong>surpassed</strong> by no other journalist.</blockquote>
<p>2 negatives make a positive:). There, I corrected that for you.</p>
<p>Wow, this piece truly looks amazing! Saved to Pocket for now, though.</p>
<p>Yep.  Just recently installed Pocket on my tab and loving it.  Is there a good Pocket alternative for WP7?  Pocket&#8217;s site suggested a few but I&#8217;d like to know what ppl think..</p>
<p>HOW WAS HE ABLE TO LOOK AT/BE ABLE TO POST THOSE VIDEOS???</p>
<p>but seriously, great article. The Verge truly is the best of the best when it comes to tech</p>
<p>A ton of work before going off the internet.</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; How did he get those clips etc without internet access?</p>
<p>Did he break his promise??</p>
<p>No promise breaking.</p>
<p>do you promise?</p>
<p>someone downloaded it and burnt it for him, or better yet, recorded it to a VHS tape in LP setting</p>
<p>You forgot to mention the MOD Live from Recon Instruments that you covered a while ago too :)</p>
<p>This picture showing info overlays looks remarkably like Watchdogs (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JcujYbctPk" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JcujYbctPk</a>):</p>
<p><img src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1201138/pg_vision.png" /></p>
<p>Ubisoft will be porting Watchdogs to Google Glass so you can play IRL, guns not included.</p>
<p>Speaking of guns, a small barrel-side attachment with a few sensors paired with glasses like these would be pretty kick ass at the shooting range.  It would make aiming a gun nearly instant if it were executed and calibrated properly.  I&#8217;d be interested to see how it managed the reticle when your face wasn&#8217;t directly behind/over the sights.</p>
<p>Well, images and concepts like this did exist long before Watch_Dogs.</p>
<p>well, there goes my tuesday&#8230; thanks Paul.. paul.. paul.. no really, thanks..</p>
<p><strong>paul, paul</strong></p>
<p>the verge should be called google .com  because they just forgot about Microsoft&#8217;s 10 year vision of the future which includes glasses &#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>the verge should be called apple .com because every writer owns an apple product</p>
<p>most of them probably also own a microsoft product as well. many also use android. I wonder what josh is using these days (as far as mobile goes). Can someone help me out on that?</p>
<p>I was mocking the above post. :P</p>
<p>And he was proving that your mockery was childish.</p>
<p>On the vergecast a couple of weeks ago Josh was still using a GNex. But with a super cool back cover.</p>
<p>was that worth mentionning ? and how would he have known without using google ?</p>
<p>Yeah, because Microsoft invented wearable computing!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yAOHX.gif" /></p>
<p>Wow. Where is Microsofts solid proof that their glasses exist? They probably do, but Google has shown video, photos and a concept video for their product, so that&#8217;s why they get attention.<br />
Microsoft fans&#8230;</p>
<p>Paul thurott was right when he said the verge gets their news for other sources&#8230;</p>
<p>1. This isn&#8217;t a news piece; it&#8217;s an editorial.<br />
2. Where does any information come from? Sources. And when those sources don&#8217;t pan out, you get other sources.<br />
3. Paul Thurott? You mean Jeffrey Dean Morgan?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a troll. Check his comment history.</p>
<p>He can hear you.</p>
<p>in ICS android text to speech does not rely on internet I think. It&#8217;s too fast.</p>
<p>A portable computer with offline capability would be awesome but maybe not within our reach in the next five years&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you not have a smartphone of some kind?<br />
Quad core processors running at around 1.5ghtz, probably faster by the time this is in stores&#8230; Maybe up to 2GB or RAM by then too?</p>
<p>The U.S. version of the Galaxy S3 already has 2gb of ram. Although it only has a dual core snapdragon s4 processor.</p>
<p>we are speaking of glasses&#8230; no quadcores smallers batteries and more battery life&#8230;</p>
<p>ICS&#8217;s speech-to-text <em>is </em>blazingly fast (especially on LTE), but it <em>does</em> in fact require an internet connection. If your phone is not connected to a network (mobile or WiFi), the microphone button that initiates the speech-to-text will dim and become inactive.</p>
<p>Have you tried using it in airplane mode?</p>
<p>The ICS voice recognition software (not TTS, that&#8217;s different) is fast because it doesn&#8217;t wait for you to end a sentence, it processes words one by one (or at least as fast as it can), kind of like how the handwriting keyboard in the Google Translate app works.<br />
But it&#8217;s still processed server-side.</p>
<p>my bad. But now it&#8217;s in Jelly Bean!</p>
<p>Yeah, awesome! :D</p>

<p>After reading that editorial, all I can say is (ironically) that it reminds me of this quote from you know who:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s To The Crazy Ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble-makers. The round pegs in the<br />
square holes. The ones who see things differently. They&#8217;re not fond of rules, and they have<br />
no respect for the status-quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify, or vilify them.<br />
About the only thing you can&#8217;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the<br />
human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.<br />
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world &#8211; are the ones who DO !&#8221;</p>
<p>Knock Google Glass if you like&#8230; but at least they are crazy enough to try. Kudos to them&#8230; they might miiight just, even if it&#8217;s a long shot, change the world with this.</p>
<p>Serious question, I&#8217;ve assumed Project Glass is simply some bogus tech concept that will never be made or work in reality. How is it possible that this could even exist, projecting useful info and graphics over our field of vision, if our plane of focus is 5-10-15-100 feet in front of us? When you focus your eye on something a centimeter or two away, you can&#8217;t see anything infront of you, and vice versa. For that matter, all these prototypes are projecting from an inch further from the glasses&#8217; lens &#8211; if they could build this &#8216;into&#8217; the lens so you&#8217;re not wearing completely nuts hardware, is it even physically possible to focus the eye that close?</p>
<p>you don&#8217;t need to, they use tricks(optical tricks) to make it appear as if it&#8217;s further away.<br />
.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never looked in to the viewfinder of a compact camera? that is only a cm or two away. Lenses can do amazing things in that regard.</p>
<p>Not to mention the lenses used in our ever-shrinking smartphones and laptops.</p>
<p>what&#8217;s about darth vader? :-)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be so great, once Siri learns enough and evolves into this new tech,  it will be revolutionary.</p>

<p>Girls in Project Glass photos  are like super models. Compare them to geeks with other devices:-)</p>
<p>When the tech moves on a bit, you could have  everyone look like that. Just have the glasses paste a supermodel head onto who ever you are talking to. They have a camera in them, so you could even add facial tracking so that placing an order with some fatty at the Captain D&#8217;s looks like you are talking to Adriana Lima.</p>
<p>Diminished and augmented reality is where this stuff is at for me. It may not be the first thing out the door when these are actually released by Google, but they stand to radically change how people live. Imagine an overcrowded future with billions more people where you can only afford to live in a small 300 sqft space (say in a large city like NYC where this could already be the case). These could change your living space for whatever occasion comes up (dinner, a movie, relaxation) so that it feels like you have numerous rooms, much more space, or just a cleaner less cluttered surrounding. You could live in a tiny dump and still be content, because the reality you perceive could seem much larger and luxurious. You have always wanted a hometheater that looks like a Ironman&#8217;s workshop? Done! The view from your couch to the wall 4ft away just became that as your kitchen table and bed to the side just melted away.</p>
<p>Creating virtual rooms would make no sence because you could not physically interact with anything in said virtual rooms. And in reguard to making things look less cluttered&#8230; just clean your shit man.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to interact.  I&#8217;m talking about making a space look like something else, purely for the visual aspect to improve quality of life. If you live in a depressingly small box, you could have it feel like you are sitting in a very grand space while you watch TV or something. Sure you can&#8217;t get up and walk over to the waterfalls in the distance, but it could distract you from the water damaged celing and pile of garbage in the corner. Or even simpler stuff like making the crappy view out of your window  (of the side of another building) appear to be something much nicer like a ski slope, or even pure fantasy like the cloud city from starwars. Crap stained motel matress? Not anymore!</p>
<p>As a secret nerd i would love something like wearable comuters, however i think its going to have to be something extremely successful in order to be seen out in the public with them.</p>
<p>Though far off, it would be good to have this stuff projected out from eye contacts, but i dont think we are going to see that in my life time.</p>
<p>Hahah yeah&#8230; I know what you mean. The Kardashians would have to wear a pair before my girlfriend would be cought dead in anything like the Google Glasses.</p>
<p>I think before you know it, they will just look like a pair of Oakley sunglasses or something, and the computer part will be your mobile device (phone) that is linked wirelessly to them. This is stuff most people already carry or wear regularly, so it wouldn&#8217;t stick out and could be accepted by almost anyone.</p>
<p>I like the one that deletes your enviornment. <br />
1) Delete all lamp posts so you have floating light EVERYWHERE!!!!<br />
2) Walk into invisible lamp posts because you can no longer see them&#8230;.<br />
3) ???<br />
4) PROFIT!!!</p>
<p>For number 4, more likely it will be businesses that pay google, and as sponsors get perks like the glasses auto deleting roaches from the floor in your hotel room, or making mcdonalds food look more like the commercials.</p>
<p>Wearable computer? How about a neuro linker? Wake me up when we can have Brain Burst. :)</p>
<p>Paul Miller!  You rock!!!</p>
<p>Great work, Mr Miller!<br />
Had never thought of the virtual reality headsets as wearable computers before. There was a book on military by Bill Gunston in the &#8217;80s which had a chapter on the future, and in amongst it all were the efforts at providing pilots with information that was always accessible. Some went as far as removing the real world, bringing up something that looked more like a vector scan graphics game than anything that would be thought of as practical &#8211; would you want to fly in an aircraft where the pilot was viewing a representation of reality as opposed to the readily available reality?</p>
<p>ALAN ALDA.</p>
<p>Totally agree, great article Paul.   The only perspective that I think is missing here is the wearable movement using smart synthetic fabrics and conductive materials.  This piece top lines a few of the trends which if done right may have more appeal to the non-geek types (myself excluded)   <a href="http://teleautomaton.com/post/1290838185/what-is-wearable" target="_blank">http://teleautomaton.com/post/1290838185/what-is-wearable</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2/jtr.jpg" /> I&#8217;ve heard of wearable computer concept before, but it&#8217;s still gonna be a long time til we see it commercialized.<img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2fj/fvx.jpg" /></p>
<p>I remember seeing Steve Mann at the Royal Ontario Museum back in &#8217;04 or &#8217;05, just by chance near the coat check. He was jacked in, clearly multitasking between the person in front of him and the eyepiece. It was weird.</p>
<p>Indeed, editorials such as this are what set the Verge apart from other tech news websites.</p>
<p>With Google Glass, the advancements in wearable computers has come the way of everyday people and their personal computing. Most of the computing we do in our personal lives happens remotely. For some of us at work, the need for a computer with a large tower maximized with RAM, multi-cores processors and a large video card and its exhaust fans still remains. Yet for most of us, our personal device is very simple with the intense computing happening off site. We require a robust data connection and not much else.</p>
<p>This is the world where something like Google Glass could perform well. The wearable itself can be a simple device and will rely heavily on a LTE connection to Google&#8217;s servers. If executed properly, Google will know a lot about the user and will anticipate the user&#8217;s needs in addition to performing on demand without getting in the way. Watching the Google Glass concept video post I/O 2012 is most telling in terms of what Google is currently launching and has in their labs. Notably, Google Now in Jelly Bean tracks the user&#8217;s habits, searches and location and learns one&#8217;s schedules and habits. At launch Google Now was lauded as a service that will anticipate the information you need based on location and habits. Google is also moving into the commercial server space by offering back-end computing solutions to the marketplace reviling Amazon. This move shall also give the company large amounts of data to improve its consumer devices.  Thus, the services released this year will feed into what will be the consumer version of Glass in a couple of years.</p>
<p>These were some of the shortcomings of the pervious research and studies in wearable computing over the past few decades. The technology and belief of the time was to make the computing happen locally, on the user. Having a company like Google, which is based in remote technologies will advance the wearables movement. If Google can show restraint and develop the economics of the device, Google Glass could succeed.</p>
<p>What? No mention of Jaron Lanier?</p>
<p>Verge, you guys missed a huge part of the story. Jaron Lanier was a pioneer of VR and VR goggles. This needs to be added to the article.</p>
<p>Jaron Lanier&#8217;s company that was founded to explore VR:  VPL Research, Inc.</p>
<p>Yea wearables have been around for ages, that much is actually obvious. Google&#8217;s just doing a great job at mainstreaming it. Sorry its not Apple, cause lord knows you&#8217;ll have a boner over it. If anything, Google should be recognized for pushing the bar.</p>
<p>I may be a tad late to the party, but there&#8217;s something the author is missing here..</p>
<p>Google Glass runs (of course) on Android. Google KNOWS that they don&#8217;t have all the answers here, so that&#8217;s why they sold the Explorer edition at I/O 2012. They WANT people to develop software for the thing, to generate new and exciting ideas and eventually, applications, that Google couldn&#8217;t possibly think of. <br />
They want it to be the next Kinect, and iIm hoping it gets that big in the hackerspace.</p>
<p>Oh, great&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. more patents, more fun. Heh.</p>
<p>My actual purpose in coming here was to complain about this article being more &#8220;serious journalism&#8221; (in air quotes) crap that does little more than stroke the egos of the editorial staff.</p>
<p>However, this actually proved to be quite readable and interesting, and I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to more in the series.</p>
<p>Both Apple and Google&#8217;s are excellent patents. Why? Because they&#8217;re for physical hardware and thus <strong>specific</strong>. If the patent were &#8220;One or more displays worn over the eyes&#8221; (paraphrasing, obviously it would be more tech jargon-filled), that would be ridiculous, as it would vaguely guarantee that an improvement or change may violate that patent.</p>
<p>This is what the patent system was made for.</p>
<p>However, the one-eye glasses do have a possible prior art:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.rubberslug.com/user/6258568a8d804292a8d932d5f4e4ded2/236101-3059152-VegetaScouter01.jpg" /></p>
<p>(Yes, I&#8217;m being facetious about that last bit.)</p>
<p>Now, based on this comment and prior comments you must take into account that the software will provide the greatest part of any utility for eyeglass-style computers.</p>
<p>But the important part is that improvements to both of these designs can be made. Two displays is significant and unique to one display.</p>
<p>This is true, and I have no idea why Google chose to go the single lens route. For one thing, if a person only has the use of one eye, they may not be able to use their device.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s so you can look past it. With only one lens/screen, it&#8217;s out of your main field of vision.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just my guess, since I never have and never will wear Project Glass.</p>
<p>Being a lefty, I paid attention to this in the I/O images and videos. From what I saw, there were units for both the left and right eyes.</p>
<p>Because it allows the illusion of a see-through display without actually having it be entirely see-through.</p>
<p>Example: Hold up an object to one eye. By doing so, you&#8217;re able to see both objects, but with a bit of focus, you can see one object clearer than the other. It doesn&#8217;t obstruct vision, while simultaneously allowing you to shift focus to it at any time, or simply see it out of the fuzzy peripheral of the combination of views from both eyes.</p>
<p>I was thinking more along the lines of this as prior art:<br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/LaserScope.jpg" /></p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s a patent&#8230; A wearable computer that attaches by sucking your ear.</p>
<p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bNYzhZfzJG8/TWoQ_Ez6pjI/AAAAAAAAD-4/gmg3ZAtbs4o/s1600/yugioh-zexal-promo.jpg" /></p>
<p>there&#8217;s also this.</p>
<blockquote>…stroke the eggs of the editorial staff.</blockquote>
<p>Fixed</p>
<blockquote>…stroke the Egg<strong>o</strong>s of the editorial staff.</blockquote>
<p>Now fixed</p>
<p>webOS?</p>
<p>LOL.</p>
<p>Did it hurt getting fixed?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll (Apple) still try to sue Google Glass out of existence.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t go after dumb products&#8230; nor dumb posts like this.    Learn a little about patent litigation before you flap your mouth about Apple.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Project Glass may be experimental and well&#8230; completely unproven (have we even seen anything other than its camera functionality yet?), but it certainly isn&#8217;t &#8216;dumb&#8217;.</p>
<p>Like it or not, wearable computing (hopefully in a more discrete form) is our future and a high-profile company like Google bringing it to the public&#8217;s attention is a very, very good thing as other companies will also take note and hopefully expedite their own R&amp;D in similar areas.</p>
<p>Hat computers!</p>
<p>Shoe phones?</p>
<p>Too late <a href="http://blog.streema.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/agent86.phone_.jpg" target="_blank">http://blog.streema.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/agent86.phone_.jpg</a></p>
<p>Shoe phone is from Get Smart and Max will kick your ass all over the back of his hand that he knows oh so very well&#8230;</p>
<p>Sure, wearable computers may be the future. But not an inch from your eye. I can see this only being used in niche industries. It&#8217;s just the latest stepping stone to something far more powerful.</p>
<p>Exactly. So when something is referred to as &#8220;the future&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t mean that it will be the end all be all device, he never alluded to any such thing. You built that up all by yourself.</p>
<p>Everything is a means to the next best thing but you still have to stop and enjoy the present.</p>
<p>Dumb products? Way to dismiss a product in it&#8217;s prototype stages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dumb products&#8221;. And what have you done today Einstein?</p>
<p>learn a little about flapping your mouth before you make dumb posts like this?</p>
<p>indeed, a product that displays content based on what it sees and hears and puts that content on a tiny transparent screen in front of a persons eye while not adding significant weight or discomfort to the user is &#8220;dumb.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google Glass does none of those things&#8230;except the lightweight part.</p>
<p>Have a look at the follwoing video on youtube, if you want a quick look at what they are working on:<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4&feature=player_embedded">Project Glass concept video from Google on April 4/2012</a></p>
<p>What was shown in the tech demo at Google IO(Which did not show the interface) and what was discussed isn&#8217;t the finish line for Project Glass.</p>
<p>I doubt this interface is nearly complete, or else they would have shown it. But what they are trying to build is fairly congruent with what Cbolton97 described according to Google.</p>
<p>I highly doubt &#8220;yomama84&#8221; was flapping his/her mouth. They more likely used a keyboard.</p>
<p>Really? Like… talking to us from the past?</p>
<p>Way to dismiss a product that isn&#8217;t even in the market yet. On top of that, Apple is inevitably going to pursue wearable computers. Don&#8217;t expect them to sit idly by either.</p>
<p>But the iPhone is a dumb product.</p>
<p>And Android phones is the dumbest product.</p>
<p>You, sir, may be the dumbest poster.</p>
<p>No dumber than the guy saying the iPhone is a dumb product.<br />
Immensely biased, and full of crap, is more likely than just dumb.</p>
<p>I hope this thread gets modded.</p>
<p><img src="http://gifsoup.com/view3/3901895/for-online-trolls-o.gif" /></p>
<p>No, you should learn a little about patent litigation before you pretend to know about it before you flap your mouth. The product is a prototype, it will probably be the first brick laid for so much technological advancement in the future, it is a real possibility that Apple may sue Google and what makes you so awesome to stroke your beard and pretend you are the wiseass douchebag patent litigation expert?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll just wait for it to go into production and then hit them with a lawsuit.  History has shown this is what apple does.</p>
<p>History as shown Apple only sues when it is infringing a patent directly related to something in their current product lineup. So if Apple doesn&#8217;t release a head unit, this will never, ever see a lawsuit. Also, they can&#8217;t sue unless the product is on the market, so your fear mongering post is true, but only because that&#8217;s reality.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re so full of zeal.. yomama84 was just sharing his opinion.. no need to be such a pretentious douche about it.. i mean.. this isn&#8217;t engadget or anything..</p>
<p>people need to chill the hell out..</p>
<p>u mad?<br />
need hug, maybe..?</p>
<p>I think that anyone even remotely knowledgeable about the patent wars that apple has been waging for the last few years is able to see that Apple is taking advantage of a broken system.  You don&#8217;t need to research patent litigation to know that and I&#8217;m pretty sure that you aren&#8217;t a patent lawyer so telling someone on a tech site that his post is dumb and to learn more about the subject is just being an arrogant d-bag. I&#8217;ll flap my mouth about my hatred for Apple&#8217;s lawsuits and horrendous human rights violations as much as I want.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>Google is going about Glass differently. First off, they&#8217;ve learned they need to gear up on patents. We&#8217;ve already seen some Glass related patents filed by Google and I have no doubt they have plenty more awaiting approval. They won&#8217;t make the same mistake they did with Android by being unprepared for IP warfare.</p>
<p>Secondly, Glass will more than likely be offered by Google directly and not through manufacturers like Android. That means that if Apple wants to fight, they&#8217;ll have to jump in the ring with Google themselves. Google has a much better legal team and a lot more money than any of it&#8217;s Android partners, so any legal battle would likely be bloody and harder for Apple to win. Look no further than how Google dealt with Oracle to see how a similar case with Apple might go.</p>
<p>Tim Cook has said he doesn&#8217;t like litigation, but he&#8217;s not going to stop as long as they&#8217;re winning and patent law stands as it is. However, Glass would present itself a much more significant legal challenge for Apple to take on and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d even try it. Picking on brands like HTC, Motorola, and Samsung is one thing but picking a fight with Google would also tarnish Apple&#8217;s squeaky clean reputation, especially considering Google will likely be the first to market with a product like this unlike with smartphones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim Cook has said he doesn’t like litigation, but he’s not going to stop as long as they’re winning and patent law stands as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>NEWS FLASH: Tim Cook is a flaming liar!</p>
<p>Show me one example of Apple suing someone for a patent not directly related to a product they currently have on the market. Apple doesn&#8217;t throw out random lawsuits. They only sue when other products infringe on their current device lineup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/04/uk-judge-rules-htc-doesnt-violate-apples-patents-invalidates/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/04/uk-judge-rules-htc-doesnt-violate-apples-patents-invalidates/</a> there you go.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say they didn&#8217;t lose. Only that the suits they file are directly related to products sitting on store shelves. The USPTO granted the patents. Apple has a right to defend them. A judge has a determines whether or not products actual do infringe, or if the patents are even valid.</p>
<p>The point of my comment is unless Apple actually makes a pair of wearable glasses, they will not sue like others in here seem to be suggesting.</p>
<p>Sure buddy there should only be one smartphone and one tablet that use multi-touch or the gesture to swipe to unlock a device by swiping from left to right. Your right Apple doesn&#8217;t throw out random lawsuits they just try to squash every android competitor that is innovating and actually making a dent in their market share. Why hasn&#8217;t apple sued lg or huawei when they have the same so called patent violations? It&#8217;s written in black and white and Apple&#8217;s mission has always been to squash android but they only go after the devices the manufacturers that are truly innovating the mobile industry. I swore by Apple products for years and I&#8217;ve owned i-phones and macbook pros in the past but all of these patent suits really have just left a sour taste in my mouth and I refuse to give them another dollar of my money.</p>
<p>These crybaby rants are getting very old.  Save the whining and complaining for your therapist. Based on what you wrote though it sounds like you agree 100% with jayfehr.</p>
<p>So by your logic, each and every phone on the market should be exactly the same, with no companies being able to develop new and exclusive features to differentiate themselves.</p>
<p>We need to protect innovation by preventing it!</p>
<p>Should Google be prevented from exploiting any patents they own relating to Google Glass?&#8230; or just Apple?</p>
<p>Name me one case where Google has used patents<strong> offensively</strong>. I&#8217;m pretty sure the only time they&#8217;ve ever used patents is defensively.</p>
<p>Offensively or defensively, either way it is irrelevant. If each company owns intellectual property and they are not getting full value by exploiting it, how are they delivering value for their shareholders?</p>
<p>How is a company supposed to get &#8220;full value&#8221;? Is licensing for a fee good enough or do only product bans get the &#8220;full value&#8221;? What if you don&#8217;t have a competing product to the one you&#8217;re trying to ban? What if you fail to ban your competitor&#8217;s product (which is usually the case)?</p>
<p>Well look at Google, and their $9.737 billion in profit last year and you have your answer.</p>
<p>Until very recently, they had no ammunition or reason to be on the offensive. No one is ripping them off and copying their stuff.</p>
<p>Oh really?<br />
Google Maps (and Earth).<br />
Google Mail.<br />
Hell, even Google+ features have inspired Facebook already.</p>
<p>And Google has sued others for trademark infringement: Froogles.com, GMAiL.pl. Not for patents, but certainly lawsuits, and morally iffy ones at that. Google&#8217;s hands are far from clean. Let&#8217;s stop pretending that they are some sort of saints that suffer the legal arrows of others while firing none of their own.</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with blocking competition or preventing others form innovating there own products.</p>
<p>&#8230;and has everything to do with protecting their name and reputation. When a logo and a web URL are all you have to guaranty a customer of the same safe and secure experience they&#8217;ve always had, its pretty darn important.</p>
<p>I think trying to equate trademark protection with patent litigation is a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>And Apple believes that they are protecting their name and reputation. They&#8217;re just using different ammunition. Seriously, it&#8217;s absolutely ridiculous for anyone to try and say that their gigantic multinational corporation is somehow wholly innocent or not playing the same game as everyone else.</p>
<p>You really should read up on these cases. The Froogles.com case is COMPLETELY about blocking competition, because only Google gets to use &#8220;&#8230;oogle&#8221; in any of their brand names, even if the other guy got there first.</p>
<p>MikeRoweSoft.com</p>
<p>look it up.</p>
<p>Trademark issues are on a different plane than patent litigation. With few exceptions, it is better for the consumer that he/she knows who a product is made by. It in no way would stop another company from making a product should their name and logo be easily distinguishable from another established one. I would say that trademark litigation is not as frivolous, and doesn&#8217;t care the same negative connotations as patent litigation (especially software patents).</p>
<p>Facebook copied 30+ features of Google+ already&#8230; I hate that&#8230;</p>
<p>Facebook, Please make little bit of tweak before rip it off.</p>
<p>Motorola.</p>
<p>zon.. that&#8217;s the best comment posted here in days! lol!</p>
<p>best sum-up of Apple&#8217;s principles!<br />
:)</p>
<p>The verge&#8230; all about removing patent litigation, yet posting this kind of news.   Its just as dumb as anyone wearing these geek glasses.</p>
<p>Remember The Jerk?   hehe&#8230;  nerds!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re conflating The Verge with 1) the opinions of Verge editors and 2) Judge Richard Posner. :)</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>He is saying while Josh and others may come out and say patents are a problem that doesn&#8217;t reflect everyone at The Verge, which is not a person, but rather made up of individuals with different thoughts, ideas, perceptions, and beliefs that will never line up in unison to point that you can state &#8220;The verge… all about removing patent litigation.&#8221;  In other words, If Josh says he is for something or against something that is Josh, not The Verge because he is only one element of The Verge even if he is the boss.</p>
<p>True but Josh is the face of the Verge so people will take what he says to represent the Verge. The same way people might take things Larry Page says as representative of Google.</p>
<p>This is why we need regular features like this one, written by experts like Matt and Nilay. People look to The Verge for guidance on subjects where they know little. Josh has an opinion (shared by many) but Matt and Nilay have a fuller understanding on the subject and can better explain each side of the argument.</p>
<p>Um, can you not read something and immediately know it is an editorial?  Obviously Josh can have his own opinions, Nilay and Josh have disagreements about the patent system.  He doesnt speak for a group.  Use some common sense.  The only thing that The Verge as a company had a stance on was SOPA.   And that was explicitly stated.  Put on your critical thinking hat and use your brain sometimes.  Editorials are what give a place like The Verge a unique voice, it is where a writer can flex his or her writing skills.  If you want only 250 word posts about tech news rehashing what&#8217;s fact at the moment, go to Gizmodo or Engadget.</p>
<p>Maybe you should take your own advice and read my comment carefully&#8230; I was stating why some people might get confused. I never stated that this is what I did dumbass&#8230; Next time try taking off your &#8220;dumbass&#8221; hat and reading what my comment said instead of assuming. Oh I forgot it is permanently glued on. Don&#8217;t ever try to talk to anyone about common sense or &#8220;using their brain&#8221; again!</p>
<p>These &#8216;geek glasses&#8217; are actually awesome.<br />
<img src="http://i32.photobucket.com/albums/d37/whitey5944/welcome-to-the-world-of-tomorrow.jpg" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what people say about these things, I&#8217;m getting a pair of (non-Apple) geek glasses and I&#8217;ll wear them proudly.</p>
<p>sooo.. still  no hug yet?<br />
 :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in favor of well written articles that explore and explain the fine points of obscure legal issues and this one is an excellent start.</p>
<p>Apple.  Patent everything just in case.®</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let Matt speak to this, but every good company patents boatloads of stuff — it&#8217;s just prudent. I used to work at GE, which actually has a patent scoreboard on its corporate R&amp;D campus for employees with the most patents filed.</p>
<p>Let me guess &#8211; they patented the patent scoreboard?</p>
<p>So funny.</p>
<p>Companies like IBM, 3M, Intel all file for enormous numbers of patents yearly.</p>
<p>But then they&#8217;ll actually license them as well, which IMO is the big sticking point.</p>
<p>They throw them in a pile and force people to pay. Apple only sues for patents that they are actually using. I would say that Apple is taking the better approach myself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heads up their asses, heads up their asses&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; Mike from Office Space..</p>
<p>I understand that Samsung and IBM are two of the biggest holders of patents.</p>
<p>I believe IBM even has a patent on patents.</p>
<p>Why is it suddenly the &#8220;cool&#8221; thing to dump all over Apple? Because they are the biggest company in the world? Are people only afraid of big companies? Apple at least represents a company that has earned its money by providing things to people that they love. I don&#8217;t understand the irrational sheeplike behavior.</p>
<p>Because Apple is currently using vaguely defined patents to take products that other people love out of the market for features Android had before iOS.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vaguely defined&#8221; by whom? They must used language that is common and acceptable by the US Patent and Trademark Office to describe whatever their patent covers. The language to describe patents <strong>is vague due to it&#8217;s very nature</strong>!</p>
<p>I suggest you randomly pull up 5 or 10 patents and take a quick read. It is not something lightly undertaken.</p>
<p>That should&#8217;ve read: &#8220;The language to describe patents is due to it&#8217;s very nature&#8221;</p>
<p>I know that. All software patnets tend to be vageuly define. It&#8217;s stupid. Software patents in general are stupid.</p>
<p><strong>why is everyone dumping on apple?<br />
</strong><br />
here&#8217;s just a few reasons, quite obviously the list can go on and on but i&#8217;ll just mention these for now:</p>
<p>vaguely defined patents to stop other companies from innovating and inventing new products for consumers.</p>
<p>the poor treatment and abusing the rights of chinese workers at foxconn and other plants (the issue exists because apple allow it to exist)</p>
<p>for stealing ideas from others and labeling these so called ideas as &#8216;magic&#8217; to woo customers.</p>
<p>apple is hated for thousands of reasons.. personally i like some of their products, i own a macbook pro, iphone and have often gifted apple products to friends family and loved ones. the reason why everyone is all up in arms is because very clearly apple is taking advantage of a broken system for its self gain. i can&#8217;t fathom notions of the blind apple fans.. i can&#8217;t believe that in such an age people are still so deluded and easily swayed by the utter bull crap..</p>
<p>surely even you splurge can understand these points? some of your comments do come across as very trollish; not sure wether that&#8217;s intended or part sarcasm or perhaps you&#8217;re just high lol..</p>
<p><strong>anyways.. please play nice and respect the opinions of others. peace! :)</strong></p>
<p>Nah, those are not &#8220;rational&#8221; reasons.  At least not legitimate ones.  I would rather you say you hate capital letters and Apple stole your mojo.  At least that can be based on something tangible.</p>
<p>dude.. i didn&#8217;t finish your apple juice &#8211; stop needlessly trying to trolling me. i don&#8217;t &#8220;hate&#8221; capital letters.. just don&#8217;t see why not / using them on the internet ought to be a dick waving contest for you to <em>try</em> to mock..</p>
<p>dude.. i didn&#8217;t finish your apple juice &#8211; stop needlessly trying to trolling me. i don&#8217;t &#8220;hate&#8221; capital letters.. just don&#8217;t see why not / using them on the internet ought to be a dick waving contest for you to <em>try</em> to mock..i get the culture and rationale of the apple of old.. but a darling it is no more.. they <strong>have</strong> changed dramatically from the core (pardon the pun) of everything they once stood for. if you can&#8217;t see that, then it plausibly ascertains a few things.. perhaps you choose not to see, perhaps you don&#8217;t care what you see or perhaps you are still in love with a girl whom i might add when you first met weighed 20lbs lighter and spoke no ill of others- and now does so.. whilst acting out like a middle aged whore surrounded by younger beauties.. each aiming to become new darlings, to new lovers.</p>
<p>how bizarre.. that comment wasn&#8217;t intended to make you feel a glitch in the matrix. anyways peace. :)</p>
<p>Yes, Apple works within and takes advantage of the patent system. No arguing that. They would be negligent not to. If we don&#8217;t like the patents they get or the manner in which they enforce them, that&#8217;s where the Patent Office and courts come into play. Oddly enough, a very small number of Apple&#8217;s patents have been invalidated through post-grant (reexam) processes at the Patent Office, or via the courts.</p>
<p>And, of course, there&#8217;s always legislative patent reform. I think most of us would agree that reform is needed, but nothing Congress has done to date on this issue indicates it knows how to address the complexities of the problems.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t trust the current generation of politicians to let their vote-driven opinions influence hugely impactful laws such as patent and copyright. They&#8217;d change the law to satisfy a bloc of voters and throw the economy into a further tailspin. They&#8217;ve already demonstrated they understand exactly squat relating to the economy.</p>
<p>I wish more people understood this. The courts get to decide. That&#8217;s how our legal system works. That&#8217;s the whole point of this litigation. Companies need to legally validate and strengthen their patents or risk being attacked by someone else. Apple learned that from Nokia. Google is learning it from Apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t read the article! Please upvote me!&#8221;</p>
<p>not sure why i am doing this&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/011011-patent-winners-ibm-apple.html">Samsung, Microsoft, Intel, Toshiba, Sony, IBM and many others have been the top of the yearly awarded patents list for years. Apple finally broke into the top 50 in 2010 with just 563 patents. The top 10 companies normally file thousands of patents (2,000- 6,000 each company &#8211; IBM first company to be awarded 5000 patents in a single year with  5,896 patents)</a></p>
<p>Obviously, it is the others patenting everything just in case.®</p>
<p>No. Some other companies have a poor history as well. Motoroloa&#8217;s suing of Apple for one. But Appl has a large track record of using patents aggressively.</p>
<p>Probably because they are patenting things they actually make, instead of every idea that bounces in their heads&#8230;</p>
<p>HTC and Samsung do not make for <em>&#8216;a large track record of using patents aggressively&#8217;</em>.</p>
<p>pull your head out of the sand you over sized Ostrich, HTC and Samsung phones have or are being banned because of agreesive tactics. Both phones from both companies have complied, yet both phones got a ban&#8230; tell me that isnt aggressive.</p>
<p>PS $96,000,000 to get the ban on the Gnex.</p>
<p>And Apple phones had to have features removed in Germany for these same types of cases. It&#8217;s the same all around. People on the google side of things seem to think Apple is the one litigating here, and that&#8217;s just crazy. Apple has as many incoming lawsuits as outgoing ones, they aren&#8217;t somehow out there trying to litigate the competition into submission.</p>
<p>I should also mention Microsoft is one of the worst, if not the worst.  They&#8217;re exctracting royalties from a large portion of the tech world.  However, they tend to just ask for royalties, and Apple tends to completely shut the product down, and thus all innovation it brought.</p>
<p>1. I was simply proving the guys assumption about Apple was wrong. I was not staying that I agree with what Apple is doing 100%. I have not stated anything about my perspective about any of it.  Yet, you say no it is not the other companies patenting everything just incase? I was countering and disproving the original commenters comment that it is Apple patenting everything in case. You say No?</p>
<p>2. You can&#8217;t compare Microsoft to Apple because they are totally different business models&#8230; Apple sells hardware and offering the better features and the patents (ownership) to the technology to provide those features give them a competitive edge. Licensing them gains them nothing. Microsoft has always been a company that made its money from software, software licenses and services. Licensing patents suits their business model beautifully not Apple&#8217;s.</p>
<p>3. Google is not innocent in any of this at all and it took Apple 2 years from the launch of the G1 to file the first lawsuit because there was peace talks but those stopped in 2010 because Google choice to escalate things by enabling Multitouch. They weren&#8217;t enabling it by default and were leaving it up to OEMs because they didn&#8217;t want a shit storm. Steve Jobs hurt their feelings and they retaliated enabling it and months later Apple responded with first suit filed against HTC. Google knew what it was doing, it chose to play with fire knowing very well this shit storm would happen. I don&#8217;t feel sorry for them one bit.</p>
<p>Might I add that Apple is out of hand with it right now, but Google is the new kid on the block and Apple is obviously out to teach them a lesson. But Apple&#8217;s lawyers appear to be suggesting they use any patent they have that has a chance of sticking which is total BS. Use the legit patents filed between 2005 and 2012 involving mobile devices, or wise drop the shit and stop wasting everyone&#8217;s time.</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s what Google is doing with Motorola right?  Cough &#8211; pager patent from the 90s &#8211; cough.</p>
<p>Android and Samsung are the only products Apple has ever gone after with that much veracity, and it&#8217;s not to shut down competition or innovation, it&#8217;s to right a perceived wrong. I really wish our tech savvy society had a memory of more than 18 months&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, then what was the lawsuit against Microsoft and Windows copying Mac?</p>
<blockquote>I really wish our tech savvy society had a memory of more than 18 months…</blockquote>
<p>See above statement for irony.</p>
<p>You mean the one from 1988? That one had nothing to do with patents,</p>
<p>So? Apple came after Microsoft with no less &#8220;veracity&#8221; and &#8220;to right a perceived wrong&#8221;. And it was all about IP, which patents are a form of(FYI).</p>
<p>They ended up reaching a settlement with Microsoft so obviously their case had some merit.</p>
<p>At no point in that case did Apple try to stop the sales of Microsoft&#8217;s products. I&#8217;d still say that Apple&#8217;s cases against Samsung and Google are not indicative in any way of a larger trend. In fact, if anything, they go pretty strongly against Apple&#8217;s history in courts. To that point, Apple doesn&#8217;t &#8220;tend to completely shut the product down, and thus all innovation it brought.&#8221; They&#8217;re just fighting extra hard here, because they believe it was a much more serious breach of trust they put in their partner.</p>
<blockquote>At no point in that case did Apple try to stop the sales of Microsoft’s products</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that disputes over copyright, when the question of copyright itself is disputed ever resulted in a preliminary injunction.  Also, Apple did go after Psystar and successfully stopped them.</p>
<p>So, please please, please&#8230;. detect the irony in your complaint that people only remember the last 18 months.</p>
<blockquote>Also, Apple did go after Psystar and successfully stopped them.</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, because they were doing things that went against Apple&#8217;s licensing policies. There was no workaround for that, Psystar knew that before they ever went into business.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Apple go after Microsoft with this level of veracity?  <br />
Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation, 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994)</p>
<p>In fact it seems like Google is doing much of what Microsoft did back then, only now in the mobile space.  Apple tried to get it appealed up to the Supreme court but was denied.</p>
<p>i also wish you would read something about a company called Kodak, and how Appl tried to stop them from licensing/selling their patents with bogus claims that have just been struck down in court..</p>
<p>Apple developed those patents alongside Kodak, they were partners at the time. That&#8217;s why they were trying to stop the sale, they were fighting for their share of the patents.</p>
<p>Kodak was completely different. Apple felt they had a right to some ownership of the patents they helped Kodak develop, instead of those rights just being sold because the company went under.</p>
<p>you are absolutely right! that is why their claim was struck down by the court<br />
:)</p>
<p>MS says pay us this, and you can use it. thats called FAIR PLAY!</p>
<p>Apple saying, we wont license and now will sue you for using something we thing infringes on what we wouldnt license.</p>
<p>so how is that worse than apple?</p>
<p>makes sense, those companies actually do the innovating!  trollololol</p>
<p>I remember when Motorola R&amp;D came in to our university looking for fresh hires. They advertised the positions, talked about your roles in the company.</p>
<p>Then they mentioned how <em>important it would be for you to write patent applications</em> once you started working for them. They really emphasised this point. Every company does this, not just Apple.</p>
<p>I work for a large tech company that gives monetary awards for every patent filed, and then doubles it if the patent is granted.  Once you get a certain number of granted patents (I forget how many exactly, maybe 10?) you get another large bonus on top of that.  And I know for a fact that some of the patents the company files aren&#8217;t actually planned to be used in a product, at least not in the near term.  Its basically done &#8220;just in case&#8221;.</p>
<p>Google is stating to look all smug now with this project glass like apple fans. I mean look at the smug douchebag face on that guy.</p>
<p>How dare he smile, that douche!</p>
<p>You call that a smile? More like &#8220;I&#8217;m better than you fuckers&#8221; kinda look. I bet anyone who wear those in the streets get mugged or his ass kicked.</p>
<p>I see everything you just said.</p>
<p>.. I don&#8217;t even know what to say.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sometimes curious as to how people survive in the real world if they are anything like their online persona, the persona that seemingly doesn&#8217;t care to filter out these needless attacks on a person and what they are based on something so trivial as this.</p>
<p>Looks more like he was smiling and talking when the photo was taken. You have antisocial behavior issues. I can tell because I do too. It&#8217;s terrible, and only entertaining to others with the same problem.</p>
<p>bring it on, not like they wont be trackable, or even take a picture of the dude mugging me trying to kick my ass, get a few good &#8220;mug&#8221; shots for the cops,  and have a recording of the actions, no Trayvon murder happening to me&#8230;</p>
<p>so you&#8217;re calling Sergey Brin (one of the co-founder&#8217;s of Google) a douche?</p>
<p>I am. God forbid we&#8217;re not allowed to criticize someone who looks like a douche in that pic. I don&#8217;t think he needs your defence when he&#8217;s sleeping in his pile of money.</p>
<p>Why does money incite such envy and hatred?</p>
<p>You must not be poor.</p>
<p>He may not need it, but he&#8217;s gonna get it anyway.  You are projecting your own douchiness onto him.  Sergei Brin is a man&#8217;s man and a geek&#8217;s geek.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn3.hark.com/images/000/204/422/204422/original.jpg" /></p>
<p>care to post your own picture here so we can judge your &#8220;douchiness&#8221; by it?</p>
<p>Does his status as a founder of a company somehow automatically make him not a douche?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying he is, I&#8217;m just saying, his name and position with google have nothing to do with his ability to be a douche.</p>
<p>Did you not see the implied &#8220;/s&#8221;?</p>
<p>This sounds like a 3D version of Glass.</p>
<p>Yes. That could really shut Glass out of many nascent medical and industrial applications.</p>
<p>no&#8230;</p>
<p>the patent reads like it&#8217;s a 3d head mounted display with &#8220;ambient&#8221; color support.</p>
<p>which is like <a href="http://museum.bounce-gaming.net/vfx1.html" target="_blank">http://museum.bounce-gaming.net/vfx1.html</a> but with two extra leds and some processing.</p>
<p>Thought project glass was a cool idea but this makes me laugh. <br />
<a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma8NbpCvSwo" target="_blank">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma8NbpCvSwo</a></p>
<p>This one is better IMO.<br />

<p>Apple wants to patent technology.</p>
<p>Every tech company wants to patent technology.</p>
<p>This is a great piece, and it makes me sad that going by the comments so far a lot of people didn&#8217;t bother reading it.</p>
<p>That or they&#8217;re just being willfully ignorant.</p>
<p>I think both apply, and possibly also, #3) They didn&#8217;t understand it.</p>
<p>There should be a pop quiz at the end of each earticle to make sure you read and understood it, that unlocks the comments section.</p>
<p>I can see Google Now being one of the first apps for the Google Glass.  I can&#8217;t wait!!!</p>
<p>just proves how screwed up this patenting system is. instead of just providing a &#8220;blue-print&#8221; of an idea, they should require a working prototype and a deadline for releasing it to market. you know, so that OTHERS can do it if the party initially granted the patent failed at delivery. patents should also be for a shorter amount of time (20 years is bullshit, at least in the tech market)&#8230;.</p>
<p>How do you know Apple doesn&#8217;t have a working prototype in a lab somewhere?</p>
<p>Because every single product only takes three weeks to develop and another week to ship. Or so every commenter everywhere actually thinks.</p>
<p>how do you know that someone else isn&#8217;t working on a similar idea/device?</p>
<p>I respect the journalism but I don&#8217;t like the fact that it exists. It&#8217;s giving Apple ideas I hope they don&#8217;t act on (someone at Apple has to read The Verge).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so silly that we even have to have this article, basically outlining HOW Apple WILL sue Google over a product that barely even exists yet.</p>
<p>Maybe try reading the article first.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Then how could you possibly think its giving Apple ideas? Furthermore, what the heck do you think the Verge is going to say that Apple hasn&#8217;t already thought of? Between this and the &#8220;OMG send it to google&#8217;s lawyers&#8221; nonsense, I&#8217;m beginning to wonder how stupid, or willfully ignorant, some commenters on here actually are&#8230;</p>
<p>If  my discussions are too much for you I&#8217;d much rather you ignore them sir. Your negativity is what&#8217;s killing the comments in my view.</p>
<p>Too much? No, they&#8217;re of too little substance, frankly.</p>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
<p>Yeah, I see that you somehow think your trolling &#8220;Oh god, now Apple has new ideas for how to ruin the world&#8221; is somehow contributing to&#8230;well&#8230;nothing. I&#8217;ll call you out on baseless, moronic nonsense as long as you keep posting it, even if it does make me sound negative.</p>
<p>You only make yourself look foolish. I notice you attack people a lot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not attacking you.<br />
I&#8217;m calling you out on your crap.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re airing out frustration, via the web, semi-anonymously.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not frustrated. You&#8217;re the one suggesting that Apple trolls tech article comments for lawsuit and patent ideas&#8230;<br />
Do you not see how silly that sounds?</p>
<p>I guess if you were a zealot as much as I suspect, but I had no forewarning of this beforehand, so here we are.</p>
<p>Zealot?<br />
I&#8217;m the zealot because I&#8217;m pointing out how silly you sound?<br />
Amazing.</p>
<p>Otherwise you wouldn&#8217;t have cared so much to try to be the internet police against blog comments you don&#8217;t like, but you win the point, if there was one amid your anger.</p>
<p>Oh, I don&#8217;t care that much, but I was here, so I called out what was an idiotic post.<br />
No anger.<br />
Again, a very silly thought process on your end, I&#8217;m not surprised at this point how far you&#8217;ll go to validate your silliness.</p>
<blockquote>Oh, I don’t care that much</blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t be so modest! You already won.</p>
<p>people on verge are dumb trolls.. sigh</p>
<p>They seem to be getting dumber&#8230;</p>
<p>I usually follow a rule where I only read the comments if the article is fresh and there&#8217;s less than 10. Any more and it is just infuriating.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like limiting yourself to just the two top voted comments on a youtube channel, 9/10 times everything else is lol.</p>
<p>Continuations have new claims, but must support the original patent specification.  In other words, if you&#8217;ve written a stereo patent, with stereo claims, you can&#8217;t later add mono claims if there&#8217;s nothing about it in the specification.</p>
<p>I applaud Google trolling Apple, taking a chance on the latter&#8217;s ideas. After all it&#8217;s the specific implementation that counts and that can be patentable.</p>
<p>That claim basically covers an binocular headset with a Philips Ambilight stuck on it (which one might consider lacks an inventive step). If anyone is interested, you can look at the image file wrapper by looking up the application as US PAIR (google it), the going to &#8220;all documents&#8221;. This will show you the initial rejection from the USPTO, and the arguments made in response. Third parties are allowed to file observations on pending cases and the Examiner will take them into account, so if anyone think they can provide better arguments than the examiner (for a pending case), go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>at</strong> US PAIR</p>
<p>and it&#8217;s &#8220;image file wrapper&#8221; not all documents (I&#8217;m used to the EPO system)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Project glass will grow to be anything more than a camera with a unique prespective. Period. It won&#8217;t be like a smartphone or any device with mass adoption.</p>
<p>Apple never used a patent against its competitioners which they don&#8217;t use themself. Btw. this is why they arn&#8217;t patent trolls, too.</p>
<p>Why are they allowed to file patents for products or designs they don&#8217;t build? That used to be a requirement of the patent system. It should be brought back.</p>
<p>How do you know they&#8217;re not building it? They were working on the iPhone since 2003-ish, and no one saw anything of it until 2007.</p>
<p>A long time ago &#8211; perhaps in the mid 1990s, Sun, Apple, HP or someone released a concept video showing a young man and woman at a cafe conversing in opposing languages. I don&#8217;t recall which, but one of them was wearing glasses that displayed a heads up real-time translation of what the other was saying.</p>
<p>(I have tried to locate this in YouTube to no avail. I wonder why it isn&#8217;t on YouTube?) :P</p>
<p>God I hate this stuff. Apple has brought nothing to the market, yet has now clamped down any kind of 3d wearable computing.</p>
<p>I hate 3d in the theater, but imagine combining Google Glass with the Kinect to not only have a 2 dimensional graphic overlay, but an interactive 3d augmented reality system. That would be awesome! But it&#8217;s also an obvious evolution of the technology that we see today. It shouldn&#8217;t be patentable.</p>
<p>You want someone to bring it to market, but you won&#8217;t afford them a patent for it?</p>
<p>They filed the patent in 2006.<br />
Do you understand that? It&#8217;s not an obvious evolution of what we see today, because it was a patent filed 6 years ago.</p>
<p>Is project glass putting us one step closer to singularity?</p>
<p><a href="http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/07/towards-singularity.html" target="_blank">http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/07/towards-singularity.html</a></p>
<p>Thank you, I&#8217;m not alone.</p>
<p>The news story that wasn&#8217;t..</p>
<p>This patent seems to have prior art written all over it.  I can&#8217;t recall which program it was, but it was at least a decade ago, and the program was about display technologies with respect to holographic technology as well as heads up displays and helmet mounted displays for the military.</p>
<p>The program also discussed techniques for dealing with stereoscopic vision and the challenges of 3d displays and holograms depicted in science fiction movies.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s pattern of patent applications is to immediately apply for a patent when they see a technology on television, or in a movie.  Who wants to bet that Apple is trying to apply for patents based on all the technology and ideas presented in the new movie Prometheus???</p>
<p>so what this means is that one year after project glass hits the market, Apple will release a pair of shades called iGlass. and scream INNOVATION from the highest mountaintops</p>
<p>Godlike comment is godlike!</p>
<p>Google, Samsung, Asus, Nokia, Microsoft, LG, and HTC should just pool all their best IT guys and just hack the US patent office to remove all the BS patents Apple have.</p>
<p>I mean enough is enough.</p>
<p>The way I read it is that it would cover stereoscopic 3D glasses. This would allow items to be displayed with depth. You simply can&#8217;t do it with a single lens.</p>
<p>Google make products &amp; service and try to get them out there.</p>
<p>Apple sit there patenting all day so at some point in the future they can sue someone or stifle innovation.<br />
Trolls</p>
<p>I dont think they want to upset Google! Google will rule the world  one day!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.Top-Privacy.tk" target="_blank">www.Top-Privacy.tk</a></p>
<p>This is awesome!</p>
<p>Until the fragmentation starts&#8230; :S</p>
<p>Ouch, fragments in my eyes.</p>
<p>Dude, you got some + in your eye.</p>
<p><img src="https://p.twimg.com/App5xa2CQAEFJ37.jpg" /></p>
<p>Take this on your microsoft&#8217;s troll face!</p>
<p><img src="https://j0tpgg.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pC-TSQvocIH3jYbaU3Eyfk1hvoYtUQRzTPB2Vu9AGlD8Yea89V8ppipUi34LCbOuAPnvSg-VvPI8v6LGQ8rmpiQ/troll_spray.gif" /></p>
<p>You do realize that&#8217;s the only reason Google is doing this right? Ads in your eyes.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t need to put the ads in your eyes&#8230; if they can see everything you do all day when you look for anyplace the right add will be there. Google will collect the perfect LIFE direct ad system with that.</p>
<p>If they are charging for it, and making a profit on the sale, it most definitely should not be ad subsidised at any point in it&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Of course they might want to do something like Amazon did with a full price and slightly-cheaper ad-subsidised Kindle, as long as the ads are subtle (like the Kindle), that&#8217;d work.</p>
<p>think like android, it doesn&#8217;t have ads in the OS, but most of the free applications do, as well as the web sites you visit. They aren&#8217;t directly putting ads in it but the more connected you are the more time on the web you spend the more ads you will see</p>
<p>One of the other benefits of Android for Google is that it boosts the adoption of Google products that includes ads.</p>
<p>Yea. And it&#8217;s so depressing to know that everyone has no choice BUT to use this meaning EVERYONE will get ad in their eyes, including you. Seriously, I wish people would have the freedom to choose to <em>not</em> use Google products for people like you. Such an unfair world. /s</p>
<p>I never said that people didn&#8217;t have a choice. I am completely absorbed into the Google ecosystem. They know everything about me and I could care less. I was just pointing out that SeNiLe was not trolling, and that is exactly what Google would do if they made these glasses. I don&#8217;t care, I would buy them anyways.</p>
<p>Oh, i thought they were doing it &#8217;cause they want to be the next <em>Ray-Ban</em></p>
<p>Ray-Ban: Bought By Google.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft never sells ads.</p>
<p>You mean, despite all their efforts?</p>
<p>Silly! everyone knows that M-soft is a harvester of souls!!!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m immune to this GIF since I created it.</p>
<p>c&#8217;mon!! that was funny!</p>
<p>Meh. Just root them and install CatBlock.</p>
<p>&#8230;but i still want!</p>
<p>How it looks like when Microsoft steal this project from Google&#8230;?</p>

<p>Come on bro, should have gotten the iEye. Now with a REAL retina display.</p>
<p>Haters gonna hate.</p>
<p>Ouch, you went there and it hurt.</p>
<p>not really, the concept looks pretty damn cool but its google meaning this will beta on for about a year then get ditched for a hat or something. And where is the audio output? I hope they don&#8217;t try jamming radios into this and just let it work with widi or bt</p>
<p>I want my connected hat, i want it damn it! My hat needs to buzz when i get email, if it doesn&#8217;t, they blew it.</p>
<p>Finally I can play that frisbee and horn game while Ashley Judd watches me. Look at those amazing 25th century graphics! This will raise my dopamine levels right? Right?<br />

<p>This! You beat me to it, hat&#8217;s off to you sir.</p>
<p>so I&#8217;m guessing the glasses pull all this data from your Android phone???  This looks really cool if it works as well as it does in the video</p>
<p>According to the reports; the glasses incorporate an android terminal.</p>
<p>FAWESOME &#8211; fuggin awesome! Mind =  Blown!</p>
<p>The dark net</p>
<p>I need these, just less nerdy looking and im good</p>
<p>WHAT? No that&#8217;s the shtick. The nerdier the better.</p>
<p>Add blinking colored lights and a long antenna!</p>
<p>Green antennas, obviously.</p>
<p>Geek card revoked!<br />
It&#8217;s antennae!</p>
<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antenna" target="_blank">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/antenna</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s antennas for the radio antenna, antennae for an animal antenna.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s funnier: the fact that you made a mistake spelling while correcting a spelling you don&#8217;t like OR the fact that you said ass.</p>
<p>Sir, I don&#8217;t make mistakes. It was intentional.</p>
<p>And optical zoom!</p>
<p>I would say the design so far is intentionally slim in order to be able to integrate it in different forms and sorts of glasses :) I&#8217;m sure they will not (only) look like that in the end</p>
<p>It would be cool to eventually buy a pair of glasses with this built in &#8211; especially if you already wear glasses like me.</p>
<p><strong>At lens crafters</strong> &#8220;I would like non scratch lenses, bifocals, and Google Glass please.&#8221;</p>
<p>that would definitely be cool although bifocals are (read &#8216;should be&#8217;) a thing of the past. you can get progressive lenses now which have no visible lines as the prescription changes. they&#8217;re more expensive but well worth the extra dough.</p>
<p>Actually, what we need are those SuperFocus lenses, with a built in auto adjusting  laser rangefinder, and do away with fixed lenses altogether&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d make them even more nerdy with LED lights everywhere</p>
<p>This will actually be useful when it&#8217;s in a contact or embedded in our brains. 10 years.</p>
<p>I do agree, but that&#8217;s when I begin to get worried about technology.</p>
<p>I want a Borg laser pointer attached to it.</p>
<p>Trendy.</p>
<p>TAKE ALL MY MONEY UNTIL THE END OF TIME</p>
<p>If its from Google, won&#8217;t it be free*?</p>
<p>Ahh heads up ads. There has to be a meme of that.</p>
<p>Until Google starts implanting LightSpeed briefs advertisements in my dreams I won&#8217;t be complaining.</p>
<p>they&#8217;ll just flash subliminal ads while you are using these glasses.</p>
<p>Must&#8230;&#8230;buy&#8230;&#8230;.Nexus&#8230;.device&#8230;.</p>
<p>How quickly will you throw them away when your glasses ask you if you would like to have a bigger dong, or lose weight, or date a better looking girl?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there will be a power button to turn them &#8216;Off&#8217;.</p>
<p>Then what the hell is the point of wearing them? Please don&#8217;t say &#8220;cauese they look cool .&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure these will need to be charged. Why would there be an always-on device to waste battery when you&#8217;re not using it??</p>
<p>You wear them when they are powered ON. Do you use your cellphone while powered off?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember the last time I turned my cellphone off, but I see what ya mean.  That actually raises a pretty good question: What&#8217;s the battery life like on these things?</p>
<p>OHHH, augment a pretty face over your ugly dates face!!</p>
<p>Everybody wins!!!</p>
<p>If these come with Google Wallet integration where you can just look at an NFC tap thing and pay&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be buying a set on launch just to watch people freak out when the register tells them I paid without doing anything.</p>
<p>Headbutt the register?</p>
<p>LMAO</p>
<p>You made me actually laugh out loud &#8211; good show.</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y12/evil9961/bang-head-on-keyboard.gif" /></p>
<p>out&#8230;of&#8230;my&#8230;chair! That visual is fckn hilarious&#8230; clerks already are clueless when I use Google Wallet. Suddenly smashing the register with your forehead is of Epic proportions!</p>
<p>Wow! I laughed so hard! At work..</p>
<p>Oh my god&#8230; where are the lenses??</p>
<p>Brain implants :o</p>
<p>Thats what it needs to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also like to have a 32GB micro sd card implanted specifically for mobile porn on demand while commuting.</p>
<p>^^^don&#8217;t look him in the eyes while he&#8217;s wearing google glasses.</p>
<p>LOL, unless you&#8217;re a female, you have no worries bro.</p>
<p>Good to know !!</p>
<p>The image is projected into your eyes by reflecting it off a small piece of glass.</p>
<p>It looks like there&#8217;s no actual lenses. It&#8217;s just the frame with a tiny computer screen above the right eye.</p>
<p>I wear actual glasses, wonder how they would look on me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking along these lines. I wear actual glasses, so I hope that you can wear contact lenses with these Glasses or you can get lenses to a prescription for &#8216;normal&#8217; glasses.</p>
<p>Anyhow, these look awesome, can&#8217;t wait until I get my hands (eyes?) on them!</p>
<p>The article mentions there is a version for those who wear actually vision correcting glasses</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the beauty of it. If you have these, you don&#8217;t need to see real life!</p>
<p>dorky :P</p>
<p>I have to think people who wear glasses would have to have special glasses with lenses built in.</p>
<p>Actually when I think more about it, it shouldn&#8217;t really matter. This can be placed behind your daily glasses and since the image is being directed literally a centimeter or so from in front of your eyes I find it hard to think that it would be hard to see for nearsighted people(like me).</p>
<p>nah I disagree. When you go to the cinema and have to wear two pairs of glasses it is incredibly uncomfortable, I imagine this might be similar. They would hit each other, especially if you wear a larger framed pair of specs.<br />
That said, if this ever takes off, I have to think they would make them look more like regular glasses, or at least for people who wear glasses. People with glasses are the obvious customers, it is a lot easier to persuade someone to get new awesome glasses than to persuade someone to start wearing something on their face where there used to be nothing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure, if made into a consumer product, there would be a prescription glasses form</p>
<p>These give Sight+10.</p>
<p>Same here. I wonder how look/will feel.<br />
This is really amazing though. Can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on something like this one day.</p>
<p>This looks so amazing. Who said Google wasn&#8217;t innovating??</p>
<p>This is a concept video like Microsoft&#8217;s Courier or Productivity Future Vision or something. When they actually ship something then we&#8217;ll talk. Shipping means building it at a price that sells and user experience that&#8217;s practical. So not a $5000 device, nor something that needs charging every 2 hours, etc.</p>
<p>Too be fair they don&#8217;t look too expensive, at the end it&#8217;s just a small projector with some bluetooth/wifi connectivity</p>
<p>And I doubt a device without a screen would need to charge every 2 hours.</p>
<p>It would need a cell data radio, or else these would be pointless.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the point of the bluetooth. To connect it to your phone for it&#8217;s cell radio.</p>
<p>It would be pointless with bluetooth. Why carry two devices that do the same thing?</p>
<p>you can control your phone with your eyes, see everything without holding anything.. it seems to me this &#8211; as a phone add on &#8211; would be a perfect way to implement with a lower cost.</p>
<p>ever heard of a headset?</p>
<blockquote>In late February, Nick Bilton reported that &#8220;Google employees familiar with the project&#8221; confirmed the glasses would be available to the public for around $250 to $600 dollars by the end of 2012.</blockquote>
<p>That would be a good start. I will reserve judgement until the first real demo before getting too excited.</p>
<p>Agreed. As much as I think this is a cool idea, I&#8217;m frankly disappointed that Google decided to release a concept video before they were actually ready to show off at least the prototype. It makes me doubt even more if the technology is even there yet. If they were much closer to release like &#8220;Nick Bilton&#8221; reported, they should have something more practical to show at this point rather than some black and white shots of people wearing what it &#8220;could look like&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the Azteks predicted, Google Glass will begin a new era of man.</p>
<p>These glasses will most likely be put out to market unlike the Courier.</p>
<p>These glasses will most likely be put out to pasture like the Courier</p>
<p>Google ain&#8217;t Microsoft, they actually let their products flop in the market.</p>
<p>I hope they do make them. But you know theses are gonna be regulated like crazy. You think they are gonna let people even think about driving with these.</p>
<p>Exactly. They are trying to outlaw bluetooth headsets, this is much worse. When we have self-driving cars it won&#8217;t matter though, and that is about when these things will be miniaturized enough to not look ridiculous.</p>
<p>They are already testing it. Microsoft likes to show off videos 20 years into the future and they don&#8217;t even get it right.</p>
<p>remember surface?</p>
<p>You mean <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/purchaseprocess.aspx" target="new">this surface?</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s out there, you just have to call Samsung.</p>
<p>Its not a concept its set for release in 2012 as all the articles mention.  Google does not have a history of novelty projects that never see the light of day like Microsoft, Intel, Sony.  They are leaps ahead in innovation, and even farther in R&amp;D, of any tech conglomerate.  People were just as skeptical about the self driving car, but that project left the google garage (hehe) and is already in widespread testing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not set for release in 2012. One guy said it would be, another guy said it wouldn&#8217;t be. Neither of them are on the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are leaps ahead in innovation, and even farther in R&amp;D, of any tech conglomerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any idea where that came from. Moreover, its a totally false statement; evidently and statistically.</p>
<p>&#8216;People were just as skeptical about the self driving car, but that project left the google garage (hehe) and is already in widespread testing.&#8217;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whom you are referring to but almost everybody was optimistic about self driving cars. Research in Machine Learning which is the most exploited topic in Artificial Intelligence has intensified in recent years. Self-driving cars or technically known as &#8216;Autonomous Cars&#8217; are not a new invention. Companies around the globe have funded a number of projects at various research centres at a number of universities.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, Google has invested a lot in self driving cars mainly because they need them global terrain mapping; not undermining their effort, but research and development was existent much before Google invested in self driving cars.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/303647/20120223/google-goggles-glasses-heads-up-display-hud.htm" target="new">It was rumored that these devices would be #250-$600</a>. Seems to be various options and configurations (basic to advanced). It looks like Google is creating a consumer product market here!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that would be a good thing if there is that much variation in price. I think it would result in, dare I say?, <em>fragmentation</em>.<br />
Half trolling aside, this kind of device is one thing that I wouldn&#8217;t want billions of  differing hardware options floating around. Imagine the performance gap between high end and low end products and the difference in experience it would bring.</p>
<p>I hear you. But this is just rumor. We&#8217;ll have to see what the reality is.</p>
<p>$250-$600 = depending on the service plan you buy with it.  Just buying the device = $600.  Buying a plan and the device = $250 for the device&#8230;..sounds familiar *cough*every-smart-phone-ever-made*cough*</p>
<p>The sooner my afternoons can be spent like the kids in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denn%C5%8D_Coil" target="new">Dennou Coil</a>, the happier I&#8217;ll be.</p>
<p>I always think of that when I hear about this product. I so want it to happen.</p>
<p>I believe you misspelled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End">Rainbows End</a>.</p>
<p>Ikaruwa, thanks for linking to that! Most awesome thing I&#8217;ve never heard of!</p>
<p>Not only was that one of the corniest videos I ever saw, but Google has a LONG way to go before they can get things working as fluidly as they are in the video. I see so much potential for screwups, whether it be bad voice recognition, or GPS/compass positioning being weird. Not to mention, selecting things looks extremely difficult.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really glad they&#8217;re working on this, but don&#8217;t set your expectations too high based on this video.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s marketing firm is considering a lawsuit over the video for being too much their style.</p>
<p>Couldn`t have said it better myself =P</p>
<p>If you think that&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s style, you don&#8217;t know Apple, and you don&#8217;t know style.</p>
<p>I think you need to get your sarcasm detector calibrated.</p>
<p>he&#8217;s a barista</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t sarcasm, it was a joke. And he&#8217;s right. Apple doesn&#8217;t do concept videos. It&#8217;s either a product they&#8217;re about to ship, or it&#8217;s not. The only concept video they&#8217;ve ever done was under the pre Steve Jobs regime.</p>
<p>The difference is that Apple has these videos for <strong>products you can actually buy.</strong></p>
<p>I think MS may have a competitor now for &#8216;best tech demo that will never make it to market or be far worse than the video&#8217; award.</p>
<p>The difference is Apple doesn&#8217;t innovate products like this. They play it safe with typical products.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy to innovate with a product that doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Yes, because that&#8217;s actual innovation. Building something that no one else has seen before</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my point, they haven&#8217;t built squat. When that&#8217;s in the shop, we&#8217;ll talk again.</p>
<p>Hate to disappoint ya bud&#8230;  display glasses exist:  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=display+glasses&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#q=display+glasses&hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=J3w&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&prmd=imvnsu&source=univ&tbm=shop&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=aPF8T8G9G6TniAKVgLHHDQ&ved=0CLQBEK0E&bav=on.2" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/search?q=display+glasses&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#q=display+glasses&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=J3w&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=univ&amp;tbm=shop&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aPF8T8G9G6TniAKVgLHHDQ&amp;ved=0CLQBEK0E&amp;bav=on.2</a>,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=94d4cbf27079b3b1&amp;biw=1618&amp;bih=942</p>
<p>  Google&#8217;s involvement here seems to be in the back-end interface that is displayed on those glasses &#8212; not the glasses themselves.  Dollars to Donuts Google will <em>not</em> be selling these.</p>
<p>Eew!  that&#8217;s one ugle URL.. Sorry.  Just Google &#8216;display glasses&#8217;</p>
<p>OR use goo.gl, or the link function in the comments box.</p>
<p>Those are just ones that let you watch movies and videos. Not at all what google is going for.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that sort of what it means to be innovative?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re just working on improving products that do exist, aren&#8217;t you just being iterative?</p>
<p>To be innovative you have to make a <em>product</em>. A <em>video</em> isn&#8217;t innovative, a video is <em>fucking bullshit</em>. When those glasses are in the shops, then I shall laud Google for their innovation &#8211; until then, well&#8230; Microsoft Courier.</p>
<p>Oh, that&#8217;s what you meant by a &#8220;product doesn&#8217;t exist&#8221;.</p>
<p>I thought you meant a product <strong>category</strong> doesn&#8217;t exist. Because what they&#8217;re really doing is designing a product that has never really existed. I think it&#8217;s unfair to be so harsh on them for making a video of what they hope to accomplish when we have no idea how far along in their testing they are. You <em>assume</em> they have nothing but this video, but that&#8217;s probably not true. It&#8217;s possible that all of Google&#8217;s employees are using these everyday to test it out so they can launch it at I/O, but that&#8217;s probably not true either. They&#8217;re probably busy testing and refining prototypes of this device in the lab. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean that it will come out, but it does mean that they&#8217;re trying to invent a whole new category of products, and that&#8217;s what it means to be innovative.</p>
<p>At what point do you call a product innovative? when it&#8217;s an idea in someone&#8217;s head? when they build the first prototype? the first working prototype? When they start testing it? When it launches? or when the first consumer opens the box and turns it on for the first time?</p>
<p>tread softly.  clearly, you&#8217;re dealing with devout &#8220;consumer whore&#8221;.  To say &#8220;To be innovative, you have to make a product&#8221; could be said by someone who is obviously so obseesed with needed to purchase something, he doesnt care about what it actually is ansd what has gone into it.  I&#8217;d reference countless innovators who never made a physical product in their lifetimes: But lets go with the obvious ones:  Albert Einstein, Issac Newton, Plato, Aristotle&#8230;.hell, Lets grab some more modern ones: George Lucas (revolutionized modern Movie and Special Effects industry  and ALL he ever did was make &#8220;bullshit videos&#8221;)&#8230;.I digress</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the bottomline:  the interface is a stepping stone from things that have already been done to something new (the interface and button selecting feels a lot like MS Kinect&#8217;s, eye displays have been made [though, not on an interactive level], and smart phones can do all of that, Google is merely looking at the efforts to pioneer a more ergonomic solution&#8230;and its more than feasible.)  To discount it because it doesnt have a preciously over -priced apple logo on it, or the fact that it doesnt have a release date, does NOT mean it will never come to fruition.  I pre-order games all the time that don&#8217;t have release dates.  Doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll never exist (yeah, a few of them disappear and are never heard about again, but mostly they get to the market floor eventually)</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s style isn&#8217;t to cocktease with bullshit. When they show something off, they are ready to sell it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Apple is a fashion designer.  Lets all be honest, I don&#8217;t care how cool the iPhone/iPad/iWhatever is &#8211; at the end of the day, you&#8217;re paying top price for slick casing and an Apple logo.  Technically speaking, the processing power and capabiltiies are pretty much identical to other possible solutions.</p>
<p>How is this in Apple&#8217;s style?</p>
<p>The voice recognition in Android works really well as long as you don&#8217;t try to talk really fast or use a Non-American accent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only a matter of localization before it works better for everyone.</p>
<p>Ahem, Voice Actions will be getting massive improvements. *cough*Majel/Assistant*cough*</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems to be using Majel throughout the video. You can&#8217;t use half of those voice actions with the current version of Android. This blows Siri away.</p>
<p>Well, Siri on the other hand has the advantage of <em>existing</em>.</p>
<p>you do realize the video is something edited in after effects and has nothing to do with actual glasses, right? They filmed a story, did some voice over work, and made animations on the screen &#8211; it&#8217;s not real. There&#8217;s no software/hardware behind any of that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Google was saying when they were going to implement semantic search within their products. I cannot wait for Google IO!!!</p>
<blockquote>I see so much potential for screwups, whether it be bad voice recognition, or GPS/compass positioning being weird.</blockquote>
<p>yeah umm&#8230;odds are a majority of these functions are going to be made to pair with an android phone over bluetooth. especially for the lower end glasses (the target price is said to be between $250 and $600). That&#8217;s umm, if google is smart about it, but we&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;ve seen them, like microsoft, do a lot of stupid things in the past.</p>
<p>Great post. Nice to read a voice of reason.</p>
<p>Well, they look less annoying than I thought they would. Seriously though, I just don&#8217;t see any point in these.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t? Srs?</p>
<p>Slap an Apple on it and see how fast he gets interested.</p>
<p>Couldnt said it better myself!!</p>
<p>Well, with an apostrophe and the addition of "have," perhaps.</p>
<p>everyone hide grammar police!!!!</p>
<p>Quick flush the grammar, flush the grammar!</p>
<p>I’m trying to hide grammar police, but the cupboard’s too small and my closet’s filled with thought police!</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t be an apple device &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t have a SHIP date&#8230;</p>
<p>So brave!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t.  I could be wrong, but I don&#8217;t see this type of concept as having much mass appeal.  Everyone uses a phone.  Not everyone wears or wants to wear glasses.</p>
<p>In the mid 90s people didn&#8217;t need or use cell phones either. What happened to optimism and innovation? Reminds me of the verge show with degrase Tyson.</p>
<p>I said I could be wrong.  I don&#8217;t see this as having mass appeal though.  Google has a terrible track record of making things normal people actually want.  Search and Gmail are their only real mass appeal hits.  the list of failures is much longer.</p>
<p>There is something to be said for trying and failing, granted.  But Google has demonstrated time and again they are too techie/geek focused and can&#8217;t truly break into mass appeal products.</p>
<p>Android&#8217;s market share would like a word with you.</p>
<p>Maps also would like some time</p>
<p>I would add that to the success list.</p>
<p>Youtube?</p>
<p>Youtube was successful prior to Google buying it.</p>
<p>Google + Youtube = (x)success</p>
<p>I still consider Android to be a failure in specific fronts, but can&#8217;t agree more that Google Maps is an undeniable triumph of technology and service and definitely one of <strong>the</strong> killer features of Android.</p>
<p>And Google has lost money on Android.  just because a lot of people use it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s successful.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Really.  I know it&#8217;s hard to believe, but it&#8217;s true.  Not charging for something and investing billions doesn&#8217;t turn a profit.  It&#8217;s crazy, I know it.</p>
<p>You are willfully ignorant. You know better.</p>
<p>1. They get ad revenue from mobile ads. 2. They get, I believe, $10/device for any Android device with the Google suite of apps (Gmail, Maps, Calendar, etc).</p>
<p>Rough estimates put a revenue figure at about 750,000 X $10 &#8230; <em>per day</em>. And that number is only growing exponentially.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re buying Motorola, which puts the Android effort into the red for now.</p>
<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>And not making a direct profit on something doesn&#8217;t make it not successful. They make plenty off of Ads for mobile and other monetization products.</p>
<p>And you complain when people call you a troll.<br />
&#8220;&#8230;can’t truly break into mass appeal products.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;&#8230;just because a lot of people use it doesn’t mean it’s successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>move the goal posts much.<br />
iDiot.</p>
<p>What did I move?  Those aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive statements.  Yes, lots of people have Android phones.  No, it&#8217;s not a successful business for Google.  Samsung is making a killing though.</p>
<p>Read what I wrote, and try again.</p>
<p>Mass appeal = a lot of people want/have <br />
Android phones like you said &#8220;lots of people have Android phones.&#8221;</p>
<p>unless by mass appeal products you mean products you&#8217;d use in church you are moving the goal posts</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s the investor that defines the threshold of success, not -LD. Mind you, profitable is not same as successful. <br />
For Google&#8217;s stated goals, Android is immensely successful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it? You first say &#8220;can’t truly break into mass appeal products&#8221;, then you claim that they did not succeed?<br />
I&#8217;m pretty sure that Android is in the &#8220;mass appeal products&#8221; category. Whether it&#8217;s profitable or not, is irrelevant to that point.</p>
<p>10 to 1 he doesn&#8217;t reply, or spouts off some nonsense about how he was talking about profits in the first place.</p>
<p>Well look at both sides of the argument:<br />
Google has a whole host of shit that 1/10 geeks use&#8230;.even the android itself (which you are claiming as a massmarket success) is at best = 1/3 mobile smartphone market (with iphone, windows phone, bb et al &#8211; making up the other 2/3) and for most companies (MS and Apple included) selling a phone doesnt mean jack shit.  Hell, most phones are given away.  Google&#8217;s quotient of profit is determined by the phone company selling the plan for the device.  in that regard, that $80/phone/month is divided into the carrier/the software maker (Google/MS/Apple)/hardware provider/misc 3rd parties, etc&#8230;.at the end of the day its enough to keep the chains moving, but its not some rediculous 72 Million-Billion-Bajillion/day.<br />
That being said, who the hell dropped in for specifics.  -LD made some valid points:<br />
1.  Google has a TON of shit that most people dont care about.<br />
2.  Google has much fewer successes with the &#8220;general public&#8221; (granted it has successes, but not every google idea takes off)<br />
3.  And I wouldn&#8217;t exactly call android a &#8220;huge success&#8221;&#8230;I&#8217;d call it google&#8217;s ONLY piece of consumer hardware.</p>
<p>A) Last time I looked at market research companies, Android was firmly the top smartphone OS out there. By a huge margin.<br />
B) Google makes something off each device&#8217;s sale? Thus I knight you &#8211; Sir Uninformed.</p>
<p>1 &#8211; So does any company.<br />
2 &#8211; So does every company<br />
3 &#8211; As I said, given Google&#8217;s goals you can&#8217;t call it not a success. If you define success only as profit, then that is your problem. And you might want to learn chess and checkers, for a bit more perspective on success.</p>
<p>Last time i checked, when I play chess I typically only win when I actually make moves that advance my board position&#8230;If I sacrifice every piece i have, I won&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>A) I said 1/3 of the market.  I never mentioned highest/lowest.  I&#8217;m merely looking at the statiistcal fundamentals.  And speaking of fundamentals, did you know comScore included disposable burner phones in that subscription count?  Fun fact: more people throw away androids than any other smart phone.</p>
<p>B) Really?  If you honestly think Google doesn&#8217;t make a dime for royalties for every picture of that damn android logo (let alone everytime a device that uses it sells), you are gravely mistaken.  They make their royalties from EVERY sale, dont let them fool you.</p>
<p>And I really have no idea why you think google is some &#8220;all-for-the-people&#8221;  company with a mountain of successes at its belt.  Google is the same company that sold its services to China to build an iron-curtain-esque firewall around its networks&#8230;where did half of those profits/payoffs get recorded?  Also, Google hires some of the brightest people it can find, if you honestly dont believe that this includes geomancers of financial and fiscal data, you are also mistaken.  Just like Hollywood can make the most successful movies look terrible on paper to prevent paying share points, Google (and other large companies) manipulate data and statistics ALL the time (if they didn&#8217;t, we wouldnt go through &#8220;wall Street Witch Hunts&#8221;, ENRON, etc&#8230;).  Dont be so quick to assume every stat you read is the &#8220;gospel truth&#8221;.  And certainly dont think that Google is THE authority on Mass Marketing for smart phones&#8230;.they made an operating system.  the people at Samsung, Motorola,  LG, HTC, etc made that operating system work for them.  google didn&#8217;t sell jack shit, apple had locked down their OS to their proprietary hardware, so google released the ONLY viable competition at the time, and other developers made that technology work.  But this device doesnt exactly have that same scenario, so it doesnt even fall in the same type of comparison.</p>
<p>Gmail would also like a word.</p>
<p>I mentioned Gmail.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s douche, but he did mention Gmail.</p>
<p>and Chrome and Android and Maps and News</p>
<blockquote>There is something to be said for trying and failing, granted. But Google has demonstrated time and again they are too techie/geek focused and can’t truly break into mass appeal products.</blockquote>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Chrome shouldn&#8217;t be left out of this, it&#8217;s the number 2 most used browser in the US, and it gains a little bit on IE every day.</p>
<p>The data history is kinda staggering, here&#8217;s the numbers according to Global Stat Counter:</p>
<p><strong>2008</strong>  &#8211;  <strong>2012</strong><br />
IE: 69%  &#8211;  36%<br />
Firefox: 25% &#8211; 25%<br />
Safari: 3% &#8211; 7%<br />
Chrome: 1% &#8211; 30%</p>
<p>Chrome&#8217;s gain has clearly come at the expense of the browser with the highest market share, which tells me that Chrome has real mass market appeal.</p>
<p>Or chrome is deliberately doing things to slide that statistic.  (kind of like microsoft was doing to make bing search look successful)</p>
<p>Hmmm..how do they measure those statistics, i wonder by download, by launch, application time in use?</p>
<p>If its by download &#8211; then by that logic, iTunes would have more &#8220;use&#8221; than the number of computers able to run it actually exist.  Likewise for Google Chrome.  So many applications and pieces of &#8220;freeware&#8221; install the Google toolbar and/or google chrome when installed that the number of people installing and &#8220;using&#8221; it isnt even close to that.  And that would explain the drastic drop in IE use &#8211; since almost every PC comes with IE already installed.</p>
<p>Application launching is just a bad statistic base regardless of the appliation, since ie is the default on ANY new PC and almost EVERY demo PC in stores.  Google chrome infects the registry of windows 7 and windows xp to be recognized as the default internet browser and is still called AFTER the program is uninstalled until a registry setting is manually changed/removed. (dont believe me, uninstall it and then try to open a hyperlink in openoffice or MS word)  And dont even get me started on how firefox re-launches itself a million times for every single plugin update.</p>
<p>If its measured by time the window is open/connected &#8211; well, most browsers run in the background even when they arent open, so that statistic is pretty faulty at best.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the only accurate way to measure the real use/success of internet application is to see how many people give a damn when it breaks.  Thats how you really know how many people want to/and are actually using it. ;o)</p>
<p>I think they measure it by monitoring which browser people use when visiting certain websites. I&#8217;m not sure how many websites they monitor, but it could be hundreds or thousands. It&#8217;s probably more than 10 and less than a million.</p>
<p>Basically, it&#8217;s a measure of the number of people who use each browser to visit a website. and it&#8217;s from a third party, not Google or Microsoft.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/" target="new">link</a></p>
<p>Wow. i&#8217;m sure that statistic hasn&#8217;t been jack-hammered or skewed in anyway by a bot-net or two.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned a cell phone continuously since the mid 90s&#8230; and so have most of the people I know.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t even like to wear 3d glasses in their own <em>homes</em> I can almost guarantee that the first generation of these glasses will fail to gain traction in the consumer market outside of certain professional circuits (security, finance, etc.) As for cell phones, well, it&#8217;s been 20 years since the 90s and people already had phones in their homes at the time.</p>
<p>The same was said for cellphones, tablets, etc</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m pretty sure everybody has always understood the benefit of the cell phone. I remember when they were briefcase-sized and while few people were interested in that form-factor (or price), everybody still thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>See: Dick Tracy&#8217;s watch, c.1940&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p>What if they put this on some sunglasses? The screen portion would probably have to go inside the lens. To the passerby they could just look like normal sunglasses.</p>
<p>Although, the sunglasses only work in certain weather and during the day&#8230;</p>
<p>if they make it so it turns to sun glasses in the sun, and clear glasses in your home, that would work.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s called transition lenses.</p>
<p><img src="http://dague.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/welcome-to-the-world-of-tomorrow.jpeg" /></p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t know how these devices work, even after seeing the video. I want to try on a pair before I judge this device</p>
<p>This is WILD!</p>
<p>I just really want to try these, they look a freakishly good amount of fun.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the great thing about concepts. They all look cool and fun as hell. But at the end of the day, they&#8217;re just concepts.</p>
<p>I would love to see Google or another powerful company push augmented reality in this direction. But releasing a video doesn&#8217;t do a damn thing. (Not criticizing Google for releasing it, I am criticizing those who think a concept video is innovation)</p>
<p>I for one would like to take her on to a fancy dinner.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re lame and lonely. We get it.</p>
<p>Or, maybe he just has a sense of humor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so afraid this is Google over promising.  I&#8217;m not sure I want to be connected in this way but if Google could pull it off technically it would mean a HUGE leap in mobile computing.  Which makes me skeptical that Google can pull something like this off in the near future.</p>
<p>I believe in Larry Page.</p>
<p>They should have posted this on April Fools 2012. After that they should have said &#8220;Yeah&#8230;. we&#8217;re serious, this shit is real!&#8221;</p>
<p>Im going to watch porn whenever I want YEAAAAAA</p>
<p>It was going to happen at some point.</p>
<p>Inevitable. Sorry.</p>
<p>My god this looks amazing, but will they fit over my glasses?! Time for contacts!</p>
<p>See my comment above :)</p>
<p>Release date: Q4 2016.</p>
<p>Rumored to release later this year in time for Christmas, actually. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/303647/20120223/google-goggles-glasses-heads-up-display-hud.htm" target="new">Here&#8217;s</a> one source.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;ll be ad supported.  So when you get rejected by a girl at a bar an ad for match.com will appear.</p>
<p>+1 This</p>
<p>As someone who wears glasses, those solid wire type nose pieces are incredibly uncomfortable. Otherwise, this is weirdly awesome, if a bit unnecessary.</p>

<p>While this is a cool concept, and we&#8217;ve heard rumors about it for a while, the fact that they are only showing a theoretical device and nothing concrete is pretty disconcerting.  They should have waited until they had something real to show.</p>
<p>Whoops, meant &#8220;disappointing&#8221; not  &#8220;disconcerting&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little bit of both.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rumored to come out this year. They may have held off showing even a concept until now to keep competitors from scooping them. They could easily show concept now, then turn around and have the real deal at I/O.</p>
<p>Or they could shut up and ship.</p>
<p>Nobody really does that anymore. Even Apple hasn&#8217;t done the &#8217;And you can buy one now&quot; thing in a while.</p>
<p>Yeah, they have and they do.</p>
<p>Everything that ground-breaking they had a good 3month lead time.</p>
<p>But an announced ship date.</p>
<p>Still, nothing this ground breaking.</p>
<p>I have to say that this is totally mad, while iPhone and iPad were excellent but grounded products.</p>
<p>iPone &amp; iPad exist.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone</strong> even</p>
<p>Name the last &#8220;buy now&#8221; release.</p>
<p>iPad 3, they gave an exact ship date.  I believe it was 1 week (maybe 2).</p>
<p>You still failed. &#8220;I believe it was 1 week (maybe 2).&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why a date is needed, it&#8217;s not like Page got on stage and demoed it. It&#8217;s a &#8216;hey look at what we&#8217;re working on&#8217; video.</p>
<p>Well, if you prefer to nitpick down to the second, no, Apple has never a &#8220;buy now&#8221; product, ever.</p>
<p>Without a date, it&#8217;s vaporware.  It&#8217;s the Courier.  All bark, no bite.  People can do amazing things in concept videos.  Making real products and really shipping is hard work.</p>
<p>Pretty sure they&#8217;ve done at least one MacBook that way, available that day. I have absolutely no idea if iPods ever have because I&#8217;ve had no interest in one, ever,.</p>
<p>Actually, they have done for some Macs when they have shown them off in the morning at their campus. &#8220;Available today.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading several of your posts, and by that logic, would you also argue that the iPhone5 does not exist or that Apple is failing to innovate in it&#8217;s design? No, we all know the iPhone5 most certainly exists.</p>
<p>As for these glasses; they may or may not exist. Simply nobody knows. It is an interesting idea that would have far reaching implications if it hit the consumer market properly. That said, I agree that by showing this video they are not &#8216;innovating&#8217;. However the idea itself is innovation in technology and will inspire more tech like it in one way or another.</p>
<p>I heavily doubt that we will see this product by the end of 2012 or even Q3 2013.</p>
<p>A date is important because it suggests that the product exists and does infact do all the things being claimed. I mean look at the courier a lot of things in that demo had never been done and 2 years later still have not been done.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also rumored not to come out this year. Rumors are just rumors. They&#8217;re for idiots to believe and obsess over.</p>
<p>I believe this is the future no doubt.</p>

<p>Blue Glass?</p>
<p><img src="http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/breaking-bad-s4-lab.jpg" /></p>
<p>Forget blue glass</p>
<p>This is epic because it looks like they are looking up at Ross</p>
<p>XD</p>
<p>Does it mean everyone would wear glasses ? And im not sure about it necessity, you can just get out the phone in your pocket and do the same thing.</p>
<p>The idea is for these to replace your phone. Eventually.</p>
<p>And in the short term provide some information without needed to pull the phone out.</p>
<p>Say, caller-id, text notification. You could Shazam something.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so, touch input is way more natural than eye-pointing, and voice input is just useful for a relatively small set of actions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming the people calling these pointless or unnecessary don&#8217;t own smartphones.</p>
<p>I can be cool like Garrus.</p>
<p>(Though the idea of wearing a device that allows Google to monitor everything I ever do? Brrrr.)</p>
<p>Now I can do calibrations in real life!</p>
<p>Now I just need an omni-tool and I&#8217;m set for the Reaper invasion</p>
<p>WHAT?!!! I want one NOW!</p>
<p>In 10 years, all the chips in this thing will be small enough to embed in contact lenses. Just saying. And yes, I already bought the iContactLens.com domain</p>
<p>More than likely they&#8217;d just be called iLens, just saying.</p>
<p>iEye?</p>
<p>eyePhone</p>
<p>People thought that bluetooth headsets were going to be cool too.</p>
<p>this is the exact same thought i had when i saw this.  they might be a good tool for people who need them, but i gotta feeling they&#8217;ll mostly be adopted by that douchebag in the bar.  i hope they add a blinking blue light to it.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not?</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; this April Fools gag is a few days late.</p>
<p>Earth Two !</p>
<p>ive waited so long for this.</p>
<p>Way Cool! And it didn&#8217;t come from Apple!</p>
<p>Except, one of the guys that was developing AR glasses for Apple was headhunted by Google just a few months ago.  So, Apple&#8217;s been working on them for awhile, Google steals their engineers, puts out a video, and shazam! Google steals another from Apple&#8230;</p>
<p>Life 2.0</p>
<p>Will I have to cut down my lenses for this? Like a MicroSIM?. It better have Facebook and Twitter integration, I don&#8217;t see this taking off without any third party support ie apps.</p>
<p>Why on earth would you want third party apps for this. It&#8217;s supposed to be a thing for augmented reality. Navigation, texting/calling, etc.</p>
<p>this is beyond outrageously awesome. Early adopter over here!!!</p>
<p>Early adopter of what? As in, what product (name) are you adopting? See the flaw in your thinking?</p>
<p>Me too!</p>
<p>No ones wearing these sorry. Hook up with Warby Parker or something and get some hipster going!</p>

<p>No cause then you can&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>wake up in the morning &#8230;..can&#8217;t see anything &#8230;. put them on&#8230;. [ ALL SYSTEMS READY ]</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of this if you have a smartphone?</p>
<p><strong>le sigh</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely integrated with your smartphone.</p>
<p>OK. So, why don&#8217;t I just look at my smartphone screen?</p>
<p>Are you trolling or asking a serious question? I can&#8217;t tell if srs.</p>
<p>I already posted some examples that would be useful where you wouldn&#8217;t even want the whole phone screen.</p>
<p>Because unlike a smartphone, this concept has the potential to be always on and right in front of your view. I.E., as a concept it may even be better than a smartphone. As a concept it&#8217;s augmented reality without having to pull a smartphone out of your pocket, unlock the screen, open an app, hold up your smartphone, and use it.</p>
<p><strong>Of course it&#8217;s just a concept.</strong></p>
<p>Wearing glasses made by an advertising company so that they can surveil you 24/7 and see what you buy to show you more targeted ads.</p>
<p>Who wouldn&#8217;t love that?</p>
<p>Yes, because monitoring everything you do in real life is legal and practical. Go back to your cave, troll.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t it be legal in the beginning? New devices, new laws, as always. There&#8217;s no law that I heard of preventing this concept device.</p>
<p>As long as their is a benefit the consumer can get out of such a device, then targeted Ads are perfectly acceptable. Complaining about Ads is pointless.</p>
<p>It is a bit scary. At least the camera can&#8217;t determine exactly what you&#8217;re looking at, just a wide view in the direction you&#8217;re looking.</p>
<p>I for one will not be rocking the Vegeta steez. I think Google has underestimated how important not looking bad is to people. Geeks won&#8217;t care, but people&#8230;.</p>
<p>And back to reality&#8230;<br />
<img src="http://a.yfrog.com/img741/9720/c4duh.jpg" /></p>
<p>Heard you liked sunglasses, so put some sunglasses in your&#8230;</p>
<p>This reminds me of Starship Troopers<br />
&#8220;Become a citizen to get these sunglasses&#8230;.Would you like to know more?&#8221;<br />
&#8230;.or something</p>
<p>Ducky</p>
<p>lmao</p>
<p>haha. Should be ads of an umbrella and light jacket kinda stuff</p>
<p>You know what else had cool demo videos? Wave. Also, where were the ads?</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll be beamed straight into your brain</p>
<p>For a second there, I thought of the German film &#8216;Die&#8217; Welle first &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Welle" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Welle</a></p>
<p>my jaw dropped a bit when i saw the vid&#8230; think of the endless possibilities! Reminds me of when bluetooth headsets came out, how weird they were at first, now its normal to see people with em. The singularity is coming!</p>
<p>Yet everyone hates people with bluetooth headsets</p>
<p>Is it just the sight of them, or is it people talking loudly that people hate?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the talking to yourself in public thing that  never caught on.</p>
<p>Nerdgasm! That is all&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Add to my circles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riiiiiight.</p>
<p>Most likely will have APIs for other social services to use.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t that constitute prior art?</p>
<p>Schmidt happens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting for a decent implementation of augmented reality since I was 8. (I&#8217;m 20 now) This makes me happy!!!</p>
<p>This is really amazing. Though it would be a really cool consumer product, we all know it&#8217;s just going to end up blasting ads right at our eyeballs. The consumer applications I hope will go much much farther than that. But let&#8217;s think about other, more serious applications that something like this could help reinvent. Here are some ideas:</p>
<p>Law enforcement<br />
Medicine via remote diagnosis/second opinions<br />
Emergency response</p>
<p>The ability to &#8220;share what you see&#8221; is highly useful&#8230; Any other ideas?</p>
<p>a future world full of people talking a to him self and theirs phones, now i don&#8217;t look so crazy talking to my wallet yes!!</p>
<p>This is unbelievably, wonderfully awesome. I&#8217;ve been waiting for augmented reality for so long, and Google is my favorite company, so they&#8217;re perfect.<br />
However, I&#8217;m not liking the voice control aspect. Can&#8217;t they do some sort of blink control? Or use your Android phone as a remote?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they could do both.</p>
<p>I personally would advocate for &quot; a pair of infrared glasses that pick up twitches in (your) cheek&quot;, a la Stephen Hawking /s</p>
<p>Ideally, though, the &#8220;iBrain&#8221; concept of using the brainwaves would eventually be small enough to put into the glasses, so you could control it with your thoughts.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>I knew this was coming. Soon they&#8217;re be on our windows and our windshields, too.</p>
<p>on your windshield, mirror, windows, table, wall &#8211; will happen before this.</p>
<p>Time for Lasik Surgery!!!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any of their models can pull it off as well as Garrus from ME<br />
<img src="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100323054857/masseffect/images/3/36/Garrus_Character_Shot.png" /></p>
<p>This was the first thing that popped into my head when I saw this story.</p>
<p>So these glasses will help with my calibrations?</p>
<p>I think this is the inevitable future, whether we think it&#8217;s necessary or not.  People are already willing to look like dorks either (a) staring at their smartphone all day long, or (b) wearing bluetooth headseats.  This is not much of a stretch from that.</p>
<p>I should say, though, that the video illustrates more heads-up-display applications than actual augmented reality.  It&#8217;s quite conservative in that regard.</p>
<p>Excellent point that these are mostly heads-up display notifications, not augmented reality.</p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re doing a video call with someone they see your eye?</p>
<p>Lol good point.</p>
<p>Solution? Put a mini black hole inside the glasses to bend the light from you face into the lense, PROBLEM SOLVED! Figured that was nerdie enough and explanation for these things.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>This is so cool! If this is an extension of Android then it would make it a killer feature.</p>

<p>OMG I forgot about this film. Thank you.</p>
<p>WOW, how could you forget about They Live?</p>
<p><img src="http://annyas.com/htdocs/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/they-live-15.jpg" /></p>
<p>What movie is this? Looks interesting.</p>
<p>They Live</p>
<p>A drifter discovers a pair of sunglasses that allow him to wake up to the fact that aliens have taken over the Earth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/</a></p>
<p>the film echoed contemporary fears of a declining economy, within a culture of greed and conspicuous consumption common among Americans. In They Live, the ruling class within the moneyed elite are in fact aliens managing human social affairs through the use of a signal on top of the TV broadcast that is concealing their appearance and subliminal messages in mass media.</p>
<p>Dude, sell it properly, it&#8217;s got Rowdy Roddy Piper in it and the famous line.</p>
<p>&#8217;I&#8217;m here to kick ass and chew gum and I&#8217;m all out of gum&#8217;.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.cavemancircus.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2011/may/they_live.jpg" /></p>
<p>More importantly, the fight between Jimmy and Timmy in the South Park episode &#8220;Cripple Fight&#8221; was copied more or less  shot for shot from this movie.</p>
<p>Haha yes it was.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most epic movies of all times, for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>I would rock the sh*t out of these shades. Sign me up Google!</p>
<p>Helllz yea I&#8217;d rock these. Although I just can&#8217;t help but think the black eyed peas would be all over these as soon as possible. Just seems to fit.</p>
<p>But, to really be useful, something like this would need a battery big enough to last around 16 hours, or else be wired to an external battery/solar backpack/wind turbine hat/pocket-sized Mr.Fusion, right? After all, the mini projector, sensors, processor and WiFi/cellular radios would be working at all times.<br />
But what do I know, maybe they already have all of this solved. I really want this thing to be real.</p>
<p>I doubt it has radios and probably very minimal processing. I see it blue-toothing to your android.</p>
<p>okay, no radios but blue-tooth i mean*</p>
<p>Cool, this will give Bibio a nice little bumb he deserves.</p>
<p>I love Bibio</p>
<p>I see Molly&#8217;s Mom in the first picture. Makes me feel nostalgic somehow. Totally strange.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the new eyePhone, you can watch, listen, ignore your friends,  stalk your ex, download porno on a crowded bus, even check your e-mail while getting hit by a train. All with the new eyePhone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so disappointed no one has created a David Caruso meme of this yet.</p>
<p>Sigh.  Looks like it has amazing potential, but let&#8217;s be real here.  It&#8217;ll require pretty large advances in battery tech, interface design, wireless connectivity, etc, so it ain&#8217;t gonna happen this year. And remember that Google is an advertising company at heart, so there&#8217;s going to have to be a way to monetize this with ads, either by displaying them to you directly, or selling your whereabouts, activities, etc to advertisers.  Either one sounds awful.</p>
<p>Yes!!!!!! Now I can get an accurate reading on my enemy&#8217;s power level and find the last 3 dragonballs!!!!!!!!</p>
<p><img src="http://images.wikia.com/dragonball/images/5/55/DragonballZ-Episode001ws_89.jpg" /></p>
<p>&#8230;OVER 9000?! Sorry, had to do it.</p>
<p>Well played sir.</p>
<p>Google has been a bad boy lately.. but his washes away all their sins</p>
<p>I keep throwing my wallet at the screen but nothing&#8217;s happening!</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s read Daemon by Daniel Suarez knows this could go poorly for humanity.  Well, I guess only if Google becomes possessed by by malevolent spirit of some genius.</p>
<p><img src="http://thegadgets.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/steve_jobs_01.jpg" /></p>
<p>So you&#8217;re saying he could possess Google.</p>
<p>I think you may have missed the point of Daemon and Freedom&#8482;. The Daemon and its effects on the world may have been bad for the few plutocrats, but it was good for humanity.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to see the first geek idiot to wear these in public and walk into a tree.</p>
<p>So how do these work exactly? Most peoples eyes can&#8217;t focus on something 1 cm in front of them. Is the image projected onto your retina?</p>
<p>Secondly, he talks normally to his glasses, but how do his glasses know when he is referring to them? And how do they know when it is him speaking? Does he shift his eyes a certain way or something?</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed as if looking up or down might have been significant.</p>
<p>In practical use I&#8217;d say there would be a button on it to press when you want it to recognize your voice.</p>
<p>But you raised a point I was skim reading to see if it was worth me making a reply here about. I don&#8217;t see how this technology would actually work because humans, as far as I know, can&#8217;t focus on anything that close to their eyes&#8230; Just try holding your smartphone a cm away from your eye and see how you can&#8217;t focus on it.</p>
<p>Projecting it onto the retina or some other technology is a possibility though I guess, and also if this is for real then I&#8217;m thinking Google must have worked out how to do it or this is a failed concept right from the get-go.</p>
<p>Take allllllllllllllllllll myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy moneyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy</p>
<p>Oh. Another theoretical &#8220;look at the future&#8221; video from a technology company. No product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna go watch an actual science fiction film while you guys actually come up with something to ship.</p>
<p>they release these videos so when another company develops the technology people will say they stole it from google.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand how the voice commands will work.. Are they always going to be listening?</p>
<p>Also, i LOL&#8217;d at &#8220;Good to see you&#8221; &#8220;thanks man&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seems like the most obvious route is for this to connect to your Android phone via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>That way, the glasses only contain a microphone, Bluetooth transceiver, battery, and display.</p>
<p>Your phone stays in your pocket, with the display OFF.</p>
<p>Pretty neat.</p>
<p>Apple, this is a real Retina Display.</p>
<p>This is also how you do real Siri, not that half-baked crap of a chatbot</p>
<p>Oh, so Apple was supposed to do a concept video instead of ship an actual product. I see.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your excuse going to be later this year, when they actually ship? Are you going to complain about the build materials?</p>
<p>Concept videos tend to be cooler than shipping products.</p>
<p>awesome</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still unclear about the control mechanism.</p>
<p>I get the instances when he&#8217;s using voice control. That&#8217;s already available now with Bluetooth headsets now but what about all the other interactions? It&#8217;d be a fail if you had to look down at your phone to control it. It&#8217;d defeat the entire purpose of having an augmented reality HUD.</p>
<p>It tracks his eyes Steven hacking style I would say.</p>
<p>heh heh. Hawking. nice slip there though.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will see more at I/O</p>
<p>YOU get a glasses! You get a GLASSES! EVERABODA gets a GLASSES!</p>
<p>My love for Google goes on!</p>
<p>My best guess is that this will be a companion to Google Assistant (Majel), and the GAssitant/Majel app will run on your phone and then switch into glasses mode when you connect these via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>I want to use these now!</p>
<p>This sounds way too cool in theory, but I doubt this would be that great in execution. Plus, I will NEVER EVER say &#8220;Add to my Circle&#8221; in public. If this could integrate with Twitter or FB, then I&#8217;m extremely interested.<br />
Anyways, in the video it shows a video call, but how does the camera get your whole face? That would mean there&#8217;s a giant camera pointing at your face. Wearing these would be like the Truman Show, except 1) you know definitely know you&#8217;re being filmed 2) you aren&#8217;t Jim Carey</p>
<p>In the video, the video call showed <strong>her</strong> face, not his. I assumed there was a camera on the glasses and she was seeing him play the ukelele and then seeing the sunset. I would guess that if you wanted the other person to see your face, you&#8217;d have to hold up your phone&#8230;or hold the glasses out and point them at yourself.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it also showed &#8220;View Mode: ON&#8221; and she was amazed by the sunset. Maybe the call was only voice until he initiated the video? Questions&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://i219.photobucket.com/albums/cc159/eternaltreasure/1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I never asked for this.</p>
<p>I foresee two outcomes:<br />
1. Increase in volume of hilarious youtube videos (Oh shit, my augmented glasses just recorded that)<br />
2. Instant rise in augmented porn-related apps.  &#8220;Turn your wife/gf into your favorite alien, pornstar, or celebrity!&#8221; <br />
But I&#8217;m only getting them if I can get item, sword, heart, magic, and rupee counters to display in the top of my HUD, Zelda style.</p>
<p>The human revolution is beginning to take shape&#8230;</p>
<p>This is exactly what I dreamed Microsoft would do&#8230;.</p>
<p>Your dreams were misplaced. Their idea of innovation is releasing a new version of Office with a slightly more annoying interface element.</p>
<p>7-10 years away at least. the processing power and battery life will be there in 5 years as well as connectivity (lte advanced is capable of this) and voice recognition will be there in 5 years but the display technology is the catch. What kind of technology is this?</p>
<p>where are those numbers coming from?<br />
Voice tech is already close to that point (Windows Phone 7.5, iPhone 5, Kinect, Wii Speak, etc&#8230;)<br />
Network connectivity, has a few years before ist seemless, but I imigine that something like this could perform (with some small bit of lag/refresh) in today&#8217;s environment.<br />
The optical technology is probably a smaller version of a focal tracking lens (they&#8217;ve been using these at optomologists for years now) (its that frame you lean your head into and it focusses the blury dot for you.  (this could easily be made smaller with today&#8217;s technology since I&#8217;ve using the same gargantuan piece of junk at my eye doctor&#8217;s place since I had a 486/66.)<br />
Battery life?  Well that depends on how they&#8217;ve allocated the battery be spent.  Using kinetic recharging and possibly some solar charging &#8211; I could see something like this operating on netowrk conditions for a good 6 hours without need for a recharge.  If they&#8217;re smart and use a physical sensor to wake/sleep the device when you aren&#8217;t moving, it could last up to 10 hours.  not a FULL day, but who wants to wear this thing 24/7?  Hell, I can only take about 8-10 hours of my prescription glasses.</p>
<p>How would the video calling work? No camera can capture your full face that close up. and taking a picture and video  how can glasses get a full screen shot of you? Solar charging on a pair of glasses.. good luck. WP voice integration is no where near this, and neither is wii speak. Kinect and Siri are getting closer but still lack. If it were to happen it would have to use bluetooth 4.0 to wirelessly stream video to the glasses. realistically the glasses would have to be connected to a phone wirelessly for it to be possible in the next couple of years. as a stand alone im sticking with at least 5-7 years</p>
<p>Well &#8211; i never said face-face video chat was really feasible with that setup &#8211; have to be an extedning camera piece (or the super sci-fi idea that you just upload a picture and it animates your facial features to match your speech)   But a small solar skin on the frame and eye piece would be more than feasible &#8211; just not much return with solar power&#8230;it could probably only provide a cost-prohibitive extent on battery life &#8211; not replace it&#8230;.probably same with kinetic energy)  But think about your current cell phone &#8211; the only 2 reasons any smart phone is as big and battery intensive as it is &#8211; is because of the screen apparatus and touchpad/keyboard &#8211; the two most power intesive functions on any smart phone.  Take away the screen, superhuman speakers, and touchpad and you&#8217;ve extended any phone&#8217;s battery life by probably at least 200%.  Also, take those away and the processors, battery and circuitry could easily be rearranged into glasses with an augment piece (granted we&#8217;re not exactly talking &#8220;wire-thin&#8221; frames) with today&#8217;s technology.  WP voice integration is surprisingly accurate and has been commercially available for over a year.  Meaning any technology put into this is beyond feasible &#8211; though admittedly not quite as slick as advertised.  (I imigine I&#8217;d be  saying &#8220;no&#8221; to my glasses a lot)</p>
<p>Note: i only listed Wii Speak as an example of existing technology &#8211; i never said it was any good.</p>
<p>Google, I&#8217;ll be your guinea pig1!!!!</p>
<p>This is such a poor advertisement for augmented reality. It does it no more good than the gimmicky browsers that some people applaude today. With well backed wastes of time like this then AR has a tough future to make it to the mainstream.</p>
<p>Its the first step you dumb ass!!!! Just like Apple made the multi touch interfaces popular.</p>
<p>First step to what exactly?</p>
<p>Somehow you seem to think that Google are going to amke AR popular.</p>
<p>and if we are going to debate this then lets try and do it with a little respect</p>
<p>Quick question&#8230;.just what do you think AR is meant to do (i mean besides show my current hit points, amount of charisma, and current active quest)?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to be rude, but beyond the gimicky facet of making a smart-phone type of eye piece, what do you think AR is meant for?  And lets be honest &#8211; did Apple really think of everything the iPod and iPhone brought to the table?  Not a chance.  they just enabled the user community by prioviding a hardware baseline to build from.  Same thing with this.  it wont be true AR, until the user community gets a hold of it and starts taking it in directions Google never imagined. (Like binding the retinal tracker to a motorized tripod for a sniper rifle, in true garrus style)</p>
<p>Great stuff and about the only chance of taking market share away from Apple. Kudos Google.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t aware Apple had market share in the Augmented Reality market.</p>
<p>If you were talking about mobile OSs, they&#8217;re already doubling up Apple in that market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so glad to see Google showing us something groundbreaking. I can&#8217;t wait.  Goodbye Siri, nice knowing ya&#8230;.</p>
<p>If this is released this year, it will make Google TV look like the most solid product release in history. This is still in pre-alpha stages.</p>
<p>It says right in the article that they plan to release it this year. And you have no idea at what stage of development it&#8217;s in right now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a concept. Like Courier was a concept.</p>
<p>Calm down.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&biw=1280&bih=641&tbm=isch&tbnid=lWrfVGV-gmSsJM:&imgrefurl=http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Scouter&docid=7m9iV4Bdnb2Q2M&imgurl=http://images.wikia.com/dragonball/images/5/55/DragonballZ-Episode001ws_89.jpg&w=800&h=450&ei=Pbx8T7nWD-XciQLFrqjnDQ&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=156&vpy=162&dur=5458&hovh=168&hovw=300&tx=162&ty=99&sig=103659439256517613708&page=1&tbnh=96&tbnw=171&start=0&ndsp=18&ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:68" /></p>
<p>Only thing is they need Oakley on board for the product choice of blades!!</p>
<p>I see that the camera is placed around the right eye. I hope they come in a left-eyed version (my preference for composing photos). Anyway, these seem really cool!</p>
<p>Good point. People have &#8220;dominant eyes&#8221;, and mine happens to be my left even though I&#8217;m right handed.</p>
<p>Get back at me when it&#8217;s released and not a Microsoft styled concept video. Anyone can do a concept video.</p>
<p>Holo-Bands!!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.aliencoders.com/sites/default/files/3/google_glasses-766928.jpg" /> This is you in a few years</p>
<p>This better have a retina display!</p>
<p>This video pissed me off for some reason.</p>
<p>The way the guy talks makes me cringe.</p>
<p>What a terrible sell &#8212; made me want the glasses LESS.</p>
<p>My version of the day would have gone:<br />
- Walk to the bookstore and browse around in peace. My friend is either there or he isn&#8217;t.<br />
- Grab a cup of coffee on the way out.<br />
- Climb to the roof to catch the cool sunset (optional)<br />
- Go home to my lovely wife and tell her in person that I love her.  <br />
- Play her an awful song on my stupid ukulele (definitely not)<br />
- Open TicketMaster in my web browser &#8211; realize that TicketMaster is awful, and I really didn&#8217;t want to see Monsieur Shitster. Close tab and resume my life.</p>
<p>Basically the same day, without check-ins, chimes, notifications, and other superfluous grasps for my attention that seek to give the illusion of productivity.</p>
<p>I love many Google products, just not this one.</p>
<p>Agreed. Now that &#8220;extra&#8221; 90% of the brain we were looking for isn&#8217;t necessary. As much as I love tech, this seems to be a step backwards in evolution. Are you really that handicapped and unable to manage your own life that you must shape your reality into the virtual? So this is yet another disillusioned niche for the last of the population that didn&#8217;t get scooped up by  Sims 3&#8230;. I guess if there is medication for personality/mood disorders and ADHD, geeks need to have an out as well.</p>
<p>Cool story bro. Glad you spent the time here to tell us just how much you don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, I think they may have misrepresented a current day in someone&#8217;s life.  More than likely this is what would have happened:<br />
 - Wake up.  Watch TV through AR while making craptastic breakfast.<br />
 - After breakfast, user searches for &#8220;porn&#8221;.  Screenshows &#8220;censored&#8221;.<br />
 - User goes to bookstore, starts playing Angry birds or something equally gay on AR device and doesnt read a single book.<br />
 - User grabs a cup of coffee, ignores the &#8220;check-in&#8221; BS that comes up<br />
 - User searcehs porn again.<br />
 - User uses mapquest to find a pharmacy after bad cup of coffee.<br />
 - User gets mugged.  AR device doesnt call for help because &#8220;911&#8221;, &#8220;Police&#8221;, &#8220;Help&#8221;, and &#8220;Stop beating the shit out of me&#8221; are all not found in his contact list.<br />
 - Person mugging him used an AR device to see the user was carrying cash on him.<br />
 - User goes to hospital.  aside from mugging wounds, AR device has given him brain cancer.</p>
<p>Q: At some point the smartphone market will be saturated and then how will Google make more money from ads?</p>
<p>A: By strapping the phone to your eye. Try ignoring our ads now!</p>
<p>Excellent point. How about DoubleClick brain implants. Not only serving ads directly into your brain, but they can track your thoughts too.</p>
<p>Is this Phase One or Two of Google&#8217;s plan to make the rest of the Western Hemisphere as Aspergian as them?</p>
<p>If you know anything about getting around New York, you&#8217;d see that this is stupid as hell.</p>
<p>Anyone know what brand of Jacket that guy was wearing?</p>
<p>Keep dreaming Google! Your dreams are so beautiful&#8230;</p>
<p>Nappa: Vegeta, what does the scouter say about his power level? <br />
Vegeta: It&#8217;s over NINE THOUSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND!</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t decide what is more fanciful&#8230; the idea that the technology to drive this will be available in the near future, or the idea that Google believe anyone will still be on Google+ in the future!</p>
<p>Boom tish!</p>
<p>I kid! I kid! :D</p>
<p>HAHAHAHHA</p>
<p>This is soooo Ghost In The Shell. :)</p>
<p>Just what I&#8217;ve always wanted. Something to obscure my vision just at the moment of pouring boiling water, descending the subway stairs, and crossing a busy street.</p>
<p>I need glasses anyways. Why not eh?</p>
<p>LOL, they should&#8217;ve released this video on April 1st :)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know where to begin. It&#8217;s so awesome and yet so scary at the same time. The future will be a crazy place.</p>
<p>Especially with a bunch of idiots wandering around not looking where they are going.</p>
<p>finally the era of dragon ball has arrived</p>
<p>This is amazing, cant wait for the day this can come in contact lenses!</p>
<p>I bet a number of people will be run over by cars because they&#8217;re so distracted by the overlay.</p>
<p>Do you think anybody would actually wear google 3D glasses in public? Maybe with their Klingon uniform. lol</p>
<p>Do you think anybody would actually carry around tablets in public? Because they do. Welcome to the 21st century.</p>
<p>If Apple don&#8217;t ultimately bring out a competitive product called iGlasses then they will have missed a trick.</p>
<p>Sad that the glasses didn&#8217;t correct his pronunciation of Monsieur</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not understanding how anything in the UI is being manipulated. Unless the glasses can read minds, I&#8217;m not sure the video is giving us a great depiction of what to expect.</p>
<p>Ha<br />
Looks like he didn&#8217;t want his picture taken</p>
<p>He&#8217;s so cool</p>
<p>He really is.</p>
<p>I definitely felt &#8216;coolness&#8217; coming form him. Especially when he was saying &#8220;were just gonna get over here real quick&#8221; and walked slower than even the most casual of hedgehogs.</p>
<p>Quick doesn&#8217;t mean in a hurry, for the cool folk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s his beard. Beard &gt; no beard.</p>
<p>So what can this thing do more than just take 3sec long video, a picture and look nerdy?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it supposed to be a whole smartphone?</p>
<p>I thought it was an extension of an existing smartphone, essentially a fancy Bluetooth headset of sorts or something.</p>
<p>yea itd be cool if it didnt need a fast CPU and you could connect it wirelessly to your phone and your phone did all the hard work</p>
<p>It makes the most sense&#8230; You could then use the phone to control all of the settings for it, download apps that make use it, etc.</p>
<p>It also means it wouldn&#8217;t be too expensive if/when a consumer version is to be released, as it&#8217;s not a &#8220;smart&#8221; device itself, just an accessory.</p>
<p>It would be nice if it at least could do some of the very elimentary things as shown in that one video. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4</a></p>
<p>Even if it were just projecting things you receive like a text message,..</p>
<p>It just seems like a dumb helmet cam right now. I&#8217;m very disappointed in what they&#8217;ve shown thus far.  All it seems to be good for thus far is making you look like a giant nerd that wants to get beaten up. A pocket protector is much cheaper.</p>
<p>I suppose it will be like a Pebble but with some AR stuff.</p>
<p>Remember that live streamed skydive they did yesterday?  There is that.  It can record or stream video for a good long while amongst other things.</p>
<p>have you not seen the project glass video? thats what its meant to be able to do when its finished.</p>
<p>You can assimilate people and it can emit a red laser.  Oh, you get a cool name too&#8230; like Locutus.</p>
<p>What does this &#8220;Wright Flyer&#8221; do more than skim slightly above the ground for just 17 seconds and look difficult to use.</p>
<p>Not saying its as revolutionary at all, but prototypes can lead to some cool things in surprisingly short periods of time. /analogy</p>
<p>Its supposed to be able to do much of what a cell can do, but its kinda hard to show off a holographic display on video, and more likely most of the UI is probably not ready yet to show off.</p>
<p>Deal with it.</p>
<p>QUICK! Someone GIF that!</p>

<p>Oh this was from I/O day two<br />
Totally forgot about the second day</p>
<p>I hope a Steampunk version is in the works. It would fit this tech perfectly!</p>
<p>Snap-on shades! Whoa!</p>
<p>This changes everything.</p>
<p>Google uses an airship over San Francisco to advertise a shade addon, because those were the only two things different than yesterday&#8217;s skydive.</p>
<p>i hope tomorrow&#8217;s skydive is better</p>
<p>Nobody&#8217;s going to say it? Ok, I will.</p>
<p>If the highlight of your conference is that you do the same skydive stunt not once, but TWICE, you have nothing interesting to announce at your conference.</p>
<p>Sell your Google stock if you got it.</p>
<p>Lots of interesting news! Compute Engine at least looks very very relevant.</p>
<p>You know why nobody&#8217;s going to say it? Because they, rather we, don&#8217;t troll.</p>
<p>This &#8216;highlight&#8217; is marketing, plain and simple. Made to draw attention to the Glass project to raise interest among the public and developers, so when they add functionality (and lower price, hopefully), it&#8217;ll take off faster.</p>
<p>I can literally list 10 other things right away that could have took place as the event&#8217;s highlight, all with far more substance and real-world practicality, but didn&#8217;t. Why not? Because they were already well-known and would be noticed by users through software updates. Project Glass is starting from scratch, and they want the publicity.</p>
<p>As someone above said, deal with it.</p>
<p>Not sure, but I believe the difference today is that it was being streamed live to a G+ hangout.</p>
<p>Are you sure this isn&#8217;t just a regular snap-on shades, &#8220;compatible&#8221; with regular glasses, that happened to fit these Google-Glasses?&#8230;</p>
<p>Really impressed with Brin.</p>
<p>GG Next version: Brin pointing finger and saying: &#8220;Yes, kill this guy!&#8221;.</p>
<p>I need a pair where the shades slide down ala Deus Ex:HR.</p>

<p>He is an Internet billionaire. Like many of his kind the billionaire part is just a side effect. They don&rsquo;t really know what to do with it. They don&rsquo;t want to act rich.

<p>Actually doesn&rsquo;t look too odd on him.</p>
<p>If they can slim it down a little bit more, and make it easy to attach your prescription glasses, or sunglasses&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s main problem will be the awkwardness for people who don&rsquo;t want to be videoed.  Most people don&rsquo;t want a camera pointed at them in casual converation.  I can imagine saying to a Glass wearer &ldquo;<em>Listen, I&rsquo;m not talking to you unless you take that off</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And then you&rsquo;ll come across that weird transhumanist professor who had his personal eyeglass computer fused to his skull.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t he attacked for that exact reason?</p>
<p>I think that was a different guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;attacked&rdquo; some employee at a fast food restaurant tried to forcibly remove them; he was not beat up &ldquo;attacked&rdquo;, if I remember correctly</p>
<p>Different person.</p>
<p>Chances are that people will get used to others wearing it, over time. I imagine that many reacted badly to the idea of every phone having a camera in it (or, later, HD video recording capability) before it became mainstream.</p>
<p>I would be perplexed if a stranger pointed his or her phone camera at me for no reason. Anyone peering in my direction with a head mounted camera &ndash; just <em>because</em> &ndash; is a freaking weirdo who I am going to avoid as best I can.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that I could imagine that the easiest way to avoid being filmed will be to wear a pair of Google Glasses yourself, to broadcast your privacy preferences to the others =D</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s actually a pretty good solution.  I was thinking they&rsquo;d have to rock a red/green led light to signal to people you aren&rsquo;t filming them</p>
<p>No it isn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s tantamount to blackmail. &ldquo;Buy this gadget or I&rsquo;m invading your privacy because I can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What privacy is being invaded when you are out in public? There is zero expectation of privacy. You are already being photographed multiple times a day if you go out in public.</p>
<p>What kind of a world do you live in? Do you really want anybody and everybody to be able to monitor and record your every move when in public?</p>
<p>What kind of world do I live in? The real world, wherein you have no expectation of privacy in public places.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;real world&rdquo; as envisioned by Google, of course. Let&rsquo;s have 24/7 live videofeed coverage of Brin, Page and Schmid first. Then I&rsquo;ll accept it. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s privacy and security for the powerful and 24/7 monitoring for the rest.</p>
<p>No, the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; as envisioned by <strong>current law</strong>.</p>
<p>What part of &ldquo;the law states you have no expectation of privacy in public&rdquo; do you not understand?</p>
<p>Citation needed. And you&rsquo;d better show that current law allows you to be videotaped and your private conversations monitored by anybody when in public, otherwise you&rsquo;re making this up. How hard would it be to fit powerul snooping devices in these portable devices in the future? Not very, if you&rsquo;ve got Google&rsquo;s money and technology behind it, for sure.</p>
<p>Though there&rsquo;s already tons of security cameras and such that record people everyday in public spaces.</p>
<p>exactly. I&rsquo;d feel much better being recorded by Sergey Brin on the subway, than Chicago PD</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re blaming Google for all of this? What on earth are you even talking about? You&rsquo;ve jumped the shark.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m blaming Google for gathering <strong>everything</strong> into a single database, where it is easily datamined. They&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s premier intelligence-gathering facility. All the rest are siloed. Store security cameras are not directly linked to the IRS DB or the MV license DB. It is possible to collate data from all the available sources, but not yet easily done. Google is turning it into a one-click, real-time operation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;blaming Google for gathering everything into a single database, where it is easily datamined&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google only has what you&rsquo;ve given out publicly. You&rsquo;re angry for that? How illogical. And how utterly paranoid.</p>
<p>They have a bunch of databases&hellip;databi (plural). &ldquo;Databases,&rdquo; for all the people who can&rsquo;t take a joke on this website.</p>
<p>So, the next time I see you in public I&rsquo;ll follow you around with a video camera and long-range sound amplifier. Then publish it to youtube with your name, address and telephone number. And do this every day. And night. When you go visit friends and relatives. And publish those to youtube, also. When your kids go out. When they see their friends. Monitor everybody and publish it to the internet. What a beautiful society you want to live in.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that stalking?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s stalking if it&rsquo;s a single person doing it. If you have multiple sources coming from multiple feeds collated through a single DB it isn&rsquo;t. If even 20% of the population had these devices uploading their feeds to Google, coupled with facial recognition technology, it wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to reconstruct a single person&rsquo;s movements 24/7.</p>
<p>That would require them to be recording every single moment 24/7. Not only are people not gonna want that, it&rsquo;s probably not feasible that the battery will even allow it.</p>
<p>This can and is already done. Ever go to a casino? Ever go outside? Ever use a bank?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So, the next time I see you in public I&rsquo;ll follow you around with a video camera and long-range sound amplifier.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I&rsquo;ll file a restraining order, which is also within my right. You&rsquo;ll also be in trouble for stalking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Then publish it to youtube with your name, address and telephone number.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that is public information, that is your right, but considering the stalking behavior and restraining order, I could have it quickly pulled down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And do this every day. And night.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay! A more restrictive restraining order is coming your way!</p>
<p>Have fun in prison, stalker!</p>
<p>See above reply, idiot.</p>
<p>Put your tinfoil hat on. Your paranoia is showing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to go with Bob on this one, if you don&rsquo;t want to be filmed I suggest you hide in your cave or wrap your entire body in tinfoil&hellip; I hear the hats work!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not a lawyer, are you, Bob.</p>
<p>Can you wear this one in front of a Cop?. I think there are laws in USA that prohibits that you can&rsquo;t record a conversation or film/videotape something. <br />
They are in public and shouldn&rsquo;t they ignore being filmed?.</p>
<p>Oh yea, it is always different when it comes to Cops and normal citizens. Because Cops have privacy even if they are in public place. Go figure.</p>
<p>It is actually completely legal to record an interaction with police. they generally don&rsquo;t like it much, but it is legal. In the USA anyway</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s legal in the rest of the civilized world. only thing is, in the US you might get a beating from a cop for doing it, depending on his mood..<br />
:)</p>
<p>True, though that wouldn&rsquo;t be very wise of the cop, seeing as you&rsquo;d be recording every second of him doing it, from first person perspective.  You&rsquo;d be bruised, but you&rsquo;d also be rich, and that cop would be out of a job :d</p>
<p>Good to know it is legal, but i am sure, it is better to be prepared to be in jail for even trying to record a cop on duty in USA.<br />
We&rsquo;ll wait and see how many people wearing Google glass will be put in jail by cops when it&rsquo;s available freely.</p>
<p>I am not going to be the head of a worldwide company, ride the subway, and then be perplexed by any reaction. Besides, he was filming the whole thing himself.</p>
<p>what about all the surveillance cameras out there on the street corners? got nothing against those?</p>
<p>They are disembodied security cameras.  Yes they bother me a bit, but they are not directly pointing in my face and recording me personally.  It&rsquo;s not a matter of law or rights or privacy.  It&rsquo;s just rude and intimidating.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you live, but if its in a city of any size, chances are you were recorded by multiple, possibly hundreds (if in the UK) of cameras today. They just aren&rsquo;t mounted on heads, they&rsquo;re mounted on buildings.</p>
<p>People did. I remember people were freaking out because whoever had a camera phone could invade your privacy anywhere they want lol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I&rsquo;m not talking to you unless you take that off&rdquo;</p>

<p>thank you. my morning is complete.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only because they&rsquo;re designed <strong>for</strong> him :)</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve only ever seen pictures of him when he was wearing one, so to me he would look more odd without it.</p>
<p>Say What?!?</p>
<p>Was he wearing Crocs?</p>
<p>We need to know!</p>
<p>He has probably enough money to develop Cyborg feet.</p>
<p>Probably something unbranded and in beta like Gmail was for years in beta and now the best e-mail in the megaverse (iPeople exclusive are missing out) =)</p>
<p>Gmail is no different than any other email service. Other than its lack of compatibility, of course.</p>
<p>Two words</p>
<p>Color+labels</p>
<p>(New outlook looks much better but they are still way behind on aesthetics and design, I like metro but it is not finished)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how Outlook.com is way behind Gmail in aesthetics or design, and yes, I used Gmail for years prior to Outlook.com&rsquo;s launch.</p>
<p>Outlook.com has folders that can work like labels.</p>
<p>Folders are not even close to labels &hellip; not even close.</p>
<p>You know, because they actually label things rather than just sort things.</p>
<p>They are actually the same thing.</p>
<p>Labels were just a gimmick to say &ldquo;hey, we&rsquo;re different&rdquo; even though it&rsquo;s the same thing that email has had for how long before Gmail?</p>
<p>Can you apply multiple folders to an email yet?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. That is such a non-factor.</p>
<p>When dealing with email, why would you need to add it to more then one folder? If you&rsquo;re saving something, you&rsquo;re going to archive and search on it. If you don&rsquo;t need to save it, you&rsquo;re going to delete it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter. That is such a non-factor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve figured out the perfect way to deal with ALL email. Please teach us the best way to handle our email.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say I pay for something related to my car.  I might get the confirmation email and decide that I want to label it as &ldquo;Receipt&rdquo; and also label it as &ldquo;Car&rdquo; so I can keep track of car related expenses.  There are LOTS of times when people may want to apply more than one label.</p>
<p>Absolutely brilliant. I love it when people like _toddbloom continue to be indignant after proven to be wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sigh</strong>, double post.</p>
<p>Power users, sure, but why would you save an email in two different places (by the way, you can do this with folders, any way &ndash; at least in Mail.app). If you want to deal with expenses, you&rsquo;d most likely use your banking program.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not often that you look at emails after you reply or read them; usually they just get deleted.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like labels are this amazing feature that puts Gmail above every other client. It&rsquo;s good, sure, but it&rsquo;s not great or the be-all-end-all.</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, the email isn&rsquo;t in two different places, it just in one(1). Labels is more like &hellip; a filter.</p>
<p>the answer to the question &lsquo;why would you need to&rsquo; is almost always answered and applied, despite the limited worldview that asks it.</p>
<p>honestly though, why would anyone ever need more than 640k ram to run their gmail?</p>
<p>You can on a Mac.</p>
<p>Not at all, with folders you were moving things from place to place, labels allows you to keep it where ever and just give it another tag. <br />
Labels is one of the main reasons I stuck with gmail over the competition.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m literally hitting myself on the head right now for mucking it up. Outlook.com has categories, not folders, which does exactly what you want.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of amazing that no one fact-checked Gmail&rsquo;s supposed superiority though.</p>
<p>Yes! I was just in the middle of making a post about categories when your post popped up.</p>
<p>Just logged into Outlook.com to check it out (btw, those bold fonts are gaudy).</p>
<p>Categories are not as easy to access, are not as flexible or capable, and are nowhere near as visible as labels are.</p>
<p>To be honest, they just aren&rsquo;t as good.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Categories are not as easy to access, are not as flexible or capable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are directly visible in the side bar on Outlook.com. YMBJ.</p>
<p>Are they visible on individual emails? If not then they are just rebranded folders (Note: they are not visible).</p>
<p>Also, they are not capable in that outlook does not support the same level of automation and fine-tuning that Gmail has.</p>
<p>Like I said, they are closer to folders than labels (I&rsquo;m now thinking that they are folders).</p>
<p>And as far as IMAP is concerned, Labels <em>are</em> folders. Didn&rsquo;t we all argue about this a few weeks ago?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter, Gmail is inherently light years ahead of the competition and anyone who says otherwise is a complete bozo. I can&rsquo;t even be bothered to reply to the Google circlejerk above, a rather common occurrence on The Verge in recent times.</p>
<p>Right. It&rsquo;s the Google guys who are crazy and yell about every Google related review, right?</p>
<p>Wait, no.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Google guys who invade every comment section regarding Microsoft, Google or Apple and spread their propaganda everywhere. They are most certainly crazy, and they most certainly had a mouthful to speak when lack of LTE handicapped the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>But enjoy living in your tunnel visioned world where those who you disagree with are all generalised as insane, while the fanboys who share your opinion are always perfectly validated in their statements.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is the experience you have in the native apps or on the website is vastly different from connecting to the service via IMAP, because of the standard.</p>
<p>That said, I don&rsquo;t see the point in arguing either case. All I&rsquo;ve done is presented one simple fact (in response to people going on and on about how Gmail labels are some kind of &ldquo;hack&rdquo; on top of IMAP): labels are not folders, but to be able to work with IMAP, they will appear as such to IMAP users.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right on their FAQ about it. I don&rsquo;t know why there needs to be so much drama surrounding this, especially considering Outlook would be no different on IMAP. Of course, using their own proprietary protocol enables them to do more, and connecting through THAT allows a different experience. Just like Gmail&rsquo;s native experience. 2 halves of the same flippin&rsquo; coin.</p>
<p>I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day we were all so goddamn defensive of an <em>email service</em>. Providing compatibility with standards is a legit complaint, or even if one service has uptime problems, but anything beyond that is stupid.</p>
<p>Being able to tag something is not the same as moving it.</p>
<p>New users cant sync with Outlook 2013 using native Exchange ActiveSync.</p>
<p>IMAP and SMTP have been industry standards for a while now.</p>
<p>Two words: no Exchange.</p>
<p>Two words: Good Riddance.</p>
<p>Two words: Cat Food</p>
<p>Two words: Two Words</p>
<p>Two words: &hellip; BREAKING THE CHAIN! muahahahaha</p>
<p>Its spam protection is light years ahead of other free webmail providers<br />
Its labels &amp; flexibility are great<br />
Its apps are great<br />
Some lab experiments are great too like multi inbox to view selected labels in their own panes.<br />
I&rsquo;m also signed up to have Gmail search integrated into my main Google search which has been pretty useful. <br />
I use my gmail account to send/receive &amp; manage my other email address, I&rsquo;ve not found anything that compares.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get the benefits I get out of Gmail anywhere else for the same price, eg. at no charge.</p>
<p>and Google Now cards triggered by Gmail content</p>
<p>Are you trolling? It is compatible with POP3 and IMAP, which was really unconventional for a free email service of this quality until recently.</p>
<p>What lack of compatibility? gmail supports both pop and imap standards.</p>
<p>Lack of compatibility as compared to what?</p>
<p>What are &ldquo;iPeople&rdquo;? Or are you just making an ignorant, trollish comment about people who use iOS devices?</p>
<p>BTW, GMail is great on my iPhone.</p>
<p>Apparently there a people so devoted to the Apple brand that they only use their @me address and the icloud mail client, those are the iPeople</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the problem with that? What if iCloud mail does everything they need it to do? I mean, I use Gmail, but it&#8217;s not the only good mail service out there.</p>
<p>See, what you&rsquo;re doing is speaking rationally and being open-minded.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s NYC.  You spend most of your time ignoring everyone else anyway.  Bigger celebs, even the mayor, use the subway all the time.  It&rsquo;s not really that big a deal.</p>
<p>Project Glass is the next big product Im excited about.  While I&rsquo;ve relied on Google for search, email, video hosting, RSS feeds&hellip;.I&rsquo;ve never been excited for a Google product at this level before.</p>
<p>Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad&hellip;.Project Glass heads up display.  The next huge breakthrough.</p>
<p>Where are Microsoft and Apple in this?!?</p>
<p>probably just like other companies. doing their homework, and testing on the lab and avoiding public places, specially bars.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the Microsoft way, true, always being late to show the big breakthrough product, then hyping it up as being a leap forward.  See Windows 8, Windows Phone, Surface RT&hellip;.Zune, Plays for Sure&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Apple has more of silent development, then huge global coverage mindset.  I don&rsquo;t expect Apple to brag and talk a big game about future products.  But now they also cannot surprise us, or claim to be the market creator.  It&rsquo;s a bind.</p>
<p>You can laugh, but I see some sort of Project Glass device as a mainstream future.  EVERYONE has phones, most are smartphones, unless you are a student or quite poor.  Even the people with real piece of shit phones take photos on them, blurry ass VGA nonsense, unusable.</p>
<p>We rely on our phones as our main gadget, always with us, connected online wherever we go.  GPS navigation, taking photos and videos, showing pictures, apps, games, Facebook, web browsing&hellip;&hellip;but that&rsquo;s very 2009 or so.  We&rsquo;ve had improvements every year or so, but nothing fundamentally different in four years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about time we moved forward again.  No more &ldquo;The New Samsung &ndash; now with a .3 inch bigger screen!!!!!&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m looking forward to Samsung &ldquo;Project Glass&rdquo; style heads up displays competing with Apple &ldquo;iSight&rdquo; HUDs.</p>
<p>In the next one/two/three years, I expect a realistic model to be sold to regular consumers.</p>
<p>Apple will do something wearable with the Nano form factor, I presume that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve made Nanos bigger again &amp; they&rsquo;ll come out with a smartwatch for iOS devices in that small, last gen Nano form.</p>
<p>Not sure which way Microsoft will go in wearable, perhaps &ndash; their big research project, Surface table is obviously now Surface tablet and it&rsquo;s pretty far from a success outside of Microsoft jerk circles and that&rsquo;s despite billions on advertising.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s laughably backwards compared to a true Project Glass HUD.  An iPod Nano with a two inch screen max strapped uncomfortably to your arm&hellip;.it can&rsquo;t compete with a Google device which fills your entire eyes field of vision.</p>
<p>Heads Up Displays are meant to be a natural augmentation (oxymoron? :-) ), you don&rsquo;t even notice something has become a part of you.</p>
<p>A plastic or metal thing strapped to your arm cannot feel as integrated, as natural.  You cannot hold your arm up and try and take a video with your hand moving up down, left and right to take it all in.</p>
<p>With Project Glass, you effectively say &ldquo;record video&rdquo; etc and then simply look at where you want to record.  Saying &ldquo;stop recording&rdquo; ends the video process, the system automatically filtering out the last bit of audio where you directly spoke to the system from the permanent recording.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an iPhone user and think that the iPhone 5 is by far the best phone on the market, hands down.</p>
<p>But regular customers worldwide seem to be increasingly going Samsung, a massive screen and for a lower price too.  I&rsquo;ve heard these future customers talk about iPhones as though they were lazy, pretentious show offs, who&rsquo;ve been outclassed and out competed by the hardworking hero of the people, Samsung.  &ldquo;Look at that tiny screen, and its nearly twice the price!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the current Android makers all have Android running on a Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Nexus, Nokia&hellip;..Project Glass device, and selling tens of millions a year&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.and Apple is like &ldquo;hey guys!  iPhone Nano!  Strap it on your wrist with it&rsquo;s big hemp strap, and its slim metal body can be pointed here and there to record video!  Two inch screen!  500 bucks!&rdquo; &hellip;..it&rsquo;s going to be beyond embarrassing.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft gave up on the idea already in 2004. Seems like Google took the concept and trying in a different way.</p>

<p>Kinda like tablets.</p>
<p>Probably worrying about creating something that is ACTUALLY useful unlike these gimmicky glasses.</p>
<p>Hagrids wife right there</p>
<p>I lol&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Noah might have recorded the moment, but so did Sergey</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see the Brin view side.</p>
<p>He is an out and out pimp. He looks like he wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to get up and slap you. Lol.</p>
<p>Google Glasses now counts as VR? Pff.<br />
How can a tiny display on the top right be considered VR?!? That&rsquo;s a disgrace to every proper VR Apps, and devices. It&rsquo;s ER at best.</p>
<p>Plus it looks half backed, like it wants to be VR but is to shy to cover a full eye.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even out yet and I hate it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even out yet and I hate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the Internet for, if not the sharing of these little nuggets of unfathomable hate?</p>
<p>Cats.</p>
<p>And porn.  Mostly porn.</p>
<p>Because VR would be appropriate for a subway. If you don&rsquo;t like this kind of product, I don&rsquo;t think tech blogs are for you&hellip;</p>
<p>Did Noah spot a bodyguard?  Would Sergey have a bodyguard?</p>
<p>Keanu Reeves-2 detected :)</p>
<p>The billionaire in the sub, the glasses, the bag&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just too awesome.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m straight, but I&rsquo;m gay for Sergey!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The billionaire in the sub, the glasses, the bag&hellip;</p>

<p>Agreed. </p>
<p>Ya that bastard is cool.</p>
<p>Noah Zerkin: &#8220;Can I take a photo of you, Mr Brin?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sergey Brin: &#8220;Why not?  I&#8217;ve already Instant Uploaded 10 photos of you&#8221;</p>
<p>unfortunately there is no damn signal on nyc subway, so he couldn&rsquo;t have uploaded anything.</p>
<p>Maybe Project Glass will one day turn into this ;-)<br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSU0lTCMTZw&hd=1" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSU0lTCMTZw&amp;hd=1</a></p>
<p>First I was thinking, &ldquo;Dammit I missed him!&rdquo;, then I saw the train number. I never ride the 3 train :|<br />
Ah well.</p>
<p><img title="PATENT LAWSUIT FROM THE FUTURE!" src="http://i.imgur.com/YCKlFwj.jpg" alt="PATENT LAWSUIT FROM THE FUTURE!" /></p>
<p>Futile indeed</p>
<p>I wonder if he had those glasses reboot like my nexus 10 does all the time? As a matter of fact it rebooted as I was reading this so I registered to post after I waited for the reboot. Come on Google Android team  when will you take this seriously.</p>
<p>I wonder if it will be laggy like my Nexus 7.</p>
<p>On the bright side, you didn&rsquo;t have to wait nearly as long as I did when I had my Nexus One reboot&hellip; it felt like that phone took an hour to boot.</p>
<p>If there is an award for the coolest billionaire then Sergey Brin is definitely winning it.</p>
<p>Richard Branson has a aerospace company.</p>
<p>He has a manned spaceship.</p>
<p>This is&hellip;news?</p>
<p>Well considering it&rsquo;s SERGEY BRIN wearing GOOGLE GLASS (a product that the earliest adopters haven&rsquo;t gotten their hands on yet) on a train is enough to make it newsworthy.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s wearing the world&rsquo;s stupidest &ldquo;invention&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Big deal.</p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;ve used your Google Glass so extensively to form such an opinion, would you mind letting me have yours?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>One does not need to use something to know that something has a niche audience.</p>
<p>so what you say is invalid.</p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>It is and will continue to be a worthless item that only the most crazed fans will use. Nobody sane is going to look like that much of an idiot walking down the street with those things.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s been said already&hellip; About cellphones&hellip;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t wear cellphones on your face and you&rsquo;re not talking constantly to thin air with them.</p>
<p>And, if you do want to use the cell phone analogy, think about how stupid people look already with their nose buried in a smartphone screen while walking down the street.</p>
<p>You need to get out more. I see people with their phone attached to the side of their head seemingly non stop.</p>
<p>And, as I said, they look foolish and stupid.</p>
<p>Okay old geezer. Go shake your fists at the kids in your lawn.</p>
<p>Google Glass will also be integrated with sunglasses, which twenty two million people in southern California wear most of the year already. Glass won&rsquo;t look that different on people who already wear glasses, or sunglasses. The more people wear them the more the general population will get used to the look. Maybe they&rsquo;ll never catch on where you live, but world-wide there&rsquo;s a market for them of tens or hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>Just what we need. More idiots walking into walls because they can&rsquo;t wait an hour to get home to post a status message about their day.</p>
<p>At least I&rsquo;ve disabused you of the idea that Glass is worthless. Sadly no way to change you from being a curmudgeon, judging by a quick look at your past comments. Looks like when you dislike or disagree with something you prefer to call it names instead of backing up your reasons.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s still a worthless gimmick. Why would you think it&rsquo;s not?</p>
<p>Because if there&rsquo;s a way to sip-power and record a continuous loop of the last minute, it could record car accidents, fights, police brutality as they unfold and then with wearer input, upload the clip to the cloud where it can only be deleted from a home computer with a password.</p>
<p>For people who can&rsquo;t afford luxury cars, it can replace the windshield projected display. For an unfamiliar interchange or simply confusing ones, it can use GPS combined with image recognition to tell drivers which lane to get in. It can do this using voice instead of taking the driver&rsquo;s eyes off the road.</p>
<p>In a supermarket it can use image recognition and a crowdsourced map to know where items are. Then it can keep a grocery list, remind users of what they&rsquo;re out of, and what they&rsquo;re forgetting to pick up as they walk past things, and when traveling at unfamiliar stores, direct them to items. It could even suggest other stores that have items for less. At a grocery store that&rsquo;s not as big a deal, but for expensive electronics or other goods it is.</p>
<p>For everyday use it means users don&rsquo;t have to get the phone out of their pocket and enter a passcode to see text messages before deciding if they want to reply.</p>
<p>It also will make finding your car in a huge mall parking lot easier because it can do that automatically with GPS and image recognition to know where it is and what&rsquo;s going on. Using existing apps on a phone just isn&rsquo;t as easy and simple. If you dislike malls and just want to get in and out it can direct you through the mall to the store.</p>
<p>At a concert or convention center it could similarly help direct users to find friends or coworkers using shared location data. No it wouldn&rsquo;t share locations with the whole world unless told to. Phone apps already do this, but it&rsquo;s easier when the display and audible directions are on your head.</p>
<p>There will be other uses. With more imagination on your part perhaps you can think of some of them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been said about every non-incremental advance. I just wonder why people who read tech sites are the ones saying it so often.</p>
<p>Google Glass being a niche device should go without saying.</p>
<p>And yet, you&rsquo;re replying like your life depends on it.</p>
<p>Excuse me but you are incorrect. <br />
This is not even the stupidest invention, but it is clearly worse than Google Glass.</p>
<p><img title="Pizza Fork is not as cool as Google Glass" src="http://www.toxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/pizzacutters07.jpg" alt="Pizza Fork is not as cool as Google Glass" /></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Bigger news than Steve Jobs&rsquo; yacht if you ask me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not if you ask me.</p>
<p>but it is.</p>
<p>No one asked you.</p>
<p>To be fair, it actually doesn&rsquo;t look that bad or intrusive. I could totally walk around with one.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t over until the fat lady sings.</p>
<p>He rides the subway.</p>
<p>Most impressive thing ever.</p>
<p>Leave it to the Verge to post a non-story just because it has Google in the title&hellip;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t click the link? Oh. You already did.</p>
<p>He probably thought it would be actual news and more than just a Google executive rides the subway&hellip; I thought surely there must be more to the story than that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought surely there must be more to the story than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly no&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sergey Brin rides the NYC subway like a Google boss</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly were you expecting?</p>
<p>Train surfing?</p>
<p>I was expecting news. I don&rsquo;t like to read too much into the Headlines because sometimes they are misleading. Anyways didn&rsquo;t think an executive riding the subway warranted news. I guess I learned that Sergey sometimes uses the subway and wears full ninja regalia&hellip;</p>
<p>Even the writer was struggling to turn this into news so makes jokes, repeats already known info and comments on his attire.</p>
<p>I find the fact that Sergey Brin was seen randomly riding a NYC subway, without an entourage, wearing an unreleased set of Google Glass (which have themselves been the subject of many posts, of anticipated products) to be right up the alley of TheVerge.</p>
<p>It is certainly more relevant to theVerge.com, than your comment here suggesting that this somehow does not fit in with Tech, tech culture, or culture culture.</p>
<p>If it was a story about trying to trade a surface tablet for a bottle of cooking wine with a homeless man, or Steve Jobs/Johnny Ive sporting unreleased wearable electronics then yes that too would fit here.</p>
<p>tl:dr   Don&rsquo;t read it if you don&rsquo;t find it news. Vote with your eyes, don&rsquo;t spew gibberish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he was just playing Ingress. He can probably get an invite, right?</p>
<p>Why are there constant articles on any little thing someone or someone&rsquo;s kid does from Google? Srsly The Verge has a major hard on for Google right now.</p>
<p>Uh, that&rsquo;s what tech blogs do.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t report on actual news they just act as the PR machine of Google. It&rsquo;s been that way for a while now and it&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re becoming less relevant each day.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a tech blog.</p>
<p>You want them to NOT talk about Google products?</p>
<p>Looks like you&rsquo;re just hatin&rsquo; on them.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a Google product and neither was that other article. Find a comment from me on any article with information about a product of Google&rsquo;s where I said it was a waste of time/unnecessary.</p>
<p>I saw Eric Schmidt at a lesbian club down in the west village&hellip; just sayn.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a PR trick guys &hellip;be sure about that&hellip; Google want&rsquo;s their glasses to be again &rsquo;talk of the town" :)</p>
<p>We are so lucky that an AR enthusiast was in the train at the same time!</p>
<p>Good luck getting a cell signal when in the underground portions of the NYC subway.</p>
<p>Cant wait to start reading people&rsquo;s power levels</p>

<p>If he want to come to Philly, I&rsquo;d be happy to give him a tour of our subway system under the condition I can borrow the glasses for five minutes&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;nevermind for like a day.</p>
<p>So now we know why Google is providing free internet in NYC Subway lines&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this pre-planned and clearly successful PR stunt, The Google co-founder was recently spotted on the downtown 3 train, dressed in full ninja regalia and sporting his company&rsquo;s Project Glass augmented reality eyewear.</p>

<p>Fixed that for you Verge</p>
<p>The lady left of him is hiding two personal body guards in her pink jacket.</p>
<p>One wonders if the people sitting next to him that day had any clue <em>who</em> they were riding the train with?</p>
<p>Anyone else notice that, on the average Verge article, you have to scroll <strong>up</strong> further to get to article after reading comments than you have to scroll <strong>down</strong> to get <em>to</em> the comments? Yet, none of you are paid for actually creating all this content. You donate it. Interesting. Because the clickery happening here as a result of the comments is what actually earns Verge the cash.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not complaining, and I don&rsquo;t want it to stop. Because, in honesty, reading Verge for its articles is like reading Playboy for its articles. Recommend if you only come here for the sexy-ass commentary, aren&rsquo;t afraid to admit it and really just want to look at more pictures of more shit you can&rsquo;t have :)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a harsh reality, folks. I just woke up to it. Refreshing, though.</p>

<p>I think I could learn more about tech from watching monkeys flinging poo than by readings these comments, and now I know why.</p>
<p>Careful Sergey, as an earthling, Apple may supress it&rsquo;s innovation level.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a regular Tony Stark, that Sergey.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did Steve Jobs ever ride the Subway or any public transportation?</p>
<p>It might look like he is smiling at you Noah Zerkin, but he is actually busy accessing your Gmail account.</p>
<p>i know its still a concept but i still don&rsquo;t understand why this has to be a clunky piece of plastic attached to your glasses.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s one cool coat</p>
<p>From Sergey&rsquo;s Google Glass live feed:<br />
A fellow rider offers a Subway &ldquo;footlong&rdquo; to Sergey.<br /><img title="" src="http://img805.imageshack.us/img805/680/subways.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Needs lenses.</p>
<p>Nice. I wish google wasn&rsquo;t focused on their driverless cars for a solution to anything. Driverless cars are an amazing piece of tech with no real purpose. It doesn&rsquo;t help solve our congested roads, health issues caused by a driving culture, or pollution. I realize Sergey riding the subway once isn&rsquo;t an indicator of anything, but imagine if he realized the potential of public transport in livable walkable areas (which most google campuses are not). Would have a huge positive impact. Plus on transit you can safely use your smartphone, or google glasses.</p>
<p>Well, driverless cars can potentially take up less space on the road as they can move as a &lsquo;train&rsquo;. If you add networking to driverless cars, allowing them to talk to one another&hellip; it may not yet fully solve congested roads, but it sure would help.</p>

<p>I keep thinking about which awesome games could be made for this. And gamers would even be able to exercise while playing. Looking forward to see what this will bring.</p>
<p>Look at Zombies, Run , an iPhone game that really kicks ass</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zombiesrungame.com" target="_blank">www.zombiesrungame.com</a></p>
<p>Imagine that with a real, actual Heads Up Display :-)</p>
<p>The gamification of workout apps would reach another level !</p>
<p>Yes, tie in WoW progress with your workout progress &#8211; no lvl85 for you until you can bench 250lbs or no epic mount for you till you can run a mile in 8min &#8211; and you will see some real reduction in overweight WoW players :D</p>
<p>You encounter one of your friends in a park. He is running seemingly randomnly. You ask him if he is alright. He answers : &quot;can&#8217;t talk. Zombies ! Zombies everywhere! &quot;</p>
<p>Who said that I haven&#8217;t had such encounters already?</p>
<p>wast thinking the same thing, my friend has that and he uses it while jogging.  With heads up it would be wild.</p>
<p>When he talking about Paul meeting him, i expected to see Paul Miller :(</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping for the small chance that we get a waterproof one. It would be handing for rafting/canoeing/kayaking or just swimming in the pool with the kiddos.</p>
<p>Or if you get caught in the rain while walking down the street.</p>
<p>*handy</p>
<p>Neato.  A new kind of toy to look forward to in the next year or so.<br />
I&#8217;ll be keen to hear the Apple, Microsoft, Sony etc announcements of similar things in the coming months.</p>
<p>One company says &#8220;This is the Next Big Thing&#8221; and everyone else will jump in.</p>
<p>Accept when they have nothing to show. It&#8217;s like what the iPad was to Android tablets, years ahead of the rest</p>
<p>But Google got those tablets out there good and fast.  Honeycomb was famously rushed into service before it was ready.  Microsoft was pitching those horrible Windows 7 tablets.</p>
<p>Apple won&#8217;t be making such a product any time soon. The geeky nerd market is far too small and this product is far too niche (and silly).</p>
<p>Why even bring up apple? We&#8217;re talking about google.  Unless you&#8217;re just an asshole who spends too much time hating a company. Are you an asshole with too much time on your hands?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re in the same field, you retard. Do you seriously think they don&#8217;t compete with each other? It&#8217;s extremely damn relevant what their responses are to Google products..</p>
<p>Well, yes I am, but it wasn&#8217;t my intention to single out and specificly insult Apple.</p>
<p>You know I re-read what you wrote and I don&#8217;t know why I saw sarcasm and maliciousness in it.  My apologies.</p>
<p>Take your time, Google. Get it all right before shipping. This <em>will</em> change everything as far as mobile technology goes.</p>
<blockquote>Take your time, Google. Get it all right before shipping</blockquote>
<p>LOL @ Google taking time and releasing a fully baked product.</p>
<p>Designers have always had a perfect vision of  &#8220;wearable&#8221; tech working &#8220;seamlessly&#8221; in the future.</p>
<p>They need to get the ID right, and not just talking aesthetics, they need to consider a huge scope of daily routines people go through while wearing these, show us a more holistic/contextual design approach.</p>
<p>The engineering will be tough, basically packing everything a modern phone has, chips, sensors, camera, ports, memory, gps + all, and putting it in an even smaller package. Seeing where the project is now, realistically it&#8217;ll be another year or 2 for a really polished device if they&#8217;re really on it.</p>
<p>Battery is a space eater, perhaps an external battery pack, or even external components pack to keep the HUD lightweight. Thats where it can get fussy, its a fine line between design and functionality. No one will wear these all day, if they weigh a lot or have multiple pieces to mske ith work. Could have Cloud capabilities, or connected to your mobile via bluetooth (ie. smart/pebble watch), then it becomes a &#8220;dummy&#8221; device with fewer features/components.</p>
<p>Interesting projects like this and the autonomous vehicles is what drives society forward.<br />
Goodluck Google + you&#8217;re welcome!</p>
<p>These glasses better not come with the same Nexus Prime camera.</p>

Not to bad video quality for a prototype.</p>
<p>Soo&#8230; you may want to go take a look at the Verge&#8217;s coverage, including this one: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/25/3042684/google-project-glass-video-sample/in/2689413">First video sample from Google&#8217;s Project Glass</a></p>
<p>Nexus Prime? Can&#8217;t seem to find the review on that device.</p>
<p>where are all the ads? :)</p>
<p>don&#8217;t need em when you are breaking into the hardware business.</p>
<p>thats a good one!</p>
<p>Google doing hardware will be worse than Apple doing social or Microsoft doing consumer software.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll be there when you say &#8220;Search for gourmet burger&#8221;. You dont got ads all over the Android operatin system either, you do however have them in the apps, but google loves your information so they can serve you the ads where they might belong.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t be ads. They&#8217;ll be sponsored results&#8230;</p>
<p>This is the future. No more cellphones. Just Google Glass and Tablets.</p>
<p>Not if it&#8217;s Android only.</p>
<p>Shut. Up. And. Take. My. Money.</p>
<p>Pity I have 20/20 vision.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually glasses free. They&#8217;re working on a prescription glasses version. So you&#8217;re actually fine.</p>
<p>None of the protoypes have had prescription glass in them.</p>
<p>Dont you know? In the future, everyone will have perfect 20/20 vision :)</p>
<p>With all the smartphones, tablets, and computer screens, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if our vision evolved into severe nearsightedness, and we all ended up needing glasses for distance.</p>
<p>As long as you&#8217;re a candidate for LASIK, the future is now. The rest of the population will have to make due with driverless cars.</p>
<p>Meh. Vic Gundotra wears glasses. Pretty sure Sergei wears contacts. The thing&#8217;s being built by nerds&#8230;.I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;ll work with glasses.</p>
<p>Daniel Suarez&#8217;s book Daemon is a must read if you think this stuff if cool.</p>
<p>As intensely nerdy this gadget maybe&#8230;I still, oddly enough, want to have one. Hopefully the experience mirrors close enough to what&#8217;s seen in the video whenever this gets released.</p>
<p>Can someone explain to me how this works? I always thought that ui overlays in glasses were an impracticality because of the whole inability to focus at multiple depths simultaneously thing.</p>
<p>The way Google Glass and other HUDs work is that they basically project an image, rather than having a simple LCD. It gives the impression of the UI being at a certain point in space, with a certain focus. <br />
So, yeah, basically <em>beaming the internet into your eye.</em> Pretty cool.</p>
<p>The thing that makes me skeptical is power, you clearly can&#8217;t fit a sufficiently powerful battery into the little eye piece,  so how big is the battery back you have to wear on your belt? This thing is, after all, constantly running a mic and transmitting data to google&#8217;s servers to translate, not to mention it appears it is analyzing the video feed as well, so how much data are we talking about, and how long can that run? If you used a cell phone (most of which are already too large due to battery needs and cellular chip needs) for this function it would nuke the battery in a matter of a few hours, especially while running gps etc. so there has to be something they&#8217;re not showing us in the video that makes use practical. Perhaps it only will respond to voice when you press a button or something of that nature, or will only analyze voice data until you make a request of your surroundings, that at least would tone down the data needs.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the other issue, you&#8217;re going to burn a ton of cellular data on something like this, have they thought about how that will work visa vis the cell phone companies who are capping 4g data at 5gb per month?</p>
<p>These are the reasons many of the replies to the original Glass articles pointed out that it would make the most sense as a display-only device, perhaps connected by Bluetooth to a smart phone.</p>
<p>But so far&#8230; It&#8217;s a camera! For your head!</p>
<p>He&#8217;s really trying to thread the needle. It&#8217;s not meant to be some futuristic dream, but it depicted &#8220;features Google hopes to have in the first version of the product.&#8221; It&#8217;s not supposed to be &#8220;many years away,&#8221; but it won&#8217;t be out this year.</p>
<p>If there aren&#8217;t already regulatory hurdles to widespread use of this type of system, I sure hope some pop up. People already text and drive and do a ton of other distracting things while behind the wheel, throw in a HUD, and it&#8217;s going to be worse. Not to mention the increasing withdrawal of actual social interaction. We all have the internet in our pockets now, and it&#8217;s causing some pretty blatant social withdrawal, throw it all up right in front of your eye all the time and we&#8217;ll just have a slew of zombie geeks walking around staring through you at their augmented reality.</p>
<p>Looks awesome. Can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>In Soviet Russia Glasses help see you!</p>
<p> i keep throwing money at the screen but nothings happening!!</p>
<p>I keep hoping this joke will die but nothing&#8217;s happening!</p>
<p>who said it was a joke&#8230;..lol ok i kid.</p>
<p>I tried to stop that joke, but then I took an arrow to the knee.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the screen is just an image in your glasses, there is no screen.</p>
<p>the future is now</p>
<p>The future better be better than this&#8230;</p>
<p>Take my money!! You can definitely tell that it is working in some way shape or form.</p>
<p>Something tells me there will be a law which will make it illegal to wear glasses and drive. Oh that wouldn&#8217;t matter actually once Google&#8217;s self driving cars come out =D</p>
<p>Forgot to ask, how does one focus with these glasses? By narrowing the eyes?</p>
<p>It has lytro technology. ;)</p>
<p>ha!</p>
<p>it reads your iris dilation I&#8217;d imagine. The dilation is proportional to the focal length.</p>
<p>That makes no sense&#8230; <br />
1. You can&#8217;t consciously control the dilation of your pupil.<br />
2. It would make more sense for aperture considering that is what your pupil is&#8230; an aperture diagram&#8230;</p>
<p>that&#8217;s why he said it reads your dilation.  implying that it reacts to whatever your dilation currently is so you can see it</p>
<p>pupil dilation isn&#8217;t what causes your eyes to focus, constriction of the lens inside your eyes control focus. Pupil dilation only controls the amount of light getting in.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&#8217;t understand the eye well enough to understand your question, but the image sits above your field of view. It doesn&#8217;t project on your entire glasses field of view. it&#8217;s just a little screen that is located up and to the right.</p>
<p>So I guess it would take pics with focus set to infinity I guess. After all it&#8217;s still in beta, it would be awesome if they figured out how to shrink and fit in Lytro-like tech (as @jblara&#8217;s pointed out).</p>
<p>@DaGetz&#8217;s is that a fact or is that a theory? If it&#8217;s actually possible how does it affect people who have problems in the eye. In a lot of people the eyes don&#8217;t dilate properly and hence end up wearing glasses.</p>
<p>Ohhhh for picture taking. I&#8217;m dumb.</p>
<p>Ha ha relax such stuff happens&#8230;.</p>
<p>Its fact the lens behind the iris is what focuses the eye. It is either stretched or relaxed and that changes the focus. This can be measured by sticking a tiny camera looking at the eye and measuring the dilation. Its not particularly new technology. They have been doing this in AR glasses for quite a while.</p>
<p>For taking pictures you can probably stick it at infinity and get away with it but the technology requires to know what the eye is focused on in order to function. It needs to know when you are focused on the icons, it needs to know what building you are focused on for AR information overlays etc.</p>
<p>I believe this technology (don&#8217;t quote me on this) came from the helicopter pilots in the US Army. Because all four of their limbs are occupied I think they have a little camera observing their eye for targeting. All that is needed is for you to look at an object and it can calculate direction and distance just by looking at the eye and all you need to do is press the fire button.</p>
<p>HUDs in military pilot helmets are trajectory based, and are controlled by the pilot&#8217;s head movement, in conjunction with sensors in the cockpit, not by their eyes. They don&#8217;t measure a pilot&#8217;s focused eyes, and they most certainly are WAY too complex to fit into a glasses frame. I can say, with quite a bit of confidence, that Google isn&#8217;t doing anything that complex in this project. The camera on these is likely just like cheap spy cams that you buy at a gimmick shop that look like giant hipster glasses, or cheap cell phone cameras. They are wide angle, fixed focus lenses. An eye gesture triggers the shutter. There likely is no focus or aperture type settings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably just stuck at infinity like every cellphone camera before smartphones.</p>
<p>I think I heard something about you adjust them to where you like them and then they are, more or less, calibrated for your use&#8230; but don&#8217;t quote me on that.</p>
<p>My wallet is ready.</p>
<p>Great!  Buy me one too!  :)</p>
<p>Does your wallet know what Joshua Topolsky knows?</p>
<p>Google has been kicking tech ass with hands-free eyewear communicator, autonomous vehicle, etc. while Apple is still pitching 3.5&quot; old backlit LCD.  Come on Apple, get with the times!</p>
<p>You do realize that Google is not shipping any of that stuff and that Apple&#8217;s R&amp;D is completely top-secret?  I&#8217;m not saying this Google stuff is not cool, just saying that Microsoft and Google talk about their R&amp;D publicly, while Apple keeps it all behind closed doors.</p>
<p>That 3.5&quot; screen is still over 4 years old tho&#8230; No excuse.</p>
<p>Really, that 356ppi screen is 4 years old.</p>
<p>Do you even try to educate yourself about the technology or just through out completely inane rants about companies that you feel for some reason aren&#8217;t doing enough for you.</p>
<p>Narcissist much?</p>
<p>That retina display on the iPhone has better resolution than every phone at it&#8217;s screen size. Some of us don&#8217;t want a huge ass phone with a 5 inch screen. So your statement that it&#8217;s 4 years old is just plain wrong, the tech behind it is still better than most other displays. OLED, Super OLED whatever, the fact is that Apple outsells those devices and only when you compare ALL android devices do you get near the Apple market share on phones.</p>
<p>Stop kidding yourself.</p>
<p>Contradictory to talk about the PPI benefit of a tiny useless 3.5&quot;.  On a monitor or TV perhaps where you can see the difference but definitely not on 3.5&quot; unless you put it under a microscope or maybe stick it in your face.</p>
<p>Do you even know what &#8220;PPI&#8221; stands for?  PPI is the one spec that is great all sizes.  A big-screen TV with that PPI would have an insane resolution.  However a &#8220;retina TV&#8221; need not have that high a resolution because you view it from further away.  By definition the 300+ PPI is actually best on smaller handheld screens.</p>
<p>I have a 40&quot; LCD TV on my desk that I use as a TV/monitor so in this particular case I&#8217;ll most likely see the difference.</p>
<blockquote>Contradictory to talk about the PPI benefit of a tiny useless 3.5&quot;.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, because an index card can never be more useful than a legal pad… And a motorbike is never more useful than a monster truck.</p>
<p>The ideal dimensions of a tool need to be optimised for a given set of purposes.</p>
<p>First off, you need to educate yourself &#8212; it is NOT 356ppi. I couldn&#8217;t give AF about the resolution. It&#8217;s still too damn small for my hands &#8212; I don&#8217;t have girly hands. The 4.65&quot; 720p display on my Galaxy Nexus works just fine, and quite roomy. That&#8217;s what I prefer. First 720p on a mobile phone &#8212; innovation I like. Apple can keep that 4:3 aspect ratio&#8230; it&#8217;s 2012, not 1992.</p>
<blockquote>That retina display on the iPhone has better resolution than every phone at it’s screen size.</blockquote>
<p>Pretty sure it&#8217;s probably the <strong><em>only</em></strong> phone being sold right at that screen size. Easy win there. I don&#8217;t want a 5&quot; screen either &#8212;  who said they wanted that? I prefer not to be a &#8216;me too&#8217; customer. Android is what I like, and iOS is too crippled for my liking. Same boring UI on the same dainty screen.</p>
<p>The people speak with their purchases: 750,000 devices sold. Per day. Most people prefer options that Apple don&#8217;t have. The numbers never lie.</p>
<blockquote>The 4.65&quot; 720p display on my Galaxy Nexus works just fine, and quite roomy. That’s what I prefer. First 720p on a mobile phone — innovation I like.</blockquote>
<p>Innovation is being the first to make a mass success out of something fundamentally different from prior mass successes. Neither a 5&quot; screen nor a 720p resolution, nor a 316 PPI (18 months after the retina) really qualify.</p>
<p>So.. it&#8217;s an innovation because they made a 3.5&quot; 4:3 display with a high pixel density, but the first Super AMOLED 720p display for a mobile phone isn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>Newsflash&#8230; Apple wasn&#8217;t the first company to put a 300+ PPI display on a phone. The 2008 LG-LU1400 phone had a higher PPI&#8230; 333 vs 326. It&#8217;s probably one reason Apple went with an LG display.</p>
<p>The 2007 Toshiba Portege G900 was the first smartphone advertised with &#8220;print quality&#8221; (300PPI or more) at 311 PPI. It&#8217;s probably why Apple made up the &#8220;retina&#8221; term, so they wouldn&#8217;t sound like second place and years late. The 2008 Xperia X1 also had 311PPI.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t innovate that screen. Or any of their hardware. They just provide software.<br />
Apple, on the other hand, did design the retina display (which paved the way to a 720p mobile phone screen).</p>
<p>Read the &#8220;mass success&#8221; part. If you&#8217;re in the consumer electronics space and introduce a new technology and no one wants to use it, then you have not figured out how to make it deliver value. Anyone can throw a bunch of experimental components together. Think of it this way – the best smartphones pre-iPhone 4 all had much lower PPIs than the best smartphones today. Just like the best smartphones pre-iPhone all looked a lot different from how they look today. On the other hand, there were both high PPI phones and 720p screens pre Galaxy Nexus. So what was the innovation? The ability to solve 720/316/9*16 ?</p>
<p>Mind you, the iPhone screen is 3:2 – it&#8217;s the iPad that is 4:3.</p>
<p>Yes, ddpacino is being rather trollish, and the iPhone screen is very good, but I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s the best around. And frankly, pixel density isn&#8217;t the only important factor &#8211; I&#8217;d say size, resolution, and backlight are actually more important. <br />
Plus, the 356ppi aspect of the screen is not 4 years old. <br />
In fact, the iPhone had absolutely horrible pixel density until the 4 came along. I remember switching from an iPhone 3G to a Palm Pre Plus and being impressed by the pixel density. <br />
And Google does a lot more cool research than Apple you can&#8217;t deny that. They research alternative energy, self driving cars, augmented reality, translation, had voice control and dictation tech long before Siri, etc. A lot more research that doesn&#8217;t directly pertain to their industry &#8211; Apple only cares about doing things that will make them money directly. Google makes most of it&#8217;s money from one aspect of it&#8217;s business, so it lets it&#8217;s employees work on and even bring to market things of no particular value to the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 326ppi.</p>
<p>Take it from a professional troll, using biased comments that are factually correct are much better for trolling than using biased comments that aren&#8217;t&#8230;  Keep that in mind next time.</p>
<p>stupid much</p>
<p>Top secret or not, aside from the usual engineering research that is required to build upon or improve products, I don&#8217;t personally think I&#8217;ve seen many examples of apple research that are on the caliber of this. Some of their more amazing things (siri and a4 processor) were either purchased or made out of house. They&#8217;re great with implementation and iterative improvements of technology, but I can&#8217;t recall anything that they have showed off that has been a first of it&#8217;s kind type showing. Unless I&#8217;m wrong, in which case please correct me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how people get so hyped up on a tech demo of a product that takes horrible pictures.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know that in a prototype, you need a camera that makes perfect photos with who knows what resolution&#8230;</p>
<p>Really, I feel that if it was an Apple product you probably wouldn&#8217;t have that opinion unless the camera resolution was way better than every other phone out there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how because it&#8217;s google people are saying things like &#8220;I&#8217;ll buy one now&#8221;. Yet if it was apple you would all be calling them apple sheep, etc.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the &#8220;etc&#8221;?  Where can you buy these products you mention?</p>
<p>You do understand that they are in pretty different markets and have very different business models.  Apple makes tech with nice designs and great usability by the masses for todays technology.  Google uses it&#8217;s immense R&amp;D for creating new markets around mainly software to tie people in to it&#8217;s other core services, which in turn tie into advertising.  I wish people would stop comparing the two companies.</p>
<p>In other words, Google tends to toil in the lab on far flung projects while Apple ships products. Interesting.</p>
<p>Hah, decent turnaround time from the tip. :) Here&#8217;s a screenshot that showed the rest of the device.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VDCom.png" /></p>
<p>That big ass lump behind the ear I&#8217;m sure is comfortable and not heavy at all.</p>
<p>Thank you, I almost hit &#8220;Buy&#8221; on Amazon.</p>
<p>Is manufactured by Samsung, it&#8217;ll be light as a feather.</p>
<p>its a prototype</p>
<p>How did I know you&#8217;d probably come in here and say something trollish?</p>
<p>They can probably make the battery comfortable.  Whether they can make it last all day is another question&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Pq3VB.jpg" /></p>
<p>Another question is whether you really want something emitting microwaves that close to your skull all day.  There&#8217;s already some controversy about whether cellphones are safe, and those aren&#8217;t pressed tightly against your skull for hours and hours every day.  The phrase &#8220;inverse square law&#8221; comes to mind&#8230;</p>
<p>LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>is it any better in your pocket? inverse square law and all.</p>
<p>i guess that depends on whether you care more about your brain or your hip.</p>
<p>they make replacement hips.</p>
<p>dude this UI is from 90&#8217;s</p>
<p>well, you know, after unlocking and rooting and overclocking my stock glasses, I was able to ssh into my glasses and flash them with a custom third-party ROM and install this really cool retro theme.</p>
<p>So is ICS&#8230;</p>
<p>Perv goggles (Ogle Goggles?) are about to revolutionize the candid pr0n game.</p>
<p>Creepy. Cool, but creepy.</p>
<p>Uh&#8230; I didn&#8217;t mean to post this as a reply to you, so uh&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>awkwardly shuffles away</strong></p>
<p>In the future when hands-free eyewear communicators are the norm it&#8217;ll be creepy to look back and imagine someone holding a useless 3.5&quot;.</p>
<p>It will be a while before you won&#8217;t be mocked for wearing this. And if you wear it to elementary or high school, I can pretty much guarantee you&#8217;ll get your ass kicked for it.</p>
<p>Until people realize that celebrities are wearing them. Which I guarantee they will.</p>
<p>Professionals will be early adopters so juveniles need not worry.</p>
<p>If they come out before I finish high school, I&#8217;ll be wearing them to high school. I doubt I&#8217;d be bullied. Tech is a status symbol in high school.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you live in the US, but things like this aren&#8217;t typically allowed in schools here.</p>
<p>Useless!? My lady says my 3.5&quot; is far from useless!</p>
<p>Too much info.  Whatever you do with your lady in the bedroom is between you two.</p>
<p>We got an Emily Post over here.</p>

<p>that&#8217;s impressive. can it scanas well , like goggles?</p>
<p>i meant scan, as well</p>
<p>I really can&#8217;t see a pair of gimpy techno-specs taking off. Maybe that&#8217;s just me though.</p>
<p>The same skepticism existed for many of the popular things we have today. Who knew I could have a mini computer in my pocket that connects me to <em>any</em> place in the world.</p>
<p>Key thing being in your pocket, not stuck in the middle of your face like a borg implant.<br />
Pretty important difference there.</p>
<p>Computer went from taking up whole rooms in buildings, to being on a tabletop to a lap to a pocket to a small device on the side of my head. Works better that way&#8230; camera is always eye-level and seeing what I&#8217;m seeing &#8212;  and it&#8217;s hand free!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s innovation, and moving technology forward.</p>
<p>There won&#8217;t ever be demand for more than, say, 5 cocmputers worldwide.</p>
<p>Easy decision if it means freeing up the hands and not having to look away to use it.  One example, imagine GPS navigation without having to take your eyes off the road.  Zing!  And, when they integrate it into regular looking sunglasses.  Zing Zing!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there will be a &#8220;focus threshold&#8221;, kind of like when you notice the glare on your TV.  You can&#8217;t un-see it, and it&#8217;s annoying.</p>
<p>Or you could just project the GPS display onto a small section of the windshield and not have to wear goggles while driving.</p>

<p>Ok, if that is the real interaction model then this is going to make bluetooth wearing douchebags look like the pinnacle of cool. So the process of taking a picture and sharing is:</p>
<p>1. Stare intently at someone or something<br />
2. Stare at the ceiling looking around<br />
3. Jerk your head around like you have a palsy</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see how this is definitely going to bring people together.</p>
<p>You do understand the term prototype, right?  If they feel that the current method they are trying out is no good, they will change it.</p>
<p>to much    <em><strong>Mi4</strong></em>    lately</p>
<p>too**</p>
<p>#fail</p>
<p>The whole interview is pretty cool.</p>
<p>looks like it taken from k300 o_o</p>
<p>I wish they showed us what he&#8217;s seeing.<br />
This is pretty exciting. Wonder if somebody out there is secretly preparing the &#8220;Brain Burst&#8221; program. ;-)</p>
<p>That picture looks like CRAP. Google, please figure out how to make optics like Apple does.</p>
<p>you mean samsung/sony optics?</p>
<p>Nope Ssheep</p>
<p>seriously&#8230;you are complaining about a prototype wearable computer&#8230;.that the camera isn&#8217;t good enough&#8230;.</p>
<p>i shouldn&#8217;t even have to say this, but i am sure the sensor will be upgraded once it is a viable product&#8230;right not, why throw a huge image sensor in there while they are testing it??? c&#8217;mon&#8230;use your head&#8230;.</p>
<p>(couldn&#8217;t edit my original comment)</p>
<p>the more likely excuse for your comment is just to take a jab at google&#8230;well done&#8230;.except it made you look stupid&#8230;.congrats!!</p>
<p>ooh you said he looks stupid, burn&#8230;</p>
<p>Look at the comment below.  It has Instagram filter built-in that Iusers rave about.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t make optics.</p>
<p>Looks like a lot of the photos I&#8217;m seeing on Instagram lately.</p>
<p>/ducks</p>
<p>wait until they release instagram for wp7</p>
<p>so let me get this straight.  There are comments all over the internet (including the verge commentors) on how google is a ad company. They dont innovate. yada yada.  They do crazy things like this, trying to get fiber optic internet  in the US, mining asteroids, self driving cars and people nit pick every single thing. &#8220;Lame.&#8221; &#8220;I dont see this working.&#8221; &#8220;The camera sucks.&#8221; Really people are complaining about a camera on a freaking wearable HUD thats a prototype. A WEARABLE HUD. There is no satisfying people.</p>
<p>Apple Retina invention is a greater contribution to mankind.</p>
<p>LG Retina Display. <strong>fixed</strong></p>
<p>like<br />
<strong>PS3 is manufactured by Asustek of Taiwan. X360 is manufactured by Winstron of Taiwan. PSP and Apple iPod are manufactured by Foxconn</strong></p>
<p>thats like saying Apple designs RAM and Samsung builds it. No these companies are suppliers.  If its Apple design why would LG sell the screen to other venders?  On the other hand Apple does design their own proceessors. <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2011/07/22/lg-display-ceo-retina-display-coming-to-ipad-non-apple-smartphones/" target="_blank">http://9to5mac.com/2011/07/22/lg-display-ceo-retina-display-coming-to-ipad-non-apple-smartphones/</a></p>
<p>Apple walks into a supplier and says &#8220;look, we need a product with _______. Heres 3 billion dollars upfront to upgrade your facilities, and in exchange we get priority on the first 15 million _________&#8217;s at this discounted price.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple may not design the parts, but their purchasing power pushes technology forward. New technology is expensive to produce and the initial cost is too high for most companies to build new parts that other companies cant initially afford. Apple&#8217;s huge, guaranteed demand overcomes this hurdle and the tech eventually trickles down to other companies.</p>
<p>I agree with everything you just said.  The whole &#8220;Apple invented X is just irritating.&#8221;</p>
<p>funny huh ? i only find you iriitating here, go look outside</p>
<p>If we go back to the original point then these glasses have a display that has a PPI several orders of magnitude higher than a retina display (which is what retina display is). These most likely have a screen with a PPI of approximately 2272 compared to the iPhones 326. This is because the screen must fit in the glasses and is then magnified.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t bother explaining him</p>
<p>There is no invention&#8230; DOHH!! &#8230;.</p>
<p>Well tomorrow Im going to create a perpetual energy machine solving all the worlds energy problems, create a new form of transportation, and re-engineer a T-Rex to only be 2&#8217; tall so I can keep it as my personal pet.</p>
<p>Talking about stuff you MIGHT do in the future is pointless. You can work on a project for 100 years, but if it never functions or comes to fruition its just media attention. Until Google takes off into space or any consumer can purchase a wearable HUD or self-driving car, its all fantasy. He took a picture with a massive gadget plastered to his face, for all we know that is its only function.</p>
<blockquote>Talking about stuff you MIGHT do</blockquote><p>Except they&#8217;re not just talking, they&#8217;re doing the hardware engineering and software dev to make it work. Seriously, why would they be showing it if all they managed to do was mount a digital camera sensor on an earpeice?<p>Do you honestly mean to tell us that you  think all the Google X employees, on basically a personal project of Sergey Brin, have been working for over a year, to have <em>only</em> accomplished a prototype that does nothing more than take a photo?<p>Absurd. Your comment is absurd and you are absurd. Come back when you have a prototype of something. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s a toaster. But then I doubt you could splice a switch onto a length of extension cord.</p></p></p>
<p>Sergey Brin himself said that currently &#8220;you really just see [them] reboot.&#8221; We have never seen any ACTUAL images of the OS or what functionality they provide, everything has been rendered. This guy nods his head and it takes a picture and uploads it automatically, without any other interaction? And you blindly believe they have a fully working OS like the rendered movie you saw???</p>
<p>You&#8217;re an absurd fanboy. When companies are doing well they dont need to announce pet projects that might work eventually&#8230;someday&#8230;hopefully. Back in 1993 the media said we would have hoverboards and be in flying cars within 15 years, companies were &#8220;hard at work on it&#8221;. How&#8217;d that work out? Everything I own still has stone-age wheels.</p>
<p>When a company announces a product I can purchase and physically test out, Ill give all their efforts credit, but until then everything else is just vaporware.</p>
<p>And you believed Brin, I guess, because corporate execs always tell the full truth about products in the pipeline, and never joke about anything.<p>I&#8217;ve seen no video. Whether Google lives or dies I don&#8217;t care (although I&#8217;d hate to lose Gmail), and I&#8217;m not going to speculate about what the prototype does or doesn&#8217;t do, nor what they should or shouldn&#8217;t announce. But you are seriously an idiot. <p><blockquote>When a company announces a product I can purchase and physically test out, Ill give all their efforts credit, but until then everything else is just vaporware.</blockquote><p>So then the next iPhone is vaporware right? Windows 8 RT, defo vaporware.<p>/S. Point is, I know enough about Google&#8217;s policy of investing resources into things that don&#8217;t make money but that <em>could</em> make money in the future, along with their current stress on the opposite—trimming the fat—and general behaviors of corporate governance, to make a pretty good guess about where they&#8217;re at with this tech. I admit it&#8217;s guessing. While you&#8217;re making pointless, retarded complaints about a product about which you know nothing concrete, and is far beyond anything you could hope to do on your own or even your ability to fully comprehend. And we all know what that kind of behavior is called. 0/10.</p></p></p></p></p>

<p>Im no english major, but you might want to look up the word speculate in the dictionary. I simply questioned what the device could or could not do at this point, and because your <em>speculation</em> of how much the device is able to do at this point differs from mine, I got called an idiot&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>I know enough about Google’s policy of investing resources into things that don’t make money but that could make money in the future, along with their current stress on the opposite—trimming the fat—and general behaviors of corporate governance, to make a pretty good guess about where they’re at with this tech.</blockquote>
<p>You do realize that after all the markets google has attempted to enter, 98% of their revenue still comes from the one thing they started with, search &amp; advertising. Im glad you&#8217;re so knowledgeable to know what projects will become successful and generate profit for Google in the future, because whoevers in charge thought Google Wave, Buzz, Coupons, Jaiku, Notebook, and to a certain extent Google+ &amp; Chrome OS were going to be massive successes. Maybe they should hire you on as a consultant to help run the company!</p>
<blockquote>So then the next iPhone is vaporware right?</blockquote>
<p>Yes, no matter what rumor you hear, the only people that know what the next iPhone will entail are the people working inside Apple. Ive heard it will have a 4&quot; screen, haptic feedback, 4G, and a virtual girlfriend function, but until Apple <em>announces it for consumers</em> its all just speculation and as I said, vaporware.</p>
<blockquote>I admit it’s guessing. While you’re making pointless, retarded complaints about a product about which you know nothing concrete, and is far beyond anything you could hope to do on your own or even your ability to fully comprehend. </blockquote>
<p>So you admit you&#8217;re guessing, and then chastize me for complaining about a product without concrete facts. Arent you just praising a product which you also know <strong>nothing</strong> about, while resorting to childish name calling to emphasize your superiority over me?</p>
<p>I humbly bow before you, ooh mighty omniscient being. My <em>absurd idiocy</em> knows no bounds, and you have shown me the light with your resplendent intellect and foresight. I award myself no points, and may god have mercy on my soul.</p>
<p><strong>/S</strong></p>
<p>Not sure how to respond to all this rambling other than to say ok, yes essentially we&#8217;re both using &#8220;burden of proof&#8221; arguments. But with what&#8217;s shown in this article, plus a bit of induction (which I detailed), I can say—yes <em>without</em> speculating—that I am certain that there is something Google&#8217;s working on here that does more than take grainy photos. Whether or not it ever makes them any money is irrelevant to that conclusion, and personally irrelevant to me.<p>Also I have said nothing praising this thing, only that there&#8217;s demonstrably more to this product than just talk, which was your wildly counterfactual premise that got me mad at you. Then you stated that anything you can&#8217;t see or touch for yourself doesn&#8217;t, for all intents and purposes, exist, which (unless we&#8217;re going to start discussing ontology) is asinine and which angered me further. I apologize for the name calling, I&#8217;m usually not this big a dick, but please realize you sounded like a very backwards person.</p></p>
<p>a working prototype is here now. Doesnt matter if it will be sold to consumers or not. It maybe used by the military.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to eat your words sooner than later.</p>

<p>Thank you kind sir, finally a fan of Louis CK who also feels my exact sentiment towards all of this.</p>
<p>That Louis C.K. bit can be posted in every comment thread here. It&#8217;s a little sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;But its in Beta!<br />
But its Free!<br />
But its attached to your glasses!<br />
But its Geek Chic!<br />

<p>But it&#8217;s a Troll!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to look back at what Sebastian is doing and put him at the same level as other great innovators. Really bringing the future too us in ways few thought was possible.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only a small lens on top of the right eye right?  Our focus has to be set at infinity in order to see the AR popups?</p>
<p>The idiocy level in the comment section is mind blowing. Most of you people are so out of place here. How can anyone but cheer at something like this?</p>
<p>If anyone&#8217;s read Transmetropolitan, you&#8217;re probably having the same WANT reaction as me for a pair with one red circle lens, and one green rectangle lens.</p>
<p>Awesomeness</p>
<p>I get that it&#8217;s a prototype device, but the crappiest cameras in the crappiest cell phones take better photos than that&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>In a quick exchange, Brin tells Newsom how he just took a photo without his interviewer even noticing</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that won&#8217;t cause any problems at all when this is released next year.</p>
<p>Why would it?</p>
<p>There is a certain creep factor but lets face it, its not like you aren&#8217;t wearing a big red flag by wearing these things in the first place. There is no legal argument to be made.</p>
<p>In other news: What an awful quote, I&#8217;m sure the marketing department are crying right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making any legal arguments.  Just commenting on the creep factor.</p>
<p>Yeah there is that, although I believe this is the future. Not specifically this but this in contact lenses. This is total augmented reality immersion, or at least the stepping stone to it. This will eventually be the ability to look at a building and learn its history, whats in there, how tall it is, what its made out of etc. Couple all that with the new AIs that Apple and Google are working on that learn from you to be personal to you and you got yourself a science fiction novel and its not that far out there.</p>
<p>Soooo my point is that which that kind of augmented reality its going to be really crossing the creep line. For example is your facebook picture your face? Well thats public information that can be shown in a google search. Google can use this information to link your face to a facebook profile, or more ideally from their point of view, a google+ profile.</p>
<p>Suddenly you know everybodys name, age, place of work and country of residence by just looking at them.</p>
<p>I think this is something that is going to seem normal eventually. Just like people found the internet and the phone book creepy when they first came out.</p>
<p>Soooo my point is that with*</p>
<p>I have to laugh when people get upset about the creep factor, yet they post online to public profiles on &#8216;free&#8217; social media sites. They are, by using the social media sites, giving away their rights to any sort of online privacy (and really, we all know privacy on the internet is moot).</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time people got smart to how the internet is a larger part of their lives than they truly realize.</p>
<p>Yeah it&#8217;s a bit daft but social media has an illusion of privacy and that comforts people. People can be stupid all they want but the &#8220;creep factor&#8221; is still an issue for google if they want to shift units.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much of a problem with it like I&#8217;ve already stated but people are going to be seriously creeped out by a device that is constantly monitoring the environment and recognising people&#8217;s faces. In reality this technology totally exists already. I can take a picture of your face, pop it into google image search and say search of similar images. It&#8217;s probably going to return personal information to you. But there&#8217;s a difference in people&#8217;s minds with that and having a real time thing that you wear. I know so many people that would be utterly freaked out by this. I am kind of the oh they know your name, so what? Camp but I feel I&#8217;m unusual in this regard.</p>
<p>Well we can be unusual together. I actually am of the mindset that if you want privacy, don&#8217;t post anything online that&#8217;s private. Essentially, keep your private life private. That&#8217;s why I have no issues having all my online profiles public. My private life stays off the internet (for the most part).</p>
<p>About the creep factor, yeah I hear you. I think there will always be a deep seated fear of loss of privacy (the illusion really, like you stated) when really people don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;ve already lost their privacy.</p>
<p>I choose what pictures i put online and who can see them.</p>
<p>People can&#8217;t take photos of me without me knowing.</p>
<p>People can take photos of you without you knowing. However, they might also not know they&#8217;ve taken a photo of you (you end up in the background of their picture, walking). In either case, people can and will take photos of you without you knowing. They might even take photos of you right in front of you and call it street photography (you usually can request not to have your picture posted after <strong>nicely</strong> talking with the photographer). You&#8217;ve gotta just live with it.</p>

<p><em>Leave me alone, I try very hard!</em></p>
<p>&gt;:[</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry. At least I didn&#8217;t say &#8216;the word&#8217;.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you even&#8230;</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you people just use SkyDrive!?</p>
<p>I do use SkyDrive! 25GB FTW.</p>
<p>I can take a picture of you with my smartphone without you noticing, and then covertly slip it back into my pocket. This is less creepy.</p>
<p>I can and I will!</p>
<p>Or your phone&#8230;?</p>
<p>Word, no bueno on the creep factor.</p>
<p>No more creepy than a professional photographer taking public pictures. Or tourists taking pictures.</p>
<p>In a public place, you have no expectation of privacy.</p>
<p>Legally, you won&#8217;t be allowed to use them in high security jobs.</p>
<p>Or potentially at movie theaters.</p>
<p>what if you could get them as prescription and they are my only pair.. will they make me quit my job or leave the theater?</p>
<p>What if you where prescribed a walking cane and the only one you had available was a rifle you used as a walking cane? Should you be allowed to take it wherever you want?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wanna get into the whole thing but come on dude &#8211; a rifle is just a tiny bit different from glasses that can take a photo.</p>
<p>A bad analogy but if you&#8217;re doing that sort of job, you should know what using these glasses entails.</p>
<p>Likely if your job requires you to connect to an exchange server for email, then the IT people in your company can prevent your devices from taking photo&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Same way that they do it currently with high tech devices for people in sensitive positions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an analogy. The point isn&#8217;t that a rifle and glasses are the same thing. The point is that certain objects are banned in certain areas, if you make the decision to use one of these banned items as a medical aid that&#8217;s your problem. If your only pair of glasses are glasses that are capable of taking pictures and are thereby banned anywhere that cameras are banned then that&#8217;s your problem for buying camera glasses as your only pair of glasses (just like it would be your problem for deciding to use a rifle as a walking stick).</p>
<p>Albeit a weak one, and the point isn&#8217;t strongly made; also, an analogy isn&#8217;t a legitimate argument if you want to really get down into it.</p>
<p>Just turn the glasses off? Or, you know, buy a cheap standard pair and keep it in your bag.</p>
<p>Jesus. </p>
<p>What if you were prescribed TWO walking canes, and BOTH of them were rifles!?</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>Also, your hearing aid is a SHARK.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 3.5em; font-weight: normal;">♥</strong></p>
<p>What kind of question is this. They are allowed to kick you out of the theatre for anything they want pretty much. As for the job in Europe they need to give you a warning but they are entitled to give you a warning based on dress code, it happens all the time which is what this would be. They are allowed fire you for whatever really once its a non discriminatory rule and they give you adequate warning.</p>
<p>Many states in the US have this as well (Here in Colorado, they call it &#8216;at-will employment&#8217;).</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know how they would handle such a critical situation like that. However, if you are making 100k+ (which every security job I&#8217;ve applied for was paying at the very minimum) then they would basically force you to buy new glasses.</p>
<p>Movies, I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;d just deny you entrance (if they noticed).</p>
<p>All I can tell you is that iPad 1s are highly desirable in the security industry because they have no camera and will allow you to do things like read books during your down time. (like when you are on assignment in a &#8220;secure&#8221; area)</p>
<p>yes.. maybe.. <br />
in theaters there are a lot of big ugly sign saying &#8220;you carry a camera? I will kick you out&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well legally they can ban watches from high security jobs or movie theatres. Its their property, as long as it doesn&#8217;t infringe on people&#8217;s rights they are allowed do whatever they want legally. So thats kind of a mute point but I get what you are saying.</p>
<p>Better than the picture I took with my eyes&#8230;</p>
<p>Most &#8220;geniuses&#8221; are not just smart, but they also have very accurate memories, sometimes even photographic.</p>
<p>Most memories, even on a genius level, aren&#8217;t fully photographic — though, there have been a few recorded exceptions like Kim Peek or Temple Grandin, who both also happen to be autistic.</p>
<p>Most geniuses have terrible memories. I don&#8217;t know where you pulled this statistic from but history is littered with geniuses who had terrible memories. Leonardo, Newton, Einstein.</p>
<p>No creepier than putting your own photo&#8217;s on Facebook or any other social network that anyone can potentially see</p>
<p>Really? Some random person taking pictures of you with their glasses isn&#8217;t creepier than your personal choice to upload your own pictures to your own social network account?</p>
<p>correct.</p>
<p>its not like this doesn&#8217;t already happen/cant already happen.</p>
<p>I think most people (including me and I don&#8217;t see much of an issue with people taking pictures of me as I walk down the street) would disagree with both of ye but whatever.</p>
<p>Correct. I mean depending on your privacy settings and how strict you are on accepting friend requests, a lot of people could gain access to 10s, 100s, or 1000s of your photos. Random people looking at those photos is just as creepy as random people taking your photos.</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p>One is you choosing what to share, and with whom.</p>
<p>The other is someone else recording you without your permission.</p>
<p>Fundamental difference.</p>
<p>You are in a public place, and they are viewing publicly available information.  You have no right to prevent somebody from taking a picture when you are walking around the mall, or any other public place. Nor any right to prevent people from having access to freely available information.</p>
<p>You are creating a straw man argument.  People record you without your permission probably numerous times a day on security camera&#8217;s and traffic camera&#8217;s and probably even camera phones.</p>
<p>Yes but its people perceived privacy that we are talking about. You can say that until you are blue in the face and everyone here will likely agree with you but that doesn&#8217;t mean that the public won&#8217;t be creeped out by a device like this (they will) and your logical argument does not mean its not a problem for google when they try and shift units.</p>
<p>As for his point it is totally valid. Somebody taking pictures of you, whether it be with this device or google glass is more creepy than you sharing your OWN pictures on your OWN terms by your OWN personal choice on your OWN social media site.</p>
<p>So it comes down to &#8220;I know you&#8217;ve made a logical argument and you&#8217;re completely right that there are no legal issues and it&#8217;s really no creepier than a photographer taking public pictures, but I&#8217;m going to continue to hammer my point&#8221;</p>
<p>No its: the world does not think like you so look beyond your own nose.</p>
<p>Your matter doesn&#8217;t matter to google. Your opinion does not shift units. Regular Joes&#8217; opinions shift units and they will fine this creepy.</p>
<p>copernicus called buddy ;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular Joes’ opinions shift units and they will fine this creepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m sure many people thought this when Facebook first came out. But then it became ordinary. Heck, people seem to have completely gotten over the atrocity that is the Patriot Act.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re making an assertion that isn&#8217;t backed up by anything. Most likely, there will be a split, like there is today with social networks and the internet in general. Some people will find it creepy and far more people will wonder how they lived without it (and of course the vast majority will find it merely interesting and possibly useful).</p>
<p>THIS JUST IN: Facebook was NOT the first social network</p>
<p>say whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?</p>
<p>No, but Myspace and the myriad of sites that came before were hardly something that one&#8217;s parents were on. Facebook is the first truly ubiquitous social network.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s still almost exclusively young people actually but whatever. It&#8217;s a stupid analogy. You are comparing something that grew in a very niche set of circumstances to be huge before people even thought about the creep factor. You are comparing a free fad hat some college kids had that rapidly grew out of control to a luxury device that is going to cost real money. It&#8217;s not a fad, it needs to be useful and it needs to make people want to purchase it. Just because the other dorm is doing it won&#8217;t be enough to shift these units. They need something compelling and keep the creep factor low if this will work.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the media shitstorm that&#8217;s waiting to happen here? Oh look, buy these glasses and google is always watching you and what you do.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it creepy that every laptop has a camera on it? Microsoft is obviously watching everything you do! HP, Apple, and Acer too!</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t google.</p>
<p>Really? Because that&#8217;s not exactly true. People (friends, family, friends of friends etc) can put up photos of you on social networks and tag them without your permission.</p>
<p>Secondly how many people actually change their privacy settings or understand the consequences of doing so? Or how many friends of yours know or set their privacy settings (who possess photos of you)?</p>
<p>They cant tag without your permission.</p>
<p>Most people change their privacy settings actually. My news feed is a cluttered mess of complaints whenever Facebook &#8220;simplifies&#8221; their privacy settings. I&#8217;ve noticed people I know using lists a lot now as well.</p>
<p>Ok they can&#8217;t tag but they can upload photos of you, and it can still be seen as creepy that unknown people can look at photos of you on your various social networks or your friends social network. Which was my original point.</p>
<p>Personally from my research into privacy it seems that people are unaware of what privacy entails and how public the internet is (in relation to their personal data) and what it means.</p>
<p>cops are going to hate this, if they see you wearing one when pulling you over, you&#8217;ll get a beating by default.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll be banned driving, they impair your vision. Just like bluetooth headsets are banned here, they impair your hearing.</p>
<p>Yes&#8230; Also loud music in cars&#8230; oh wait.</p>
<p>The legal argument is loud music is not physically impairing your hearing. Bluetooth headsets actually physically block the ear which is the issue. In reality if they could ban loud music they could.</p>
<p>Wearing headphones or earbuds is illegal. Loud music can be illegal if it &#8216;disturbs the peace&#8217;. It&#8217;s often just not worth police officer&#8217;s time.</p>
<p><img src="http://themetapicture.com/media/funny-Lion-King-circle-of-life.jpg" /></p>
<p>You think people dont snap pics of you and you don&#8217;t know it?! There&#8217;s a high probability that there&#8217;s a meme out there on the net with your face on it without your knowledge&#8230;.</p>
<p>Mainly a problem for good looking people, they are going to have more people checking them out for longer periods to get the recordings</p>
<blockquote>Unfortunately, Brin confirmed that we&#8217;re still a long ways off from seeing Project Glass as a shipping project, saying, &#8220;I have some hopes to maybe get it out sometime next year.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s still pretty close, given how advanced this technology appears to be.</p>
<p>I wish we knew how advanced the tech actually is. They are being very hush. Taking pictures isn&#8217;t terribly innovative and thats all they have demonstrated yet :/</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4</a></p>
<p>All computer generated, thats a concept video not actual practise. For a product like this the goalposts get moved constantly. While those videos are interesting you certainly can&#8217;t be expecting what is in them to come true with any degree of confidence.</p>
<p>If the actual product falls short of the stuff in that video, the only reaction will be disappointment.  Why get everyone&#8217;s hopes up so high?</p>
<p>Not really, most people don&#8217;t know about that video because they aren&#8217;t tech nuts like us and even tech nuts like us will likely have forgotten that video by the time this product eventually surfaces. Why release the concept video? To try and get people at ease with the concept of wearing this ridiculous looking stuff and the &#8220;creep factor&#8221;</p>
<p>They are trying to &#8220;mainstream&#8221; the concept well in advance so people voice all of their concerns before the actual product unveil.</p>
<p>A lot of people know about it in my school, lol.</p>
<p>Tech Nut High School? Or Tech Nut University?</p>
<p>so you are saying that if they video shows a man making ice cream, that we shouldnt expect ice cream but rather some dairy product?</p>
<p>Thats an awful analogy but I&#8217;ll try to work with it. I am saying if they show a video of a new amazing ice cream with sprinkles and 99s and all the flavours of the rainbow in a concept video (ie. not the real thing) you shouldn&#8217;t expect that but some generic whipped ice cream. It will almost never be what they described, it could be worse, it could be better but the video was a concept.</p>
<p>Taking pictures is not very innovative, you are right. But taking pictures with a camera embedded in a pair of glasses that uses eye movement to navigate the UI is very innovative. I am not sure you understand what innovation is.</p>
<blockquote>I am not sure you understand what innovation is</blockquote>
<p>Yup that must be it, I don&#8217;t understand. Good job Holmes, you solved another one.</p>
<p>I had an exchange with someone who tried on a pair of the Project Glass prototype hardware on G+. Currently, he said, they have voice control, social media search, and web search up and running.</p>
<p>Ok interesting. Wonder how well voice control works with the microphone so far from your mouth and in a busy environment. I see is as a big problem, also I would much rather not be talking to myself in a public place. I don&#8217;t do it with my phone I&#8217;m certainly not going to do it with my glasses.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting that in these interviews Brin seems to be using eye tracking and head tilts almost exclusively? How reliable is your source?</p>
<p>It may be that they have voice control technically working, but maybe it isn&#8217;t ready for demoing.  Issues as you stated might be things they are still working out.</p>
<p>Possibly, however it wasn&#8217;t working when that video was made. That video is a run of the mill look what this product <em>might/could</em> be.</p>
<p>As for the problem I mentioned I don&#8217;t see how they can solve them, its a fundamental problem with voice based assistants since the dawn of voice based assistants and is the sole reason I would never use Siri or Google Assistant. They just don&#8217;t work in noisy environments which is when I would want to use them so I don&#8217;t see the point. I don&#8217;t know how you solve that and obviously nobody else does considering how old voice tech is and it still hasn&#8217;t been solved.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been some hubbub about it possibly being a bone-based microphone system, <em>a la</em> whatever Jawbone product it was that did it.</p>
<p>My &#8220;source&#8221; is particularly reliable, he has pictures of himself using the hardware and being at the Google Glass Walk on G+. Really, all I did was message someone I saw using it on the internet, it really makes you wonder why some of these tech blogs can&#8217;t do the same.</p>
<p>They can but they need to verify their sources, if they get it wrong they are discredited. You don&#8217;t have that problem. If you are wrong you are just another wrong guy on the internet.</p>
<p>Next year? There goes my Christmas plans. :(</p>
<p>Oh well, there will be plenty of Nexus devices released this fall that you can pick for Christmas.</p>
<p>I have a phone that works though. At the moment, my glasses are being held together by a paper clip that I found on the floor.</p>
<p>lol I&#8217;m holding out on buying glasses to see what this has in store&#8230;</p>
<p>You should start asking for a raise. Perhaps take a second job. Maybe project glass shouldn&#8217;t be a priority when a paper clip is critical to your functioning in society :P</p>
<p>That may be the greatest comment that I have ever read. I would take your advice, but I am an unemployed boarding school student and I get to go home on Friday. When I escape, I will pop into Specsavers and get them sorted.</p>
<p>So, when can we expect Sergey to be a guest on &#8220;On The Verge&#8221; so we can get the Verge team&#8217;s impressions of how well the technology works, and maybe hear a little more about it from the man himself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine The Verge are waiting until they have something to new to announce otherwise its a non-story.</p>
<p>You think Sergey Brin being a guest would be a non-story?</p>
<p>Nope but if Brin comes on he is going to be expected to say something new about it and he likely won&#8217;t agree to that, at least not yet.</p>
<p>There will be a lot of disappointment if Brin came on and said nothing new.</p>
<p>Getting a hands on with any proto-type is a story. I don&#8217;t know what world you are living in.</p>
<p>its a world that doesnt end in &#8220;erg&#8221; but starts with end&#8230;</p>
<p>lol ok, ask Josh why Brin hasn&#8217;t been on On The Verge yet so.</p>
<p>I actually spoke to a young man who had tried on the Project Glass prototype hardware during the walk that they had. He said that there was, at the moment, voice control, &#8220;social media search&#8221;, and some measure of Google Search. I found the last bit surprising, since it seemed like it would be difficult to format results in a way that fits with Glasses usage.<br />
What I&#8217;m curious about is logging on to one&#8217;s Google account on the device. Maybe some kind of five-minute scannable QR code that one can pull up on one&#8217;s computer? For those without Android phones, of course.</p>
<p>This will be an android complement not a stand alone device. I am 90% certain of that. You can&#8217;t go sticking microwaves that close to a brain so the phone function that they are showing off is obviously paired to your android device in your pocket. Plus it just makes sense.</p>
<p>Of course you can. Just get the right FCC documentation in there and you can stick Wifi/BT4 in the dev ice. How do you think it&#8217;s going to communicate, IR?</p>
<p>Besides, if they ever went for cell radio cert., it wouldn&#8217;t be too hard. People use their cellphones next to their heads all the time. Maybe less, now, with the smartphone paradigm, but still to communicate. All you need to do is turn off the antenna when you&#8217;re not using it, or only flash it every few seconds for notification check.</p>
<p>Wifi or BT, not cell which is what I meant. It has been proven to interfere with cognitive processes which is one of reasons talking on the phone while driving causes so many accidents. Its not the one ear blocked or one hand off the wheel so much as peoples reaction times being drastically lower due to the microwaves changing in frequency and strength and they jump from tower to tower. We don&#8217;t know the long term effects of this sort of exposure and until we do people are going to air on the side of caution.</p>
<p>On top of that consideration there is power consumption and price points to consider. This device needs to be as cheap as possible. Use BT4 with an android device and you get low power consumption and allow most of the processing to be done on the phone and lower the weight and price of the glasses which are now just a tiny screen, some sensors and a speaker.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t contain a cell radio, I&#8217;d bet my house on it.</p>
<p>Google glasses plus Bluetooth earpiece = ultimate tool</p>
<p>I would imagine it contains an earpiece, a bone conductive one would be discrete and work very well and save space.</p>
<p>if the final design doesn&#8217;t resemble normal glasses, it will become the new pocket protector.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t need a Bluetooth earpiece obviously. The device will be multi-functional: phone, AI assistant, camera, Navigation, AR, and so on.</p>
<p>it won&#8217;t be a phone. Might pair to your phone but it won&#8217;t be a phone. In fact its likely to be just a display that pairs to your android.</p>
<p>I believe Brin said that they&#8217;re working hard to try to make it a standalone device with connectivity, but that they (of course) had nothing to announce at that time.</p>
<p>Citation needed</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed at how much their disclosing on Project Glass.  If Apple has anything going on along the same lines there is no way we would hear about it until it releases.  Maybe they just don&#8217;t want Apple saying that Google copied themif Apple releases something first with Google shortly after.  Google has put a stake in the ground that they were here first by revealing what they have.  Since Google is not really a product company, but a services company, it does not really hurt them to reveal stuff on the product side of things but it garners some pretty big PR marks for Google as an innovator.  I don&#8217;t expect Google to start disclosing their search ranking algorithms any time soon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s different and it&#8217;s bad.</p>
<p>Google entered that kind of evolvement (as any other big companies like MS) when they create future products but rarely release them.<br />
It&#8217;s like those MS&#8217; video of future ten years ahead.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly sure they&#8217;ll release these unless the entire tech behind them falls over. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ve invested a lot in it already.</p>
<p>Also, they&#8217;d have to contend with loads of angry nerds (like me) if they don&#8217;t release it. Hell hath no fury like a nerd scorned.</p>
<p>Microsoft usually just releases videos. This is an actual prototype. I doubt they are going to backtrack on it, and say next year: &#8220;you know what, we&#8217;re actually not going to release it&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like same story as Google Car, they have the technology and it&#8217;s working, but they won&#8217;t release any cars pretty soon.</p>
<p>Just for my thinking it looks too unrealistic:<br />
- such glasses are just geeks&#8217; niche, usual people won&#8217;t wear it.<br />
Google is not Apple, they can&#8217;t create fashion thing.<br />
- battery issues<br />
- weight issues<br />
- eye issues</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>Google has partnered with car manufacturers to create self-driving cars.</p>
<p>in nevada they&#8217;re starting real tests on these cars&#8230; on real roads&#8230; with real people&#8230;</p>
<p>As opposed to fake tests with fake roads with fake people?</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>I feel like they are trying build hype./ Like you said they are not really a product company.  Look how many stories are being posted everytime someone shows up wearing them. I also think they are gauging consumer reaction and feedback. Just my 2 cents.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s strategically incredibly stupid to give the market such a long heads up with constant demos. . . if its a product that anyone cares about. But this will fail so Google doesn&#8217;t care if anyone knows. Can you imagine giving an 18 month heads up on the iPad?</p>
<p>They do the same with movies and video games.  Announce them well in advance of the release.  I don&#8217;t see the problem with this.  They&#8217;re building up hype.</p>
<p>Who knows, they could be throwing everyone for a loop and announce that it&#8217;ll be released around Christmas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a completely new product, they are trying to get people at ease with the principle. Just like everybody knew what the iPhone was going to be before it was announced and everybody knew what the iPad was going to be before it was announced.</p>
<p>Difference is Apple does controlled leaks and google does concept videos. Two different methods of doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Really?  &#8220;Everyone&#8221;?  iPad and iPhone surprised the market. Companies are still trying to catch up.</p>
<p>Go back and look at the media coverage, people knew there was going to be an iPad announcement and people knew what it was going to be. Just the same with the iPhone. I read about it in a NYT article of all places weeks before any word from apple.</p>
<p>Companies aren&#8217;t still trying to catch up. The difference between something like the GNex and the iPhone 4 are largely opinion based not technicality based. Same goes for tablets, there&#8217;s lots of tablets out there that are technically superior to the iPad and companies are still struggling to penetrate that market. I&#8217;m not sure why, an ICS tablet is actually pretty good at this stage. Brand loyality I guess.</p>
<p>Anyways with the exception of Microsoft everybody has caught up and have been quite a while. It&#8217;s a personal preference thing.</p>
<p>Sure, there were rumors.  No one had any idea what either product would look like or how it would work before they were revealed.</p>
<p>Yes, companies are still trying to catch up.  The latest ICS phones are getting close, but don&#8217;t have the ecosystem yet that Apple enjoys (close, but not quite there).  And Android tablets are still not popular.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to recreate the hardware (ask the Samsung copy machine).  But making the entire experience is much more difficult and no one has yet caught up.  The profit numbers don&#8217;t lie.</p>
<blockquote>Sure, there were rumors. No one had any idea what either product would look like or how it would work before they were revealed.</blockquote>
<p>Completely false. Everybody knew that the iPhone was going to be a buttonless touch screen internet enabled phone. No such phone existed at the time. I knew it was going to be that before the unveil. The ipad? Everybody knew it was going to be a large iPhone type product, dya not remember everyone saying oh its just a big iPod touch, its going to fail. That was before the announcement, a while before the announcement in fact.</p>
<blockquote>Yes, companies are still trying to catch up. The latest ICS phones are getting close, but don’t have the ecosystem yet that Apple enjoys</blockquote>
<p>Completely personal opinion. Their ecosystems are not comparable. I am quite locked into the Google garden, I use all the google services and my university is a google apps customer. An android phone has a VASTLY superior ecosytem for me. It may be that Apples ecosystem works better for you but you need to realise it doesn&#8217;t for everyone. Also as a side note if we were to compare them on paper Android has more ecosystem tie ins than Apple. They have their own social network, instant photo online back up, free online streaming of 20,000 songs, fluid online contact management and back up, excellent location and maps integration, android beam for sharing information among two devices etc and all of this is deeply integrated into the OS.</p>
<p>I still personally feel its a opinion thing because Apple&#8217;s system isn&#8217;t bad I am just making the point that on paper Android is superior.</p>
<blockquote> Android tablets are still not popular.</blockquote>
<p>This is true, I&#8217;m not sure why, its not a technical fault. I think it may be that cheap android tablets have ruined peoples opinions of them?</p>
<blockquote>It’s easy to recreate the hardware (ask the Samsung copy machine)</blockquote>
<p>Actually its incredibly difficult. So difficult that Sammy are the only ones that do it in fact. I hate Sammy for doing it but the fact is you need to actually have a massive R&amp;D team and tonnes of capital to copy something someone else did all the while attempting to avoid the very broad patents that the other company has. It is actually easier to create your own product but Sammy prefer to have a deceitful marketing strategy and it seems to work for them. Other android OEMs don&#8217;t copy though, they aren&#8217;t particularly brave in their designs but they don&#8217;t copy.</p>
<blockquote>But making the entire experience is much more difficult and no one has yet caught up.</blockquote>
<p>Stock ICS is NOTHING like iOS. WP7 is NOTHING like iOS. Both are relatively succesful in their own regards. Android in particular. Android own the smartphone market don&#8217;t forget. You can argue market saturation all you want but people are on their second smartphone now and they still stuck with android so thats a testement to people enjoying a DIFFERENT experience and choosing it over Apple.</p>
<blockquote>The profit numbers don’t lie.</blockquote>
<p>Profit numbers are one of the worst metrics that you can use to compare this market. Android is open source with all the OEMs in compeition. Competition ALWAYS means less profit for both parties. iOS only has one OEM so every iOS unit sold is at maximum profit. You need to consider that Android is a massive microeconomy in itself. It can&#8217;t be compared to iOS in terms of profit for the individual OEMs. Units sold are a better metric although far from perfect.</p>
<blockquote>Profit numbers are one of the worst metrics that you can use to compare this market</blockquote>
<p>Tell that to Motorola (failed), RIM (failing), and Nokia (failing). Rim and Nokia in particular had good volume, but no profits.  if you don&#8217;t make money it&#8217;s not sustainable.</p>
<blockquote> Android own the smartphone market don’t forget.</blockquote>
<p>Define &#8220;own&#8221;.  Considering iPhone is outselling (all of) them on the three major US carriers now, that&#8217;s not a good sign.</p>
<p>Considering Moto was bought by the creator of Android I would be VERY hesitant to say they failed. In fact moto makes some excellent products and once Google fires them up I&#8217;d imagine we will see some kick ass products out of them again.</p>
<p>RIM failed because they failed to adapt, Nokia also failed to adapt but they are embracing WP7 now and they are likely to pick up ground again. The losses of those two companies are because they were both massive monopolistic companies that underestimated the Apple/Google threat. It has nothing at all to do with profit margains.</p>
<p>I am using &#8220;own&#8221; as a phrase to mean dominating the smartphone market. The iPhone is NOT outselling Android by any stretch of the imagination. The iPhone is outselling particular phone models within android but thats not a fair comparison because we are comparing iOS (all of the sales are distributed among one product) and Android (all of the sales are distributed among hundreds of products.</p>
<p>They are not readily comparable hardware wise but if we look at software wise Android is continuing to dominate iOS.</p>
<blockquote>Considering Moto was bought by the creator of Android I would be VERY hesitant to say they failed.</blockquote>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t Google by Samsung?  Because they are profitable.  Motorola was/is bleeding money, that&#8217;s why they were an acquisition target.</p>
<p>It absolutely has to do with profits.  If you don&#8217;t make profits, you can&#8217;t succeed.  It&#8217;s simple math, especially when your competition does make money (Apple, Samsung).</p>
<p>I use &#8220;own&#8221; to mean dominating the smartphone market also, and iPhone &#8220;owns&#8221; the market.  Apple has 75% profit share and rising.  They also dominate revenue shares compared too ALL Android makers.</p>
<p>And, in the US, iPhone is outselling ALL Android phones combined at the three largest carriers.</p>
<p>The iPhone &#8220;owns&#8221; the market by most definitions.</p>
<p>No Google bought Moto because they were threatening to sue other OEMs. But that fact that they haven&#8217;t sold them again and the fact that they have a past history of making past hardware means Google considers them an asset.</p>
<blockquote>It absolutely has to do with profits. If you don’t make profits, you can’t succeed. </blockquote>
<p>Yes but the amount of profit you are making is NOT a metric for success in this industry.</p>
<blockquote>I use "own" to mean dominating the smartphone market also, and iPhone "owns" the market.</blockquote>
<p>Samsung is approaching 60% of smartphone marketshare with android far above that. iPhone doesn&#8217;t &#8220;own&#8221; anything other than marketing abilities.</p>
<blockquote>And, in the US, iPhone is outselling ALL Android phones combined at the three largest carriers.</blockquote>
<p>I refer you to my last point. iOS is NOT outselling Android, not by a long shot. Which is the metric you should be using because we are comparing platforms here not manufacteurs or devices.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to give sources because even including Bada I can&#8217;t find anything that indicates Samsung has over 40% worldwide.</p>
<p>Are there any doubts that  he is making some kind of Iron Man suit under Googleplex?</p>
<p>So how well is that going to work for the ~60% of persons over 16 years of age that have to wear corrective lenses? It would have to be a clip-on solution to be attractive to this majority&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been stated multiple times that they&#8217;re working on versions that work with prescription glasses. The other solution is just to wear contacts.</p>
<p>the killer app Brin hasn&#8217;t disclosed is that Project Glass will automatically determine if you need and perform Lasik.</p>
<p>When you think about it, they are essentially taking on any phone and tablet strategy by creating a way better product.</p>
<p>I was just <strong>waiting</strong> for him to pull out a certain phone after dissing &#8220;having to pull out and futz with a phone to take a picture&#8230;&#8221;, yup, it was a Galaxy Nexus, with it&#8217;s well known crappy camera (and large size).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a second PR disaster, &#8220;this thing means creepy nerdy guys can always be taking photos and videos of beautiful women, and the target will never know!!!&#8221;, and then &#8220;hey, see this phone that we specifically designed as our flagship, that cost about close to a thousand bucks, that we are only just starting to sell direct, odd carrier for 400* USD?  It actually sucks and is stupid and old fashioned, so don&#8217;t buy it unless you want to be a loser&#8221;.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m hugely impressed with these glasses, this has the potential to be Mac/iPod/iPhone/iPad level huge in changing the world &#8211; if it takes off.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really impressed that Google have shown these publicly too, reminds me of Steve Jobs teasing the iPhone a little before launch, saying he had one in his pocket at D5 onstage with Gates.  Both cases are a real &#8220;you suck Microsoft!&#8221;, showing how far ahead you are.</p>
<p>*i forget the new price straight from Google Play in the USA</p>
<blockquote>Mac/iPod/iPhone/iPad level huge in changing the world – if it takes off.</blockquote>
<p>You lost me there.</p>
<p>Actually, you lost me when you claimed that people will be dissuaded from buying a smartphone because of technology that&#8217;s coming out <em>a year from now.</em></p>
<p>the thing is, you never directly say one of  your companies products &#8220;sucks&#8221;, especially when you&#8217;re kinda one of the absolute top leaders :-)</p>
<p>The GNex is pretty excellent, with the exception of its camera. I don&#8217;t see why having it 7-8 months after release is a big deal. And, at $399, this is still relevant. Carriers other than Verizon didn&#8217;t even have the phone to begin with &#8211; and they use a CDMA network and don&#8217;t use HSPA+. Now, you can take that relatively nice phone and use it on whatever network you want&#8230; something that&#8217;s unheard of for most mainstream Americans.</p>
<p>Would rather have these than the Pebble watch to be honest, assuming that Project Glass will work as an Android peripheral (and why wouldn&#8217;t it?).</p>
<p>Can I fit these with eyeglasses lenses, so I don&#8217;t have to wear two glasses at the same time? One is bad enough.</p>
<p>Looks interesting, though we keep hearing that the versions seen in the wild are early versions of the hmd but they all look remarkably similar as major rev&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One aspect i get on my high-horse about is the way the Project Glass team are trying to make it sound like this is a wholly unique (Google-X) concept. In reality they had to acquire the Private Eye VR hmd concept from the 90&#8217;s that originated the idea. Project Glass has to work on its tracking and content functionality &#8211; the hmd technology is already proven: <a href="http://igargoyle.com/archives/1028cmu-a.jpg" target="_blank">http://igargoyle.com/archives/1028cmu-a.jpg</a></p>
<p>It &#8220;frees his hands&#8221; except when he needs to do something. And don&#8217;t touch the side, Gavin!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think I can wait until next year :(</p>
<p>&#8220;Will these help me pick up chicks who are into technology?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You know, I&#8217;m sick of the usual TV hosts, actresses, my campaign managers wife&#8217;s, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The glasses oddly remind me of Homer&#8217;s homemade football.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21634253@N03/2350158028/" title="Homer's home made football by Roadmast3r, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2113/2350158028_c6611354ed.jpg" height="333" alt="Homer's home made football" width="500" /></a></p>
<p>Why we see nothing but hand free photos? Not very tempting.</p>
<p>The sides i don´t get are:<br />
-If i use usual glasses, couldn´t then the actual glasses feature that screen instead of it being that small extra part in the upright corner? <br />
-Also fitting to that: Why is it only on the side of one eye instead of both?</p>
<p>Besides that, i think if they get it working well a device like this could get a pretty far reaching adoption rate quickly.</p>
<p>As someone wearing glasses and usually disliking it i´d suddenly feel way better about wearing them =)<br />
I´d be much more interested in getting navigation info in my view rather than taking photos with it though.</p>
<p>Dunno, the taking photos part without the other one noticing is something i think is kinda weird that they are highlighting it.<br />
I imagine its probably because more involved software isn´t ready for it yet, but yeah, it is a bit creepy so its not the one side i would highlight about it =)</p>
<blockquote>If i use usual glasses, couldn´t then the actual glasses feature that screen instead of it being that small extra part in the upright corner? Also fitting to that: Why is it only on the side of one eye instead of both?</blockquote>
<p>Do you want to die? Imagine driving a car of walking down the street with icons flying just before your eyes. The reasons are: ergonomics, simplicity and safety.</p>
<blockquote>Dunno, the taking photos part without the other one noticing is something i think is kinda weird that they are highlighting it.</blockquote>
<p>No it&#8217;s not. Taking photos alone is not so interesting but advertising it as &#8216;you won&#8217;t even notice when&#8217; fixes all issues average people have with all kinds of cameras &#8211; if something amazing happens, you don&#8217;t have time to pull it out, prepare, point and shoot. With glasses you just do the gesture and it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Video on the hand. Have you seen GoPro footage of some sort or other <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKmR7kBZvTQ">cool pov videos</a>? Project Glass can record what your eyes see (more or less) any time you want (as long as you are wearing them).</p>
<blockquote>Video on the hand. Have you seen GoPro footage of some sort or other cool pov videos? Project Glass can record what your eyes see (more or less) any time you want (as long as you are wearing them).</blockquote>
<p>Now, rather than a video, a live stream. You&#8217;re playing an FPS, using your own neighborhood. Zombies are spawning everywhere. You have an AR AK, with just under a full mag, an AR knife and an AR Desert Eagle with 2 mags. You have to get to the supermarket to load up on &#8220;supplies&#8221; (checklist given by the missus). People are watching you play. They are cheering for you to make it, or cheering because a zombie just ate your brain. In real time.</p>
<p>Game of the future right there.</p>
<p>how dangerous or useful a display on usual glasses would be would depend on the implementation =) I didn´t mean something covering up your whole view constantly of course =9<br />
For navigation i more meant something like in a gta or saints row game where it shows semi transparent arrows in proper perspective projection on the street on the sides so one knows which way to turn.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t they make the glasses look like those stylish ones with the thick black sides?  You could hold some electronics on either side and then snake the wires through the top of the frame and into the dis<img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ZVl3g4WfT_M/TTb8BseCZCI/AAAAAAAAKfk/eeeCgljFhK0/s1600/first%2Blady%2Bframes%2Bfrom%2BGlassesUSA.jpg" />play/camera</p>
<p>Because prototype?</p>
<p>Because the glass used to display the image clearly needs to be quite thick. <br />
Maybe we&#8217;ll see something like that in future versions.</p>
<p>Eh? There&#8217;s no glass in the current version</p>
<p>The thick glass viewfinder.</p>
<p>Not getting the Google Glass until it comes in a monocle.</p>
<p>I think, by then, the name would be Google Class.</p>
<p>A major factor that I am interested in is battery life on these glasses. They need to last at least all day in order to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but I just can&#8217;t get excited about this stuff. Am I doing it wrong as a nerd?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>What a horrible admission.  You should consider deleting your account.</p>
<p>I know. But, the idea of having to &#8220;wear&#8221; something sounds obnoxious to me. The idea of a phone in my pocket that is unobtrusive is better to me. I don&#8217;t know how it really works, I assume, it will be showing you things constantly because it&#8217;s right in front of your eyes. The technology sounds incredible and amazing and I get really happy thinking about it. But, the practically sounds&#8230; well not practical and, kind of, dumb.</p>
<p>I agree, pants are terrible.</p>
<p>So, Google Glasses will keep you warm and dry? K.</p>
<p>After an entire day of ponderance, encompassing 1.5-3 hours of hard thought, I have come to the conclusion that these Google Glasses will never come to market.</p>
<p>At the end of 2012, Google will release a press release stating that all work on this project has been suspended indefinitely.  Microsoft Courier redux.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think tech that is prototyped, in the wild, being used by people, and shown off left and right is really going to follow the same path as a product that was never announced, never shown off, never prototyped, never had a concept video that was meant for outside consumption, and that was going to be a very niche product even upon release, due to its focus on content creation.</p>
<p>Maybe it is just me, but I am seeing a lot of regurgitated news on The Verge. Lots of short rehashes of someone else&#8217;s article with links to the source (not the verge). I guess I could be mistaken as to what The Verge is trying to be. News Source or aggregator?</p>
<p>The project was announced and immediately people had visions of a future with neveredning ads popping on your vision.</p>
<p>There is another possibility, though. This could lead to a world where the actual phisical world will be <em>clear</em> of ads, and they would only pop up in our AR displays. And they could be not only targeted but filtered.</p>
<p>Advertisement is already something that already exists in the physical world outside of Glasses of whatever. It is annoying, it is in our faces all the time. Glasses could be a tool to help us making advertisement less annoying.</p>
<p>Some cities have been creating new laws to put limits to advertisement in the streets. I love them. But maybe we can&#8217;t really live totally without them. Glasses and other devices can help up have more discrete advertisements and cleaner streets, by allowing us to put the desired (and also undesired) content all there.</p>
<p>The same goes for museum exhibitions Those tags by the side of the works are a pain. I hate them. I would prefer if we had no tags at all, no signs, or a bare minimum, and then we could check for more information with something like glasses, or even smartphones, today, right now.</p>
<p>Does it run Brain Burst? I&#8217;ll wait for a Neuro Linker. :P</p>
<p>Otacon?!</p>
<p>fffffuuuuu the video aint available</p>
<p>This is the mark of a whole new era of POV Pron !<br />
<img src="http://i.cubeupload.com/USGf5k.gif" /></p>
<p>Blackmirror E03 is upon us. Paranoia is the next step forward. Beware :)</p>
<p>The glasses are great and all , and I&#8217;m sure will be a tech tour de force, but the number of head injuries from muggers targeting folks for their $500+ glasses are gonna skyrocket! : )</p>
<p>Relax. If you are wearing the glasses, they are much more likely to punch you in the belly.</p>
<p>I just pooped a rainbow</p>
<p>This is going to improve my spank bank so much! :D</p>
<p>Interesting that he is looking to essentially / eventually replace the phone. That wouldn&#8217;t make feel to confident if I were an Android OS devotee.</p>
<p>Project Glass is nothing unless it has good battery life, snappy performance and useful HUD features. Really unless it replaces all of the functions of a smartphone, why would the everyman wear it? A camera that you can wear is cool, but not innovative.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&#8217;t see how they get all-day batter life out of something so small, especially if it&#8217;s connecting to LTE networks.</p>
<p>Am I the only one that was very disappointed at the method of navigation?I hadn&#8217;t looked, but I kind of hoped that this had some kind of eye-tracking feature selection. To find out that this thing is just a tiny screen with a trackpad attached is pretty underwhelming.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also head-orientation tracking and voice control.</p>
<p>Great use of Hangouts on Air. Great minds behind Project Glass.</p>
<p><em>This is the best time to be a tech enthusiast.</em></p>
<p>I really think that Hangouts on Air is going to be a huge new thing for media. I run a monthly web show, and while our production quality is high, it is only possible after a HUGE amount of technical effort in getting it to work. Google is taking a lot of the complication out of that process, and while the end result of a Hangout isn&#8217;t quite as high of production value, it is definitely much more accessible to the average person/company.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Those shots really highlight how much of the picture is missed when you use your hands to take a picture. Hangouts on Air really feels underestimated at the moment, it&#8217;s such a great feature. I guess if more conferences and events start using it, that will be the leverage Google can use to get more active users onto G+.</p>
<p>Cell phone, feature phone, smartphone&#8230; And now the <em>gonzophone</em>!</p>
<p>I love those point-of-view shots. It&#8217;s the future folks.</p>
<p>Football overthrown, breaks one of 3 working Project Glass prototypes.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Imagine getting into a motor vehicle accident. With Google Glasses, it would seen posible to take pictures in the seconds before the event which would be valuable in the courtroom later on.<br />
This will make taking video while skydiving easier.<br />
I can think of several uses for this but these are what come to mind.</p>
<p>SCUBA STUFF!!!!</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;and, you know, outer space.</p>
<p>And on the subject of motor vehicles, or any vehicle, why limit it to the drivers and passengers? Those things have glass all over them&#8230;?</p>
<p>When the quality gets close to broadcast quality you could give it to athletes  and get a unique view during their event. Imagine watching Usain Bolt win a 100m sprint in 1st person view.</p>
<p>They are beginning to try this in Formula 1 with cameras inside the drivers helmets; you begin to see how little they can actually see when driving at ~200 mph.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t for augmented reality porn.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t for either.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for augmented reality porn.</p>
<p>U don&#8217;t hv to say it twice&#8230;..we got it!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be pretty disappointed if the main selling point of this thing is that it&#8217;s a camera you can strap to your head, but that seems to be the only news about it lately&#8230;</p>
<p>its not the main selling point, its pretty much a smartphone on your head with extra things here and there, its not so much what has bein shown but what developers can make with it <strong>that</strong> is what makes this thing <strong>huge</strong>. just thinking about you picking up something and you dont know what it is and the glasses tell you everything about it from what its made it up its wiki page is brought up tells you how to cook it or what flower it is weather a bug is eatable, the information that can be optianed is ridiculous, imagine you meet someone take a pic of them and later in a couple days you forgot what he/she looked like and your glasses bring up hey u met this person here and this time doing this dumb ass. i dont expect all those things to be in the first iteration but wouldn&#8217;t doubt it if devs made a crewed version of what i just said even on the first one.</p>
<p>Sure, I get the theoretical potential, but the point is that so far there have been a ton of articles about this thing which are all focused on taking pictures. We get it. It has a camera. Not real exciting so far.</p>
<p>The reason they were talking about pictures is because it was showcased at Google&#8217;s photographer conference.  They&#8217;ve shown the other things it can do in a promo video.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this: If Google is going to pull this off it&#8217;s going to take Brin, not Braun.</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/004/029/disgusted-mother-of-god.png" /></p>
<p>Nice one there.</p>
<p>Wow&#8230;I really wish I would&#8217;ve had Glass during high school&#8230;</p>
<p>You weren&#8217;t bullied enough?</p>
<p>Okay, if anyone else read Transmetropolitan, they&#8217;ll understand why I want these with one red circle lens and one green rectangular lens.</p>
<p>I wonder if at IO they&#8217;ll let attendees try them out.</p>
<p>Pretty useful for people in law enforcement, etc. Instead of there being a camera on the dashboard of their car, it&#8217;s on them.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for Law Enforcement to get bent out of shape over the public using Project Glass.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s with the 2 minutes of dead air at the beginning of the video?</p>
<p>bad demo but someone else will take this and run with it. i love tech but this demo is so uninspiring that i wouldn&#8217;t wear or use these glasses if they were given to me for free. no one cares about taking hands-free pictures. these guys are smart but lack personality, passion and presence. if you want people to get excited, you&#8217;ll have to come back with more next time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4" target="new"></a> Check that link out.  That was the first video on the potential uses of the glasses.  This one was focused on photography because it was showcased during their photography conference.</p>
<p>And somehow my links never appear: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c6W4CCU9M4</a></p>
<p>Why do  they have 2 iPads&#8217; on the table?</p>
<p>This would be far more awesome if Glass was more than just a headcam.</p>
<p>It definitely will be more than just a headcam! Google was just granted patent for Smart Glove.</p>
<p>I wish they would reveal a bit more how user input works &#8212;is the phone the input, is there a Smart Glove using to gestures to control the device, or what ? The entire concept looks like it could be bogged down by poor user interface that sorta negates its purpose (like not just sticking with a smartphone).</p>
<p>The premise is interesting but it looks like in practice it could be more a hassle than tool; although I guess advancements gotta be made somewhere.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that there&#8217;s a trackpad on one side of the frame but no word on whether the final version will have one as well. Instead of keyboard entry, i think this will have voice recognition.</p>
<p>Wow, this thing will never take off. It looks stupid even on models. It takes something pretty awful to make them look this terrible.</p>
<p>Do you understan the concept of a prototype? Is there another, similar wearable-computer concept that looks any better than this? or that even exists? I don&#8217;t know of any, certainly not one as close to market-ready as this one.</p>
<p>Which is why no one will wear a computer in daily life. I&#8217;d expect these to be limited in use to specific applications.</p>
<p>Or perhaps in the future everyone will look like a douche.</p>
<p>Clearly you&#8217;ve never heard of bluetooth headsets.</p>
<p>Actually I&#8217;d cite that as proof. No one but a douche wears those around. And they are certainly not mass market.</p>
<p>I used to see tons of people wearing those stupid bluetooth ear pieces before the iPhone came out and they incorporated the mic in the headset.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re experimenting with stuff like this, it seems:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/06/vicglass.jpg" /></p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/27/google-glass-details-voice-command-connectivity-options/">Source</a>)</p>
<p>What about a small wearable touchpad on the back of your hand?<br />
A watch face, or a ring.</p>
<p>I think they applied the KISS principle. A separate device (watch or ring) would mean individual charging and increased battery drain.</p>
<p>Combined with an omnitool Project Glass is a winner:</p>
<p><img src="http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2010/181/f/9/Shepard__s_Omni_Tool_by_BlackSheep64.png" /></p>
<p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y93/furious_dc/vicglass1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sorry couldn&#8217;t resist :D</p>
<p>It seems that they intend to use the phone at least for network connections.<br />
Some possible input methods :<br />
-voice activation &#8220;start recording a movie&#8221;; &#8220;call johanna&#8221;<br />
-eye tracking to detect what you are looking at,  allowing to give a context to your vocal commands<br />
-input on the touchpad on the side of the glass, for example to flick through a photo collection<br />
-your smartphone to type your commands<br />
-this smart glove&#8230; it was ridiculous with 90&#8217;s technology, but maybe it is time to make it work.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a much better way no one is saying. Leave the camera on and record at say 2fps. When a user gestures something in the air, respond by recording in higher speed/detail and doing what the user asked for.</p>
<p>The name &#8220;smart glove&#8221; brings to mind this: <br />
<img src="http://blog.effectiveui.com/wp-content/uploads/power_glove_3.jpg" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s so bad.</p>
<p>I wonder if Google&#8217;s &#8220;smart glove&#8221; is a power glove for Android devices or a power glove running Android.</p>
<p>If the glove is running android, it will be bad news. when it crashes, the glove makes you grab the nearest butt so it can reboot.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get whatever joke you&#8217;re trying to get at here&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even want to know what joke they are trying to get at.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the joke but I remember wanting one of those so bad when I was a kid but we were too poor.</p>
<p>The first time I saw this poster I had to check whether it was a fake or not.<br />
The idea is not stupid but 90&#8217;s technology was not up to the task.</p>
<p>Cool.  Didn&#8217;t know about the glove.<br />
But this thing is still out there very very early.</p>
<p>Interesting.  As if they are trying to create social acceptability for it long before it&#8217;s a commercial product.</p>
<p>They way they&#8217;re promoting it, like at NY Fashion Week, tells me they&#8217;re just trying to draw maximum publicity to their prototypes so that Apple can&#8217;t sue them when Apple comes out with a slicker version 2-3 years later.</p>
<p>OMG.</p>
<p>&#8230;wow</p>
<p>Apple would never produce something so ill-conceived and tasteless.</p>
<p>so something worst.</p>
<p>Try again.</p>
<p>You mean like a 9 inch tablet that takes pictures?</p>
<p>What exactly is ill-conceived and tasteless about a wearable AR computer?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ill-conceived because it will create more harm than good. Most people aren&#8217;t capable of texting and walking. This won&#8217;t make life better for anyone and it will cause many, many problems. That&#8217;s not a knock on Google&#8217;s implementation, just on AR for civilians (see regular people), generally.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tasteless because it looks incredibly silly on a person&#8217;s face. It&#8217;s not symmetrical, it blocks half of your eye, and frankly it looks uncomfortable. And, if you ran into someone on the street and decided to have a real conversation, you&#8217;d have to take it off, lest you look like an asshole.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interest concept, sure, but this will never be go-to-market. It will take a company with some sense of aesthetics and common sense to bring any sort of functional AR to the real world &#8211; and even then I&#8217;m skeptical.</p>
<p>This is not the future.</p>
<p>This is likely, as you called it, just a concept. At best this is a first generation model in which the form:function ratio is still heavily weighted on the side of function.</p>
<p>It will take a few generations before the technology matures to the point that design can become more of a factor.</p>
<p>Nevermind the fact that the aesthetics are a purely subjective matter and there may well be many people out there who are not offended by this device&#8217;s looks like you seem to be.</p>
<p>This has been the dream of many for years.  it is the future no matter how silly it may appear right now.</p>
<p>in 10 years it will be more than just a headcam, until then its nothing more than just a spycam you can buy from skymall</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it already is more than that now. They most likely just not showing the interface. We know there&#8217;s an interface because they&#8217;ve been shown using the side touchpad to access photos and whatnot, so there&#8217;s gotta be some type of interface there.</p>
<p>Wow, that image is impressively high-quality, as well as perfectly capturing the moment. So cool :D</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, now they totally look cool and not dorky&#8221; -no one</p>
<p>My name isn&#8217;t &#8220;no one&#8221;, it&#8217;s GSArora, get it right!</p>
<p>But did the fashion show change your opinion, or did you think they look cool before ;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, it was the beautiful models (though reluctantly) rocking these glasses that made them cool</p>
<p>Kind&#8217;ve like JT and Kanye with hipster glasses (I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten mine otherwise!)</p>
<p>Wayfarers?  Haven&#8217;t those been cool since 1960?</p>
<p>Fair enough</p>
<p>The models look aghast at having to wear something so anti-fashion in a fashion show</p>
<p>Than you probably don&#8217;t follow high fashion most of it is unpratical.</p>
<p>But pretty cool stuff. Would love to see fashion week runways from the model persepectives.</p>
<p>Correct, most runway items don&#8217;t belong in day-to-day wardrobes and can be fantastically impractical, but rather they present a carefully manicured look to represent the vision of the designer and the fashion trend of the moment.</p>
<p>Tacking on some dorky, tacky looking item like project glass goes against that.  Fashion shows are about presenting the dresses and the fashion, not getting a live stream of the back of the model in front of you or the expressions on the faces of the people watching.  If they really wanted that sort of vision they could easily use pinhole cameras concealed properly in/on an actual fashion piece so that it doesn&#8217;t disrupt the look.</p>
<p>Good points. Was looking at from more of the experimental documentaion, rather than the google glass not not flowing with the theme of the show.</p>
<p>But they made a Pink one&#8230;.  pink is fashion, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>yep, still looks dorky</p>
<p>Hate it or love it, gonna be the next big thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue that they don&#8217;t look any worse than the sunglasses the other two chicks are wearing in the pic.</p>
<p>Surely &#8220;peek&#8221; not &#8220;peak&#8221;?</p>
<p>Fixed.</p>
<p>What AR? What Glasses? All I can tell is that this is a camera on your eyebrow. I&#8217;ve seen no actual proof that it is or has been made anything near that video they dumped off several months ago. We&#8217;ve had tiny cameras forever, Google&#8230; let&#8217;s start putting this together into something actual! Jesus.</p>
<p>The models are saying kill me on the inside for having to wear something that ugly</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had one casual eye on what&#8217;s going on in fashion this year and let me tell you: those models are being put in far uglier things than Google Glass.</p>
<p>The money&#8217;s good though.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a fashion magazine? they&#8217;ll wear anything as long as they get paid.</p>
<p>OK, first I like the technology of it.  Second, wearing the spy-cam glasses can get someone hurt.  Not the person in the video, but the person wearing the recording device.  Wearing one of these can make other people around you very uncomfortable and that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll get punch in the face if you don&#8217;t take the Google &#8216;SPY&#8217; Glasses OFF.  This had happened to one man who did just that.  We will all know if one is wearing just by the stupid designs.  I don&#8217;t care how fashionable these glasses are, <strong>YOU&#8217;RE GONNA GET HURT</strong>!!!! Not by your dorky looks, but by showing people you have these spy glasses on.</p>
<p>Now that I got that off my face, has anyone seen any more Microsoft Surface ads in NYC?</p>
<p>If you try to step to me in my Google Glass, I will <strong>FUCK YOU UP!!!!</strong></p>
<p>And then upload it to YouTube.</p>
<p>Oh god.  You&#8217;re right.  Video Instagram.</p>
<p>Oh god, did someone punched you in your face?  Sorry about your face and your spy glasses.  Shit happens! :-)</p>
<p>I will remember to keep clear of Microsoft fanboys then.<br />
They get frightened by new things.</p>
<p>OH NO YOU DIDN&#8217;T  make fun of Microsoft fanboys!! This means war! You might want to take off your Google Spy Glass.  It&#8217;s gonna get Ugly!</p>
<p>That model has some bad posture&#8230;thought they were like beat into having perfect posture?</p>
<p>She&#8217;s too weak and hungered out to stand straight up. Probably the google glass is dragging her head down.</p>
<p>Google Wave.</p>
<p>Backstage fashion show videos. Google is getting desperate to rub off the geek stink.</p>
<p>Will porn be next, not so far now.</p>
<p>Now i&#8217;m picturing porn with google glass!</p>
<p>Going into porn next will only increase Google&#8217;s geek-stench!</p>
<blockquote>Will porn be next, not so far now.</blockquote>
<p>A lot of new technology gets its early adopters thanks to porn (VHS, digital recording, streaming video, etc.), and Google Glasses might be no different. Imagine how much better gonzo porn would be if the guy didn&#8217;t have to hold a camera anymore!</p>
<p>And with that our Sci-Fi dreams have turned into hipster backwash&#8230;</p>
<p>Google&#8230;..we get the camera part of &#8220;Project Glass&#8221; &#8230;..can we now see the interface and OSD?</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s all the cocaine?</p>
<p>Rick James went through all of it already.</p>
<p>hmmm, its kind of like a smartphone but with no 3rd party apps&#8230;yet.</p>
<p>i think this could be awesome.</p>
<p>I like the idea of glass, but it needs to be hella useful if it&#8217;s gonna take off.  They at least need to add an earpiece to it so it can replace bluetooth headsets as well.  A visual-only experience won&#8217;t be enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be honest.</p>
<p>All I saw was a Terezi cosplay.</p>
<p>My friend and I will have a stockpile of cash waiting for you, Google. Take as much time as you need, and remember, Awesome Final Product = More cash for you!</p>
<p>I really hope Google can pull this off. But given its track record (Google TV, Chrome OS) I wouldn&#8217;t expect too much.</p>
<p>And I love how this has only 20 comments LOL. Where are the trolls who filled up that other article with &#8220;this sux!! its only a concept and vaporware!! it will never ship!!&#8221; now? ;)</p>
<p>Google TV &amp; Chrome OS are just getting started &#8230; &#8220;give them time&#8221;.</p>
<p>Track record like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps, Android.</p>
<p>Google Docs (well the word processor), Google Maps and Android were all developed outside of Google &amp; acquired. They have of course made significant improvements to all those products, but their track record with home-grown technologies are a decidedly mixed bag.</p>
<p>How do you know this is home-grown? Additionally, Google Maps is pretty different than its acquired incarnation, and Android doesn&#8217;t resemble the original product from the standpoint of the end-user. They might not be home-grown technologies, but pretty much all the success for the product has come from the work and changes they&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>Hmm, normally when companies are acquired there is something that causes a leak to the press&#8230; perhaps even regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Supposedly it&#8217;s not entirely home-grown.  It has been linked to MITs MITHril Project from 1999:  <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/photos.html" target="new"></a><img src="http://www.media.mit.edu/wearables/mithril/limor-small.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sexy</p>
<p>Gmail and Google Search are pretty excellent products in my opinion.</p>
<p>As a slight offtopic. Did you know that Microsoft SQL Server was acquired in 1996 or so? Is it a bad product after Microsoft put 16 years in it? Same with Exchange &#8211; first it was acquired, then improved. Companies most of the time tend to improve successful products they acquired a while ago.</p>
<p>Microsoft steal from Google Project Glass !!!</p>
<p>How it looks now?</p>

<p><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/25ewosj.png" /></p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t forget that their fortune all started with a home grown product, Google it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to lose with this game. Check out the list of discontinued Google products: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products#Discontinued_products_and_services" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_products#Discontinued_products_and_services</a></p>
<p>Not debating that Google has had its share of flops (partly because they are very open with their development process, and embrace public exposure of more &#8220;out-there&#8221; concepts).<br />
That said, a lot of the items in that list were not failures, per se.  Ex. Google Gears became redundant with the advent of HTML5, Google Checkout became merged with Google Wallet, Page Creator was integrated into Google Sites, GOOG-411 helped development of Google Voice&#8230;.  And these are just some examples.</p>
<p>TL;DR &#8211; Just because things were discontinued doesn&#8217;t mean that they were a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Well said!</p>
<p>^This. I want this device to happen, but I have little faith in Google&#8217;s ability to push a product through and then support it long term unless it&#8217;s making massive amounts of money for them.</p>
<p>That and the concern about ads in my eyes, like I don&#8217;t have enough of them around.</p>
<p>Sorry but this isn&#8217;t exactly an awesome track record.  Until recently, GMail looked pretty lame.  Android only became successful because Apple was in bed with ATT.  MS would have been in the same position had they been to market at the same time.  People were dying for an iPhone alternative and Google was in the right place.  I&#8217;m sorry, but Android is boring and stale.  In fact, most Google products are like garage projects.  Look at Google+.  Tons of users, but little use.  Everyone likes news stuff so they signed up and then went back to Twitter or Facebook.  Let&#8217;s not talk about Google TV because we&#8217;ll probably hurt someone&#8217;s feelings.  And Project Glass is a ripped off idea from IBM.  It&#8217;ll be years until this comes to market and i seriously doubt we&#8217;re going to see people walking about wearing these things.  Great concept, but not practical.  Google needs to stay focused on a Mobile OS that can take updates, unlike what it does now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until recently, GMail looked pretty lame.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. </p>
<p>TL:DR &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m a boring troll.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those are all opinions, not a basis for an argument.</p>
<p>Its better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all</p>
<p>I should give credit for the photo above to Thomas Hawk. He&#8217;ll have higher resolution versions uploaded tonight. I shot this image of the back of his Canon 5D MK III.</p>

<p>Viagra ads while on the walk.</p>
<p>Boy, I can&#8217;t wait for this!</p>
<p>give&#8217;s new meaning to &#8220;incognito&#8221;!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still waiting for those ads on Android phones that everyone told me about.. They were meant to pop up whenever you drive past Walmart?! I thought Android will flood me with ads from everywhere while I&#8217;m walking down a road?</p>
<p>I think that for as much money as Google makes off of ads, and for exactly how &#8220;in your face&#8221; they could be with them if they wanted, they&#8217;ve done a remarkable job of striking a healthy balance of ad presentation. They completely revolutionized ads in search. Ads in Gmail are very unobtrusive. Android doesn&#8217;t even have ads, except in-app, and that&#8217;s at the discretion of the developer. About the only annoying place that I see ads on a Google product is YouTube, but you can tell they&#8217;re trying to find a good solution there as well.</p>
<p>Now, the pervasive tracking and storage of user data&#8230;that&#8217;s another story. I honestly don&#8217;t mind at all that Google follows what I&#8217;m doing to the point that it helps deliver targeted ads; what I DO want is a way for that data to show up in my Google profile so that I can, at my discretion, go in and remove certain tracking points. Yes, you can sort of do this by browsing incognito and such, but really, Google should just do the right thing and let people manage their data. I think the vast majority of people wouldn&#8217;t care (and wouldn&#8217;t bother); the rest would simply delete information they don&#8217;t want tracked (and likely wouldn&#8217;t want ADS for either). I&#8217;m sure a small percentage would go through and wholesale remove all the content, but that&#8217;s the price you pay for doing the right thing. I think the pluses (fantastic PR) would vastly overshadow the negatives (a small percentage of users no longer having their data tracked).</p>

<p>Looking at Brin, I was reminded of this:</p>
<p><img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyydss7HT31qfvrz1o1_500.jpg" /></p>
<p>he kinda looks like Leonard :) and both are geeky personalities</p>
<p>Will they license the relevant <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/6/2686410/vuzix-nokia-smart-glasses-transparent-display-hud" target="new">Nokia IP</a> before they productise it? It looks like Vuzix will be releasing their version<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQyJAYRzsPo" target="new"> in Q3</a></p>
<p>Oh yeah, because I&#8217;m sure Google &#8220;stole&#8221; Nokia&#8217;s technology when they built this. Is that where you&#8217;re going with this?</p>
<p>Can you please describe the patents in question?</p>
<p>Oh, you were just trolling? Ok, I&#8217;ll be on my way again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;very useful&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s how I think of a fork. I&#8217;m not trying to bring a downer on this project, from what I&#8217;ve seen I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for me but I&#8217;m sure for a lot of people this looks really cool. All of the things they showed in the concept video didn&#8217;t seem useful to me. I can do this on my phone on the <strong>rare</strong> occasions I need too.</p>
<p>But it is early days. When Apple opened up iPhone development nobody knew what really cool things they would enable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While a fully-functioning product was presented in Google&#8217;s announcement video, the prototype glasses aren&#8217;t quite there yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really, The Verge!?!?! That is a <a href="https://plus.google.com/111626127367496192147/posts">concept video</a>. The clue is the caption on the video: <strong>Project Glass: One day&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>I think this is more of a case of &#8220;iPad introduction&#8221;. For the first half year no one really knew what to do with the damn thing. It was much easier with iPhone.</p>
<p>The iPhone was announced 6 months ahead, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;what amounts to a smartphone to your head.&#8221; I would think the glasses would just be a display that receives info via Bluetooth from a smartphone.  The way Brian Bishop imagined it is pretty dumb. I&#8217;m surprised someone who writes for a tech blog would think of it that way,</p>
<p>&#8230;It&#8217;s displaying the smartphone to your eyes. Like putting a smartphone to your head. What the hell is wrong with the way he said it?</p>
<p>so this isnt an april fools joke? im confused lol i was fairly certain that ad that google did was just a joke :)</p>
<p>usually, google has humor in their april fools jokes&#8230;where&#8217;s the humor in this?</p>
<p>The concept.</p>
<p>please explain how this seems remotely humorous.</p>
<p>I love this product, I want to have it so bad. This is the first product in a while that I&#8217;m truly excited about. I really love the geeky look to the glasses and hope it will also connect to other services like Facebook, I don&#8217;t want to depend on Google+.</p>
<p>No Facebook. That much should be obvious.</p>
<p>Yeah right!,  because we all know Facebook is blocked on Android devices.  Good deduction Sherlock.</p>
<p>give Google+ a try, it&#8217;s not that bad. But I&#8217;m pretty sure this won&#8217;t have facebook.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s entirely possible that they&#8217;ll add Facebook integration at some point; interoperability, customisation and integration are kind of Android&#8217;s thing, and it&#8217;s likely Google will apply the same philosophy to glass.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely the trolls, saying it&#8217;ll have ads, are right. When was the last time an ad from google showed up on your Android homescreen</p>
<p>Shush, you&#8217;re making sense. The trolls can smell that&#8230;</p>
<p>True, but Google is more than likely losing money overall with Android.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re still making slim profits, but that&#8217;s not Google&#8217;s strategy. Google never intended to make a lot of money from Android.</p>
<p>Instead, Google wants more and more people to use Android so that they stick to the Google ecosystem. Android has integration with GMail, YouTube, Search, etc which bring in money. Google is still centered around Search, and more people using Android = more people sticking to search = more advertising $.</p>
<p>Technically, their model is to displace software vendors (Apple, Microsoft, etc.) with a free product to capture more customers for their advertising.</p>
<p>Google is definitely the software company v2, but I think Apple and MS can put up a fight. Better for us all, anywho.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s objective with Android was to create an open platform that any vendor could use as they (correctly) saw Mobile as the next big jump in Internet usage and they didn&#8217;t want to be locked out of the market.  If you look at the Oracle lawsuit filings, their primary fear was Microsoft, not Apple, getting a dominant position in mobile with their licensed OS model and having a lock in with the non-Apple OEMs, which would subsequently lead to them being locked out of the mobile market.  That&#8217;s why they made it open source and gave it away for free.</p>
<p>Had they not developed Android, Windows Phone would be the dominant OS and Google&#8217;s services would have been shut out.</p>
<p>This is why they could care less about Amazon forking Android because those users will still use Google search and services, even if they aren&#8217;t built in.</p>
<p>In hindsight, that strategy seems completely justified.  They weren&#8217;t worried so much about Apple as they were all the OEMs that weren&#8217;t Apple, because they would ultimately have gone with Microsoft who would then steer everyone to Microsoft services to the detriment of Google.</p>
<p>I really wish Apple fan boys would realize this.  Apple was never the target when Android was developed.</p>
<p>And yet Google made very specific shots at Apple and clearly went after Apple in some cases.  Google decided to go after everyone in the name of ad revenue because they realized they needed more diverse revenue streams.</p>
<p>Which is why they will sell this as a product, with Apple-like profits &#8211; and that&#8217;s how they should do it. They won&#8217;t have any need for ads like this.</p>
<p>You do realize the whole issue with the ads has been made up by trolls, right?</p>
<p>Please care to elaborate on how Google looses money on Android? Do you realize that Google makes profit out of the search and advertising  platforms, same way the make money on IOS.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amusing how the same people who say they won&#8217;t use Siri because they don&#8217;t want to be seen talking to their phone, are the same people saying this is an awesome project that they can&#8217;t wait for.</p>
<p>HUD glasses are not a new idea, the concept (which is all this is) and prototypes have been made in various forms over the years. It&#8217;s nothing more than one of those &#8220;cool&#8221; ideas that people realise is really a crappy idea once they get their hands on it.</p>
<p>However having said that I can see their research put to use elsewhere, I don&#8217;t know where but certainly not HUD glasses.</p>
<p>Agree, a lot. Personally I think this looks really cool. Much like Siri, or Kinect hacks I would use it non stop for the first few days and then find that I&#8217;d use it much less at specific times where it made more sense.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a game changer, but looks cool and thank goodness that Google is doing this stuff, despite it not being having an obvious market&#8230;yet.</p>
<p>I think the difference is that when Siri came out, it was neat, but not mind blowing. We&#8217;d seen it before. This, however, is something that nobody has really seen before outside of obscure concepts and movies.</p>
<p>Where had we seen it before? Siri is not the same as what Android and iOS (and even OS X) have had previously with various far simpler forms of voice control.</p>
<p>Um yes, it pretty much is. It&#8217;s just a tad more advanced. Where have you ever seen anything like these glasses in real life? That&#8217;s the difference.</p>
<p>Not buying until they have decent and discrete frames. Awesome project but I want to use it in public without feeling like an idiot.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about looking like an idiot, but I&#8217;d like them to be discrete so I can use them without worrying about getting robbed.</p>
<p>Try &#8216;discreet.&#8217;</p>
<p>That&#8217;ll probably around generation two or three; just be prepared to wear glasses with fairly thick frames. If you&#8217;re a hipster, you&#8217;re golden. If not&#8230; Well, we all make sacrifices in life.</p>
<p>but what does Philip Seymour-Hoffman in the picture think of them?</p>
<p>Picture&#8217;s been changed now, so no Hoffman :(</p>
<p>I doubt they will actually ship this until late 2013 or 2014. We&#8217;ve already seen lots of &#8220;concept&#8221; videos of Intel or Microsoft. They just want to make people talk about them. And probably they will fail. Nobody except us  geeks wants to talk with their glasses in public.</p>
<p>This is a social experiment.  The tech isn&#8217;t there yet for an affordable solution but Google knows it will be within a couple of years. What they also know is that new paradigms require adjustment time.  This device will change behaviours, just as cell phones changed how people interact with and use technology. Of course it looks geeky and there is definitely a discomfort level with the concept. Image a Google Glasses equipped person conversing face to face with someone not wearing the glasses. The second person wonders whether their partner in conversation is paying attention as information is accessed through speaking apparently to themselves. It brings a third &#8220;person&#8221; into the chat. There will need to be a social etiquette developed over time to allow people to understand how to behave. There is nothing more personal in social interactions than eye-to-eye contact.  The GGs intercede into this delicate, honed over eons, social more.  This is not dissimilar to Googles approach to the driver-less car. Simply releasing a product into society would cause a backlash. The public need to be educated and helped to see this isn&#8217;t a threat but a tool.</p>
<p>In other words, Google knows that timing is everything and that increasing awareness and inclusion of the concept is required well before release into the wild. Right now it’s a talking point. It&#8217;s a start and it’s the right way to tackle this technology.</p>
<p>By the way, the third app developed for GGs will be &#8220;X-ray&#8221; vision. It will not be free or ad-supported. Every guy will buy it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a really interesting perspective and one I hadn&#8217;t considered.  Given the size of the response (7MM youtube views,, lot of coverage, etc.) and the general positive nature of it, I&#8217;d say it was a pretty successful first step.</p>
<p>One question, the icons and dialogues are so close to the eyes that the screen need to have about 10 times the DPI of iPhone 4S, in order not to notice the pixels of the icons&#8230; Is such a screen even possible currently?</p>
<p>The images are projected and reflected.</p>
<p>Some guy on youtube found a few mistakes in that video Google made about Project Glass. Luckily he was able to fix it and re-uploaded it:<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/_mRF0rBXIeg" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/_mRF0rBXIeg</a></p>
<p>So this is basically a heads up display feeding us info of the world around us all Terminator like:</p>
<p><img src="http://regmedia.co.uk/2012/02/07/terminator_hud_shot.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m game.</p>
<p>the display is certainly the toughest part, but having a camera, mic, speakers and wireless to a phone are all very close to reality now. I&#8217;d like to see it be WiFi direct or bluetooth 4.0 +HS so it can capture video and send it to the phone. I really find it hard to imagine all the processing power is going to fit in something you wear like that for quite a few years.</p>
<p>Wow now google will know everything that I&#8217;m doing. Where is the brain implant?</p>
<p>If it can just piggyback off of your phone&#8217;s data and information using very new/high profile bluetooth or such, then I see it as not being a problem at all in terms of it&#8217;s radio signals and your brain, because it would be no worse than a Bluetooth headset being on your ear all day.</p>
<p>This is what happens when your founder is a PHD</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about this. I&#8217;m kinda concerned. Brin goes off into special-projects land with no executive responsibilities, so what&#8217;s he doing? They said &#8220;Ok Sergey you have free rein. Do your thing. Go! Disrupt! Innovate!&#8221; and this is the only result after a year or more?<p>Not that project glass isn&#8217;t exciting and does seem to have market potential if executed well&#8230;and not that I could have done this in a year—but I was kinda expecting things that were more&#8230;disruptive. I just wonder what, if anything, else he&#8217;s been up to.</p></p>
<p>You have no idea what&#8217;s going on in Google&#8217;s X Labs. Most people don&#8217;t. They aren&#8217;t just going to spill out company secrets to people like you and me.</p>
<p>Yeah that&#8217;s my point. I have no idea. They could be getting stoned and playing Minecraft all day, or they could be building a high-energy particle accelerator underneath the Googleplex, we have no way of knowing except looking at things like this. And this is an impressive piece of tech with intriguing possibilites, but in the end it&#8217;s a high-tech toy; not a paradigm-defining disruptive technology (which is what Google Search is). I&#8217;m not demanding that Brin bring the future to me <em>now</em>, I&#8217;m just sayin&#8217;. He set the bar pretty high for himself.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what your point is.</p>
<p>This is the solution to &#8220;we want bigger screens but our pockets are too small&#8221; problem. We all knew it would eventually lead to this or implants. I can&#8217;t wait to see how we use glasses in combination with a small hand held device to do our computing and communicating. The next step after they get these working will be to use bone conduction technology for the audio so we don&#8217;t need earbuds.</p>
<p>ugh, i&#8217;ll probably have a really lame UI.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t hate the idea, it&#8217;s cool someone is doing it. Think it has a pretty long way to go before it really makes sense to implement though. Don&#8217;t like the one-eye Universal Soldier thing they&#8217;ve got going on. That seems pointlessly &#8220;Sci-fi&#8221;. Ideally a system like this would look like a regular pair of glasses and the display could work on either lens/eye or both simultaneously. I think it can make a lot of sense though in much the same way bluetooth headsets make a lot of sense. A good, tinted and polarized pair for driving would probably be great.</p>
<p>It is a little odd that this concept is being so widely embraced/praised while something like Siri or Kinect was so widely panned. Seems to me they are all in the same ballpark of sci-fi high concepts. &#8220;AI&#8221; personal assistant, fully motion controlled computing and eyewear-centric HUD. Maybe it&#8217;s because Glass is still vague and conceptual enough that we can still be hopeful/aspirational of how it might turn out, while Kinect and Siri both shipped already and reminded us that real-world tech isn&#8217;t quite &#8220;there&#8221; yet. Or tech dorks are just kind of fickle.</p>
<p>Just leave.</p>
<p>I like how Sergey says it feels &#8216;very useful&#8217; so far, and then goes on to says that all it really does right now is reboot.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Microsoft Project Courier. Cool video = Vapour-ware product</p>
<p>Except in this case the executives of Google want this product to succeed. So in other words, pretty damn big difference.</p>
<p><a href="http://connectingthecircles.blogspot.com/2012/04/through-looking-glass.html" target="_blank">http://connectingthecircles.blogspot.com/2012/04/through-looking-glass.html</a></p>
<p> These glasses are not just for Google to get hyperlocal tracking information, but a way to help them get a greater usage of Google Plus. In the promo video, everything that occurred was through one of the Google+ branded properties such as Google Music, Google Hangouts, Google Latitude, and Google+ identities. The other interesting thing about the video was that the entire product seemed to be tightly integrated &#8211; much tighter than that of Android devices. This seems to hint at Google&#8217;s development and implementation of a personal assistant, on a scale of Siri-like quality.</p>
<p>Have Matias design the UI</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s not considering this thing with a healthy amount of skepticism is setting themselves up for disappointment.</p>
<p>Hope there&#8217;s a way to attach it to a pair of glasses, or Google has a model for us to fix our own powered lenses onto.</p>
<p>This might be cool but if they open this up to manufacturers we seriously run the risk of being able to utter the phrase &#8220;I have TouchWiz on my face.&#8221; Not a world we should live in.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it ever taking off because people won&#8217;t want to wear glasses. In the future, everyone will have corrective Lasik surgery or genetic therapy to cure stigmatism. It&#8217;s anti-human to wear something like this all the time.</p>
<p>Seems a little low Rez. Wouldn&#8217;t that affect its ability to recognize objects and provide you with good info?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. The 3DS can recognize an AR card, lock down to it, and seek it off-axis and it just counts with (2) VGA cameras.<br />
Perhaps small, moving or too-far-away objects.<br />
I&#8217;m just waiting to see how that HUD works :3</p>
<p>Yeah it looks pretty awesome. Even if the camera isn&#8217;t AMAZING quality, it doesn&#8217;t change the hardware capabilities, nor is indicative of features of the end-product.</p>
<p>Somehow, I&#8217;m very optimistic about what Google has to offer with this project. I&#8217;m also <strong>dying</strong> to see more of the HUD. :P</p>
<p>Oh and also, somehow I think the camera that takes output video isn&#8217;t all that the glasses have for recognizing/analyzing the environment around you.</p>
<p>Amazing shot. There have plenty of times where I wished I could take a picture, but had no possible way of doing so.</p>
<p>Not true there are hundreds of photos like this that have been taken before. It&#8217;s actually fairly simple to do. That&#8217;s why I would have been more interested in a photo/video of this being taken along with the capture from the &#8216;device&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fairly simple to do&#8221; ORLLY?</p>
<p>You mean you don&#8217;t have a third arm?</p>
<p>Loser!</p>
<p>This was taken with a DSLR attached to a Gorillapod using the timer function. So yeah, pretty simple.<br />
<a href="http://flic.kr/p/bVNajm" target="_blank">http://flic.kr/p/bVNajm</a><br />
<img src="http://flic.kr/p/bVNajm" /></p>
<p>Yes&#8230;. Just in case you are going something that would look good on a photo you will have a Gorillapod attached to your body at all times&#8230;<br />
Read the original post and think if just plain &#8220;simple to do that&#8221; is actually a correct reply.</p>
<p>That child looks TERRIFIED!! LMAO..</p>
<p>Yes, very simple. I suppose you have never seen Gonzo Porn. Porn is way ahead of the game, always has been.</p>
<p>As for a still, which is a frame from a video&#8230;.</p>
<p>It would be cool perhaps if he selected the shot, typed in the website, logged in, uploaded the file, coded the table for positioning it and then wrote the content..all without hands or gestures.</p>
<p>yes, please do tell us a fairly simple way to do this without hands. Legions of beginner photographers like myself will thank you.</p>

Phone held under chin.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a video, not a picture. How do you press the shutter without using your hands, in a simple way?</p>
<p>Timer?</p>
<p>Timer still requires free hands.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/KmFyb" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/KmFyb</a></p>
<p>Not too difficult.</p>
<p>Awesome wallpaper.</p>
<p>You are right.  He probably didn&#8217;t take this with the glasses.</p>
<p>I am sure he did take it with the glasses.  Just saying it isn&#8217;t super difficult to do with a normal camera. Not trying to be negative either, this technology looks amazing and I can&#8217;t wait to try it.</p>
<p>Simple not same as convenient.</p>
<p>GoPro makes it really easy to do this sort of thing using one of the various mounts they make.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gopro.com" target="new"></a></p>
<p>If you are a hobbyist / professional photographer &#8230; sure.  A wearable hands free camera, with the world&#8217;s best viewfinder (aka direct eyeball), will make it way easier for the non pros.</p>
<p>If this catches on in a few years we&#8217;ll start seeing photos posted on Facebook of all kinds of stuff. Guy&#8217;s perspective when proposing, and her&#8217;s. View from roller coasters, rock climbing, mountain biking, etc. Could make Instagram a worthy investment as people just start taking pics of everything.</p>
<p>Two words, duct tape.</p>
<p>How do you press a shutter with duct tape?</p>
<p>THREE words, duct tape, and a monkey.<br />
ok five words.</p>
<p>will give a new perspective on &#8220;this is how we do it&#8221;</p>
<p>nasty</p>
<p>I thought taking shots or videos for product tear downs the way iFixIt does would be much easier if you could do them hands free.  That way the viewer could see exactly what it&#8217;ll look like if they have to dive screwdriver deep into their gadget.</p>
<p>Aww man&#8230; I am getting more and more anxious to see these demoed at Google IO!! Please take my money NOW!</p>
<p>Is this something they&#8217;ll license out, or do you think they&#8217;ll patent the crap out of it and make it exclusive to Android?</p>
<p>they&#8217;ll probably license out<br />
They&#8217;ll make money from it just having android features somehow.<br />
Ads and stuff i guess.</p>
<p>SMH, will yall give this ads joke a break? Google knows they won&#8217;t sell these blasting ads in front of your face all day. Just doesn&#8217;t even make sense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d assume that it would have it&#8217;s best integration features when paired with an Android phone or tablet over the competitors. It&#8217;ll probably connect over bluetooth, so it can become compatible with many devices.</p>
<p>not really a pop up ad but more of an AR type of ad.</p>
<p>And i don&#8217;t really mean blasting in your face ads but more of a rewards or even coupons, like maybe scan this barcode for discount and it&#8217;ll save in your google wallet or something. (something along that line)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they are even thinking about monetization at the moment.<br />
(Google may get most of it&#8217;s income from ads but they do have products/services with other monetization strategies)</p>
<p>I fully predict that Google glasses will be paired with, driven by, and exclusive to Android handset users.</p>
<p>I took this six months ago with my phone. Makes me think of that.<br />

<p>you held it in your mouth or what?</p>
<p>Duh, he duct taped it to his forehead.</p>
<p>Held under my chin.  I have another video where the phone fell (yay otterbox).</p>

<p>I was talking down the street yesterday and passed several of those &#8220;crazy only in New York&#8221; types I wanted to snap a photo of, but didn&#8217;t have the time, hands or guts to do it.</p>
<p>Imagine the fun of an almost stream of consciousness photo stream of everything you are walking by!</p>
<p>Also good for when you spot celebrities in bars and want to take a non-intrusive photo.</p>
<p>Of cours the possibilities for weird stalking, privacy invasion also sky-rocket.</p>
<p>and they&#8217;ll never suspect the person wearing the unusual eyewear ;)</p>
<p>Yeah, this definitely takes &#8220;the best camera is the one you have with you&#8221; to a whole new level. Awesome stuff!</p>
<p>those crazy only in new york types do it for attention so they don&#8217;t care if you take their picture.  Like a few months ago I saw a guy walking a goat&#8230; not even sure if that&#8217;s legal to have a goat in nyc.</p>
<p>This project will be as popular and successful as Google Wave, Wallet, Google Tv and of course not to mention Chrome OS.</p>
<p>me thinks you no know what you talk bout</p>
<p>Or maybe it will be as popular as Adwords, Gmail, Android, Gdocs, or Chrome browser</p>
<p>The question is &#8211; do you believe that? <br />
I&#8217; m veeery skeptical.</p>
<p>Skepticism is healthy. I did say &#8220;maybe&#8221;; really I was just trying to do a &#8220;see what I did there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah&#8230;you again.</p>
<p>Where can I get me one of them crystal balls you have? I&#8217;ll be honest and say that there is nothing I&#8217;ve read, or saw in the concept video, that made me think Glass would be any use, or solve any problems better than my phone, and therefore it&#8217;s not appealing in the slightest to me.</p>
<p>But I read somewhere recently that there are 7 billion people on Earth now and some of them might quite like it!</p>
<p>It probably won&#8217;t have any special use cause you have a smartphone.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;ll be fun for gaming thou.<br />
Or it can be a really annoying notification device.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and I reserve the right to change my immediately that I see something totally cool that wouldn&#8217;t work so well on a smartphone!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like apps &#8211; they&#8217;ve been around for donkey&#8217;s years on Palm and Windows Mobile devices but initially seemed a little lacklustre. What phone apps offered five years ago pales compared to what phone apps allow today &#8211; thinking iOS: Pages, Numbers, Keynotes, iPhote, iMovie &#8211; unbelievable!</p>
<p>And I have little doubt that the change in the way Glass will permit user/net/device interaction will allow a similar shift that is hard to predict now, as much as you couldn&#8217;t have predicted apps being so powerful on phones just five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>reads username</strong> Go back to Engadget.</p>
<p>Every company has had failures, look at Apple&#8217;s Ping or Microsoft&#8217;s Zune MP3 players for example.</p>
<p>weren&#8217;t they just sold? Viva la Verge</p>
<p>To be fair, this is clearly far from being a real product. Maybe it is like Chrome OS in that it is a great idea that it is a little before its time.</p>
<p>Even after all those failed projects Google still has the money and balls to fund crazy shit like self driving cars and glass.  They have their failures but they are not scared to innovate and thats why they&#8217;ve had big success like gmail / adwords / maps / chrome / android.  Comparatively no other company has dared to push the boundaries of modern tech like Google, looking at just where they failed is moot.</p>
<p>Imagine the movies that could be made through this. Finally, Halo can exist in movie form in exactly the way you play it.</p>
<p>Right, because a wearable camera is capable of shooting film quality video&#8230;</p>
<p>Editing saves films.</p>
<p>Well, at least I can be sure that you&#8217;re clueless.</p>
<p>Caption: &#8220;Help! Daddy I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>
<p>My first thought too!</p>
<p>&#8220;SAY IT, Android is <strong>NOT</strong> fragmented!!!  SAY ITTTTTT!&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d still never trust this system.</p>
<p>It seems it&#8217;s already reliable enough to use, as Googlers are already doing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the reliability, it&#8217;s the privacy.</p>
<p>Meh. You&#8217;re just too paranoid.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re not cautious enough. Everyone thinks differently and everyone will defend their privacy in a different way. Google isn&#8217;t known for keeping your information safe.</p>
<p>You have a point. Crazy people do act differently from non-crazy people.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite, that&#8217;s why they have so many users. Their users actually trust them with information.</p>
<p>Which is why Facebook has so many users too.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook derive all of their income based solely on the digest of the information they have on you. It&#8217;s in their best business interest to keep that information as far away from advertisers as possible.</p>
<p>Compared to Google, Facebook is a bit more lax about personal identities of &#8220;acquired clicks&#8221;(Well, the one&#8217;s that lead to a Like or Share or similar). Google, however, is very protective about the information about the &#8220;acquired clicks&#8221;. Twitter doesn&#8217;t even bother hiding that they are selling your information to third parties.</p>
<p>User count doesn&#8217;t mean anything.<br />
Facebook has hundreds of millions of users, and they are a walking privacy disaster.</p>
<p>How is this any less private than that 2 year smartphone contract you signed up for?</p>

<p>No, a number of overprotective white mothers are right there with ya. I&#8217;ve done this with my son millions of times. Ppl just need to use a little common sense, it&#8217;s all good.</p>
<p>"Project Glas, show me the way to the next suicide booth."</p>
<p>Reminds me of that reddit thread where the guy takes a picture of the tattoo on his wrists, then people ask how he took the picture and he takes a picture of himself taking a picture of himself, and it goes like 3 levels deeper.</p>
<p>Off-topic, but I&#8217;m curious: isn&#8217;t it a violation of copyright to post the image in full at the top of this post? Attribution isn&#8217;t enough, is it?</p>
<p>Depends. Arguably this is criticism of it, so it&#8217;s covered under fair use.</p>
<p>Hm. I agree that <strong>arguably</strong> it&#8217;s criticism. It seems like an explanation of it, as opposed to new thinking regarding it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, though. I teach middle school English, and I&#8217;m still trying to get a grip on the nuances of copyright so I can better teach my students.</p>
<p>all these comments and not one&#8230;</p>

<p>Go pro camera.</p>
<p>Anyone here know what a &#8220;creep shot&#8221; is? Creepy i know, but that&#8217;s honestly one of the first useful circumstances i can think of.</p>
<p>Given the practically absurd number of wearable cameras out there, this:</p>
<blockquote>but one that went up a few days ago most likely couldn&#8217;t have been taken with anything but Project Glass (see above).</blockquote>
<p>is more than a little sensationalist, no?</p>
<p>Is this patented like the iPhone was patented?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll patent red now.</p>
<p>Good question, because Apple has not been able to do much with their patents. Everything they bring to market is immediately ripped off and all those companies are still merrily selling them.</p>
<p>Either their lawyers are incompetent or patents don&#8217;t mean much in courts (only good for negotiations and barter).</p>
<p>Depends on how novel the patents are. A slide-to-lock mechanism is not novel. While AR glasses may not be novel, whatever frame they design may be sufficiently unique.</p>
<p>However, just because a patent is granted doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s valid. We&#8217;ve witnessed that far too often recently, with scores of patents from patent trolls being invalidated by courts.</p>
<p>I think we have different definitions of patent troll. A patent troll is  a company that never made anything and buys patents with the express purpose of making money off lawsuits. Suing doesn&#8217;t, in and of itself, make you a patent troll.</p>
<p>Surely there must have been something similar to this in movies/tv shows?</p>
<p>The thing with design patents is that they&#8217;re extremely specific. So only small &#8211; not insignificant, but small &#8211; alterations to what you see here and you could have yourself a whole &#8216;new&#8217; design to patent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a horribly flawed system, no matter what Nilay may say. ;)</p>
<p>Nilay is the first one saying Patents AS IT IS as room for improvement, but the solution is not banish them as proposed by &#8220;the internet&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe anyone is suggesting banishing them, that&#8217;s a straw man argument. Most people just want more oversight from the patent office, and for them to stop handing out patents to anyone with an outstretched arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;stop handing out patents to anyone with an outstretched arm&#8221; this is the kind of bold statement made by &#8220;the internet&#8221;</p>
<p>First of all how comes the handing patents to &#8220;anyone&#8221; with &#8220;outstretched arm&#8221;… I  mean, you really know WHY and HOW patents are being assigned? you think the patent office is filled by idiots giving out patents to anyone that bring in a nice draw?</p>
<p>Exactly. There was a case about someone designing a cooking pot and he patented it. The thing is, a larger company who makes similar products copied his design except that the handle was raised a fraction of an inch higher than the original design. He tried to sue but it&#8217;s a lost cause&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this AR type of glasses years ago being tested by the military.</p>
<p>Can anybody please explain me what could these be used for? Apart from taking a picture or a video&#8230;</p>
<p>Who knows&#8230;but it&#8217;s provocative!!!</p>
<p>it gets the people going.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never heard of Augmented reality?  Think about it- Google has a really compelling maps (and navigation) product, mix this in with the technology which has already existed for several years within the Google Goggles app (foreign language translation, barcode scanning, logo/mark recognition) not to mention the Google+ integration which is inevitable.  The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>you forgot ADS</p>
<p>inb4 Adblock+ for Google Glass</p>
<p>inb4 &#8220;we&#8217;re tired of fake-openness, we want our system to be closed to be profitable unlike Android&#8221;</p>
<p>You clearly don&#8217;t know how to root nor jailbreak.</p>
<p>Because all systems are vulnerable&#8230; right. Let&#8217;s tell that to the PS Vita/PlayStation 3.</p>
<p>The glasses won&#8217;t have ads, and its a misconception that Google wants to monetize everything.. Yes they are technically an advertising company but they have plenty of free services and experimental products that are ad free:  image search, news, drive/docs to name a few.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re ad-free but they help Google get more information about you to target you better on the other services that have ads.</p>
<p>Sure, but that&#8217;s a different discussion- my point was that Google would not be putting ads on the glasses.</p>
<p>how can be so sure about it? the product does not even exists!</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t put ads on ALL of their services. Have you seen ads on Android, per example?</p>
<p>first Android is not a &#8220;service&#8221; is an operating system that gives you access to services, and yes, google services has ADS</p>
<p>And Google galses glasess are services?</p>
<p>No are a device which will let you access google services, and google services are delivering ads</p>
<p>Some Google services deliver ads.</p>
<p>yeah, usually the most popular ones :)</p>
<p>Trolls already bringing up ads&#8230;this is turning into engadget.</p>
<p>if you criticize google you became a &#8220;troll&#8221; put your goggles on and enjoy your virtual reality google kid</p>
<p>Not sure how much concentration it&#8217;ll take by wearing this, as this may cause accidents.</p>
<p>For HUD of course: Compass, minimap, health, ammo count, you name it.</p>
<p>lol +1</p>
<p>hahaha</p>
<p>gps will have video chat to some extent since it has a camera facing out not stright to ur face, as of now pretty much anything your phone does but on your face lol, but whats really amazing is thinking what developers will make for this, and whats even crazier is imagine these a couple of years old, imagine holding something and it tells you everything you need to know about it just by looking at it,</p>
<p>ex. lets say you jump off a tree for w.e. reason you break a leg and then find next to you a plant that magicly heals you your glasses tell you what it is whats its name what it can do how it can help you ect ect. (i know it was something thats probably never gonna happen to you but hopfully you get it) or even walking down the street you look at something it looks good it shows you how much it cost and wheater you want to buy it you accept and then its sent to your house in a day or 2 and all you had to do was just look at it.</p>
<p>you&#8217;ve not seen a lot of science fiction, have you? Possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>everything you use your smartphone for you can use these for.</p>
<p>Helps you determine energy level.</p>
<p>(mine is over 9000)</p>
<p>IronMan or the Terminator seem to suggest interesting uses of a sort of HUD. <br />
Off the top of my head I could see these being useful in:</p>
<p>Measuring the interior of a room. Displaying and recording distances/wire frames of a walk through. (Architectural/construction/engineering)<br />
Heads up real time translation of street signs or map text, or even a book or manual.<br />
Shopping: real time price checks for local and internet vendors.<br />
Coupled with exercise equipment real time speeds/distances/heart rate/blood pressure.<br />
Watching a  sport could allow for real time stats via facial recognition.<br />
These may or may not be useful to some, but there can be real value to many.</p>
<p>Would make a pretty cool hud on a motorcycle.</p>
<p>problem is you need to buy a motorcycle</p>
<p>That side of it is nothing new. F1 drivers have had for a while and there are one son the market for bikes.<br />
One of the companies I work with does HUD for inspection divers.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s patent is only for the physical look of their device and is very easy to engineer around. There may be further patents covering the functionality of course</p>
<p>F1 drivers doesn&#8217;t have HUD&#8217;s on the helmet</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;I stopped reading after that. People pull shit out of their rears a lot more often nowadays&#8230;</p>
<p>The second design (without the lenses) is awesome.</p>
<p>Cool, can&#8217;t wait to see some Chinese company  making these in couple of months, because you can&#8217;t patent a glasses with a screen, just like you can&#8217;t patent a design of a phone, or a lock screen look and feel, or a row of icons &#8230; <strong>Right</strong> Google, Samsung, anyone?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for some Japanese company to get a hold of this!</p>
<p>This is just a rip off of Caprica&#8230;/s</p>
<p>It reminds me of the EyePhone.</p>
<p><img src="http://images.wikia.com/en.futurama/images/1/1e/EyePhone.png" /></p>
<p>the elegant gentlemen that like wearing a bluetooth headset at all times will be thrilled with this upgrade&#8230;</p>
<p>I remember seeing an IBM commercial of some guy wearing something similar to this buying and selling stocks.</p>
<p>I would love some Google Snowboard Goggles!</p>
<p>Its pointless for Google to patent this, Apple would never produce sunglasses with a dongle attached to the sides and when they do release their iGlasses Google will just think &#8220;shit, why didnt we think of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait till they have a sports version and I can get a HUD that gives me speed, distance, and splits for when I bike or run. There are so many things you can do with this kind of technology; it is very exciting.</p>
<p>A patent a day keeps the trolls away!!</p>
<p>Patented by Akira Toriyama.</p>
<p>Eh Google can patent the design all they want.  That glass element is super thick. You won&#8217;t be able to see through it. I also know that Google will have to infringe on a patent owned by a certain unnamed publicly traded company that holds the patents Google needs to make the glass work. I am on that project :). Lets just say there might be a  show down next year at CES, and Google may just get there GLAZZ handed to them!</p>
<p>Now, where&#8217;s all the people who cry foul at every Apple design patent for being a &#8220;black rectangle&#8221;.<br />
Can we expect them to whine about this basic glasses design patent with equal enthusiasm?</p>
<p>Google Glasses is promoting a product that so far does not exist. They have a way to go to be as successful as Color.</p>
<p>When did color become a successful product?</p>
<p>Chumkee is doing a pretty good job at making live sharing fun</p>
<p>Dear Google:</p>
<p>1. Get project Glass ready for consumers.<br />
2. Give G-Glasses to awesome athletes for free.<br />
3. ???<br />
4. PROFIT</p>
<p>BOOOOOOOOM FRANK LIGHTS &#8217;EM UP</p>
<p>It existed for the public to consume.</p>
<p>The day it launched, it became more successful than Color.</p>
<p>I think people are really underestimating the potential that Google Glass never comes to market, even. That said, Google Glass will probably blow passed Color in second 1 of their launch.</p>
<p>They shipped.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a way to go to be as successful as Color.&#8221;</p>
<p>hahaha best punchline i&#8217;ve ever read on the verge</p>
<p>Since he said that, I can only assume his entire post was meant as sarcasm.</p>
<p>More people want Google Glasses than have ever used Color. I&#8217;d call that success.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never even heard of Color before this article.</p>
<p>I think I remember it as the anti-privacy app.  Unless I&#8217;m confusing it with something else, it basically took your location and mingled any pics you took with those of everyone around you who used the same app.  I don&#8217;t recall anything about party photo albums, though&#8230; just cyberstalking.</p>
<p>And more people have seen GGlass on Charlie Rose than heard of Color.</p>
<p>Color was pushed HARD by TechCrunch and other VC-focused blogs. What they all forgot was</p>
<p>a) It wasn&#8217;t useful,<br />
b) it wasn&#8217;t fun,<br />
and <br />
c) To be either of these things it needed millions of users right away.</p>
<p>But with Arrington as the only person in techland who cared about it as anything more than a curiosity (thanks to the ridiculous $$ it raked in), it sank immediately.</p>
<p>Then it tried to recreate itself as something different &#8212; something replicating the functionality of a hundred other apps &#8212; and no one cared about that either.</p>
<p>On top of all that, the creator became famous as a buffoon ( <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1837096/the-startup-scarlet-letter" target="_blank">http://www.fastcompany.com/1837096/the-startup-scarlet-letter</a> ) so even it he had a good idea, it would become a joke anyway.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s poster child for venture capitalist failure and a laughingstock.</p>
<p>The only question is if it will make it to market.</p>
<p>Well they are selling developer versions to those who attended I/O for 1,500, and said that they are shooting for I believe a 2014 release date.  The tech seems to work, probably just about stability, UI, and price points now.</p>
<p>Color? I think Color had a major Hull Problem.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.geekstir.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/99problems-e1268090838951.jpg" /></p>
<p>Microsoft is also promoting a product that doesn&#8217;t exist.  The difference is that Google&#8217;s product worked and didn&#8217;t fail.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0lQ90.gif" /></p>
<p>Well, the camera part works. Over and over and over. So far I haven&#8217;t seen a damned thing beyond that.</p>
<p>Considering that a mainstream consumer product in a little less than 2 years away <em>at it&#8217;s earliest</em>, there&#8217;s probably a reason for that. It&#8217;s not ready.</p>
<p>Unlike their maps last week&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8217;tis.</p>
<p>:D</p>
<p>Noted troll Codernaut is showing signs of needing new material.</p>
<p>^ Forget Kony, Make Codernaut famous! (World Famous troll)</p>
<p>The market will open up, but no one cared about color till we just seen this..</p>
<p>People still give a damn about Google&#8217;s glasses. That&#8217;s not the same with Color, which got super hype out of the gate and was not able to capitalize and their pivots are way too confusing. Sorry. I like this skydiving thing though &#8211; its a clever &#8220;holy shit&#8221; type of moment. Some of the more creative social media viral marketing techniques I&#8217;ve seen involve a lot of inspiration actually, because these clever ideas take some thought, but then you&#8217;re right that it involves a consistent bit of real work. A lot of companies that have limited experience in social media think they&#8217;re the exception to the rule and they don&#8217;t have to consistently work on social media&#8230;they think that merely using some types of Facebook/Twitter ads or using the types of companies found at <a href="http://www.buyfacebookfansreviews.com" target="_blank">http://www.buyfacebookfansreviews.com</a> and then posting some content about themselves is all they have to do to achieve success. Wrong. The key to social media is empathy. Offer your users something that they value. Listen to them and find out what they like and don&#8217;t like about you and adjust and improve based on that. I don&#8217;t know that you necessarily have to keep a set schedule because if one day you can&#8217;t think of a witty Facebook comment or tweet its probably best to not say anything at all rather than post some fluff, but in the end its the consistent offering of content to people that they value and having some openness and empathy to your activity that will benefit you the most in the long run.</p>
<p>Can Color take off? Not without radically changing. I don&#8217;t know how they do that, but people are going to tune out almost anything their brand does because they&#8217;re tired of it.The sad thing here is that they do have a potentially game-changing product. It&#8217;s just that nobody will care.</p>
<p>&#8220;color&#8221; is a stupid name of a product nobody knows. Millions will want these when they are ready in 2014</p>
<p>Sorry but Google Glasses do exist.</p>
<p>Google Glass may not exist yet for consumers, BUT Google+ now has all the functionality that Color ever had, and it works simply, no Glass needed.</p>
<p>But Google Hangouts currently is, which allowed for this to happen in the first place.</p>
<p>tho fantastic, still i only see a limited use for this technology. We carry the cell phone everywhere, theres nothing those glasses can do my phone cant and i dont have to wear it. I think it will only works in places where u cant use your arms and hands to hold a phone for streaming.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it still require a phone for use outdoors? I didn&#8217;t think it had cellular built in&#8230;</p>
<p>take pictures/video/broadcast hands free I for starters.  I for one hate having to take my  phone out while walking to check an addresses, notification, screen a call, etc.  Assuming the consumer product price is reasonable and they can market against the creepiness factor I think it&#8217;ll do quite well.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you hate it that you still have to walk?</p>
<p>What price do you think is reasonable for this technology?</p>
<p>600 / 700. Any more and the convenience and simplicity is outweighed by the cell phone I bought for the same amount (off contact). <br />
Google should offer this through carriers. 300 on contact, bundled with a jetpack and Verizon 4g? Total win.</p>
<p>But you have to hold your phone. Its faster taking a picture with the glasses when you have them on. One day you may not carry a phone when your glasses can do the same.</p>
<p>What about put a map up in the corner of your vision so that you don&#8217;t have to look elsewhere for nav or directions? Or give you info on what you are looking at in an overlay? This is stuff that already exists through programs like google maps and Layar and would be super easy to integrate into these glasses.</p>
<p>I can see first person porn skyrocketing. That&#8217;s where the real ooohs and ahhs will come from :-)</p>
<p>I already see a few reasons to wear these.</p>
<p>1. EMT&#8217;s could wear them and it would send video feed back to an attending Doctor.<br />
2. SWAT could wear them when they breach a building and command would know who&#8217;s where and what they are looking at.</p>
<p>Those are only a few things just using Hangout that I could think of. Maybe a pilot is looking for somebody or something and then gets a signal to a location and if he had the glasses on it would show up on his screen the exact GPS location.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons this device would really work if it does what the supposive rumors say it could/should do.</p>
<p>Time will tell. Do I see myself wearing a pair? Probably not, but those that need them should.</p>
<p>The more I hear about Project Glass, the more I want it. My dumbglasses just don&#8217;t cut it any more.</p>
<p>I follow tech news on a minutely basis and I have heard of Color maybe once. I believe their failure is that they simply don&#8217;t advertise nearly enough.</p>
<p>Color = Colossal failure of communication.</p>
<p>the funny thing is, you can already do all that today with any smartphone without looking like a cyborg.</p>
<p>Really? Like riding a bike x-games style or doing rapel all with one hand? Come on&#8230;</p>
<p>A bit of duct tape and theeeere you go.</p>
<p>And what do you look like then with a phone duct taped to yourself?</p>
<p>Stupid, but not stupid enough to buy a $1500 glasses frame with a camera in it.</p>
<p>(<strong>silly</strong> would have been a more appropriate word*)</p>
<p>Agreed.  Except Google isn&#8217;t selling a $1500 headset to the public, nor do they intend to.  So it&#8217;s kinda silly to bash them for the cost of admission to the upcoming Glass &#8216;beta&#8217; for the developer community.</p>
<p>The consumer version, whenever it&#8217;s ready, won&#8217;t cost anywhere close to that.  Honestly, everyone on this forum and their brother already knows that a $1500 set of AR glasses would not stand a snowball&#8217;s chance at achieving mass market success, so why would anyone bother to imply that Google did not arrive at the same conclusion in evaluating price point targets?</p>
<p>I know this will probably sound unbelievable to you, but the first Qualcomm S4 developer previews that went out cost more than 10 grand.</p>
<p>How many 10 grand phones do you see walking around? It&#8217;s far, far more likely that these launch at 600 tops than anywhere near the 1500 developers are paying for it. (Having said that, I&#8217;d be more than happy to pay 1500 to get in on the potential cash cow that is Google Glass, especially if it will have it&#8217;s own market&#8230; because the first paid apps on the market will be huge money makers &#8211; like they were with the iPhone, iPad, Android, and every other relatively popular platform)</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t kid yourself<br />
you can barely wear glasses while riding bike x-game style.</p>
<p>you can&#8217;t be seriously arguing that a smart phone can do the same things&#8230; wake up buddy.</p>
<p>And yet, downhill MTBikers wear glasses for protection all the time.</p>
<p>Uh I have never lost a pair of sunglasses riding a bike. You know they make those things called straps that synch up to the back of your head to keep your glasses some what taught up against your head. Then you only have to lightly adjust them if needed.</p>
<p>Heck all the years of surfing, windsurfing, biking, hiking I&#8217;ve never lost a pair. Of course the only time I have is when I almost rolled a Jeep and they fell off my head. LOL  I didn&#8217;t think I needed to worry about them that day.</p>
<p>Yeah, but can you do it and still use both your hands?  Google glass is in part about putting  that capability in a device with a form factor that is remarkably unobtrusive to the user when it needs to be.</p>
<p>Yes of course you can, use a chest-mounted case for that POV perspective.</p>
<p>Even something as simple as this works: <a href="http://www.iphone" target="_blank">http://www.iphone</a> lanyard.com/Site/Stabilizer.html</p>
<p>some might say the cyborg glass is ridiculously obtrusive</p>
<p>And that group of people would be wrong.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that if someone wanted to stream from a first-person perspective with their smartphone, it&#8217;d look even more ridiculous. To be honest, I don&#8217;t even think Project glass makes you look ridiculous, and it actually looks okay when attached to a pair of glasses.</p>
<p>But again, it&#8217;s a prototype, so until the final product is out, no one know how silly you <em>may</em> look wearing Glass in its final form.</p>
<p>C&#8217;mon dude&#8230; Google Glass is so ugly! It would be MUCH more socially acceptable to strap your smartphone to your forehead for 1st-person video!</p>
<p>Anything you do with A, you can do with B but worse &#8211; yours is the attitude that won&#8217;t make you big money.</p>
<p>Some of us wouldn&#8217;t mind looking like a cyborg or having always-on hands-free access to the web.</p>
<p>Speaking of the original Color, why did they not show it being used at a rock concert, or a wedding?</p>
<p>Were you able to save all the pics, or did you just have to be in the space they were shot in?</p>
<p>Downloaded it on launch day. Never used it.</p>
<p>Nevermind, found it at Mashable:</p>
<p>&#8220;The app even has the ability to pull pictures that your friends took in the past, so long as you’re standing in the same location in which the pictures were taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even then, show a couple going back to an empty park and looking at all the photos friends shot of their wedding a year ago.</p>
<p>I think the biggest problem glass will have it it&#8217;s powersource.  Where will the battery go? Or will this just be a peripheral for your phone?</p>
<p>I think they can fit at least a 1000 mAh in the back of the glasses.</p>
<p>So run your cell phone battery down to about 50% and turn on the camera full-time and tell me how long that lasts. I sure hope Google Glass isn&#8217;t easy to break, because they&#8217;re probably going to spend a lot of time in peoples&#8217; pockets.</p>
<p>The screen takes alot of power because it&#8217;s so big, the glasses don&#8217;t need that much light/power.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/06/vicglass.jpg" /></p>
<p>Maybe it failed because the dev couldn&#8217;t spell colour&#8230;</p>
<p>At least it wasn&#8217;t spelled &#8220;colr.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helmetcams and whatnot have been around for ages. Once the novelty wears off, the footage does not look all that great even when the activity is exciting. Of course, most of us engage in exciting activities only infrequently. Hence Color&#8217;s lack of appeal when it focused on birthdays and parties. But even when it comes to exciting activities, once you see a couple of your friends skydiving a couple of times, how many more skydiving streams are you going to bother to watch?</p>
<p>In its current iteration, Google Glass is an effective marketing gimmick, not a product about to see wide adoption.</p>
<p>First person reality tv 2.0 meets POV porn &#8211; gets old pretty fast indeed. The reaction to the stunt performed by Google speaks oodles about how boring people have become. Can&#8217;t wait for people I know to stream their fear defying and life threatening activities and get the chance to see them die live&#8230; and see the last thing they were gazing at &#8211; maybe I&#8217;ll feel something, for once. Maybe I&#8217;ll ooh and ahh too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the Verge is the appropriate place to post your cry for help.  Better than 4chan, I&#8217;m sure, but that&#8217;s really something you should be talking to your therapist about.</p>
<p>You know they have a screen as well right? So that you can see stuff in the upper part of your vision like a map overlay etc. They are more than just a head mounted cam.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I said &#8220;in its current iteration&#8221;. The idea for heads-up AR is brilliant in and of itself. To get anything up on that screen in real time and in decent quality, however, will be difficult in the short- to medium-term.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why all the focus in the demos has always been on capture.</p>
<p>This is more than just a helmet cam though. This has potential to be the next major platform.</p>
<p>Right now, it&#8217;s a Google+ gimmick, but I can see real apps being written for this that make doing daily tasks much easier. Taking your phone out every time you want a smart app run is inconvenient.</p>
<p>For example, if you go to the grocery store, imagine if you could just look at a product and Google Glass could tell you all about it (if it fits in your diet, product reviews, etc). Or if you go to a toy store and you could see if a toy requires batteries or could be a choking hazard for a little child. I, personally, wouldn&#8217;t take my phone out every few seconds to look this kind of stuff up.</p>
<p>In the way that the Nokia 9000 reflected the potential fulfilled by the iPhone, sure. I fully agree that some form of AR-as-vision-overlay has astounding potential (provided we can work the functional quirks without needing to resort to retina or brain implants). That&#8217;s not what Google is showing right now, though. And it&#8217;s not the argument being made in the article, which compares Project Glass to Color. The glasses were not identifying SF landmarks or reporting distance-to-ground during the skydive. They were streaming POV video.</p>
<p>This article was the first time I had heard of Color.</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t</p>
<p>Yes, it really is.</p>
<p>It was my first time, too.</p>
<p>Why is Ray Romano taking a Google Keynote?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t even know that Color was a thing. The Google Glasses headset seems pretty freakin&#8217; awesome, although it&#8217;s a ways into the future. Always what I wanted from my eyeglasses.</p>
<p>Having guys jumping out of a plane wearing Cyclop&#8217;s visors, clearly saved the keynote although has nothing to do with their present products.</p>
<p>Well of course I&#8217;m not going to use a service that spells its own name wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s colour!</p>
<p>Did google in fact come out and say that the footage of the glasses demo was live?  Could it not have been shot earlier and then shown live using the actual tech?  Not much was revealed on how they got it working etc.</p>
<p>Gizmodo posted the behind the scenes info.  The Google Glass(es) were dummies.  All the video streams were from mini webcams mounted on the skydivers&#8217; heads.  Those streams were then broadcast and captured via parabolic antennas pointed at the divers.  Not so &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; after all.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve misread the Gizmodo article. It says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Skydivers wearing <strong>glorified miniaturized webcams</strong> mounted on fake eyeglasses and connected to wi-fi antennas jump off an aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the author&#8217;s shitty way of trying describe Google Glass.</p>
<p>The parabolic antennas are needed because there isn&#8217;t a service provider that would touch this before it launches (how the hell would they broadcast to the internet without internet feeds?)</p>
<p>Gizmodo is a shitty site anyways. Reading anything they say is a waste of time anymore.</p>
<p>I personally liked their first iteration/version. They jumped ship way to soon just like Milk&#8217;s Oink.  By the way has anyone had the chance of interviewing Kevin Rose after he left what taunted (Milk) for Google?</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  Color should have:</p>
<p>- Tied their service to a $1500 piece of potential vaporware<br />
- Done a product demo of people jumping out of an airplane, or scaling Everest, or some other video capture that&#8217;s been possible with traditional mounted cameras for the past five years or so.</p>
<p>&#8220;some other video capture that’s been possible with traditional mounted cameras for the past five years or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ok, tell me where I can watch those events happening live on my cell phone.</p>
<p>You can watch hangouts on air on the youtube app on your device.</p>
<p>Ustream, Livestream, Qik, Bambuser, etc. Live feed from a skydiver&#8217;s helmetcam or smartphone? Been done many, many times. Check a skydiving center&#8217;s website for their Ustream feed.</p>
<p>Bambuser is a popular live streaming app on almost all mobile platforms, in many countries worldwide, was banned in several Middle Eastern countries as to prevent televising the revolution, and can save the streams for later consumption. Just because Google does one thing in SF doesn&#8217;t make it future king when it has to dethrone a champion that is vastly ahead. It&#8217;s the money, stupid.</p>
<p>To clarify, only money can push Glasses forward, not a skydive.</p>

<p>Gizmodo posted the behind the scenes info. The Google Glass(es) were dummies. All the video streams were from mini webcams mounted on the skydivers’ heads. Those streams were then broadcast and captured via parabolic antennas pointed at the divers. Not so "revolutionary" after all.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see much &#8220;proof&#8221; there at all. Such is Gizmodo&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Never put Jesus Diaz, Gizmodo, and Android in 1 place.</p>
<p>these things are gonna be really bad.</p>
<p>Why would you assume that they&#8217;re going to be bad? You haven&#8217;t seen the hardware yet.</p>
<p>Maybe they mean badass.</p>

<p>Ummm&#8230; contacts?</p>
<p>Ummmm, I don&#8217;t like touching my eyes, or having things touching my eyes, or having a continual guaranteed expense to keep paying optical companies for contacts.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m slightly nearsighted. Putting contacts in for that all the time is only going to make it worse as my eyes get lazier. I only wear my glasses when I need to see far away (watching TV, Driving).</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn&#8217;t switch to contacts for this. For one thing, my prescription wouldn&#8217;t likely do any good.</p>
<p>&#8220;my eyes get lazier&#8221;. What kind of pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo is this?</p>
<p>Exactly why I have glasses; if I can pay to have the project fitted to my frame I&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>If not, I wouldn&#8217;t mind shelling out for some new ones. Of course, I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re going to buy a google made frame and insert lens of your choosing OR they&#8217;ll send out a standard for companies to use, or for us to go by when choosing our own frame.</p>
<p>either way, i&#8217;m getting some.</p>

<p>Am I the only one excited for Google Glass?</p>
<p>IM SO EXCITED. AND I JUST CANT HIDE IT. BUT IM A GHOST. OSHI&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>As long as they work with my glasses sign me up for a pair immediately they cant come to market soon enough.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s the nature of the internet to be cynical about things that they aren&#8217;t sure they can pull off.</p>
<p>3D Glasses aren&#8217;t great to wear over prescription glasses, so I would imagine Google&#8217;s Glasses won&#8217;t be much better.</p>
<p>even though they are totally different in every single aspect?</p>
<p>Their functions are different, but you are still wearing something over your glasses for presumably an extended period of time. What&#8217;s so different about that?</p>
<p>because this does not cover the entirety of your vision of even a single eye, and thus do not have to be worn over all of the set of glasses, or even one side.</p>
<p>I actually think this is the only way these are going to be socially accepted.</p>
<p>As always, the prophet that is <a href="http://iamnotrobot.com/post/20511534816/steve-jobs-take-on-googles-project-glass" target="new">Steve Jobs got it right on Google Glasses</a>:</p>
<blockquote>As soon as I saw the video for Google’s Project Glass I instantly recalled a funny story from my time at Apple. I was once at a Town Hall meeting in Cupertino where Steve Jobs commented on this type of wearable computing. An Apple employee in the audience asked Steve a question to the extent of: "How can we reach out to our leadership if we have a really good idea". Steve immediately put him on the spot and made him pitch the idea in front of everyone there. An opportunity to pitch Steve Jobs. What? The employee proceeded to pitch an idea about glasses you can wear that display various types of information. A heads up display a’la terminator cyborg vision if you will. He continued to explain how he wished he had a way to see projected information while he perhaps went for a run outside. Keep in mind this is happening in a room filled with a lot of people. Steve immediately shot his idea down and told the guy that he would probably trip and fall if that were the case. Steve also suggested he should get a girlfriend so he has someone to keep him company while running. I can not watch this Project Glass video without recalling this moment. So if you’re wondering what Steve would think about Project Glass, that’s pretty much it.</blockquote>
<p>who cares what he <em>would have</em> thought?</p>
<p>1. <em>Would have</em>  seems to imply that did not say this. Since it&#8217;s coming from an ex-Apple employee I would believe this.</p>
<p>2. The next time you build up a company twice from the ground up you can talk. It&#8217;s your opinion that doesn&#8217;t matter. Everyone from SV to Presidents cared what he thought. He mentored the Brin and Page. Who are you?</p>
<p>I know who you are. The village fool.</p>
<blockquote>As always, the prophet that is Steve Jobs got it right on Google Glasses</blockquote>
<p>He got it right? Oh I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t realize you already had an opportunity to try them out and indeed kept stumbling over your feet.<br />
News flash, the greatest ideas get shut down as crazy by people with no vision (no pun intended). Are Google Glasses going to be a great product? I don&#8217;t know, but neither do you, nor did Steve Jobs.</p>
<blockquote>Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you already had an opportunity to try them out</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever met regular people?</p>
<p>1. Imagine someone using this while driving in a car. <br />
2. Imagine a person reading message that pops up over the screen while they&#8217;re about to cross the street.</p>
<p>This can create all kinds of havoc. People don&#8217;t have the ability to concentrate on their eyes on two objects at once. The only people who do use this are heavily trained  military personnel. Even then they use it under very specific circumstances.</p>
<blockquote> Are Google Glasses going to be a great product? I don’t know</blockquote>
<p>That is a different question. Just because of the interference while driving the DMV will get into this. It will be the same for privacy advocates. I could easily see this getting banned in certain states. This is not even including that someone will be paying at least $250 to look ridiculous.</p>
<p>Have you seen a single picture of how these work, at all? They do not cover both eyes. They don&#8217;t even cover one eye. They are very much out of the way.</p>
<p>Or you know, you could just pause for a second doing whatever it is you&#8217;re doing at the moment and concentrate on the HUD. I know it sounds like crazy talk but apparently people do it all the time with these newfangled smartphones that they keep taking out of their pockets and diverting their attention to them.</p>
<p>Nobody said you&#8217;re suppose to just keep doing what you&#8217;re doing <em>and</em> read the HUD. And none of these messages are going to just pop up by themselves and block your entire vision. You get a small notification icon in the corner of your eye and you determine if and when you want to bring it up to open up the full message.</p>
<p>You know, when cars first appeared people thought it was crazy that a person could both pay attention to the road and control the wheel and the pedals at the same time, and then we added a gearshift on top of that. Yet somehow we&#8217;re still managing.</p>
<p>Nonsense. You imply that this is used all the time, much like smartphones. And I counter with all the idiots using their smartphones in traffic, causing accidents <strong>right now</strong>. The difference would be, that I have my eyes looking ahead instead of my head tilted down staring at my smartphone.</p>
<p>And even if you insist that it is not possible to focus on more than one object, it remains a fact that a healthy adult can read a text and at the same time perceive a car or person entering his field of vision from either side, drawing his or her attention. That, however, wont work with your head down, starring at the smartphone in front of your chest.</p>
<p>In other words, something like that will, when used responsibly, actually reduce accidents. Using it while driving a car is as wrong as using a smartphone.</p>
<p>Because people wouldn&#8217;t POSSIBLY be stupid or irresponsible enough to do something like stare at a screen to send text messages or make phone calls while doing something that requires as much attention as driving, despite mass media attention to the practice and warnings that such could result in&#8230;death.</p>
<p>&#8230;.Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Imagine someone using a cell phone wile driving a car. Imagine a person reading a text message that pops up while they&#8217;re about to cross the street — this would actually be preferable to that situation because instead of looking down at a screen you&#8217;re still able to see ahead of yourself, it&#8217;s a HUD.</p>
<p>I like apple too, but you are just a biased moron. You can&#8217;t judge if you never tried.</p>
<blockquote>News flash, the greatest ideas get shut down as crazy by people with no vision[.]</blockquote>
<p>No matter what you think about SJ. You can&#8217;t tell me that he was a man without vision. Please think before writing something like this, regardless of wether Google Glasses have a future or not.</p>
<p>Oh, put a period instead of a comma after the &#8220;SJ.&#8221; Of course I meant &#8220;comma.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prophet behind nobody want big phones, nobody cares about reading beyond 10 hrs, the subscription model of music is dead, don&#8217;t need dedicated apps, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Not saying he didn&#8217;t get plenty of things right, but he got almost just as many wrong.</p>
<p>1. People want cheap phones more than anything.<br />
2. He said nobody reads anymore. Ever notice how there are more stupid people today more than ever? Guess why.</p>
<blockquote>don’t need dedicated apps</blockquote>
<p>3. He never openly said this. From his perspective he actually wanted web apps. Most don&#8217;t understand this when they see the success of the App Store. He just didn&#8217;t want third party apps tainting his OS and creating instability. When he saw how popular native apps were, he used it as a way to crush competitors.</p>
<p>there are more stupid people because there are more people, period. In no way is humanity magically dumber than they were 80 or 100 years ago.</p>
<p>People still read, actually. Maybe you&#8217;re just surrounded by stupid people.</p>
<p>Just wondering. Was that &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; that Steve suggested finding meant to be a female entity named Siri?</p>
<p>Mind = blown.</p>
<p>He also said quite a lot of really stupid things. <br />
Like: &#8220;People don&#8217;t read&#8221;, &#8220;People will not buy big phones&#8221; and many, many more&#8230;</p>
<p>How do you know that this doesn&#8217;t fall into the stupid category? In fact, his latter management style wildly contradicts his 2005 Stanford speech.</p>
<p>Because staring down at your iPhone while walking is a lot better then looking up straight and being able to look anyone in the eye?</p>
<p>Also what a crude and humiliating thing to say to the guy who got up the courage to present his idea. Basically told him &#8220;Get a girlfriend you stupid nerd!&#8221; Hit the poor geek right where it hurts.. his love life. Sounds like very brutish, alpha-male behavior, and probably discouraged 100 other people with great ideas to step forward.</p>
<p>TIL there is a religious cult based on Jobs, and the founder reads the Verge.</p>
<p>Hi, I wear glasses and I find this to be a good question.</p>
<p>to the naysayers, &#8220;oh, that will NEVER work, IDIOTS!&#8221;, cmon, if you really really really think this is a shitty idea, then get this &#8211; <strong>you</strong> dont have to buy them! ;-P</p>
<p>RE &#8220;what about when you&#8217;re driving etc&#8221;, well, what about your smartphone and your laptop and your gun and your hatchet and your chefs knife, all dangerous possessions to be fiddling with while you drive, right?  So perhaps you <strong>shouldnt</strong> combine these items that you&#8217;ve bought, with the act of driving your car? :-)</p>
<p>I think this sounds like a fantastic idea, and greatly look forward to some version of it coming out in future, a couple of my friends dont have smartphones yet, I know, I know, I should disown them, right? ;-)  I say to them all the time &#8220;WHAT!  You dont have a smartphone!  How do you live?!?!?&#8221;, they keep saying they&#8217;ll eventually get an iPhone&#8230;.one day!  (they&#8217;re cheap enough to buy outright here, and run on prepaid, like mine)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a world where we all choose to use some form of Heads Up Display will be very different to a world without it, remember before people had earbuds?  Back when you had things called a &#8220;ghetto blaster&#8221;, people would walk around listening to tapes or the radio through a large &#8220;portable&#8221; audio device, with actual speakers on it, no headphones or earbuds involved, you just had competing loud music from everyone listening to one.  &quot;&#8230;.in my day Jimmy, Grandpa walked the streets of Brooklyn with his Ghetto Blaster, no no, not a raygun, we didnt have those until Google Zap came to be in the summer of 2015, noooooo, a Ghetto Blaster was a huge &#8220;portable&#8221; audio device, used to signal those you&#8217;re sexually attracted to&#8230;.like Grandma over there!&#8230;&#8230;..&quot;</p>
<p><img src="http://i3.squidoocdn.com/resize/squidoo_images/-1/lens15397481_1289726680ghetto-blaster.jpg" /></p>
<p>How often do you see people with earbuds walking around uptown, almost in a world of their own, perhaps most accurately, in our actual world, while also being &#8220;augmented&#8221; with sound, be it music, an audiobook or a podcast.</p>
<p>These Heads Up Displays are earbuds for your eyes, just as you can still hear with earbuds in, so can you see when you simply have one eye partially covered with a clear lens, which sometimes has information projected inside.</p>
<p>Of course, I expect it to be socially difficult to be the first Google Project Glass owner on your block, people constantly bashing you over the head with a brick to steal your 500 dollar digital monocle, and the Galaxy Nexus powering it, but I&#8217;m sure <strong>something</strong> like this will eventually catch on, perhaps only amongst the nerdy, in safe areas at first! :-)</p>
<p>Why do so many people seem to fail to grasp that Project Glass, as we&#8217;ve seen it at this point, in no way covers both eyes? they could easily fit when wearing glasses as well, and would not make it difficult to see.</p>
<p>Of course they&#8217;ll figure a way to make it clip onto your glasses.  It seems an easy enough design task.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll have to ban using Augmented Glasses and driving.<br />
No way would it be safe to be browsing Twitter while behind the wheel.  Even if it&#8217;s hands free.</p>
<p>To all the naysayers: <br />
Hey, this is supposed to be smart tech. So by the time it comes out, it will be easy enough to build in software to automatically detect when you are driving a car/crossing a road and shut itself off.</p>
<p>No, its not unfeasible even with current tech. All they need to do is borrow some features from the Google Smart Car.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re all forgetting that Google is really heavy into Robo Cars.Wouldn&#8217;t you in 10 years time when Google brings self-driving to the mass market, just put the car that you driving into auto-mode and just receive a call or read a sms&#8230;</p>
<p>You can always rely on someone to give you a chuckle on here.</p>

<p>Wearing a shirt would lower his creepiness by at least 30%. He couldn&#8217;t have that while promoting a device that records everyone 24/7.</p>
<p>Here he is with a shirt on.  Now&#8230;tell me how this makes you feel&#8230;</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, cannot unsee. Give me back the picture without the shirt, thanks, Dishonored needs its protagonist back.</p>

<p><em>THIS IS THE FUTURE.</em> We have no need for shirts here!</p>
<p>The more I read about Project Glass the more I&#8217;m convinced that this is the biggest flop Google has done since its launch. A close second to Wave and soon Google Plus.</p>
<p>This is not the future. This is what a movie about the future shot in 1995 would look like.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Google plus is a total flop. They are integrating more and more services into it all the time.   But I really hope project glass does come to something. But I&#8217;m just being optimistic.</p>
<blockquote>come to something</blockquote>
<p>What would be the major benefit?</p>
<p>The major benefit would be a permanent virtual-reality overlay.</p>
<p>You meet somebody. Their name hovers over their head, alongside links to social networks. You look at the facebook symbol. You immediately find out from their public profile that they&#8217;re into football. Now you have a few topics to talk about.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in a city you don&#8217;t know. You see a monument, and the name of the monument is hovering above it, alongside links to Wikipedia and other sources of information.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in your car. Navigation data is overlaid in your field of view. Without taking your eyes off the road, you see that you need to get off the highway in 10kms.</p>
<p>In short, you currently have a physical reality unfolding before your eyes and a virtual reality that resides in your computers. You need to get your smartphone out in order to connect to that virtual reality. Wearable computers can beam that virtual reality straight into your eyes at all times without the need to first get something out of your pocket. Google Glass and its ilk can make that virtual reality part of the physical reality, crushing the boundaries between them. The internet will become part of the real world as opposed to another world.</p>
<p>As always, innovation is vilified or ridiculed when it first occurs and only becomes mainstream after people acclimatize to it &#8211; smartphones were laughable nerd-badges when they were invented in the 90s and it took a decade (and a fashionable company entering the market) to make them mainstream.</p>
<p>In the case of wearable computers, I think they will only become mainstream when people aren&#8217;t required to walk around with something on their head. When the technology is miniaturized to the point where you can wear transparent screens like contact lenses, and perfected to the point where content analysis really lets you look at a landmark and immediately see what it is called, this will be the next big thing &#8211; and I really think it&#8217;s going to be the biggest thing since the internet itself.</p>
<p>Google Glass is only the first baby step in that direction. But even the greatest journeys always begin with a first step.</p>
<p>Best description I&#8217;ve ever heard. Bravo.</p>
<p>Just to play devils advocate:</p>
<blockquote>You meet somebody. Their name hovers over their head, alongside links to social networks. You look at the facebook symbol. You immediately find out from their public profile that they’re into football. Now you have a few topics to talk about.</blockquote>
<p>Possible, and could be useful, but for that to be a reality, barriers like privacy and social norms will have to be overcome. I don&#8217;t know that lack of conversation topics is a major issue for a lot of people.</p>
<blockquote>You’re in a city you don’t know. You see a monument, and the name of the monument is hovering above it, alongside links to Wikipedia and other sources of information.</blockquote>
<p>This would be useful in some circumstances, but why would it need to be wearable? This is possible with current smartphones, the databases just need better datasets for recognition of objects.</p>
<blockquote>You’re in your car. Navigation data is overlaid in your field of view. Without taking your eyes off the road, you see that you need to get off the highway in 10kms.</blockquote>
<p>So I still have to drive? Wouldn&#8217;t the car just respond to a voice command and take me somewhere? This is possible with current technology too and what is the advantage of having this as wearable technology?</p>
<p>I guess I wasn&#8217;t convinced by the Google video that they showed as a use case, it just didn&#8217;t feel like there was a &#8216;killer app&#8217; for it, and it glossed over the privacy and surveillance implications entirely.</p>
<p>I can see that it would be useful, but how long until we have contact lenses that can do this? I&#8217;d suggest a long time, and in the mean time the smart phone might remain the main computing device people carry with them. The main advantage of this form is that it goes back into the pocket when necessary.</p>
<p>lol. You think a prototype is a total flop?</p>
<p>Well said. it looks great fun, but people cringe at using a tablet as a point and shoot camera in public. You think people aren&#8217;t going to be completely creeped out by this sort of device..?</p>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re Sheldon from BBT, the answer is no. It doesn&#8217;t help that Dr. Steve Mann, while brilliant, seems to be a terrible poster boy for this, which he is insisting on becoming. All the product placement they&#8217;ve been doing around Fashion Week, etc is completely undone when you see pictures like the ones above.</p>
<p>Dennou Coil, here we come.</p>
<p><a href="http://falkvinge.net/2012/09/07/three-reasons-child-porn-must-be-re-legalized-in-the-coming-decade/">Three reasons child porn must be re-legalized in the coming decade.</a> Surveillance by individuals seems awesome, but it&#8217;s also a double edged sword. Just chilling with your Google glass and accidentally see something that&#8217;s illegal to record and broadcast? Off to prison.</p>
<p>Dude, <em>what?</em> Last I checked, most people don&#8217;t just &#8220;accidentally&#8221; stumble across children being sexually abused/exploited in their day to day lives..  If that&#8217;s a common occurrence for you, maybe you should consider calling the police.  Seriously, WTF?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very hyperbolic fictional situation and I heard the writer is infamous for that scaremongering style. But still, it&#8217;s a plausible scenario that could happen to anyone not living in orderly utopian first world middle class cisgender white cityscape.</p>
<p>Laws evolve&#8230;</p>
<p>They need a trigger first, like first few unwitting victims.</p>
<p>laws evolve extremely slowly&#8230;.</p>
<p>No, it makes sense.</p>
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re at the lake, taking a swim in balmy November 2035. Your Google Eyes contact lenses film everything you do and automatically send all the video to your 50 exabyte cloud storage (which you need to expand soon, damn) because you&#8217;re one of those life-filming hipsters.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just chilling at the shore and looking around. Somewhere, a mother is undressing her 3-year-old and putting his swimming trunks on. A few yards further in the background, a naked baby is happily crawling in the grass. You never even notice. Google Eyes does.</p>
<p>Half a year later, the police does a routine check of your collected video (under an anti-terrorism law mandating all sorts of personal and electronic searches that passed Congress under a Republican President in the 2020s) and bam! video of naked toddlers. Child Porn.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what he meant &#8211; and if he didn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s what I mean. If these things ever become mainstream, the laws would in fact need to be amended for the new situation in order to save innocent people from going to jail over coincidences while still making sure that REAL child porn gets prosecuted.</p>
<p>Now what sort of country think that a video where a toddler is wandering naked in the background is child porn &#8230;</p>
<p>United States of America.</p>
<p>If (and this is troubling for me) you equate nudity with sexual exploitation, then it&#8217;s more likely that Google will filter it so you won&#8217;t even see nudity.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be using the &#8216;Safe Vision&#8217; settings in your preferences that stop you seeing anything troubling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not equating nudity with sexual exploitation at all. The fact remains that if los federales find pictures of child nudity on your computer, you&#8217;re in for quite the ride.</p>
<p>Sounds like Earth.</p>
<p>Deus Ex implants, coming soon!</p>
<p>We can only hope for such an advanced future to arrive soon.</p>
<p>In 1800, farmers were basically using all the same technologies as their ancestors did in 1500. In 1930, cars were plentiful but not commonplace. In 1940, a computer with much less power than a contemporary dollar-store calculator were filling entire assembly halls. In 1950, space travel was considered science fiction. In 1960, people couldn&#8217;t imagine how mobile telephony would work &#8211; surely you can&#8217;t carry a few miles of cable with you at any time, and using radio would bog down the frequencies too much and cause interference.</p>
<p>50 years later, everybody has a car (but not enough petroleum to fuel them all for much longer), everybody has a smartphone giving them access to the world&#8217;s information at their fingertips, and space tourism is slowly starting to become a realistic proposition.</p>
<p>If we have full-on Deus Ex implants by 2060, I&#8217;d say that would be a pretty quick pace of innovation, even if I&#8217;m almost 80 by then. But going by the rate of innovation in recent decades, we&#8217;ll probably be there a bit sooner.</p>
<p>I guess people always say this before a new technology is introduced, but I can&#8217;t imagine these glasses becoming very popular. Even among people who already wear glasses, these are going to look out of place, un-symmetrical and will draw attention to themselves. And for people who don&#8217;t already wear glasses, they&#8217;ll feel even weirder to wear.</p>
<p>I can see that being able to get information easily without having to look at a separate screen might be useful, but enough to wear these things over the face? I&#8217;m sceptical.</p>
<p>The thing is that the underlying software technologies don&#8217;t need the glasses. The glasses are just the only way to implement the whole idea at this point in time, letting developers tweak the software. When the technology reaches a stage where you don&#8217;t need the glasses, the software will be ready for prime time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly sure that&#8217;s the reason why Google Glass exists right now. Getting into the game before it even starts. Google Glass is just a warm-up (and it should be noted again that it&#8217;s not a consumer product. Google knows that it&#8217;s not attractive to consumers right now. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that the basic idea of field-of-vision computing won&#8217;t be attractive in the future.)</p>
<p>A wireless power- OLED/Nano Laser Diode projector contact lens with adaptive inter-ocular projection is already under development: for the discretion aspect of wearing the display: although that technology is classified and I cannot even mention who or what is developing it if I want to continue being able to use my internet connection&#8230;&#8230;if you think anti-net-neutrality is bad, you have seen anything worth fearing yet&#8230;lol</p>
<p>Who would ever want one of these in their home? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC</a></p>
<p>Fair point, and I guess the ideal is that the glasses are invisible, or so small as to be overlooked easily, but we&#8217;re still a way from that being possible.</p>
<p>This will help to solve more crimes because people often casually overlook something their eye see while distracted thinking about something else. Is that person breaking into their own car because they lost their keys or is it a crime? Slim-jim</p>
<p>In traffic this would be the best. Every bad driver I see would be recorded driving poorly, and there would be loads of evidence. Where I live a huge fraction of drivers drive like they are intoxicated (perhaps many of them are, although I notice other patterns with bad drivers- notably phone use: who tend to do worse than the DUI ones I spot leaving bars&#8230;..</p>
<p>The whole issue of accidentally recording nudity in public is a non-issue. Any nudity in public is a form of exhibitionism and is already illegal in most countries. Furthermore built in &#8220;safe record&#8221; features would fuzz out the recording of anything the analytical software on the cloud deemed inappropriate, unless that was legitimate &#8220;stuff&#8221; you were recording with your sexual partner: this issue of cloud privacy brings up what the Woz was saying about not owning your data and putting it on a cloud&#8230; think about it carefully.</p>
<p>Furthermore wearable cameras already exist&gt; &#8220;Pivothead&#8217;s products $349&#8221; for example. And no shortage of Go Pro and Go Pro alternatives. I have a camera shooting time-lapse in my car window to catch bad drivers in the act&#8230;.. 1 frame per second at eq to 4K resolution when turned into a video :)</p>
<p>This is just blending a smartphone (MID, wearable computer)  with a head-mounted camera/ display. I think the latest Go Pro&#8217;s have built in wifi anyway.</p>
<p>No shortage of people spreading FUD about Project Glass : <br />
FUD_ Fear Uncertainty and Doubt</p>
<p>There are naysayers and pundits that will bash and condemn/ judge/ mud sling/ insult/ downplay or otherwise dismiss almost anything from trivial to revolutionary. Telsa&#8217;s peers wrote him off as nutty: we enjoy AC power now as a result of his forward thinking vision that his idiot peers didn&#8217;t understand. Woot Woot Nikola Tesla ^^ and Tesla Motors :)</p>
<p>Does she come with a purchase of GGlass or&#8230;.no?</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>k</p>
<p>The shipping costs would be horrendous.</p>
<p>I think just the pre-orders.</p>
<p>one can wish :/</p>
<p>Oh you, tehehehe.</p>
<p>Sure she does!  Just use her photo as your &#8216;background image&#8217; and you will then have her with you everywhere you go :-)</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>So, how come this patent takes just under a year to be granted, but the notifications slider one is still being validated after 4 or so years?</p>
<p>Because the patent system is FUBAR.</p>
<p>Expedition costs.</p>
<p>Without being dense&#8230; what&#8217;s one of those?</p>
<p>The cost of mounting an expedition to the Antarctic to consult the Great Old Ones and get determination of the patent&#8217;s validity.</p>
<p>rofl<br />
you sir, just made my day</p>
<p>The cost to expedite review.  Still, I&#8217;d like to see the application date to see if it was really granted within a year.  That would be downright incredible.</p>
<p>Actually it was filed in September 2011.  Apparently, Google has a friend at the USPTO who put this on top of his queue.  If Apple had that option they should have done that for tons of their iPhone-related patents in 2007.  I&#8217;ve never seen a software patent issue that quickly.</p>
<p>yaaay&#8230; world on the blink of your eyes!</p>
<p>Am I the only glasses wearer who thinks that having the majority of the weight on one side an issue? Not only for day-to-day comfort, but the eventual bending and distortion of the temple arms and nose pieces?</p>
<p>Not to mention lopsided tunnel vision</p>
<p>I would think there is some sort of counter weight.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t know for sure until they are actually available to the public, but from early reviews by people who have used them for extended periods, they are actually quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Maybe the other side is made of extremely dense metal, like osmium, that acts as a counterbalance.</p>
<p>Smart because some corporation was trolling.</p>
<p>Who new &#8220;Product so hideous that no one would ever want to steal it&#8221; is a patentable idea. Brilliant!</p>
<p>knew* gah</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;While it won&#8217;t stop anyone from actually taking the device, the software lock will work to protect personal data and quickly alert the police.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Oh man, I was really hoping Google was secretly creating a race of Cyborgs disguised as a defensive anti-theift system.</p>
<p>Someone tries to steal them, glasses activate unleashing prongs that enter the skull attaching to the brain and creating a DNA link that prevents the glasses from ever being removed. The link allows two-way communication between the brain and the glasses.  Only downside, 24/7 exposure to ads and no blocker</p>
<p>Anybody carrying a stolen headset should be located by gps and the person outlined in red on nearby Glass wearers headsets.</p>
<p>Nerd attack!!!</p>
<p>Lol, I can just imagine all these nerds trying to beat up a thief, but ultimately failing. Also, if you were wearing stolen glasses wouldn&#8217;t you just avoid people with glasses&#8230;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the Girl who used to be on that show Wipeout?</p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>No outrage over this patent eh? I guess it&#8217;s ok as long as Google is allowed to steal from everyone else.</p>
<p>You trolln but let&#8217;s have it: What about this patent says stolen to you?</p>
<p>Someone asking a question isn&#8217;t trolling. It isn&#8217;t a coincidence that The Verge released two patent stories within 15 minutes of each other that had to do with patents by Google and Apple. Take a look at the difference between each comment section.</p>
<blockquote>What about this patent says stolen to you?</blockquote>
<p>When did I say Google stole this patent?</p>
<blockquote> I guess it’s ok as long as Google is allowed to steal from everyone else.</blockquote>
<p>Right there?</p>
<p>he&#8217;s got a point though, every single Apple Patent is declared invalid by the apple haters.</p>
<p><strong>slow clap</strong></p>
<p>Patents get issued every Tuesday so it ends up being a hot day for patent news. That&#8217;s really all there is to it.</p>
<p>Apple does have patents on software being used on mobile devices to determine if the device is being stolen by monitoring the hardware. But, all Apple patents are non-innovating and just patent trolling, so Google gets this one, I guess.</p>
<p>What are the chances a hottie like that would ever be caught dead wearing Project Glass (outside of a paid model of course).</p>
<p>same thing would have been said about videogames or just computers in general in the 90s. Things change.</p>
<p>LOL, Things change? and how many hotties play videogames now? and what techie things do they use computers for?</p>
<p>I wouldnt count Facebook as &#8220;things change&#8221; in this scenario, if FB was through TV then that is where the hotties would use it through.</p>
<p>One iJustine is enough tbh :)</p>
<p>Maybe Google will pay some hotties to wear them around until the stigma is gone. I was watching something about shopping carts (lame, I know) where grocery stores paid &#8220;actors&#8221; to walk around using shopping carts when they were first introduced because actual shoppers didn&#8217;t want to appear weak or stupid for using the carts instead of the standard baskets. Not likely&#8230; but #funfact.</p>
<p>Ask all the hottie Google engineers that actually work on the product and were wearing it all over the place at I/O</p>
<p>But, aren&#8217;t patents = bad and Google = good?</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t you heard?  It is okay for Google to get patents awarded, just not Apple.  Go to the comments on the Apple auto-hiding touch-scroll indicator and you will see the Android advocates have come out in droves.  There are only 40 or so comments here with hundreds over in the other article.</p>
<p>The other article is full of people spouting off about how Apple&#8217;s mobile innovations are not innovations and should be part of the public domain.  These are the same people who claim the &#8220;Apple Fanboys&#8221; have taken over The Verge.  If you look at the comments on these two articles, it tells a very different story.</p>
<p>Personally, I think both patents are solid patents.  Google did a better of job of getting their&#8217;s issued sooner.  Apple could have used their patent back in 2008, but in 2012 they are going to fight an uphill battle to get folks to recognize their patent as a distinct feature of Apple devices.</p>
<p>Especially since both, really, are software patents.  In the case of the glasses, the patent might be something like how the software can tell the difference between someone trying to steal the glasses vs when the wearer is just jumping off of a step.  In both cases you are relying on the same sensors.</p>
<p>I think this is a (Mostly) solid patent. I don&#8217;t think changing the color of something on a (touch) screen to make it disappear is a solid patent.</p>
<p>The notifying the authorities shouldn&#8217;t be in the patent IMO.</p>
<p>Go pick up any Palm OS or Windows Mobile device and try out their touch sensitive scroll bars that you interact with via a stylus.  Apple&#8217;s touch scroll with overlaid scrollbar is far superior.  This patent only covers the disappearing overlay scrollbar when touch scrolling is used (not touch scrolling itself), but is clearly a great adaptation on the scroll indicators.</p>
<p>Not a fan of software patents, but this is at least a little more innovative than a scrollbar patent. I hate UX patents because they are too damn broad. At least this is restricted to glasses and a very narrow use case. Still not sure how I feel about it though. Would like to see an end to all such patents honestly. If Google ever uses a patent like this the way Apple does, I&#8217;ll definitely be pissed.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to be all smooth and take off your glasses in a swift, studly-type, Top Gun-style motion.</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of motion indicates thievery.  because, it would not be good if it started notify in the police everytime somebody  dropped their pair of Google Glasses.</p>
<p>I think Google would have to test this feature a LOT before they start rolling it out.</p>
<p>nice</p>
<p>As clumsy as I can be, I&#8217;ll have the police busting down my door every fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3XoqV.gif" /></p>
<p>Shame that it is so obviously fake :-(</p>
<p>stop trolling trollzor</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry but that is undoubtedly fake.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Google doesn&#8217;t have any 3rd party APIs for sharing content on G+.</p>
<p>Hand-wavey, but most likely not fake. None of the tasks performed were that difficult to code or program for.</p>
<p>it might not have actually done anything with the photo, but it did capture it and give options on what you could do with it.</p>
<p>Fake&#8230; he shared something on G+.</p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>One of the YouTube commenters actually has a valid point. Google+ doesn&#8217;t have a public API yet, so how us he accomplishing this? Is he scripting the share intent in Android somehow? Otherwise this appears to be pretty damning evidence against this project.</p>
<p>The video doesn&#8217;t actually show him sharing to Google+, just that he started an action to do that. For all we know, nothing actually happens (because there is no public API ;))</p>
<p>That actually didnt cross my mind. So, basically he just feed in some queries and their answers. Nice.</p>
<p>Not necessarily:  there is an unofficial/&#8220;hack&#8221; API out there that supposedly can post to Google+ : <a href="https://github.com/mohamedmansour/google-plus-extension-jsapi" target="_blank">https://github.com/mohamedmansour/google-plus-extension-jsapi</a></p>
<p>By the way, this idea (and realization is 30+ years old.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann</a></p>
<p>Well in that case, Google had better stop what they&#8217;re doing and let this guy continue to not sell me his products, just like he&#8217;s done for the last 30+ years.</p>
<p>Although to be fair, I only existed for 24 of those.</p>
<p>Yes, and smartphones existed 10 years before the iPhone, and multitouch technology for 20 years before the iPhone. Your point?</p>
<p>An idea is worthless by itself. What gives it value is a great practical implementation that can actually be used by people and sold into the market.</p>
<p>sometimes future is exciting again. like 1990s</p>
<p>The dream of the 90s is alive in Portland.<br />

<p>I <strong><em>love</em></strong> the idea of augmented reality, but I don&#8217;t think voice control is the way forward. Generally, talking to yourself is frowned upon in society and I don&#8217;t fancy listening to teenagers compose text messages aloud to their  boyfriend while I&#8217;m on the bus.</p>
<p>I kind of agree, but if everyone was doing it, it would become socially acceptable, and id assume that you could draw out the noise of the talking teenager with your own Glasses, either playing music or noise cancellation for the effect of silence.</p>
<p>After all, what else can you really do? Gestures? then we will all just become mimes. You couldn&#8217;t walk down the street without doing some kind of dance to check the weather, or when you were on the bus everyone would just be silently waving their arms about.</p>
<p>However they do it, it has to be hands free, and if its hand free, its going to be weird, because you need to interact with it alot, so you&#8217;ll be doing alot of whatever it is you do to control it. (i hope that makes sense&#8230;)</p>
<p>when i read his comment, i was more like, maybe in the near, or far, future, you&#8217;d think commands.</p>
<p>so you <em>think</em>, instead of speak&#8230;.</p>
<p>i know it&#8217;s still very science fictiony, but science amazes us sometimes, sometimes it&#8217;s so amazing that trolls can&#8217;t believe it</p>
<p>+1 for think commands.</p>
<p>Still not sold on voice commands:<br />
Me &#8220;text steve&#8221;<br />
Glasses &#8220;texting Steve, say your message&#8221;<br />
Me &quot;this meeting is horrific, I hope there&#8217;s a natural disaster just so I can get away from these idiots, hopefully some of them die at the same time &quot;<br />
Glasses &#8220;sending message&#8221;<br />
My Boss &#8220;You&#8217;re fired. Glasses; email security to escort him from the building, rough him up a bit&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder how eye tracking would work for an augmented reality keyboard, i.e. look at a letter to type&#8230; actually that would be awful with a qwerty design. I&#8217;m sure someone could think-up a better eye tracking text input system&#8230;</p>
<p>+1 for eyetracking.<br />
 There&#8217;s a technology already to use onscreen keyboards and control cursors using eyetracking, it should be easily transfered to HUD display (since HUD spans wider over your field of view than a computer display and you measure only angular movement).</p>
<p>think commands are way too difficult to calibrate properly and could result in many false or involuntary inputs.<br />
Granted, this may happen with involuntary eye movement as well, but you can failproof it using double-blink or something for confirming operations.</p>
<p>We could blink Morse code.</p>
<p>It can&#8217;t be done today but I think subvocalization could be used.</p>
<p>I guess it would be certainly easier than mapping one&#8217;s thoughts, but I still think eyetracking is the most reliable solution.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t talking on a smartphone in public the same thing? Does having to hold your hand next to your ear make that much of a difference? I think we&#8217;ve just gotten used to it because it became so useful, and everyone is doing it. When everyone does something, it&#8217;s not silly anymore.</p>
<p>I think utilising voice recognition itself is not a problem so much. It&#8217;s the way you do it.<br />
I&#8217;m all for <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/08/03/natural-user-interface-red-herring-dyson-sphere/">Paul Miller&#8217;s &#8216;dyson sphere&#8217; concept </a> where the device captures our normal, everyday conversations and other &#8216;voice output&#8217;, combines it with other data (visual, eyetracking, geolocation etc) and, probably based on some behavioral pattern it learns over time, acts accordingly. So the device <strong>knows</strong> to add a meeting or event to the calendar based on the conversation, reminds us if we forget something we take with us everyday, etc</p>
<p>To speak simpler &#8211;  it should minimise not only direct &#8216;Computer &#8211; do that&#8217; Siri-esque voice commands, but <strong>any</strong> direct commands whatsoever. But I guess this requires far more advanced AI than we currently have.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait til these things plug into a thunderbolt port in the back of my neck and interface directly with my brain. You know that&#8217;s the next step.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t wait to plug a device into your brain that&#8217;s made by a greedy consumer tech company,made with the cheapest possible materials and assembled by a severely underpaid chinese worker,  hey, knock yourself off. Personally i think i&#8217;ll pass.</p>
<p>Voice commands doesn&#8217;t make much sense in practical usage &#8211; the reason googles concept video was so interesting is that the glasses were aware of where you were and what you were doing &#8211; if you look out the window it tells you the weather, if you are in a bookstore it recommends some books &#8211; that&#8217;s the key.</p>

<p>This is so cool. I want, so bad.</p>
<p>I thought the whole point of this was something that could be completely hands-free. What happened to the voice control? Eye-tracking? Head -jerking? ANYTHING would be better than to have to always bring your hand up all the way to your head!</p>
<blockquote> than to have to <strong>always</strong> bring your hand up all the way to your head</blockquote>
<p>Always, wah?</p>
<p>if it employed eye tracking for scrolling, that would be insane!</p>
<p>I seriously want eye-tracking for scrolling. Although the cases where it would be easiest to implement, like long-form reading, would not really be something I&#8217;d do on Glass.</p>
<p><strong>scrolling gmap on project glass</strong><br />
<strong>when suddenly, wild chick pass by</strong><br />
ow, look, hot chick!<br />
<strong>aw, snap!, I scrolled too far. Where was I point my gmap at?</strong></p>
<p>sorry for grammar mistake, English is not my first language:D</p>
<p>no problem&#8230; but stop making these stupid joke.</p>
<p>Not trying to be patronizing, but I don&#8217;t think you understand how complicated something like eye tracking would be for an always on, hands free device.</p>
<p>1. Tracking software would require constant processing, destroying any battery you may dream to have processing huge amounts of data in order to do this at a bearable speed. There would be ways to cut down the amount of data that would need to be processed, but it still requires far more data than what is acceptable for a battery powered device. This is why devices like Kinect and other tracking hardware have built in separate processors to do this. And when this device is likely being powered by the phone for processing (maybe I&#8217;m wrong about that), but my point still stands, battery is far too scarce to be used constantly for tracking eye gestures.</p>
<p>2. The tracking software would also need a way to differentiate between normal eye movements, and eye movements intended for controlling the glasses. And simply stated, there is no real way of doing that hand&#8217;s free.</p>
<p>3. User experience is not great when using a mouse as a cursor like you are describing. The idea sounds cool, but in practice, human brains are not built to naturally know how to do that and it won&#8217;t be pleasant to operate something in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel natural. We are very good at using our hands to do things, but we have very limited control in performing specific eye movements  without confusing the device with our wondering eyes.</p>
<blockquote>Eye-tracking? Head -jerking? ANYTHING would be better than to have to always bring your hand up all the way to your head!</blockquote>
<p>This would just lead to a bunch of distracted, twitchy eyed, blinking zombies running around&#8230;</p>
<p>Did anybody else start touching the side of their glasses to see what this would be like?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wear glasses, but i did touch the side of my head&#8230;</p>
<p>I just did. It doesn&#8217;t feel bad or awkward.</p>
<p>The google courier&#8230;</p>
<p>Interesting that Google got the application examined and issued in just over a year. That&#8217;s incredibly fast for the US Patent Office. One reason: the claims are relatively narrow.</p>
<p>However, Google filed a &#8220;continuation&#8221; application before this one issued so it can go after additional, and potentially broader, coverage in a second patent related to this one.</p>
<p>As silly as the move might seem, I think it&#8217;s a nice way to let other users know that you&#8217;re taking a picture.  As excited as I am about the glasses, I&#8217;ve been worried that it would dramatically increase the number of surreptitious photos being taken in places where they shouldn&#8217;t be.  At least this way, eagle-eyed observers might have a better chance of knowing when someone is taking a photo.</p>
<p>IBM should have patented this. <a href="http://youtu.be/xuk5ED5szSA" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/xuk5ED5szSA</a></p>

<p>Et tu LTE?</p>
<p>Technically, it would be more correct to say &#8216;Et toi, LTE.&#8217; Sorry, I&#8217;m nitpicking.</p>

<p>Err&rsquo;one knows Err&rsquo;thing and No&rsquo;ing bout LTE</p>
<p>Does anyone at the Verge have a T-Mobile sim?  There is a huge difference between regular HSPA+ (AT&amp;T) and DC-HSPA+ (T-Mobile) , it&#8217;s not just twice as fast but triple. Within the last 10 months on T-Mobile, 20Mbps down is common with many cites getting up to 10 more than that. Not a massive gulf.</p>
<p>The new Google Nexus 4 LG can be claimed to be 4G, just not LTE.</p>
<p>Apparently, it would be more accurate to say it is 3.75G instead of 4G.</p>
<p>Details here: <a href="http://www.androidauthority.com/hspa-vs-lte-which-one-is-better-78120/" target="_blank">http://www.androidauthority.com/hspa-vs-lte-which-one-is-better-78120/</a></p>
<p>a 8.3 because it lacks LTE (call quality/reception is the score that took the beating), you have to wonder, how would this score in Europe, Asia and Latin America?</p>
<p>Im in Venezuela right now, highly considering this phone, for a country without LTE, this gets a solid 9 in my book, anyway, 8.3 is crazy good without LTE for the US Market.</p>
<p>Same here in Europe. I get quite consistent 10 mbps or more speeds on my Galaxy Nexus which to mee seems more than fine. Josh got half that on At&t so that might be another story. I still don&rsquo;t see how this could be a deal breaker though so I would agree with a 9 in non-LTE countries and 8.3 in the USA.</p>
<p>Yeah, you see? Josh did a great review, but one for the US Market.</p>
<p>Pana, unfortunately all the reviews are made like this. Not only for things like LTE. Consider NFC (Or lack of) in many countries (Venezuela included) it will be years before we can use it to pay or something like that, but their score takes that in account. We maybe don&rsquo;t care so you take what you can form a review, you know what you need from a phone, so the score is just a number that can make sense or not for you.<br />
If you take maps in consideration, Google maps and related services are awesome in the US and other &ldquo;first world&rdquo; countries but I Venezuela and other countries it&rsquo;s not that useful (In Valencia I find it really lacking for example). So the Verge would say it&rsquo;s the best mapping solution&hellip;for them and go and criticize Nokia Maps because it&rsquo;s not as good in the US, but It&rsquo;s actually better than Google maps in many other countries like Venezuela.<br />
I personally think it&rsquo;s even more troublesome when you think about the &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; score. Ecosystem is more than just apps, it&rsquo;s also about the services that you can consume on the phone, it&rsquo;s the availability of services (music, movies, others), payment in local currency, etc. For someone in the US Google&rsquo;s ecosystem is near perfect, outside, not so much. WP is knocked because it didn&rsquo;t have many apps that were associated with certain service like pandora or whatever, for somebody in many countries this is not an issue because we can&rsquo;t even use the services that is regionally locked.</p>

<p>^ This pana from Valencia made a lot of sense, you are QFT !!! (quoted for truth)</p>
<p>We would knock the Ecosystem for at least 3 points and raise Call Quality/Reception for at least 3 more points, in the end it would still be an amazing for for an incredible price within our reach.</p>
<p>Yes, for $350 it&rsquo;s an awesome deal.</p>
<p>an amazing phone for an incredible price*</p>

<blockquote>Consider NFC (Or lack of) in many countries (Venezuela included) it will be years before we can use it to pay or something like that, but their score takes that in account.</blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe the hype. NFC has very little traction in the US. It&#8217;s just a checkbox at this point.</p>
<p>You can use NFC for a LOT more than paying with your phone (which hasn&#8217;t really taken off in the US either).</p>
<p>NFC tags are inexpensive and you can program them with your phone and do some pretty amazing things with them.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great list of examples:<br />
<a href="http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57478334-285/the-most-practical-creative-ways-to-use-nfc-with-your-android-device/" target="_blank">http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57478334-285/the-most-practical-creative-ways-to-use-nfc-with-your-android-device/</a></p>
<p>Most of the uses listed in that article can be done better with Tasker or Settings Profiles.</p>
<p>You could pull most of them off, but I don&#8217;t know about &#8220;better&#8221;.<br />
One that you definitely couldn&#8217;t do without NFC is letting friends log into your wifi without having to give them the password.</p>
<p>To be able to do most of the others automatically would require MUCH finer GPS resolution than is available, and the app would have to keep GPS on all the time draining your battery.</p>
<p>Otherwise you&#8217;re stuck unlocking your phone and sifting through perhaps dozens of profiles instead of just tapping the NFC card.</p>
<p>Most people buy phones on 2 year contracts. In two years LTE should be considerably more widespread, at least in the UK where roll-out has just started. I&rsquo;m thinking of hanging on to my GNex for another year, and then upgrading this time next year, possibly to the next next Nexus.</p>
<p>Not sure how phone subsidies work in the UK but 300USD or 300Euro both are great prices for a phone without contract.</p>
<p>heres a thought if anyone can help me out. In the specs it says it runs on the 1800mhz frequency. Isnt that the frequency that EE are using and calling LTE 4G?, therefore doesnt this phone have a form of LTE?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so.<br />
Even if the radio picks up signals on the 1800Mhz band, it&#8217;s still not an LTE radio.  LTE is encoded/decoded differently and requires specific hardware to do that.</p>
<p>Yes and No. Yes EE are refarming their 1800 spectrum which they previously used for 2G for LTE but the phone will only operate at 2G &amp; 3G and doesn&#8217;t have LTE. The radios in the phone might work at 1800Mhz spectrum but that will be for 2G or 3G</p>
<p>The 16 Gig Nexus 4 is £280. That&#8217;s a great price, but considering I&#8217;m going to want an LTE phone in a year and it&#8217;s essentially just a moderate screen and camera improvement over the GNex, I still don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>I know this is several days late reply, but I can&#8217;t believe that people think that this is just a &#8216;slight&#8217; screen and camera upgrade to the Gnex.  The OMAP4 SoC in the Gnex vs the quad core Krait/Adreno 320 SoC in the Nexus 4 put them in completely differently leagues.</p>
<p>Sure, sure. But the thing is my Galaxy Nexus feels smooth and responsive. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s room for improvement, and I know the SoC in the Nexus 4 is a beast. But I don&#8217;t really feel like I need it. I just never find myself thinking &#8220;I wish this bloody thing was <em>faster</em>&#8221;. Maybe if it had some laggy skin on it I might feel differently.</p>
<p>The Nexus4 will be the first Nexus phone I haven&#8217;t bought* and that&#8217;s only because my Galaxy Nexus doesn&#8217;t feel slightly long in the tooth. I don&#8217;t use the camera on my phone very much (call me a weirdo but I don&#8217;t photograph every second of my life and I have a DSLR for special events), I don&#8217;t get peed off by unnoticeable pentile on a 720p screen and I haven&#8217;t found anything that particularly taxes the SoC in the GNex (although maybe that&#8217;s because I play most of the graphics-heavy Android games on my Nexus7 now?).</p>
<p>I replaced my Nexus One with the Nexus S mainly due to the low internal storage on the N1;  that upgrade possibly wasn&#8217;t necessary but the storage issue was really starting to annoy me by that time. Nexus S to GNex was a no-brainer really.</p>
<p>I think the N4 looks pretty damn tasty; everything appears to have taken at least a small step up which together would probably be a large jump &#8211; but I just don&#8217;t feel I need it. It&#8217;s not even that the lack of LTE bothers me; My network provider (3 UK) won&#8217;t have LTE for 6-12 months but I never find their speeds slow when browsing, which is the main thing I use my phone for when on the move. Plus for £239 (or £279 for 16GB) I could buy one and replace it when LTE is available&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;<em>but I don&#8217;t feel the need.</em></p>
<p>Maybe there will be a Nexus 5 vanilla android version of that HTC J Butterfly beautiful monster doing the rounds in Japan&#8230; might be tempted to get that in 6 months time if it were to end up having LTE and didn&#8217;t cost much more than the N4. I hope Google do sort out the &#8220;we can&#8217;t do LTE&#8221; issue soon though, for the sake of the Nexus line&#8230;</p>
<p>*Disclaimer: I&#8217;m almost definitely not going to buy it but I reserve the right to change my mind.</p>
<p>You can buy the 8GB for £239.00 in the Play store mate</p>
<p>Yo tambi&eacute;n soy de Venezuela y este definitivamente es mi pr&oacute;ximo celular, siendo el ultimo Nexus desbloqueado por solo $349 (la version de 16GB) es una locura, aunque no estoy seguro si cambiarme a Movistar o quedarme con Movilnet (por el Internet m&oacute;vil).</p>
<p>Saludos.</p>
<p>Cualquiera de las dos, si ya te acostumbraste a Movilnet entonces quedate en Movilnet, en algunos lugares de Venezuela, los datos son malos, en otros va bien la cosa.</p>
<p>Yo estoy en Maracaibo, aqui es terrible, por lo que uso Movistar, donde andas tu?</p>
<p>well obviously.</p>
<p>Yo vivo en Caracas, pero estuve viendo los planes de Movistar y los precios de los planes de datos son muy elevados para lo que ofrecen, en Movilnet esta casi a la mitad del costo.</p>
<p>Por cierto primera ves que leo a otro Venezolano, y en este post no solo uno si no dos, genial, The Verge is Awesome!!</p>
<p>Good point&hellip; And for me, it scored more like a 4.3, because even in my tiny market, I have Verizon LTE.  I would never buy a phone without it.</p>
<p>Scores are truly subjective and in the end, we have to score it based on OUR individual needs.</p>
<p>This phone is an epic fail for me, but for a non-LTE market, it may be the best phone out there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m honestly on VZW LTE (according to maps and my iphone settings) and it&rsquo;s honestly not fast at all.  I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.  My old prepaid sprint phone felt faster online.  I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;ve got the bugs worked out, yet.</p>
<p>Has anyone actually checked the speeds in the real world for each carrier?</p>
<p>Then get the Galaxy Nexus. And good luck waiting on the Jelly Bean 4.2 release!<br />
Verizon is a curse, you&#8217;ll get LTE but delayed updates.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Nexus, root it.</p>
<p>I really wanted to love this phone but for my use case it&#8217;s out after three strikes: <br />
1. LTE: I have a grandfathered unlimited 4g plan, it&#8217;s faster than my college&#8217;s wifi, it gets used for everything. I will never purchase a phone that doesn&#8217;t support it (until 5g/real 4g)<br />
2. Glass back: did you learn NOTHING from the iPhone glass debacle? Every one of my friends with iPhones has cracked their front and or back in a drop. <br />
3. Battery: I have 3 standard batteries and a 3800 mA/hr extended battery for my Gnex, I had a 3500 extended for my previous android phone. I need 12+ hours of use time between charges sometimes, give me the option google.</p>
<p>That said I think they missed a potential market for unlocked phones for Verizon customers; people like me who are on grandfathered plans can never use an upgrade again, I have to buy all phones at full retail. I&#8217;d jump right on top of an unlocked verizon phone at this price, if not for the above mentioned reasons&#8230;.</p>
<p>They missed the market because Verizon wont allow it. Have you ever seen a unlocked Verizon or Sprint phone? The answer is no because Verizon will not allow the phones on their network.</p>
<p>The iphone 5 is unlocked on Verizon.</p>
<p>Only when it relates to the GSM slot.  You still can&#8217;t take an iPhone activated on Verizon and run it on Sprint.</p>
<p>LTE is really good on VW, but unless you are on an unlimited plan I don&#8217;t think its a necessity.  I think most people use and or have access to wifi  so LTE while great isn&#8217;t a make or break for a lot of people.  It&#8217;s nice when wifi is not available, but HSPA isn&#8217;t 3G slow either.</p>
<p>The deal breaker for me is lack of expandable storage&#8230;ever since Google decided on eliminating MicroSD card slots on the Nexus phones, the told me to basically look elsewhere and deal with OEM skins. I&#8217;m part of that minority where the cloud is completely useless underground (NYC Subways), and having to manage playlists is work I don&#8217;t want to do&#8230;particularly since I like listening to a wide variety of music at the spur of  the moment.</p>
<p>So use a dedicated music device like an iPod or one of Sansa&#8217;s many cheap and expandable options.</p>
<p>And by Sansa I mean Sandisk</p>
<p>I think the reason Google has eliminated the MicroSD card slot on their Nexus devices is because Google has come to the comfortable final decision that the Nexus device(s) [from here on out] are their Flagship devices, but to the level of what Google started out as&#8212;a search  engine (correct?).  IF this truly is the case, then the reason for no MicroSD card slot, the reason for the max of 16Gb of storage&#8230;is for Nexus users to live in the Cloud&#8212;utilizing the Google services&#8212;with the music, photos, videos, documents, etc. stored there.  Therefore, leaving PLENTY of space forrrrrrr what else do most users need [aside from various ROMs]&#8230;?</p>
<p>you shouldnt be thinking&#8230;.</p>
<p>Google has already answered this many times now, and they havn&#8217;t included an SD card since the nexus one, so i have no idea why this is a shock to anyone</p>
<p>No microSD on Nexus One?</p>
<p>I use Play Music, it caches my songs so if I don&#8217;t have data for a while I&#8217;m fine. You could use a dedicate device, but I don&#8217;t understand the point of spending all that extra money.<br />
However, the reason for no SD (along with &#8220;live in the clouds&#8221;) is that it would raise the cost of the device. There is a $15 licensing fee to Microsoft, plus the cost of the actual hardware. So that looks like about a $20 bump in price.. I guess it&#8217;s a trade-off you have to make?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/why-nexus-devices-have-no-sd-card" target="_blank">http://www.androidcentral.com/why-nexus-devices-have-no-sd-card</a> This is why not having an SD card doesn&#8217;t bother me.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;d get a 9.2 score here in Brazil.<br />
&hellip;but LTE networks are starting to be deployed here, with commercial launch in major cities scheduled for next year.</p>
<p>PCMag did a recent and comprehensive mobile broadband test:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405596,00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405596,00.asp</a></p>
<p>30 cities.</p>
<p>Tmobile had an average speed of 6.84 Mbps across the 30 cities.<br />
Verizon LTE had an average speed of 8.89 Mbps across the 30 cities.</p>
<p>I get that Tmobile is no comparison to Verizon when it comes to coverage, but I think The Verge crew really needs to reassess the actual real world difference between LTE and HSPA+ for consumers who are in both good Verizon and Tmobile coverage. LTE is clearly the better technology, but I am not personally going to sell my soul to a carrier for 2 years on a contract and STILL pay $200 for a phone so that I can gain 2 Mbps down and have lower latency.</p>
<p>Combine the Nexus 4 with T-Mobiles $30 unlimited data plan or Straight Talk unlimited everything $45 and you have a winner.</p>
<p><img src="http://www5.pcmag.com/media/images/348453-fmn-chart-national-500.jpg?thumb=y" /></p>
<p>Can I get a link to this unlimited plan? I want to get this and I am trying to work out what plan to get.</p>
<p><a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/monthly-4g-plans" target="_blank">http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/monthly-4g-plans</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the Unlimited Web &amp; Text with 100 Minutes Talk plan.</p>
<p>Here is another option&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysimplemobile.com/plans-50-unlimited.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.mysimplemobile.com/plans-50-unlimited.aspx</a></p>
<p>I have the unlimited plan with my Value plan. It only costs $20/month when you bring your own phone. Spreading the cost on my family plan, I only pay $67/month for unlimited everything and my data is already up at 7 GB.</p>
<p>T-Mobile guarantees 9999 GB of data allowance. Get it before they change their minds lol.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d agree, but Im in an area heavily blanketed by AT&amp;T LTE.  I&#8217;ve seen as high as 59mbps down on both my iPad, and Galaxy S3.  That&#8217;s a compromise I&#8217;m not too quick to give up just for vanilla Android.</p>
<p>On my Galaxy S3 on T-Mobile I can regularly get 15 &#8211; 20Mbps. The Nexus 4 does have DC-HSPA and I feel like LTE isn&#8217;t that necessary in areas like mine where T-Mobile has 42Mbps HSPA. Sure, LTE may get you 10 more Mbps, but what for? Video and music streaming is already instant&#8230;</p>
<p>All the other sites are saying the battery life is pathetic, but the Verge says it&#8217;s great?</p>
<p>Also is the silver band around the sides metal or fake plastic chrome?</p>
<p>Unless there&#8217;s something draining the battery here, I have a hard time believing the battery life is too bad.  With juice defender on my S3, my battery lasts all day, and I consider myself a power user.  I&#8217;d imagine vanilla Android without a skin would have to be even better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also read on several sites about the terrible battery life. This is the first review that I&#8217;ve read that proclaims the opposite. And the Verge isn&#8217;t just saying it&#8217;s okay, they&#8217;re saying that it&#8217;s &#8220;top notch&#8221;.</p>
<p>Confused now&#8230;</p>
<p>Even in the US the &#8220;knock&#8221; on not having LTE is ridiculous, LTE still isn&#8217;t widespread in the US hell it isn&#8217;t even in every major city yet (I live in LA and rarely see LTE with verizon) and getting &#8216;only&#8217; 5Mbps with 3G is perfectly fine for a mobile device.</p>
<p>Of course the other con of the phone was that the reviewer dropped his phone and broke it; there is a simple fix for that, don&#8217;t drop your phone from 3+&#8217; onto hardwood and if you do don&#8217;t go looking for the manf. to replace it for you.</p>
<p>Thats exactly right. It isnt very wide spread. I travel domesticly ALOT. And honestly the speeds this phone will see on edge /2g is far more relevant to me then LTE. 90% of the time if im in an LTE market im on WiFi anyway.</p>
<p>When I was in L.A. last month on vacation, I had LTE pretty much everywhere with Verizon. Their coverage map is getting bigger and bigger, as the plan is to completely kill off CDMA and fall back on LTE only in the future, it will be widespread, and is pretty damn widespread now.</p>
<p>Verizon&#8217;s near term (late 2014) plan is 2.5mhz of 1x Advanced for legacy, and LTE everywhere else. Expect EVDO to start completely disappearing by the end of next year.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t understand the obsession with LTE.  90% of the time I use my phone I am able to use wifi, the only times I miss a little extra speed is when I need to check a fact or something whilst eating somewhere.</p>
<p>Then again I suppose if I were a passenger somewhere I might miss it but I can&rsquo;t really see that as being huge either; certainly not enough to completely ignore a product because of it&rsquo;s omission.</p>
<p>The fragile glass on the other hand&hellip; that would keep me away.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t seem to keep people away from iPhone 4S.  But thn it seemed to shatter, rather than produce tiny cracks.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether you live in the US, but I live in the UK. I use my phone for work, and since every train operator, station, airport, and come conference centres (!) insist on charging for WiFi (or not providing it at all) then mobile internet is a dealbreaker. Especially since my laptop doesn&#8217;t have a cellular radio, and more &amp; more cloud services are becoming the norm.</p>
<p>Although, EE can take a running jump with their data caps and pricing- think I&#8217;d rather wait until there&#8217;s some competition&#8230;</p>
<p>This is my <strike>Next</strike> Nexus.</p>

<p>LOL. CLASSIC Episode.  BEST. COMMENT. EVER.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>Modern recview are suck.</p>
<p>I need the information on how exacly this phone and Android improves my live compared to other platforms. what is the difference? Where to get this info? I found Smoked by Windows Phone is a great example of how various use case scenarios differs form each other on different platforms. Here i can only see authors opinions. Without facts.</p>
<p>Modern reviews suck.</p>
<p>Reading comprehension is fun!</p>
<p>So Microsoft setting up a handful of staged/predetermined comparisons is a great comparison, but a editorial review (which is by definition subjective) is a problem for you?</p>
<p>No double standards at all.</p>
<p>the problems is in Smoked by WP i see real examples of how many clicks i need to make things done. I really don&rsquo;t understand what is so special for Android. If i&rsquo;ll see where it is better with FACTS i&rsquo;ll buy Android. Where to get this info?</p>
<p>Go to Best Buy or a store that lets you play with the items hands on. That is a good way to get a feel for how you like a particular phone.</p>
<p>With the right setup, you can pretty much do anything you want with one touch (or less) in Android. Text my wife? A contact widget. A new calendar event? Pure calendar widget. A quick note? The Evernote widget. Directions and estimated driving time to the party tonight? No touches &ndash; Google now alerts me. Android can be anything you want it to be; you just need to put in the setup work.</p>
<p>Thank you. That is a real answer i have been waiting for.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re more specific as to the types of things you&#8217;d like to do on your device, the Verge readers would probably help you out. Perhaps a forum post in the Android army section asking how users like to do certain tasks. You could do the same for Windows Phone and compare that way, too.</p>
<p>for &ldquo;few clicks&rdquo; I&rsquo;d say android hands down. It&rsquo;s such a relief compared to the iPod touch I used before. The quick settings pane? I have that on top of my notification pane now with Power toggles. I can&rsquo;t imagine clicking through 4 menus to turn off wifi again! Same with play/pause widget in the homescreen, instead of awkward double tap, swipe nonsense in iOS.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used WP7, but from what I have seen it&rsquo;s pretty static and inflexible.</p>
<p>Microsoft allows tiles for certain settings (wifi, data, bluetooth, and airplane mode) and other shortcuts (quick email, text, status update, tweet) to be pinned to the home screen. Playback settings are on the lock screen while any music app is active (if a song is playing or paused); they are also accessible anywhere by toggling one of the volume keys.</p>

<p>WP isn&rsquo;t as efficient as Android in this regard, but it&rsquo;s certainly more efficient than (non-jailbroken) iOS.</p>
<p>Is there any way to limit the size of attached pictures on here, or is it up to me to resize before linking them?</p>
<p>ok. that&rsquo;s pretty cool. And looks way better than iOS :)</p>
<p>You know i don&#8217;t know if you know this or not but you can easily go out and get on off toggles on android on the play market for free so pretty much anything you could do with a shortcut on WP you can do on android with a tiny bit of looking&#8230;. That said the music controls previously at least on my gingerbread device were abysmal if the screen was locked there was nothing actually there however Google is adding in lock screen widgets and all now so should see some mass improvements that don&#8217;t make them much different by any means other than their visual look and &#8220;feel&#8221;</p>
<p>I do know you can do this all on Android, and that&#8217;s why I said it is more efficient than WP. I&#8217;m running CyanogenMod 10 on my Optimus V, and it&#8217;s quite slick for a 2 year old bottom-end phone. I&#8217;ve had notification tray settings since CM7 (CM6 on my G1, even) Since ICS (or maybe this is just in CM9), music controls similar to WP  have been on the lock screen and in the notification tray.</p>
<p>Random question:</p>
<p>I can see the appeal of these quick access toggles in theory&#8230; especially if your phone is a battery hog (Android appears to have outgrown that now, though). But&#8230; why are you turning off wifi or bluetooth or whatever? I&#8217;ve literally never had cause to turn it off on my iPhone. I just tell it not to constantly ask to join networks that I haven&#8217;t told it about, and all is well. The toggles I actually use (screen rotation lock, vibrate) are easily accessible. I don&#8217;t mean this snarkily at all&#8230; just curious.</p>
<p>I do agree, though&#8230; I&#8217;d like it if you could stick the play/pause controls in the notification centre instead of the multitasking menu.</p>
<p>I turn off Bluetooth to my Lumia 900 so I can connect my Surface. using these headphones of course.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jaybirdgear.com/freedom-bluetooth-headphones/" target="_blank">http://www.jaybirdgear.com/freedom-bluetooth-headphones/</a></p>
<p>Bluetooth support in my car is kinda wonky. Works just fine with calls but doesn&#8217;t play well with speech commands (searches, sending/receiving texts, turn-by-turn navigation). Usually I leave BT on for calls, but if I&#8217;m driving and I need to find the nearest whatever, I&#8217;ll flip off the BT, do a voice search, tap on map results and have it read me directions.</p>
<p>My HD7 is a battery hog, and the capacity is puny (1250 mAh) :(</p>
<blockquote>I really don&rsquo;t understand what is so special for Android. If i&rsquo;ll see where it is better with FACTS i&rsquo;ll buy Android. Where to get this info?</blockquote>  <p>How the hell is one person supposed to cater a review to how a device, an unnecessary gadget, can improve <em>your</em> particular life?</p>
<p>God forbid you leave the house and GO DEMO the thing!  Spread your wings, learn to fly&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not talk to him anymore.</p>
<p>If clicks are that important, you&rsquo;re free to try friends&rsquo; phones and go to carrier stores.  They do have live phones, you know.</p>
<p>That way you can try Instagram and SpellTower on each platform &hellip; ha.</p>
<p>Maybe click efficiency aren&rsquo;t the best metric for everyone, just like horsepower isn&rsquo;t the be-all end-all of car reviews.</p>
<p>So you would prefer to make your purchasing opinions based on slick marketing tactics?</p>
<p>I think you might be a little lost&hellip;<a href="http://www.engadget.com"></a></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re so transparent it hurts.  We get it, you love WP and will knock every other platform given any opportunity.</p>
<p>Some sites will have comparisons between phones on various items and that might give you some Idea of how they compare. just google it. or bing it or whatever search you use.</p>
<p>I guess the astroturfers are still among us.</p>
<p>Ok so the smoked by Windows phone thing was a pretty stacked test using widgets setup specifically for the testing purposes. You CAN set up android similarly and even better if you do some research into it. One guy beat the smoked by windows phone test if you recall this because he had weather displayed on his lock screen which shows when the phone first comes up so he got the info faster than Windows Phone did it.</p>
<p>Android can pretty much meet any usage scenario issues depending how the user sets it up. You can do everything from easier to use launchers different widget downloads and displays some quick gestures and settings etc. Some people do not like putting in the work to get this going or don&#8217;t &#8220;want or need&#8221; that info or quick launch stuff displayed right there and thus tend to prefer simpler stuff that just has nothing there at all on the widget front like iOS does it and others will go to Windows Phone which while it has some widgets is not as extendable in some regards as android though some people find it easier to use.</p>
<p>Android out of the three major players currently in the mobile OS arena would be considered the most customizable, extendable,  and powerful. It had earlier problems due to some hardware optimizations like not having the entire OS gpu accelerated etc and some stability issues. It still has some issues with apps dues to developers not heeding googles design advice for the devices built around android and all. It is getting better and better and the nexus devices have far less problems (while lacking storage expansion or LTE&#8230;) due to not being skinned and having so so software hooked in through the back end to keep it locked down&#8230;</p>
<p>This all I was thinking while watching and reading the review. Brilliant.</p>
<p>best comment ever x 2</p>
<p>I totally forgot about that episode. Epic win is epic.</p>
<p>Returning my Surface so I can buy a Lumia 900 + this!</p>
<p>and why would you need both?</p>
<p>Better to have two functional phones than one dysfunctional tablet.</p>
<p>I kid&hellip;</p>
<p>haha, don&rsquo;t quit your day job.</p>
<p>920? Was that a typo?</p>
<p>Greatest deal in the history of phones.</p>
<blockquote>Greatest deal in the history of phones.</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. This is absolutely the best regular price I&rsquo;ve ever seen in smartphones.</p>
<p>However I get the itching feeling that Google had to compromise the LTE and the screen because of the cost issue. They could&rsquo;ve easily made a few different models for LTE if required and put a better performing display on it (although it could just be a software issue)</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the review take the price into account? In fact price should be one of the parameters in reviewing any device.</p>
<p>None of the Verge staff have kids or are taking care of aging parents. That tells you why they never talk about price. The tech press is a homogeneous group that doesn&rsquo;t always understand the average person. They are basically guessing at what people like.</p>
<blockquote>Why doesn&rsquo;t the review take the price into account? </blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the price is taken account into the review. Otherwise the lack of LTE at the end of 2012 would&rsquo;ve take more points off it.</p>
<p>Also the USA factor might be working here. In the USA there&rsquo;s not much incentive to not to go on a contract if you want a fast LTE connection. If you&rsquo;re buying a phone on a contract, the price difference between Nexus 4 and other top phones isn&rsquo;t as big.</p>
<p>I think at the end of 2013, the lack of LTE should be a critic point as that is when LTE will probably be fully up and running all over the world.</p>
<p>All over the world? Try 2015. Most of the developing world is still entering the 3G era.</p>
<p>developing world has already entered 3G era infact some countries like India already have LTE.</p>
<p>Because India is, obviously, the entirety of the developing world.</p>
<p>When you take out the so-called developed world, India and China, what do you have left? You no longer have a big enough market for a high end phone.</p>
<p>you mean like how it scored a 6 on call quality/data?</p>
<p>They lumped data connection and call quality together, which is why LTE brought it down. If you read the article it actually says call quality is great.</p>
<p>But Y GLASS?</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wKZrF.jpg" /></p>
<p>Y U No have LTE?</p>
<p>#FTFY</p>
<p>For $300 unlocked.. I am fine with 21Mbps HSPA. <br />
Heck, I will buy 2 of then and combine them into a 42Mbps Super Phone,&hellip; you watch,, I will do it.</p>
<p>MIMO FTW?</p>
<p>Actually the Nexus 4 will have support for DCHSDPA+ which is 42Mbps. Some areas of the UK already have this and it&rsquo;s not that much slower than the new LTE from EE.</p>
<p>Which networks already have DCHSDPA+?</p>
<p>o2, Vodafone, Three & T-Mobile, although coverage maps are hard to come by</p>
<p>three has one on their site. Just google DCHSDPA+ uk and go to the three link</p>
<p>giving call quality a 6/10 and saying he only had 1 dropped call and that everything else was excellent is pure bullshit. everything else is good.</p>
<p>That technology really needed a few more letters to its acronym.<br />
Catchy!</p>
<p>LOL exactly. It&#8217;s getting ridiculously long.</p>
<p>DCHSDPA+. What a nice snappy name.</p>
<p><em>duh-chus-duh-pah</em></p>
<p>plus. </p>
<p>It has 42mbps hspa,. actually</p>
<p>It is actually capable of 42Mbps! I would have really liked it if they tested it on T-mobile since they are the ones carrying it and I have the galaxy Nexus on T-mobile which is only capable of 21Mbps so I would have really loved to see the difference on T-mobile :(</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t know why they would test it on ATT HSPA+21 when T-Mobile has the faster HSPA+42&#8230;</p>
<p>but I am not fine with 8GB storage, what, is this 2007?</p>
<p>so spend an extra $50 and get the 16G version.</p>
<p>Just buy one and put it on tmobile where they combine two of the spectrums and make it a 42mbps HSPA+ phone in it&rsquo;s current state.</p>
<p>The fact is you wont get 21mb&#8217;s. most people, like 80-90 % get 3-5.</p>
<p><img src="http://http://www.speedtest.net/android/282482870.png" /></p>
<p>i get 25mb on t-mobile 42mbps around my house and around 15mb on average on my S3, My girlfriends S3 lte from verizon is a bit better in some places and worse in others. i pay 30 and she pays ALOT so im happy with Tmobile. i live in California.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 gets LTE and ditches the rear glass&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; Nexus 4 gets glass on the back and no LTE.</p>
<p>OOooo&hellip; the ironing</p>
<p>Me thinks you meant the &ldquo;irony&rdquo;..? \o/</p>
<p>No, I think he/she was just stuck at home ironing instead of at the store buying this phone.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.core77.com/corehome/ironman_ironing_web.jpg" /></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it funny how ironing boards have wrinkles on them.</p>
<p>Wait&#8230;that is an irony!</p>
<p>Wait&#8230;&#8220;irony&#8221; has &#8220;iron&#8221; in it!</p>
<p>I may be high.</p>
<p>Put &rsquo;em on the glass &hellip;</p>
<p>BCUZ OF iPHONE.</p>
<p>Why do people bitch about LTE? The battery technology isn&rsquo;t on the same level as the radio chip sets, LTE will drain a lot of juice. Google is smart. I think they&rsquo;ll wait it off till the battery technology catches up, so you can get 12hr talk/game time while on LTE. Pretty sure if Google had LTE on this device, a lot of people who were crying for it will still be crying, this time&hellip; it&rsquo;ll be over battery drains.</p>
<p>battery not on same level? Tell that to the iPhone 5 users&hellip;</p>
<p>$300 vs. $650</p>
<p>using voice and data simultaneously (N4) versus one or the other (iPhone 5)</p>
<p>Only on Verizon</p>
<p>Verizon FAIL.</p>
<p>The problem is that (for the vast majority of users) LTE is basically a Verizon thing. There are a bunch of LTE users, but the largest percentage are on Verizon, which is why this doesn&rsquo;t have LTE.</p>
<p>Still could have given it AT&T LTE, and whatever is being used on LTE GSM carriers in Europe.</p>
<p>Google is basically very pissed with Verizon.</p>
<p>As they should be. As everyone should be that has a Nexus through them.</p>
<p>Since Google is now Motorola, how will this impact the Droid business?</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t because Google and Motorola are basically different companies due to Chinese regulations on them.</p>
<p>The only real implication of the merger was that Google gets to collect the &#8220;profits&#8221; (lol&#8230;) and the patent portfolio.</p>
<p>Only 2 carriers in the US have a significant LTE footprint. And I hate them both.</p>
<p>Only one carrier world wide has a significant footprint. So I don&#8217;t see how two can in the US.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perfectly clear that Google isn&#8217;t bothering with LTE because LTE and Verizon go hand in hand. Like it or hate it, that&#8217;s their reasoning.</p>
<p>I think Verizon wouldn&#8217;t be an issue if they allowed Google to sell a truly pure Android device.</p>
<p>Wow, funny seeing so many people decide that LTE isn&#8217;t as important as it was when the iPhone 4S DIDN&#8217;T have it.</p>
<p>and Sprint</p>
<p>I can use voice and data together just fine on my iPhone 5. Only the CDMA versions can&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<p>Spy vs. Spy</p>
<p>Sorry, but the iPhone 5 does not have the greatest battery life, it&rsquo;s acceptable but in no way class leading.  It&rsquo;s not even better than the 4S, despite a bigger battery.  I haven&rsquo;t used an N4, but I would guess it&rsquo;s superior, and there is no question phones like the Razr Maxx make the iPhone 5 look laughably short lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the most amazing feats Apple pulled off in the thinner, lighter iPhone 5 is that the battery life is not only as good as the previous phone&hellip; it&rsquo;s actually better. Even when using LTE data!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Verge&rsquo;s iPhone 5 Review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of users complain about the 5&rsquo;s battery life. Maybe they&rsquo;re in poor LTE areas, but I live in a strong Verizon LTE area and friends of mine with the 5 are unimpressed with its battery performance compared to the 4S.</p>
<p>Not to sound difficult but I have a few co-workers that say the opposite, plus the review&hellip; I&rsquo;m more inclined to believe there may be something up with your area&rsquo;s coverage or their general usage that may not be the norm.</p>
<p>Talk time on the iPhone 5 is less than the 4S, period. Check anandtech.com.  Surfing the same content, the battery will last longer because LTE gets it quick and sleeps.  If you end up using the extra capability to load more content over the same period, you will also have lower battery life  with the iPhone 5. It&#8217;s quite simple.</p>
<p>Many people use data on their phone much much less than they talk. It would make sense  that if the battery life for data is better but talking is worse, my overall battery life is better because 98% of my time is spent on data. YMMV.</p>
<p>A big factor in battery life is the average signal strength of the device. If their LTE has a poor connection compared to the HSPA of the 4S then the batt. life will be pretty poor. From the tests I&rsquo;ve seen the battery life is pretty outstanding for such a small battery.</p>
<p>My personal experience going from 4S to 5 is that the 5&rsquo;s battery life is noticeably better. It is about the same as the 4. My coworkers agree with me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I trust The Verge over your comment.</p>
<p>The Verge&rsquo;s review is biased.  Every review out there shows the 5 has less battery life than the 4S.  Apples ratings for the 5 are very generous.  The iPhone 4 still has the best battery life of any iPhone.</p>
<p>If the Verge&rsquo;s reviews are biased, why are you here? It&rsquo;s easy to say something/one is biased when you don&rsquo;t agree with them. I don&rsquo;t know these other reviews you speak of, all I&rsquo;m commenting on is a few co-workers who upgraded from the 4s to the 5 and extremely pleased with the battery life. you can take my opinion with a grain of salt but it&rsquo;s hard to buy your argument when the crux of it is bashing the review of the site you are on. if the don&rsquo;t review well why are you here?</p>
<p>For the record I really like this Nexus, if fact it&rsquo;s the first one that&rsquo;s made me take notice. It looks well designed and the software looks great.</p>
<p>>The Verge&rsquo;s review is biased.</p>
<p>Oh shut up.</p>
<p>How cannot be biased if that its the product that they use in their every day life. I don&rsquo;t have an apple tv so the air play for me is pointless. I use windows and Linux, don&rsquo;t use itunes and the app store is for me a pile of rubbish. LTE covarage here is horrid and I have to change from CDMA 3G to LTE all the time draining my battery. This seems like my next phone and I will drop Verizon for good.</p>
<p>no, the peeps at the Verge have EVERYTHING available to test in their offices, it&rsquo;s not a matter of one reviewer who has everything in one brand. The are constantly testing devices from different brands in different usages and comparing them. we need them to do that cause if not, what&rsquo;s the point? I know I&rsquo;m an apple guy, I wanna hear about stuff I am not familiar with. thats the reason this site exists. You thing they only have an Apple TV? they have Qs, anlong with all manner of Android devices and accessories. They gave this Phone a good review, they just dinged it for lack of LTE (big in NY). This &ldquo;biased&rdquo; stuff is crap. Be adults and realize people have opinions. you don&rsquo;t like them, got to a site that you agree with.</p>
<p>Untrue</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/13" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/13</a></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t make me embed all the charts!</p>
<p>The comments in which he states:  &ldquo;f we take a step back and look at the collection of results from our battery life tests, the iPhone 5 can last anywhere between 3.15 and 10.27 hours on a single charge. Do a lot of continuous data transfers and you&rsquo;ll see closer to 5 hours, but if you&rsquo;ve got reasonably periodic idle time you can expect something in the 8 &ndash; 10 hour range. In short, if you use your device a lot, don&rsquo;t be too surprised to see it lose about 10 &ndash; 15% of its battery life for every hour of use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is exactly what I get out of my Gnex running LTE all day.  There is absolutely nothing special about the iphone 5&rsquo;s battery life.  In actual usage, it has not done anything more spectacular with LTE than any other LTE phone, except Razar Maxx, which of course has that 3300 mAH battery.</p>
<p>Erm &ndash; no, for browsing it simply slaughters the Nexus, if you&rsquo;re getting 8-10 hours on your nexus, then your use profile would get you 20+ hours on an iPhone-5.</p>
<p>You also missed the most significant pull-quote:</p>
<p><em>&lsquo;Compared to previous iPhones, the 5 has the ability to use a lot more power. If you&rsquo;re doing the exact same, finite length CPU/network intensive task on the iPhone 5 and any previous iPhone, chances are that the iPhone 5 will be able to complete the task and get to sleep quicker &ndash; <strong>thus giving you a better overall energy usage profile.</strong> &rsquo;</em></p>
<p>The point of the paragraph was data transfers, not just browsing, which has to do with browsing, apps,, etc.  On my phone I predominately use tapatalk, and the bible app. I visit a website only when I have to using chrome to phone google add on when its something I can&#8217;t view from work,.  I also spend quite a bit of time using my bible app, with widgets and what not running in the background.    That paragraph would be true if you have the exact same LTE signal strength as one of the preivous iphone&#8217;s 3G signal strength.  All I am saying is its not that spectacular.  My onscreen time is usually between 2- 2 1/2 hours of on screen time throughout the day.  I use to get 3 hours of screen time on average with 12 hours of battery life, but that hasn&#8217;t been the case since switching to Jelly Bean.  I highly doubt the  iPhone would get 20+ hours of battery time out of my usage.</p>
<p>My primary usage of my iPhone-4 is the kindle app, I get at least 3 hours usage a day from that,  I charge my phone roughly every other day, so yes &#8211; 20 hours + seems quite reasonable according to your usage.</p>
<p>For example, right now the device is showing 3.5 hours usage, 10 hourss standby, and is at 74% battery.  It will easily last till tomorrow night without a recharge.</p>
<p>The iPhone isn&#8217;t exceptional when it comes to voice-call time, but for everything else, it is.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6425/google-nexus-4-and-nexus-10-review/2" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6425/google-nexus-4-and-nexus-10-review/2</a></p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s a trade-off.  But it&rsquo;s a trade-off that a lot of people are more than happy to make.  I can understand that there&rsquo;s a lot to like about this phone.  And I can understand that there are a lot of people who will be more than happy to overlook its flaws and pick one up.</p>
<p>But there are a ton of people in this thread who act like the lack of LTE support isn&rsquo;t even an issue at all, which is just ridiculous.  It&rsquo;s a <em>major</em> issue for a <em>lot</em> of customers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny, now you sound like the classic apple apologist that says &#8216;&#8217;we don&#8217;t need that thing, it isn&#8217;t ready&quot; only to be ranting and raving about it when you get it a year later. <br />
With all the phone that have LTE right now, which get better battery life than their predecessors w/out it, your argument falls apart. (iphone 5 vs 4s is the perfect example)</p>
<p>BS. I have a lumia 900 and I don&#8217;t notice any battery drain from LTE. My Titan 1 with hspa+.</p>
<p>We need more boost!!!</p>
<p>But seriously, there are parts in the US where T-Mobile is faster than Verizon. It all depends on where you are.</p>

<p>Camera 8? In video image looks really bad. Again weird scores.</p>
<p>Nokia Lumia 920 pureview camera also got an 8. Funny ain&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Also, call quality/reception got dinged for the LTE issue even though he specifically said the call quality and reception are actually very good. Does lack of LTE really fit into that category?</p>
<p>Not really. They should have a &ldquo;Features&rdquo; score. And a &ldquo;Bang for the Buck&rdquo; score.</p>
<p>Yea, the bang is when your phones back shatters after dropping it once. there&#8217;s a reason its so cheap. Glass and plastic are cheaper than aluminum and magnesium.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to speak to you last year.</p>
<p>High quality glass (like Corning GG2) is actually more expensive than aluminium, both material cost and the processing cost, as it&#8217;s harder to machine.</p>
<p>i checked engadget, they have nexus4 vs s3 shots, and this camera is a lto worse than s3, so how can it be 8, i can&rsquo;t imagine.</p>
<p>But they are reporting very good display, joshua said its washed&hellip;</p>
<p>how can this score 8 in camera? HOW???<br />

<p>sry, i am so bad with this posting picture thing here<br />
<img src="http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/8491/nexus4s3.jpg" /></p>
<p>Success!!!</p>
<p>So which one is which? The one on the right looks better, IMO.</p>
<p>sry, left one is nexus and right is s3</p>
<p>The left one has a strange orange tint on it. Probably a software issue that can be rectified with an update.</p>
<p>The Verge have officially lost all of its credibility as a Review site by giving this phone a 8.3 then rating higher or on par in many areas that the Nokia Lumia 920 has. I guess anyone could get a 8 for camera or even get an 8 for design when the glass back breaks off so easily. The rating system on the Verge is just RIDICULOUS,, I am sorry but this site needs to get some competent Reviewers on here and not fanboys or people who are scared to get their check..</p>
<p>Good luck at your new website</p>
<p>Yes. That phone is huge as well.</p>
<p>Oh, what will the Verge ever do without your world renown approval?&#8230;.</p>
<p>The reviewers are flipping legends, and so are their reviews.</p>
<p>The scoring is like wut</p>
<p>I really want this phone, but I cannot get it on my Verizon. That sucks. It makes it not worth it. I can&rsquo;t wait to see the new Nexus next year, hopefully, with 5g (or whatever is next) and some other nice improvements. This is one powerful phone, but without LTE, i feel it has disappointed a lot of people.</p>
<p>Did anyone, absolutely anyone, take notice that this is the 4th Nexus device?</p>
<p>Mmm? Oh, why yes, I just blew your mind.</p>
<p>If you can come to terms with slightly slower, but still decent network speeds, then this will be an amazing phone. I think I can as well as most people that actually take the time to assess their network speed needs. It&#8217;s a fantastic phone. Must have for most users.</p>
<p>350 + 199 =549€ for 16gb nexus phone/tab what a wonderful world we&#8217;re getting in&#8230; <br />
Thanks Google :-)</p>
<p>Software a 10 but comes with a FBI warning not to use.  Camera a 8 but lacks pureview quality in low light and stabilization.   Ecosystem an 8 which Kaspersky says up to 45% of apps have malware.</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>If only they would make the phone greyer and the screen would be invisible when the screen is off!</p>
<p>Yum</p>
<p>well&hellip;looks like this will be my 6th smartphone purchase this year. time to flip something on ebay</p>
<p>this is my &ldquo;next&rdquo; (again)</p>
<p>Six smartphone puchases in a year?  That&rsquo;s gangsta.  You should start hanging them on fat gold chains and wearing them around your neck like Flava Flav.</p>
<p>Which ones have you been using and what has been your favorite? After using the latest Apple, HTC and Samsung flagships I&rsquo;ve been tending to dislike Samsung&rsquo;s build quality a lot.</p>
<p>1) Started with a Galaxy Note (still have it and like it best as just a monster screen &#8211; go away on a weekend and I have a good camera, a good phone and a good small tablet)</p>
<p>2) Sony Xperia Ray to throw in my snowboard jacket. Also good camera and 854&#215;480 on a 3.2&quot; or 3.3&quot; display with ICS (still have this too)</p>
<p>3) Bought a Galaxy Nexus in April and sent it back due to a creaky battery cover(and the camera is terrible). Bought another in September and used in on a 3-week trip through the States (Pentaband FTW) and using it as a main phone, along with Note, now in Germany.</p>
<p>4) Bought a One X in June with every intention of keeping it but I got one with defective WLAN and was within 30 days and sent back to amazon. The back felt a bit hollow to me, and, well, Sense is terrible. The screen was nice, but on a website, I can still read more with my Note, even with Pentile and ok, it&#8217;s 5.3&quot;</p>
<p>5) Bought the Galaxy S3 but didn&#8217;t like the battery cover for the money, so went back to the Galaxy Nexus for 300€. and was considering the Galaxy Note 2</p>
<p>So which do I like the best? Galaxy Note, but the Note 2 would be even better.</p>
<p>At 299, the Nexus 4 is a no brainer. I think it can do what all of those do combined: big screen, better camera, stock Android and solves my biggest complaint with the Galaxy Nexus besides the camera: soft touch on the sides for a decent grip &#8211; should be mandatory on every phone.</p>
<p>yeah i hear the economy is bad.</p>
<p>6th in a year.  You sir have a problem.</p>
<p>Interesting Score.</p>
<p>BTW, This Is My Next</p>
<p>So yeah, this has a better display than the Galaxy Nexus, which uses crappy PenTile matrix, yet it has an 8 on the scores table, whereas G Nex got 9. It&rsquo;s just&hellip; nevermind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a year since the Galaxy Nexus review. Standards change.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t the N4 using same screen as in the Optimus G, which you gave a 9?</p>
<p>Really?!</p>
<p>I do think the score is a bit low overall. The review read like a 8.9-9.2 device. I know I&rsquo;m buying this off contract to go along with my iPhone 5.. Maybe it&rsquo;ll cull my &ldquo;Apple fanboy&rdquo; status to some Verge commenters. I do hate the camera placements, though.</p>
<p>I would encourage you to try it. I know you like your iOS, but pure Android  is something different</p>
<p>I owned a Galaxy Nexus before I got my iPhone 5. I&#8217;m aware. :]</p>
<p>Josh pointed out that the images looked a bit washed out, maybe thats the reason for the downgrade</p>
<p>This may be due to a Tegra 3 &ldquo;feature&rdquo; to save battery by lowering the brightness. The Nexus 7 has it, gets locked in and when the brightness goes back up, it looks like crap. Not sure if they fixed it in 4.1.2 or not, been running a different kernel with the feature disabled since launch</p>
<p>The nexus 4 doesn&rsquo;t have the Tegra 3 though.</p>
<p>I need this kernel.</p>
<p>Anand has the Nexus 4 display at the absolute tip-top in contrast and black levels.  Hmm.</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>But this is a flagship phone with higher expectations.  (I&rsquo;m still going to get it)</p>
<p>Not to mention the camera has the same score as the Nokia Lumia 920.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t he using a pre-production model though?  I suppose the retail version will be just fine.</p>
<p>You just dusted his argument.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to agree, giving it an 8 is a little silly.  Considering the Optimus G and iPhone5&rsquo;s 9s.</p>
<p>just because you&rsquo;re a Nole, i cant agree with you &ndash; see you in the ACC championship game (if my Canes can hold up until then&hellip;)</p>
<p>I just hope we beat Florida, I&rsquo;m tired of the media love affair with the SEC.  We got a two loss team ranked ahead of FSU.  It&rsquo;s getting ridiculous.</p>
<p>Hey hey now, that&rsquo;ll never happen.  Can&rsquo;t let you guys win two years in a row.</p>
<p>True. Gonna be a good game&hellip; I look forward to it.</p>
<p>The SEC is the best. Nuff said.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 is a better phone, so the score seems fair.</p>
<p>Yeah, bot it&rsquo;s three times the price</p>
<p>I want to edit this comment!!!!!</p>
<p>u r good at maths?</p>
<p>I was talking about the display rating.</p>
<p>I think the GNex was the first (second?) smartphone with a 720p display. It was ahead of the curve, despite the pentile subpixel arrangement. That was a year ago. This is a year hence. We&rsquo;ve time-travelled, yes? We&rsquo;re in a weird and wonderful world where everything is different. Maybe, outside, the polar ice caps have melted, maybe there&rsquo;s robots knocking about and Davina McCall&rsquo;s the new pope. Maybe you can download rice.</p>
<p>RIP The Thick of It</p>
<p>I enjoyed that.</p>
<p><strong>looks around nervously</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna get lynched here, but I think part of the problem was that the Galaxy Nexus score for its display was over generous.  It was a big deal in terms of specs, but it simply wasn&rsquo;t very good in terms of real image quality.  Josh fell in love with the GN and his score in a few places seemed &hellip; exuberant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got some rope right here. The reality is that the Galaxy Nexus has a very beautiful screen. Compared with newer phones like HTC one X it&rsquo;s not the best, but it is crisp and beautiful with really nice blacks and colours. This coming from someone who uses it every day of my life.</p>
<p>Really nice blacks, really terrible brightness, frequently grainy and invariably oversaturated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a very beautiful screen, unless you&rsquo;ve never used a better one.</p>
<p>and also everyday of my non-life. Zombie techie? Could be&hellip;.could be.</p>
<p>Maybe that explains why you&#8217;re not so bothered by the white levels as the black levels :)</p>
<p>Right, but I&rsquo;m also talking about the more recent Optimus G and iPhone5 scores on display.  If this is scored to some kind of new modern standard, those phones should be as well.  They are very recent models.  I&rsquo;m looking for some consistency here, and I can&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/15" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/15</a><br />

<p>If anything the iPhone deserved a 10 in display</p>
<p>Uhh okay.  Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have mentioned the iPhone5 since I keep getting defensive replies.  Read everything I said again.  It&#8217;s about display of this phone compared to Optimus G and iPhone5 on this site.  Not what Anandtech thinks about the display before OptimusG or N4 existed.  And it&#8217;s not what displaymate thinks of i5 vs the S3.  Those links would have mattered if it mentioned the Optimus G or N4 anywhere in their &#8220;research&#8221;.  They don&#8217;t, they only told me that you apparently like to have sex with your phone because you act like I called your wife a whore.</p>
<p>Hilarious!!! Best comment in this thread!!!</p>
<p>Siri IS kind of a bitch&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s about display of this phone compared to Optimus G and iPhone5 on this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>oh, then your problem is simple reading comprehension?  Because Josh says quite clearly &#8230;</p>
<p><em>The slightly wider screen did a great job with just about anything I threw at it, though I did still feel that it auto-dimmed too low in darker settings. <strong>The display also seems to produce more washed out looking colors than competing LCD screens like the iPhone 5 or One X.</strong> </em></p>
<p>Now since the in depth technical analysis of the iPhone-5 demonstrated it has near perfect colour reproduction, more washed out than the iPhone-5 would mean that the colour reproduction on the N4 is worse.</p>
<p>Do I need to use smaller words?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t get it. The <strong>exact same screen</strong> on the Nexus 4 got a <strong>higher score</strong>when it was used on the Optimus G.</p>
<p>And you have the gall to talk about &#8220;reading comprehension&#8221;?</p>
<p>I was wondering why the same screen is reportedly so different.  It might be a calibration or colour profile issue.</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>I can see why other review sites did away with scoring, because it seems to be hard to stay consistent.</p>
<p>Or maybe there are just a lot of favoritism.</p>
<p>Or maybe because readers take them too personally and complain about bias when their favorite brand gets an unfavorable score, even when they themselves haven&rsquo;t even tested the product.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if they removed the scores just so people have one less thing to argue about in the comments.</p>
<p>Those same people would just bitch about scores being removed.</p>
<p>I think your right, in a 1-10 score with multiple choices things can get a bit let&rsquo;s say mixed, and that&rsquo;s why they have a bigger sampling in true consumer suverys.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get why so many people care about a stupid number. Yet people complain about it  in every. single. review.</p>
<p>im sorry to say but scores do not transcend time and technology</p>
<p>Eh the galaxy nexus screen is still beautiful. I feel like I&#8217;m going to be the only one to defend it, but the contrast levels look surreal and the oversaturation generally gets better over time because of the pixels fading a bit.</p>
<p>On the vergecast they were talking about how there&#8217;s not much wow factor in the retina mbp displays, and I reckon its because they&#8217;re LCDs &#8211; they can&#8217;t stop blacks looking like they&#8217;re trying to block the backlighting, that the contrast is still low. In addition LCDs have never been known for accurate colour reproduction until someone started saying that quite recently. Amoleds feel more like a future technology that hasn&#8217;t matured yet, whereas the disadvantages of LCDs are well-known by now and have largely been accepted.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just my 2 cents. I don&#8217;t think many will agree with me judging by the general consensus on the verge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition LCDs have never been known for accurate colour reproduction until someone started saying that quite recently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erm, you&#8217;re conflating the desktop where LCDs took a long time to catch up with the better CRTs for professional levels of colour reproduction and mobile where LCDs are the more mature tech and have invariably had better colour reproduction than AMOLED.</p>
<p>LCD phones have had good colour accuracy for several years at least.</p>
<p>Its not only about the screen, he said that he really needs LTE, so for him it is worse, also the G Nexus is older.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 or Nexus 4, that a problem</p>
<p>That really shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem.</p>
<p>But it is. A stale OS with LTE, or a drastically innovative OS without LTE? Both are equally compelling. There&rsquo;s obviously more to the situation than those two features, but that&rsquo;s basically what it comes down to.</p>
<p>Stale OS with all those exclusive apps you can only get on iOS. How boring!</p>
<p>2008 says hai, and wants ist stale argument back.</p>
<p>You mean both arguments right?</p>
<p>The iOS is stale vs Android is actually relatively new&hellip; because only recently has Android been better than iOS.</p>
<p>iOS being stale isn&rsquo;t new at all, however UI on Android being better is about a year old at this point.  In my opinion it&rsquo;s impossible to argue that OS  and first party software on Android is better than iOS.  On the other hand it&rsquo;s  equally impossible to argue 3rd party software isn&rsquo;t better on iOS.  I prefer Android because the OS and 1st party software is vastly better and the 3rd party has everything that I need.  But to each their own.</p>
<p>Sorry that was supposed to read  &lsquo;impossible to argue that OS and first party software <strong><em>isn&rsquo;t</em></strong> better than iOS."</p>
<p>The &#8220;grid of icons&#8221; has been the used fandroid excuse for iOS being stale for years now.</p>
<p>You mean like 2 years? lol.</p>
<p>its*</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a stale argument if it&rsquo;s still relevant.</p>
<p>Indeed!<br />
But for it to be relevant you would need some compelling exclusive apps on iOS.  Please list these exclusive compelling apps to support your argument.<br />
If you list Apple-made apps I&rsquo;ll counter with Google-made apps not available in iOS, so save some time and skip those.</p>
<p>Epoch<br />
Infinity Blade 1/2<br />
Laura Croft and the Cradle of Life<br />
Swordigo<br />
Rage HD<br />
Soulcalibur<br />
Tentacles by Microsoft Games Studios<br />
Vote The Game<br />
Trucks & Skulls</p>
<p>and that is just what I have on my phone.</p>
<p>We also get new apps about 3 &ndash; 12 months before Android.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how true that is anymore. <br />
At least the most popular apps have been coming out on both platforms simultaneously.</p>
<p>And again, any lack of apps should be evaluated on a personal basis and used accordingly as a personal deciding factor.</p>
<p>Cool, so anyone who cares enough about those particular games can use it as a deciding factor.</p>
<p>But pretending that the Android ecosystem is so lacks so much functionality due to lack of apps is an old argument</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I haven&rsquo;t found the Android ecosystem lacking to fit my needs.</p>
<p>Right. For example, I don&rsquo;t really play games on my phone, so&hellip; all of those apps listed make no difference to me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not lacking at all, but iOS still has a better app selection.</p>
<p>Yeah iOS definitely has a larger selection of apps.  But whether that&#8217;s better or inconsequential depends on a particular person&#8217;s needs.  That was my point.</p>
<p>There is no competitor to Airplay for Android. The pod-casting app from google is a joke. Alien Blue is a great app not on android. While there maybe be messaging services it is not integrated like ios messages. There is not a real office suite competitor from the company that made Docs which I love. I had a nexus 7 for about three months and sold it because while I loved the form factor I didnt enjoy the device. I like android and agree that glanceable information widgets need to come but besides google services it wouldnt replace my ipad in any measure. I do agree the ecosystem has many of the same functionality as iOS but its certainly lacking polish and developer support. ROMs are nice but really well made constantly updated apps arent always easy to come by.</p>
<p>Airplay sounds like a good feature; being able to &#8220;send&#8221; stuff from your tablet to the TV, or speaker system, etc. <br />
I guess Google&#8217;s somewhat equivalent is just being able to access your stuff from the cloud, so if you have movies, music or whatnot in your acct you could access it via your tablet, phone, or Google TV device.</p>
<p>I think its definitely coming but with you tube they have only recently gotten into the good graces of content owners. Which is a big part of airplay. Thus is also an opportunity for windows phone and smart-glass to compete so android really needs something. Its the tv box that seems to be holding them back. I look forward to a new google set top box since it seems to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>Also, Google&#8217;s Messenger has had the iMessage capability for years.  And Google Voice also allows you to sent SMS from your desktop as well as any device where you can install the app.</p>
<p>For Google Voice most people would have to take the plunge of switching to a new phone #, but I did that a couple of years ago and haven&#8217;t looke Andd back.   if you&#8217;re on Sprint then Google Voice ties straight into your Sprint mobile #.</p>
<blockquote>it is not integrated like ios messages</blockquote>
<p>I disagree that it is at the same level. Im sure google messenger is good but there isnt a service stealing sms power from carriers like imessage is. Google wont dare as there already not very close to all big 3 carriers. But even if you buy an ipod touch you can communicate with any person on an ios device out of the box. Without even signing up for a service. I like google voice as well but I dont think its factors into what I was talking about. Plus its available on all the platforms.</p>
<p>With Google Voice, I can communicate via text with anyone (not just android devices). I can do it from my touchpad, from my laptop, from my work computer, from my nook color, from anything with an internet connection. I have been able to do this for quite a while.</p>
<p>Yeah cause its a phone service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stealing sms power from carriers like imessage is</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is exactly what Google Voice does.  You must not understand what it&#8217;s about.</p>
<p>Yeah but nobody really gives a shit about it. Ive been using voice for years and its really neat but far from popular. When iMessages launched it immediately had millions of users. I still blow peoples mind when I tell them what google voice is like they have never heard of it before. Because they really havent. Even android users often ignore this feature.</p>
<p>The great thing about it is that they don&#8217;t have to know what voice is. I am connected to the people who will never know what voice is by using google voice. You are connected to millions with imessage, but are not connected to tens of millions of others. I am connected to all of them.</p>
<p>Well thats fine but personally ,and I know this is true for many, often dont respond to calls that are unknown so I dont see how a random number trumps a full service that can be used with a number or email simultaneously, offers read receipts. I like google voice but I dont thinkimesssgae and it compete on may levels. In the sense of phonecalls they dont at all so Im in no way saying google voice is bad it actually saves me a ton of headache but its hard for me to say they are really on par.</p>
<p>Ummm&#8230;I use AirSync on android to Airplay stuff to my apple TVs all the time.  Also, all of my podcasts are synced to the cloud through google music.  I can access them from my phone or any other internet connected device.</p>
<p>Which is a 100% fool proof and not a loophole that can be closed. And Im pretty sure using itunes and google music doesnt give android a good podcasting app or integration. Ive used google music since beta and its great. But it doesnt really factor in to what im talking about.</p>
<p>I would love to have a podcast app that can actually finish a podcast without quitting, skipping or crashing.</p>
<p>Sometimes this makes me think about switching to iOS.</p>
<p>Googles simple pod-casting app for android is very light and I never had a problem with it crashing or skipping. Not the greatest looking but it seems to work well and keep your podcasts up to date.</p>

<p>This. This so freaking much! :]</p>
<p>Just so you know, I might be borrowing this for the future.</p>
<p>What apps?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an app for everything on Android, in fact there&rsquo;s hundreds of apps for everything.</p>
<p>Plus Google&rsquo;s apps are better & updated qith new features quicker on Android, which isn&rsquo;t a big deal for everyone obviously, but many, many people do use them everyday and throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sorry, no.  I have a Nexus 7 and I really want it to be usable, but the Android versions of apps are always worse than iOS.  Android is, to use J-Tops&rsquo; own words against his favorite OS, poison for apps.</p>
<p>the native apps on Android are superior, is what he is saying</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t claim that Android has better apps. In fact, I have an iPhone 5 because I need that superior ecosystem. I stated that there was more to the situation than the operating system in my original comment. (Sprint also doesn&rsquo;t have LTE in Minnesota yet, so that&rsquo;s no concern to me.)</p>
<p>Yea, stale or not,  there&#8217;s still a lot of great apps that are still exclusive to iOS. Like it or not, it&#8217;s still where the money is for 3rd party developers.</p>
<p>Lol at drastically innovative.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have unlimited LTE, then what is the point. You can go through 2GBs fast at 25MB/S. LTE is certainly nice, but not with a data cap. Sprint is the only good choice is service is available in your area.</p>
<p>This. Like having a supercar you can only drive in your backyard.</p>
<p>Agreed! I have the iPhone 5, and it&#8217;s a really solid phone. The size is right, the screen is gorgeous, and the LTE is blazing fast! If it had more functionality and customization features, I wouldn&#8217;t be thinking about the Nexus 4. But I&#8217;ve alway wanted a stock Android phone. I think this one is it, you can&#8217;t beat that price!</p>
<p>Yeah I know, who wouldn&rsquo;t pick the NExus 4</p>
<p>Nexus 4 + iPad Mini</p>
<p>This is the exact combo I want. I really want to experience the best of Google&rsquo;s software design, and I&rsquo;m willing to sacrifice LTE for that. But, I&rsquo;m still hooked on the many excellent third-party apps that iOS devs are making, and love the seven-inch tablet form factor. Hoping to run with these devices for 2013.</p>
<p>Note 2.  Only one device needed.</p>
<p>I personally would go for iPhone5. It has a better battery life. LTE. And is a faster performer than this phone, as proved by AnandTech. The only plus-point for Nexus would be that awesome spherical shoot. Its a great feature, something I feel might come to iOS soon.</p>
<p>Try the three-year old &#8216;360 panorama&#8217; app for iOS, it does a &#8216;sphere&#8217; capture.</p>
<p>iPhone 5? What?? What&rsquo;s that? Sounds dated, overpriced, and scratched. Pass.</p>

<p>I think I am going with the iPhone 5 this time.  In a year I&rsquo;ll decide again between the 5S and the next Nexus.  If everything goes perfect every other year I will get an iphone or a nexus.  Just sold my One X yesterday.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got an 4S and a Galaxy Nexus and, using a sim adapter, I toggle between them every now and again. I&rsquo;m far too much of a geek to ever settle on one platform and keeping two phones is far less costly than constantly buying new ones all the time.</p>
<p>Yeah I&rsquo;ve been doing that with my Lumia 900 and iPhone 4 and I carry both around everywhere (iPhone 4 primarily as an iPod). Problem now is I want both the 920 and the Nexus 4. The speed of the 920, which supposedly is faster than the 900, is amazing when it comes to how I interact with my UI. Syncing all my social networking platforms under one hub is also genius of MS. But I also want to have the customizability of the Android. A jailbroken iPhone 4 just isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>
<p>FUCK ALL THESE COMPANIES FOR TAKING MY MONEY!</p>
<p>Have you had any issues with your data plans? For some reason when I go iPhone &gt; Nexus &gt; iPhone I lose my tethering until I call AT&amp;T and give them my IMEI.</p>
<p>If every company sold their phones for 300 off contract like the Nexus 4, I would probably have all of them.  If none of them had LTE, I would just be sad.  I personally like the HTC 8X more than the Lumia 920 so I would go with that WP8.  Nexus 4 is nearly perfect except for lack of LTE.</p>
<p>But like @Joey Calamaro said I am also too much of a geek to settle on one platform.  I will always respect Apple and most importantly Jony Ive for his designs.  But I am always down to try to other phones out as well.  Too bad Off Contract prices are ridiculous.</p>
<p>That sounds like a terrible idea.  You&rsquo;re going to be spending double money on apps</p>
<p>Lumia 920 !!! &hellip; jk :)</p>
<p>1 iPhone5 or 2 Nexus4, that&rsquo;s the problem.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a problem. The iPhone 5 is just a faster, stretched iPhone 4S</p>
<p>How about a separate core for countries that don&rsquo;t have LTE.</p>
<blockquote>For other networks in other countries, and for the lucky T-Mobile customers out there that are getting great speeds on its HSPA+ network &mdash; great. No problem. Go get this phone. </blockquote>
<p>that&rsquo;s me. sold!</p>
<p>Me too, I live in China, I don&#8217;t give a rip about LTE here and nobody else cares either. Wifi is everywhere I need to be, and regular data speeds are good enough for the times I can&#8217;t access wifi.</p>
<p>I wish I was you. I live in Oregon in the US, which has great T-mobile HSPA+ in the Portland metro area (where I live), but also has amazing LTE from Verizon. Choosing the second fastest network is a hard thing for me to do. It would be an upgrade from my currently 3g iPhone 4, but still, choosing what is now second best to stick with for 2 years is a decision I&#8217;m not sure I can make, even though everything else about this phone makes me drool.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T now has LTE there too.  Should T-Mobile could easily be third in most places.   Just saying.</p>
<p>You do realize there is no reason to stick with the phone for two years unless you buy it on contract.  You can buy it, use it for a year or 6 months or 3 days, sell it and get a new phone. That&#8217;s the beauty of buying an off contract phone</p>
<p>sold me right there</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is why dude has to stay with AT&T, the worst carrier in the country.</p>
<p>Probably because it&rsquo;s the largest GSM network in the U.S. and has better phones than T-Mobile by far.</p>
<p>He uses an unlocked Galaxy Nexus from what I read here, so your second point is completely moot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he swaps phones constantly /jealousy</p>
<p>They have the largest GSM network, but I&#8217;m fairly certain that T-mobile has far more HSPA+ coverage than AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>No carrier covers every area well.  Maybe AT&T is better where he lives and works?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that hard.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s a city dweller (maybe I should not assume that, but I am) T-mobile is great.  It&rsquo;s just an observation.</p>
<p>I am a city dweller and T-Mobile sucked in my area when I had it.  Dropped calls, near nil building penetration.  It was fail, though that was a couple years ago.  Not every city, or even every area within a city is covered equally.</p>
<p>U know what happens when u assume things &hellip;</p>
<p>Not necessarily. In my city, certain areas of T-Mo&rsquo;s HSPA+ network ger 20+Mbps download speeds. In my side of town, it&rsquo;s closer to 3-6Mbps. I really want to get this phone, but I&rsquo;m afraid that I might not enjoy the experience I do with my Verizon Droid RAZR (I average ~15+Mbps at my house).</p>
<p>Best phone on the market*</p>
<p>*if you don&rsquo;t have access to LTE.</p>
<p>Or if, like me, you&#8217;re not ready to sell your kidney to be granted the privilege of being served 1GB a month by Verizon, in exchange for $80&#8230;</p>
<p>Sold!</p>
<p>This issue I found was that the Nexus 4 is a T-Mobile exclusive, and should have been reviewed on that network. Either that or, for parity, he should have bought an unlocked iPhone 5 and reviewed it on another carrier&#8217;s network and enjoy the wonderful 2g speeds and no lte.</p>
<p>You make too much sense.</p>
<p>Or maybe you should just accept the fact that this phone is only on one network, while the iPhone 5 is on several &#8211; with the iPhone 5 you can choose what type of network you want to be on.</p>
<p>This phone doesn&#8217;t have LTE, no matter how you compare it to an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>This phone can be used on all of the GSM networks, not just Tmobile.</p>
<p>You are correct that it doesn&#8217;t have LTE. However, there are a ton of LTE android phones to choose from if it is necessary to you.</p>
<p>And midwest states in US. Most of us don&rsquo;t have LTE. In Iowa, there&rsquo;s not a single city that has AT&T LTE.</p>
<p>This might be my next! Not sure yet though.</p>
<p>A bold move to put a glass back in a post-iPhone 4 era.</p>
<p>Review by Wired</p>
<blockquote>I took a set of keys, a fork and a pocket knife to the front and back glass panels of the Nexus 4 and couldn&rsquo;t get a scratch to show up anywhere. I also slipped and dropped the phone while pulling it out of my pocket this week, and it showed no signs of my fumble.</blockquote>
<p>Yet Josh&rsquo;s cracked (it&rsquo;s in the pictures, go look).</p>
<p>Glass &ndash; even of the Gorilla variant &ndash; is fickle when it comes to shock absorption. Anyone who&rsquo;s dropped a phone a dozen times just to have the screen go on a shorter, random fall knows this.</p>
<p>And didn&rsquo;t he say he was glad he hadn&rsquo;t just paid $300 for it. Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;you break it,  you bought it&rdquo; apply to reviewers?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t understand how careless one has to be to crack the screen of a touchscreen smartphone. Even after fate has tried, it has failed to nick any of my phones to date.</p>
<p>i dropped my iPhone 4 several times, it didn&rsquo;t break. Just because another reviewer dropped it once and it didn&rsquo;t break doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;ll withstand drops every time.</p>
<p>still: Metal dents and scratches, Glass breaks. pick your poison.</p>
<p>And plastic may feel cheap.</p>
<p>Exactly, metal dents and scratches, also gets warmer much quicker, Glass breaks, and plastic, while is technically the best material to use for phones&hellip;.. feels cheap and looks the worst.</p>
<p>It is a pick your poison type of thing, which ever suits you best, you just pick the one that you want.</p>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re all in with ios, then you have whatever apple tell you to have (plastic in 3g/s, glass in 4/s and metal in 5&hellip;</p>
<p>i actually like how metal absorbs your body heat and don&rsquo;t mind possible scuffs that in no way influence the functionality. (they do influence resale value, but i don&rsquo;t sell my old phones but pass them on to friends / family or keep them for spotify / nike+ running iPod-touch purposes)<br />
so i&rsquo;m pretty happy with the iPhone 5s build quality. <br />
personal taste, of course</p>
<p>You forget the all aluminum iPhone first gen, which I still think was the best iPhone design wise.</p>
<p>I loved it, but it was quite easy to dent.</p>
<p>Carbon fiber please&#8230;.</p>
<p>Samurai Pizza Cats!!!</p>
<p>Do we really want an <strong>indestructible Android</strong>?? Have we not learned our lesson??<img src="http://readjack.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/have-you-seen-this-boy.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is a difference between being scratch resistant and being brittle. Even strong, scratch resistant glass can crack if dropped because glass is inherently brittle.</p>
<p>This is certainly something to take into account for this phone. The glass back isn&#8217;t at all a problem for me. I have never dropped any phone that I&#8217;ve owned and then only thing that annoys me about the glass back of the iPhone 4 that I currently own is its tendency to obtain very light scratches just from being set down on a surface with one grain of dust on it. Since Gorilla Glass is nearly impossible to scratch, it sounds perfect to me.</p>
<p>What the shit did Joshua do to it? Took it to Cupertino&#8230;</p>
<p>SOLD!</p>
<p>Yep, I&#8217;ve had no problems with the glass backs on my iPhone 4 and my iPhone 4S&#8230; They stay shiny and new-looking, because glass just has it like that.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a big deal at all. It&#8217;s a good material if you&#8217;re careful with it.</p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s riskier than plastic.   But the design does seem to be better at mitigating the risk than the iPhone 4.  The Nexus 4 basically has a rubber bumper built into it to absorb the worst kinds of drops on its corners/edges.</p>
<p>Hence Joshua&#8217;s counter troll</p>
<p>No camera sample pics? Is this a full review?</p>
<p>I would like to see pictures as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be added. There are however alot of impressive camera examples being posted on Google+.</p>
<p>google+ lower the image quality down to a jpg quality 92, I want to see it at its best.</p>
<p>Go to Engadget. lolz. <a href="http://www.engadget.com/photos/google-nexus-4-sample-shots/#5407213" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/photos/google-nexus-4-sample-shots/#5407213</a></p>
<p>Well, we should expect complete, in depth reviews of devices here. It&rsquo;s not a good sign when you have to go to some other site to see something that should be in The Verge aswell.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Poor battery life according to Engadget. But then again it&#8217;s Engadget.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s Engadget but Anandtechs preview seems to back them up on that.sigh&#8230;<br />
Maybee it&#8217;s a fixable firmware/software issue</p>
<p>It looks like the reviews feature different software :<br />

(scroll down to &#8220;munkustrap&#8221;)</p>
<p>If this had LTE, I&rsquo;d definitely buy it. Hopefully it&rsquo;ll show up on Sprint uncompromised like the other Nexus phones did.</p>
<p>Thats my secret hope as well. because of where I live it&rsquo;s either sprint or verizon for me. If i could switch to a pre paid plan that supported this i would but alas that is not feasible for me at this time.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve heard there is not going to be a CDMA version.</p>
<p>Google can&#8217;t get a carrier to do that. Not gonna happen.</p>
<p>Anyone else getting this?</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>The LTE issue isn&rsquo;t much a problem for me &ndash; HSPA+ here in Canada is 42 (8-12mbps in reality) and the rest of the time I&rsquo;m on WIFI. Nexus 4 will be in my pocket shortly after Nov 13.</p>
<p>Same here!</p>
<p>Oh yeah</p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
Note: LTE is not yet available in my country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only $350. Unlocked.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. I think this is a fine score, I don&rsquo;t actually really care about scores anyway, but your Reception/Cal Quality is a 6, despite saying in the review that it&rsquo;s great and your gripe is with the lack of LTE and the fact that HSPA+ on AT&T is slow, no mention of T-Mobile at all.</p>
<p>He does mention T-Mobile, but that he tested with AT&T.</p>
<p>He essentially tested the phone on a network that can only supply HSPA+21 when the phone is capable of HSPA+42.  Its like testing the WiFi by connecting it to an 802.11b router.</p>
<p>Not to make light of this week&rsquo;s events, but they&rsquo;ve been testing in what&rsquo;s probably the most disrupted cellular data market in the world at the moment, unless this review predates Sandy and was just waiting for embargo to lift.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that LTE speeds will be (and are) dropping in LTE markets as more and more users convert from EVDO and HSPA.</p>
<p>My cell service in NYC has been absolutely atrocious, I can confirm.</p>
<p>Not mine :p I am on T-mobile using my Galaxy Nexus and its fine I live in queens so it depends where you are in NYC. But my speeds did slow down a little after the whole At&amp;t and T-mobile sharing thing.</p>
<p>I should have noted that I was in the middle of blackout zone lower east side Manhattan.  The second I made it uptown everything was gravy.</p>
<p>At&amp;T &#8211; shit 3G</p>
<p>I completely agree with you, and I am an Android user for life or until WP improves and comes to Sprint. I feel like the reception/call quality score was a mistake, but the score is spot on for everything else.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible that he had no other category to include the lack of LTE in, so he simply threw it into Reception/Call Quality.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that&rsquo;s still a bad way to do it. If anything, there should be a Features category or something.</p>
<p>As this phone comes on t-mobile it would have made a wee bit more sense to tet it on their network, if even just to test out the speeds briefly.</p>
<p>I do understand that he may not have had the opportunity with Sandy and all and i&rsquo;m sure we will here plenty about speeds soon in the forum.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost 2013 and this phone doesn&#8217;t have an option for LTE &#8211; that is considered a reception shortcoming.</p>
<p>What other category would you put this shortcoming in?</p>
<p>The lack of LTE is, for lack of a better word, pathetic. I&rsquo;m deeply disappointed in Google for not demanding it.</p>
<p>Do you think the cost of $300 unlocked offsets that a bit?  I mean I can see people getting frustrated that the 4S didn&rsquo;t have it, but there was no other iOS option for another year plus (until the 5 came out).  With Android, at least there are a slew of other good LTE phones available.  I still am pissed about no LTE, but again I think the cost mitigates it a bit.</p>
<p>No. Not for a phone you&rsquo;ll most likely be spending the next year or more with. $50 more for LTE is worth it.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s to say that it would cost $50 more per device?  Also, dealing with getting timely updates soils the Nexus name.  It took Verizon way too long to get Jelly Bean on the Galaxy nexus.  I wish Google had the clout to push updates like Apple does, unfortunately, they do not.</p>
<p>I am in Germany I am so happy to pay the 299 and not waste a cent on the LTE which I do not need nor can use.</p>
<p>Germany has LTE.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;The U.S. has LTE&rdquo;. Or, &ldquo;The U.K. has LTE&rdquo;. Not very much at all&hellip;</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>US is far far bigger, for a start.</p>
<p>In Germany LTE has been around a lot longer than the UK.</p>
<p>I know because I live in Germany and previously in the UK.</p>
<p><img src="http://phone-guide-germany.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nokia-iphone-lte.jpg" /></p>
<p>On the right is areas Nokia claims have LTE support with its 820 or 920.</p>
<p>Diese ganzen Testgebiete und Tarife kann doch keine Sau bezahlen. Wir haben nichtmal ordentliche Geschwindigkeit bei 3G, im Vergleich zu Manhattan ist die Geschwindigkeit hier sogar da ein Witz. Deutschland hat kein LTE.</p>
<p>True. Last time I checked (Vodafone) LTE covers ~50% of the population. The Federal Network Agency hast obliged prividers with LTE spectrum licenses to cover 90% of the population with LTE by January 1, 2016.</p>
<p>Regarding the N4, I think LTE would have been a nice addition. But since HSDPA+ (with a coverage of ~80%) provides me with 15-25 mbit/s I can easily hold off for another year or so.</p>
<p>How much is it in the german play store ? , i&#8217;m from denmark and 3 has overpriced the shit out off it sadly :( , i havn&#8217;t seen any other carriers price release.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same overpricing here in Sweden but I saw the price of <strong>349€</strong> in Germany in a thread.</p>
<p>Thanks,  is that for the 16 GB ?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>€249 in the Netherlands and Germany. For the 16GB vesion now and for the 32GB version on preorder.</p>
<p>Honestly this is the main reason I don&#8217;t care about LTE at the end of the day the updates trump slightly faster speeds &#8230;.it seems pretty unfair to judge this phone based solely on piss poor AT&amp;T service  I feel like the review was colored too much by this</p>
<p>I think people just want something to wine about</p>
<p>Version are control-freak gimps that got out control-freaked by Apple. GSM Nexus 4? A big middle finger to lolvzw</p>
<p>Actually, they were talking in the livestream the other day and said an unlocked version would be at least $200 more if it hade LTE in it</p>
<p>Sign me up. LTE is worth the extra money.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to this phone. Oh well.</p>
<p>would you buy a $500 unlocked phone? most people wouldn&rsquo;t. They are trying to make a good phone which is cheap too so that people are motivated to buy it unlocked.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s more that no LTE carrier wanted to play ball with Google.</p>
<p>No way. I would not pay $500-600 for an unlocked phone and still have to pay full price for a tiered data plan. That&rsquo;s bonkers man. I&rsquo;m speaking of course for us here in the US. T-Mobile is the only one that lowers the price of your plan if you buy the phone unsubsidized and they don&rsquo;t have LTE.</p>
<p>For a radio? I have my doubts.</p>
<p>A radio and a bunch of licenses.</p>
<p>So the iPhone 5 costs Apple in the ballpark of $200 to make than the 4S?</p>
<p>That sounds a little far-fetched considering how much Apple guards their profit margins.</p>
<p>*in the ballpark of $200 <strong>more</strong></p>
<p>The cost of getting the LTE data plans in the UK means I will be using 3g for the next year anyway.  So even if the Nexus 4 had LTE I wouldn&#8217;t be using it.  Upgrading to the Nexus 4 is a no brained for me.</p>
<p>No, not in the slightest.  I&rsquo;m in the market for a premium device.  It would be one thing if they were selling both an LTE phone at normal pricing and the HSPA+ phone for $300, and people could take their pick.  But as of today I cannot purchase an LTE phone with stock Android on it.  That is a major issue for me.</p>
<p>You certainly can, the Galaxy Nexus is still being sold by Verizon.</p>
<p>And Sprint :)</p>
<p>I own and enjoy a Verizon Galaxy Nexus, but it can&rsquo;t exactly be called a premium device anymore.  In addition, Verizon sucks with updates.  It doesn&rsquo;t effect me as I flash a new ROM on day one, but for many people that is an issue.  Also, the camera, battery life (even with the extended battery), screen and design/materials are all far short of the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>I would have bought an N4 if it had LTE, despite wanting a removable battery, but it&rsquo;s a no-go for me given I still have a year on my current contract.</p>
<p>I got a vzw nexus on contract as well. And you&rsquo;re actually not adding much at all if T-Mobile is an option for you.<br />
Assuming &ldquo;still have a year on current contract&rdquo; is accurate, you will be paying a $350 &ndash; $10*12 = $230 early termination fee. Depending on contract tier, I have the cheapest option ($80/month), switching to T-mobile&rsquo;s $30/month (5-GB data) plan will save you $50*12 = $600 over the course of the remaining year. So you immediately gain $390, which puts cash BACK into your pocket even after shelling out $350 (+tax) on a 16GB N4. AND, given only the vzw nexus works on verizon, you might be able to sell it for around $100-$200. You&rsquo;re actually getting money back for switching, IF t-mobile is an option for you.</p>
<p>Yea, but I would be giving up LTE in a very good LTE market, and giving up my grandfathered unlimited plan.  I use a lot more than 5GB rather frequently (most months in the year due to tethering) and don&rsquo;t want to give up that and the low latency.</p>
<p>You have a point, it does eliminate some of the sting. But on the other hand if you have AT&amp;T and have one of their LTE phones, it a hard decision. Although the Nexus is $300 and $350 HSPA+ isn&#8217;t all that fast in the US, unless you&#8217;re on T-Mobiles network. I currently have an iPhone 5, and turned off my LTE radio and ran a few HSPA+ speed test. My average speeds where between 8 &#8211; 10 Mbps, which isn&#8217;t bad. Actually enough to satisfy me. But the radio technologies vary depending on the phone. I&#8217;ll need to see more reviews before I make a final decision. I really want this phone, but the iPhone 5 though its boring is overall a very solid device! It even beats the Nexus in screen quality, sound, battery, camera, storage capacity, and LTE of course.</p>
<p>The cost and the LTE aren&#8217;t related in the minds of people who want a Nexus device, and are willing to pay. Nexus devices are presented as the best Android option, and this lacks the modern high-speed standard that even <em>last year&#8217;s</em> Nexus had.</p>
<p>Amazing how lacking LTE is suddenly &#8220;No Problem!&#8221; now that it&#8217;s a Nexus doing it instead of the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Better to have no LTE than the only supporting some of the bands like iphones, since that is an anti competitive move, that will damage provider who didn&rsquo;t know that apple wouldn&rsquo;t support their banding. I would have to change provider if I want LTE on an iPhone because of that, that ain&rsquo;t okay.</p>
<p>No LTE support is worse than some LTE support, surely. I&rsquo;m in Sweden where there is LTE on several standard european frequencies yet the Iphone supports none of them. It sucks and I would have liked for Apple to sell a phone in Europe that has the radios supported by our networks but at least it supports 1800MHz. Eventually some carriers might roll out LTE 1800 here, and I&rsquo;m sure the number of networks operating LTE on 1800 around the continent will increase over time so I wouldn&rsquo;t rather the phone didn&rsquo;t support it.</p>
<p>that would mean you have to choose a provider <strong>because </strong>of the phone, that is a bad thing considering the fact that the carriers didn&rsquo;t know that when they bought their frequency. You might be fine with it, but it will damage the market, since some carriers will obtain monopoly/oligopoly, and create a state resemble that which USA is suffering under.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to choose a provider based on the phone at all. There are already plenty of carriers with lengthy exclusivity periods on phones that would do far worse harm in that regard. The Iphone is available on just about every carrier and completely unlocked and unsubsidised and it will work on just about every network in the world <em>but</em> it doesn&rsquo;t support LTE except on a few frequency bands. <br />
If through some dumb luck there are carriers that happen to have rolled out 1800 MHz first, as is the case with EE in the UK and some other carriers around Europe I sincerely doubt that them being able to offer LTE speeds on the Iphone, in some cases merely sooner, will tip the scales so severely in their favour as to cause damage to the telecom market.</p>
<p>What exactly is the harm? So what if one phone will have faster data speeds on just a few networks, 3G speeds are not horrible and there&rsquo;s every chance for carriers to compete on price and contract conditions and reliability and coverage. The Iphone isn&rsquo;t the only phone or the only one people are buying. It&rsquo;s not even the only one with LTE. It&rsquo;s not as if Apple is leaving out wider LTE support in a bid to abuse some monopoly position in the  smartphone market to prop up some partnered carrier or anything fishy like that.</p>
<p>What would be the alternative? Either something like the EU would have to not only help standardise which frequencies should be used for LTE in Europe but also dictate which order they are to be deployed and ban any devices that support extra frequencies or frequency sets out of order of what has been dictated  or we can realize that the spectrum situation is for historic reasons different in different states and that there are perfectly rational business reasons why some carriers roll out networks on certain frequencies in certain orders and their competitors choose differently and equally valid reasons why handset manufacturers might choose to only support some of those bands.</p>
<blockquote>If through some dumb luck there are carriers that happen to have rolled out 1800 MHz first, as is the case with EE in the UK and some other carriers around Europe I sincerely doubt that them being able to offer LTE speeds on the Iphone, in some cases merely sooner, will tip the scales so severely in their favour as to cause damage to the telecom market.</blockquote>
<p>You have a big misconception of &#8220;rolling out frequencies&#8221;, you need to buy a frequency to roll out on. The actuation have already been held and the carriers have already bought their frequency, they will be using for LTE, so it is NOT about rolling it out sooner, it is about some carriers NOT being able to support LTE on those phone.</p>
<blockquote>No LTE support is worse than some LTE support, surely.</blockquote>
<p>Not in the mind of an Android Apologist.</p>
<p>As an HTC One X user, I would  gladly trade LTE for battery life.</p>
<p>But the One X does not have LTE. The XL does.</p>
<p>The One X in the US has lte. The XL is different.</p>
<p>The XL is the american X.</p>
<p>The X in the rest of the world just has HSPDA+</p>
<p>My bad</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t judge you, it&rsquo;s a bit of a mess</p>
<p>The One XL is sold in the US and CA as the One X, but its basically all the One XL.</p>
<p>My bad :)</p>
<p>And as a HSPA/Tegra 3 One X user in an LTE market (Vancouver), I&rsquo;m also quite happy with not having the LTE version the carriers here offer.</p>
<p>As someone in a market (Dallas) well-served by HSPA+, I don&rsquo;t need LTE.  I regularly get 10+mbps on my galaxy nexus with T-Mobile, and AT&T has been getting better, too.  I hear of people actually getting 7-9 mbps on HSPA+ now around here.</p>
<p>LTE isn&rsquo;t that big of an issue, as long as you have HSPA+.</p>
<p>Keep in mind LTE voice will be rolling out before long.</p>
<p>In two years&hellip;</p>
<p>That may be a year, and that may only be on Verizon for the time being. LTE is SCARCE from the other providers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get this whole LTE thing like everyone has it deployed in every square inch of this country. People have LTE phones now and don&#8217;t get it at all&#8230; Which is a total waste on battery.</p>
<p>Its also VoLTE BTW.</p>
<p>yea i had a 13 hour layover in Dallas airport and was very impressed with the hspa on my Gnex there</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard adding LTE would have increased the price, but I&rsquo;m wondering if Google could have offered it without LTE, then offered a model with LTE.</p>
<p>they posted why it has no LTE, while LTE is an open network, CDMA however is not, and therefore any update that google wishes to push to its devices have to go through the carrier, which for google is unacceptable as it adds lengthy delays.</p>
<p>one day in the future when LTE is everywhere, CDMA will be retired and closed down and everyone will be happy.</p>
<p>why cant you just update from computer like your iPhone.</p>
<p>Yes, but every week you guys complain about the carriers having too much control and stifling innovation and manufacturers giving into the carriers pathetic demand.  But now Google decides to not deal with the same bull crap from the carriers a now it&rsquo;s pathetic? Really?</p>
<p>Exactly, I plan on switching to Straight Talk because I am sick of Verizon. Straight Talk is HSPA+ so no LTE on the Nexus 4 is not a big deal for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m switching to T-Mobile. I&#8217;m also sick of Verizon. They&#8217;re not getting a phone I really want, I&#8217;m not willing to pay $90 per month for 1 GB of data, and I&#8217;m not gonna pay full price for a phone and still have to pay full price for my plan. See you later Verizon, LTE is not worth it.</p>
<p>People want the carriers to lose influence over manufacturers, not just for manufacturers to avoid the carriers. Ideally any OEM could make whatever hardware they wanted and tell those dumb pipes to sell it and not block updates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s very US centric, the rest of the world solved this problem a decade ago.</p>
<p>Forgive us, a large number of Americans don&rsquo;t actually know there is &ldquo;the rest of the world&rdquo;&hellip;..Just like many of them find it ridiculous that most people not in non-english speaking countries, in fact, don&rsquo;t speak a word of english.</p>
<p>B-but&#8230;I saw a movie with two Chinese people speaking perfect Inglish!!</p>
<p>I have to agree, finally they are standing up to the carriers by making this a steal off-contract. Take the compromise.</p>
<p>(Easier to say this from the UK where LTE is still effectively moot)</p>
<p>Yes agree, will be selling my 6 month old GS3, with my 16gb micro sd and flip case to fund this direct from the play store, envirophone are offering me 250, probs get more off ebay, still end up with an upgrade of a phone&hellip;. win win</p>
<p>The way of the future! My Note is on Amazon&hellip;but might have to check out envirofone too. LTE is a no go in the UK. I will not, WILL NOT pay over the odds for bragging rights on EE. Nope.</p>
<p>This. Is. My. Next.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just simply not go with a contract that doesn&rsquo;t offer unlimited data. Especially at such inflated rates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got a nexus, and until LTE prices come down and the other carriers get on board, as tempted as I am, the galaxy nexus will last me fine&hellip; However, if I was sporting an older phone, I&rsquo;d get this in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>GIFFGAFF! Or even Virgin&rsquo;s new unlimited data for &pound;10. The solutions are there!</p>
<blockquote>I’ll just simply <strong>continue</strong> not go with a contract that doesn’t offer unlimited data.</blockquote>
<p>Sorr, just to clarify :)</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking on Envirophone, check out <a href="https://tradein.asda.com/" target="_blank">https://tradein.asda.com/</a> as well, they&rsquo;ve got the best prices I&rsquo;ve seen (believe it or not)&hellip;</p>
<p>I also have had decent prices from T-Mobile recycling.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got mine up on Craigslist already.  I&rsquo;m on StraightTalk with it so no LTE is fine by me.  We just got Verizon LTE but AT&T and T-Mo still clock in between 3-9Mbps.  As long as I can have that and not have Sprint&rsquo;s 28.8 modem speed 3G, I&rsquo;ll manage.</p>
<p>He keeps saying this, they aren&#8217;t sticking it to the carriers by not putting in LTE, they&#8217;re admitting defeat. And that sucks.</p>
<p>Wish I could reccomend this from my phone :(</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t deal with carrier bullshit and they have LTE</p>
<p>How about the fact that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;dirt cheap&rdquo;*?</p>
<p>*Compared to other devices.</p>
<p>Dirt cheap but sexy. Dirty sexy&hellip;.</p>
<p>OK. I&rsquo;ll get my coat&hellip;</p>
<p>Would&rsquo;ve had LTE if carriers in America weren&rsquo;t so lame&hellip;.</p>
<p>blah, blah, blah.  HSPA+ all the way.</p>
<p>What is pathetic is knocking the HSPA radio for being too slow when you tested it on a network that doesn&rsquo;t even enable DC-HSDPA.  The phone is sold on Tmobile and Tmobile actually enables the full capability of the phone, yet you test it on AT&T.  Also, you compare it to AT&T LTE, which is by far the fastest LTE because no one is using it at this point.  If you compared the speeds to Verizon, which is by far the most used LTE network, the speeds would be VERY VERY similar.</p>
<p>Altogether, it seems you guys are more concerned with being technology consumers then technology journalists, and this is a tough thing to say for a site I love so much.  At VERY least, as technology journalists, you should have explored the real differences between what this phone is capable of and the real world LTE landscape in the United States.  It is SAD that you didn&rsquo;t do that.  When Anandtech gets speeds on their preview of the Nexus 4 of over 22Mbps and The Verge is reporting speeds 25% of that, that is pathetic.</p>
<p>yes no one has an iphone 5 with LTE i heard they haven&#8217;t sold a single one.</p>
<p>And people refused to believe that when Phil Schiller said the same thing a year ago. Funny how attitudes change and people get sensible when it&#8217;s a Nexus device that suddenly looks like it shipped with &#8220;last year&#8217;s technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think the main difference is that if an apple devotee wanted LTE last year what were they to do? If an android fan wants LTE this year, they have roughly 5,683,884 phones to choose from. This one just doesn&#8217;t happen to make it 5,683,885</p>
<p>Pathetic is a strong word.  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d also use it if they released another LTE Nexus that flat out got updates 2-4 months behind the GSM version.  So they can&rsquo;t win either way, so why not do it the way that would enable them to make a cheap phone that&rsquo;ll probably dominate the markets outside of the US?  Also, I find it ridiculous that people who aren&rsquo;t on the inside of a negotiation, just assuming it could have gotten done in a real way.  It&rsquo;s obvious Google(or anyone) doesn&rsquo;t have the clout of Apple to make the kinds of demands that would be needed to have an unmolested LTE Android phone at this point.</p>
<p>Ok, you guys deleted 2 very respectful comments criticizing, in a rational way, the shortsightedness of this review. Third time&rsquo;s the charm, they say, so here it goes:</p>
<p>- Most of the world has no access and won&rsquo;t have access to LTE in the next few years. Considering that, how would this phone be scored? Can any editor answer that, please?</p>
<p>To call the lack of LTE &#8220;pathetic&#8221; is laughable. What has happend all of the sudden that creates the need for LTE in the lives of most people?</p>
<p>Fast data is cool, sure, but HSPA really works for a lot of people.</p>
<p>According to the PCMag test results, T-Mobile average download is actually faster in Chicago (where Chris lives) than Verizon LTE, and just slower than AT&amp;T LTE, but they are all basically the same. Kind of ironic don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p><img src="http://www1.pcmag.com/media/images/348410-fmn-chart-chicago-500.jpg?thumb=y" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it.  Until we have solid prepaid SIM only LTE options, why is LTE that big of a deal?  Sure you can have faster speeds on LTE but if we had better HSPA+ options that wouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal.  The problem here isn&#8217;t so much LTE as it is the combination of LTE/CDMA, the latter being what is mucking up the works.   Most people don&#8217;t even need LTE, they would be better off with a cheaper prepaid plan through StraightTalk or T-Mobile.  The only way that the carriers will ever improve here is by having people thumb their nose at the current order of signing contracts for two years.</p>
<p>The Verge complains about the control of carriers, but doesn&#8217;t want people to actually do something about it.</p>
<p>Totally. It was only a big deal to not have LTE when Apple didn&#8217;t have it. Now that you can&#8217;t get an LTE version of this Nexus 4, it&#8217;s totally cool not to have LTE.</p>
<p>for the people for whom LTE is a big deal (probably the same people making a fuss last year), it is probably still unacceptable and they, therefore, won&#8217;t be buying this phone. For all others, this is an option.</p>
<p>iPhone devotee here, but man MUST I concede that this is one sweet looking phone plus the Android platform lately has been giving me serious envy!</p>
<p>LTE is not a biggie for me as well. <strong>Sigh</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keeping my iPhone 5 but I&rsquo;m going to pick up a Nexus 4 also and stick it on a T-mobile data only plan for $30. This way I can use Google&rsquo;s hugely superior maps and stream my music through Spotify while a travel without wasting the battery and data of my iPhone which I use for work. Work/Fun</p>
<p>This! I was debating on buying it to give my iPhone 5 a rest and use from time to time. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m gonna do it now since I&#8217;ve got attached to LTE speeds. It is a nicely designed device though. +1 to google.</p>
<p>Iphone 4s: <br />
Glass and metal design is beautiful, but easy to shatter</p>
<p>LG Nexus 4: <br />
Glass backing breaks easily</p>
<p>Guess you must have missed the bit where Josh said he liked how the holographic back of the Nexus looks.</p>
<p>and the part where the rest of the phone is pretty boring.</p>
<p>Not that that&rsquo;s necessarily bad, but it&rsquo;s a very generic design with a fancy glass back.</p>
<p>And I suppose the front of the iPhone looks magical?</p>
<p>Are you talking about the iPhone 4S?</p>
<p>Did you read the full review? I don&rsquo;t think you did.</p>
<p>Some reviews said that they didn&#8217;t have a problem with the glass&#8230;. some even said they tried to scratch it.</p>
<p>yes its gorilla glass its hard to scratch.</p>
<p>Well when you are with sprint, any thing is an update, sign me up.</p>
<p>Fortunately the back is easy to remove. A couple screws and clips and you have access to the battery as well.</p>
<p>No LTE is a bummer&hellip;</p>
<p>Makes me think of the revolt if the iPhone 5 would have had if it didn&rsquo;t come with LTE.<br />
Oh wait&hellip;</p>
<p>For the price of $300..</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sYWyi.gif" /></p>
<p>Aw he&rsquo;s dead :(</p>
<p>These GIFs keep getting better.</p>
<p>Price = 10</p>
<p>Excellent price. Problem is it a great price tor a premium phone or will the low price make people think it is a mid range phone?</p>
<p>Who cares what people &ldquo;think?&rdquo; Everything about this phone except LTE screams high-end. LG really stepped it up for this in a way in which Samsung didn&rsquo;t with the Gnex.</p>
<p>Of course, LTE is a rip off for most people.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m sure you never ever care about what other people think webran because you&rsquo;re cool. i&rsquo;m talking about whether this will influence purchasing decisions or not. to me the bezel, especially the bottom doesn&rsquo;t look too good. it reminds me of a couple of mid range samsung phones. yes i do care about phone aesthetics and that does influence my phone choice. do i think its a beautiful phone, no. but much like a ford, it does the job (presumably).</p>
<p>I think Webran is just trying to say that it doesn&#8217;t really matter what other people think because all of the people here commenting know that it is actually a very high end phone. I think the phone looks amazing. Although it isn&#8217;t exciting, save for the cool holographic back, I love that it is very understated, minimalistic, and so sleek, especially when turned off. The bezel looks fine to me, but you don&#8217;t seem to be the only one that has a problem with it. I just don&#8217;t see it, personally.</p>
<p>Consumers think in terms of post-contract prices. When asked how much an iPhone costs you would say $199. Nexus 4 is $299. The mentality would still likely suggest that it is an expensive phone.</p>
<p>I still find it odd that subsidised prices in the US don&#8217;t vary based on the monthly cost of the contract.</p>
<p>The thing is&#8230;you can only get the subsidy if you get a smartphone plan.  They cover their cost on the minimum post-paid smartphone plan, and anyone that pays above that is just gravy.</p>
<p>T-Mobile has it for $200 on a 2 year contract as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. Let&#8217;s hike up the price as high as we can get away with, and let&#8217;s see how many fools we can separate from their money.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Steve Jobs, circa 2006</p>
<p>The price makes people shit the bed.</p>
<p>Funny how they never mentioned the incredible price in the review at all. A low price for a newly released high end phone.</p>
<p>They did in the good/bad summary.</p>
<p>Price = this one goes to 11</p>
<p>Funny as an American the price is a big fat 4. I&rsquo;m going to get a phone to use in a 2 year contract I won&rsquo;t be using pre paid. So I don&rsquo;t get any savings. Its also 150 dollars more than most phones at the same level.</p>
<p>For  me it&rsquo;s absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>$200 on contract with T-mobile.</p>
<p>Also, why would you use it on contract when you could save money and not use it on contract?</p>
<p>Because he&rsquo;s an idiot.</p>
<p>Nice. Have you thought that T-Mobile gets 0 service where I&rsquo;m at? No I guess not.</p>
<p>Have you thought that this phone can also be used on ATT&#8217;s prepaid plans? Imma go out on a limb and say no&#8230;</p>
<p>Actually no I hadn&#8217;t. But there are to many other drawbacks like price and lack of 4G for me to consider it anyhow.</p>
<p>StraightTalk uses AT&amp;T&#8217;s HSPA+ network.  If you&#8217;re in an area where Verizon is the only carrier and neither AT&amp;T or T-Mobile is there, then that sucks for you, but you&#8217;re in such a weird situation that no one is going to think of you anyway.</p>
<p>No shit that&#8217;s why I said &#8220;For <strong>me</strong> it&#8217;s absolutely terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Straight talk (using ATT&#8217;s network) is 45 bucks a month. You can spend (best case scenario) $200 on contract for a roughly equivalent phone on sprint, then pay 85+ (with taxes and everything per month for two years). You would save about 40 bucks a month. Now instead of paying 200 on contract, you would have to pay 350 off contract. so you are paying an extra 150 up front. You would be in the black in 4 months! The remaining 20 months of what would be your contract are all money in your pocket! I can understand the lack of LTE being a drawback with you, but price is not a drawback. You would save (minimum) 800 by going this route. You would save enough money in one year that you could buy next year&#8217;s nexus (assuming similar pricing) and STILL come out ahead. Before you say something about not being on sprint, and needing verizon, I used sprint because it is the lowest cost alternative to T-mobile, which you said you cant use, and ATT which you hadn&#8217;t thought of.</p>
<p>Price of my Lumia? Also 10! Pre-ordered it from Best Buy for that lovely cheap price. Next I&rsquo;ll unlock it and use it on T-Mo for the $30 pricing. #win</p>
<p>To be honest, I could care less about LTE. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s something work getting hung up over. LTE coverage is still very sparse. Most people probably don&rsquo;t even live in an LTE area, especially since the Nexus only supports GSM carriers. Now if LTE were as ubiquitous as 3G is, then that&rsquo;s different. But it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>LTE is GSM</p>
<p>In the US the only gsm  carrier that has LTE is att  and they don&#8217;t have a very large footprint for it yet &#8230;Verizon and sprint have LTE networks as well but run their voice over CDMA</p>
<p>Seriously. <em>Couldn&rsquo;t care less.</em></p>
<p>Like I said above: I wish Google offered to models; one with LTE and one without.</p>
<p>EE is a joke.</p>
<p>In the US, LTE is essential. If Google had offered two models in the US, I&rsquo;m certain this would have got 8.9-9.1.</p>
<p>No, not essential. Not essential unless your job depends on it. You know how I know it&#8217;s not essential? The majority of the people think that Sprint&#8217;s 4G is the same as Verizon&#8217;s 4G. Why? They don&#8217;t care how fast their connection is. As long as it loads their web page, video, song, and downloads their latest app or update relatively quick, they&#8217;re happy. LTE speeds are far from essential.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s so ambivalent that he could care less but doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Its not that simple. They would LTE isn&#8217;t interoperable here and they would need 3 different models for Sprint, AT&amp;T and Verizon. That, versus one model that can serve damn near the whole world, where HSPA+ 42Mbps can be just as fast as LTE with less battery drain.</p>
<p>I agree it&rsquo;s not a big deal in some cases but it can&rsquo;t be ignored how many markets Verizon LTE is in.</p>
<p>I think the design looks pretty dated to be honest.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s absolutely futuristic.</p>
<ul>
<li>No physical buttons on the front</li>
	<li>No breaks, cut outs, dug outs or seams on the glass anywhere</li>
	<li>A simple monolith all around &ndash; minimal just like the software<br />
*The disappearing/reappearing pattern on the back</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside the tacky chrome lining, it&rsquo;s gorgeous.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to get my order in for one of these. Lack of LTE is not a deal break for me currently as only in a tiny number of UK markets. When it comes to getting a new phone in 12months I hope there will be an LTE nexus</p>
<p>Josh, how does the camera quality compares to iPhone 5 and s3?</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it use the same set-up as the i5?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>This obsession with the lack of LTE really shows The Verge&rsquo;s &ldquo;rich guy&rdquo; bias. None of the poor bastards I know really care about this issue because they&rsquo;re all on T-Mobile anyway. The one issue us poor shmucks DO care about is the lack microSD card, because so many of us run our phones on pre-paid data or even WIFI-only, so we can&rsquo;t depend on cloud streaming of our massive (ill-gotten) music collections.</p>
<p>Wait, so when Apple doesn&rsquo;t come out with the latest tech, oh they&rsquo;re far behind, but Google gets a pass?</p>
<p>Nope.  Unacceptable and microSD isn&rsquo;t a necessary feature if it can be hooked up to the computer (which I assume it can be).</p>
<p>Say what? I don&rsquo;t care what Apple does, because  they aren&rsquo;t on T-Mobile and I don&rsquo;t like their products.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unacceptable and microSD isn&rsquo;t a necessary feature if it can be hooked up to the computer (which I assume it can be)&rdquo;</p>
<p>LOL, what are you talking about? If the internal storage is too small and you can&rsquo;t add a microSD card&hellip; there&rsquo;s no substitute or workaround for that doesn&rsquo;t involve streaming over the internet, which is undesirable for many people!</p>
<p>While I do think there are streaming options to be had on the cheap, I still share your concern for the storage limitations. At least if there was a 64GB option, I think a lot of people (here!) would&#8217;ve been willing to pay a couple of bucks extra.</p>
<p>well to me Apple just got a pass on the iPad Mini.</p>
<p>Why are you getting so defensive about Apple? He never mentioned them. He&rsquo;s saying LTE is not important to him so why are you trying to force your opinion on him?</p>
<p>The difference here is you are not forced to use this phone if you want an Android device. You have a hundred other phones to choose from. Whereas with Apple, you&rsquo;ve only got one iPhone each year, and you have to put with what they give you until they add in what it is that you want.</p>
<p>Need LTE? Then get the One X, GSIII, or the many other Android devices with LTE.</p>
<p>Or if you MUST have a Nexus 4 + LTE, get the LG Optimus G.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t release phones for $300 unlocked.</p>
<p>This is not a flagship device per se.  This is a near flagship device at a mid-range off-contract price.</p>
<p>Face it, it would be worse if Google released a Fake Nexus on Verizon and got screwed again.</p>
<p>So, this site is supposed to be about tech reviews for the impoverished? If poverty is the issue, your next cell phone should be the least of your concerns.</p>
<p>LOL, no, that&rsquo;s not what I said. My point is that The Verge has a bias towards usage scenarios that aren&rsquo;t necessarily representative of their entire readership.</p>
<p>And Josh said that if you don&rsquo;t care about LTE it&rsquo;s a great phone. What more do you want?</p>
<p>Yeah but if you listen to the podcasts they can&#8217;t stop whining about LTE. It could have ended with &#8220;If you absolutely want LTE, get another phones&#8221;.</p>
<p>Do you know what the podcast is? It&#8217;s about the Verge team&#8217;s opinions. If they just talked about facts it might as well be a dramatic reading of the week&#8217;s posts.</p>
<p>You expect the review to be based on usage scenarios that accurately represent the entire readership?</p>
<p>The readers to be desired are ones with a chunk of disposable income.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on The Verge&#8230;.of insolvency!</p>
<p>I agree &ndash; I&rsquo;d rather have expandable storage that doesn&rsquo;t cost 50 bucks for 8 gigs&hellip;.</p>
<p>RICH GUY BIAS? ROTFLLLL You Android fans have some clear double standards. When the iPhone didn&rsquo;t have LTE?<br />
When Windows Phone was stuck with last years specs?<br />
Now the iPhone and Windows Phone have higher capacity storage and LTE and they&rsquo;re complaints from you fans lol</p>
<p>You&#8217;re making yourself look stupid by making general statements about Android fans as an answer to a specific comment. He expressed his views, not some manifesto for all users of Android.</p>
<p>Well, T-Mobile also has a reasonably priced unlimited plan, as well as a 5GB pre-paid plan for us poor people to stream away.</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s still worth getting the Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>Not if you can buy one for less than $250. Gnex is discontinued and off  the play store. I would suggest getting Nexus 4 for 300 bucks which is an excellent price.</p>
<p>I have one and have liked it, but I am ready to move on to something with better battery life, screen and camera.  N4 would have been it&hellip; but no LTE = no buy for me.</p>
<p>If only it costs 200))</p>
<p>probably not. About the same price now I think but the N4 is more advanced.  Except for the lack of LTE.  Your decision.</p>
<p>If they created a Nexus for Sprint&rsquo;s 4G, they will def. make a few LTE ones. Wasn&rsquo;t the last GNex on Verizon&rsquo;s LTE?</p>
<p>Google is trying to send a message to Verizon: Fuck you.</p>
<p>And they should. Verizon refusing to push updates in a timely fashion, insisting on bloatware, and blocking Google Wallet in an attempt to stop from becoming &ldquo;just a carrier&rdquo; is the antithesis of the Nexus line.</p>
<p>The other reason I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll make an LTE variant is because I imagine LTE radios/chipsets are still rather pricey, and would drive the price up too much.</p>
<p>Concerning Verizon, I absolutely agree. However, as discussed on that impromptu G+ Hangout, AT&T will allow any phone with LTE on their network. So, Google <em>could</em> have built an version with that LTE band support, but that comes back to your second point, cost. There&rsquo;s no way they could have built that kind of phone for even under $400.</p>
<p>I would have loved for them to release a version with LTE support, because then I&rsquo;d be much more inclined to get that. But alas, this mobile landscape with LTE blows.</p>
<p>But that LTE support for AT&T &ndash; is it the same bands for Europe?  Or are LTE bands a clusterfuck all around the world?  Why add that for whatever the cost if you&rsquo;re only going to sell a few of them, because face facts &ndash; most people in the US don&rsquo;t buy unlocked phones.  <br />
At this price, maybe they will, AT&T LTE be damned.</p>
<p>Going by what the iPhone 5, AT&T, Bell, Rogers, and Telus all use the same LTE bands, so it would have &ldquo;worked&rdquo; with those four. But worldwide they would have multiple phones just the like iPhone 5, obviously not the ideal situation.</p>
<p>While the <strong>overwhelming</strong> majority of people in the US don&rsquo;t purchase off contract phones, an unlocked LTE-capible phone for say $400 would definitely turn some heads. I fully believe that the goal of this phone is to get people to realize they can get amazing phones without the subsidy, but like Josh said, the lack of LTE is definitely a knock.</p>
<p>I am OK with them telling Verizon &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo;,.  Problem is, as a Verizon customer who enjoys the network quality and speed of LTE in my market, I won&rsquo;t be buying an N4.  I bought the GN on release day and am exactly the target market for this release as well, but I just can&rsquo;t go back, particularly when many of us who bought the GN on contract won&rsquo;t be able to leave Verizon for another year without paying an ETF.</p>
<p>can&rsquo;t go back to non-LTE speeds that is*</p>
<p>What about when you have to upgrade and get rid of your unlimited data plan? I&#8217;m on the same boat. I currently pay $85/month for 450 minutes, unlimited text and data. If I upgrade, I&#8217;m forced into a Share Everything plan. I&#8217;d be paying the same amount for 1 GB of data. Are you willing to do that? Your other option is to pay full price for a phone. There isn&#8217;t a phone worth paying that much for on Verizon. Even if you do that, you still have to pay full price for your plan. It&#8217;s a load of crap. LTE, in my opinion, is not worth it. HSPA+ will do. Especially at $30-50 a month with unlimited data.</p>
<p>Word.</p>
<p>LMAO, All of THIS! I have the Verizon Gnex&#8230; They crippled it and ruined the Nexus Brand and experience. Google won&#8217;t bother with their shit again.</p>
<p>You have some good points regarding Verizon and Nexus phones. But I never understood why Verizon gets such hate for their stance on Google Wallet when Sprint is the only one of the big four carriers that support it. And technically, Verizon doesn&#8217;t &#8220;block&#8221; Wallet since I&#8217;ve been using it since last December.</p>
<p>These reviews are getting REALY good! The formatting on it&rsquo;s own is just stunning.</p>
<p>This is my next. Anyone want to buy a One X?</p>

<p>Fry is going to buy two according to that picture!</p>
<p>Astute observation, my friend.</p>
<p>Yes complain about the lack of LTE because if they had included it an had to make several different version that didn&rsquo;t get update you can be on the vergecast &ldquo;Hey google why isn&rsquo;t my nexus 4 on Verizon updated ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regular consumers wouldn&rsquo;t notice a lack of immediate software updates. Regular consumers <em>will absolutely</em> notice a lack of LTE.</p>
<p>But the Nexus line isn&rsquo;t necessarily about &ldquo;regular consumers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Regular consumers can buy other LTE phones from Verizon, the Nexus project is about Google having control over the device, not a carrier, and Verizon has shown they won&rsquo;t play ball.</p>
<p>The thing is that Google wants the Nexus line to become more &ldquo;regular consumer&rdquo; friendly.</p>
<p>Absolutely, but at what cost? Google might market the phone to regular consumers now, but I don&rsquo;t think they want to give up on the vision of taking away some carrier control.</p>
<p>They tried compromise with Verizon for the GNex and it bit them in the ass, can&rsquo;t say I blame them for taking a different tactic.</p>
<p>And you can&rsquo;t argue with that price. If adding LTE costs ~$200, regular consumers still wouldn&rsquo;t buy it, going for an on-contract phone instead.</p>
<p>So catch22, and Google is taking the gamble.</p>
<p>Who said anything about being &#8220;regular consumer friendly&#8221;?? Regular consumers don&#8217;t care about the concept of stock Android; a Samsung with TouchWiz is perfectly fine for them. Not to mention Google has their partners to keep happy.</p>
<p>Exactly. First it was that consumers were irritated that their android device didnt get updated, but now we assume they dont care? On a NEXUS??</p>
<p>Thank You!!!</p>
<p>how many regular coustomers know what LTE means? really</p>
<p>Laser Technology Engineering.</p>
<p>Holy shit that&rsquo;s fast.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it means. Everyone can understand that.</p>
<p>No, you&#8217;re thinking about 4G.</p>
<p>I was actually thinking about 8G.</p>
<p>Really? Regular customers will absolutely notice that they are getting 7mb/s instead of 20mb/s?</p>
<p>They have no idea what LTE is. Most carriers dubbed HSPA+ "4G ", they will be Hally with that.</p>
<p>Most regular customers are going to base there purchase on a few simple factors, look and color, size, and most importantly price.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regular consumers&#8221; not doing the research and getting bent over royally on 2 year contracts is a big part of the problem.  Most &#8220;regular consumers&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t even be able to tell the difference between DC-HSPA and LTE.  Getting on a $30 T-Mobile or a $45 StraightTalk plan is worth it for most &#8220;regular consumers&#8221; but most assume that they have to get bent over on 2 year contracts when they don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>4MB/S is more than enough foe regular consumers, and this can go much faster. LTE isn&#8217;t required unless you are on a CDMA network in the US. LTE would be nice though. Too bad there isn&#8217;t a standard across networks.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s is the problem for general reviews, they never take into account what a device isn&rsquo;t trying to be. This isn&rsquo;t trying to be a GS3 or iPhone or 920 and google knows this. That&rsquo;s why they are bold enough to not include LTE. They made a comprise do something greater. I guess theVerge feels the need to judge based on the non comprised devices, although I think combined with the price and performance LTE shouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>He even mentioned that lack of updates trumped LTE for him &#8230;Verizon LTE is not any faster then when he had the galaxy nexus LTE</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good thing I hardly use my phone for calls, this is a 10/10 for me!</p>
<p>Hmmm, Just trying to understand your logic-<br />
1) You&#8217;re being sarcastic<br />
2) You didn&#8217;t read about the part of how voice calling was excellent but data speeds were little slow<br />
3) You&#8217;re going to say you were being sarcastic even though you were actually serious at the time and you think its clever to say that<br />
4) You&#8217;re constantly on wifi so you don&#8217;t even use a carrier (best answer but really?)<br />
5) You only text and take pictures and read the Settings menu<br />
6) You were not being sarcastic.</p>
<p>Google can&rsquo;t afford to just release a separate version for AT&T or Verizon that is LTE compliant?</p>
<p>Here is an experiment: Sell the phone on AT&T with LTE and on contract, and sell your own version unlocked. Make it clear that the AT&T version will get updates a month or two after the unlocked version.</p>
<p>What sells more? AT&T by a mile, most likely.</p>
<p>Better yet, why can Apple force its LTE carriers to offer instant OS upgrades while Google cannot?</p>
<p>Why should Google have to make variants? Ever wondered what.</p>
<p>Google is selling this in more then 1 country you know.</p>
<p>So is apple. Multiple devices in various countries ,what&#8217;s stopping google.</p>
<p>American-centric idiots.</p>
<p>AT&T sells 75% iPhones.  Why bother?</p>
<p>Google CAN release a separate version for AT&T that is LTE compliant (unlocked, so they still control upgrades).</p>
<p>Verizon, however, does not work the same way I believe. Whereas AT&T allows unlocked phones on their network, Verizon requires that phones be whitelisted in order to use their network at all. Google would have to go through the same terrible experience they had with the Verizon Galaxy Nexus in order to get their phone on Verizon, and they certainly don&rsquo;t want that.</p>
<p>The AT&amp;T version would outsell the unlocked version because most people still buy their phones in stores. They might not have a clue that they could buy it online and I&#8217;d bet they also have no idea what LTE is beyond some tech buzzword they might have heard on some commercial. Not a valid comparison.</p>
<p>Hmm Gizmodo says unfinished software, buggy camera, lousy battery life, and the finish guarantees  you&rsquo;ll drop it.  8.3 sounds right.</p>
<p>lol is Gizmodo still a thing? I thought they committed seppuku after Steve Jobs shunned them :P</p>
<p>I agree,  just going thru all the reviews. Really want the nexus 10.</p>
<p>Wired gave it a 9</p>
<p>Wired&rsquo;s reviews are generally more trustworthy than the Verge, Gizmodo, Engadget, etc&hellip; But still. This is pre-release software, so no one should put much stock in these reviews.</p>
<p>I bet you guys will consider Gizmodo if you&rsquo;re considering the Surface review.</p>
<p>Seriously, Gizmodo?</p>
<p>Gizmodo? You mean the site that is still posting via Tumblr because they can&rsquo;t be bothered to call another data center?</p>
<p>Gizmodo is utter garbage.</p>
<p>Gizmodo is a joke of a tech blog site.</p>
<p>Gizmodo said the battery was so so. But everything else? You trollin bro? They loved the camera</p>
<p>Lack of LTE being a con on this device is like going out to buy the iPad mini and then complaining that the screen isn&rsquo;t bigger. Don&rsquo;t think less of a device that does what its supposed to and the price is justified.  I could understand this being a big issue if it was missing LTE and cost 600$ off contract, but its half that price.</p>
<p>Bad analogy.  With iPad- if you want a larger screen (or with LTE instead of just WiFi), you can opt for one for a higher price.  The Nexus 4 on the other doesn&rsquo;t provide an option to those wanting and willing to pay higher price for a feature so paramount to a mobile device- connectivity.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s exactly the point. This phone is not marketing itself toward those people. It&rsquo;s for the people who are fine without LTE. The fact that there isn&rsquo;t an alternative should not be a negative against this device in particular.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>
<p>So true, look at the price point and compare it to what you are buying.</p>
<p>It worries me that these sites we listen to actually thought there would be lte. I think once we all knew Google was selling it threw the play store it would have no lte. To use lte you have to agree to the carriers terms! Then months later when Verizon doesn&#8217;t upgrade the phone its a whole new problem. Like you said 300 is the price not 600 so the device can not be knocked for that!</p>
<p>I hate to harp on this, but you&rsquo;re telling me this Camera is as good as the iPhone&rsquo;s?  and as good as the  Nokia Lumia 920&rsquo;s?</p>
<p>I think you guys should quit posting scores.. They cause a lot of bickering and they are never consistent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the best camera on a phone, that&rsquo;s for sure&rdquo; &ndash; Topolsky<br />
= 8 apparently</p>
<p>ridiculous&hellip;</p>
<p>not best = x &lt; 10</p>
<p>Scoring is dead.</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>I think I know how they determine the scores<br /><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img812/3615/southparkbm.png" /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz-PtEJEaqY&feature=related" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz-PtEJEaqY&feature=related</a></p>
<p>absolutely not, the scoring is what makes it fun!!!</p>
<p>No, insecure people should just stop posting ABOUT the scores and realize its just one persons opinion. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Different metrics for different features of the camera. Its not just about megapixels, low light conditions etc.</p>
<p>Its about how all of thats combined.</p>
<p>Right, and it looks like this one still come short of the iPhone , 920, and others</p>
<p>Camera on a smartphone covers more than just image quality.  It&rsquo;s mostly about ease of use and the simplicity of obtaining consistent result.  The Nexus 4 image quality is probably not as good as the 920 but the camera app makes up for the image deficiency.</p>
<p>One thing about the 920, with the exception of its lowlight ability, it isn&rsquo;t quite as remarkable people were expecting.  The daytime images captured seems to have varying tonal balance- from red to blue which is indicative of WB issue.</p>
<p>The white balance issues will with 99.9% likelyness be fixed with a software update just like with the Lumia 800.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo; t seriously expect them to review products based on the possibilities of future updates.</p>
<blockquote>&hellip;the possibilities of future updates</blockquote>
<p>?</p>
<p>This is what makes the Nexus line so attractive to a lot of people. This is almost what defines the Nexus brand.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re a going to fix certain issues.</p>
<p>Right, but I think thats still in the top tier with the iPhone.  It sounds like this one is a notch below</p>
<p>Woohoo. 10 performance and software. The two most important things to me</p>
<p>This got a ten for performance where the iPhone 5 received a 9?  Anandtech&rsquo;s tests are painting a somewhat different story: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6425/google-nexus-4-and-nexus-10-review" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6425/google-nexus-4-and-nexus-10-review</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not knocking the Nexus, considering contract it&rsquo;s way less expensive than the iPhone. Is there some metric in the &ldquo;performance&rdquo; section beyond speed and battery life I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with?</p>
<p>I think they score by real world metrics, not benchmarks :)</p>
<p>I reread the battery section, several times. My understanding is it&rsquo;s based off of two days of &ldquo;average use&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, it seems like a ludicrous amount of time and/or precision with which to measure battery life. Not that benchmarks are the be all end all, but &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it off of its charger for 10 hours and 30 minutes and it&rsquo;s still got 45 percent battery life. Yesterday before I plugged it in, I&rsquo;d had it off the charger for 16 hours, with 18 percent of its juice left&rdquo;, seems like quite a leap to arrive at a ten.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think battery life is a factor in the performance score &ndash; they have a separate score for battery life.</p>
<p>About the performance score, here&rsquo;s an interesting observation : <br />
iPhone 4S &ndash; 9, Galaxy Nexus &ndash; 10,<br />
iPhone 5 &ndash; 9, Nexus 4 &ndash; 10.</p>
<p>Make of it what you will, but I think that Josh&rsquo;s feelings about the OS (in this case, his effuse praise of Andoid 4.2) seep over into the performance score.</p>
<p>For the Galaxy Nexus, ICS was a huge upgrade from Gingerbread &ndash; such a fluid experience on an Android phone must have been a shocker </p>
<blockquote>The Galaxy Nexus feels blazingly, stupidly fast to me &hellip;.. the Nexus is probably the tightest feeling, snappiest Android phone I&rsquo;ve ever used. It&rsquo;s awesome. </blockquote>
<p>In this case,  just look at  <br /></p>
<blockquote>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, iOS is a beautiful and well-structured mobile operating system &mdash; but it&rsquo;s begun to show its age. It feels less useful to me today than it did a couple of years ago, especially in the face of increasingly sophisticated competition. I always have this sense now in iOS of not knowing where I am, what my status is &mdash; constantly having to load things and reload them. It feels tiring&hellip;. it didn&rsquo;t take me very long with the iPhone 5 to start thinking about getting back to the Galaxy Nexus and Jelly Bean (Android 4.1). For what I do, I think it&rsquo;s a more effective, more elegant, and more powerful OS right now.</blockquote>
<br />
versus<br /><blockquote>All in all, the changes in Android 4.2 may seem subtle, but they come together to make a more cohesive, enjoyable, and responsive mobile operating system. Android may still have a slightly steeper learning curve than iOS or Windows Phone, but what you get in return for a little bit of extra effort is phenomenal. In just over a year, the OS has gone from a nice-but-flawed experiment to a sleek, sophisticated, and incredibly smart platform. I don&rsquo;t feel any hesitation in saying that the pure Android 4.2 experience is &mdash; at least in my estimation &mdash; the most advanced mobile operating system on the market.</blockquote>
<br />
Some of this must have surely affected the way he scored the performace.
<p>you dont know what i know</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s probably because it&rsquo;s harder to get good battery life on Android so it&rsquo;s more notable when it&rsquo;s good. Also the linked performance review seems to be only browser performance (only glanced at the images)</p>
<p>&#8230;where Chrome has started to sick and lag. People oughta use Dolphin. Its a much better browser, but I hate that it doesn&#8217;t sync my account like Chrome. Just waiting for a much needed update.</p>

<p>Those latter 2 are battery tests :)</p>
<p>I know, lol.</p>
<p>The GPU tests all show the same thing.</p>
<p>This is a Anandtech <strong>preview</strong> yet your link says review, how come ?</p>
<p>Disregard my comment.<br />
The link says review, the site says preview</p>
<p>yup. fastest phone on the planet. way to go, google.</p>
<p>dont even look at benchmarks- they are all different!</p>
<p>Lol they must think CPU is all that matters</p>
<p>Sub-scores don&#8217;t really mean much for real-world scenarios. What&#8217;s more important is actual game play performance, so you should be looking at the offscreen versions of the following:<br />
1) Egypt Classic: for mainstream (good quality) 3D games, and last year&#8217;s best games.<br />
2) Egypt HD: for modern and heavy (very high quality) 3D games.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what really matters. Both Exynos 5 and S4 Pro scored best in Egypt HD offscreen, which means they are the best chips for modern, very high quality, gaming&#8230; The scored lower in &#8220;on-screen&#8221; because they&#8217;re both driving higher resolutions than their counterparts. Note that the Nexus 4 should have similar/better scores to LG&#8217;s Optimus G, but the software isn&#8217;t finalized yet.</p>
<p>Exynos 5 and Snapdragn S4 Pro are also very good and compare well to Apple&#8217;s A6 in Egypt Classic (both above 60FPS in offscreen 1080p) which should be more than enough for current/legacy games. But again, they&#8217;re both the best for MODERN vertex shader-intensive gaming and they both support OpenGL ES 3.0 while Apple&#8217;s A6 doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say Adreno 320 and Mali t604 GPUs are better than Apple&#8217;s implementation of PowerVR SGX MP3 in their A6 chip. The A6X chip is a different story though, but still lacks support for OpenGL ES 3.0&#8230;..</p>
<blockquote>the best Android phone on the market right now</blockquote>
<p>Nexus 4: 8.3<br />
Samsung Galaxy S III: 8.5</p>
<p>It is a great review, but i think The Verge&rsquo;s score system is bad.</p>
<p>You need to take the publishing date into account.</p>
<p>So if The Verge had reviewed the G1 and given it a 8.6 you&rsquo;d say it was better than this phone?</p>
<p>No. Review scores are all about context.</p>
<p>are you aware of this concept?: TIME</p>
<p>i think the british invented it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that quoting only half of the sentence is fair here. You left out the important part from that paragraph, which is why the score is less than S3.</p>
<blockquote>It&rsquo;s terrific &mdash; save for one small thing.</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rdquo; is the key word.</p>
<p>Frankly, for me TMobile&rsquo;s HSPA+ is pretty fast. I pay only 60$ for Unlimited Everything (with 2GB throttling limit-which I have never hit). On looking at Anandtech&rsquo;s  speed test on TMobile it showed 22Mbps which is pretty close to your LTE speeds. I will be getting this phone because it&rsquo; s cheap & looks decent. Just wished it a better camera (along the lines of 920 or something) but can&rsquo;t have everything.<br />
This will be my next along with the charging dock.</p>
<p>Josh has to be asked why he tested the phone on a network that only offers HSPA+21 speeds when the phone is capable of HSPA+42.  Its the exact same as docking a tablets WiFi for being slow because you had it connected to an 802.11b router.</p>
<p>Lots and lots of people will use this on AT&T. Reviewing it on HSPA+ 21 makes sense.</p>
<p>But more people won&rsquo;t. See: the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So you would like josh to fly all around the world to test data speeds?</p>
<p>No, it actually makes very little sense.  The ONLY network this is sold on is Tmobile.  He also compared it to AT&T LTE which is barely used at all, so the speeds are astronomically high.  Had he compared it to Verizon, the LTE speeds would be FAR closer.</p>
<p>Also, would you accept a review where he reviewed the screen but never put the brightness above 50%?  Well a lot of people will use the screen under 50%, but its RIDICULOUS to review a piece of hardware and knock it for something you simply didn&rsquo;t test.</p>
<p>While true, it would be nice to see a T-Mobile HSPA+ test since it is the only carrier in the US that is selling it at a subsidized cost.</p>
<p>I want it, but I want 32GB more. Going to have to wait.</p>
<p>This is what happens when google wants you to live in the cloud, and not here on earth.</p>
<p>Apparently it comes with free 50GB of box storage.</p>
<p>With all the driving around Google does, they should realize there&rsquo;s not enough data coverage to live in the cloud.</p>
<p>those guys are just interns, they never factor into google software design decisions.</p>
<p>Eco systems gets a 9, and I agree with that fully. So why does the same ecosystem get a 6 in the Nexus 10 review?</p>
<p>Because Android&rsquo;s Tablet ecosystem is gash compared to its phone offering because nobody takes advantage of the formfactor beyond setting the application width to &lsquo;100%&rsquo;. No font scaling, no space utilisation, just a stretched application.</p>
<p>Because it isn&rsquo;t the same ecosystem, not really. The ecosystem for Android tablet apps is a lot worse than the ecosystem for Android phone apps.</p>
<p>Cool, thanks. I use an Android phone and a iPad tablet, so I guess I have have the best of both worlds&hellip;</p>
<p>because the appps are not optimized to tablets.</p>
<p>Josh you know that the Interface of the Camera is allready on the metro app from OneNote right?</p>
<p>interface = menu style UI thing you love so much</p>
<p>The circular menu system was in the default android browser well before one note had it.</p>
<p>A similar interface has been on the stock browser for the Nexus S for a while, since ICS I believe. You swipe from the side of the phone and the options just open in a semi-circle in the same manner as this camera app.</p>
<p>Is that relevant? It&rsquo;s a great UI paradigm that deserves to be implemented in as many touch scenarios as possible.</p>
<p>do they have it the camera? Noo.</p>
<p>No LTE is a good move. It&rsquo;s just a battery sink at the moment, the few networks that offer it bottleneck it meaning its no better than 3G/HSDPA in the real world and there are issues regarding frequencies.</p>
<p>By the time these issues are resolved, the next phone would be out.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be anymore.</p>
<p>Apple does employ a LOT of compromises to achieve better battery life. A few things that do come into mind are the fact that nothing is downloaded in the background. You get a push notification that you have new email, new update etc. but actual download only happens after you open the app.</p>
<p>iPhone also has the limitation of using only one antenna at any given time whereas android devices (mostly) are able to have multiple antennas working so when LTE is on other antennas are lso on which is not the case in iphone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple does employ a LOT of compromises to achieve better battery life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Irrelevant, the iPhone-5 scored a higher battery life on LTE than on 3G &ndash; same compromises in both cases.</p>
<p>i am able to do background downloading on the iphone. not in safari, but in another app called &lsquo;downloads&rsquo;. and in spotify as well actually.</p>
<p>The problem with that comparison is that energy consumption is highly dependent on signal strength.  If the phone is in a good LTE area but not so good 3g area, the LTE will get better life.  All things being equal, LTE consumes more energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All things being equal, LTE consumes more energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily since there are race-to-sleep effects &ndash; LTE can end up more efficient when you&rsquo;re transferring a fixed amount of data, because it can operate for less time.</p>
<p>If you believe Anandtech&rsquo;s testing is faulty then the onus is on you to find another credible benchmarking site that has different results.</p>
<p>Again, it depends on location.  Here is another site with different results, showing the 5 being less than the 4s in most situations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iphonehacks.com/2012/09/iphone-5-vs-iphone-4s-battery-life.html" target="_blank">http://www.iphonehacks.com/2012/09/iphone-5-vs-iphone-4s-battery-life.html</a></p>
<p>Yes but iLounge (the actual site that did that survey) admitted that their testing was done with low signal strength &#8211; which is daft, testing is ALWAYS done with the best signal strength available.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;if you’re using your iPhone 5 in places a with a very strong (4- to 5-bar) LTE or 3G signal, your cellular battery life may approach that number</em> (ie. Apple&#8217;s stated 8 hours that anandtech saw)  <em>, but if not, the cellular antenna will struggle to maintain a signal, and fall well short. Because LTE and 3G/4G towers are in a state of build-out flux right now, our tests suggest that many LTE users won’t come close to Apple’s promised numbers.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>When measuring in a high signal strength area the iPhone-5 has superior LTE life to 3G.</p>
<p>Oh and the comparison with the 4S?  Completely useless by your own argument because</p>
<p><em>Both numbers were below the just-shy-of-6-hour run times of the AT&amp;T and Verizon iPhone 4S models when they were on 3G/4G networks last year, <strong>though it needs to be said that both iPhone 4Ses had 3G/4G signals in the 3- to 4-bar range.</strong></em> (They had only 2 bars on their iPhone 5 tests!)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-iphone-5-16gb-32gb-64gb/P7" target="_blank">http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-iphone-5-16gb-32gb-64gb/P7</a></p>
<p>The iLounge tests are interesting to show how battery life drops off with signal strength but they&#8217;re completely useless as a comparsion of LTE life against 3G in the iPhone-5 or the iPhone-5 vs iPhone-4S.</p>
<p>Believe me when I say this. If you are constantly battling for a LTE signal at home, work or anywhere else you spend your time, it WILL eat your battery quick.</p>
<p>Who bottlenecks it? Verizon still tests over 20mbit. Just when the speeds start to drop and you start getting into the low teens they end up adding more backhaul.</p>
<p>Seriously, there have only been a couple of month-long periods for me in STL where is hasn&rsquo;t tested that high.</p>
<p>Oh boy. Ohboyohboyohboyohboy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care about LTE in the least, not available in my area for the most part, and that seems to be Josh&rsquo;s biggest concern.</p>
<p>What a device this is.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t live in the USA therefore I don&rsquo;t have 4G LTE. Should the device get a 9 overall score for a person such as me specially that it has international HSPA+?</p>
<p>Which wallpaper is this!?</p>
<p>Wallpaper from <strong>Simon C Page</strong> :)<br /><a href="http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/2012/03/ipad-hd-retina-wallpaper/" target="_blank">http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/2012/03/ipad-hd-retina-wallpaper/</a></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure a review by Vlad would give a review score of 9 since the lack of LTE would have almost zero bearing for someone in a country that barely has it.</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s worth mentioning that here in the UK, we get HSPA+ speeds (not even DC-HSPA+) that are roughly equal to US LTE speeds. So much for LTE being an deal-breaker lol</p>
<p>Give the carrier pricing structures on LTE, what&rsquo;s the point.  So you get data faster.  You also &ldquo;race&rdquo; to 0 GB faster on your data plan.</p>
<p>I assume the glass back was knock on the 4/4s right?  Serious question as I don&rsquo;t remember the reviews</p>
<p>This device does not give me reason to upgrade from my Galaxy Nexus.  Maybe its just me, but Sprint LTE blazes in my market and a few hardware changes aren&rsquo;t reason enough to give up LTE.  CRAZINESS.  On to waiting for Sprint to upgrade to Jelly Bean 4.2&hellip;see you in a year.</p>
<p>Sprint is actually faster at getting upgrades out than Verizon or anyone else seems to be, so it probably won&rsquo;t be that long.</p>

<p>Glass was a terrible idea on the iphone and that also applies here. I do not see how making a more fragile body increases the &ldquo;build quality&rdquo;. Otherwise, good phone, good price, decent review. Thanks for giving us the deets Josh</p>
<p>Totally buying the shit out of this next Tuesday.</p>
<p>You mean next NEXT Tuesday? :/</p>
<p>I want to say something about this whole LTE is only problematic in the US.<br />
I live in Munich, Germany and almost the entire country has LTE coverage, at least from T-Mobile. <br />
Also, with LTE I don&rsquo;t get 10 MBit/s, but between 30 and 40 whereas with 3G I get between 3 to 10 MBit/s.<br />
(All testes on iPhone 5 with Speed Test)<br />
So, not only do we have great LTE coverage across the country, but also higher speeds.</p>
<p>in Stuttgart as well. Didnt tested the speed though. Going to do that next week on the Lumia 920</p>
<p>Well you guys aren&rsquo;t getting fucked as hard by your carriers I imagine, with the general bent towards consumer protection over in your hemisphere.</p>
<p>Just because T-Mobile in the US has almost no share of the market and therefore is presenting itself as a good guy to appeal to customers, this is entirely different in Europe. T-Mobile is one of the biggest european and certainly by far the biggest german carrier. And we get fucked too. But, at least we don&rsquo;t have these ridiculous carrier brandings with a shitload of different phone versions for each carrier. And you can buy your phone unlocked and use it with whatever carrier you want. But almost everyone I know gets their phone on contract, just like you do.</p>
<p>Agreed. Vodafone is the same. Its more expensive and douchey in the UK then it is in other markets.</p>
<p>But yes at least it isn&rsquo;t as bad as the US.</p>
<p>Yes.<br />
And on a positive note, the EU does some things which are pretty great for consumers. For example did they cap the money on text messages and phone calls for connections accross european contries. This absurdly makes, in some cases, calls or text messages between two countries cheaper than within one country.</p>
<p>Yes, my roaming bill went from &pound;10 to &pound;2. Amazing.</p>
<p>Also standardized handsets, frequencies and technologies have lowered pricing by increasing competition.</p>
<p>In the UK we have LTE now but EE the carrier charges ridiculous money to be on it so even if the Nexus 4 had the feature I wouldn&#8217;t be willing to pay the extra cost for another year or so when the prices come down.  By then there will be a new Nexus and it will almost certainly have LTE.</p>
<p>I think Google have made a perfectly timed business decision which has led to an excellent value proposition.</p>
<p>Ah okay. This sucks.</p>
<p>In my case I pay 5€ for LTE on T-Mobile. Additionaly with that option, my data volume (after which the connection speed is capped to GPRS) is doubled. This is okay in my opinion. But as I said, we have quite a good coverage from T-Mobile, Vodafone and O2.<br />
Do you guys in UK and US also have volume caps on your mobile data &#8220;flat rates&#8221;?</p>
<p>I still want one, regardless of LTE. My Gnex isn&rsquo;t even a year old though.. Wonder if I should just hold off until the next Nexus.</p>
<p>Pretty sure this is my next&hellip; didn&rsquo;t like it at first but it&rsquo;s been growing on me. I swore my next phone would be an AT&T handset with LTE, but now I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll just take a Play Store-bought N4 and go to T-Mobile for $30/month.</p>
<blockquote>While testing the phone, I <strong><em>accidentally</em></strong> knocked the device off of my dining table and onto a hardwood floor&hellip; cracking the glass on the back.</blockquote>
<p>Suuure, accidentally. Come on admit it, you just wanted to see if it would crack!</p>
<p>True that, not sure , but Joshua&#8217;s mood was very different when reviewing  the nexus 4 compared to the galaxy nexus</p>
<p>I live in Europe,so this is a great choice for me,right?Also,nice wallpaper!:)</p>
<p>Reception and Call Quality, does that include LTE being missing? If so, that killed the score.</p>
<p>No LTE in this day is ridiculous. No CDMA version sucks. I see and easily understand why they aren&rsquo;t there but makes me wonder why people are going crazy for this Nexus if they are not a developer or someone stuck on T Mobile or from Europe. The only reason I would consider this is if I had some extra cash and wanted an expensive toy.</p>
<p>LTE in Europe (Spain here) is like a scifi movie. Good move for Europe :)</p>
<p>LTE exist in the UK, but no one wants it until the other operators roll put LTE on better bands and lower price.</p>
<p>In Spain too (Movistar aka O2 in UK), but 3G has the best coverture/quality for now.</p>
<p>Exactly! I&rsquo;m happy on 3G and its so darn cheaper. Why bother</p>
<p>3G, best performance without incompatibility with countries. Perhaps LTE in the future, but not now.</p>
<p>No CDMA version is great, standardized handsets create competition.</p>
<p>Because LTE is not needed in most other countries.</p>
<p>Stuck on T-Mobile? I am currently using T-Mobile but I&rsquo;m not stuck on T-Mobile. In my area and where I spend 98% of my life (Home and Work) T-Mobile is the best of the major 4. I constantly get around 20mb/s download speeds, 3mb/s upload speeds and NEVER have dropped calls. I&rsquo;m sure the T-Mobile tower located 300 yards behind my house helps too. Other carriers can&rsquo;t offer me anything more and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to pay more for less. No other carrier gives me free WiFi calling which we need when we go to our time share in St. Martin. WiFi calling also allows us to have a 500 minute shared plan. We make about 60% of our calls over WiFi. So yea, in the end&hellip;..I&rsquo;m not STUCK with T-Mobile. I choose T-Mobile. When they deploy their LTE 10 towers while ATT and Verizon are stuck on LTE 8, it will be even better (as long as your in a LTE area&hellip;which I will be).</p>
<p>Are you still thinking of T-Mobile from 10 years ago? I am currently on AT&amp;T, and I am switching back to T-Mobile as soon as I get my Nexus.  AT&amp;T is expensive and finds every possible way to screw over the customers or the whole internet &#8211; can&#8217;t stand this corporation.</p>
<p>T-Mobile USA = the only GSM carrier left with unlimited data or $30 a month prepaid for 100 minutes/unlimited SMS/5 GBs of data.  They do not have great coverage outside of major cities, but I do not travel often far from metropolitan corridors, so this is not a concern to me. AT&amp;T cost is about 40%-50% a month for the same features.  LTE is nice and all, but I am yet to find someone who uses their phone as a hotspot on a daily basis. Unless you are streaming video or downloading lossless audio over cell networks, there is not pressing need for LTE speeds. Also, if you ARE streaming video and downloading big files on Verizon you will be hitting your data cap even quicker. This isn&#8217;t about the technology, they could have made and LTE version &#8211; but they would have then made various version for every LTE band combinations (US/NA, Europe, Asia).</p>
<p>At $350, this is all about allowing people to have access to a high end Android device without any carrier branding or software limitation bull. Until there is an economic way to make a global unlocked LTE devices, Google will not do it.</p>

<p>There is a very good discussion going on in the android forum that deserves some look at about this LTE thing. I hope some editors will pop in and give some more opinion.</p>
<p>Can someone post an example of how you use your phone and why android improves your live and make it easier. I really don&rsquo;t understand what is so special in Android. I see only cons in it compared to other platforms:<br />
- unconsistend UI<br />
- hard to understand and complex UI<br />
- more clicks to get to information you need<br />
- more clicks to make use cases you need<br />
- in time Android gets laggy as i understand because of Java and it&rsquo;s cons.</p>
<p>Android is becoming more and more consistent<br />
Unless you are an idiot, Android is not complex.<br />
Not really sure what you mean by this.<br />
Again, not sure.<br />
At times, but Project Butter has smoothed a lot of that out,</p>
<p>Lack of handcuffing by Apple and even MS.   The fact that sharing from multiple apps have existed long before Apple even coughed up a twitter/facebook share option is laughable.</p>
<p>Can you post an axample where sharing between apps in Android make our live being better?<br />
Your use case you discovered for yourself.</p>
<p>Post an example?  Every day for me.  Apps can plug into be able to share, and i love that flexibility of being able to share something from the device without opening the separate app up first.</p>
<p>If you like iOS or whatever, its what you like&hellip;.if you want someone to prove why they like something, well thats just being a bit obnoxious.   You came into an Android review and started claiming android isn&rsquo;t good.</p>
<p>Good day sir.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see an example here. Please, describe it like for kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can describe it 7-years old by simple words you don&rsquo;t know it "</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t i &rsquo;ve meant</p>
<p>seriously?<br />
  Ok&hellip;I take a picture with my camera on the phone, i then want to upload it to my picasa album so I can share it with others&hellip;I can just select &ldquo;share&rdquo; then choose &ldquo;picasa&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or hell if i just want it my personal  cloud:  &ldquo;Share&rdquo; then hit &ldquo;skydrive&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hav to wait for Apple to allow applications to plug into its camera app.</p>
<p>Anything else you need from me?</p>
<p>I have an example that happened to my wife the other day.  She wanted to share an article from the Flipboard app to the Pinterest App.  On the iPad, it&rsquo;s not possible.  On her GS3, she would click on the share button on the Flipboard app.  The Flipboard app would then ask Android what other apps on her device are registered to share this type of data and then displays a list of them  She selects the Pinterest app and posts it on Pinterest.</p>
<p>Perhaps go out and actually use an Android phone for yourself? Stock Android is rather straightforward in operation. New apps install to your homescreens, there&rsquo;s a giant button to open the app drawer containing all your apps and widgets, swiping gestures to open the notification drawer are virtually the same as opening the notification drawer in iOS, and if you read the review or watch the video summary, there&rsquo;s now an easier two-finger swipe gesture to open quick settings to toggle wi-fi, etc.</p>
<p>It uses the Java language, but not the Java VM. That is not the reason for lag.</p>
<p>So what is the reason then? I used to know Java universal aproach will allways be slower that native coding in raw hardware.</p>
<p>Well it caches it to /cache like APC in PHP</p>
<p>Garbage collecting can still be a problem</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>- unconsistend UI<br />
     This is no longer true as of ICS and Jellybean, Google (read: Matias Duarte) really nailed down a consistent experience.</p>
<p>- hard to understand and complex UI<br />
     Perhaps compared to the simplicity of iOS and the elegance of WinPho, yes, there&rsquo;s a steeper learning curve. But what you get in exchange is a highly customization and powerful UX.</p>
<p>- more clicks to get to information you need<br />
   This is false &ndash; widgets mean you don&rsquo;t have to launch an app to get info. Combine that with the enhance notifications in Jellybean, and I think it even gives WinPho&rsquo;s live tiles a run for it&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>- in time Android gets laggy as i understand because of Java and it&rsquo;s cons.<br />
    This is untrue. Project Butter solved the vast majority of &ldquo;lag&rdquo; perception.</p>
<p>As to your original question, Google Now is truly a game changer, even in it&rsquo;s infancy. My phone now runs my schedule for me &ndash; I&rsquo;m chronically tardy &ndash; and tells me when I need to leave. That alone is what keeps me from exploring a WinPho device.</p>
<p>Well, thang &ndash; i will explore this future more.</p>
<p>You are wrong on 4 of 5 counts, and the final one is improving (inconsistent UI)</p>
<p>Your talking about android gingerbread, a very old version. This bothers so much when anyone brings up Android, they bring up gingerbread, forgetting that android has progressed leaps and bounds to what it is today. Android jelly bean is as smooth as iOS, and was categorized as difficult. They used to be &#8220;very different&#8221; OS&#8217;s , since one was easier to use, while the other was a bit of trouble. Its no competition, Android has got to the point that its a solid OS,  growing app store, and is simple to use as iOS.</p>
<p><strong>This is my next Nexus</strong> :)<br />
(Nexus One, Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus r8now)</p>
<p>This is my next too &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t had a Nexus since the Nexus One. It will be nice to be back. :)</p>
<p>I think this will be a go for me. $350  for a premium phone with no contract? Win. It may lack LTE, but if you live in Vermont, that&rsquo;s not likely to be a factor until the next Nexus phone is released, if ever.  :*(</p>
<p>A phone with no LTE, non-removable battery, no expandable memory and with a glass back? Interesting how android fanboys will receive this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you how I receive it. I don&rsquo;t see how Josh thinks this is a step up from the Galaxy Nexus. Glass back &ndash; no thank you<br />
Non-removable battery &ndash; no thank you<br />
Is this supposed to be a clone of the iPhone 4s?</p>
<p>Looks like Galaxy s3 will have to be for android and cyano10 &#8211; i really dislike touchwiz</p>
<p>You forget the money. Also, all nexuses have no expandable memory (16GB is a joke, but one i&rsquo;m going to live with). Non-removable battery is a little bit of a negative. LTE does not matter here in the UK.</p>
<p>I agree, and it is a bad joke, they had expandable storage in the nexus one, and then removed it in the next three models&hellip; why take a cool feature away :-(</p>
<p>The non-removable batter is absolutely awful and a complete dealbreaker for me (more so than the lack of LTE, which I think the price compensates for)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never buy a device with non-removable battery. When the battery dies the device dies. Happened to me with my iPod-nano. Never again.</p>
<p>At that price who is keeping this long enough for the battery to no longer hold a charge?  It should last a year or two easy with no degradation.</p>
<blockquote>LG Chem provided a battery that is the first to offer a lifespan of 800 cycles</blockquote>
<p>I love Android but none of this bothers me.</p>
<p>LTE might as well not even exist in the UK. It&rsquo;s only just launched this week, and is priced absolutely ludicrously as one network has a monopoly on it.</p>
<p>99% of people (including me) don&rsquo;t carry around spare batteries.</p>
<p>No expandable memory doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I stream my music and 16gb is plenty for my photos and any pinned music (currently using a Galaxy Nexus).</p>
<p>Glass back isn&rsquo;t a problem. It looks great and I have insurance (why would you have a really expensive phone and no insurance?)</p>
<p>I would definitely get this if I didn&rsquo;t have a year of my contract left.</p>
<p>LTE- Yes, that may be a problem to some.<br />
Non-removable battery- That&#8217;s not a con at all.<br />
No expandable memory- Again, not a con. The cloud is a big part of Google.<br />
Glass back- A minor design complaint.</p>
<p>Frankly, people who are fanboys of removable batteries and expandable storage are insane and I couldn&#8217;t care less how they feel about any device.</p>
<p>Living in Sweden, where LTE hasn&rsquo;t taken over, but instead having 4G, this phone is a super phone with extremely high value. Considering you have many readers outside the U.S. it feels like the final comment should be, this is a stellar phone if you&rsquo;re not dependent on LTE. If you are, you should look at a higher price range. But that doenst make the one any less stellar, at this price point.</p>
<p>It felt like this review was to close to the initial release when Joshua and the rest of the tech blogs in the US are still feeling the blow of suprise. They will change their mind to it later,</p>
<p>IS that Segoe i spy in the blue font?</p>
<p>iPhone 4s: Glass back and no LTE (8.6) <br />
Nexus 4: Glass back and no LTE (8.3)</p>
<blockquote>The mobile industry has changed a lot in the last 12 months. LTE is the norm, not a nice-to-have</blockquote>
<p>LTE is not the norm.</p>
<p>It is for flagship handsets launching in the US.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t a US flagship.</p>
<p>Wow&#8230;you heard it here first, Google&#8217;s flagship nexus device, in the US&#8230;is not a flagship.</p>
<p>There is some truth to the Nexus not being the flagship.</p>
<p>1. It is only $350. Flagship devices like the Galaxy S3 and Note 2 retail for over $500. Flagship devices usually utilize the latest connectivity on respective carriers and are carrier exclusive (HTC One X as an example) &#8211; LTE.</p>
<p>2. The Nexus line has historically been a reference design for developers and end users to try out the latest non-skinned Android software, not make as much money as possible.  (See Nexus 7)</p>
<p>The price means absolutely nothing in terms of whether it&#8217;s a flagship or not. That&#8217;s like saying the nexus 7 isn&#8217;t the flagship android ~7 inch tablet because it&#8217;s sold so cheap. The reason it&#8217;s sold so cheap is because it&#8217;s not sold at a profit. <br />
Find me another HSPDA+ phone that has some of the same specs that the phone has that is being sold at 300 / 350. The same was true w/ the Galaxy Nexus. Google wasn&#8217;t selling them at the low prices because they wanted to make profit on the front end (like all other OEMs have to), they sold them at the low price because they want to make their money off the back end while saturating the market w/ devices and further increasing their market share. Google has very little incentive to make a profit on a front end.</p>
<p>Only in the United States, on Verizon, Sprint (who doesn&#8217;t even have much LTE) and AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Tempting but I think I&rsquo;ll stick with my Galaxy Nexus for the time being, I was hoping for a bigger upgrade. AT&T still doesn&rsquo;t have LTE where I&rsquo;m at so the lack of that certainly doesn&rsquo;t disuade me at all.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, what else could they have added to make this a bigger upgrade? A 1080p screen? The technology really isn&#8217;t there to do a whole lot more hardware-wise.</p>
<p>Good point.  I guess it&#8217;s not really the lack of an upgrade so much as it&#8217;s just not that different.  As Josh said, it looks really similar.  An SD card slot would be really nice.  Actually, if it had an SD card slot I would probably buy it.</p>
<p>I already had to replace the screen on my Galaxy Nexus after I shattered it so I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the glass back.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m finally going to upgrade from my old, tired Nexus One.</p>
<p>Damn you hold it on tight for a while.</p>
<p>Yeah.  Didn&#8217;t much like the Nexus S, and almost bought a Galaxy Nexus but decided to wait a bit longer.  I&#8217;m glad I did.</p>
<p>This is definitely a device I&rsquo;m looking to buy. I&rsquo;m on Verizon but I&rsquo;ll more than likely get a T-Mobile sim to pop in.</p>
<p>I think I am going to switch from my iPhone 5 on AT&T and get the Nexus 4 with the $30 T-Mobile plan.</p>
<p>This is my Next! I hate not having LTE, but that is the price to pay if you don&rsquo;t want to be a contract. Also I hate the headphone jack being on the bottom, so the headphone jack being on the top is a great plus for me</p>
<p>Some sense of entitlement. Apparently the 21 to 42mbit HSPA antennas aren&rsquo;t worth shit anymore.</p>
<p>What is that weather widget?</p>
<p>I want that too!!! What is that?</p>
<p>Pretty sure it&#8217;s the stock widget with JB.</p>
<p>My thought is that the score for reception must be for the audio in that review &#8211; HORRIBLE. Listen with headphones, it was pretty bad. Not what I expect from The Verge. Make sure the mics aren&#8217;t peaking next time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Beautiful Widgets. 4&#215;1 weather widget, hidden background and the simplesolid skin. Though there is a bug where the current (and top) temperature overlaps the big icon.</p>
<p>Also if you do install Beautiful Widgets; when you first launch it it&#8217;ll ask you if you want to send anonymous stats, even if you don&#8217;t allow it the setting is still set to allow. So you&#8217;d want to go to the app from the app drawer, scroll down to Debug tools and untick &#8216;Anonymous stas&#8217;. Developer options in the main settings app may have to be turned on,  but I&#8217;m not too sure.</p>
<p>Beautiful Widgets. A must have app IMO.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t have a year left on my Galaxy Nexus contract I would definitely buy this. The value is incredible, and in the UK there is only EE with it&rsquo;s monopoly on 4G and pitiful data allowances that no-one except the super rich/stupid would actually pay for. It won&rsquo;t be until late 2013 when the competition comes in and makes 4G a viable choice here so until then, HSPA+ will do just fine I think.</p>
<p>I want to buy this device, but a fragile hardware is something I can&rsquo;t pay for&hellip;<br />
It&rsquo;s surprising that t still got 8+&hellip;</p>
<p>Tells you how awesome it is then.</p>
<p>Not that I&rsquo;m party breaker but LTE is available in Europe too!</p>
<p>Not much.</p>
<p>And then you buy an iPhone in Germany and find out it supports only_1_ LTE carrier out of 4 because it lacks bands&#8230;</p>
<p>In very few places for ridiculous and extortionate prices. Even if it exists in a few locations, it&#8217;s still inaccessible.</p>
<p>A shorter review = No LTE make Josh :(</p>
<p>This is a 8.9 in the UK because LTE is ridiculously priced and no one cares.</p>
<p>I agree. This is definitely my next.</p>
<p>Great phone but you forgot to mentioned if Google indeed removed VOIP calling from Jennly bean 4.2. If they did then I&rsquo;ll be sticking to Android 4.1.1 a while longer or until someone hacks it back into 4.2.</p>
<p>Who cares. The sip stack built into Android blows. There is no support for the only two codecs that matter, g729, and speex. CSipSimple is the best SIP client I&rsquo;ve used on any mobile platform, and is constantly updated.</p>
<p>just install csipsimple or anything like that. these apps integrate, you&#8217;ll be using the normal dialer. csip especially has many more options than the rather basic aosp implementation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Verizon customer &ndash; my heart is forever broken.</p>
<p>YEA, I was really looking forward to getting this phone, &ldquo;being a iPhone user&rdquo;, I really hope that Google will reconsider making one for customers like us cause I really want to switch to Android but I want it to be a google phone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a Nexus user almost exclusively, so ibfeel your pain. But the lack of a Verizon model makes my decision to go with the Note 2 much easier. I&#8217;m kinda over the &#8220;pure Android only&#8221; mentality. The S Pen and some of the features in Touchwiz actually enhance Android, IMO.</p>
<p>Your written reviews are always excellent, but your scoring system just sucks.</p>
<p>This is my next.</p>
<p>One question, and one question only:</p>
<p><strong>How did this get the same camera score as the Lumia 920? </strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect an answer.</p>
<p>Camera software, almost certainly. I used the apk that was posted on various Android sites and the UI is <em>fantastic.</em></p>
<blockquote>Camera software, almost certainly.</blockquote>
<p>This, but The Verge would be better off making the basis of their scoring more explicit.</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t this be included in the Software section?</p>
<p>Yes, but since it applies to the camera too it needs to be in the camera section as well.</p>
<p>My guess on why the 920&rsquo;s camera wasn&rsquo;t a 9 or a 10 is that the springs that support the camera and way it is designed make the whole phone larger.</p>
<p>Joshua,</p>
<p>I dont understand why this gets a 6 on reception/call quality. You stated in the article that both of these items were great. If you gave out a score of 6 based on lack of LTE, thats a bit absurd since it&rsquo;s not an featured included, only a desired feature.</p>
<p>I want a phone that makes me coffee, bacon and eggs in the morning, but does that mean I can knock a phone for not having that feature even though it was never advertised with the feature I wanted?</p>
<p>I just want a little consistency. I doubt other non-4G phones were knocked in past reviews for not having 4G, so why start now with the Nexus 4?</p>
<p>AT&T turned on their LTE network last month. Before, many non-LTE phones lacked it because the networks simply weren&rsquo;t capable. But now, three out of the four major networks (in the US, anyway) have LTE available. Now not having LTE is much more of an issue because it&rsquo;s AVAILABLE but the Nexus 4 just can&rsquo;t take advantage of it. You can expect future non-LTE phones to also be dinged quite heavily for it.</p>
<p>This is, of course, purely speaking from the point of view of someone who lives in a major US city with LTE available. Quite a non-issue for many others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now not having LTE is much more of an issue because it&rsquo;s AVAILABLE but the Nexus 4 just can&rsquo;t take advantage of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ok, but the problem is Google made this phone for non LTE markets.  So, in the US, they made this specifically for T-Mobile.  T-Mobile doesn&rsquo;t have LTE so why should points be taken away?  That&rsquo;s like saying that the iPhone should have points taken away because it was an AT&T exclusive a few years back.</p>
<p>A phone made for specific networks shouldn&rsquo;t be docked points because they don&rsquo;t work on all of the networks.</p>
<p>True that, that&#8217;s really strange, on top Joshua is already hating too much for no LTE. Common josh 6 seconds extra of downloading time compared to a S3 isn&#8217;t going to kill anyone.</p>
<p>How did this receive a LOWER score than the GSM Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>Different year, different standards.  The market is much different.</p>
<p>The market is different my ass!! Sprint and AT&amp;T LTE is scarce as fuck, and non-existent on T-Mobile. HIS standards have changed, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Because the scoring system is bollocks.</p>
<p>No, because this lacks LTE and in 2011, LTE was still quite rare, a &lsquo;nice to have&rsquo; feature. Now it&rsquo;s absolutely essential.</p>
<p>To one country.</p>
<p>One really large country.</p>
<p>The country where most of the authors on this site are based in.</p>
<p>Which is minuscule compared to the number of countries the Nexus will be sold in that don&rsquo;t have LTE. You Americans are yet again acting like spoilt brats. I get less than 2mbps downloads on HSPA where i live, because that is all that&rsquo;s offered. Do you see me complaining? Yet Josh is getting 5mbps on a supposedly slow network?! get it into perspective for fuck sake.</p>
<p>If you add up the populations of all the countries the Nexus 4 is available in(Australia, U.K., France, Spain, Canada, Germany), they would be  just less than the United States&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s about 300 million compared to 314 million, not minuscule by any means.</p>
<p>Except, you know, LTE doesn&rsquo;t even cover ALL of the US, and won&rsquo;t for quite some time.  Hell, there are large areas that don&rsquo;t even have HSPA coverage.</p>
<p>LTE penetration drops even more dramatically if you remove Verizon from the equation, this is not and never will be a Verizon phone.  Should it take review  hits as a DEVICE because it&rsquo;s not picked up or pushed to a CARRIER?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it will never go to verizon. The fact is this review is written so that prospective buyers can evaluate which phone to buy, and on which network. Yes it takes a hit if it doesnt operate at the speed consumers are accustomed to.</p>
<p>Lte covers a large portion of the us population. Verizon advertises that it covers over 200m. Not having it is a huge knock. A lot of Americans will be using lte through verizon, at&t, and eventually sprint. And none of us care how slow your internet is alexbifc.</p>
<p>Josh says it himself, if you don&rsquo;t care about lte get this phone. I don&rsquo;t understand why people cant grasp that concept. Stop caring about scores and start enjoying your phone.</p>
<p>competition. Gnex was stacked against what was available back then. This is going head to head with the likes of GS3 or iPhone or Lumia 920. so &hellip;</p>
<p>The LTE Version was an option with the Galaxy Nexus.  You can buy either one.  That&rsquo;s one reason.  LTE was available with the Galaxy Nexus.  The fact that the GSM version was also an option was a bonus, not a negative.  If an LTE version of the Nexus 4 was available, the GSM only version would get a higher score.</p>
<p>Take a not from the AOL way (not The Verge user) and dump scoring.</p>
<p>Scoring is perfectly fine if people realize how and why the scoring is done.  It&rsquo;s a subjective measure on most accounts by an author who is evaluating the product in the market at the time.   The problem with scoring isn&rsquo;t the scores, it&rsquo;s the user base that thinks they can do it better.</p>
<p>So go start your own blog and do it better if you think it&rsquo;s wrong.  Nobody is stopping you.</p>
<p>16 GB is a deal breaker for me. No 3G on by commute, so music streaming music is an impossibility, I&rsquo;d pay &pound;50 for double the storage, but they won&rsquo;t let me.</p>
<p>HTC it is then&hellip;</p>
<p>yeah, I think it is a pretty big oversight to skimp on local storage <strong>AND</strong> uSD</p>
<p>OTG</p>
<p>How is 16GB too small to store enough music for a train ride? Sure, you cannot store your whole collection, but you can sure as hell pin quite a bit with that much space. Google Music also makes it easy to change what items are local.</p>
<p>I think you might be rating it down a little too much just for lacking LTE. No one has a finished LTE network, it wasn&rsquo;t even around a year ago, and I&rsquo;m sure there would be LTE in the nexus 4 if the was any compatibility between carriers, or if Verizon wasn&rsquo;t such a difficult company to work with.</p>
<p>but I understand that its very important for you, and the rest of the verge crew. Thank you for the wonderful review.</p>
<p>This is my next?</p>
<p>while I am still going through the actual write up, I gotta say excellent video review. you pretty much covered and talked about all the aspects of device. Nice job &hellip; thanks.</p>
<blockquote>You can also watch this video on YouTube.</blockquote>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>@Josh: What happened to the sound of the video? There seems to be a lot of popping/distortion?</p>
<p>Holy overblown audio, Batman!</p>
<p>Seriously, was the microphone actually inside Josh&rsquo;s mouth when he recorded the audio for the video review?</p>
<p>For that price, this is a definite winner.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m always surprised when people talking about Photo Sphere don&rsquo;t mention Microsoft&rsquo;s Photosynth, which definitely paved the way for this sort of thing.  I was using Photosynth on my iPhone 4 over a year ago, and sure, it&rsquo;s a third-party app, and sharing the panoramas isn&rsquo;t as easy&hellip;but it&rsquo;s still very similar technology, that I believe is now built into WP8.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; Google&rsquo;s implementation still seems to be better, if only because it makes the technology accessible to that many more people, and the demos seem smoother than I remember Photosynth being &ndash; but I still think Photosynth is worth a nod.</p>
<p>This.  Exactly this.  It seems odd that they wouldn&rsquo;t throw a nod to the fact that this feature was the frankly, great Photosynth app on iOS first.  I believe it was then ported to Android and finally WP7.5 (which is really an indictment of what MS thought of coding for WP7.x when it was the last platform to get their own app.).  I agree that sharing was a bit wonky in that you could only view them with the app or on a MS website.  But it is still a damn cool app.</p>
<p>Most probably don&rsquo;t mention it because no one really knows or cares about it. I never even heard of Photosynth until the Nexus 4 was revealed. Also, I don&rsquo;t think Photosynth was the first application of its kind.</p>
<p>It may not have been the first application of it&#8217;s kinda, but it&#8217;s certainly been around a hell of a lot longer. <br />
<blockquote>Microsoft released a free tech preview version on November 9, 2006. Users could view models generated by Microsoft or the BBC, but not create their own models at that time. Microsoft teamed up with NASA on August 6, 2007 allowing users to preview its Photosynth technology showing the Space Shuttle Endeavour. On August 20, 2007, a preview showing the tiles of Endeavour during the backflip process was made available for viewing.<br />
On August 20, 2008, Microsoft officially released Photosynth to the public, allowing users to upload their images and generate their own Photosynth models.</blockquote></p>
<p>Why does it have to be mentioned? Do we have to go through every piece of technology that led up to us having Photo Sphere?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be <em>very</em> honest about this point: the Nexus 4 isn&rsquo;t a network generation behind. LTE is a building block towards true 4G; it&rsquo;s only 3.9G. It&rsquo;s unfinished technology, pushed out by marketers in need of the &ldquo;new big fast omg thing&rdquo; that&rsquo;s going to sell. And current cheap LTE tech is a battery hog like none other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather have dual-cell HSPA+ [theoratical limit: 42mbit/5.ish MBytes a second] than something that&rsquo;ll kill my battery so I can deplete my databucket in eight hours instead of twenty [theoratical].</p>
<p>Modern LTE chipsets are not the battery hogs they were a year ago and people like you always have the option to turn off LTE if battery life is such a concern.  The rest of us would rather have the option to use the fastest wireless data networks in the world.</p>
<p>As they&rsquo;re deployed, they&rsquo;re not even the fastest. Also, what happens when the LTE signal/spectrum is overused from tower to tower, while the HSPA+DC is unoccupied? I don&rsquo;t think LTE would manage to keep up.</p>
<p>Also, did you pick up my &ldquo;current cheap LTE tech&rdquo; reference? Sourcing a latest-tech LTE radio would have cost probably north of 175$ for the part only, so basically 250$ more on the street price of the phone. Google wants Nexus in as many hands as possible, and had to make a choice between going with HSPA+DC and blanket-cover most of the world with a pentaband radio (PCS/AWS/Eurozone) for cheap, or add support for speed demons on a limited number of markets, spiking the price because speed. I believe they made the right choice.</p>
<p>What do you mean they&rsquo;re not the fastest?  I&rsquo;ve gotten actual speeds of 50 Mbps down on my LTE Galaxy Nexus.  That speed isn&rsquo;t even theoretically possible on any HSPA+ network in the U.S.  I realize adding LTE would significantly increase the cost of the phone and that Google wants to make it cheap enough to compete with subsidized pricing, that&rsquo;s fine they can sell the HSPS+ version to meet that market need.  But they should offer a more expensive LTE version along side it.  You act like they had to choose to make an LTE version or an HSPA+ version but why couldn&rsquo;t they have offered both?</p>
<p>Had they offered both, they would have had to support multiple versions of the hardware, and the Galaxy Nexus had that approach, for regional versions [Canada&rsquo;s version is different from the USA version, NTT Docomo too, etc.]&hellip; And having different versions made it go all to hell. Right now they&rsquo;re concentrating on <em>one</em> revision of the hardware only, and that makes way more sense.</p>
<p>Also, to clarify my statement that LTE isn&rsquo;t the fastest, here in Canada the deployments are haphazard, slow, uneven and extremely unstable. It doesn&rsquo;t really sell me on the LTE idea. But my carrier does dual-cell HSPA+, so I needn&rsquo;t LTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;omgwtf&rdquo; speeds, I get near as good.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fine with the glass back, just need more info on the cases for the Nexus 4!</p>
<p>One question &ndash; if you break the back of this phone, how easy will it be to replace? Apple offers $29 replacements for iPhone 4/4S backs at the Apple Store. These can be had within a day (make a reservation, go to the store, get it replaced quickly)</p>
<p>$349 unlocked device that has an S4 Pro and vanilla Android 4.2. Count me in!</p>
<p>I might upgrade my Galaxy Nexus to this, but I can&rsquo;t.  I&rsquo;m locked into Verizon and I really do love their LTE.</p>
<p>Can Android 4.2 group text back and forth, on my GNEX it looks just like a normal message, but I reply to the group not knowing it? Can Android 4.2 receive iphone screen shots unlike the htc one x? Was pinch to zoom in email added? Do apps still reload? Chrome?</p>
<blockquote>Was pinch to zoom in email added?</blockquote>
<p>Yes, in the Gmail app.</p>
<p>Bit disappointed with the display impressions. Won&rsquo;t stop me from getting this but I was hoping this would be on par with the display on the One X. Sounds like it&rsquo;s just a notch below.</p>
<p>Same here&hellip;I have a One X at the moment an am thinking to switch to a N4 (S4 Pro and Nexus experience are the main reasons). But a downgrade in display quality&hellip;too bad :(</p>
<p>No LTE is a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>So what do you guys think&hellip;.trade a One X for a N4? Still not sure&hellip;<br />
I can get a new phone from my provider (took them too long to repair my One X, so they are giving me a new phone). I can get whatever I want&hellip;get the most &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; one, sell it, get an unlocked N4? Or stick with the One X. SO DIFFICULT :/</p>
<p>Get an iPhone 5 16Gb white and sell that shit on ebay. They&rsquo;re going for like 850-900US. Take the change and buy yourself a Nexus 4 and Nexus 7  ;)</p>
<p>after watching the video review:</p>
<p>has Josh never heard of Microsoft Photosynth? it works pretty much exactly the same way as that new panorama mode and it&rsquo;s been around for 2 years on iOS now.</p>
<p>Three UK is rolling out DC-HSPA+ (42mbps) as I type. LTE coming in time for the next Nexus. This&rsquo;ll do for now.</p>
<p>In our country, even standard HSPA+ is equal to or better than US LTE networks in terms of average real-world speeds, so it&rsquo;s not the loss that JT makes it out to be over here. And as you said, DC-HSPA+ will just double that.</p>
<p>The key word here is backhaul. Judging by the review, backhaul to HSPA+ cell towers in the US is so poor that he could only pull down 5Mbit, whereas 12-15Mbit is perfectly possible on Three.</p>
<p>if only it weren&rsquo;t made by LG.</p>
<p>sigh&hellip;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t your Daddy&rsquo;s LG though&hellip;</p>
<p>Nexus 4 + $30/month prepaid T-Mobile or $45/month Straight Talk (AT&T/T-Mobile MVNO) > LTE.</p>
<p>This is the case for me and, I&rsquo;d wager, a LOT of other potential users.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely the case for me. I am sick of paying stupid amounts of money a month for a single plan on AT&T. I will be ditching my iPhone 5 and going with the Nexus 4 on T-Mobile; and will just use the iPad Mini for my Apple needs. Mobile bills in the U.S. are just outrageous.</p>
<p>Straight Talk is a Walmat scam! Their TOS forbid any music/video streaming and have an arbitrary datacap. They will kill your number if they catch you.</p>
<p>T-mo plan is cool though, but I&rsquo;m not going near that ST scam.</p>
<p>Plenty of people use Straight Talk without issue.  Yes, they can throttle you and terminate service but the lowest threshold is 2 gb/month.  Perfect for lite to moderate data users.  However, others use far more data than that and have been left alone.  It seems to be market-dependent.</p>
<p>The TOS is just meant to discourage people from abusing the data network.  Streaming media isn&rsquo;t restricted as long as you don&rsquo;t do it too much.</p>
<p>The TOS, and company representatives have specifically said that it includes unlimited <strong>web</strong>, no streaming is allowed. &ldquo;You can watch Youtube, on wifi&rdquo; is the official line. The 2GB limit is also not explicitly stated anywhere. I use my phone for business so this kind of shit is not something I want to deal with. Traveling for a week and getting my account closed the 2nd day, with no recourse, is not acceptable</p>
<p>Just saying I&rsquo;ve been on ST for a few months now. In September I tethered the entire month (I was moving, didn&rsquo;t have internet up at the new place). Used ~2 gigs of data, of normal laptop usage&mdash;including Netflix, Youtube, etc. No problems.</p>
<p>Been on ST AT&T for 2 months now.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think before going to ST, you need to evaluate your data use.</p>
<p>I will say that I&rsquo;ve curbed my streaming down. Most of the time, I&rsquo;m at work and can&rsquo;t enjoy such services anyway. And when I&rsquo;m at home, I&rsquo;m on wifi. I only update apps and download music when on wifi. I&rsquo;d rather save my data for other things. That way, I know if I &lsquo;need&rsquo; to download something, I&rsquo;m within the range.</p>
<p>ST is not for everyone for sure but for a lot of people, it is just fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powerusers&rdquo; should be wary.</p>
<p>Fortunately I&rsquo;m one of those lucky T-Mobile customer and they&rsquo;re just finishing their 1900Mhz re-farm here in Kansas City, signal and speeds are great.  Will be ordering this phone.</p>
<p>A very fair review. Wish Josh would have tested on T-Mobile as well though. AT&T just sucks. Hspa+ is soooo slow on their network. T-Mobile is much better and faster. I am buying a nexus 4. I&rsquo;m switching to T-Mobile or simple mobile to. The phone is amazing. The design had grown on me. November 13th couldn&rsquo;t come sooner. :-)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care for LTE much anymore. This will be my next. Looks like a great phone.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of glad that I&rsquo;m not in the market for a new phone right now &ndash; I would have a tough decision on my hands. In terms of Android, I would have put the Note II in the top spot prior to the Nexus 4 &ndash; I was hoping LG would pull it out of the bag, and it looks as though they have. And that price is just so low &ndash; shame then that I suspect any carrier putting it out on a contract will price it like a device costing twice as much.<br />
As for the lack of LTE, I have to admit that it doesn&rsquo;t concern me. Living in the UK, I would prefer to see 3g/HSDPA get better coverage &ndash; much like with processors and RAM, the more specs you give to developers, the more they seem to want to hog it (even twitter feed updates are playing up on GPRS/EDGE these days).</p>
<p>Josh why do I get the feeling that you knew what you were going to say before you wrote the review. Looking at the phones history we all know that its a Google phone. It started as a dev phone.  Refine to me means that there was more detail put into the exterior of the phone. And they did that. The design on the back is something new that we have not really seen on a phone before.</p>
<p>Ill keep reading and hope the review gets a bit more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Josh, since I feel like I was in the same boat as you for a while&hellip; waiting to see what the next Nexus would be before upgrading to a new phone, I have to wonder what your next phone is going to be now. Galaxy SIII?</p>
<p>Me too. I don&rsquo;t want shitty skins so that means no S3 or One X, and I have to stick with my GNex. IF next years nexus is equally mediocre I have a problem..</p>
<p>Gorgeous photos of the device. Looking for an alternative to iPhone and I think this is it.</p>
<p>I can live without LTE for another year&hellip; Long live FauxG/HSPA+</p>
<p>I think many DC-HSPA+ users only see the download speeds and say &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t need that throughput my DC-HSPA+ is fast enough!&rdquo;.  Probably the biggest advantage of LTE when using your mobile is the dramatic reduction in latency not just max throughput speed.  The latency is what gives LTE that immediate fast data feeling over HSPA+.</p>
<p>But I can understand why Google didn&rsquo;t offer the Nexus with LTE .  You couldn&rsquo;t possible come up with a single SKU that could serve the whole world with LTE.  To offer LTE would mean offering up several different SKUs.  Then they would lose their economy of scale and it would be darned tough to hit their $299/399 price points.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/X7Miq.png" /><br /><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4FiRa.jpg" /></p>
<p>Because 37ms is just so damn slow.</p>
<p>Where do you live?</p>
<p>Obviously, in the little shack that&rsquo;s at the base of T-Mobile cell towers&hellip;those are crazy speeds man! LTE FTL.</p>
<p>These were taken in NYC by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/users/milan03" target="new">milan03</a> using an iPhone on the HSPA+ 21Mbps 1900Mhz band (originally posted in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3577198/nexus-4-t-mobile-usa" target="new">this thread</a>)</p>
<p>Yeah because being one of maybe a hand full of people on the 1900mhz refarmed spectrum is any indication of 99.9% of people&rsquo;s performance on ATT/T-mobile.  Where is the rolling eye smiley face when you need one?</p>
<p>Under similar loads LTE will beat the pants off of HSPA+ with respect to latency.  That&rsquo;s not my opinion.  Tha&rsquo;ts not your opinion.  That&rsquo;s just the laws of physics as we know it.</p>
<p>So LTE gets 30ms of ping in the same exact spot my DC-HSPA 42 handset gets 37ms of ping.</p>
<p>OMG WTF AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE</p>
<p>I love these posts because when T-Mobile skips LTE and goes straight for LTE Advanced in a couple months, everyone is going to be praising their network all of  sudden (or grinding their teeth w/ envy from their overpriced and then slow other 3 networks) shit&#8217;s going to flip then you guys will be saying &#8220;who needs that much speed&#8221;</p>
<p>But I think the guys back in Germany (more precisely, the Deutsche Telekom headquarters) should tell T-Mobile USA to stop calling their HSPA+ network &ldquo;4G&rdquo;.</p>
<p>errr&hellip; $299/349 price points :)  Dang lack of edit!</p>
<p>This is my next! This is my next! This is sooo MY NEXT!!!</p>
<p>&hellip;oh and did I mention? THIS IS MY NEXT!  =)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to speak into my good ear. ;)</p>
<p>I fear these will sell out in minutes. F5&rsquo;in on release day!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re european, you can wipe the LTE con, and add a half-point to the final score.</p>
<p>Josh, how does the video captured compare to the Galaxy Nexus? I know the camera is a big upgrade in terms of photos, but what about video? Thanks. Definitely my next anyway :)</p>
<p>bummer about LTE tho.</p>
<p>btw anyone know what weather widget is that?</p>
<p>10 on performance and software. That must mean something. :)</p>
<p>If you have any respect for yourself you&rsquo;ll just skim over this review and wait for more serious reviews and user feedback to come. As usual both the Verge and Engadget rush into publishing reviews first but without really living with a device. The real issues only become apparent after weeks of use and not in a couple of days.</p>
<p>Same situation was with the Galaxy Nexus. Most sites, including the Verge and Engadget said it was the best smartphone yet, and no one had really commented on the terrible screen colors and yellow tint: <a href="http://goo.gl/iKOwb">http://goo.gl/iKOwb</a></p>
<p>If Josh hadn&rsquo;t dropped it and broke the back he would probably say that the glass held up pretty well. Wait for other real reviews before taking the plunge.</p>
<p>Since I am on T-Mobile and get fast speeds, the LTE issue is moot.</p>
<p>My country has no LTE networks, so Google, please, take my money already!</p>
<p>Can someone explain the big concern of lack of LTE for anyone not on Verizon (and maybe Sprint)?  I was under the impression that Verizon&rsquo;s the only one with true LTE and everyone else is using HSPA+ and calling it LTE???</p>
<blockquote>Although marketed as a 4G wireless service, LTE as specified in the 3GPP Release 8 and 9 document series does not satisfy the technical requirements the 3GPP consortium has adopted for its new standard generation, and which were originally set forth by the ITU-R organization in its IMT-Advanced specification. However due to marketing pressures and the significant advancements that WIMAX, HSPA+ and LTE bring to the original 3G technologies, ITU later decided that LTE together with the aforementioned technologies can be called 4G technologies.</blockquote>
<p>Per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)</a></p>
<p>Lack of LTE doesn&rsquo;t concern me. I live in Southeast Asia where LTE is almost non-existent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the plus side, call quality and reception was excellent on the phone. "<br />
Reception / Call Quality: 6.<br />
I don&rsquo;t usually comment on the score breakdown, but that looks like a pretty obvious error. If it&rsquo;s not, I would love it if you updated the review explaining what is wrong with reception / call quality, since that&rsquo;s kind of an important detail ;)</p>
<p>The best overall phone of this year. Good.</p>
<p>In the review you mention that the call quality and clarity are very good and yet in the graph you have rated reception/call quality as a mere 7.  Is that 7 because of the lack of LTE? Assume that I am not using data and just talking to someone, how would you rate the clarity of call then?</p>
<p>Typo. I meant 6, not 7 (reception/call quality score). That score almost makes me not get the phone. Please elaborate why you rated that as a 6.</p>
<p>The reason it got a 6 is not actually because of reception or call quality, but because there is no LTE. If you&rsquo;re not worried about LTE, then get this phone.</p>
<p>In that case, they better add a new score category: Data Speeds<br />
Reception/Call Quality is in no way related to a device having LTE or not (unless you are using Viber or likes to make calls). <br />
@Joshua,  please justify the score or correct the review text and/or the score.</p>
<p>I will add: <strong>This phone does indeed deserve an overall higher score than the 920 in my opinion. </strong></p>
<p>I was hesitating between S3 or that I will go with that I think but I am a bit worried about the glittery back but if it&rsquo;s too glittery I will get a case anyways I have a tendency to drop my phone.</p>
<p>Wait, so from what I can tell, this didn&rsquo;t get an overall score in the 8 range, and got docked for reception and call quality,  purely due to lack of LTE? The score labeled Reception/Call Quality was low, despite him saying in the review that both were excellent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are little details like this all over Android 4.2. For instance, there&rsquo;s a new menu in your call log that lets you sort calls by type (missed, voicemail, outgoing, etc.) &mdash; a small tweak, but one which I found incredibly helpful. Google has also added an easier way to use an Emoji keyboard &mdash; if you want to do something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hahahhaha did people use cellphones before so called smartphones? Every &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; phone had this feature before and now suddenly &ldquo;it&rsquo;s fine little detail&rdquo;. Smartphones miss so many little thing from &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; phones that it&rsquo;s not even right to call the that smart.</p>
<p>As many comments to follow will likely note, can you have some consistency in the reviews? I&rsquo;m an Android user, but looking over the photos here, it&rsquo;s CLEAR that the 920 (and iPhone 5, and S III, and One X, and 8X) all have a significantly better camera than the Nexus 4. Yet you give it an 8? Come ON.</p>
<p>Totally agree</p>
<p>All your LTE snobs can just buy some phone with that battery-destroying radio and shut up already. In fact, you should all switch to LTE so there&rsquo;ll be  faster HSPA+ for me! I can use all that money I will have saved and go on vacation! Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll send you PhotoSpheres of Machu Picchu?</p>
<p>LMAO.</p>
<p>1. My LTE plan costs me the same as my old HSPA+ plan on Tmo<br />
2. Subsidized Galaxy S3 with LTE cheaper than Nexus 4<br />
3. &lsquo;Battery destroying&rsquo; = nope</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m LMAO at you<br />
1. I haven&rsquo;t seen any LTE plan that beats T-Mobile&rsquo;s variety of HSPA+ options in terms of price.<br />
2. You do realize you&rsquo;re paying more over two years with that subsidized S3.<br />
3. &ldquo;Battery destroying&rdquo; = nope, Drains battery faster than HSPA+, yep.  A lot faster actually.</p>
<p>LTE usage supports a lower battery drain.  Just so you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glass backing breaks easily&rdquo; as a negative? Although, I&rsquo;ll agree that it is a negative, I don&rsquo;t seem to recall Josh mentioning it in his iPhone 4/4s review.</p>
<p>Will all Nexus 4 variants have their updates handled directly by Google or will LG be supporting the phones not bought directly through Google&rsquo;s Play Store?</p>
<p>Google pushes the updates to the Nexus line.  This was even the case with the Verizon Galaxy Nexus, but Verizon had to sign-off on OTA&rsquo;s first.</p>
<p>Then why did it take 2 &ndash; 4 months for even minor bug fixes to be pushed to unlocked and unsubsidised GSM Galaxy Nexus devices in Europe and elsewhere outside the US? Why did Samsung claim to have to do &ldquo;quality assurance testing&rdquo; for every update?</p>
<p>If Google handles all updates for Nexus devices directly and the only exception is one carrier in the US then what I have described above can&rsquo;t be true but it is true and widely documented even though Google of course, in true Google fashion, hasn&rsquo;t officially commented at all.</p>
<p>The Nexus brand guarantees nothing in terms of updates, which is why I&rsquo;m wondering what Google&rsquo;s plans are for this latest product.</p>
<p>Actually if you remember, samsung also controlled updates as well. Just because you had a gsm galaxy nexus does not mean it was directly controlled by google.</p>
<p>We might be getting hung up on semantics here.  Yes, Google works with the oem on software updates because, well, they&rsquo;re the oem!  But the actual OTA push comes from Google.</p>
<p>nope, please look into the yakuju differnt version problems, a lot of countries receive galaxy nexus where Samsung was the one doing the OTA, and they delayed the updates a lot.</p>
<p>I just used Verizon as an example.  They&rsquo;re not the only carrier that has to sign-off on an OTA before Google pushes one out.  Basically, if you purchase your phone through a carrier (subsidized or unsubsidised), they&rsquo;re going to have a say in update rollouts.</p>
<p>T-Mobile in the U.S. may be an exception depending on what kind of deal they worked out with Google &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not like the details are made public.  The 100% safe bet for zero carrier intrusion is buying directly from Google.  They&rsquo;ve made the value proposition for that extremely high with a starting price of $299.99.</p>
<p>No. I&rsquo;m not talking about buying anything other than service from a carrier. The carriers have nothing to do with the phone purchase, they are completely separate to the whole problem. I&rsquo;m talking about buying a phone, just like one does with a laptop or a tablet, from a regular independent electronics retailer. I don&rsquo;t know if those still exist in the US but in the rest of the world they do. When one tried to buy a Galaxy Nexus, one without any involvement from a carrier, odds were you&rsquo;d get a phone to which Samsung controlled updates not Google. There was no way to tell before purchase of course, all the boxes and all the ad copy is the same, but the phone would run <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3300936/where-are-the-galaxy-nexuses-yakju-and-where-are-they-yakjuxw">a different firmware build</a>. Because Google had outsourced the software updates to the OEM.</p>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s difficult to do if you&rsquo;re American but, please, try to forget the carriers. This isn&rsquo;t about them. At all. They have nothing to do with the phone.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>In many large markets (notability the EU) the phone market and operator market have been separated into two markets via effective regulation. One does not affect the other.</p>
<p>Fair enough.  But the Nexus line being what it is supports factory unlocking the device out of the box.  Then a quick trip to the &ldquo;Factory Images for Nexus Devices&rdquo; page will allow you to flash the &ldquo;takju&rdquo; build.</p>
<p>Then, you will receive OTA&rsquo;s from Google just like the device sold through the Play Store.  That this sort of thing is explicitly permitted is part of the beauty of the Nexus line and helps to set it apart.</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#takju" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#takju</a></p>
<p>I think you should actually flash a &ldquo;yakju&rdquo; image (The &ldquo;takju&rdquo; image is for the US GNex with Google Wallet).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that Samsung is of the opinion that doing so breaks the warranty and if there is a hardware fault with the device it&#8217;s not as if there&#8217;s a way to actually contact Google. More importantly, isn&#8217;t part of the point of getting a Nexus phone not having to manually flash builds in order to get updates? When you buy a phone that is supposed to get the latest updates directly from Google without interference you should expect to get just that.</p>
<p>Either way, I&#8217;ve stopped expecting Google to do what&#8217;s right, now I just hope that they&#8217;ll be up front about what it is they are doing. Thus my question: how has Google set up the updates for the Nexus 4.</p>
<blockquote>It’s unfortunate that Samsung is of the opinion that doing so breaks the warranty</blockquote> 
<p>Wrong, flashing it to the standard yakuju doesn&#8217;t break warranty, it is just a pain in the ass that we have to do it :-/</p>
<p>So far, there are no other variants of Nexus 4 and Google handles all the future updates.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to get 4G/LTE where I live in the UK until AT LEAST this time next year so a lack of LTE in this phone is not a problem for me, and no doubt the many others who live in the UK.</p>
<p>By the time I can get it, the next Nexus will be out. Yay.</p>
<p>Even though I am buying the Nexus 4, I still love my Galaxy Nexus. It&rsquo;s a magic device and when booted and rooted makes for a cracking little multitool for on the go development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the back of the phone there&rsquo;s a small slit which houses a speaker, and a camera and lens somewhat awkwardly placed towards the upper-left side of the backplate &mdash; I prefer the centered placement of the Galaxy Nexus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Has this not been an issue with the iPhone??</p>
<p>No, because that&rsquo;s made by Apple.</p>
<p>Remember to adjust the score by 10% for being a non-Apple device.  9.1 is outstanding.</p>
<p>Agree that the glass back is ridiculous, and lack of LTE is a problem for some people, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>I really like the phone, wold use it def, and  i like the verge very much too but joshua giving andoid so much hype it&rsquo;s starting to get annoying, specially cause&rsquo; he bashes all the windows phone devices, he needs to be more neutral, i still can belive the time he said &ldquo;i wish the lumia&rsquo;s had android&rdquo; that was like, WTF !!!</p>
<p>If Windows Phone can&#8217;t compete and is inferior, why should he recommend it? If he gives the iPhone a good rating and is considering it as his next and says Android is great, he&#8217;s clearly not being an Apple or Android fanboy and Windows Phone just can&#8217;t compete with the other two. It&#8217;s still not ready, would be a fair conclusion, based on the data at hand.</p>
<p>I love how everyone&rsquo;s pumping out reviews of this device when the software isn&rsquo;t even final and they haven&rsquo;t lived with it for a couple weeks. &ldquo;Me first, me first!&rdquo; <strong>rolls eyes</strong></p>
<p>I also have to be suspicious when the shots of the reviewer&rsquo;s email show a bunch of messages from Apple. 1</p>
<p>All of the sites that reviewed the Nexus Q were guilty of this as well.  They knew that it was pre-release software that they were reviewing but justified it to themselves and there readers by basically saying: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not going to change much before release.&rdquo;  Of course, the device still hasn&rsquo;t made it to market and will be radically different in software when/if it does.  They, apparently, didn&rsquo;t learn their lesson.</p>
<p>In the case of the Nexus 4, the pre-release software doesn&rsquo;t include widgets on the lock screen.  Notice that Josh made nary a mention that the feature will be included in the shipping version of the software.</p>
<p>LTE means so little here in the UK that the lack of it doesn&rsquo;t bother me in the slightest. This is most definitely my next.</p>
<p>Anyone giving any android phone a performance score of 10 is absolutely nuts. Android, although making strides, still is not as smooth as iOS or any iteration of Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Josh consistently writes some of the worst reviews on this site. No matter what device, OS, whatever. Maybe I just think all of his criticisms are nitpicking and would not factor into anyones purchase of a device ie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Camera and lens somewhat awkwardly placed towards the upper-left side of the backplate &mdash; I prefer the centered placement of the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like this is going to make a difference to anyone&hellip;.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re wrong.  Re: Android performance.</p>
<blockquote>Android, although making strides, still is not as smooth as iOS or any iteration of Windows Phone.</blockquote>
<p>What exactly do you mean? Nexus 4 can never be smooth because it runs Android?</p>
<p>Because if this is what you mean, it&rsquo;s safe to say your opinion isn&rsquo;t worth caring about.</p>
<p>No, I said Android isn&rsquo;t as smooth as WP or iOS and thus a 10 is an inappropriate score unless those OS&rsquo;s are getting higher #&rsquo;s than that.</p>
<p>Additionally, and as many other commenters have pointed out, every other review is showing that this specific phone has some serious unexplained performance issues. While this may get fixed in a software update,. it currently makes Josh&rsquo;s review and the arbitrary #&rsquo;s he assigned look even more ridiculous at best, fanboyism at worst.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t care about my opinion though since it counteracts your world view so I&rsquo;ll just fuck off, thanks.</p>
<blockquote>No, I said Android isn’t as smooth as WP or iOS and thus a 10 is an inappropriate score</blockquote>
<p>What version of Android? You mean the one you&#8217;ve never tried?</p>
<blockquote>Like this is going to make a difference to anyone….</blockquote>
<p>It does. The camera in the centre means you can hold it much easier.</p>
<p>Actually it is the other way around, having the camera in the middle makes the standard way you hold your phone in portrait cover the lenses a bit with your middle finger. I have already had problems with that, and I&#8217;m glad they finally move it so it don&#8217;t happen anymore</p>
<p>I care not about LTE. Don&rsquo;t need the battery drain or even the speed. I can stream Netflix HD with zero issues on HSPA+ (AT&T or T-Mobile &ndash; yes I have both). My recommendation is that everyone please go get an LTE phone so us HSPA+ users&rsquo; speeds increase. Thank you. I&rsquo;m going to add this to my Note 2 for a portable option. Yeah, I&rsquo;m getting both. Deal.</p>
<p>Your Note 2 will have better battery life than the Nexus 4, and it has LTE.</p>
<p>and a microSD slot, a wacom digitizer and S-Pen, a vibrant non-pentile amoled display,  swap-able batter, non-glass back, and a physical home button.</p>
<p>What it won&#8217;t have is on-time updates, IPS screen, and the slick, clean, button-less interface.</p>
<p>Shut up and take mine STUPIDLY LOW $299 for this!</p>
<p>The review I&rsquo;ve been waiting for and was not disappointed. I <strong>need </strong>my Nexus 4 now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the plus side, call quality and reception was excellent on the phone. I only had one dropped called while testing, and general sound and clarity was top notch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Call quality: 6</p>
<p>wat</p>
<p>Call quality/RECEPTION</p>
<p>He was getting terrible data speeds on the device.</p>
<p>Obviously. When AT&amp;T is trying to sell LTE to the masses, they can&#8217;t cannibalize their sales with a competing HSPA+42 connection like the one T-Mobile has.</p>
<p>So the camera is just as good as the one on the Lumia 920. Both got 8 for the camera.</p>
<p>I find it ironic that now Apple fans are viewing lack of LTE on a smartphone as a huge downfall.</p>
<p>Yep. I guess if you download .iso&rsquo;s daily it matters, but for on-phone use, it is not a cause for concern at all. I&rsquo;ll take better battery life and 8 mbps average any day. Latency, etc, yes, but HSPA+ is perfectly fine and will speed up as more people get LTE. The future is bright.</p>
<p>IMO the apparent lack of a Verizon model is a much bigger downfall. I have to use VZW for work and I have a Galaxy Nexus now. What&rsquo;s my upgrade path? I guess I&rsquo;m just screwed. I refuse to buy a non-Nexus Android device because I&rsquo;ve had nothing but trouble with them in the past. So I will pretty much be forced to get an iPhone or perhaps Windows Phone now. VZW isn&rsquo;t exactly a small player in the US. Google is leaving a lot of folks behind here.</p>
<p>maybe you just need to stay with the same phone for 2 years&#8230; crazy idea in today&#8217;s world ;)</p>
<p>It strikes me that you got the Lumia 920 and Nexus 4 scores the wrong way around!?  Plus, LTE is a lower battery drain if you are constantly on the network.</p>
<p>Good review &ndash; very fair and balanced.  Praise where it deserves it (GMail scaling is the most exciting thing for me &ndash; I know, crazy) and scorn where it deserves it (LTE).</p>
<p>But overall, for this price point, I want to try it out on T-Mo with a prepaid plan.</p>
<p>Como chingas con el LTE, wey! D:</p>
<p>the arguments about the n4 not having LTE can almost be the same as the iPad mini not having a pixel dense display and yet it gets a nine.</p>
<p>maybe the Verge is so upset because they actually care.</p>
<p>hopefully Google will make a LTE n4 after all the noise that&rsquo;s being made</p>
<p>p.s. I&rsquo;m on straight talk so the n4 is definitely my next!</p>
<p>i don&rsquo;t understand, when you review the galaxy nexus you reviewed the hspa+ unlocked version, then you reviewed the carrier version. now you reviewed the unlocked version and you complain about the lack of LTE which right now it doesn&rsquo;t exist in any unlocked phone and if it has, it will be very expensive. i think the one that should be criticized is T-mobile , not having LTE until now. and be sure the LTE version will come soon if other carrier will have it.</p>
<p>In a country where LTE does not exist (well, the world, except &ldquo;god blessed&rdquo; USA), this is a 9.9 device I guess. :)</p>
<p>Oooh and don&rsquo;t you have Wifi in USA? You know, it&rsquo;s kinda fast. You should try!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Was considering this but I think I&rsquo;ll wait for the HTC 5"</p>
<p>I wanted a Nexus bad too. Where is the multi-device &ldquo;withGoogle&rdquo;  options?!?!</p>
<p>Yeah, here in Austria LTE is not quite ready yet but we have HSPA everywhere with great reception. No Problems in Cities too so I don&rsquo;t really care for LTE. I pay 9,90&euro; a month for 1GB, 1000SMS, 1000Minutes and every GB more only costs me 4&euro;. <br />
The thing is: we have no Play Store for Devices and LG sells the Nexus 4 for 549&euro;!!</p>
<p>wow, could you import?&hellip; that is an outrageous price for the lg hardware. <br />
(good service plan price though)</p>
<p>Yeah, sure! Half an hour and I&#8217;m in Germany :-) And yeah our data/service plans are great! Austria is quite small and we have 4 major and about 10 sub-carriers who fight quite hard for customers. With my plan (mentioned above) i can switch to other carriers  whenever I want and there are no additional fees. I also don&#8217;t have any tethering/facetime/skype/whatever fees to pay and everything is available as it should be!</p>
<p>Would you trade your 4S for this?</p>
<p>In a heatbeat. Already pre-ordered.</p>
<p>Heartbeat*<br />
Damn editbutton.</p>
<p>People forget though that the verge editors incorporate this into their jobs where they have to constantly reload data. Obviously they are going to be sore about no LTE and so will others. I look at it like this, LTE is the only thing that stops this phone from scoring a 9. Also standards change it crazy to hold scoring standards to the same they were a year ago. The industry changes on a monthly basis. Also Id like to know if anyone else reviewed  this phone besides josh.</p>
<p>Typo: though not a quantum lead forward (quantum leap I imagine)</p>
<p>I am done with the Verge. Goind to Anandtech. The verge is an Apple territory. This is much better to feel you are &ldquo;genius&rdquo; that not. That is The Verge;&rsquo;s credo.</p>
<p>This is what I wanted Google&rsquo;s answer to the iPhone to be all along. Despite planning on getting either iPhone or Lumia 920, this lovely Andriod phone will be chosen instead :) I disliked Android &rsquo;till this moment.<br />
Living in germany the lack of LTE is no biggie.</p>
<p>Also: mic gain was too high, Josh&rsquo;s voice clipped in the video review all the time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve waited so long for a new Nexus phone, and this one from LG&mdash;who would&rsquo;ve known?&mdash;just takes the cake. Lack of LTE doesn&rsquo;t bother me one bit. That understated hardware design with Android 4.2 is just beautiful.</p>
<p>I got truly unlimited data with TMO.  So the answer is easy for me.  And my speeds are pretty comparable with LTE not as fast but I can stream netflix until the cows come home.  LTE users can stream LTE faster for much less hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I stated above, Google says the Nexus 4 is the fastest phone around right now. Whether that&rsquo;s true or not, I can say that performance and responsiveness on the device is second to none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you ARE saying that it&rsquo;s true.  LOL.</p>
<p>I like this phone alot but I have to say that if you live in a LTE market then this is not the best upgrade for you. For everybody else, its a no brainer save for the people who are tied into iOS. <br />
I would rather get any LTE phone (high end phone with unlocked bootloaders) and go the XDA route to get my updates. Infact I am running SGS3 on AOKP 4.1.2 with nexus 4 camera and photo sphere feature. I know that as soon as android 4.2 gets pushed to AOSP, I will get the updates for my SGS3 in no time.</p>
<p>And before somebody says something about XDA being too technical &hellip; let me tell you that most people don&rsquo;t even know about nexus phones. Only nerds know about it and I am sure they can handle information from XDA just fine.</p>
<p>No mention of Miracast or Slimport? Those are features that may prove very useful.</p>
<p>I think people get too caught in the final score of the product. The score reflect the reviewer&rsquo;s usage and lifestyle. Quite probably, your usage will be quite different, so it&rsquo;s better to read the review and ignore the score as much as possible.</p>
<p>I still think their scoring system is very inconsistent and sucks.</p>
<p>Love the design of it, very nice attractive price, but what went wrong with Micro SD slot ? 16Gb of memory is no go for me way too small.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d get this regardless of LTE. I can easily pull down 10 Mbps on HSPA on my iPhone 4S, this thing should get even more since it has dual carrier support.</p>
<p>The issue you take with lack of LTE is just baffling to me, on HSPA+ you get least twice the speed of an average US broadband connection, this is not like going from GPRS to HSPA, this is like going from ADSL to cable, is it faster, sure, is it going to make that much of a difference to an user?, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Not to mention LTE coverage is still patchy at best, and it&rsquo;s only just being rolled out in countries like the UK.</p>
<p>As far as the phone goes, it is great to see Android mature, up until Gingerbread it has been downright ugly, it was unresponsive and laggy to the point of frustration and the manufacturers seemed more focused on pushing specs than on improving the user experience. ICS was amazing leap forward, specially with the HW accelerated UI.</p>
<p>This whole LTE (or lack thereof) thing is a perfect example of voting with your wallet. If you want to maintain the status quo and let carriers dictate how cellphones are made and what features they have then you buy iPhone 5. If on the other hand, you want to be able to buy any cellphone and use it on any network and tether your devices to use the data you already paid for without extra fees then you buy the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>Is there multiple users on the phone or just tablet? It would be useful for a friend to be able to check their email on my phone i guess&hellip; How&rsquo;s that gunna work?</p>
<p>Tablet only, for now. I&rsquo;ve heard that may be because Nokia has a patent on it for phones. It may also be that it&rsquo;s just not as useful a feature on phones as it is on a tablet (since a tablet is more likely to be a shared family device).</p>
<p>In the screenshot of the quick settings shade what is that first picture then? I&rsquo;m probably wrong but it&rsquo;s got me thinking</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with a 8.3 for the Nexus 4.<br />
Josh seems to be frustrated only because of LTE.<br />
The glass back looks nice but breaks to easy.<br />
Android is by far more advanced than iOS or WP.<br />
And this Nexus makes so many things  right. I hope they will bring out a LTE version.<br />
In Europe LTE isn&rsquo;t a deal yet. So nothing speaks against this phone, especially for this price it&rsquo;s the best phone on the market!</p>
<p>This is absolutely on par with phones like Note II. <br />LTE is not a big concern to countries outside US.</p>
<p>What are the official numbers on LTE usage in the USA?</p>
<p>two other reviews said the battery was horrible &ndash; TC and Engd&hellip; could this be because the phones are still not production units?</p>
<p>This is because of Android need 4 core to run smooth.</p>
<p>4 cores do not waste battery life. In many ways, 4 cores actually save battery life.</p>
<p>The biggest power draw is the screen. Always is on smartphones.</p>
<p>The screen is not top notch on android. And android devices live less time. that is CORES.</p>
<p>The screen is not top notch on android. And android devices live less time. Why? That is CORES and cores only ie &ndash; more CPU needed for a Java.</p>
<p>I would assume it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re not production units like you mentioned.</p>
<p>Anyone know if the issue of low volume media playback on the GNex has been fixed on this phone? I love the GNex but hate this issue.</p>
<p>It mentions high speakers.</p>
<p>Yeah I saw that but it was referring to call volume etc., not media playback. Did I miss it somewhere else?</p>
<p>I agree that was unclear.</p>
<p>Guess I&rsquo;ll have to buy one and find out! :)</p>
<p>I find this hilarious,  when the iphone 4S came out every android fan bashed it for not having LTE. then this year there flag ship phone didnt come with it&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p>A phone that cost a minimum of 650 should have LTE. Obviously Google sacrificed some components to save money for the consumer. That&#8217;s why most of us are okay with it. Personally I have T-Mobile so it doesn&#8217;t bother me but it would have been nice to see an LTE version for those Nexus users stuck on Verizon. That&#8217;s my 2 cents at least.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s getting bashed for this phone&#8217;s lack of LTE too so what&#8217;s your point?</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think LTE is that big of a deal coming from a person that runs a iPhone 5 on straight talk. I average 5mbps down and find that is enough to do anything I want including running Xbox live or Netflix off it in a pinch. I&rsquo;d rather take that and better battery and most important a 45$ payment a month as opposed to 100$+ and LTE any day. Also after having the iPhone 4 I miss the glass back a bit. No need to worry about scratches what so ever with glass. Just don&rsquo;t drop your phone :)</p>
<p>The verge reviews&rsquo; score seems so irrelevant and inconsistent. I will try to ignore them now.</p>
<p>Dear The Verge, the rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t have LTE and Google have played it smart. There are incompatibilities between the various 4G technologies (frequencies)  &ndash; for example, an iPhone 5 on EE here in the UK won&rsquo;t work on Vodafone/O2&rsquo;s forthcoming 4G service. What Google want (as I imagine do Apple in their hearts) is a world-phone. By sticking with tried and tested technology, they have produced a phone that offers 95% of what people want and use most of the time. Come on, if you&rsquo;re watching a movie, you&rsquo;ll watch it on the big screen at home or on your tablet or laptop &ndash; and therefore have WiFi access or a saved version. If you are out and about, you won&rsquo;t NEED 4G to text, email or even web browse/update social media. HSDPA is fast enough for that 95%.<br />
Yes, for tethering 4G will be great, but then that requires coverage away from cities where you don&rsquo;t have WiFi, and as far as I&rsquo;m aware, no one offers LTE in rural areas anywhere on Earth &ndash; and that Sir, is the heart of the problem &ndash; coverage!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a Nexus 4, because it&rsquo;s innovative, versatile and affordable.</p>
<p>No LTE is fine with me because I&rsquo;m gunna use it on T-Mobile&rsquo;s prepaid 30$ a month plan and pay a fraction of the price people pay with phones on contracts.</p>
<p>Okay. Congratulations.</p>
<p>Same here. I&#8217;m done spending $90 dollars when you can get a great connection and more data allowance for 1/3 of that.</p>
<p>Just came here to voice my opinion in the comments.</p>
<p>8.3???</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m28ytw6SFA1r32yfb.gif" /></p>
<p>Looks nice.  I got T-mobile Pre paid, There won&rsquo;t be LTE till the new year and even than i not sure our area will be getting LTE when they start it, So the lack of LTE is not a big negitaive.  It has HSPA42 so if your network has the upgrade that would be nice.  This will be my next phone as my Samsung Galaxy Mini, the Dart on t-mobile, lack the spec for anything modern for today.</p>
<p>As an European, I and 3 friends of my friends can&rsquo;t wait to get it.</p>
<p>you are not so clever if you choose this. sorry but that is true.</p>
<p>Why? This is almost one of the best phones on the market, apart from the lack of LTE.</p>
<p>Pray, do tell, what other phone is better suited for him&#8230;since you&#8217;re so clever.</p>
<p>$349 for a flagship phone off contract = win.</p>
<p>A phone without LTE?  That&rsquo;s a moot point if you don&rsquo;t live in an LTE coverage area.  Even though I will probably end up with aWP8 device as my main daily phone, I&rsquo;ll pick one of these up for sure.  The low price with no contract is the selling point for this device.</p>
<p>I currently have a Thunderbolt and unlimited data plan with Verizon. I have 4 months left on my contract. I&rsquo;ll be jumping to T-Mobile for this phone. LTE, in my opinion, is nice but not worth the price. I pay just over $85/month. There is no phone coming to Verizon that I truly want. I am also not willing to pay the same amount and be forced into a tiered data plan. Same price but only 1 GB of data. Ridiculous. Cancelling my contract ($150 versus $340 if I wait it out) and switching over.</p>
<p>Look at t-mobile&rsquo;s $30 monthly 4g plan.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m looking at, actually. I&rsquo;d be saving approximately $600 a year. It&rsquo;s ridiculous to think I&rsquo;ve been spending that much for service. I&rsquo;m very excited about the Nexus 4. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
<p>I was in your situation a few years back, I can tell you it&#8217;s definitely worth trading in Verizon for T-Mobile, as long as you can get service where you live and work. Me and my girl are on the value plan and pay 95 a month, for 1000 talk, unlimited text, and 2Gb of highspeed data on each phone, followed by unlimited Edge. I&#8217;ve never once regretted it.</p>
<p>I live in Los Angeles. I&#8217;ve spoken to about 6 people I know on T-Mobile and they&#8217;re all happy with the service. I really have nothing to lose by giving them a shot and a whole lot of money to gain.</p>
<p>As a non-American without a BYO LTE phone? Score!</p>
<p>Once lte hits in 2013 you are gonna look at it as fail.</p>
<p>Very happy with performance and battery life.<br />
For a UK guy on a HSPA+ network, this is a great buy cant wait for that pre order page to get active on Google Play</p>
<blockquote>The easiest way to describe the functionality is to say it&rsquo;s like having the ability to take your own Street View photos&hellip; pretty much anywhere.</blockquote>
<p>Let me fix that for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The easiest way to describe the functionality <strong> is to point you do an iPhone or Windows Phone and install the Photosynth app.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google released Street View before Microsoft released Photosynth, so there&rsquo;s no need to fix anything, A for effort though.</p>
<p>This is built-in to the OS. Third party apps do not matter here.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re trying to describe a feature using an app <strong>nobody knows</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>FAIL</p>
<p>Whe Apple put Glass on their iPhone&rsquo;s 4 and 4s The Verge Says &ldquo;Premium Quality Build, Bravo&rdquo;, when Google puts Glass on the phone Back The Verge Says: &ldquo;Glass backing breaks easily&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Objectivity Please!</p>
<p>ok, glass on the back is bad in both cases, lol</p>
<p>His review unit broke, I think that&rsquo;s justifiable cause</p>
<p>Do we think this will run on MySimpleMobile here in the US? If you take the device cost and pair it with an off-contract pre-paid plan, you&rsquo;d get a lot of tech for a little money.</p>
<p>Kind of intriguing.</p>
<p>Yes. Simple Mobile has micro sims and runs on Tmo network with HSPA+ with speeds of 42.2 mbps.</p>
<p>That camera app kicks ass now</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but this is intended as a global phone. Every single US review I&rsquo;ve seen throws a hissy fit about not getting this on LTE, despite the fact that it is blindingly obvious that Google would sell more, make more money from and benefit more from a device without LTE that doesn&rsquo;t sell a single handset in the US than from an LTE device that sells as well as this one looks set to everywhere else. It didn&rsquo;t really fit with Google Nexus ideals, either. The carriers in the US (apparently) changed the GNex too much, and isn&rsquo;t this kind of what all Nexus devices are trying to get away from? The Nexus devices supposed to be un compromised, and it sounds like carrier versions in the US of the GNex were compromises.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still got an iphone 4 (contracts in Canada tend to be 3 years) and it&rsquo;s the data caps that make me totally unenthusiastic about faster speeds.</p>
<p>Google&hellip;.. GOOGLE!!! WHYYYYY</p>
<p>How did this phone and the 920 both get 8s for camera?</p>
<p>Camera software.</p>
<p>and the fact that 920 only shines when it comes to taking dark photos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip; I don&rsquo;t feel any hesitation in saying that the pure Android 4.2 experience is &mdash; at least in my estimation &mdash; the most advanced mobile operating system on the market&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Josh Topolsky&mdash;-</p>
<p>Haha! Gruber just spat his coffee on his iPad reading this line!</p>
<p>Engadget claims they got a little over 5 hours and The Verge claims they are getting around 19 hours (10.5 hours at 55% use and 16 hours at 82% use is 19 hours at 100% use).</p>
<p>How can they be 13+ hours apart?</p>
<p>They test it differently. Engadget&rsquo;s is running with the screen on. Josh&rsquo;s usage was actual usage of the phone, where the screen isn&rsquo;t on 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Uses phone on drastically slower network, complains about speed.</p>
<p>But really, AT&T is only HSPA+21, whereas T-Mobile supports HSPA+42. PC Magazine&rsquo;s tests from earlier this year show that T-Mobile is faster by a factor of 2-4x depending on location.</p>
<p>I think the verge either needs to change the category or Reception/Call Quality or add a new one for Data Quality, according to the REPORT, the call quality and reception was amazing, they just dinged it for not having LTE.  At the same time, there&rsquo;s Wi-Fi freaking everywhere that you can connect to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be interesting to see how this would score with LTE.<br />
Pretty disappointed with the review overall. I don&rsquo;t care about LTE but the  fragile back is a bummer and I was hoping the screen would be class leading.</p>
<p>8.3?! Let me put this into perspective. The iPad Mini got a 9.0. I realise they aren&rsquo;t directly comparable, but the rating system is exactly same.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re different products. To the Verge, lack of LTE is a huge letdown. I don&rsquo;t discredit them for that.</p>
<p>Either the new Windows Phones need to score higher or this needs to score lower. I mean&hellip; a washed out screen and a fragile back? No LTE? And it scores higher than the Lumia 920 and 8X? C&rsquo;mon, man&hellip;</p>
<p>Also, how is WP8&rsquo;s performance lower? They should be around the same.</p>
<p>Goddamn, so much hate for not LTE, I never had LTE and I don&rsquo;t find myself complaining, for someone like Joshua is a vital one, but for most of the normal geeks I don&rsquo;t see the execisive expectations for LTE, I find it as fast great network.<br />
But a Nexus is about being pure and always up-to-date, Joshua went off Verizon exactly because of that.<br />
I also can say that battery life and price are top-notch killers.<br />
People LOVED the iPhone with the glass back and they always defended the LTE part, but as fast as the Nexus gets that everybody is like &lsquo;SO FUCKING FRUSTATING", I expected more of a neutral review and less of &rsquo;I WANT MY LTE BECAUSE I&rsquo;M A HEAVY USER"</p>
<p>If you live in an urban area that has great LTE coverage, I can see how it might be frustrating for a &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; phone to not have it. However, for the rest of us, it&rsquo;s basically a non-issue.</p>
<p>No LTE!<br />
No removable battery!<br />
No external storage!<br />
It has a glass back!</p>
<p>Does that sound familiar? Yes, that&rsquo;s the BS nitpicks that the google fanboys has been saying about prior iPhones. Looks like Karma has caught up to you. Enjoy your phone Googlers!</p>
<p>I will, thanks. My 10mbps+ on T-Mobile will suit me just fine :)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll enjoy our $300 contract-free phone with leading hardware.</p>
<p>This leading hardware?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6425/google-nexus-4-and-nexus-10-review/2" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6425/google-nexus-4-and-nexus-10-review/2</a></p>
<p>Come back when the iPhone&#8217;s display actually shows HD video. All that &#8216;retina&#8217; crap and it&#8217;s still too low res to display 720p video. Oh you don&#8217;t want to watch video on that small screen? BS.</p>
<p>Retina screens show 1080p video as clearly as the tv I&#8217;m watching right now. If anything, the IMAX scenes in The Dark Knight look better using a 1080p file on my iPad than they do on Blu-Ray, albeit being much smaller.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m replacing my iPhone 4 with a Nexus 4, but can you really make the case people can tell the difference between 720p straight up and 720p downscaled to 640p?  Who cares.  Small screen?  Christ, I wish there were Android phones top specced at 4 inches.</p>
<p>Can someone explain the fascination with LTE for a mobile phone?  Unless you&rsquo;re needing it to tether or your current speeds aren&rsquo;t keeping up with streaming video.  Then lower speeds seem to work just fine.  Who is downloading huge files to their phones?  I have an iPhone 5 w/ LTE and have yet to feel an improvement just because of LTE.</p>
<p>Well my Sprint 3G speeds are so horrible that I can&rsquo;t stream any music while driving (which I do a lot of) so LTE is a must for me&hellip;</p>
<p>Seems like that might be a problem w/ Sprint&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>Sprint is shit on 3G, go with another carrier and you&#8217;ll find out the difference</p>
<p>Go:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405596,00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405596,00.asp</a></p>
<p>Same here.. I&rsquo;m just happy to have great HSPA+ where I live. I think if you never had LTE you&rsquo;re probably not craving for it. Plus it will kill your battery.</p>
<p>The only serious scenario I can think of is tethering, since LTE is faster than most WiFi you could have access to while traveling. But you definitely pay a premium for that service (data + bullshit tethering charge).</p>
<p>Did you include a bad panorama pic in the review on purpose? Pics with such artifacts can be taken with any panorama software. It takes a little skill to get it right (artifact free) on any platform..</p>
<p>Not sure what&rsquo;s happening, but I&rsquo;ve done the math and its score is 8.5, not 8.3. You guys should check that out</p>
<p>yeah, didnt add up for me either, when you throw tens in the mix its hard to get the score down to 8.3, even with 6&rsquo;s</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an average. Scores can be adjusted up or down based on various factors. The lack of LTE makes this an 8.3 instead of an 8.5+</p>
<p>I dont see why they would do that. Josh seems to think that this is an awesome device and the only weakness is the lack of LTE. Anyhow, this is not a worldwide review (as it should be, because it&rsquo;s an international device), and if you live anywhere else (not in the USA), this is the best phone you can get.</p>
<p>Well they do indicate that the final review score may be adjusted even if the averages don&rsquo;t add up. In this case, it seems Josh saw fit to give it a lower score than than the average?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a weighted average.</p>
<p>I have no interest in LTE (UK) until my contract runs out next year. The prices over here in comparison to 3g hspa.</p>
<p>The glass back (why?), limited storage, washed out screen and non-removable battery are the biggest issues for me!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give it around an 8.8-.9 realistically for the majority of people who matter (people who don&rsquo;t use LTE)</p>
<p>Again why does the price not come into the equation&hellip; I mean seriously? why the phrase &ldquo;half the price of the Iphone 5&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t get done to death I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>To me, the fact that this thing is so much cheaper than other state-of-the-art unlocked phones, combined with the lower prices available  from MVNO&rsquo;s or prepaid service through T-Mobile makes this a wholly different value proposition than some carrier-subsidized LTE device.  I&rsquo;d love to see lifetime cost factored into these reviews.  LTE is great.  Is it worth $1000+ over a two-year contract,?  Less clear.</p>
<p>As the review points out, the mobile landscape has changed dramatically over the past year, especially with the new surge in popularity of prepaid service. I&rsquo;m voting with my wallet to encourage reasonably-priced, unlocked phones.</p>
<p>People that get this phone basically gonna do the same thing iPhone 4/4S been doing: put it in a case to protect the back.</p>
<p>Yeah exactly. I don&rsquo;t know why they&rsquo;ve done it though. So many smashed Iphones over the past few years.</p>
<p>What I find funny is that here the author pointed out the glass back but the iPhone of course got a pass on that as usual..</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just going to try and be real careful. Phones should never have cases on them.</p>
<p>what weather widget is that in the photos?</p>
<p>" haters gonna hate" <br />
3lw</p>
<p>and i cant find a better place to apply at. If you don&rsquo;t like it don&rsquo;t get it. As for me on the other hand Im spending the money I had saved up  for the note 2 on the n4,n10 and month of cell phone service.</p>
<p>My &ldquo;adjusted for bias&rdquo; Verge score for this vs the Lumia 920 puts the Lumia on top for me&hellip;thanks Verge!</p>
<p>The Verge aren&#8217;t biased. The score for the 920 was the correct score.</p>
<p>This is extremely tempting. Too bad I got an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>that wasnt a bad choice.  hhhhaha</p>
<p>If you wanted to recoup some money&hellip; you could sell it second hand and have around &pound;100 after buying a brand new nexus 4 :P</p>
<p>I just watched the video, and its much more reasonable than the text comes across as on the LTE issue. Many reminders that for a majority of people, the cons mentioned won&rsquo;t be significant and that this is the Android phone to get.</p>
<p>Nice review, great looking phone, TIMN.</p>
<p>But I do think that no LTE, if not completely relevant in the context of discussing this phone, is an indicator of a wider problem with Android &ndash; that is, that for a consumer who wants LTE and the latest version of stock Android, there is literally no option.</p>
<p>Good review. I&rsquo;d like to point out two things though:</p>
<p>1. This has DCHSPA+ 42 Mbps, which can get very close to LTE speeds on capable networks. So, its not such a huge deal as most people are making it out to be.</p>
<p>2. Almost every review has given the Optimus G&rsquo;s display a big thumbs up and the Nexus 4 has the exact same display, yet somehow, Josh finds it washed out?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m concerned about that back glass too, but I&rsquo;m always careful with my phones, never broken one, so it should be fine. Or get a good quality clear case for it. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Honestly, I switched to Verizon last year because of LTE. I was super excited about all the things I would be able to do with the added speed. A year later I realized that the monthly price and speed &ldquo;on the ego&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really worth it anymore.  I think the carriers have reached a point where people dont want to pay that much for their mobile service.  Until LTE becomes more of a standard and you can take your device between carriers it is going to be simple price gouging.</p>
<p>I think the best thing for the american consumer would be a huge number of people switch to T-Mobile and get this device.  Its the only thing thats going to get rid of the silly gates and price gouging.</p>
<p>This phone will be my next. I live in SF where T-Moibles speeds are amazing and I have wifi at home and at the office.</p>
<p>lol.. &ldquo;speed on the go&rdquo; but &ldquo;speed on the Ego&rdquo; works as well.</p>
<p>I thought that&#8217;s exactly what you meant, since having LTE is pretty much a bragging point. I can only think of streaming full-length movies as the one mobile activity LTE would perform head and shoulders over HSPA+42. Most of everything else I do can already be done on 3G, even more so on HSPA+42.</p>
<p>So much WANT, though the glass back is unsettling (speaking as someone who always magically manage to drop her phone). I guess I&rsquo;ll stick with the GNex for now. It&rsquo;s sufficient as my daily driver, and I don&rsquo;t see a OMGWTFBBQ MUST GET reason to &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo;&hellip; unless it doesn&rsquo;t get 5.0 next year.</p>
<p>As a Sprint user in San Diego, I&rsquo;ve never had experience with WiMax 4g or 4g LTE. Judging by Sprint&rsquo;s current attitude toward San Diego, there won&rsquo;t be 4g here for at minimum, another year. I&rsquo;m gladly switching to T-Mobile when my contract expires January 1st. As of right now, I get .5 mbps down on a good day and I&rsquo;m tired of that trash. I don&rsquo;t need LTE when it won&rsquo;t work, and the 3g speeds to fall back on are completely useless. I&rsquo;ll take the Nexus 4, please.</p>
<p>My score:</p>
<blockquote>
DESIGN &mdash; 8<br />DISPLAY &mdash; 9<br />CAMERA &mdash; 8<br />RECEPTION / CALL QUALITY &mdash; 9<br />PERFORMANCE &mdash; 10<br />SOFTWARE &mdash; 10<br />BATTERY LIFE &mdash; 9<br />ECOSYSTEM &mdash; 9<br /><br /><strong>Final score: 9.0</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; u havent even touched it</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what she said.</p>
<p>Answering your comment more directly, I only adjusted the display and reception scores to take into account my own needs and standards. Lack of LTE doesn&#8217;t really matter to me, and considering that Josh thought the call quality was exceptional, I took the liberty of adding an extra 3 points. Since the display is larger and isn&#8217;t AMOLED, I gave it a one-point bump from the clearly inferior screen of the Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Of course, this is entirely based on my own opinion and I&#8217;m in no way pretending my analysis is more or even as valid as Josh&#8217;s. I merely weighted points differently based on his review.</p>
<p>As a 3 user in the UK, with DC HSPA coming within 6 months, I&rsquo;m going to get this and balls to LTE tbh.</p>
<p>Although support for Threes LTE would be nice (800Mhz).</p>
<p>Since making the leap to the very first iPhone, followed by the 3s, 4, 4s and now 5, I&rsquo;ve followed developments on the Android front due to our standardization with Google Apps for Business and the Chromebook for cloud services such as 37 Signals.</p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;m with Josh that as an ATT sub, LTE is a very big deal. Second, while Android is more polished today than 12 months ago, overall OS performance, polish and critical third-party app quality is still far removed from iOS.</p>
<p>Finally, while no Android phone matches the build quality and overall user experience of the iPhone, I could manage a downgrade if the Android tablet space wasn&rsquo;t such a wasteland. Actually, I&rsquo;d love for Apple to provide a product akin to Google Apps for Business, building on iCloud, which is actually much improved now that I use it for personal e-mail/cloud service.</p>
<p>The review unit was cracked during the reviews. Doesn&rsquo;t Inspire confidence.</p>
<p>Yeah that&rsquo;s what happens when you drop glass phones on the ground from 3 feet up. I&rsquo;m getting this phone but am not super stoked about this glass back at all.</p>
<p>Not really. I&#8217;ve had my iPhone 4 for 2.5 years now. It&#8217;s fallen on wood floors, concrete, pavement, rocks, desks, all sort of hard things. It&#8217;s got a couple of tiny nicks and a couple of minor scratches. I&#8217;ve had no real issues with the glass.</p>
<p>Yeah. I don&rsquo;t get it. The Nexus 4  &ndash; &ldquo;is a handsome, yet relatively uninspired device&rdquo;. The iPhone 4S &ndash; &ldquo;The glass back &mdash; while incredibly prone to shattering on impact &mdash; feels as sleek and sexy as ever. The metal antenna and solid, machined buttons feel high-end, expensive even. If this were a car, it would be a Mercedes..&rdquo; Seems like two completely different standards are being used to compare Apple and Android products. Gush much?</p>
<p>Not really. Are you saying that because they&#8217;re both glass covered? If the Nexus 4 looks similar to the Galaxy Nexus, as the review said, then yeah, the iPhone does look a hell of a lot nicer.</p>
<p>No. I&#8217;m saying that the iPhone 4S hadn&#8217;t changed much from the iPhone 4. The Nexus 4 hasn&#8217;t changed much from the Nexus. But the ways of conveying that sentiment of continuance of the design lines are totally different &#8211; negative sentiment versus positive sentiment. I actually like the Nexus 4 design more than the iPhone slab. But whatever &#8211; to each his own.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d give anything to own this Nexus with LTE.  Perhaps its time to finally try something else. Lumia 920 seems like the next best thing.</p>
<p>- one sad Android fan.</p>
<p>Is there really something you can&rsquo;t do with HSPA+ that you can with LTE?</p>
<p>Burn through your data cap in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>lol&hellip;data cap.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have one on Three UK. But if I moved to T-Mobile to get LTE I would be able to burn it in a min.</p>
<p>Lumia 920 the next best thing? Ever heard of the LG Optimus G, which is exactly the same as this phone, plus LTE?</p>
<p>Is hspa+ available wherever lte is available on AT&T&rsquo;s network.?</p>
<p>Why the F*** would you need 25mb/s download speed on a mobile phone?</p>
<p>The ability to watch HD streaming video without delays or stuttering.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>8.3 for a device of this value &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know why I bother reading reviews on this Apple biased website.  The iPad Mini gets a 9+ rating when it is completely out of date, tech-wise; the iPhone 5 is drooled over when it has a crippled maps application, incompatible connector and non-standard screen dimensions&hellip; and this device receives sub 8.5.  LTE apart, this phone is ground breaking in its value and specs, with a fantastic OS.</p>
<p>Just look at the comments, The Verge, your bias is starting to undermine your credibility.</p>
<p>actually&hellip;unless the score is not an average of the break down,</p>
<p>it DID get an 8.5</p>
<p>Average of Nexus4 score= 8.5, but they give it 8.3<br />
Average of Ipad mini score=8.5, but they give it 9.0<br />
.7 points difference.<br />
Draw your own conclusions from this&hellip;</p>
<p>My conclusions: Josh really liked the iPad mini so he gave it a higher score to represent that. At the same time, he was dissatisfied that the Nexus 4 doesn&rsquo;t have LTE so he gave it a lower one.</p>
<p>Once again, gadget reviews are entirely subjective.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a HUGE android fan, and will be getting the device. As for the score, I think it&rsquo;s completely fair; the lack of LTE is a letdown.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the actual score that annoys me&hellip; but the disparity in critique between Apple and non-Apple devices on this website.  Sati&rsquo;s response says it all&hellip; great spot.</p>
<p>Josh said &ldquo;the iPhone 4 is the best smartphone on the market right now&rdquo;&hellip; you could not make calls whilst holding the phone in a natural way.</p>
<p>Oh please with that antenna issue already! Very little people actually had that problem.</p>
<p>*very few&hellip;oy. Editable comments coming when?</p>
<p>Everyone I know who had the 4 had that problem.  If it wasn&#8217;t an issue then Apple probably wouldn&#8217;t have issued free &#8216;rubber sheaths&#8217; to every purchaser, and then went on to &#8216;advertise&#8217; the dual antennas in the 4S&#8230;</p>
<p>*knew &#8230; agree on the editable comments point! ;-)</p>
<p>Settle down Junior.</p>
<p>The iPad mini received a 9 because it is a fantastic product. Go read all the other reviews that have been published. The general consensus is that it&rsquo;s just a great product no matter how you spin it. Seriously though, go read them &mdash; I&rsquo;ll wait. I already know you&rsquo;re an Android user because you just had to mention phone specifications. Apple cares about delivering a great experience to its customers, and since they and the mini do just that, who cares how old its internals are? It doesn&rsquo;t lag, its screen is great minus its lower resolution (which plenty of reviewers have said isn&rsquo;t a deal breaker), it has two awesome cameras, wicked battery life, an unrivaled build quality, and it has access to the biggest ecosystem available. You know, the one that has over 275,000 tablet designed apps. And don&rsquo;t give me that bullshit argument that scaled-up phone apps do the job. You&rsquo;re not kidding anyone.</p>
<p>As for the iPhone 5.. non-standard screen dimensions? REALLY? That is the most retarded thing I have ever heard. Screen size is ENTIRELY SUBJECTIVE. I for one prefer a smaller 4" screen and do not want a 4.8" screen.</p>
<p>You are absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>Haha, this response cracked me up&#8230; seriously.  Writing this on my MacBook I am probably not the anti-Apple haterman (&lt; opposite of fanboy?) you think&#8230; Let&#8217;s not pretend Apple don&#8217;t bleat about specs, all tech companies do.  LTE is missing, I presume, because Google / LG wanted to keep the price down.  The iPad Mini has out-dated internals because Apple wanted to keep the price down.  One is marked down for the compromise, one isn&#8217;t.  For me, a tablet with a resolution lower than my phone / MP3 player is a greater loss (considering a tablet is all about screen!) than not having LTE&#8230; of course, subjective, as you say. I&#8217;m glad you like your 4&quot; screen&#8230; I wonder if you extolled the &#8216;sweet spot&#8217; dimensions of the 3.5&quot; screen prior to the size bump&#8230; :-)</p>
<p>Sounds like you did voice mixing!</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t The Verge do review Q & As anymore? Those were cool.</p>
<p>Time constraints perhaps? Too many fanboy arguments?</p>
<p>They did a similar thing with the iPad mini, but Josh just created a new topic under the Apple Core forum instead of building it into the review.</p>
<p>meh, sound nice but think I&rsquo;ll keep my GNex another year. <br />
-Glass is annoying<br />
-No removable battery is lame. <br />
- Not too upset about no LTE, since I&rsquo;ve never used it. But 25Mbps sounds nice, compared to my <br />
- Anandtech tests show battery life is pretty poor.</p>
<p>The GNex being my first android phone I&rsquo;m not sure i could stand to get a GSIII or something and suffer with crappy skins. That means if the next nexus is also lame I&rsquo;m screwed. Don&rsquo;t mess it up google!</p>
<p>ops.<br />
.. compared to my AT&T HSPA+ with </p>
<p>wtf?<br />
cutting off my text?</p>
<p>oh! and headphone jack on top?? I&rsquo;m now used to it on the bottom > Dealbreaker!</p>
<p>same.  dont see any reason to upgrade from my gnex besides a better screen and supposedly (?) better battery.  Dont really care about the glass because i always use a case, 1.2 ghz dual core is good enough for me, and no LTE really is a bummer&#8230;.</p>
<p>Great review. Being on T-Mobile, I have no problem with the lack of LTE but definitely see that as being a negative when it comes to AT&T users. Verizon&hellip;well that&rsquo;s just a whole different story.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to order mine in a week and a half!</p>
<p>I might get one of these and put my T-Mobile SIM in it as a spare phone, T-Mobile has LTE here but I don&rsquo;t want to pay &pound;50 a month to use it.</p>
<p>In the US they don&rsquo;t, and speeds are fantastic.</p>
<p>I am on Three at the moment, with unlimited data for &pound;15pm, who only have HSPA/DC-HSPA and get speeds of 15Mbps, but DC-HSPA upgrade is going on in my area which hopefully will get me around 20Mbps.</p>
<p>Im not sure if adding &ldquo;Glass backing breaks easily&rdquo; as a negative as you accidentally knocked it on the floor. If you don&rsquo;t do drop tests with all your other phones, its not a fair assessment!</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve lost count of how many iPhones I&#8217;ve seen with cracked fronts or backs&#8230; Can&#8217;t recall that fragility being mentioned in iPhone reviews I&#8217;ve read on this site&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s simply law of averages. There are a shitload more iPhones sold than any other individual type of phone.</p>
<p>Anyone else look up sagacity?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want LTE. If I buy this phone and throw it on T-Mobile, it will cost me $660 for a year of service, with the 8GB model. HSPA+ is plenty fast and LTE is simply not worth the ridiculous premium. If I wanted an SGS3 on Verizon&rsquo;s LTE with 2GB of data, it would cost me $1520 for one year, and I&rsquo;m locked into a two year deal. As a recent college graduate, price matters to me most, and I just don&rsquo;t understand the ridiculous LTE hype. This review acts like LTE cures cancer. HSPA+ is everywhere in my area, however Verizon&rsquo;s LTE is spotty, which means I&rsquo;ll mostly see EVDO Rev A, which is about 1Mb down in real world use. I&rsquo;ll take the average of 7Mb down I receive with T-Mobile. This review is missing the FACT that LTE is not available everywhere and costs more than double, when compared to off contract prepaid plans.  I&rsquo;ll jump on LTE when I can buy a data only plan, with at least 5GB of data, for under $40 a month. Until that happens, I&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; on the more than sufficient HSPA+.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree, but keep in mind that The Verge is reviewing <em>just</em> the phone. It&rsquo;s up to the customer to make an informed buying decision based on the other factors that matter to them (coverage, price, etc.).</p>
<p>Negatives:<br />
No LTE<br />
Low storage/ no microSD<br />
Glass back<br />
Non removable battery<br />DISSAPOINTING, so this just comes down to price for me now. Might just wait for GS4 at this point. <br />
But I&rsquo;m going to try and deal with verizon, if they don&rsquo;t give me a good deal with note2/htcDNA, bye. This phone cost of 2years on $30 Tmobile plan is $1070, Verizon is around ~$1000 more for comparable. I&rsquo;ll have to run the numbers. But the verge reviews don&rsquo;t really take into account cost of ownership.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because they review phones, not phone service. You take the review into consideration when selecting a device & carrier.</p>
<p>Well maybe they should. If devices are invariably tied to their carries why shouldn&#8217;t they be a part of the review.</p>
<p>This is, for me, the first nexus device worth consideration. Well done LG and Google!</p>
<p>So after questioning whether the glass design will break from drops while visiting the google campus&hellip;you &ldquo;accidently&rdquo; knocked the device to the floor&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks for testing this on behalf of your readers I guess haha.</p>
<p>On top of that the glass at the back of the phone is the exact same glass that goes on the front of the iPhone 5, or do phones only fall on their backs?</p>
<p>At least it takes a fall to crack it, the ceramic back cover on my iPhone 3GS didn&rsquo;t need that much help.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 is lighter, so falls with less force.</p>
<p>Also, different case designs will absorb differing amounts of the impact.</p>
<p>Does anyone at The Verge realise that they have a GLOBAL audience and this is a GLOBAL device? Josh, I&rsquo;m sorry but to call LTE &ldquo;the norm&rdquo; is a massive overstatement of the current coverage , please step outside of your US bubble and take a look around for a second.</p>
<p>The HTC One X did not have LTE (XL does) and that never got downgraded.<br />
The S3 did not have LTE (The S3 LTE version does) and that never got downgraded.</p>
<p>So yes I agree with your statement completely.</p>
<p>And of course people just gripe about the score.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably a good Nexus phone guys sorry about numbers.</p>
<p>LTE is the future, but until the carriers start delivering voice over it, it is just another battery sucking radio running on the device..  I believe none of the major carriers, and only one minor carrier does so in the US at this time..</p>
<p>Unfortunately with Android, upgrading the software to add voice over LTE  will probably mean a new phone anyway.</p>
<p>Not only that, but in many areas in Chicago T-Mobiles 42mbps HSPA+ is faster then ATTs LTE.</p>
<p>The odd thing about displays is how they look in different lighting.</p>
<p>My old ASUS UL30vt looks awesome under florescent lighting, the colors are very nice and accurate. But under incandescent they seem dull and with sun light (low amount) it looks a bit better. And my LG G2x under incandescent doesn&rsquo;t really look good but under sunlight compared to one x and iphone 5 it stands toe to toe on color vibrancy and brightness! but under indoor lighting of course its very lacking.</p>
<p>Long story short, screens and there filters are a funny thing and from what i read on other sites and from  others from the verge the screen is as good or better.</p>

<p>Hey look an Apple troll. You compare both devices but I&rsquo;m going take a guess that you own neither of them.</p>
<p>You should ask yourself why you went through the trouble of finding, editing and posting that picture in the first place.</p>
<p>Why do you think he&rsquo;s an Apple troll? I would MUCH rather have the bike on top&hellip; that guy is LIVING LARGE!</p>
<p>That guy is exerting a lot more energy than on the second bike.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see what the comparison means&#8230;</p>
<p>This is my Nextus.</p>
<p>Phone is nice but what&rsquo;s really great about this article is I finally found out what J-Top wears on his wrist. And it&rsquo;s beautiful. A stunning vintage Omega Seamaster. Not sure I like the strap but good on you J-Top for the quality timepiece. I knew you appreciated quality watches.</p>
<p>and boy, does he love Converse!</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how did you guys get this phone.??<br />
M guessing google dropped it off at your place, But the Nexus page still shows Coming soon..</p>

<p>The tech press actually get the devices shipped to them from the manufacturers in advanced of public sale. On the Vergecast, Josh showed off like 4 or 5 unreleased phones in his possession.</p>
<p>Is there a web page loading test done with 3G vs LTE vs Wifi? I feel like there is little difference in time to load a page between 3G and my wifi, which should be about 64x faster.. I.e. how much of a bottleneck is the CPU?</p>
<p>I hope the cracked back was just a fluke.</p>
<p>From Wired:</p>
<blockquote>The front and back of the device are coated in Gorilla Glass 2. I took a set of keys, a fork and a pocket knife to the front and back glass panels of the Nexus 4 and couldn&rsquo;t get a scratch to show up anywhere. I also slipped and dropped the phone while pulling it out of my pocket this week, and it showed no signs of my fumble.</blockquote>
<p>The glass is amazing and it even bends. Yet, apply just the right amount of force (like a drop) and it shatters.</p>
<p>Scratch resistance and breaking resistance are not the same thing. In fact they are opposites. And a fall is highly random stress, no two will be alike, or cause similar damage.</p>
<p>Pretty much yes. As you will learn in engineering classes, stress is something that has many variables and the right distance or length at the right angle and force can be the difference.</p>
<p>I still wonder about those rumors of multiple  nexus device rumors. So I am gonna wait til the  new year before I will buy it.  I  used LTE on an iPhone 5 and I wasnt impressed.  I definitely know that Tmo HSPA+ is in abundance in my area. I will probably get case to combat the potential  glass breakage. This iphone easily scratches too. I have to evaluate which prepaid network I will  use. I really like Simple mobile but T-mo has the ultimate 5GB data plan. I always could use wifi in the house.So I have to figure out what works the best for my pockets. Until then I will keep enjoying my Nexus S jelly bean  4.1.2 with 3.5G , limited storage, a NFC chip that doesnt work with Google Wallet. Still is faster than an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>I am leaning towards Simple Mobile. For $50 you get unlimited talk. text (international &amp; domestic), 4G data. You also get a $5 international calling credit as well. So far I think they have the plan to beat if you fall in their coverage area.</p>

<p>Who else thought Josh&rsquo;s voice got really weird around the 4:30-4:43 mark? Almost like a Clu from Tron: Legacy. Scared me a little.</p>
<p>I thought he just got a cold halfway through haha</p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p>Was definitely waiting for this review. I think this might be my first Android handset. I enjoy the iOS ecosystem, but just recently switched to a super-cheap T-Mobile prepaid plan. Since my city (Columbus, Ohio in case you&rsquo;re wondering) isn&rsquo;t on the fast track for T-Mob&rsquo;s 1900 MHz refarm, getting 1700 MHz 3G support would be an upgrade for me over my iPhone 4. And the $350 price (what used 4Ss are going for on craigslist) is a lot easier to stomach vs. the $650 iPhone 5, which would still only give me EDGE speeds :/</p>
<p>Looks like Gizmodo was getting average speeds of around 16 Mbps. Just goes to show that results are very location dependent, though the same could be said of LTE. All in all I think this reenforces the fact that the lack of LTE is being overplayed by just about everyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://updates.gizmodo.com/post/34831233868/google-nexus-4-review-yes-you-want-this-phone-by" target="new"></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about that. I live in Edmonton, Alberta (a major city in Canada for those of you who failed history class) and I average around 20 Mbps down with my iPhone 5.</p>
<p>On my 4S, I was averaging around 5-6 Mbps down. That&rsquo;s a big difference to someone who spends 45 minutes a day on the train commuting to and from school watching various videos and surfing on my phone.</p>
<p>I could never go back to HSPA+</p>
<p>The 4S only had HSPA 14.4. I don&#8217;t think you can really compare that with HSPA+42. You said it yourself, you were averaging 5-6 down. For those areas with T-Mobile HSPA+42 would you really argue that 16 down is insufficient but 20 is spectacular?</p>
<p>Anything important happen in Alberta? :)</p>
<p>I agree that LTE is so handy for work&hellip;. Plus I still have unlimited data from Verizon.  I hope that Google can work out differences with carriers before the end of my contract (which is fortunately in 12/2013) and make their flagship devices available for all.  Until then, this is why I have a Gnex, rooted and rocking.  As soon as someone ports 4.2 to this phone, I&rsquo;ll be just as happy as those with a Nexus 4.</p>
<p>If I had a contract,  I would die. I love the fact of freedom. Some prepaid networks work better than the actual networks they are based on.</p>
<p>Seems to be a fair review if I ignore the LTE part, since it doesn&rsquo;t exist here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with, I love your reviews. Always very thorough, as always with Verge writers. However, I am astonished that you didn&rsquo;t at least quickly cover in your video review WHY Google omitted LTE on the Nexus 4. I find that to be extremely important, as most people (casuals) will not understand and will just think, well, this device doesn&rsquo;t have LTE, better get an iPhone/W8 device. Now, of course casual smartphone owners likely wouldn&rsquo;t care too much about Google&rsquo;s philosophical view, but it is extremely important for people to know about it. Verizon (and other carriers) and Apple have had way too much control over devices that WE OWN, and Google has just taken a stand against that, and not nearly enough people are talking about it. All of the preliminary reviews and coverage have only talked about the lack of LTE, not why the device doesn&rsquo;t have it. I&rsquo;m a little disappointed.</p>
<p>You can support LTE without restricting freedom&hellip;.. HTC did it. Nokia did it. Samsung did it.</p>
<p>Not sure that I agree.  Most of the freedom here is about price and software updates.  HTC, Samsung, and Nokia don&rsquo;t sell a device with these specs at this pricepoint and they&rsquo;re all pretty slow with updates.</p>
<p>Honestly, the only way Google can hit the price is with volume.  Variations in LTE bands mean that in addition to the extra radio cost, they have to make multiple models, which cuts their volume efficiency. By the time you throw in CDMA networks requiring approval for software updates and you&rsquo;ve lost all the Nexus traits.</p>
<p>Right, thats because your government didn&rsquo;t decide put strict rules down unlike many others.</p>
<p>One LTE phone in Europe will work on all other European LTE networks.</p>
<p>Politics is a different discussion.  Google is making these decisions based on hitting an affordable unsubsidized price point.  A Pentaband HSPA+ device that excludes LTE hits the most users for the least dollars (or Euros, if you prefer).</p>
<p>Facts on the ground.</p>
<p>Yes. LTE isnt a deal breaker for me, I won&rsquo;t be able to access a LTE network till late 2013 but its a nice to have but not required and certainly does not make the phone worse.</p>
<p>Thanks for the review, I&rsquo;m excited about this phone.  The lack of LTE doesn&rsquo;t bug me much, given that I&rsquo;m upgrading from EVDO Rev-A and theoretically have good T-Mobile HSPA+ here.  One note &ndash; Based on a screenshot that I saw from the 4.2 system dump, the alarm will let you make the volume keys your snooze buttons.  I&rsquo;m not a snoozer, so I&rsquo;d have them set to disable the alarm, but if you need an easier target, physical buttons are about as easy as it gets.</p>
<p>Only 6  for  RECEPTION / CALL QUALITY ?!?<br />LOL</p>
<p>The article says it had amazing call quality. I&rsquo;m going to assume it was docked points because it didn&rsquo;t have LTE, but the category doesn&rsquo;t really state that having an LTE antenna is part of its criteria.</p>
<p>The glass back is what is really pressing me. I think this could be next phone, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Josh&rsquo;s lack of  approval makes me suspicious.</p>
<p>This would be my next and first Android phone&hellip;if it had LTE. Sorry but AT&T&rsquo;s network is horrible.</p>
<p>Love how josh can say &ldquo;It doesnt have LTE so its not really competitive with the iPhone or windows phones&rdquo; and the iPhone hasnt had LTE for 2 years while android phones have. He would never have said the iPhone wasn&rsquo;t competitive then&hellip;</p>
<p>True&hellip; and I&rsquo;ll agree, but in an age where every phone is becoming LTE, it is quite a glaring omission for a phone debuting in late 2012</p>
<p>When do you EVER need downloads with speed higher than 5mbit/s on a phone?! That&rsquo;s fast enough to stream a 1080p video from YouTube without buffering!!</p>
<p>Reception/Call Quality = 6??? The review said it had amazing call quality and reception one of the best. I understand it doesn&rsquo;t have LTE, but since LTE really has no bearing on Call Quality (No VoIP yet) the category really needs to be renamed if its losing 4 points for that.</p>
<p>95% is basically good enough for you Josh?  If only that were true.  :p</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just wait for the GS4</p>
<p>Too long to wait :p</p>
<p>Wow, this is definitely my next&hellip;once I have money. Damn you, college!</p>
<p>Is the 4.7" screen only used by some video apps just like the galaxy nexus, or are the gallery and games also in full screen on the nexus 4? Otherwise, this phone is the external size of the One X & Optimus G but only has 4.3" of usable screen except for videos&hellip;</p>
<p>Ah, being as clumsy as I am, I&rsquo;d break the back glass of this phone so easily. Also, that chrome ring around the front is gaudy and reminds me of my old Samsung Vibrant. I&rsquo;m sticking with my Galaxy Nexus as it will probably get 4.2 soon. Plus, I should probably save my money for when I finally get off T-Mobile and get a faster mobile data connection on AT&T or Verizon. But first, I must graduate and get a job!</p>
<p>I live in the UK where only one carrier has LTE at the moment, not in my area and hugely over priced! This phone is a no brainer and I can&rsquo;t wait to get mine :) Not that bothered about LTE either way, I&rsquo;m sure my device 1-2 years down the line may have it bt for the moment this is a beautiful phone for a great price.</p>
<p>If it comes to Verizon this will be my second phone.</p>
<p>And it has a barometer! This is the most exciting news for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cumulonimbus.barometernetwork">pressureNET</a> project, which collects user-submitted atmospheric pressure readings. We hope to build a new system of short-term local weather prediction. It&rsquo;s open source of course, and you can check out more details at <a href="http://cumulonimbus.ca" target="_blank">http://cumulonimbus.ca</a></p>
<p>This is my next. AT&T LTE be damned.</p>
<p>Please tell me how Nexus 4 with so so camera get the same camera score as Lumia 920 .  Is it because Lumia gives realistic, natural colors rather than over saturated instagram wannabe colors ?</p>
<p>Chris Ziegler this is not my next:<br />
&ldquo;Actually, let me first start with the Nexus 4, which is also not my next. I want to like this phone, having owned every Nexus phone before it &mdash; I adore stock Android, and I&rsquo;m excited about virtually everything that Google is trying to do with the platform right now (Google Now still creeps me out, but I&rsquo;m slowly coming around). But just read our review: it&rsquo;s a painfully iterative device. It&rsquo;s the Galaxy Nexus version 1.1. Google had clear and present opportunities to blow us away with a device that fixed the Galaxy Nexus&rsquo;s biggest shortcomings, and it appears that they chose &mdash; by will of Andy Rubin&rsquo;s stubbornness alone, no doubt &mdash; not to. <strong>Why is the camera not stellar?</strong> Why is it only available in black? Why, for the love of God, is there no LTE?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have to laugh every time I see reviewers take exception with a camera on a phone. Really, do people buy smartphones to take pictures?? I understand it&#8217;s a standard feature even on feature phones, and someone might take a picture sparingly every once in a while. But don&#8217;t act like it has to be a Canon.</p>
<p>Hey Google, MAKE ME A DAMN 4.3 INCH NEXUS! <br />
Must haves: removable battery, microSD card slot, non-glass back. <br />
You upgraded all the innards just fine, but I don&rsquo;t need any flair; I need a utilitarian BEAST.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to be waiting a long time. :)</p>
<p>I know. :(</p>
<p>When I see people wanting a microSD card slot, I just think back to the days when the iPhone was a niche thing and some people said that resistive touch screens were superior to capacitive&#8230;</p>
<p>Listen, I just like having the option and flexibility to use my phone to carry around large files and transfer them easily. It eliminates the need for a flash drive and even though I only carry around 6 GB of music (the rest is in the cloud), I like knowing I have extra. Whether it be for movies, podcasts, music, or whatever, it&#8217;s nice to have. Maybe I&#8217;m behind the times, but I know that I&#8217;m not alone, so save your condescension, please.</p>
<p>How did this phone score an 8.3, while the Nokia Lumia 920 received a 7.8?<br />
Clearly WP8 doesn&rsquo;t have a properly integrated ecosystem, yet! That is to say, they don&rsquo;t have as much apps in the market as Android or Apple.<br />
But the Nokia Lumia doesn&rsquo;t only contain better technology, but it also houses much more impressive hardware and materials.</p>
<p>This nexus device by LG (a Samsung-Copy-Cat) in my opinion deserves a 6.5 score.<br />
Plastic casing, NO LTE connectivity, and a design identical to Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Rethink your grading system.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see what impressive technology the 920 has. Granted, Nokias are well built, quality phones, but nothing out of the ordinary. And WP8&#8217;s interface sucks big time.</p>
<p>Not really impressed with anything here except one thing&hellip; The Street View-like photography.  This is really interesting technology and the fact that Google plans to use the user-data to add to street view mapping is also brilliant (and also a little creepy). I have the Google search App on iPhone and its clear that Google&rsquo;s speech algorithm/techniques are better than Siri&rsquo;s in that you get instant results as you speak. I also appreciate the simple, minimalist appearance of this app and the direction Android is going with the UI.  Hopefully, Jony Ive can scale back some of the gaudiness of the iOS interface, which was minimalist compared to Android just a year ago; but no longer.</p>
<p>LTE gate is = to  antenna gate for iPhone 4. lol</p>
<p>But unlike the iphone 4, No matter what way you hold the nexus 4, you still won&rsquo;t have LTE</p>
<p>lol nice!</p>
<p>If someone really wanted LTE speeds on the Nexus 4, all they need to do is get a Verizon Mifi or whatever they are called. With a 30 a month T-Mobile plan and a 30 dollar data plan, you&#8217;d have the best of both worlds for approx 55/month.</p>
<p>Damnit, stupid math. 60 per month.</p>
<p>Actually, no matter how you hold the iPhone 4, you still won&#8217;t have LTE.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more like the omission of Flash on iPhones. All over philosophical differences.</p>
<p>So tempted by this.  Seems like the perfect phone to buy here where the lack of LTE isn&rsquo;t going to be an issue for a couple of years at least. Looks like it could genuinely flop in the US though, which is a shame.</p>
<p>:/ I want a new nexus, but I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the design.</p>
<p>And yes, that&rsquo;s an important factor for me.</p>
<p>It needs to match your purse?</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 must be a difficult device to swallow for Android fanboys. No LTE, non-removable battery, no removable storage, glass back. Sounds familiar eh? All I can say is I didn&rsquo;t find that to be a problem with the iPhone 4/S and I don&rsquo;t think it will be a problem for the Nexus 4 either. LTE is nice to have but, IMO, not really essential. HSPA+ is fast enough in most situations. Glass back? Well you already have a glass front so  either way don&rsquo;t drop your phone or use a case if you&rsquo;re a ditzy person who drops your phone a lot. Non-removable battery? If it gets good battery life not a problem. No removable storage? This one isn&rsquo;t so clear cut because, IIRC, there&rsquo;s no 32 or 64GB model. So people who do want a lot of local storage are out of luck here. At least with the iPhone there are higher capacity models available.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a somewhat bitter pill to swallow in certain regards. We&#8217;re already use to the no SD card so I&#8217;m not even sure why Nexus owners are mad about that. I&#8217;m getting the phone but am no stoked on the glass back at all. I just need to be a bit more careful than I am with my GNex. Being a cloud fan, I already store all my pictures and music through Google so the size capacity isn&#8217;t a huge deal for myself. But for 300 bucks, it doesn&#8217;t get any better. Not even close. If they wanted to charge 600 bucks, I imagine this phone would have everything people are complaining about, but they&#8217;d sell about 1/4 of the amount that they&#8217;re going to.</p>
<p>glass front and back,  now who is copying who?</p>
<p>My windows are made with glass, I don&rsquo;t know who I copied but it was a good decision. Still can&rsquo;t see why you&rsquo;d want a glass back, it&rsquo;s just an extra thing to break</p>
<p>NO!</p>
<p>The best Android phone is the Galaxy Note 2.</p>
<p>Seriously though, after reading a great deal of these comments, I think the only way to appease these crazy The Verge-is-an-Apple-pro-website is to give this phone a 9.8, and demote the iPad mini to a 7 because it&rsquo;s screen totally sucks and it has a terrible processor.</p>
<p>s/</p>
<p>Well, fuck. After the 920 being my next, this just made everything so much harder..</p>
<p>This phone is disappointing in the end. lack of lte, less sturdy then Galaxy Nexus, and design is pale. I shall have to stick with my Galaxy Nexus for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the US, a flagship phone without LTE is like a muscle car with no wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A better one would be, &ldquo;In the US, a flagship phone without LTE is like an 18 wheeler on a 4 cylinder engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your analogy is more appropriate, though I disagree that lack of LTE is a big deal.</p>
<p>Why not get one and switch to T-Mobile?  Are you married to AT&T or something?</p>
<p>Also wifi.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the lack of LTE is a non-issue and hardly a deal-breaker.  <strong>Especially</strong> since LTE networks are deliberately incompatible to foster continued carrier lock-in for new phones.  A phone like the Nexus 4 sold at a reasonable markup is there worst nightmare.  Good phones sold at reasonable markups would force the carriers to compete on price and coverage alone, commoditizing their pipes.</p>
<p>I think the FTC ought to step in and usher that process along, but I&rsquo;m glad a company like Google has the wherewithal to take them on.</p>
<p>It might not be for you, but you can bet that carriers will be advertising LTE pretty heavily and this phone will be left out of all that.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus was on Verizon and it was a nightmare.</p>
<p>is that the gas station in greenpoint brooklyn on mcguinness and kinda by greenpoint ave? neato.</p>
<p>Also neato phone.</p>
<p>The best looking Nexus yet and the screen looks good to me from the photos.  Only doubt is the performance, such as with demanding games, UI, browser, etc., as my experience with Crapdragon has been sub-par as compared Exynos.</p>
<p>Verge, can you do a more thorough performance comparison of Nexus 4 and Galaxy Note II?</p>
<p>Really? wasn&#8217;t the S4 dual core already more or less on par with the Exynos? The quad core S4 Pro should be much faster than the Exynos. Even if it runs at a slightly higher clock speed.</p>
<p>The verge really needs to get some reviewers outside of New York city, because they don&rsquo;t seem to realize that the experience in New York is not representative of the rest of the country not to mention the world.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still wondering what they are doing that 5mbps is so annoyingly slow. I think you can even stream hd over 5mbps, not to mention that I&rsquo;ve seen many many people outside the crowded NY market that get well over 20mbps on tmobile&rsquo;s 42mbps HSPA+.</p>
<p>I understand that it&rsquo;s an annoyance that it doesn&rsquo;t have LTE which is a fairly common tech in new phones, but I think the prompt updates to new versions of android far outweigh the lack of LTE. Not everyone (read almost noone) gets new phones every week like theverge reviewers do.</p>
<p>I have 6Mbps internet connection at home (maxed out on ADSL). For the life of me I wouldn&#8217;t know why I&#8217;d need to go faster. Youtube runs fine (even in HD) en websites too</p>
<p><strong>Cannot wait to get my Nexus 4. </strong></p>
<p>This is the device I have been waiting for, at <em>$350USD</em> this is simply the best unlocked device and maybe for the first time I will have extra money to buy some accessories like the wireless charging device etc.</p>
<p>I purchase almost all my phones off contract and usually spend around $600-$750 on brand new unlocked devices so this is awesome.</p>
<p>I am usually in wifi most of the day and my city does not have LTE deployed as yet on AT&T.<br />
 I would also sacrifice ultra fast download speeds for better battery life anyday.</p>
<p>Thanks for not using Flash on the video.</p>
<p>This phone is for T-Mobile.</p>
<p>In other news, Apple stock tanking, Android commands 75% of the smartphone market and sky is blue.</p>
<p>Glass back that easily fractures.  Non-removable battery.  Non-expandable storage.  Unimpressive battery life (per anandtech).  Overheats and throttles back when pushing it (per anandtech).  Integrated storage capacity too small.  No LTE!!!  The only thing this phone has going for it is the supreme functionality of Android 4.2.   I doubt we&rsquo;ll see a big splash on the Android front, in terms of a complete package that has something for everyone, until the Galaxy S4 is introduced in February at MWC.</p>
<p>Its a nice phone in deed, but I do also have the wonder how they they got the idea to put a glass as a backpiece? Have to say have they not seen the iPhone 4/4a? And have to agree with the reviewer about that LTE isnt on the device. LTE is widespread in Sweden as well. So yes its a bad desicion. but i guess Europe as a whole hasnt came thus far as US and Sweden on this matter.</p>
<p>Stop complaining about the score people! Sheesh, it&rsquo;s all subjective so get over it. Who cares if it has glass front and back? Your phone is gonna break if you drop it either way, so don&rsquo;t drop it. <br />
I have an iPhone 5 but will get this to play with Android (selling my tablet to &ldquo;justify&rdquo; two phones). <br />
Joshua &ndash; you wouldn&rsquo;t want to compare the screen with the One X would you? The One X has the nicest screen I&rsquo;ve seen on any phone, images on the screen look like they&rsquo;ve been painted on top of the glass. Does this compare?</p>
<p>Josh dropped the phone and the back broke but not the front.  Had it not been made of glass, it wouldn&#8217;t have.  So no, it&#8217;s not going to break &#8220;either way&#8221;.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t really see the obsession with LTE. This has nothing to do with me wanting this phone or anything, I just don&rsquo;t get it. Or rather, I don&rsquo;t see how someone could describe the lack of LTE &ldquo;alarming.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll hit your cap in 15 minutes if you &ldquo;really&rdquo; use it, otherwise, a decent HSPA+ network is more than capable.</p>
<p>What if you aren&#8217;t capped?  Sprint still sells unlimited data plans and a lot of Verizon customers are on unlimited data contracts.  The S4 Plus and S4 Pro phones are actually battery efficient on LTE too so why not offer it?  And regardless of all that, LTE is blazing fast and it makes a phone much more usable when you&#8217;re mobile.  For example, on my Galaxy S3, I can tell the phone to navigate somewhere and it will very quickly launch maps and all the data required to render the map image will be downloaded nearly instantly at 10Mbit+ speeds.  On 3G you may as well get comfortable because it&#8217;s going to take a minute.  Or another good example is bar code scanning for deals when out shopping.  You scan a bar code and it will launch and load a page instantly so you can do more scans in less time.  Bar code scanning for deals on 3G is a pain in the ass.  Streaming music and movie services such as Google Play and Netflix are also big winners on LTE phones.  For me personally, I will never go back to 3G and Verizon will have to pry my unlimited data contract from my cold dead hands.</p>
<p>And the biggest question of all is:  Who cares if you are capped by a data tier?  Sign up for a 4GB tier and you&#8217;ve got over 100MB a day to use up.  That will pretty much give you the freedom to do whatever you want except stream movies.  At least give the consumer the option to use it.  A lack of standard options is commonly referred to as a compromise.</p>
<p>You fail to mention one thing in your entire post: cost. You want to keep your unlimited plan and still have the latest phone? That&#8217;s at least $600. Oh, how much is your unlimited data plan? Mine is $85/month for 450 minutes with unlimited text and data. That&#8217;s the cheapest you can go too. A tiered data plan at 4 GB/month? Well you&#8217;re forced into a Share Everything plan now and that STARTS at 90$/month for 1 GB of data. It&#8217;s $110/month for 4 GB of data. It&#8217;s way too expensive. LTE speeds are nice but not worth it. I&#8217;m switching to T-Mobile for the Nexus 4, lower costs, and HSPA+.</p>
<p>wow, in my europe country unlimited text and calls is around 12$ and data is 2 GB for 10$/10 GB for 20$. (3G)</p>
<p>I dig the price and it looks solid too.  I don&rsquo;t see any real deal breakers here.</p>
<p>I see an obvious &#8220;breaker&#8221;.  Twice as many as most phones, in fact&#8230;</p>
<p>Shut up and take my money. This is my next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nexus 4 is a handsome &mdash; if relatively uninspired &mdash; device. Since it&rsquo;s taking most of its design cues from the previous generation Nexus&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t want to bring iphone into this but the first thought I had was &ndash; wasn&rsquo;t iphone5 exactly matching this comment? Why wasn&rsquo;t there something about this in the iphone5 review.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s such an enormous variety of different Android phone styles and designs &#8211; even among the Nexus line &#8211; that for a device to so closely resemble its predecessor is unusual.  For an Apple product to closely resemble the previous year&#8217;s product isn&#8217;t unusual at all, so it&#8217;s not considered in inherently bad thing.</p>
<p>Also, while the iPhone 5 did closely resemble the iPhone 4/4S in style, it did address its predecessor&#8217;s glaring weakness: the glass back.</p>
<p>That has to be the dumbest argument ever. So because they made the same &#8220;mistake&#8221;/ &#8220;faux pas&#8221; in the past it&#8217;s now ok to do so yet again? if anything they should be penalized extra for remaining uninspired.</p>
<p>Crazy how AMOLED went from the Bee&rsquo;s Knees to Meh in just a couple years.</p>
<p>The Nexus is the only Android phone I&rsquo;d ever go back to but the lack of LTE would stop me.</p>
<p>AMOLED was never a good thing in practice, it has too many flaws and weaknesses.  And it doesn&#8217;t help that it&#8217;s so closely associated with PenTile.</p>
<p>Amoled is amazing. The blacks were nowhere near as good on LCD back then. LCD has caught up though and now the disadvantages of Amoled are not outweighing the advantage of the superior blacks, better contrast and wider color gamut.</p>
<p>No  blog or tech website has talked about that there&#8217;s support for Mira cast wireless displays which seems to be like apple airplay</p>
<p>Miracast works with AirPlay and WiDi.</p>
<p>&#8220;extremely helpful / somewhat creepy predictive search thing&#8221;<br />
That&#8217;s the best description of Google Now I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>Like, I&#8217;ve had a really hard time explaining google now to people.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t much care about final score, but calling the reception/call quality top notch and then giving it a six is weird.</p>
<p>I guess that section includes the lack of &#8220;LTE&#8221;  not that it should effect it &#8220;THAT&#8221; much. maybe 8/10 &#8230;</p>
<p>Mouth was too close to the mic in the video review :/</p>
<p>I wish HTC J could make babies with a pure Google experience</p>
<p>so basically&#8230; LTE aside best phone out there.</p>
<p>So for us UK users its a no brainer!</p>
<p>Yeah, Netherlands here. Couldn&#8217;t care a hoot about LTE either. As does probably well over 90% of the potential buyers.</p>
<p>Personally I&#8217;m a bit miffed about the glass back though. That&#8217;s just such a stupid thing to do. Especially when it breaks already when &#8220;accidentily&#8221; dropped during a review &#8230;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what Google wanted me to be until I held this phone.</p>
<p>I wanted to be euphonious, but I was cacophonous.</p>
<p>Holding this phone, I am adorable.  I am all the promise of the nexus realized in a package that exceeds expectations.  I&#8217;m put together beautifully.  I&#8217;m a perfect piece of ass.</p>
<p>Nexus.</p>
<p>Number Four.</p>
<p>You definitely NEED a case to protect this glass back of this phone.</p>
<p>if the back of the iPhone 4S was broken while reviewing will you give it a lower score. because you wasn&#8217;t concerned by the glass of the iPhone</p>
<p>Although this review was generally positive, I wished the author would have stated the reasons why Google chose not to include LTE.  The major reason has to do with Verizon and how they handle phones that are allowed to use their networks.</p>
<p>Although LTE is free of certification by the carrier for any phone maker to make a phone for, Verizon&#8217;s CDMA network does not work that way. Any phone that is made to work on Verizon&#8217;s CDMA network are forced to go through Verizon&#8217;s certification process, which includes updates to the software on the phone. And even though this would be a 4G LTE phone, it still relies on CDMA to function properly and so would still have to go through the CDMA certification process.</p>
<p>They tried doing this with the Galaxy Nexus and as you can see the wait times for roll out and updates on the CDMA versions of the phones were extremely long. Also the software was not pure Android as Verizon was able to put their software on the phone due to the certification process. So it was either compromise the Nexus experience with the Nexus 4 and allow Verizon to bog down updates and rollouts or just choose not to support the Verizon network and have full control of the phone.</p>
<p>They chose to nix Verizon support and in turn have nixed the biggest LTE market that would have made putting 4G LTE a worthy enough feature on the phone. AT&amp;T has a rather small LTE network and adding in the extra cost, which would not be subsidized by AT&amp;T, just didn&#8217;t warrant the increase of the cost to customers for such a small percentage of people that would benefit from it. Until the Nexus brand can be big enough to force carriers to not touch their devices like Apple has been able to do, they have no choice but to not include LTE. Once Verizon goes all LTE though, then they can proceed with an LTE device that will truly be pure Android.</p>
<p>It also has no LTE because this is meant to be a worldwide phone and it&#8217;s not yet been established on what frequencies LTE is going to operate in different countries.  Similar to how virtually all countries have settled on using 800/850/1700/1900/2100 for HSPA, there will grow to be some consensus on what frequencies will be used for LTE.</p>
<p>Currently it&#8217;s a total crapshoot.  These frequncies are already in use or reserved for LTE in various countries: 700,800,850,900,1400,1500,1700,1800,1900,2100,2300,2500,2600&#8230; and there are more proposed and being bid on.  Just try making a &#8220;world phone&#8221; that operates on that many frequencies, and try justifying the cost of that when almost none of those are actually being built out yet.</p>
<p>NO LTE, Fragile, No CDMA VERSION, Not buying.</p>
<p>CDMA is third world technology, get over it.</p>
<p>the greatest phone on earth i must say&#8230;<br />
and its coming 8 days after my birthday!!!</p>
<p>wow, thanks for giving away the score of the review during the spec portion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel any hesitation in saying that the pure Android 4.2 experience is — at least in my estimation — the most advanced mobile operating system on the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>::::: Congratulations, you&#8217;ve broke the norm of being an elitist blogger, yet admitting it.</p>
<p>Good Luck Josh</p>
<p>what the hell happened to your voice at the camera review part?? was someone squeezing your balls?</p>
<p>I for one am definitely getting this phone, for the price its a winner, I couldn&#8217;t care less about LTE,  I can wait a few more seconds for football scores.</p>
<p>A 10 in Software? OK Josh, you just made it official, Android is perfect and complete, right? Right?</p>
<p>I love Android, but this should not have happened.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best currently available, which makes it a 10.</p>
<p>Comprehension FAIL.</p>
<p>android 4.2 have amazing things</p>
<p>1) The camera user interface is the best i have seen &#8212; nice job Google.  I want that on my iPhone (Apple, please take note).  Duarte and team have done it again.</p>
<p>2) iPhone 4 &amp; 4S have glass backs but I can walk into any Apple store, pay $30 and get a cracked back replaced.  Where do you take the Nexus 4 for replacement glass?  This could be an issue for some.</p>
<p> 3) I said that when I bought the iPhone 4S it would be the last non-LTE phone I would buy in the USA.  I felt that LTE coverage was hitting the point where living without LTE would be a big deal, so I know where Josh is coming from.  LTE can be done today with decent battery life, so we know this is more about Google &amp; Verizon butting heads because they are competing in the mobile wallet space while partnering in selling phones and devices.</p>
<p>All-in-all, I think this is a pretty good review.</p>
<p>If  you take out insurance on your device. The glass can be replaced. Trust me I have damaged many phones.</p>
<p>How much does that cost?  What percent of the total cost of a $300/$350 phone is going to just be to protect the retarded glass back?</p>
<p>So, The Samsung Galaxy S III scored 8.5 on the Verge.<br />
The HTC One X scored 8.6. <br />
The LG Optimus G (ATT version) scored 8.2, 8.3 for the Sprint version.<br />
Enter iPhone 5, Verge score = 8.8.</p>
<p>Now, the Verge score for the Nexus 4 is 8.3 with &#8220;Easily the best Android phone in the market&#8221; in the conclusion! Would someone hold me?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/products/compare/6274/5588/5236/6218/6002/6116" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/products/compare/6274/5588/5236/6218/6002/6116</a></p>
<p>bad materials<br />
no lte<br />
bad camera (yes it is not 8, probably 6)</p>
<p>Bad materials? LOL!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t blame google though.  They had to keep the costs down.  It&#8217;s a cheap android dev phone.  It&#8217;s only claim to fame is direct google updates.</p>
<p>his point was that every review seems  to love the build quality.</p>
<p>How old are those reviews, remind me please?</p>
<p>Y U NO NOT SERIOUS?</p>
<p>Context. </p>
<p>I will be honest since getting my iPhone 5 I can&#8217;t imagine not having LTE.  I think Josh is right LTE is the norm now.  Oh and BTW looks like The iPhone 5 is the most highly rated Phone on The Verge ;). AWESOME!</p>
<p>And the iP5 you&#8217;re not trading LTE with lower battery life (SGS3 or One X) or CPU/GPU power (NA SGS3) for less.  In fact if you read Anandtech preview of the N4 and N10, even the new Cortex A15 in the N10 is hardly quantum leaping the A6.  And the iPhone despite all this still last 8-10 hours a charge and weighs a scant 112g.  That,  in my book, is progress.</p>
<p>How much does it cost?</p>
<p>Do you took in consideration the HUGE difference in the number of pixels an iP5 has to render in contrast to the N10 ? Anandtech benchs were total crap. It&#8217;s like trying to move a car and a truck with the same 100HP engine.</p>
<p>are total crap* Edit button plz &#8212;&#8217;</p>
<p>There are off-screen benchmarks rendered at the same resolution&#8230;</p>
<p>i have a feeling they will release a LTE version of this phone</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll probably release a model with North American HSPA/LTE bands and 32 GB of storage at some point, maybe in 3-6 months, but I doubt they&#8217;ll make Verizon/Sprint models.  I hope not, anyway.</p>
<p>3-6 months would be my guess as well, look at their other devices. they are going to release another nexus 7 with standard 32 GB of storage.+/- 6 months after the original release.</p>
<p>I though Duarte (or someone else from Google)  hinted that they had no plans to do so. Obviously though, if they find it necessary to go after a bit more market share then the could easily add it. The LG Optimus G has LTE.</p>
<p>Or perhaps they are hoping that Verizon will cave and let the Nexus on the LTE network without demanding they get to screw up the device and the updates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an iPhone devotee with an iPhone 5. I&#8217;ve been considering purchasing this to use from time to time. Idk if I will since I&#8217;ve gotten use to LTE speeds. It is a nicely designed device though. +1 to google.</p>
<p>Excellent review Josh. This is my next!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MBdHL.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>And this is how the chart looked before WP fan sites alerted their users let TheVerge know which phone <strong>they</strong> like:<br />
<img src="http://wmpoweruser.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/image71.png" /></p>
<p>Odd how just the Lumia and 8X bars have grown since &#8230;</p>
<p>Nexus 4 is a great phone, looks beautifull but I&#8217;m still perfectly happy with my white Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>You do realize that you gave 8 for the camera and gave 8 also for the Lumia 920? That the iPhone has had a glass back for 2 generations and that you never did so much fuss around it? That most reviewers on The Verge spend 1 year with a phone or less, while the average consumer spends 2 years and that having stock Android is a real advantage over the S3?</p>
<p>Reviewers on The Verge are really starting to be clueless and annoying.</p>
<p><strong>The passage of time and the progress of technology are important factors.</strong></p>
<p>The iPhone 4/4S were, at the time, about the best smartphones you could buy in a general sense.  They didn&#8217;t have Android&#8217;s flexibility, but on the other hand Android was still only at 2.3 (Gingerbread) at the time&#8230; plus most Android devices weren&#8217;t especially attractive.</p>
<p>So in light of this, the back being made of glass was an important but relatively small weakness.  It should be noted that absolutely no other device has ever had a glass back and it seems the reason is obvious, especially in light of how many shattered iPhones there were.  To use a glass back with full knowledge of how demonstrably impractical it is, and for the reviewer to have accidentally shattered his during his brief review period, is a very bad thing.</p>
<p>Also, while the Lumia 920 has good low-light performance, it&#8217;s not a standout otherwise (IIRC), making it remarkable but not truly &#8220;superior&#8221; compared to the excellent overall cameras on the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S III.</p>
<p>As for The Verge&#8217;s reviewers being annoying, I would say the children commenting here are a bigger issue.</p>
<p>4s was not the best smartphone of its time and the reviewers do not know how to rate products when they give the ipad mini a 9.0.</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus. Now I feel inferior.</p>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;m amazed at how well the Galaxy Nexus s holding up. We had a HTC ChaCha and HTC Sensation wich both fell by the wayside.</p>
<p>Still I&#8217;d love to het my hands on the Nexus 4 or the Galaxy Note II.</p>
<p>A 6 on reception/call quality? Is that because of lack of LTE?!? Because nowhere did I read that the reception/call quality was bad, in fact I read call quality was good and reception wasn&#8217;t complained about&#8230; If it is because of a lack of LTE I think that should be bumped to 7 minimum! I&#8217;m sorry but in the UK LTE has just started to roll out and won&#8217;t be big until next year, and on most contracts/deals 5gb is the maximum you can get so what is the point of super fast speeds if you get hardly any data usage allowance to use it on. &#8220;Look at me, I can watch youtube videos and load pages superfast but only for half a month (If that) when I&#8217;ve used all my data&#8230;&#8221; Ludicrous!<br />
I am thrilled to upgrade my iPhone 4 (Never damaged the phone even though that has glass front and back) to this because it&#8217;s only 16gb (Like my iPhone) and it&#8217;s £239!!! £239 for a flagship phone specced better than mine, better than 4S and better than 5 (in some aspects, beaten by the 5 in others) and costs half as much&#8230; that&#8217;s a no brainer!</p>
<p>An 8 for the camera?</p>
<p>A phone camera that might&#8217;ve been a 9 or 10 is now a 7 or 8 in light of the supposedly amazing new Nokia smartphone cameras.</p>
<p>The new camera UI and software on this device changes everything.</p>
<p>I honestly thought I would never even consider an Android device until this thing came along&#8230;  I love the whole idea behind unlocked, high quality, and reasonably priced devices.  I hope this is where the future is heading.  Well done Google&#8230;</p>
<p>Yep, a future where companies don&#8217;t make any money selling products.  Sounds pretty cool.</p>
<p>Apple could sell an iPhone 5 for 350-400 unlocked and still make a lot of profit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a future where companies don&#8217;t make any money, it&#8217;s a future where companies don&#8217;t overcharge.</p>
<p>LTE murdered this phone in the states. I&#8217;m on Verizon and I was really looking forward to this for months. Seeing as I won&#8217;t even be able to use it at all is a big let down :(</p>
<p>Get on a network that doesn&#8217;t use third-world technology.</p>
<p>That would be <em>fantastic</em> if some could. Some of us live out her&#8217; wher&#8217; ther&#8217; ain&#8217;t no GSM carriers. Just Verizon and U.S. Cellular &lt;&#8212;&#8212; Wisconsin.</p>
<p>now that i look at the scores again the call quality/reception is worrisome, more so than storage or LTE</p>
<p>Call quality/reception is grouped in with its lack of LTE.  In the review he specifically states that it has good reception and call quality.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bit confusing then. I missed the remark in the review, but the poor score had me worried.</p>
<p>$650 Lumia 920 = 7.9<br />
$300/$350 Nexus 4 = 8.3</p>
<p>Hurr hurr hurr.</p>
<p>Would Nokia actually be that dumb that they would try to sell that Lumia at that price?</p>
<p>Apparently google is..</p>
<p>well, if andy rubin&#8217;s was damaged, who are we to say undamaged phones are the norm?!!1</p>
<p>I would buy this phone in a heartbeat. I don&#8217;t really care about LTE. Of course it&#8217;s nice to have LTE, but it&#8217;s not a deal breaker for me. I am more worried about the glass back though. But, definitely my next phone.</p>
<p>Great phone, I would definitely buy one. In Brazil the lack of LTE is not a big problem.</p>
<p>Take my money! Now!!!</p>
<p>BUY A NEW MICROPHONE! The more expensive the better. Your video quality, editing and the overall experience watching your review videos is awesome. But the voice over audio quality blows and I can&#8217;t stand listening to it. Thanks.</p>
<p>I gotta say, this is the first thing that has really made me consider switching from my iPhone, but unfortunately, 16GB just isn&#8217;t enough. Sigh&#8230;</p>
<p>I wonder: is the washed out screen is something that could be corrected with a software update?</p>
<p>I have an HTC One X and the only thing that could keep me from getting a different phone is downgrading from its beautiful screen.</p>
<p>Other reviews praise the screen including color reproduction. However, the review units seem to be pre-production units so some variance is to be expected.</p>
<p>The &#8220;washed out&#8221; screen could be one of two things:</p>
<p>1) fixable with a software update (or custom rom)</p>
<p>2) simply be producing color more accurately than phones typically have</p>
<p>Most phones have severe color oversaturation to make the display look &#8220;vibrant&#8221; to stupid people.</p>
<p>Unbelievable was the iPhone 4/4s slammed for not being LTE? I don&#8217;t believe they were, not sure how it just becomes unacceptable now that the iPhone 5 was released.  I have always said that once a LTE iPhone 5 was released you would see Josh T start his path back to an iPhone.</p>
<p>The Nexus was always the thing the Josh T apologists would use to show he was an Apple Fanboy.  I&#8217;m not sure how many times I saw statements like &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t just like Apple did you see the review he gave the Nexus!?!?&#8221;.  Josh just embrace your fanboyism for Apple so that people reading your reviews can at least understand that as they read your reviews where you drone on about flushed buttons for 3 minutes of a 6 minute review.</p>
<p>Are you a time traveler?  LTE barely existed when the iPhone 4/4S were released.</p>
<p>It still barely exists today</p>
<p>LTE was announced by Verizon on March 17, 2011.  iPhone 4s was launched October 2011.  So yes you were correct about the 4, but certainly by the time the 4s came out there were plenty of Android phones with LTE.  There were plenty of rumors stating the 4s would have LTE which it didnt and should have been slammed for based on the logic of this review.</p>
<p>Josh decries the phone for having an &#8220;alarming lack of LTE&#8221;, then goes on to complain that it doesn&#8217;t take enough risks in one of the next paragraphs. Selling it unlocked and for such a low price is a risk. Even from a design standpoint, a non-removable glass backing is pretty unconventional for any Android device. This is the biggest risk Google has taken with a Nexus phone, yet &#8220;even HTC&#8217;s One X seems to be taking more risks than this phone&#8221;? Sorry Josh, it&#8217;s a great review otherwise, but it&#8217;s just not true that Google isn&#8217;t taking any risks with making this their next Nexus device.</p>
<p>Lacking LTE or having a glass back aren&#8217;t &#8220;risks&#8221; in the sense he means.  One kind of &#8220;risk&#8221; is to make compromises and calculated decisions that have immediate payoffs in the form of things like reduced manufacturing costs or easier software updates.</p>
<p>Another kind of &#8220;risk&#8221; is to make a huge bet on something that could make or break a product or even a company &#8211; like Google betting so heavily on G+, buying Motorola, completely shifting the Android design language in ICS, Nokia deciding to double down on Windows Phone, Microsoft shifting so heavily to &#8220;Metro&#8221; design for Windows 8, Intel trying to promote Ultrabooks, and Valve launching their Steam service.  Any one of these decisions could prove to be a severe setback.</p>
<p>Nexus 4 isn&#8217;t a very &#8220;risky&#8221; product in this sense.  It ticks all the right boxes and omits one single feature (LTE) that isn&#8217;t properly standardized or in wide use outside the US&#8230; hardly a risk, and it allows them to sell one single model to the whole world.  It also uses a glass back which has proven to be a bad idea in the past, but this isn&#8217;t a &#8220;risk&#8221;, it&#8217;s just boneheaded.  The glass back, to me, is the biggest thing keeping me from wanting to buy this device on release day.</p>
<p>Everyone likes to see companies take big risks on products but as the word implies, it doesn&#8217;t always pay off.  Look at the Nexus Q, or Google&#8217;s attempt to sell the Nexus One direct to consumers.  The sort of risk Josh might&#8217;ve been hoping for would be to do something huge, like implement a skinning and customization system that allows users, carriers, and manufacturers to change the appearance of devices without it interfering with updates.</p>
<p>If anything, the risk Google&#8217;s taking here to possibly alienate all their so-called &#8220;partners&#8221; which seem to have succeeded only in fragmenting Android and hurting its reputation.  A brand new, high-end phone for $300/$350 off-contract is completely unprecedented.</p>
<p>Great phone for world travellers with lots of SIMs, device is  quite cheap unlocked. For all others, not so much.</p>
<p>$400 unlocked price itself is enough to give it a 9.5/10 in my book.</p>
<p>it´s 349 for the 16gb version and 299 for 8 gb.</p>
<p>Good point, you&#8217;d expect the price to reflect in the score. It&#8217;s the best phone and it costs half of what others are/will be charging. It should get a score of 16.6!</p>
<p>What is the big deal with LTE unless you are tethering devices and you do not have cable modem then yeah I get it.  HSPA+ is fantastic when I am in Seattle or Portland I get 9Mbps to 15Mbps.  For checking email and downloading a work doc/pdf or getting a file from gdrive the speed is just fine.</p>
<p>It boils down to:<br />
<blockquote>Android may still have a slightly steeper learning curve than iOS or Windows Phone, but what you get in return for a little bit of extra effort is phenomenal. In just over a year, the OS has gone from a nice-but-flawed experiment to a sleek, sophisticated, and incredibly smart platform. I don&#8217;t feel any hesitation in saying that the pure Android 4.2 experience is — at least in my estimation — the most advanced mobile operating system on the market.</blockquote></p>

<p>I am getting this and probably the 8X for my sis for christmas so I can keep up to date with WP8,</p>
<p>8.3 doesn&#8217;t say anything. If you read the review, the phone does so much better than that. If the only &#8216;bad&#8217; thing is the lack of LTE, I&#8217;m sold. I&#8217;m fine with 5 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up. Great review!</p>
<p>The back is made of <strong>glass</strong>.  Apple more than demonstrated that this is a terrible idea and for Google to to just willfully ignore reality is inexcusable.</p>
<p>Duarte claimed they had fixed the breakage issue by designing the housing to protect the glass. So &#8230; they failed at that then.</p>
<p>Hilarious to see you children get worked up over scores every time a review posts. Josh likes the phone &#8211; take his judgment into account when you&#8217;re shopping.</p>
<p>Lack of LTE is what&#8217;s keeping this from being my next phone. May hate Verizon, but I love their service.</p>
<p>I think Josh felt betrayed by Google with the Nexus 4 having no LTE. When reviewing the iPhone 5 Josh said &#8220;But there&#8217;s also another segment of the market, of which I consider myself a part.&#8221; &#8230;. &#8220;For that segment, I think the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 fall short.&#8221; <br />
But now he is going back to the iPhone just because of no LTE.</p>
<p>First world problems. :)</p>
<p>This is definitely my next.</p>
<p>I like how you change the font to match the operating system. Did it with this and the Winddoes Phone reviews.</p>
<p>Ok. Josh, your constant complaining regarding the back made of glass is beyond hypocritical:</p>
<blockquote> The glass back — while incredibly prone to shattering on impact — feels as sleek and sexy as ever. The metal antenna and solid, machined buttons feel high-end, expensive even. If this were a car, it would be a Mercedes.</blockquote>
<p>Lack of LTE:</p>
<blockquote>The lack of LTE, a larger display, or a new design may put off some buyers, but that won&#8217;t change the fact that the 4S is a force to be reckoned with. </blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the scores average to 8.5 and the fact you gave it 6 for reception and call quality is a joke, and the fact that is low price seemed not to make any difference is also a joke.</p>
<p><strong>The past is not the present.</strong></p>
<p>Since the iPhone 4 came out and everyone shattered their phones, it&#8217;s become obvious that glass is NOT a good protective material.  For Google and LG to blatantly ignore something that&#8217;s so well-known is just plain stupid.</p>
<p>At the time the 4S came out, LTE wasn&#8217;t as widespread as it is now.  More than a year has passed.</p>
<p>Final scores aren&#8217;t necessarily an average.  A reviewer&#8217;s overall opinion counts for something as well, and a striking weakness in one area is more important than all the stats being slightly lower.  Josh feels that the lack of LTE is a major weakness, which overrides some of the phone&#8217;s other qualities.</p>
<p>IMHO it deserved to be docked more heavily for the glass back and less heavily for the LTE but I still think the score is fair.</p>
<p>(can&#8217;t edit)</p>
<p>For goodness sake, he&#8217;s had the phone presumably for less than a week and already shattered the back, do you think that&#8217;s something he can just ignore?</p>
<p>Well, even Nilay laughed at him, because he has shattered the back of the iPhone 4/4S many, many, many times&#8230; but you didn&#8217;t hear him complain about that, did you?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s inconsistent, stop trying to defend the indefensible.</p>
<p>Their scoring system is meaningless. I don&#8217;t want to repeat it, but yeah, that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Was LTE in New York City any slower when the iPhone 4S was released? Oh, yeah, not it wasn&#8217;t. Somehow LTE wasn&#8217;t important until the iPhone 5 was launched, now it&#8217;s a critical feature (and, let&#8217;s be honest, it&#8217;s only critical in a part, not even the entire, US, and mostly still irrelevant all around the globe).</p>
<p>The comments about reviews over the last few days are hilarious. Like, Josh is obviously an American, living in America&#8230;so the review is based on that painfully obvious fact. HE does mention data speeds abroad, but if you&#8217;re expecting him to cater his review to everyone situation it would be a 1000 pages long.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny that you have to explain to people things like the review lives in America, or that it&#8217;s his opinion, or that review vary from person to person, or that it&#8217;s subjective. Comments are the worst corner of the internet. I&#8217;m a moron for reading them but I guess I wish for actual thoughtful dialogue sometimes.</p>
<p>Would this work on Metro PCS?</p>
<p>Great review. The lack of LTE is extremely annoying but considering I&#8217;ve been using a GNex on AT&amp;T for the last year and have not experienced LTE before, this phone is still an upgrade for me in almost every way. Now I just have to convince the wifey to buy me one for Christmas.</p>
<p>Also sorry for the grammatical errors. I was typing quickly and didn&#8217;t edit. I&#8217;m part of the problem.</p>
<p>Does this bad boy use a regular SIM card or Micro-SIM?</p>
<p>I wish he would&#8217;ve done a speed test on AT&amp;T &amp; T-Mobile. I&#8217;m sure someone in the office had a T-Mobile SIM.</p>
<p>Where did they get the wallpaper that is on the nexus 4? I really want it.</p>
<p>You can get the full system dump (or just the wallpapers separately) here: <a href="http://www.androidtaskforce.com/2012/11/01/download-lg-nexus-4-system-dump/" target="_blank">http://www.androidtaskforce.com/2012/11/01/download-lg-nexus-4-system-dump/</a></p>
<p>Still can&#8217;t believe the reviews here. I am in no way a fanboy of any of the platforms, but clearly the Verge is. After reading this and the Lumia 920 review, you can see what platform they favor. The ONLY thing lacking on the Lumia 920 is the marketplace which is getting better all the time. However, lack of LTE, washed out screen should weigh in heavier than the Ecosystem. You can ALWAYS improve the apps on the Windows marketplace, but you can&#8217;t force LTE or a better screen on a phone.</p>
<p>Finally someone sane! I can&#8217;t stand the different tribes of fan boyish comments. Just want consistency in reviews. If there&#8217;s going to be a score system, at least weigh the scores properly. It would b interesting to see what scores the hardware get if marketplaces were ignored or treated as equal over all platforms &#8211; giving a better sence of hardware quality instead off just app count beating all competition. I think the iPhone 5 is a brilliant device, but is the 920 &#8216;worse&#8217; JUST because there are less apps?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t a 68 / 80 an 8.5? Or is there some additional reviewer real world experience adjustment built in?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s telling that with a good score in reception, this phone could have been very close to a 9&#8230;realm of the epic game-changer.  Can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on one.</p>
<p>Indeed. It averages 8.5, but Joshua wasn&#8217;t happy enough with a laughable 6 in reception and call quality, he further downgraded to 8.3. In practice, he gave the Nexus 4 in call and reception for not having LTE.</p>
<p>The price obviously didn&#8217;t play any factor, nor does the fact that both the Galaxy Nexus GSM and the Verizon Galaxy Nexus, according to himself!, are only separated apart by .1 (and the only difference is LTE) or the fact the iPhone 4S got 8.6 despite LTE.</p>
<p>Is a ludidrous score, but so is The Verge entire scoring system (it&#8217;s a meaningless number arbitrary assigned by each reviewer, which gives the impression of being part of meaningful objective scale, the could just as easily replace the number by the world which merely mean &#8220;is good man&#8221; and nothing would be different).</p>
<p>Sounds like you&#8217;ve had devices you like rated poorly one too many times.  There&#8217;s no such thing as a scientific review, get over it.</p>
<p>Of course there is. How good is a screen, or how fast is a device, or how long the battery last, are all measurable.</p>
<p>But you missed the point, I&#8217;m not arguing against Josh or any reviewer in The Verge really or out there, writing a piece on how they rated their relationship with a device,  but rather in the use of a meaningless scale, to be a meaningful scale it has to be a function, even it&#8217;s a subjective scale set to measure preference.</p>
<p>The scale would make sense if we could define a function that goes from one score to reviewer, but that doesn&#8217;t happen in The Verge, because there are multiple reviewers, therefore, all scores are non-comparable between each other.</p>
<p>Moreover, since Josh is being inconsistent in how he scores stuff among himself, it doesn&#8217;t even make sense to provide a misleading chart of functions that supposedly objectively score some aspects of the phone (screen, reception, etc), but the resulting score isn&#8217;t a function over those scores (meaning they are not even fucking related).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess, and I complained about since day one, in fact, I wrote a post when The Verge had just gone up, saying their scoring system is worthless, so no at your ad hominem.</p>
<p>Of course &#8211; context for everything I suppose &#8211; someone reviewing the N4 in NY, Chicago, or another area where HSPA doesn&#8217;t cut it in 11/2012 should certainly point that out.  1, 3, 5 9, or whatever, I was just objecting to the arbitrary numbers not adding up.  As ironic as that is &#8211; haha.</p>
<p>It does seem though many reviewers, not just Josh, not just this phone, get a gadget that is nearly exactly what they want and they completely flip out because it&#8217;s missing that one potentially minuscule detail.  While there&#8217;s some level of absurdity to that, there&#8217;s also some level of humanity to it as well.  I guess I like that.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but interestingly the review doesn&#8217;t tell that the Nexus 4 processor is a quad-core. Reading the iPad Mini review and this one just makes me sad about the way reviews are made today. The lack of a deep review in this particular case  (this one looks like a sinopsis) and the enphasys on LTE is regreatable.</p>
<p>Tegra 3 is quad core but it&#8217;s still crappy.  Core count is irrelevant, what matters is user experience, and Josh said that the experience is very good and snappy.</p>
<p>Lumia 920.. Nexus 4..  Soo confused&#8230; What to buy..?</p>
<p>Pondering a similar question as I&#8217;m starting a new line soon.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you know that Apple makes a smartphone?</p>
<p>The Nexus is already a generation ahead on the S4 SOC. With the new quad core in the Nexus vs the dual core from beginning of this year which is in the Lumia. With the Nexus you also know the apps are there. You don&#8217;t have to hope and pray that they will come one day if the market WP share ever comes over 2%. Besides the Android OS being probably about half a decade ahead of WP.</p>
<p>For a WP device I&#8217;d wait till the start of 2013 when the quad core models should be arriving. Including probably some software refinements to get the kinks out of the new OS. With Microsoft you never buy the first release. Always wait for service pack one,.</p>
<p>emphasis</p>
<p>I want..but need LTE so Galaxy III</p>
<p>In the iPhone 4s review Josh states that the glass back feels sleak an sexy but it&#8217;s a negative here.  So with the iPhone he&#8217;s willing to overlook the fact that it&#8217;s pron to shattering but  can not over look it here.<br />
also here is what the speeds were for the iPhone 4 s he tested &quot; I never saw my downstream peak above 2.2Mbps, while my upstream held solid at around 1.5Mbps&quot;</p>
<p>I always love the two set of rules for Apple and everyone else.</p>
<p>w</p>
<p>The iPhone combines the texture of stainless steel and glass- the materials used in glass structures.  The nexus 4 combines plastic and glass- the same materials on the Samsung galaxy.  The huge difference in feel and look.</p>
<p>The ruberized plastic is for better ergonomics. The iPhone 4(s)  was awkward to hold and slippery. My dads iPhone keeps sliding off the couch all the time.</p>
<p>Function &gt; Looks</p>
<p>this fools rate the camera same as the lumia 920&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh my god your right. O.o</p>
<p>you&#8217;re*</p>
<p>So it probably is. He could directly compare the two.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great phone for Russia, because we have LTE only in Moscow at speed 11,5/10 mbps and the same speed at hspa. We just need to wait shipping, I think about two days after EU release at price 400$ in Moscow. I&#8217;ll buy one for me, one for yiunger brother  and of course one for our family polar bear.</p>
<p>I hear that Polar Bears prefer the white iPhone 5. Nexus, not so much.</p>
<p>Complete horse sh*t. Every Nexus device is a total win. Just because it doesnt have LTE? Really, LTE is so spotty everywhere,  be real. Dont hate because you dont have HSPA+42 like us in Tmo. Get a life and give credit where it is due.</p>
<p>8.3 seems low, but i am excited to see it and try it myself.</p>
<p>Like an all stereotypes about americans. All world don&#8217;t give a f**k about uploading hd-movies or the same heavi-weight sh*t on cloud via LTE. It&#8217;s like believing in american dream or middle-class in USA, which funny  on step of imagine.</p>
<p>Oh this is such BullShit.  If other countries had LTE the arguement would be that America is so far behind the times.  America is slow and low-tech.</p>
<p>But if America does have lots of LTE and other parts of the world don&#8217;t, the arguement is &#8220;You don&#8217;t need networks that fast, Americans are spoliled and lazy&#8221;</p>
<p>Honestly, that camera does not deserve an 8. Probably a 6 would be good enough. The individual scores look like worked backwards from the need to give a final score of 8.3</p>
<p>I think they accidentally LTE</p>
<p>Purely speaking about the review and the journalism behind this review when I say that this is far from your best work josh. More specifically the structure and flow of the article are completely off. Jarring even.</p>
<p>Price.<br />
Me no dispute on anything. WANT!</p>
<p>Knowing Josh, the lack of LTE had me worried, but he was able to pull off a fair and balanced review.  I&#8217;m upgrading my Gnex for the N4, I just hope I don&#8217;t drop it :\</p>
<p>So basically for everyone outside the US this is THE phone to get? At $300 unlocked seems like a good deal</p>
<p>In sweden where we can&#8217;t by from Google it&#8217;s <strong>687$ </strong> (4595 SEK)  sigh&#8230;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a scam. There is always scammers who try to rip people off with extra high prices on phones that are not available.</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 will be available for 300 euro in Europe. That&#8217;s 2580 SEK.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a scam it&#8217;s the official price from LG sweden.<br />
Stop making comments about things you don&#8217;t know anything about.</p>
<p>Nexus 7 (16 Gb) is 340$<br />
It&#8217;s because we can&#8217;t buy from Google Play here</p>
<p>Well I don&#8217;t really care if you get scammed in Sweden and are incapble of buying on a website abroad.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands we can&#8217;t buy from the play store either, but you have got to be kidding me that you cannot find the device at (or below!) play store prices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grandfathered into unlimited LTE on Verizon, which also has great coverage where I live and where I visit most often. I will be holding onto my Galaxy Nexus for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>1st world issues: amirite?</p>
<p>Given the position of Windows Phone in the market, i don&#8217;t think a Windows Phone handset will never get a fair review. come on, Lumia 920 and nexus 4 gets equivalent scores in Camera !!?? am sorry verge. i stopped trusting your reviews.</p>
<p>The Good:<br />
It&#8217;s the Newest Nexus with the best software.<br />
It&#8217;s super insanely fast<br />
Great Screen<br />
Great Battery<br />
Great Camera</p>
<p>The Bad:<br />
No LTE (Most people in America are on a carrier with LTE, Verizon, Sprint ATT)<br />
Glass Back  (Seriously WTF I thought only Apple was that stupid, and they learned from their mistake and fixed it)</p>
<p>How can you give this phone that score! People care so much about LTE. I&#8217;ve had LTE and HSPA+, and honestly there was a difference. But not big enough to make an impact on what phone I choose. HSPA+ costs so much less, and is still quick. I am on 2 bars streaming music from Play Music, and the music loads in like 2 seconds. I don&#8217;t even think it is a compromise, because it isn&#8217;t even that big of a deal for me. Plus, I got way more coverage with HSPA+. Where I got 3 bars of HSPA+, I got 1 of LTE&#8230; and the HSPA+ was faster. The phone is amazing people! Look at the specs, and it&#8217;s running 4.2! The Verge is seriously becoming weird/biased. This phone&#8217;s camera is good, but not like the Lumia 920. What is happening with you guys? Seriously, you sound like a bunch of (sorry if this is offensive in any way at all) babies. If you didn&#8217;t guess, I am picking this phone up.</p>
<p>For me, I get way better indoor reception with LTE than HSPA. Maybe its me but there is a big difference in speed. Sometimes its faster than my Comcast internet at home. IMO, the price is right but its like all the other nexus&#8217;s. Cheap build, so-so camera and no LTE&#8230;.sucks. I do like the wireless charging.</p>
<p>920 is good, but it&#8217;s a windows phone. So ya.</p>
<p>Let me just say this:  The Galaxy Nexus is a great phone.  Sure it has it&#8217;s issues (weak camera, quiet speaker, bad battery life) But other than that, it&#8217;s got the best software of anyphone available.  And when 4.2 gets released it will be running on the Galaxy Nexus within days if not hours.  <br />
The Galaxy Nexus is fast, it&#8217;s smooth, it&#8217;s powerful, and the screen is pretty damn good.  Basically what I am saying is that I&#8217;m not too upset that I am going to miss out on this phone because I&#8217;m stuck with Verizon.  I hope they do come out with a Verizon version of this phone next year or I&#8217;ll wait for my VZW contract to be up in a year and look at my options then.  But until then, I&#8217;m still loving the GNEX.</p>
<p>I mean, did you see Topolsky on that last Vergecast, he had like every phone in his hands.  The Nexus 4, the Iphone 5, the Galaxy S 3, the Galaxy Note, the Lumia.  And what is his phone?  The Galaxy freakin Nexus.</p>
<p>So, did you save your iWork docs?</p>
<p>Man am I the only one who thinks that is Ugly?  I know for you android guys its all about the numbers but shoot me with a pea gun.</p>
<p>I think the iPhone 5 is ugly. Liked the iPhone 4(s) though. To each their own.</p>
<p>I have 100Mbit at home but I&#8217;m ok with HSPA on my phone, it&#8217;s not like I run torrents or large file downloads on my phone, while on the go. And a website mostly loads just as fast on 10Mbit as it would on 100Mbit.</p>
<p>That said here in austria I rarely see over 3Mbit hspa speeds. But then again all-in flatrate contracts go for as little as 7,50€ a month. I think the LTE ones go for 45€ and more, and the Network has poor coverage.</p>
<p>But even if I were in the U.S I doubt LTE would be a must have thing for me.</p>
<p>T-Mobile&#8217;s website shows very good to excellent coverage near my home and work. Anyone have any experience with their data speeds? I currently use a LG Revolution on Verizon which is a terrible phone that lags a ton so I think pure Android might make up for the lack of LTE.. I would love to do the bring your own phone plan. Any advice from current or former T-Mobile members?</p>
<p>Yeah honestly I think I give up by now.</p>
<p>The way LTE is structured now is against the open philosophy of Google.  Google is standing up to the carriers here.. they should be applauded. Our phones should be able to run on any and every carrier.</p>
<p>Looks like it&#8217;s time to put my iPhone on eBay, definitely getting this as soon as it comes out!</p>
<p>No LTE doesn&#8217;t bother me  , mainly because I live in the UK.. Also where does he get his awesome wallpapers from ?</p>
<p>i think this a pretty good and fair review excited for the phone!</p>
<p>Google needs to start walking the talk (wisper). They can easily break the VZW Droid brand. AT&amp;T will roll over. Sprint and T-Mobile are already captured.</p>
<p>Time to step up&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never even consider a phone with such low memory.  I&#8217;d rather get the note II (which I will be doing), or if I were considering this for the low price, I&#8217;d just save my money for a better phone next year that actually has enough memory for the device to be useful.</p>
<p>An 8 GB model is nothing more than a sad joke :-) It is apparently done to reach a low price point. Don&#8217;t ever buy one.</p>
<p>And frankly&#8230;Am I crazy or is it time to reject the $50 step for each 8 GB of device storage? Total bullshit :-)</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s taken a page from Apple&#8217;s playbook here</p>
<p>The overcharge for access to tech? What? Help me understand. The blatant ripoff premium that iApple charges for off the shelf solutions?&#8230;wrapped in fancy chamfered aluminum, shiny glass, foam dice etc&#8230;?</p>
<p>Well heeled consumers can afford it. It is the money suck from those that can&#8217;t that is bothersome&#8230;</p>
<p>A price scale based on memory capacity is an easy way to to pad the profit margin. Another way is to build a CPU and blow fuses on it to disable functionality unless the customer pays you not to. Hello Intel!</p>
<p>My point is its common practice to offer a &#8220;base model&#8221; at an attractive entry point to get people interested, and several &#8220;upscale&#8221; models for anyone willing to pay for the extras.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus as a &#8220;weak display&#8221; ?? What the actual f***?</p>
<p>Quote The Verge:</p>
<p>Display: 9/10<br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review</a></p>
<p>Seriously?  A &#8220;weak display&#8221; was ranked by <strong>you</strong> as a 9/10 ?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;like an alarming lack of LTE&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Alarming? Really? That&#8217;s the word you&#8217;re going with? Drama Queen much,  Topolsky?  I don&#8217;t recall you using that particular adjective when the previous iPhone lacked LTE.  That&#8217;s because LTE is still in it&#8217;s infancy.  The NEXUS 4 has HSPA+ 42, which unlike LTE, most of the country has, and is practically almost as fast as LTE.</p>
<p>When you consider the feature set, the specs, the software, and the price, this phone is at least a 9.  I&#8217;m starting to think The Verge needs to keep you away from non-Apple products if they&#8217;re going to get a fair shake.</p>
<p>But when iPhone didn&#8217;t have LTE you were the drama queen! Not it&#8217;s Topolsky?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?  I never cared about LTE.  Still don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Troll harder.</p>
<p>I agree with everything but your final sentence. Josh wouldn&#8217;t state that the Android OS is the most advanced mobile OS on the market if he was trying to keep readers away from non-Apple products.</p>
<p>Sigh&#8230; I would totally buy this phone if it had LTE (specifically, Verizon, because let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; they have the best coverage)</p>
<p>Both Engadget and TechCrunch said the screen was really great.</p>
<p>Gonna have to check it out myself as this is my next. (First Android)</p>
<p>Wow finally, mail is to the modern day standards!!! Thank you, Google. Took you only 4 years!!!</p>
<p>Thanks Josh. Great Read. Still going to buy!           -Sent from my Galaxy S III</p>
<p>Why do other reviews say the battery life is bad?</p>
<blockquote>Google says it worked overtime on making sure low-light performance was improved on the Nexus 4, and I&#8217;m happy to say it is better than the last phone, though not a quantum lead forward (as Nokia&#8217;s new Lumia 920 is). </blockquote>
<p>OK, if there is a clear acknowledgement there that the Nokia Camera is a quantum leap forward, how in the hell to both cameras score an 8/10???</p>
<p>Because of all the other issues with the camera reported in the Lumia review. Just get over it.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be purchasing this device but this approach from Google definitely excites me for when my GS3 starts showing it&#8217;s age &amp; my Sprint contract is expiring here in a couple of years!!!</p>
<p>Gorilla Glass front AND back? Now that&#8217;s just a waste of Gorilla.</p>
<p>Man walks into a diner and asks for a Gorilla sandwich. &quot;One Gorilla sandwich? &quot; , the chef asks. &#8220;Yes one Gorilla  sandwhich please&#8221;. &#8220;Are you nuts? You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to slice up a whole Gorilla for just one sandwich do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>For Christ&#8217;s sake man, use a pop filter!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest. If this were an iPhone without LTE in late 2012 everyone would be freaking the hell out.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re talking rapture-like levels of insanity in fanboi land. Apple would be written off as an also-ran.</p>
<p>However for an Android phone, it seems the lack of LTE is worth, at most, 0.3 to 0.5 reduction on the rating scale.</p>
<p>I also find it funny that what was once considered the iPhone&#8217;s design flaw, glass on the back, now comes to Android&#8217;s flagship more than a year later, again without much of a reduction in rating.</p>
<p>Android phones deserve the same level of scrutiny that Apple gets. No LTE and it&#8217;s nearly 2013 is inexcusable.</p>
<p>LTE isn&#8217;t the future. I don&#8217;t know why people are so obsessed with it. It&#8217;s expensive, it guzzles battery, and I don&#8217;t even notice a difference anyway. Do I really need that much speed to browse Twitter? No, I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Then how was Apple able to add LTE to a phone while making it thinner, lighter and yet still retain battery life?</p>
<p>Just because Samsung and LG can&#8217;t do it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not possible.</p>
<p>If LTE isn&#8217;t the future of mobile broadband, what is?</p>
<p>wow and it still scored Higher than the Lumia 920&#8230;.. how odd</p>
<p>I was really considering this device over the 920 because of the specs and price; but after this review im getting the feeling that the price is where its at for a reason so it looks like its the Lumia 920</p>
<p>shame because there are some nice features in the nexus 4 (hardware and that camera ui is nice)</p>
<p>had to stop reading and post: wow that phone is sexy! i&#8217;m coming from a AT&amp;T iphone4 and don&#8217;t mind like the lack of LTE &#8211; on wifi all day every day.</p>
<p>I have never had a Android phone, always iPhone. This really looks awesome and it&#8217;s my next.</p>
<p>I feel the review was written with the bitterness of a lack of LTE and unfairly overemphasised certain points to balance this. The display got 9/10 but the review would state more like 7 or 8 and the call reception/quality was good (very good from what you said) but you gave it a 6 because of a lack of LTE. Come on Josh, we expected better reviewing than this&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, I live in the UK and I&#8217;m going to be a student until 2016. Should I buy this and hope it lasts for 3.5 years or get a Galaxy Nexus and buy a new phone in about 2 years?</p>
<p>Definitely buy this. Either way, by the time you upgrade next the phone you choose will be over 3 years old. Might as well start out with something that&#8217;s a little more future-proof.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the lack of LTE that bothers me, the network I&#8217;m probably going to use is Three and they&#8217;re upgrading their network to LTE next year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a Galaxy Nexus user (on Verizon) since last year. I was SO EXCITED to buy the next Nexus smartphone, and intended to get one at launch. Looks like that&#8217;s not happening now. I&#8217;m either going to wait, or get a SGS3 developer edition.</p>
<p>Consider me one disappointed consumer.</p>
<p>I like the Galaxy Note 2 ad on the screenshot of the phone</p>
<p>1337</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad things: No LTE&#8221;</p>
<p>Fuck LTE. It&#8217;s only a way for carriers to extort money out of everyone, including the consumer, the OEM and Google, and it&#8217;s not even available everywhere. Literally just lay this marketing nonsense down in a grave already.</p>
<p>And before anyone says &#8220;hurr, did you think this before the Nexus 4?&#8221; Yes, yes I did think that. I&#8217;ve always known LTE to be a money extortion. It guzzles battery life, costs a fortune, and I don&#8217;t even notice a difference anyway. I&#8217;m never getting anything on contract again.</p>
<p>Glass back.<br />
iPhone 4, 4s: GENIUS! HIGH QUALITY!<br />
Nexus 4: Negative! Easily breakable if you drop it</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Did the back of the iPhone 4 <strong>crack</strong> during the review process?</p>
<p>I quote Josh with the his statement on the camera:<br />
&#8220;not a quantum lead forward (as Nokia&#8217;s new Lumia 920 is).&#8221;<br />
But still the 920 and Nexus 4 score the same points for Camera(s)?<br />
I personally don&#8217;t care which phone &#8216;wins&#8217; but it would be nice to have consistency in reviews &#8211; reviews done only days apart. featuring the same reviewer(s)&#8230;?!<br />
I&#8217;m not crazy, am I?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue that there&#8217;s more to a camera than just the sum of its performance metrics (low-light, clarity, etc). The review clearly points out that the new interface is brilliant, not to mention the truly innovative PhotoSpheres.</p>
<p>So, the camera was scored 8, wow same as the 920.<br />
So what the hell? no consistency bro, same score wtf?</p>
<p>Fair review. I was expecting the 920 and this to be worlds apart in a score and there would be a bloodbath of rage comments. +1</p>
<p>Well there&#8217;s your problem, you&#8217;re using AT&amp;T HSPA+, try some T-Mobile HSPA+ they&#8217;ve actually put more effort into making it faster cough 42.2 mbps cough. Don&#8217;t forget they were faster than AT&amp;T before LTE.</p>
<p>Exactly&#8230;!! I consistently get between 18-22Mbps down and 2-3 up on my GS2 where I live so I do not care at all about LTE. At&amp;t is just flat out garbage.</p>
<p>Can you configure a proxy server on it? Most android devices can&#8217;t, what about this one?</p>
<p>My big question is: are all T-Mobile phones going to be criticized for a lack of LTE until T-Mo finally launches their own LTE network?</p>
<p>The N4 is obviously T-Mobile focused: they&#8217;re the only carrier subsidizing it, they&#8217;re the only ones with DC-HSPA+ and Google have always had a good relationship with them. Taking that into account, isn&#8217;t it slightly wrong to judge a phone for lacking features that its primary carrier doesn&#8217;t even offer anyway?</p>
<p>kieran thank you for keeping it oh so real.</p>
<p>Sarcasm?</p>
<p>Could be a biased review. The reason why  the lacking of LTE connectivity is explained all over the internet. Don&#8217;t forget this is a only $349 device, without the addition of LTE is very much fine to many of us. Therefore, the call/reception section shouldn&#8217;t be reflected for such low score. <br />
Ip5 has the almost same design as last generation. So do you think a phone that is just stretched longer than last generation phone worth a 9 points in design? I doubt it</p>
<blockquote>a 1.3 megapixel lens up front</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised no one has picked up on this.</p>
<p>Picked up on what?</p>
<p>While I don&#8217;t need this device right now; I will purchase it for the sake of supporting something I believe in. We are losing sight of the big picture here. What Google is doing is huge. Launching this phone at this price, unlocked, is a major step towards giving people the power to be smart consumers about their cellphone plans. The whole controversy over LTE might seem like a huge deal to some but in the grander scope of things it&#8217;s not as important as attempting to gain the most market penetrance possible for this device. The key is changing people&#8217;s mindsets about what we should and shouldn&#8217;t put up with. When this whole thing started it was like a wild west and companies made their own rules as they went along, while shafting the consumer as hard as they could. Forcing us to commit to contracts , under their conditions, is downright criminal. I applaud their decision and I hope others follow suit.</p>
<p>i agree.</p>
<p>The sooner you connards realize that Google wants its users to take advantage of its Cloud based services. Since that wasnt obvious I&#8217;ll drop some facts. NO NEXUS PHONE HAS HAS MORE THAN 16GB OF STORAGE. I&#8217;m a bit surprised the Nexus 10 has 32 but I understand how that market is different. Although that doesnt change how Google wants you to use its Drive service.</p>
<p>Also&#8230; My fellow Americans. LTE (or lack thereof) is not the issue&#8230; Whats <em>IS</em> important is that DC-HSPA <strong>s up to</strong> 42mbps, LTE  <strong>s up to</strong> 100mbps. While the LTE buzz word component is neat it won&#8217;t even be fully rolled out in the States for another couple years and it will be years after that before the speeds will be consistently above 20mbps. Please do your research. Nokia has has has HSDPA+ devices out for years and my current Nokia N9 gets 10+mbps on average. Once Google refines Android 4.2 no doubt it will be an OS to reckon with.</p>
<p>Alright, I&#8217;ve said my piece, argue about something that cannot change and if it did would not matter at all. The point people seem to be missing is that Google have a specific direction they want to steer their services and the idea has always been &#8216;Open, cloud based computing&#8217;. They cant do that if they kowtow to carriers.</p>
<p>Wow what a disappointment, I guess my search for a new phone will continue  I was really hoping this would be the one.</p>
<p>&#8230;Seriously?</p>
<p>battery life not even as good as phones running lte, review have proven(big no no for me) camera sucks (big no no for me) low storage :/<br />
the only reason to be excited for it is its the main google phone but thats all it has going for it&#8230;.trust me i really wanted to buy it but its not doing much right looking at all the phones that came out in the past 5-6 months.</p>
<p>I like how the design of the phone was completely left out of the review. I guess when the phone is ugly you just ignore it.</p>
<p>Except that, you know, it is not ugly at all.</p>
<p>If you do the basic stuff like popular aps, net browsing email etc LTE is not needed.<br />
In Italy LTE just started and it will be a joke for a few years. We get very high prices and very low cap with a below average coverage ( now) so thanks but no thanks. Nexus 4 is a winner because there are A LOT of users that are not in the US and do not have Verizon. Ironically one might think that the phone will cost less when subscribing to a 2 year contract, but the opposite is true. I&#8217;d prefer to buy the phone and go with no contract every time.</p>
<p>$300 is a fair price for a brand new smart phone even for someone living in the USA.</p>
<p>Unless very high speed is crucial to your work performance and you don&#8217;t download porn 24/7 who cares if instead of 3 seconds you download a video in 15 ?</p>
<p>Unless you need LTE for work yet you complain about the lack of LTE my question is:  Why do you need a very fast speed  ?</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t usually post, but have been drinking all evening&#8230;<br />
let&#8217;s look at this from a normal user perspective. i am someone who bought an unlocked galaxy nexus last year for $650.<br />
design: a bit more refined than last year. not a lot different but better for sure. no one will be ashamed to carry this phone around.<br />
internals: way, way better. monster cpu, more memory, better gpu.<br />
battery life: better.<br />
screen: much better.<br />
software: incremental, but a marked improvement over ics.<br />
storage: same (16 gb). not great, but matches what was there.<br />
radio: i think the gnex was 14 or 21 mb down. this is 42. better.<br />
camera: better.<br />
oh, and by the way, it&#8217;s $300 less than last year. if lte is a negative, how is that not a huge positive? $350 unlocked!! that is bananas. no excuses, not having lte is not good, but what % of the world does it impact? 5? 10? hspa+ (at 42 mbps) is absolutely acceptable for the next 12-18 months.  absolutely getting this day one and i will not be &#8216;perplexed&#8217; or &#8216;annoyed&#8217; or &#8216;frustrated&#8217;. ridiculous review.</p>
<p>The lack of LTE seems like it belongs with one of those first world problem memes.</p>
<p>I would probably be upset if I spent the majority of the time getting less than 1 Mbps down and up.  If you can pull an average of 5 Mbps on average that&#8217;s more than sufficient. Not even close to worth losing points over.</p>
<p>I can see this being my nest phone.</p>
<p>will you tweet from your nest?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&#8220;As someone who uses my phone for business, this isn&#8217;t just about downloading big files — it&#8217;s about the device being responsive and quickly updating when I need something. &quot;</p>
<p>I find this comment irrelevant, close to ridiculous.</p>
<p>reception/call quality a 6? you should rename this section to LTE or not LTE that is the question. unless this phone has terrible call quality.</p>
<p>Complement of WiFi radios, not compliment.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the plus side, <strong>call quality and reception was excellent</strong> on the phone. I only had one dropped called while testing, and general sound and clarity was top notch. LG smartly equipped the Nexus 4 with a loud and clear speaker, and an earpiece that carries surprisingly clean audio.&#8221;</p>
<p>And gave &#8220;Call Quality/Reception&#8221; a 6. I know you want to show your disappointment for the lack of LTE, but it&#8217;s just plain misleading this way. I don&#8217;t care if you give it different scores and then subtract points for that if you care so much about it, I do not give anything about LTE and want to compare phones without taking it into account.</p>
<p>What noone seems to realize is that this phone really is a bomb. Its half the price of an iPhone 5 where i live. The best of Android at half the price of the best of iOS</p>
<p>Josh, why do you give a 6 for reception/call quality if you&#8217;re in a shitty area?? That&#8217;s certainly at&amp;t&#8217;s fault for shoddy service and not the device.</p>
<p>So according to score, this is better phone than Lumia 920? Are you kidding me? They are in completely different league. This one here is a toy compared to 920. The problem is that Verge seems to hugely favor Android devices and number of cores/megahertz in the CPU but I guess this is more like a geek site than normal human beings site.</p>
<p>And why are the comments sorted last-first order? That&#8217;s just dumb.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a joke right? The Lumia 920 looks like a toy. Note the fruity clown colours? WP&#8217;s ecosystem is laughable. WP  OS functionality is severely limited in comparison.</p>
<p>The price is only if you buy in the Google Play, in stores like THE PHONE HOUSE the phone cost 599€, and is really stupid and FAIL put the same score to the camera like the Lumia 920 :S, desing?? that a desing??? the same piece of plastic black and old?. Ecosystem 9??¿?¿?¿?¿? you guys deserve one check in your way to work, or defenitly Google or Apple is paying you to this this &#8220;reviews&#8221;</p>
<p>Software and Ecosystem should be 6</p>
<p>why is that can u elaborate ? <br />
let me guess ur just one of those fools who still think android is slow and laggy ?</p>
<p>They never elaborate&#8230;. they regurgitate arguments from 2009. I&#8217;m willing to bet he&#8217;s barely even heard of Jelly Bean&#8230;</p>
<p>Jelly Bean is OS of 7% of Android devices run on. When it reach 15%, Key Lime Pie will be already released for 6 months, while KLP itself will be 1% like JB has been.</p>
<p>Who gives a fuck, this is Nexus!</p>
<p>Do you mean most of people don&#8217;t give a fuck for Nexus?</p>
<p>Are you intentionally daft, obviously what I mean is that Nexus devices always get the latest Android, so nobody cares about your BS about what other versions are out there.</p>
<p>But it is slow and laggy. Only project butter isn&#8217;t or are you one of those fools who never compared it yourself to iOS?</p>
<p>My area is so saturated with LTE users that I barely get 10 down, no to mention im already paying out the ass for verizon</p>
<p>8.3 for this top device? Are you kidding me? It deserved at <em>least</em> an 8.8. Here in Europe we don&#8217;t have LTE (the Netherlands) and I&#8217;m happy if I get 2 Mb down /384 up. €300 for this device is amazing! Can&#8217;t wait till the end of November!</p>
<p>Think so too ! ;)</p>
<p>Actually I think it is a real IPhone killer. I&#8217;ll buy it with 32Gb storage as soon as it will be available ! No Doubt !</p>
<p>Millions of people said with their money iPhone killed Nexus. No one will buy turd even it&#8217;s cheaper than donut.</p>
<p>Haters gonna hate. This phone is light years ahead of iPhone 4(S), which is still in the market. Anyone who wants an Android phone with more features than the IP5 can get one of the other flagship devices from HTC, Samsung, Sony, LG, or Motorola.</p>
<p>Anand laughed at you. Best newest Android flagships are outperformed by 1 year old 4S.</p>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S III and HTC One X both outperform the 4S, as their successors will beat the 5. But what is performance alone, when you have the joke of an OS &#8212; iOS with its pitiful idiosyncratic software &#8220;solutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am buying the Nexus 14, simply have to have both. I think the tablet is the better deal but the NEX4 is enough of an upgrade over the GNex, especially at the price.</p>
<p>Another angle: 8.5 if you don&#8217;t care about LTE? 8.5 phone for $299, sure, I&#8217;ll take one tymv.</p>
<p>And yes, the new ipad 4 GPU spanks the T604.  However, that doesn&#8217;t imply that it can&#8217;t do it&#8217;s job. Yes, Apple&#8217;s GPU is faster, whether that matters or is noticeable in every day usage is YTBD. Having a faster CPU may help the Nexten. Either way, pending deep reviews, it&#8217;s a great value at $400.</p>
<p>My next phone. I noticed, since the iPhone 5 now LTE is a must have feature! I don&#8217;t recall the 4S getting crapped on because it didn&#8217;t have LTE.</p>
<p>I guess it wasn&#8217;t expected too then?</p>
<blockquote>I don’t recall the 4S getting crapped on because it didn’t have LTE.</blockquote>
<p>Yes it did. The Verge noted that in the review. The LTE version of the Galaxy Nexus was rated higher than the iPhone and it became the reviewer&#8217;s personal phone.</p>
<p>But more importantly, that was a year ago and all LTE phones had bad bettery life. A year later, it has gotten much better.</p>
<p>I have really been looking forward to getting a nexus phone Mr Joshua Topolsky, but the review has kind of left me with a bad feeling about it. <br />
Can i ask you, if this had LTE would the score and the review be a lot better or up beat? Still a good score.<br />
I can&#8217;t really afford LTE here in Melbourne Australia (yes we have a bit of it here) so it doesn&#8217;t really effect me but the rest of it does.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll pay for the LTE modem:&#8217;(<br />
Google please give me that option!</p>
<p>despite the total numbers, this phone seems to be near perfect. 10 in performance, 10 in software, 9 in battery , 8 in camera and display. all this for £280 ? satisfied would be a HUGE understatement.</p>
<p>Well, LTE will be offered here in Brazil by next year, only in some major cities and in some carriers (not sure at what cost, taxes here are extremely high). I&#8217;m going to the US next month and I&#8217;m not sure which phone to buy. Should I buy this beautiful Nexus 4 for $350 (16GB) or some other phone, more expensive (GS3, One X, Droid HD, Optimus G&#8230;)  only because there is a possibility of a 4G network next year here in Brazil?</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT!       IMPORTANTE!       ITALIA!</strong><br />
For Italians the price is higher of 200$, for equality here there&#8217;s a petition for  LG; the price must be the same in ever Country! (Sorry for my poor English).</p>
<p>In Italia il prezzo di questo oggetto è più alto di 200€, non è giusto. Per l&#8217;uguaglianza economica fra i Paesi, è un ingiustizia. Qui c&#8217;è una petizione per LG, partecipate, è importante!</p>

<p>&gt; <a href="http://www.activism.com/it_IT/petizione/lg-nexus-4-tagliamo-il-prezzo-italiano/39734" target="_blank">http://www.activism.com/it_IT/petizione/lg-nexus-4-tagliamo-il-prezzo-italiano/39734</a> &lt;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>gabriel even if LTE rolls out in brazil next year, how long will it take before it is in every city?</p>
<p>About 2 years. With the World Cup taking place here in 2014, the government wants to deploy 4G network in all host cities and mid-size cities which will host fans and tourists.  By the end of 2014 the vast majority of mid-size cities (I live in one) will have 4G network.</p>
<p>Call quality/reception was a low score for the LTE Nokia Lumia too</p>
<p>Hey Josh,<br />
could you tell us if there is some kind of a reset button?<br />
Or what can we do if we ever get a BSOD or a bootloop? Usually I would pull my battery</p>
<p>You can always hold power button + volume key down to get it to reset.</p>
<p>$350 off contract, and you care about LTE?</p>
<p>SMH</p>
<p>I wish the lack of LTE was a real issue for me. I live in Chicago and AT&amp;T&#8217;s LTE network is terrible here. I get better speeds on HSPA+. Also, T-Mobile&#8217;s HSPA+ 42 network is available so when my AT&amp;T contract runs out I can switch to T-Mo.</p>
<p>@Joshua<br />
Regarding the storage, you said you reviewed the 16gb version, when you first started the device how much free space did you have?</p>
<p>I got my Galaxy S3 last week, 16GB edition, and when I first started it I had only 11 GB free space. but there I have external SD card to increase it&#8230;.</p>
<p>should be around 12-13gb</p>
<p>for those pining for LTE, remember, the first GNex was not a LTE device.<br />
I am sure a north american LTE device [which does not GUARANTEE VZW but ATT] will come</p>
<p>There is no way LTE uses less battery than 3G even if it has sleep feature and works less due to higher speeds simply because you have apps in the background that always ask for data periodically.</p>
<p>Did you know that if you use only VOIP and IM u can get away with Edge connection and conserve battery? It works just fine especially on T-Mobile edge. Now if you need maps and augmentet reality apps you will need to turn on your 3G obviously. So ask yourself why do you need data and you will come to conclusion if you need LTE or not.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote><p>IT&#8217;S EASILY THE BEST ANDROID PHONE ON THE MARKET, SAVE FOR ONE SMALL THING<blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p>But the Nexus 4 is ranked lower than SG3 and HTC One X?&#8230;.. Interesting. I&#8217;m STILL BUYING&#8230;. This Is My Next..!!!</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 came out several months after the One X and SG3. The scoring changes during those months.</p>
<p>For its price this phone is pretty good, but as a competitor with iPhone 5 and windows phone 8 devices I think it falls flat.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, at first glance at a certain angle,<br />
it reminds me of the old Nokia N900, but much slimmer.</p>
<p>nooooooooooooope, not really seeing it :P</p>
<p>The front certainly reminds me of the N900, flat with rounded corners.<br />
The band surrounding the edge of the phone, slightly reflective and silvery.</p>
<p>but only the front does it looks like the N900,<br />
From the side, it looks too thin (like a N900 without the keyboard part)</p>
<p>Maybe the problem is with Verizon insisting on adding their crap to the Nexus 4 and Google didn&#8217;t want to do that.  No LTE means making and selling only one phone worldwide, right?  I have no problem with not having LTE.  I&#8217;ll get a Nexus 4 and use it on T-Mobile when my Sprint contract expires.</p>
<p>What is it with battery life and reviewers? Other sites say the battery life is poor. I think they don&#8217;t realise that you must fully charge and discharge batteries a couple of times to get the best long-term performance. Always fully charge and discharge the batteries on new products.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the problem right now is a lack of optimization. Nexus phones usually come out ever so slightly in the rough and polished to perfection over the course of one or two months. Nexus 4 will be no different.</p>

<p>yeah i dont think they give google enough credit for the price</p>
<p>My Thoughts Exactly. I&#8217;m quite surprised with Josh&#8217;s review.</p>
<p>About the difference in battery life etc. between the various reviews.<br />
It looks like Google handed out phones with different software on them.<br />

(Scroll down to commenter munkustrap=</p>
<p>i wonder if the Nexus 4 Heats up like the Palm Pre did when using the inductive charging</p>
<p>Do reviewers and tech blogs understand this awesome phone has the specs of a GS3 or better,  and it is for $300? Damn if they did have LTE on this phone they would complain about the battery now rather than the radio attena&#8230;</p>
<p>Still a bit puzzled how this has a lower score than its predecessor. Is it the lack of LTE?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big part of the reason why.</p>
<p>Is it expensive to have a micro SD slot or something I don&#8217;t understand why its not on this device.</p>
<p>Google supports the cloud.</p>
<p>I know that but uploading pics to google plus downgrades the quality. Also why would they release a 32gb Nexus then. I think they might release a bigger version later because 16gb seems a bit small.</p>
<p>Ridiculous review imo.</p>
<p>So do old Verge reviews depreciate their ratings as time goes on so new phones/tablets/computers/accessories are rated higher or will we eventually see 11 point scores (somehow)? Seems like even though both the iPhone 5 and Nexus 4 show relatively minor innovation they still get high marks. And they are good phones for sure. But reading both reviews gives a different take than seeing the numbers when you compare it to old reviews of the Galaxy Nexus and iPhone 4 or even Lumia 900. The excitement is gone. It&#8217;s an interesting situation.</p>
<p>So glass on the back of the iphone is beautiful and innovative, but on the nexus 4 is a sin? humm</p>
<p>It&#8217;s stupid on both (more so on the iPhone because the glass juts out past the band).</p>
<p>I really like the glass back on the iPhone 4. Mine lasted two and a bit years just fine. I also miss the steel construction — it looked far more premium than the aluminium iPhone 5.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 looks like an Apple gadget, iPhone 4 looked timeless and beautiful.</p>
<p>When the back <strong>cracks</strong> during the interview process, yeah, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a &#8216;sin&#8217; on the N4</p>
<p>The same would have happened to the iPhone 4 if Josh dropped it.</p>
<p>I can live without Lte for  now   Im so getting this phone for Christmas!!!</p>
<p>Non removable battery, no LTE, no SD card slot.  Where&#8217;s the outrage people??</p>
<p>$350.</p>
<p>You can buy two of these phones for the same price as another flagship device, and you&#8217;ll instantly double storage, battery life, and connection speeds.</p>
<p>LTE is the only one that is worth complaining about to some. Non-removable battery and no MicroSD slot are unimportant.</p>
<p>Personally for me the LTE doesn&#8217;t matter. T-mobile have good HSPA+ coverage in my area.</p>
<p>Cuts costs and less components, Google doesn&#8217;t pay for the SD reader and doesn&#8217;t pay the FAT patent fee to Micorsoft. Less storage and no LTE means it won&#8217;t compete against Android OEM&#8217;s products.</p>
<p>Omg, where do u get these wallpapers???</p>
<p>The street view anywhere feature looked awesome in the video! The shots in that persons backyard looked like so much more than just standard panorama.</p>
<p>Thank god for no LTE. I can buy it with no contract and put a tmobile at&amp;t or any other sim i prefer. The only convincing verizon needs is sales numbers and this is not the device for that. A network who rejected something like HTC One X doesnt deserve a device like it anyways. I hope we can get better coverage from other networks so people have a choice to move away from such a mess and not let the networks force crap down our throat.</p>
<p>As someone who lives in a Verizon LTE Market, I can definitely say that this is my next Nexus. Last year I upgraded my OG Droid to the iPhone 4s. The droid&#8217;s screen was cracked and was on its last leg.  Later the device was returned because the battery life was horrible on Verizon and lets be honest Verizon 3G EVDO data is horrifically slow. I&#8217;m talking about 512 kbps max on good connection was my experience.  I use my phone for web browsing, emails, google music, downloading podcast with Pocketcast, and sometimes I make phone calls.</p>
<p>The GNex came out within my 30 day return window and I scooped that puppy us as soon as I could.  4G LTE with unlimited data, who could pass that up? The battery life was on par with the Verizon iPhone 4s which really isn&#8217;t saying much, (you gotta keep a charger) but at least I got faster data. Well that&#8217;s what I thought until my wife brought home her AT&amp;T iPhone 4s. In my neighborhood that speeds are basically the same as AT&amp;T HSPA+. On her phone she averages 8 Mbps down while I am averaging close to 5.  Yes, I have seen speeds of 30Mbps down and 10Mbps up, but that was when I was in downtown Atlanta on I-75.</p>
<p>Lets face it there is no LTE because of Verizon and the whole Droid Razr fiasco last year.  Plus majority of the world uses GSM.</p>
<p>So for me  this is worth switching back to GSM version since:</p>
<ol>
	<li>its unlocked and I can get a unlimited prepaid plan.</li>
	<li>if I ever decide to upgrade with Verizon I will have to pay for unlocked devices to avoid losing my data plan.</li>
	<li>I don&#8217;t have to scour the interwebs for the latest updates because VZW is testing for six months.</li>
	<li>when i travel abroad my phone won&#8217;t be a paperweight again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bye Bye VZW! Can you hear me now? Good!</p>
<p>Since LTE plans don&#8217;t have unlimited data, I don&#8217;t see the point of ever upgrading to an LTE device.  I always try to connect to WiFi for free because I CANT AFFORD to pay for wireless data when watching any streaming video.</p>
<p>Try Sprint.</p>
<p>For me price is key (and a hell of a lot of other people).</p>
<p>LTE &#8211; not key &#8211; I&#8217;m in the UK with limited coverage (even when you factor in the next 12 monts of expansion) and as price is key (see above!) then having a very expensive sim only contract is a no go.</p>
<p>So the Nexus suits me and many others &#8211; the rest of the competition are at least £100 &#8211; £300 more and any LTE they happen to ave on board are no use to me until we get LTE everywhere 3G is and at the same kind of prices. Personally I am happy the Nexus 4 has no LTE or at least has started with no LTE (lets face it do we really thing it will always be LTE&#8217;less??)</p>
<p>I will preface my comment with my overall assessment: I think this is <strong>the</strong> Android phone to get, especially if you&#8217;re on T-Mobile like me. (Hell, this phone may keep me from switching to an iPhone.) It&#8217;s also arguably the best designed Android phone ever and clears up the faults of the Galaxy Nexus wonderfully. Now for miscellaneous thoughts:</p>
<p>First a question: Is it the Nexus 4 because it&#8217;s ~4&quot; or because it&#8217;s the 4th Nexus? The size I&#8217;d say is closer to 5&quot;  than 4. I&#8217;d prefer it more  the 4 was for the iteration rather than the size, but it messes up the branding with regard to the Nexus 7 and 10, which are named for their screen sizes. This is something that&#8217;s always driven me up the wall about Android products &#8211; the branding is poorly executed. The only successful branding so far has been Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lines. I know the Nexus line isn&#8217;t supposed to be a huge success at that level (&#8216;cause I imagine Google doesn&#8217;t want to screw over other Android hardware makers), but there&#8217;s no denying it&#8217;s going to kill off interest for other phones/tablets plus the fact that there is a sizable advertising push for these devices at all leads us to believe that they want some sort of commercial success with Nexus devices. They might as well get the branding 100% there.</p>
<p>Second: I think the LTE thing is funny. There&#8217;s the camp that thinks if it doesn&#8217;t have LTE then the device sucks. Worse still is the camp that suddenly decided that LTE is unnecessary even if they held the opposite feeling just before. Personally I don&#8217;t think LTE has thus far ever been worth the trade-off in device cost, plan cost and battery life. Especially not here in the US with the unchanged size in data caps; that is the network is faster, costs more but the ceiling is the same. HSPA+ is more than good enough without having to make those sacrifices.</p>
<p>Third: Back to the device itself. It&#8217;s undoubtedly the best Android design out. And I love that Nexus devices have a cohesive design language. But it still looks like there is too little design. It feels like lazy minimalism rather than something along the lines of Apple or Nokia&#8217;s minimalist approaches. I&#8217;m going to get crap for this but I feel like Google&#8217;s approach is like if you gave an engineer the task to &#8220;be minimalist&#8221; whereas Apple/Nokia gave that same task to an architect.</p>
<p>I concur, referring to this as the Nexus 5 would have made more sense; it&#8217;d make room nomenclature-wise for, say, both a 3.5-3.7&quot; and a 4&quot;-4.3&quot; device.</p>
<p>This is my next</p>
<p>That Photo Sphere looks like crap. You should try MS <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=f20b8df1-6b46-449f-891a-8ba03d9983be">photosynth</a>.</p>
<p>Some another elite tech blog has written a thousand word editorial explaining why cheap devices are not good for market industry.</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s the point when ultimately Americans don&#8217;t buy less costly value for money unlocked non aluminum android devices.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a fail. Sorry Google. Sigh!</p>
<p>This may very well be my next.</p>
<p>&#8220;As someone who uses my phone for business&#8221; it&#8217;s As someone who uses HIS phone for business</p>
<p>Can we get a picture of this wonderfully designed clock app?  Did I miss this somehow?</p>
<p>1) This panorama mode, is it better then Photosynth lens app on WP8?<br />
2) Is new camera menu works like circular menu in Windows8&#8217;s OneNote or is totally different concept?</p>
<p>it&#8217;s about the same as photosynth<br />
noooooooooooidea&#8230; it&#8217;s like quick controls in the stock browser in ics</p>
<p>*the old android browser</p>
<p>I guess its a rip off. Google rips off various UI stuff from may OSes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a HUGE Nexus/Google/Android fan(boy), but I just can&#8217;t stand the faux-chrome on this thing. It really kind of ruins what would otherwise be a beautiful device.</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t care less about LTE. The majority of the places I frequent offer free WiFi anyway. But, the lack of a microSD slot to augment a meager 16GB of internal storage is a real deal breaker to me. For that reason alone, I won&#8217;t give this device a second thought. I suppose the potential of this device was hamstrung by cost-cutting initiatives.</p>
<p>Love the pictures.</p>
<p>according to Mr Matias Duarte said there is no SD support cause it &#8220;confuses users&#8221; Really?</p>
<p>it doesn&#8217;t make very much sense when you have multiple user accounts on 1 device<br />
partitions are not user friendly, he would rather have a single large volume</p>
<p>those were his arguments</p>
<p>Not sure how you call this a &#8220;high end&#8221; phone when it lacks LTE, an SD slot, a removable battery and only comes in 8GB and 16GB configurations.  This would have been a high end phone in about 2005.  It&#8217;s nice that it runs the latest version of unmolested Android, but there&#8217;s more to a modern smartphone than software.  Other than the CPU, my 3 year old Eppic 4G is more powerful and more versatile.</p>
<p>You keep telling yourself that&#8230;</p>
<p>In 2005, this would have been burned at a stake for witchcraft.</p>
<p>Why does the verge have all this crap that pops up all over the page? It&#8217;s damn near un-navigable. Dumb extra bar at top of page. Stupid floating bunch of pointless buttons. By the time the cluttered page loads and I&#8217;ve gotten the gratuitous elements out of the way, I don&#8217;t even want to read the article anymore. Why do people have to add all this nonsense to text?</p>
<p>adblock brah</p>
<p>I have read on other sites that the battery life sucked. But I also think that might be because they were using demo units and it wasn&#8217;t the final build. Josh didn&#8217;t mention anything about battery life so I&#8217;m still curious ho the battery life on this thing really is.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s the weird part.</p>
<p>I read the review at <em>Engadget</em>, <em>CNet</em> and <em>AnandTech</em>, and none of them said the Nexus 4 had an impressive battery life. AnandTech was probably the most positive, saying that it is enough to get through a typical day. The other two really blasted the device.</p>
<p>So iPad mini gets LTE but google flagship phone is not shopping with LTE.  This is all Verizon pushing google around. Googles bs excuse is that  it&#8217;s hard on battery life is total bs.</p>
<p>it wasn&#8217;t the only factor</p>
<p>Nexus looks really boring to me. Why did they make that kind of design which doesn&#8217;t have any interesting elements at all? It looks like cheap piece of plastic.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.lowbird.com/data/images/2010/06/to-do-list-trolling.jpg" /></p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t agree with your opinion =\= troll.</p>
<p>Am I to understand this is better than the Surface RT and comparable to Vivo Tablet? &#8230;. which are TABLETS&#8230;. that run windows OS&#8230;&#8230;what&#8230;.</p>
<p>Will forever be known as Nexus Brokeback&#8230;</p>
<p>As fast as LTE might be, I&#8217;m just not interested in supporting Verizon or AT&amp;T.  Their prices are outrageous.  I&#8217;m on Tmobile and they rolled out 42 Mbps HSDPA in my city so I&#8217;m fine with that.  I&#8217;m on WiFi 90% of the time anyways.  Even if I had LTE available, I would turn it off so save battery life.  I think the Verge (and others) are too hard on the Nexus 4 for not having LTE.  This is my next Nexus phone (upgrading from the Galaxy Nexus) and it will be awesome.</p>
<p>So, let me get this straight: Since a phone that is supposed to be unlocked and updated directly from Google doesn&#8217;t have LTE this makes it somewhat crippled? Nevermind the fact that 2 out of the 3 carriers in the US use proprietary CDMA tech, and the biggest one of them <strong>cough</strong> Verizon <strong>cough</strong> shat all over the nexus program with their GNex. Why does every review hate on this phone for not having 4G LTE? I know people would prefer it, but Google made a phone to be used on the WORLD MARKET, not just one that will majorly benefit us US consumers, plus the few other markets that have LTE. Hell, even the current 4G LTE tech isn&#8217;t true LTE, more like 3.95G wannabe LTE. I will most likely pick this up and just have to deal with the extra 1 to 3 seconds it takes to fully load a web page over HSPA+&#8230; damn.</p>
<p>Even if they did make an LTE version, which they won&#8217;t, and only had it for AT&amp;T (since T-Mobile hasn&#8217;t rolled out LTE yet), Verizon and Sprint customers would just bitch and moan even though their network, like I stated earlier, took a huge dump onto the chest of Google with their versions of the GNex.</p>
<p>yup, they&#8217;re both psudo 4g devices so it doesn&#8217;t really make too much sense :/ esp when you step out of the big US cities</p>
<p>To be fair. Sprint has handled the Galaxy Nexus quite well. The only knock against Sprint is delayed updates. Other than that, Sprint has been very hands-off with the Nexus line. I expect Sprint to carry the Nexus 4 next year.</p>
<p>Anyone got an iPhone (retina) version of that wallpaper? That would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Again, this is my next</p>
<p>Whatever. I want the latest Nexus all the time. Perfect gift for myself this Christmas</p>
<p>Surely getting this Nexus. Btw, whats the wallpaper??</p>
<p><a href="http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/2012/03/ipad-hd-retina-wallpaper/">Probably this.</a></p>
<p>james, there&#8217;s bunch of others wallpaper too! Awesome!! but the one in Nexus 4 is the poster the artist holding :/ i didn&#8217;t see the link for the wallpaper :[</p>
<p><img src="http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/iPad-Retina-Wallpaper-SimonCPage1-634x634.jpg" /><br />

<p>my mistake, found it !</p>
<p>that&#8217;s what i like to hear :)</p>
<p>I want this phone!</p>
<p>Was really hoping for a VZW Nexus 4, but I just might pick up a 30$-50$ a month TMo line since HSPA+ in my area is on avg 12-13down 4-7up. Throttling after 5gbs (unlimited) may be the only problem.</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 should be given a second score as an international version &#8211; not being marked down for not having LTE so that it can be more comparable with products such as the iPhone in the UK where LTE is not widely established.</p>
<p>Or in countries where the LTE bands are unsupported by the iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 is only offered without 4G in many countries.</p>
<p>Really appreciated  your use of qualitative remarks on performance and battery life in contrast with the benchmark some others reviewers used despite the non final software on the review devices.<br />
Shared some more thoughts on that  in my blog post &#8211;  <a href="http://wannabetechblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/things-you-should-avoid-making-review.html" target="_blank">http://wannabetechblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/things-you-should-avoid-making-review.html</a></p>
<p>I hope the glass back is easily replaced&#8230; If it is, I&#8217;m expecting to see some awesome 3rd party replacements.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;s not &#8211; <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12jze2/nexus_4_battery_may_not_be_so_hard_to_replace_acc/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12jze2/nexus_4_battery_may_not_be_so_hard_to_replace_acc/</a></p>
<p>Oh, that sucks&#8230;</p>
<p>As many people have already stated. Being in Europe means not having LTE is not that bad of a loss. This will be my next phone!</p>
<p>I also live in Europe, but  seems like the low price will be a strong point for the Nexus 4 only in a handful of countries (7 as far as I remember), where Play Store is available. If you live somewhere else you&#8217;ll have to spend more in order to become a proud owner of a Nexus 4 device, or maybe not so proud after all. Looks like I&#8217;ll be sticking to my Galaxy Nexus. I&#8217;m really disappointed by Google and mostly by LG (not that I have ever expected something more from LG).<br />

<p>I&#8217;m curious about the business model for this device.</p>
<p>Is the device being sold at cost, similar to the Nexus 7? Is Google subsidizing the device in the hope of making money through the ecosystem (i.e. apps, movies, music etc). Has anyone done an estimate of the cost to manufacture the device? Are we likely to see other manufacturers adopting this pricing?</p>
<p>Am curious whether this level of pricing is sustainable over the long term. (Personally, I would be happiest with strong but sustainable competition between Apple, Android and Windows. I think this would encourage most innovation, which would benefit users of all platforms).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any insight.</p>
<p>I also curious, because currently Google mobile revenue from iOS is 4x from Android. So what&#8217;s the point of developing Android?</p>
<p>has there been an update to that info?</p>
<p>I think I can understand the point of Android. Google wants control of mobile platforms, so it can ensure its services are available. e.g. otherwise there would be a risk of, say, Apple changing iOS to use Bing Search instead of Google Search.</p>
<p>In terms of the Nexus devices, I&#8217;m not clear on the benefit. Pricing the devices so aggressively squeezes the margins of other manufacturers (both on Android and other operating systems) who want to compete. Presumably, the money from the ecosystem goes to the owner of the &#8216;app&#8217; store, not the manufacturer of the device.</p>
<p>If the current pricing is &#8216;artificially&#8217; low, it could make the market less attractive and reduce competition, which could be bad for consumers in the long run.</p>
<p>What is this weather widget,  looks great,  can I get it on my Nexus 7 ?</p>
<p>Beautiful Widgets</p>
<p>&#8220;While testing the phone, I accidentally knocked the device off of my dining table and onto a hardwood floor&#8230; cracking the glass on the back. It&#8217;s a small fracture, but had I just paid $300 for the device, I would be irate, and I&#8217;m not sure what LG or Google&#8217;s policy is on replacement.&#8221; <br />
Sooo&#8230;LG and/or Google are responsible for your carelessness? How about just treating your devices better?</p>
<p>Mr. Topolsky doesn&#8217;t seem to be aware that LTE exists outside of the US, when in fact, we have had it longer than Americans&#8230; That, or worse: He is not aware that people outside of the US have Internet and reads The Verge.</p>
<p>Definitely my next phone. Only thing really complained about is the lack of LTE, I have never had LTE and I find HSPA+ to be plenty. I average 4mbps down and unless downloading a huge file, which I would do over WiFi, 4mbps gets everything done as fast as I need it. Tested opening Facebook and web pages with my HSPA+ vs a friends LTE and loaded up content just as fast, some pages would load about a second or so faster on LTE but I don&#8217;t see that as a deterrent to get this phone.</p>
<p>If you throw down your phone, isn&#8217;t a crack in the glass back the least of your problems?</p>
<p>8GB of memory is not enough for a tight camera like that #1</p>
<p>No SD card slop ( reference #1) additional issue.</p>
<p>The nexus 4 is an interesting iPod Touch alternative&#8230;. and a great value: but it really requires mobile data and streaming to &#8220;work&#8221; well&#8230; like the chromebook&#8230;.and because mobile data is overpriced&#8230; that is a no go for me. When mobile data is $5/ month for 4GB I am all in.</p>
<p><a href="http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/11/nexus-4-ipod-touch-alternative.html" target="_blank">http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/11/nexus-4-ipod-touch-alternative.html</a></p>
<p>absolutely best price value/ratio ever. Will definitelly buy it. Shame it has no SD card slot, as for LTE can you really notyice the difference between HSPA+ and LTE in US? Not really in Europe and even if you could the problem is in data plans &#8211; what&#8217;s the use of LTE if my data plan is e.g. 2GB and highest data plan for data + voice is 5GB</p>
<p>i will definitely get this one.</p>
<p>Why do people need 25 Mbps internet on a phone? My home speed internet is 12 Mbps and I already think that it&#8217;s more than fast. Do people really spend that much time on smartphone to stream 1080p videos or play MMO games?</p>
<p>Of course people dont need it.  Its all Epeen at this point. It sucks too, because too many people are missing the point; taking control away from the Carriers. Brainwashed fools.</p>
<p>But android has best apps in play store than windows</p>
<p>Does the wallpaper in the above review pictures exist anywhere online yet?</p>
<p>Nexus 4 FTW!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Tempting but LTE is supposed to be launching in Mexico on tuesday so I&#8217;ll buy the iPhone 5 and I really need more than 16 gb&#8230;</p>
<p>this is my next</p>
<p>If LTE was available, it&#8217;d probably bump up the price, maybe ATnT and Verizon and Sprint will get LTE versions soon.<br />
Since i&#8217;m in a third world  country where even normal 3G is quite expensive, i would&#8217;ve voted this a 9, since call quality and reception is great (just not LTE). (-1 cuz of 1 dropped call)</p>
<p>By the looks of it, this just might be my NEX&#8230; us, see what i did there?</p>
<p>i am looking fwd to this Nexus love the design and the price tag <br />
Google Rocks :)</p>
<p>There should really be a score for also &#8216;bang for the buck&#8217;.  Surely the score should reflect the fact that the device is like 50% cheaper than the competing products..</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of phones that only care about the looks. What good is it if a phone is slim and pretty, but to keep it alive I will have to put around it a monstrous case?! I&#8217;m sure if they dropped that silly glass back and replaced it by something more sensible and sturdy, and recessed the glass in front, they could make a phone that is much slimmer than this phone + an Otterbox or something like that. It would also be prettier.</p>
<p>And come on: Battery not replaceable? I easily get through 2 batteries on my Galaxy Nexus (poor signal in the office, frequent use). No way can this thing last me through a day, and I don&#8217;t always have access to a wall plug (via USB my Nexus hardly charges).</p>
<p>Not that thrilled about the LCD screen either. Yes, the GN display is over saturated. Could easily be fixed in software. That the GN display is a bit dark at auto brightness&#8230; big deal. In the beginning it troubled me, now I actually find it quite comfortable that I&#8217;m not blinded by the screen. It doesn&#8217;t hinder usability for me, and going to other phones feels uncomfortable because they are too bright.</p>
<p>The omission of a SD slot is silly too, 16 GB is hardly enough for me on my GN. I almost bought a S2 because of this. And now they even have an 8 GB version! Not everyone lives in a country that has good data plans. Heck, not even the US has that great data plans that you can always stream whatever you want, rather than saving the things on the phone.</p>
<p>&#8212;&gt; I&#8217;m glad I have a Galaxy Nexus, and there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d trade it in for the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>You Americans are darn spoiled.. You&#8217;ve got the best ecosystem in pretty much everything (and why? Because your dumb RIAA FIAA, MAFIAA and other bunch of shitty assosiations won&#8217;t allow it to expand abroad without being paid as hell), you&#8217;ve got the cheapest devices, best consumer service, everything that is invented by Apple, Google, MS is invented for Americans in mind, and yet you manage to complain about everything. No LTE shit, glass back shit etc.. why the hell glass back didn&#8217;t bother you on iPhone 4/iPhone 4S. It&#8217;s your fault and your stupidness that you slam the device on the ground and it broke. It&#8217;s not a minus.. You really should be moved to I don&#8217;t know Ukraine for a one year period. Maybe you would start to admire what you&#8217;ve got..</p>
<p>you jelly?</p>
<p>I think its a silly notion that LTE is such a deciding factor in a phone. HSPA+ is excellent for browsing and streaming music and the like but with Wi-FI almost everywhere these days its only a  matter of time before all that isn&#8217;t really necessary at all. I&#8217;ll be getting the phone because its a solid device, and unlike so many people, I dont drop my phone because I actually am careful with it <b>shrug</b></p>
<p>I just hope I get my order in before the first batch sell out.</p>
<p>Seems like Joshua surpressed to yawn at 4:30 while talking about &#8220;gesture typing&#8221;. :)<br />
Anyway good review as always. But I would like to see a camera comparison, especially in low light scenarios.</p>
<p>This comment system was definitely not made with quantity, management, &amp; browser performance in mind. The amount of comments here is desktop browser crippling on a quad core i7 smmfh.</p>
<p>My early 2011 MBP yawned and asked if I needed to do any real work.</p>
<p>Oh man.  I was soooo almost going to buy this until I saw no LTE!  I mean c&#8217;mon guys it&#8217;s like 2012 and like LTE still isn&#8217;t everywhere yet.  I need my fast LTE speeds so I can sit on my phone all day refreshing comments on the Verge to find someone to argue with about why LTE is such a big deal breaker for me.  I also eat at McDonalds all the time because I can&#8217;t be assed to wait 20 minutes for my food to cook. /s</p>
<p>But really.  The only people I could see this being a deal breaker for would be the people that are grandfathered into nice unlimited data plans.  For anyone else, it&#8217;s just a ridiculous point.  I don&#8217;t get why people would need speeds faster than what they could get in their homes&#8230;  Maybe cancel home internet and use the phone as a portable hotspots?  Well then have fun paying through the nose on that data plan.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all just a bunch of instant gratification crap &#8211; &#8220;I want it, and I want it now!&#8221; boohoo.  Heaven forbid we ever have to be patient for something, right?  My point is&#8230; LTE is a bonus, a nice one at that, but it&#8217;s not mandatory &#8211; your phone will work just fine without it.  And HSPA fulfills everything a smartphone would need to do.  This isn&#8217;t a gaming PC/Server where you need the fastest connection possible, it&#8217;s a damned mobile phone and HSPA gets the job done.</p>
<p>@Joshua Topolsky  Nexus 4 has easily breaking glass back , no Micro SD slot or huge on-board storage like 32G or more, No LTE , no dedicated camera button, No clear black&#8482; &amp; super touch display like Nokia 920, etc &#8230;how do you rate &#8220;Hardware&#8221; ? Still you offered 8/10 for Design? Isn&#8217;t it unfair to give same 8/10 to Lumia 920?</p>
<p>No, the Lumina 920 is a fat heavy phone, that&#8217;s looks just like last years failed Lumina 900.</p>
<p>AstroTurf is fun!</p>
<p>I have a question for Josh:<br />
&#8220;On the plus side, call quality and reception was excellent on the phone. I only had one dropped called while testing, and general sound and clarity was top notch. &quot;</p>
<p>Okay, other than the lack of LTE: How did reception/call quality get a 6/10? I think this needs to be revised.</p>
<p>The 6/10 is because the lack of LTE.</p>
<p>I am so glad that T-Mobile&#8217;s DC HSPA+ is available in my area. So I am definitely buying this phone.</p>
<p>I love love love the way this thing looks. Not giving away my iphone just yet. The 5 beats the looks anyways. Oh and Android.. That shit. Let&#8217;s build a stable OS and forget about laggy customizations. Call me a sheep. I am not. I would buy an android if they&#8217;d fix their OS. It will be a Nexus.</p>
<p>The OS is stable, some of the apps you have the option of installing are not.<br />
Android is like having the option to wear a condom<br />
IOS is like having the snip</p>
<p>The lack of LTE doesn&#8217;t really kill me. It seems where ever I go there is open  WiFi. I can wait a bit to get to my destination to download something <em>fast</em>. 4g is more than fast enough for Pandora, Google Music and Facebook browsing by my standards.</p>
<p>How is the  music clarity when compared to the S3 when listened via headphonesJosh could u clarify</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so glad this review has more comments on it than the iPad Mini review.</p>
<p>This portion of the review could be renamed the &#8216;Justifications and Excuses&#8217; section.</p>
<p>This phone rocks ! No LTE, so what ?</p>
<p>Personally, on reading that it has no expansion slot, and a non-removable battery, I tot.. iphone?</p>
<p>This is not a perfect phone. But a few things bother me.</p>
<p>1.) when the iPhone didn&#8217;t have LTE, that was no biggie. Don&#8217;t need it. Now that the iPhone has LTE, phones without LTE are stupid.</p>
<p>2.) when the iPhone had a glass back, that was the hallmark of advanced industrial design and expensive, premium build quality. You simply needed to pay attention to what you do with your premium superphone. Now that the iPhone doesn&#8217;t have a glass back, using glass is an unwise decision because it will lead to breakage.</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t shake the feeling that Apple goes where the puck is going because some people define the puck as going to where Apple goes. That means that the goalposts get moved every time Apple moves &#8211; no matter in which direction they move.</p>
<p>If the next Nexus has a metal unibody and the next iPhone gets a plastic body and plastic screen, the next Nexus will be prone to a denting back and breaking screen because of a questionable design decision to use sensitive materials while the next iPhone will be ideal because you can take it everywhere and it can&#8217;t break.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying the review is biased &#8211; it seems rather balanced to me. What I&#8217;ve just said has just occurred to me as a general trend in perception: whatever Apple does is right. If they turn around and do something else tomorrow, THAT is the new right and everybody who does what Apple did yesterday is wrong.</p>
<p>Just to clarify: I wouldn&#8217;t get a Nexus 4 even if I was up for an update &#8211; because it has a glass back and I fully agree that glass is not a smart material to use.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only saying that before the Nexus 4 had a glass back, glass was considered a premium material&#8230; while it is now, all of a sudden, considered silly. And that strikes me as a bit weird. People were for it before they were against it. There&#8217;s too much partisan politics in this smartphone platform war.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re remembering it correctly. The Verge&#8217;s iPhone 4S review named both the lack of LTE and the glass back as shortcomings and listed under &#8220;Bad Stuff&#8221;:</p>
<p>- Improved 3G speeds don’t seem very improved, especially compared to LTE devices</p>
<p>- Glass and metal design is beautiful, but easy to shatter</p>
<p>The comment section was far less polite and gave the iPhone 4(S) a proper flogging on those two counts.</p>
<p>1.) when the iPhone didn’t have LTE, that was no biggie. Don’t need it. Now that the iPhone has LTE, phones without LTE are stupid.<blockquote></blockquote></p>
<p>LTE coverage and 1st gen chipset battery life were a joke a when the 4S was released.   The 2 hour battery life on the lte gnex as reported by the verge supports that.   fast forward to late 2012 and LTE coverage is in most major cities now.  I just got back from a trip to LA and Vegas.  I had LTE in both places. with a high of 36 down and 22 up in speed test.  When the 4S came out there was no LTE where I live.</p>
<blockquote>2.) when the iPhone had a glass back, that was the hallmark of advanced industrial design and expensive, premium build quality. You simply needed to pay attention to what you do with your premium superphone. Now that the iPhone doesn’t have a glass back, using glass is an unwise decision because it will lead to breakage.</blockquote>
<p>Glass is still premium.  all 3 models of iphone on the market still have glass on the back  4, 4s and 5.  If anything your quote shows the  imitation and hypocrisy of the android crowd.  I may not remember everything but I certainly remember the comments about the 4s having a glass back.  Now these same people are saying it&#8217;s not so important to most android users.</p>
<p>want this phone! don&#8217;t care much about glass backs and lack of LTE&#8230;</p>
<p>Its made of glass and it breaks..  Fuck!</p>
<p>Reception and call quality gets a final rating of &#8220;6&#8221;, yet it was described as &#8220;excellent&#8221; in the review? Is this because it lacked LTE or because of the one dropped call?</p>
<p>Lack of LTE&#8230; reception includes data speeds</p>
<p>There is no LTE because LTE, though a new standard in the US, is operated on a huge range of frequencies and requires a different radio per carrier. That&#8217;s why the Galaxy S2 had so many different models, and why so many phones come with several different models. Creating 4-5 different models to use LTE on different carriers would have increased cost of production for LG, not to mention the cost of the additional technology. I was upset about no LTE, but I&#8217;m waiting on it to get more widespread. If, in 7 months, it is more widespread and a must have, I&#8217;ll renew my contract with AT&amp;T and sell this online. No loss for me.<br />
Though I would like to point out the hypocrisy of many other Android users (I am an Android lover, so this is not a bashing) saying that &#8220;No LTE is a smart move&#8221;. Most of us hated on iPhone when the 4S came out with no LTE, saying it&#8217;s lagging in technology. So let&#8217;s at least be fair..</p>
<p>Also, the glass back and front problem is not really a problem. Most everybody uses a case with their phone, I honestly don&#8217;t know anyone that doesn&#8217;t use one. Therefore, your screen is protected. Invest in a decent case that has shock absorption, use screen protectors and move on with your life.<br />
I just want to know what the battery life is REALLY like&#8230; everyone else but the Verge says it sucks.</p>
<p>I am an MVNO for T-mobile for one reason: it&#8217;s cheap. $49 a month cheap. 4 gig soft cap, unlimited everything else. I wonder what AT&amp;T would charge for that on LTE?</p>
<p>I have gotten as high as a little over 8Megbit / second on the Galaxy Nexus, which isn&#8217;t even a 42Mbit/second phone. It&#8217;s 21, IIRC.</p>
<p>Yes, a little faster would be nicer on my GNex, but the LG should really be fine most of the time. I know, I know, but I&#8217;m going to ask: what would you do on a phone with 25Mb real world speeds?</p>
<p>Whatever verge says, I&#8217;m not buying anything built by LG!</p>
<p>4 times he said lack of LTE&#8230;<br />
I would like to see small documentary what lte can do for him.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really agree with the LTE part&#8230; while it would be cool to have every options in the device; I now have a device with LTE on rogers network. Other than giving better results on speedtest, it gave me nothing whatsoever&#8230; No new features or special capabilities&#8230;. My internet browsing experience is the same, &#8220;Sykping&#8221; feels the same&#8230; Facebook, the same&#8230;. so as far as user experience is concerned, everything is the same to me. This test must have been conducted in an area where LTE has less latency than HSPA+ &#8230; &#8216;cause here, both respond about the same on my old Nexus S and my new Lumia 900 &#8230; So here, in Montreal, as long as you have either HSPA+ or LTE on the device you plan on buying, you&#8217;re in business.</p>
<p>I am excited to see what sort of speeds I will be getting on T-Mobile&#8217;s HSPA+ 42Mbps connection here in Los Angeles. Having never owned a phone capable of the 42Mbps version of HSPA+, I am not really sure what to expect but I would be happy with consistently getting 10Mb down and 3Mb. If I relied on the data connection heavily as some do for tethering their tablet or laptop for work/school purposes, I might weigh the non-LTE factor more heavily but for me since I have Wi-Fi in most places I go, HSPA+ 42 should more then suffice.</p>
<p>even if you tether i doubt anyone need 10mb down. Most home wireless connection isn&#8217;t as fast as 10mb neways.</p>

<p>This thread with my settings set to default expand comments completely locks up my browser. I had to change the settings before i could even get down to the comments lol</p>
<p>my first and my best smart phone. for sure :D</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t the score be 8.5 even with the 6 bringing down the score?</p>
<p>Great review, my wife is in the market for a new phone and I&#8217;m not sure she wants another iPhone. This really helped with our decision.</p>
<p>I plan to buy the Nexus 4 upon release. <br />
The fact that it does not have LTE is of no concern of mine. This phone has absolutely every feature I want, including the clean, modest styling. Nothing beats the pure Google Android Experience like a Nexus model. I do believe that once they are out, and people witness how well they perform even without LTE, the demand will grow even stronger. This is one very good smartphone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand how you could bash a phones data speed WITHOUT TESTING on the carrier it was designed for. The verge even has an article about how Tmo users can actually use their data more, despite being somewhat slower. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/16/3090505/t-mobile-hspa-plus-customers-twice-the-data" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/16/3090505/t-mobile-hspa-plus-customers-twice-the-data</a></p>
<p>If you leave any metropolitan area, you will be stuck with old school 3G on every other carrier then TMobile. &#8220;The largest 4G network&#8221; is not just baselase advertising, its really, the fastest internet for most people in the US.</p>
<p>Not to mention that this phone supports 42MBPS, where AT&amp;T&#8217;s network is weakest. This review is heavily biased towards AT&amp;T users, probably not intentionally.</p>
<p>Any smartphone if you trop form 30&quot; or more will have damage to it!  That what a cover is for!  The Verge should of point this out!</p>
<p>would it support usb otg ?? its really needed since it doesn&#8217;t have a card slot&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus does, the Nexus 7 does, so the Nexus 4 should too. It&#8217;s a basic functionality now that I don&#8217;t think Google will take away. Or so I hope :D</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel any hesitation in saying that the pure Android 4.2 experience is — at least in my estimation — the most advanced mobile operating system on the market&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh no, Apple said iOS is the most advanced mobile operating system in the world, so which market is Android in? :P</p>
<p>(Android fan here)</p>
<p>Oh no, Apple said iOS 6, that stale and boring upgrade was the greatest thing in forevers, obviously they&#8217;re right :) Apple also said I should chop off my left nut, so I did :D GO APPLE!! WOO!!</p>
<p>trolling is a bliss</p>
<p>So, LTE is in it&#8217;s infancy in the UK, I have a carpet on my dining room floor, and I&#8217;m colour blind. Looks like this phone is 10/10 for me!</p>
<p>If they had made the back Plastic Like the Nexus 10, I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve cared all that much.</p>
<p>Suppose to be a Mobile phone&#8230;And receive 6 in Reception/Call Quality???? I&#8217;d rather prefer a tablet then&#8230;</p>
<p>Currently playing the refresh game with the play store&#8230;.</p>
<p>Same here, hope it goes on sale at 12 A.M. PST.</p>
<p>If we cannot score one tonight, will they be on sale tomorrow at Staples?</p>
<p>I hate this phone and everything about (except that it runs Android)</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s so ironic when all these phone makers in 2008 were touting OLED and AMOLED screens as superior to anything before, and now they&#8217;re all switching back to LCD because everyone hated them. Really doesn&#8217;t make me wanting to believe them in any kind of future insight about, pretty much, anything.</p>
<p>Everyone is pretty strong, I love my Galaxy S screen, everyone that views it says how beautiful it is. (one of the many reasons I still have it)</p>
<p>No sd slot again? Really Google?<br />
	<br />
I really can&#8217;t wrap my head around phones not having external storage, I&#8217;d never buy a phone w/o sd slot or some equivalent add on storage.</p>
<p>The reason is simple</p>
<p>Memory management is better without SD  cards</p>
<p>and speed. SD cards are slow.</p>
<p>The battery can not be removed an article wrote it last about 800 cycles&#8230;then what ?!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s removable, just not I will the sense your thinking of. It can still be replaced.</p>
<p>Fixed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the US, a flagship phone without LTE is like trying to drive a muscle car down a abandoned service road that the owner has never bothered to properly build or maintain. This is clearly Googles fault and not ours as customers for not demanding our carriers don&#8217;t screw us with shitty networks.&#8221;</p>
<p>All sold out everywhere in the world in the shortest amount of time.  Not worth complaining because you can&#8217;t even get one now to complain about.</p>
<p>No LTE isn&#8217;t a deal breaker. I&#8217;d prefer battery life over download speeds.  Seeing as all everyone bitches about is poor battery life I thought this word be a blessing. Like you&#8217;re going to download 1.1Gb of FIFA 12 over LTE anyway&#8230;.</p>
<p>Google, I like you, but you fucked up. No LTE, glass back, no expandable memory, 16GB memory max internal storage, and no removable battery. What reason should I get this over the HTC Droid DNA or Samsung Galaxy Note II?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s half the price. If you really care about those features, just get another phone. You don&#8217;t need to complain about it. Choose and move on.</p>
<p>both phones are too big for some users. i dont care for lte. i have hspa and im happy with it. i use the cloud for music and turn on pandora otherwise. battery is an issue, however. but dna battery blows. and samsung has touchballz.</p>
<p>but mostly&#8230; 300 dollars cheaper and no contract. boo ya. google+1</p>
<p>1,800 comments <del>-wow</del>- so I don&#8217;t know if another commented on this. The ratings should also take into account the sales and service as these are more divergent than previous phones. I read one guy&#8217;s miserable experience trying to get his twenty day old phone serviced. I want to know if that is the poor service I need to expect if I buy this phone.</p>
<p>google is notorious for horrendous customer service. shipping issues, and lack of support for sure. that being said, i still would prefer this phone over a Samsung. I just cant see myself with the GS3 despite its awesomely bright screen. In my experience, customer service for an android device is best receieved when purchased through a carrier and insured. With my S2, I had to send it into samsung, didnt receive it for quite a while and then was told there was nothing wrong with it. Both Microsoft and Apple however, have stupendously amazing service. And as much as I have hated them in the past, this year really turned things around for me.</p>
<p>Wait, humm so the BACKCOVER made with Gorilla Glass is now something to worry about? And what about the iPhone 4 and 4s ?</p>
<p>Any sort of glass is vulnerable to breaking. Gorilla Glass is scratch resistant, not shatter proof.<br />
And everyone called out the glass back of the iPhone as a bad idea at the time &#8211; now Apple has moved away from that design, yet LG and Google think it&#8217;s a good idea <strong>facepalm</strong></p>
<p>Retraction request:<br />
How could you say &quot;In the US, a flagship phone without LTE is like a muscle car with no wheels. &quot;<br />
When I&#8217;m getting 22mbps on Tmo&#8217;s 4G network, you tested on AT&amp;T&#8217;s&#8230; notoriously 4 to 5 times slower.</p>
<p><strong>This is such an awesome phone!</strong> Unlocked GSM, powerful processor and HSPA+ to fully take advantage of unlimited 4G data, talk &amp; txt with Solavei (through T-Mobile). That&#8217;s what I get for only $49/mo or less! :) Check out the 1-min video intro at: <a href="http://PenniesOverDollars.com" target="new">www.PenniesOverDollars.com</a></p>
<p>Well played Google! Although I see this playing out (at least on Verizon) like the Google Wallet fiasco. Also remember their GS2 shipped with NFC, but was enabled months later when ISIS was going live. Good on you Google for providing the LTE hardware and attempting to sidestep carriers, but I see a battle with them getting them to support it, especially big red.</p>
<p>I agree with the score. I do not really care about LTE. But this phone has a big problem in my opinion. Memory is not enough by a long shot. 16gb max is sad. and no microsd is even sadder.</p>
<p>We are heading towards a full-hd world, with phones that might as well become the next media player, with games reaching the gb size, and having such a small amount of memory is really stupid.</p>
<p>Now that it is confirmed: Nexus 4 is LTE -Capable, <br />
shouldn&#8217;t Verge update the Review and the Score?</p>
<p>All that LTE talk is just pointless. There is no need for LTE because of the data caps. I&#8217;m in Canada and my nexus 4 does have LTE. I turned it on and got 55mbps down 22mbps up. But in the 5 seconds it took to do the benchmark I went thought 15% of my monthly data cap&#8230; How stupid is that? So I just turned out back off. Unless data caps are in the 10GB+ range it&#8217;s not worth it. The average customer will have a similar plan than mine which is why Google didn&#8217;t bother with LTE. Also, currently the average page size is about a Meg which is about 2 seconds of HSPA+ speed. Yes LTE is the future but we are in the present and in a year from now, there will be a new Nexus phone that will crush the Nexus 4 in every way&#8230;</p>
<p>Best review I have seen so far for nexus 4. Thanks so much for this coverage!</p>
<p>N4 is LTE capable bro. Please don&#8217;t end the review with that.</p>
<p>Thought, The Nexus 4 purchased from the Play store on T-mobile &#8216;s unlimited 4g plan overrides the stipulation of not being able to add tethering, because you can do this out of the box with the unlocked Nexus 4 . I wonder if it comes this way from T-Mobile or if they had their way with the device before it shipped to stores? Can anyone clear the air for me, as I got my N4  from the Play store and tethering works fine. Just curious and thought I&#8217;d point that out.</p>
<p><strong>Anybody know what wallpaper the review phone has?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://crowquills.com/#" target="_blank">http://crowquills.com/#</a><br />
You can find it there.</p>
<p>I really want the Nexus 4, but in my country it isn&#8217;t available, but I know someone in the UK, is it possible to get it from UK, but with EU socket?</p>
<p>Does this phone has <strong>WiFi Hotspot</strong> capability?.  I did not find it mentioned in the specs.</p>
<p>I believe it has, new phones usually have it, and as the Nexus 4 has to be the best Android phone, then it should have the capability.</p>
<p>Just received my Nexus 4 !!</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t get why in the world this phone wouldn&#8217;t be packed with 4GLTE with AT&amp;T or any other carrier. How shortsighted! I&#8217;m a graphics designer in New York and love the phone&#8217;s style but really would need good data speed to transmit graphic files. And photos. Who wouldn&#8217;t need it?</p>
<p>Hi, wonder if anyone could help!<br />
I have a Nexus 4 16GB, not a scratch or a mark in sight. <br />
However, there is some plastic stuck right down in my headphone jack! Any ideas how to get it out safely? I seen suggestions of super glue but to be honest i don&#8217;t think that sounds very clever&#8230; <br />
I find it a brilliant phone, no problems until now! I need to get it fixed!</p>
<p>guys if someone is ready to sell their nexus 4 and ship it internationally I&rsquo;d be happy to buy it. Let me know <code>&lt;a href="mailto:vishalponugoti</code>gmail.com" target="_blank"&gt;vishalponugoti@gmail.com</p>

<p>So even the part when they created an entirely new category in consumer electronics 3 years ago with the iPad didn&rsquo;t impress you? Too dull? Wow.</p>
<p>When did that ever happen? The iPod is still the best selling MP3 player, the iPhone is still the best selling smart phone and the iPad is still the best selling tablet. Your version of history has no basis in fact.</p>
<p>I have a dream&hellip;<br />
That one day I&rsquo;ll be able to see my notifications by simply glancing. No more shall I have to take the phone out of my pocket, turn it on, then unlock just to see a text message.<br />
That some day, I can reply to an email with one click using voice control.<br />
That in the future, I can do local searches by voice with one press of a button from my wrist.<br />
That I can take a call, either on speaker or through earbuds, with one press of a button.<br />
That one day, Google Now cards will show up on my wrist and I don&rsquo;t have to unlock my phone and open an app to see them.</p>
<p>This is all possible through communicating with a phone by bluetooth 4.0. I hope for a color e-ink screen that has all week battery life.</p>
<p>You need to broaden your horizons a little. Dr King is rotating in his grave as we speak.</p>
<p>8/10 would read again</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>That just made me want to flush my phone down the toilet.  My next phone will be a Jitterbug.</p>
<p>I think it would be a really great device if it could also directly collect your heartrate data and <span class="caps">GPS</span>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;d be an app for that!</p>
<p>I think it would absolutely be a &ldquo;life-monitoring&rdquo; device. Smart heartrate monitors/accelerometers that are always on and can measure activity as well as sleep. Lots of buzz in this sector, right now. Of course it would obviously serve as a secondary display/remote control for all iOS devices. The future of Bluetooth 4.0 is looking promising. It used to be a huge battery hog that was riddled with bugs, but now it&rsquo;s looking great!</p>
<p>So you could avoid places that make your heart rate go up?</p>
<p>I think the <span class="caps">NYT</span> has seen this link and guessed the rest: <a href="http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/" target="_blank">http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/</a></p>
<p>Is that similar to the dream of the 90s that is alive in Portland, OR?</p>
<p>I hope they put a bird on the watch!<br /><img title="PUT A BIRD ON IT" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1vpdhpBV01r8sqg0o1_500.gif" alt="PUT A BIRD ON IT" /></p>
<p>You can retire in your twenties, if you get this watch!</p>
<p><img src="http://while.apparelbookstore.info/ago.jpg" /> not the only place where dream of nano is alive however.</p>
<p>With Liquid Metal ?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/spirit/watchmaking/liquidmetal" target="_blank">http://www.omegawatches.com/spirit/watchmaking/liquidmetal</a></p>
<p>Sounds like a good idea.  The effort from Pebble can easily be improved upon.  It&rsquo;s a useful concept Pebble was unable to fully realize, for monetary or whatever reasons.  Apple can absolutely improve.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d still rather have Google Glass.  But this watch will be a nice stepping stone.</p>
<p>Pebble watch is a really bad concept that can <strong>easily</strong> be trumphed by someone used to manufacturing. Pebble watch lasts mere days and it needs to be charged up again, I have always wondered why no one just makes a decent smartphone watch because the current watches are absolute garbage. I can&rsquo;t believe I am so excited about a rumour.</p>
<p>At least the pebbles battery life can be measured in days. The biggest problem with it is materials. It needs more resilient material like stainless steel and glass watch face. Possibly input methods too, but buttons are okay.  The screen is probably the best available right now for the price and longevity.</p>
<p>I would say it was a success in its own right. Also they seem to be the ones getting the larger companies to start thinking realistically about smart watches. They might not finish on top but they got the ball rolling faster then anyone else. That&rsquo;s impressive on its own.</p>
<p>It is an impressive startup but no one will remember Pebble 2 years from now. Apple changed their nano precisely for this reason &ndash; so competitors would introduce smart watches and Apple could learn from their mistakes. They will introduce the world to smart watches on a big way leaving only a few scattered geeks yelling about how Pebble did it first.</p>
<p>I agree with you to some degree. I doubt Apple held off on making a smart watch to learn from Pebble&rsquo;s mistakes. That&rsquo;s just ludicrous. What ever Apple touches doesnt automatically turn into gold. Their are plenty of other companies trying in this smart watch market.</p>
<p>&hellip;what? I&rsquo;m sure Apple/Google could improve&hellip;but look at the MotoACTV &ndash; a <span class="caps">GPS</span> watch that has terrible battery life &ndash; even with the <span class="caps">GPS</span> off.</p>
<p>Normal wristwatches last as long as they do because they use barely any power. Some are even just powered by the motion of your wrist. You aren&rsquo;t going to power even the slowest <span class="caps">ARM</span> cpu with that little energy.</p>
<p>And what about a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-working-on-a-smart-watch-of-its-own-2013-1">Google smartwatch</a> ?</p>
<p>concept though it seems, there&rsquo;s actually not many decent smart watches out there really, the pebble yeah, but it&rsquo;s crap</p>
<p>Concept?<br />
You only looked at the first image then, read the article.</p>
<p>I should have said_ not currently available_ perhaps.</p>
<p>Ummm&hellip; yeah, just like the Apple one or Google Glass.<br />
Maybe didn&rsquo;t you notice that my post wasn&rsquo;t a reply to you.</p>
<p>I want to believe, but it&rsquo;s Business Insider we&rsquo;re quoting here. :/</p>
<p>The original story is from the <span class="caps">NYT</span>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know them, do you have a good reason to think that they aren&rsquo;t reliable?</p>
<p>Reliable or not, I think the <span class="caps">NYT</span> and the other very recent pieces have been in response to this piece by an ex-Apple employee: <a href="http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/" target="_blank">http://asktog.com/atc/apple-iwatch/</a></p>
<p>No, you (and Mad Stan too?) didn&rsquo;t get it, jiminycracken replied to my post about a Google smartwatch, with a link to a Business Insider article.</p>
<p>No. </p>
<p>I agree. I&rsquo;ve been hoping for an apple iWatch of sorts for years. I hope it&rsquo;s going to happen even if I don&rsquo;t trust anything the <span class="caps">NYT</span> has to report. They&rsquo;ve had a very spotty record as of late and lazy journalism.</p>
<p>Then brace yourself for the hordes of baboons complaining that Apple &ldquo;ripped off Pebble&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As a Pebble backer, I partially agree. Apple can easily dominate in this market as soon as they enter. However, I have no regrets with backing the Pebble. One, it provides me with a useful product now, even if the idea has more potential than the Pebble can execute. Two, hopefully it&rsquo;s the stepping stone that proves to the big players that there is a viable market here.</p>
<p>The biggest nice to have feature for the Pebble would be mic input. Both iOS and Android are getting better and better at voice input, so it&rsquo;s a logical progression, especially given the limited input capabilities of a watch.</p>
<p>I will never wear a Google Glass in public. Sorry but it&rsquo;s just looks too dorky.</p>
<p>And for what? To constantly get bombarded with even more information? Or to not having to look at your wrist because that&rsquo;s such a huge effort?</p>
<p>Google Glass is a real cool concept. And I&rsquo;m sure it has it&rsquo;s applications where it really comes in handy. Like for example warehouse order picking, military, a mobile teleprompter. But for actual mainstream usage I don&rsquo;t believe the Google Glass concept is going anywhere.</p>
<p>Smart watches are the way to go here.</p>
<p>Wearable computing could be a big thing, nice to see Apple is paying attention.</p>
<p>You must be missing something&hellip; they could have had 100% of the smart-watch market by adding Bluetooth to the <span class="caps">NANO</span> 2 years ago,so much for paying attention.</p>
<p>The nano was an mo3 player, that was its function.  If apple wants a watch, it makes a watch.  They get too involved in the hybrid business.</p>
<p>If they had added bluetooth along with notifications syncing/ipod control then they really would have been onto something.</p>
<p>My guess is that instead of releasing a crappy hybrid they pulled the nano and are going to release it as a totally new product.</p>
<p>But that would still be missing the main &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of a watch &ndash; telling time.</p>
<p>I had a &ldquo;nano-watch&rdquo; for a month or so and it was terrible at that because there was a noticeable delay when pressing the power button and seeing the clock display. Any other watch just requires a glance at your wrist, this required two hands and half a second. It would need some kind of reflective display that works in normal lighting along with a backlight for dark situations so the display is always visible.</p>
<p>The biggest feature an Apple watch would have is Siri control. Just a simple double tap and you can send a text or have it read your email. Or check the weather. Or create a reminder. Right now you can do all that with your phone, but it requires use of your hands to take your phone out and hold down the home button which means you have already wasted 4-5 seconds. Also you are already holding your phone so in many occasions you can perform the task faster on the touchscreen. With a watch you can continue typing on a computer for example&hellip;while interacting with Siri.</p>
<p>They need to utilize an accelerometer so that a simple flick of the wrist turns the display on. No need for the display to remain on, if nobody&rsquo;s looking at it.</p>
<p>Simply adding bluetooth to the Nano wouldn&rsquo;t have given them &ldquo;100% of the smart-watch market&rdquo;. It was an MP3 player with a watch face. No framework existed for notifications or working with other devices. Yes, it was surprisingly popular to strap a Nano onto your wrist. But it&rsquo;s not like they had anything in the bag.</p>
<p>I suspect they took the square Nano off the market so they could work on it for a few more years in the labs and come out with something compelling and useful down the road.</p>
<p>A strap + Bluetooth + software updates and they would have <span class="caps">OWNED</span> that market. in fact they would have been said to <span class="caps">DEFINE</span> that market.</p>
<p>Clearly not the definition of the market that Apple wanted.</p>
<p>Yeah if company want to milk customers, they have to have separate-one purpose, products</p>
<p>You mean tgey should make an iphone nano watch?  Logic failed?</p>
<p>So Apple should add phone calls to the 10" iPad and discontinue all other products, and have a watch band for it so you have a 10" touch screen watch?</p>
<p>and yet here we are.</p>
<p>What about battery life and all of those features necessary to make the watch smart? Apple pulled nanos because they&rsquo;re not targeting this as a hobby. They want to introduce it in a big way with most of the kinks out. They also don&rsquo;t want to be first to market. I only wish Samsung would make the first move but we know that will never happen.</p>
<p>Exactly. They want it lauded as a groundbreaking new device category. One that&rsquo;s wearable, works unbelievably beautifully with all of your existing products, and one that feels &ldquo;finished&rdquo;. Beta launches don&rsquo;t work out well for companies, usually. Devices that aren&rsquo;t good at launch will sour the taste in everyone&rsquo;s mouth. Especially when it&rsquo;s Apple, and things like antenna problems that don&rsquo;t even exist are front page news.</p>
<p>I think they still will.  I don&rsquo;t think the nano was capable enough.  I think they need a faster processor capable of running iOS.  The iPod is very limited.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a matter of defining the product.</p>
<p>not having things like expandable memory of a removable battery have not hindered iphones or ipads. apple has defined the product as not configurable, not upgradeable (except at the behest of apple).</p>
<p>they could have defined the nano similarly. feature deprived? No. It&rsquo;s beautifully simple. and they add features at a later date.</p>
<p>Apple isn&rsquo;t averse to releasing unfinished product &ndash; they just usually have a great marketing angle for it.</p>
<p>Compared to the competition, they generally launch <span class="caps">VERY</span> polished products, and just as importantly, they&rsquo;re shipping within a couple weeks of their announcement.</p>
<p>not sure where I used polished.</p>
<p>I said <span class="caps">UNFINISHED</span>. Nor did I mention shipping anywhere.</p>
<p>you wanna bring up packaging as well?</p>
<p>Apple must not have thought it was a particularly good watch, now that they&rsquo;ve seen the demand, they&rsquo;re going to make a proper one. That&rsquo;s what I gather.</p>
<p>No.  It&rsquo;s clear they killed be square nano to clear the way for a watch.  The nano runs iPod software not iOS.  I believe they watch will run (some version of) actual iOS in order to support apps.<br />
I believe battery an processor might have been the limitation so far.  If they can get iOS to fit in a watch with all the necessary radios (Bluetooth, wifi) and sensors (gyro, accel, compas) then they have a product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about darn time.  Apple need this to strengthen the iPhone.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t make a product if they don&rsquo;t think the technology can pull it off well, especially if no one else is coming to market with anything big.  Google Glasses is awesome looking, and I will certainly pick a set up launch day regardless of price, but it&rsquo;s a ways off.  A better efficiency screen, low powered bluteooth, and some small chips for efficiency will open up a nice product.</p>
<p>There is a smart-watch market? Even if there is or was one, it&rsquo;d be microscopic. Solely tacking on technology upon technology is not going to succeed; that&rsquo;s what the competition does. There must be an element of human connection and what&rsquo;s where Apple succeeds better than anyone. MP3 players existed before the iPod but the iPod really connected with people in ways no other device before it did. Likewise with the iPhone, the iPad, Macs too of course and if there is an Apple smart-watch you can bet it will be likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be an element of human connection and what&rsquo;s where Apple succeeds better than anyone&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re absolutely right, and that&rsquo;s exactly when smartwatches will succeed. It&rsquo;s wearable, it&rsquo;s fashionable, and it&rsquo;s absolutely the product that nobody ever knew they would need (like the iPhone was, when they launched the smartphone revolution).</p>
<p>And better battery life. And take the back clip easily. And have an easy way to charge it. And have notification support. And have a vibration function&hellip;</p>
<p>I think you are missing a few steps here.</p>
<p>Wearable computing <span class="caps">WILL</span> be a big thing</p>
<p>I have some money stored just for if something cool in the wearable smartwatch department comes along. I hope this rumor is true.</p>
<p>Yeah. I&rsquo;d even settle for a decent arm-band holder for my phone that I could strap above my wrist. I wouldn&rsquo;t have to keep taking it out of my pocket. To Hell with it &ndash; I might make one. But I&rsquo;d like to see a professional take on it. Something that could ideally move from my inner arm (for protection) to outer arm (for looking at, working with) and easy to clip it in and out of. Lock the screen orientation and I have half of what I need. I already have the Bluetooth headset.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always felt that not releasing an &#8220;iWatch&#8221; years ago when people were wearing nanos was a huge missed opportunity for Apple.</p>
<p>The technology wasn&rsquo;t available for it to be possible with such things like Bluetooth 4.0 coming about only recently.</p>
<p>The technology wasn&rsquo;t available for it to be possible with such things like Bluetooth 4.0 coming about only recently.</p>
<p>available? why not try and make something for a change.</p>
<p>It just doesn&#8217;t exist in the way they would like. I&#8217;m sure they require it to be a color touchscreen. The nano would have terrible battery life if it was always on. And because the nano had to be activated, it was deeply flawed as a watch, disregarding the fact it wasn&#8217;t connected in any way.</p>
<p>A mirasol display that is actually decent is something that would make this happen. A watch needs to have an always on display and at least a week of battery life for it to be worthwhile. The only one to pull this off is pebble and its probably the best that can be made today, besides the quality of the materials. Until then, no one should bother.</p>
<p>Maybe that is what they are doing.  Talking Shit is quick, actual doing things take time</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, if the rumors are true, then Apple sure <em>IS</em> making something. And it will be better and groundbreaking.</p>
<p>You forgot the /s</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t ceded that market to anyone, so that opportunity still exists. Nothing has been missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt that not releasing an &ldquo;iWatch&rdquo; years ago when people were wearing nanos was a huge missed opportunity for Apple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the door&rsquo;s nowhere near closed. Nobody&rsquo;s really wearing smartwatches. Yet.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OMFG</span>, it sounds like they&rsquo;re stealing my concept :-D</p>
<p>Yes. I&rsquo;m sure Apple is stealing your concepts, iPav.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t get I was joking.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure most peole didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Yes, the smiley face is heretofore unknown.</p>
<p>Going backwards to watch form factor where the main distractor is you have to look away from your normal field of view to use.  Google Shades form factor make much more sense.</p>
<p>What do think is going to be more expensive: New type of a watch or an augmented reality headset?</p>
<p>People will pay a premium for functional and useful.  That&rsquo;s like asking what&rsquo;s more expensive, walky talky or cellular phone.</p>
<p>Which is why Pebble is boned if this rumor is true. Project Glass doesn&rsquo;t have a coolness problem but a pricing one instead. Even if a pair will only run you a few hundred bucks they&rsquo;ll be asking customers to chose between a new Android phone/tablet and the Glass. That&rsquo;s no different than how the iPad eventually ate Mac sales.</p>
<p>Bob, the future gen android &lsquo;phone&rsquo; will be the Google Glass.  Hence the nexus name.</p>
<p>Nexus:  connection (or series of connections) linking two or more things</p>
<p>The nexus line of products links us from traditional mobile phones and desktop computers to the future of computing &ndash; augmented reality</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why Sergey Brin and many googlers are dogfooding the glass right now like crazy &ndash; it&rsquo;s the future interface for the internet, and the world, together in one.</p>
<p>This is the awesome thing:  If Google pulls it off, I buy their setup and enjoy.  Huge upside to the consumers here.  I just don&rsquo;t know how long I trust Google.  They know <span class="caps">EVERYTHING</span> about me, as far as I am on the internet.  Which is all day.</p>
<p>as far as google goes I think it&rsquo;s very important to encourage competitors.</p>
<p><span class="caps">VERY</span> <span class="caps">IMPORTANT</span>.</p>
<p>unlike stuff like apple which allows evangelism to proceed unchecked &ndash; google is an extremely dangerous entity that puts thousands of miles between itself and its competitors every day.</p>
<p>nothing will be able to check google other than itself. not the government. no regulations. and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</p>
<p>so on my work machines and laptops/tablets I always launch google, bing, and wolfram alpha whenever I open my browser. unfortunately after those three I find there&rsquo;s a pretty steep drop off in terms of value (obviously yahoo has been outsourcing its search, etc.).</p>
<p>I think the intelligent web denizen spreads his informational wealth online whenever he can &ndash; because he&rsquo;s literally giving away his power with every keystroke. doesn&rsquo;t make sense to give it all to one guy.</p>
<p>Normal people will pay a premium not to look like complete and utter berks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People will pay a premium for functional and useful. That&rsquo;s like asking what&rsquo;s more expensive, walky talky or cellular phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A premium wearable display that doesn&rsquo; make you look like a cyborg will cost upwards of $2K at launch. The watch will be $199 or less. There are simply way more people who can pay $199 for a toy than those who can dish out $2K+</p>
<p>Knowing Apple probably the watch.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re saying that it wouldn&rsquo;t be distracting to have pop-ups of information while driving or operating heavy machinery?</p>
<p>Location awareness like <span class="caps">NFC</span> but with bluetooth, visual recognition, speed, etc. to automatically adjust notification level.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re asking a lot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>visual recognition, speed, etc. to automatically adjust notification level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically a driver needs his full range of vision to drive accurately. How does it help to have directions there constantly or to have a popup for a turn to surprise you? Most people are already bad drivers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that glasses aren&rsquo;t the future but there are a lot of issues yet to be solved that exist in the real world. This is not something to be solved in the short term that will ship very shortly.</p>
<p>Have the car drive itself?</p>
<p>To be honest it might actually help those terrible drivers. Now instead of holding their cell phone in their lap and texting while driving with their knees they can instead be looking out the windshield and dictating.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s asking for too much from you but fighter pilots have adapted and benefited from <span class="caps">HUD</span> traveling at much greater speeds and with an additional axis to deal with.</p>
<p>Fighter pilots are also the cream of the crop and have years of training behind them with each being a minimum of military captain. A little different then your average 16 year old with, at best, 20 hours of a driver training course under their belts.</p>
<p>Why do you call it &lsquo;Google Shades&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s &lsquo;Google Glass&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The base is pretty much a frame so in theory it could be lensless, with prescription lens, photochromic lens to serve as shades or ballistic lens for eye protection.</p>
<p>What about for those of us who don&#8217;t wear glasses? It would be nice to have a great looking smartwatch to wear while in the office (indoors).</p>
<p>Apple will cater to that dying niche market.</p>
<p>Yep, dying niche market, that hardly even has a mainstream presence&hellip;</p>
<p>like the dying market of smart phones and tablets right?</p>
<p>What is more likely to be adopted by the average joe? A discreet object on your wrist or a strange looking pair of glasses?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer the glasses but I&#8217;m the 1% (geeky Verge reader).</p>
<p>Depends on how useful the glasses are.</p>
<p>True, i was presuming similar features.</p>
<p>There is a simple rule here. If your teenage daughter is going to make fun of you wearing it, it isn&rsquo;t going mainstream.</p>
<p>And besides. Why do we need the glasses. Aren&rsquo;t we getting bombarded with information enough? Isn&rsquo;t looking on your wrist not already easy enough to see your notifications? And how much is anyone going to use that virtual reality stuff?</p>
<p>Google Glasses for geeks and Google Shades for the average cool Joe.</p>
<p>google glass makes more sense except for the part where the act of wearing the device itself is socially maladaptive.</p>
<p>all the prototypes I&rsquo;ve seen are going to need cultural shifts in order to make them viable. like all such new things &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be embraced by the young, unless it&rsquo;s expensive, and then it won&rsquo;t be embraced much at all except by fanboys (men).</p>
<p>A watch form factor makes a ton of sense &ndash; on demand. effortlessly with you all the time. with curved glass &ndash; you can actually play with scale and dimension i.e. it doesn&rsquo;t have to be watch sized &ndash; it can actually be smartphone sized, etc.</p>
<p>and a watch form factor isn&rsquo;t going &ldquo;backwards&rdquo; any more than google glasses is going backwards for relying on the concept of glasses or corrective lensing.</p>
<p><em>google glass makes more sense except for the part where the act of wearing the device itself is socially maladaptive.</em></p>
<p>Well, you can&rsquo;t accuse Google of not being aware of their target demographic&hellip;</p>
<p>Except no one wants to or cannot wear Google glass to bed, shower or swimming.</p>
<p>No one takes their phone or watch to the shower or swimming either but there&rsquo;ll be Google Goggles for that.</p>
<p>The Xperia Z would like to disagree.</p>
<p><img title="Sony Xperia Z in a bowl of water" src="http://blog.laptopmag.com/wpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sony-xperia-z-19-ss.jpg" alt="Sony Xperia Z in a bowl of water" /></p>
<p>There will be Google Goggles for taking a shower? Your ardent flame for Google has no bounds. All laughable of course.</p>
<p>Would you rather wear a watch all day or a headset?</p>

<p>Google Shades make more sense than a smart watch only in HotelQuebec&rsquo;s mind, a well-known ardent anti-Apple fanatic.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">FINALLY</span></strong> I have been waiting for so long for a decent watch, current smartwatches need to be charged after a few days, ridiculous. I hope Apple makes one that lasts a long ass time.</p>
<p>What if i dont have an iPhone? This would be a useless toy then.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an iOS accessory, there&rsquo;s a plenty big enough market out there for similarly &ldquo;constrained&rdquo; products.</p>
<p>if you market it as an accessory then its ok i guess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered a watch to be an accessory rather than an essential.</p>
<p>you do know that you&rsquo;re in the minority right?</p>
<p>Am I? How many people check the time on their phone rather than their wrist?<br />
Clocks and general timekeeping is essential, I don&rsquo;t think watches are.</p>
<p>taking your phone out from your pocket to check time. isn&rsquo;t that inconvenient?</p>
<p>Regardless, a lot of people still prefer to do that, in my experience.</p>
<p>I check the time, my emails and my texts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that if I&rsquo;m wearing my watch, it becomes the exclusive time-checking device.  If I&rsquo;m not, then it is back to pulling my phone out of my pocket.  I do prefer to wear my watch though since it ends up keeping me less distracted from my phone.</p>
<p>Not inconvenient enough for most people to give a damn. I stopped wearing my watch because I preferred nothing weighing down my wrist and if I really need to know the time &ndash; which is not often enough to have something stuck on my wrist all day just for that &ndash; I can just pull out my phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>taking your phone out from your pocket to check time. isn&rsquo;t that inconvenient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comment you were replying to was about whether watches are essential or accessories, not whether or not something was convenient.</p>
<p>I like the discreteness of a watch as well.  You can easily check the time without anyone in your meeting or discussion knowing that you would rather leave than listen to them.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m a punctual person. If I&rsquo;m supposed to be somewhere, I want to be there in time.  And having a watch helps that a lot.</p>
<p>Only if you check it 20 times a day. We are surrounded by clocks and people most of the day. When we are not surrounded by time telling devices, it usually means we don&rsquo;t need the time anyway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a few seconds.  Anyone who calls that an inconvenience is nitpicking.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s more about device #s. Why carry and maintain a 2nd device when the first device (at a very slight inconvenience) does what the dumbwatch does and more and better?</p>
<p>I used to never <span class="caps">NOT</span> wear a watch. Felt naked without it. Until cellphones became ubiquitous&hellip;. haven&rsquo;t worn a watch since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;taking your phone out from your pocket to check time. isn&rsquo;t that inconvenient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not to me.</p>
<p>Not as many as you think. Most people don&rsquo;t grab their smartphones or even dumbphones just to check the time. Not only is it horribly inconvenient, but watches for most people are, a fashion statement. Heck, it&rsquo;s the only legitimate piece of jewelry for a man.  Hmm, maybe unless Omega designed a smartwatch&hellip;</p>
<p>i think the same. these commenters above are probably Gen Z or something. I&rsquo;d never replace a Patek Phillipe with a plastic toy. Where i come from, people wearing even digital watches are mostly considered nerds.</p>
<p>Most people whom I personally know do not wear watches, so it&rsquo;s not the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Well no shit. No one is replacing a PP with a plastic toy.</p>
<p>Nor are they going to replace an <span class="caps">ALS</span>, an <span class="caps">IWC</span>, a UN, or any other high end watch with a smart watch.</p>
<p>The high end watch market is not a large one, however. I don&rsquo;t see a problem with a smart watch or even smart glasses becoming larger.</p>
<p>Your PP is the very definition of &ldquo;niche&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is what I wear on my wrist</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.racewatches.com/torgoen_info_bar.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>And one can do this while talking on the phone</p>

<p>Also cuff links.</p>
<p>How are piercings, necklaces, and finger rings not legitimate for a man?</p>
<p>How is a watch ever considered inconvenient?</p>
<p>Whenever I need the time, I instinctively look at my wrist. Then again since you think they are just fashion statements, you probably haven&rsquo;t really worn a watch for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Exactly.<br />
I started leaving my watch in the drawer after I bought my first mobile phone back in the 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Most people still wear watches mainly as a fashion accessory, just like most people I see with iPhones.</p>
<p>Most people you see with iPhones wear watches?  Interesting correlation.</p>
<p>I started to wear wrist watch again because it does its job better than any mobile device. You see time faster and other data as well if watch gives. And you dont need to recharge it or be afraid it gets broken so easily.</p>
<p>And yes&hellip; it can make you look sexier and whealthy&hellip;</p>
<p>no. I don&rsquo;t know anyone who considers a watch an essential. I work in finance and watches are accessories. men wear the most expensive watches they can afford because it&rsquo;s one of the easiest ways to communicate affluence.</p>
<p>I grew up with cell phones so there was never a point in my life where I actually needed a watch. From about 9 or so I had a cell phone.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That makes me feel old.</p>
<p>I stopped wearing watches when I got a cell phone, but I might get an iWatch, depending on the price.</p>
<p>It really depends on who you are. If this watch came with an accurate heart rate monitor then I could see it becoming widely used (or a necessity) by athletes and patients with high blood pressure.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s an accessory by definition it&rsquo;s more efficient for telling time than pulling out a phone.  Also my Seiko ran 10 years on one battery.  For telling time on the go, nothing beats a nice watch. Nothing.</p>
<p>Agreed.  Even better is that a mechanical watch will never run out of juice.  My mother told me that her mother&rsquo;s old watch wasn&rsquo;t touched for about twenty years, but when she took it out and wound it, it worked perfectly again.  Getting something that looks nice, is built well, lasts for ages and is convenient will always trump a phone for people who have enough commitments to need to know the time frequently.</p>
<p>But an iWatch is <span class="caps">NOT</span> simply a time-telling device. They&rsquo;re targeting people who want to be able to use their phone while it&rsquo;s in their pocket. Not people who already have expensive watches.</p>
<p>could use the watch to tell time..</p>
<p>o really? i would pay any amount of money to check time on a curved glass.</p>
<p>thats the core concept of a watch.</p>
<p>not of a smart watch</p>
<p>I think something like this would be more interesting as a necklace. It would be wearable but wouldn&rsquo;t be strange to hold up to your ear if needed. Imagine your smartphone worn like a backstage pass.</p>
<p>how do you watch a screen on your necklace though, they&rsquo;re talking about curved glass, a screen yeah</p>
<p>Nobody wants apple products anymore.</p>
<p>Said the people who buy millions of Apple products every year-including those people who bought 5 million iPhone 5&#8217;s within 72 hours of its launch.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the reality distortion field in action.</p>
<p>Your name is very fitting.</p>
<p>The only reality distortion is blind hatred. Remove your sunglasses of hate and you will see the truth.</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s your <strong>anti</strong>-reality distortion field.</p>
<p>To claim apple is &ldquo;no longer making products people want&rdquo; is straight-up delusional. Period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in reality-land, Apple&rsquo;s last quarter was the fourth most profitable in human history, behind only oil giants.</p>
<p>I doubt that. Is that inflation adjusted? Are you genuinely telling me Apple made more profit than the British East India company which owned India for a hundred years? Are you telling me it made more than standard oil when it was worth 2% of Americas entire <span class="caps">GDP</span>? Are you really telling me that? Human history lol.</p>
<p>fanboys don&rsquo;t care really care about that, didn&rsquo;t you know?</p>
<p>have to lol @ &ldquo;fanboys&rdquo;, as if it really makes a difference either way in regards to the original point&hellip; People are still buying Apple products, and there&rsquo;s no reason to believe they won&rsquo;t still be buying them for the near future.</p>
<p>Standard Oil, between 1882 to 1906 (a 24 year period), had net earnings of $838,783,800. Adjusted for inflation (1906 &rarr; 2012), that&rsquo;s about $21.5 billion. Apple&rsquo;s profits were nearly twice that &ndash; over $41 billion &ndash; last fiscal year <em>alone</em>.</p>
<p>are you sure about that homeslice? according to Dr.Google, Rockefeller was worth $700 billion in 2012 dollar terms.<br />
That&rsquo;s more than Apple <strong><em>alone</em></strong>.<br />
Now, if the apple fanboy above had merely stated Apple have had the 4th highest earnings report in the modern era, one could have let that stand. as it is, it just smacks of hyperbole and a breathless exaggeration.</p>
<p>Rockefeller&rsquo;s fortune was made more after the breakup of Standard Oil &ndash; when it was split, he gained proportionate shares in each company, and the companies&rsquo; combined net worths went up tremendously compared to Standard Oil alone.</p>
<p>You make good point. Without slavery, monopoly laws and colonialism, Apple can&rsquo;t possibly compete with human history.</p>
<p>no, it can&rsquo;t even compete with Exxon mobile, the company with the actual highest quarterly earnings report in the modern era.</p>
<p>Nobody wants Engadget fandroid trolls here anymore.</p>
<p>The irony.</p>

<p>Strange, it seems that most people I know want Apple products.</p>
<p>You would hold it up the way someone might use a stopwatch that&rsquo;s worn around the neck.</p>
<p>I think this reply was meant for me. I see your point now Sibelius.</p>
<p>Put a Facetime camera on it.</p>
<p>and they shall call it <strong>iPhone Nano</strong>.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a phone so no. Try again.</p>
<p>so the tooth fairy told you that? why couldn&rsquo;t it have a radio?</p>
<p>Then put a Nest sensor in it so the temperature can adjust exactly to what my body is feeling.</p>
<p>Curved glass.. on a watch. Wow that&rsquo;s amazing..</p>
<p>What would be amazing is if Apple could get a whole generation of consumers that grew up without need for watches to embrace a new product/market like this. I don&rsquo;t suppose they could pull it off since they&rsquo;ve never done anything similar. iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad, retail stores. Oh, I almost forgot the computers that started it all too&hellip;Apple 1, 2 and Macintosh.</p>
<p>Apple can&rsquo;t even make a good phone. why do they need a watch? weird?</p>

<p>What the hell does that even have to do with the iPhone being a bad phone? Just because people are stupid enough to buy one, does not mean that it is a good phone. This only shows that people using iPhones are more likely to part with their money. How did that old saying go again? Oh, yeah: &ldquo;A fool and His money are soon parted&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I am submitting your comment to Webster for the new definition of &ldquo;denial&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Well, what we have here is a difference of definitions. Here is why. To you, a good smartphone means:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must have malware</li>
	<li>its library of software titles must be of the lowest inferior quality</li>
	<li>it must be over-complicated to use</li>
	<li>it must have less apps than the leader</li>
	<li>it must lack a serious music/movie/book store</li>
	<li>device resale value must be bottom of the barrel</li>
	<li>device quality must be as cheaply made as possible</li>
	<li>it must never be rated #1 in customer satisfaction</li>
	<li>it must lose official update support just after a few months of ownership</li>
	<li>it must have severely inferior web browsing experience and web browsing share</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. <span class="caps">THAT</span> is your definition of a good smartphone. The iPhone is neither of the things I just listed, therefore to you, the iPhone fits squarely in your own personal definition of a bad smartphone. Fortunately, the rest of the word goes by the normal definition of good, which is the first list I posted above. And the iPhone achieves that with flying colors.</p>
<p>Another thing. You were incapable of responding with any facts that counter my list of iPhone achievements. And you simply resorted to name calling and laughably attempting to pass your opinion as fact. All that remains to be said for your comments is: <span class="caps">LOL</span>!!!</p>
<p>I want this yesterday. (Because yesterday, my watch broke.)</p>
<p>Well, maybe Apple might be able to use its exclusive license of Liquidmetal for these watches.<br /><a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/04/looking-into-one-of-apples-special-purpose-liquidmetal-projects.html">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/04/looking-into-one-of-apples-special-purpose-liquidmetal-projects.html</a></p>
<p>The thing I like about smartphones is that I can put it away once in a while. I don&#8217;t even wear accessories or watches since I hate things clinging onto my body. I like using tech as a tool and not as a centrepoint in my life.</p>
<p>good thing they&rsquo;re repealing the watch law so you&rsquo;re no longer forced to wear it.</p>
<p>Seems very conveniently timed with the recent post from Tognazzini. I call bullshit on their source.</p>
<p>Lookout Pebble!  Apple is about to invent the smartwatch.</p>
<p>You think Pebble invented the smartwatch? Oh that&rsquo;s grand.</p>
<p>Way to miss the point.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t the point of your post to make some idiot response about how much you hate Apple? I can assure you we felt the full effect of it.</p>
<p>Welcome to the new Engadget.</p>
<p>No, that wasn&rsquo;t the point of my post.  I have the feeling that you&rsquo;re quite accustomed to being wrong.</p>
<p>Please do enlighten me. What was your point?</p>
<p>I think their point was that no one ever singly invented any gadget in the 21at century. Name something that EngDget covers and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;inventor&rdquo; and I&rsquo;ll step back to show you who they ripped it off from.</p>
<p>Apple has a demonstrated history of filing for and being awarded patents where prior art exists.  If they have a successful product that implements said patents, they&rsquo;ve shown a willingness to harm competitors through litigation.</p>
<p>This is not controversial or made up, it&rsquo;s simple fact.</p>
<p>As has pretty much every big tech company.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t excuse Apple&rsquo;s bad behavior.  It&rsquo;s anti-consumer, anti-competition, and restricts innovation.  And in the specific case of Pebble (bringing it back around to my original post), that bad behavior has the potential to literally put them out of business.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ll repeat.  &ldquo;Lookout Pebble! Apple is about to invent the smartwatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If anything Pebble just copied and evolved what had been done with the iPod Nano and other watches. &ldquo;Watch out Apple! Pebble just invented the smartwatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow.  You&rsquo;re still not getting it.  This..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out Apple! Pebble just invented the smartwatch.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>..doesn&rsquo;t make any sense because Pebble is in no position to litigate Apple out of existence.</p>
<p>Just admit you&rsquo;re an Apple hater who holds them to a whole different standard than any other tech company. Isn&rsquo;t hating on Apple getting kinda old? Must still be fun since every new Apple and even non-Apple news stories are filled with haters.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll buy up all of Pebbles work, absorb them into the Apple machine and march onward!</p>
<p>Just like Google?</p>
<p>Is this the big surprise?  Somehow I think selling appl right now is a good idea!!</p>
<p>Apple are killing themselves slowly.. The Google Glass is a great idea, it&rsquo;s new and futuristic. A smart watch, isn&rsquo;t really a smart idea. Watches are for telling the time, not surfing the internet, we have smart phones that can easily fit into our pockets as it is to do that. And I&rsquo;m not saying this as a fan of Google. Had Apple invented the iGlass and Google had come up with a Nexus Watch or something, I&rsquo;d be all for Apple on this one.</p>
<p>Think of it as an accessory rather than a replacement for smart phones. Now think of that accessory partnering with your phone, tablet, PC, TV, car, home automation and more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watches are for telling the time, not surfing the internet</p>

<p>Circa 2001:</p>

<p>Phones are for making calls, not surfing the internet</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Google Glass is a great idea, it&rsquo;s new and futuristic. A smart watch, isn&rsquo;t really a smart idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Glass is actually a terrible idea.</p>
<p>If people thought that bluetooth headsets were cumbersome and dorky-looking, wait until they see Google Glass.  (Oh, and just wait until legislatures decide that having an internet-enabled video screen in your peripheral vision creates a dangerous distraction while driving, and makes wearing them while driving illegal.)</p>
<p>Smart watches, <span class="caps">OTOH</span>, take an accessory that everyone is already familiar with and comfortable using, and add functionality.  Add a cool Nexus 4-like magnetic wireless charging dock for your bedside table, and the battery issue is completely resolved.  Its really a no-brainer.</p>
<p>So cater to current market instead of creating new markets for the future? That won&rsquo;t let you keep the lead, and it is also why apple aren&rsquo;t doing that well on the stock market lately.</p>
<p>Apple has been working with wearable computing and Augmented Reality glasses for a long while now. <br /><a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/12/the-next-step-in-apples-glass-project-revealed.html">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/12/the-next-step-in-apples-glass-project-revealed.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/11/will-apple-lead-or-follow-in-the-future-glass-projects-market.html">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/11/will-apple-lead-or-follow-in-the-future-glass-projects-market.html</a><br /><a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/07/apple-working-on-advanced-display-for-future-video-glasses.html">http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2012/07/apple-working-on-advanced-display-for-future-video-glasses.html</a></p>
<p>The thing is Apple is usually very quiet about everything until they release the final product. Microsoft has also been working on this.</p>

Remember, every company can bring their own glasses technology because Apple&rsquo;s patent is specific for its own idea and implementation and Google&rsquo;s glasses use a different implementation.</p>

<p>Here is the problem they might have been working on it, but the way apple is being run right now we will never see a consumer product of it, since apple only are focusing on the current market. Of course they have an R&amp;D department, but it is in a state close to that of what xerox was. They are running a business model build on incremental changes, so even if they somehow manage to build a product that could create a new market, like they did with the iPhone and iPad, we will not see it, since it would be something radical. If what I&rsquo;m saying turn out to be wrong sometime in the future, than apple stock will start rising again.</p>
<p>You do realize something right? iPad was released in 2010. iPhone released in 2007. iPod was released all the way back in 2001. iMac in 1998. Look at the year gaps in Apples &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; product releases, the minimum is 3.</p>
<p>You know what they did in between those years? Incremental updates to all their current models.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t see something big from Apple this year you may be right. But I highly doubt that we won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>That has all been under the supervision while Steve Job was the <span class="caps">CEO</span>, do you remember the time period where he wasn&rsquo;t there? Also all of those product are build on previously products, like the iPhone using itunes, because people was used to doing it with the iPod.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m building my case on history of apple and what the stock market are saying.<br /><img title="" src="http://i.minus.com/ikU83ebTuOqfc.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Even if they are generating more profit than they ever have, the stock market simply don&rsquo;t belive apple have a future anymore</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get this &ldquo;Steve Jobs worship&rdquo; from Apple detractors.  Does anybody think that Steve Jobs&rsquo; influence on Apple was seriously limited to his physical presence?  He was gone for over a year battling cancer and they did just fine.  Steve Jobs completely changed the way Apple works.  Jobs&rsquo; greatest creation was not the iPhone or iPad or the Mac or the iPod&hellip;. it was Apple.  He formed the company in his vision of how it should be run.  He was hardly the only innovator and hardly did the majority of the innovation.  He brought people together to do that innovation and created a culture for them to do it in.  He even setup education courses in Apple&rsquo;s internal training university to teach his method for competing and identifying where the puck was going to be and all of his executive team and management were required to receive that training (some directly from Jobs himself).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like Jobs could have been in a hundred places at once.  Apple&rsquo;s engineering and design staff deserve so much more credit than they are given.  The #1 thing Steve did was get poor management out of the way of innovative minds.  I have yet to see the return of poor management at Apple &mdash; in fact we just saw Cook remove Forstall which is just another example of removing poor management to make way for innovation.</p>
<p>Citing the stock market as proof of your opinion only causes your position to lose credibility.  If anything, Wall Street has the worst track record for predicting the &ldquo;future&rdquo; of any market.  Five years ago the stock market was riding <span class="caps">RIM</span> and Dell as the future of tech.  How&rsquo;d that work out?  Wall Street does not look any further than next quarter&rsquo;s results and sometimes no further than the daily highs and lows to make money both ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Citing the stock market as proof of your opinion only causes your position to lose</p>

<p><strong>sigh</strong> Not once did I state this is my opinion, heck I even state the opposite<br />
bq. this isn&rsquo;t my opinion, this is what the stock market are telling us.</p>
<p>My opinion is different from my comment, but fanboys always sees red if someone point out something negative with what they love.</p>
<p>Oh and I&rsquo;m well aware that Steve Jobs isn&rsquo;t an inventor, what he changed was the management, and making the right decisions.</p>
<p>This is something from my opinion and build on analyzing data:</p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m disappointed in apple that they haven&rsquo;t been doing radical changes when it comes to their software, they have pretty much always just expanded or build upon their own success, without taking big changes, all of their products have done that a lot since the ipod, because of its success. This is all very well, but the design is starting to show its limitation, because it is build on a tangible design philosophy, which is amazing on the short run, but in the long run you will be limited by its constrain of what you can show. Their hardware has unfortunately have been moved toward design a way from human, and more toward being something ascetic pleasing, they don&rsquo;t seem to care about rules like &ldquo;your forever&rdquo;, and other thing designer should care about, when they have so much influence. That is not to say other companies don&rsquo;t have problems, because they really do, however apple how been putting a lot more focus on strengthening their brand, than actually making product for humans. You might think that then people wouldn&rsquo;t buy apple products, but that would only be true if, 1 other companies cared about good feedback 2 if apple wasn&rsquo;t so good at using &ldquo;lock in&rdquo; 3 and if people actually cared about good products more than their brand value, which just isn&rsquo;t gonna happen.</em></p>
<p>edit: dammit wanted to see preview not post, but I guess that cover enough to show what my opinion is, just without any conclusion :-/</p>
<p>I think Apple&rsquo;s strategy has always been&hellip;.</p>
<p>1) Release a break-through product</p>
<p>2) Iterate on that product for a few years until it matures</p>
<p>3) Change the game by releasing another breakthrough product that integrates seamlessly with the previous product.</p>
<p>4) Go back to step 2.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;re next breakthrough is due in this year or next year according to track record.  Certainly iPad is far more usable than other tablets based on available touch-optimized software.  But people don&rsquo;t need the same kind of productivity on their smartphones (apps don&rsquo;t matter as much) and there are plenty of Android phones that are a solid substitute for an iPhone.  Of course those other Android phones don&rsquo;t integrate as well with iPad or Mac, but selling a single product versus a suite of products is a long-term play.</p>
<p>We should expect something new from Apple in 2013 or 2014.  That may be a major improvement to iPhone, a new kind of smart watch, something like Google Glass or a new way to enjoy television.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the &ldquo;Apple stopped innovating&rdquo; meme simple because competitors are starting to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; to Apple.  If you ask me, the competitors are not really innovating either <strong>if you hold them to the same standard</strong>.  Everybody has been overhauling and then iterating since iPhone&rsquo;s and iPad&rsquo;s introductions.  Certainly the most ground has been made up in the smartphone space since Android 4.0 came out and Windows Phone 7 launched.  There is much more ground for competitors to make up for in the tablet space.  But still, the competition is not changing the game or &ldquo;innovating&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cool market-changing ground-breaking innovations in the last decade or so (not prototypes and not iterative refinements):</p>
<p>1999: MapQuest<br />
2003: iPod<br />
2006: Wii<br />
2007: iPhone<br />
2008: Netflix Video Streaming<br />
2010: iPad<br />
2010: Kinect</p>
<p>Apple, Microsoft, Nintendo and Netflix all make that list.  I don&rsquo;t even see Google on that list because Google&rsquo;s best stuff comes from taking something somebody else has done and simply redoing it, giving it a wider audience and refining it.  Google made a better search engine than Yahoo or Alta Vista.  Google Maps is way better than MapQuest, but did it represent ground-breaking innovation or simply cloning a competitor and making a better version of it?  Google Docs is cool, but nothing about has changed the world &mdash; Microsoft Office is still the de facto &ldquo;office&rdquo; suite.  Android is cool, but again, it is Google&rsquo;s version of iPhone OS (now iOS).</p>
<p>Am I saying that nobody else has done cool stuff?  No.  Just nothing else that is of the &ldquo;ground-breakingly innovative&rdquo; level that folks are demanding of Apple.  There are tons of other cool innovative features, products, and technologies out there:</p>
<p>- Bluetooth<br />
- WiFi 802.11b, g, n, ac<br />
- <span class="caps">LTE</span><br />
- <span class="caps">NFC</span><br />
- FaceTime<br />
- Siri<br />
- Google Docs<br />
- Google Now<br />
- iCloud<br />
- WebOS MultiTasking interface<br />
- Metro User Interface<br />
- Cloud computing / device synchronization<br />
- <span class="caps">GPS</span> Navigation</p>
<p>None of these constitute an industry-changing product from a single vendor like what is being demanded of Apple to prove that they are innovative.  They are either widely-used technologies that are not attributable to a single vendor or features that come from a single vendor that make their products cooler, but not game-changing.  Every product or service in my first list transformed an industry.  The named product or service may not have been the ultimate market winner, but it represents the innovative step and divergence from the past.</p>
<p>If I knew who invented &ldquo;Turn-by-Turn <span class="caps">GPS</span> Navigation&rdquo; then I would add the first product to that list above since it was certainly transformative.  I am guessing that much of the software was written more than 15 years ago, but simply came to consumers after the military had it &mdash; but I could not find a source.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t seem to understand what innovation is? I don&rsquo;t mean that in a negative way, since it is a very difficult word to understand, because it carry so much meaning</p>
<p>Definition of innovation <br /><em>&ldquo;An innovation is more than an invention. It advances a novel idea to <br />
the next level, reducing it to practice in a way that creates economic <br />
valuefor some group of customers. An innovation may lower the <br />
cost of producing what a company already produces, enhance the <br />
values of the company&rsquo;s output, or allow the company to reach new <br />
customers. It may either enhanceor replace existing products and it <br />
may do so by altering a product, a set of processes, or both.&rdquo;</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The introduction of a new good &mdash; that is one with which consumers are not yet <br />
familiar &ndash; or of a new quality of a good.</li>
	<li>The introduction of a new method of production, which need by no means be <br />
founded upon a discovery scientifically new, and can also exist in a new way of <br />
handling a commodity commercially.</li>
	<li>The opening of a new market that is a market into which the particular branch of <br />
manufacture of the country in question has not previously entered, whether or <br />
not this market has existed before.</li>
	<li>The conquest of a new source of supply of raw materials or half-manufactured <br />
goods, again irrespective of whether this source already exists or whether it has <br />
first to be created.</li>
	<li>The carrying out of the new organization of any industry, like the creation of a <br />
monopoly position or the breaking up of a monopoly position &ldquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>I would highly recommend you to read &ldquo;Designing Interactions by Bill Moggridge&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s best stuff comes from taking something somebody else has done and simply redoing it giving it a wider audience and refining it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can see you doesn&rsquo;t quite understand the difference between innovation and an invention. I would recommend looking more into what an innovation actually is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google made a better search engine than Yahoo or Alta Vista.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite they changed the way you searched, and the way you received adds. Their business model/canvas was very different from anything seen at that moment. If all they had done was just doing incremental changes to the search engine it wouldn&rsquo;t have yield so high increase in market share. I would again make a recommendation, this time it would be to actually study what made Google successful with their search engine.</p>
<p>You seem to value hardware innovation higher than the rest of what it mean to make innovation, and doesn&rsquo;t consider such things as &ldquo;atomic e-business model&rdquo; innovative. I mean this in a very non negative when I say this, but I take it you are self learned on these kind of subjects, and haven&rsquo;t actually had any education about innovation, design or economy?</p>
<p>We are also suffering by having syntactic, semantic and possible pragmatics boundaries, in the future I will restrain myself from commenting when all three of these are there, since the time to get pass them take to much time, to be worth its time. I also apologize if I didn&rsquo;t make it clear to you what I was saying, but I&rsquo;m a very practical man, so I can&rsquo;t always get the message pass the boundaries, there often is when communicating on the internet trough text.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If what I&rsquo;m saying turn out to be wrong sometime in the future</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then none of us will be remotely surprised that some guy on the internet who predicted Apple is doomed, like every other bozo analyst for the last decade was wrong.</p>
<p>fanboy get of your high heel, and learn about business and how the value of one company is establish <br />
I&rsquo;m building my case on history of apple and what the stock market are saying, this isn&rsquo;t my opinion, this is what the stock market are telling us. <br /><img title="" src="http://i.minus.com/ikU83ebTuOqfc.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Even if they are generating more profit than they ever have, the stock market simply don&rsquo;t believe apple have a future in the long run anymore, it isn&rsquo;t just one analyst it is all of them.</p>
<p>Since you are repeating yourself, I will repeat myself:</p>
<p>Citing the stock market as proof of your opinion only causes your position to lose credibility. If anything, Wall Street has the worst track record for predicting the &ldquo;future&rdquo; of any market. Five years ago the stock market was riding <span class="caps">RIM</span> and Dell as the future of tech. How&rsquo;d that work out? Wall Street does not look any further than next quarter&rsquo;s results and sometimes no further than the daily highs and lows to make money both ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but the way apple is being run right now<br />

<p>Clearly you have no clue what you&rsquo;re talking about. With 100% certainty, you do not know how Apple is actually being run, and you certainly have zero clue about what is causing Apple&rsquo;s stock price decline. All that you&rsquo;re doing is poorly attempting to pass fact-less, self-fabricated opinion as fact.</p>
<p>oh fanboy you so funny :D</p>
<p>Or mindless troll&hellip; so funny.</p>
<p>I would rather troll than trying to have a discussion with a fanboy in a comment section, he was so hateful towards me, that it was pointless to even attempting to make a real respond to his comment.</p>
<p>Understood&hellip; but when &ldquo;fanboy&rdquo; came out in two successive comments it was just a bit hard to stomach.</p>
<p>They are both fan boys, also why I didn&rsquo;t bother creating a new response for the second first one, since I don&rsquo;t care about being right, I care about people understanding that their view isn&rsquo;t necessary the right one. What I comment quite often have nothing to do with what I think, and its sole purpose is hopefully to make people see they are only stating an opinion, and it isn&rsquo;t enough to only look at pros you also have to look at the cons. If they only intent to look at pros for what they like, I simply won&rsquo;t waste time with a response. It is also a bit of a paradox, if I actually use time on a response that will prove someone completely wrong, people will simply ignore it</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very odd that you claim to know something, yet you stay completely mute about Apple closing 4Q2012 which was:</p>
<ul>
<li>The most profitable quarter in Apple&rsquo;s history</li>
	<li>The most profitable in the history of any electronics company</li>
	<li>Regained its title as most valued company in the world (beat out Exxon)</li>
	<li>Sold a record number of iPads</li>
	<li>Sold a record number of iPhones</li>
	<li>84% of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s smartphone sales were iPhones</li>
	<li>55% of Verizon&rsquo;s smartphone sales were iPhones</li>
	<li>Sprint sold a record 6.6 million iPhones in the holiday quarter</li>
	<li>The majority of new iPhone buyers are former Android users</li>
	<li>Apple&rsquo;s inventory is 5 to 6 days = every product shipped = every product sold</li>
	<li>Demand for Apple products is greater than supply</li>

<p>Im going to go ahead and take a screenshot of your comment. Then after the Google goggles have failed I can come back, show you your own comment and then we can all point and laugh.</p>
<p>Wow, what a troll</p>
<p>According to you, anyone who dares to state facts is a troll.</p>
<p>bq.The Google Glass is a great idea, it&rsquo;s new and futuristic</p>
<p>Yeah, Google Glass is a great idea but it&rsquo;s not new, others have the same idea, and being Google it will be slanted towards advertising. It won&rsquo;t show you want you want to see, it will show you what Google&rsquo;s advertisers want you to see. Sometimes they are the same thing and sometimes there wont be anything the advertiser wants you to see but the ads are why they will exist, not the service.</p>
<p>Oh they definitely are. Apple wouldn&#8217;t have changed the Nano back to an iPod form factor for no reason. They clearly saw the potential of it as a watch with the clock faces and wrist bands you could buy in Apple stores.</p>
<p>too slow.</p>
<p>" Sources familiar with the company&rsquo;s plans". That&rsquo;s BS.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AKA</span> let&rsquo;s just throw this article out there to keep <span class="caps">AAPL</span> from plummeting.</p>
<p>Could it be that this watch is actually their new TV? (See Things to Come" from 1935)</p>
<p>As far as connected devices go, I would much rather get a watch than glasses. I&rsquo;m not going to speculate on the future of google glass, but if I found out my friend was checking email while pretending to listen to me I&rsquo;d punch him in the face.</p>
<p>1) You have to go through 3 menus to get to the current time but the first 12 characters of each iOS notification show up with just a wave of a stylus to your wrist.<br />
2) Great reception of the Disney Channel and XD on your wrist. All you get from <span class="caps">ABC</span> is reruns of The Last Resort. <span class="caps">ESPN</span> is blacked out unless you have an optional up-sell with your cable operator.<br />
3) It ticks. That&rsquo;s the acousti-skeuomorphic design interface. As an added feature, it increases volume in the presence of <span class="caps">TSA</span> agents.</p>
<p>Is this seriously the level of discourse on this website now?</p>
<p>Unfortunately yes. The anti Apple trolls are here in force lately.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s just as bad the other way round in Android related articles.</p>
<p>Is it?  I&rsquo;d like to see someone do an actual comparison.  I do know that any article with the word &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; in it seems far more likely to have larger total number of comments.</p>
<p>Honestly all of these are nothing in comparison to Engadget where shit would just hit the fan in every single article.</p>
<p>queue aapl boys; innovation and the first.</p>
<p>ios needs a major overhaul in design.  if they plan to use these little silly 90-esque icons then it&rsquo;d look like shit.  it needs fluidity and metroesque.</p>
<p>This would be exactly what I&rsquo;ve wanted. I am interested in the idea of a smartwatch, but the current options are ugly and poorly designed. I think people need to get past the point that a smartwatch must look like a classic watch. I want something similar to the fuel band but with a curved glass display, showing alerts for messages, updates, etc. This should look modern rather than trying to make it look like a dead accessory. I&rsquo;ve been hoping Apple or Google were headed in this direction -</p>

<p>Hey&mdash;- just what the world needs more breakable products made out of glass from Apple. How much did they make replacing all those shattered iPhone panels anyway?</p>
<p>Fortunes. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that when the iPhone 5 went aluminium the stock price tanked. <br />
This is clearly the band-aid to get some of that lovely replacement glass margin back into play. <br />
Good shout dude.</p>
<p>Hard to tell if you are egregiously trolling, or if you actually believe what you just said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to hate myself when I buy it :(.  Just like the iPad I&#8217;m going to think its the most ridiculous concept ever until I&#8217;m at the store messing around with one and the next thing I know I&#8217;m buying it.</p>
<p>You bring up an interesting point there in a roundabout way. A watch that is designed to pair with other iDevices sounds tricky to demo via Apple retail stores.</p>
<p>have the geniuses wear them.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;d buy it on launch if they ship with <span class="caps">PTT</span> tech in them.</p>

<p>Glad to see more companies heading in this direction. I hope Google also does a watch. There was a really boss &lsquo;Google Time&rsquo; concept someone did not long ago, and it looked amazing. It has a Google Now/Holo 2.0 look to it.</p>

<p>This needs more Recommend&rsquo;ing!!!</p>
<p>Why would anyone want to press that Google+ icon?</p>
<p>This has a screaming dork factor that is unusual and unbecoming of Apple. Watches are mainly fashion accessories nowadays, since people can use phones to check the time, along with emails and texts.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m wearing a watch, it&rsquo;s primarily for a look&hellip; something classy. I&rsquo;m not trading Armani or Rolex for iOS; sorry.</p>
<p>of course. smartphones and tablets are not geeky at all.</p>
<p>a smartphone is like testosterone. it&rsquo;s gorilla glass encased pheromones for chicks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this is designed to replace Rolexes. Its designed to be cross-sold to apple consumers.</p>
<p>I still chuckle every time I see that ubiquitous &#8220;sources familiar with the company&#8221; term.</p>
<p>There should be a law against quoting any Apple related story with the words &ldquo;Sources familiar with the company&rdquo; in it. That is a sure way to know the story is going to be BS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a coin toss.</p>
<p>There have been quite a few accurate <span class="caps">WSJ</span> stories coming from sources attributed like that, don&rsquo;t write it off too quickly.</p>
<p>will it ship with the New Years alarm bug?</p>
<p>Glass around my tender girly wrist? No thanks.</p>
<p>Apple, you don&rsquo;t need to make anything anymore.</p>
<p>If it embitters and enrages you watching Apple continuing succeeding, then you&rsquo;re on an ever-decreasing minority.</p>
<p>Ehhhhh, just seems like a a stretch.</p>
<p>No way I give up my Seiko <span class="caps">SKX</span>-007 for this.  Too many people who this would be marketed to are already used to wearing a decent watch.</p>
<p>Trade your Seiko for&hellip; what?</p>
<p>You think you already saw Apple&rsquo;s smart-watch, and you already tried it and tested it and then concluded it&rsquo;s not worth trading your Seiko KX-007? Please share with us. Because at this point this is just a rumor and no fact.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct.  Whatever Apple comes up with is not going to compare favorably to the nice (although inexpensive!) mechanical watch I already wear.  This isn&rsquo;t tablets or iPods or iPhones, smart-watches will have to compete with already occupied real-estate, and as I said, many of their target consumers already have something sitting there.</p>
<p>highest.ranked has a point. You don&rsquo;t have any knowledge of how the device will look or function, so saying that it isn&rsquo;t better than your current watch is a bit foolish. It might not even end up being a watch-replacement, but something else you wear on your wrist.</p>
<p>Right.  And my wrist is currently occupied with a piece of what is essentially jewelry.  It&rsquo;s taken.  There&rsquo;s no room there.  Which is why I don&rsquo;t think Apple is actually working on a watch replacement.  Apple tends to look for areas where there is either a gap or a perceived gap, and then fills that gap.  There&rsquo;s no gap here, so I don&rsquo;t envision Apple trying to fill it.</p>

<p>The day an iWatch or any other smartwatch replaces my Omega Seamaster will be a long way off.</p>
<p>I am more of a traditionalist when it comes to watches.</p>
<p><img title="undefined" src="http://www.apetogentleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/OMEGA-SEAMASTER-PLANET-OCEA.jpg" alt="undefined" /></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re alone in thinking that. This is why I can&rsquo;t see the iWatch being anything more than the official Apple version of an accessory, with the aim to have tonnes of third-party support. Imagine if the Omega Seamaster could offer iWatch functionality?</p>
<p>Also, I hope and pray the iWatch looks more like that than any of the square, plastic, utilitarian concepts knocking around the internet. When Josh commented on the iPhone 5&rsquo;s chamfered edges feeling like &ldquo;jewellery&rdquo;, it did make me think of how a similar design language could be used to nice effect on the iWatch.</p>
<p>Interesting to see where apple will be in 18 months&hellip;where&rsquo;s their next big thing&hellip;ipod, iphone, ipad&hellip;.iwatch?</p>
<p>Are they trying for the next game changer with this&hellip;i&rsquo;m not convinced.</p>
<p>oh.. there u go .. one more i-no-Brainer</p>
<p>Why is this a story? Aside from being click bait. Apple is always experimenting with things. Most of which never make it out of the lab.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see your point.  Every day there is a supply chain rumor on someone&rsquo;s products.  This is one of those.<br /><span class="caps">NEWS</span> <span class="caps">FLASH</span>: Yes, they discuss rumors on The Verge.</p>
<p>Combine this with an accelerometer, make it discrete like the Nike Fuelband and I&rsquo;ll preorder it. I love my fuelband and the only way it&rsquo;d be better is a heartrate monitor and better access to my phone functions.</p>
<p>If this comes with a <span class="caps">GPS</span>, looks good, has reasonable battery life and around $150, I&rsquo;d consider buying it. Bonus marks if it includes Nike&rsquo;s fuel system and heart rate monitor.</p>
<p>Reinventing Garmin.</p>
<p>I hope this watch comes to fruition in the very near future. Here&rsquo;s a scenario I&rsquo;m imagining:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting on my couch with some family members. We just got back from a long day in the park. My iPhone 5 is low on battery, so it&rsquo;s charging on a side table. Eager to see the videos and photos from the day&rsquo;s activities, I use my iWatch as a bridge to send the media from my iPhone to our AppleTV.</p>
<p>What would you want it to be able to do?</p>
<p>Too many pieces, too complex and too costly when you can solve all the issues including battery life with Galaxy Note II.</p>
<p>if Korhoden has an AppleTV and an iPhone 5 then he can already AirPlay his photos into the TV right away. Galaxy Note II is absurdly useless for any useful and enjoyable functions like that.</p>
<p>Ever heard of <span class="caps">DLNA</span>?</p>
<p>Toss3, shhhh, we don&rsquo;t speak of facts here.</p>
<p>Ever tried to use <span class="caps">DLNA</span>?</p>
<p>Sure have. Did you know that no one uses it?</p>
<p>if you have AppleTV and an iPhone 5, just do AirPlay to cast all your pictures on your TV as the phone is charging.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably buy an apple watch even if all it did was tell time.</p>
<p>What depresses me is the potential that this is a world class device, locked up in a closed eco-system.</p>
<p>Depressed? Why? Were you intending to use an &lsquo;open&rsquo; ecosystem to develop life-saving apps, but now you can&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Goddamn the whining has already begun and it&rsquo;s always &lsquo;first world problems&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s terrible the way nobody can do anything on iOS or <span class="caps">OSX</span> devices, because of how locked down they are&hellip;</p>
<p>What should depress you even more is that, that <em>other</em> platform that parades being &ldquo;open&rdquo; has severely worse app quality, and drastically less apps. Even apps that have parity with iOS apps actually have missing features in the non-Apple versions.</p>
<p>Also, paid apps and more expensive in that <em>other</em> platform and are cheaper in iOS. Oh and free apps on <em>that</em> non-iOS platform consumer 50% more battery power than paid apps because they run two processes (one for the app, one for ads). So either way it is still worse.</p>
<p>Adding insult to injury, that <em>other</em> platform touting being &ldquo;open&rdquo; is soooooooo open, that as of December 2012, that platform accumulated 120,000+ malware, while iOS has zero malware!</p>
<p>Now, those are <strong>real</strong> reasons to be depressed about.</p>
<p>Where did you get that 50% from? You do know that there are hundreds of different android phones out there, so that cannot possibly hold true for each and every one of them. In fact, I don&rsquo;t think it holds true for any of them.</p>
<p>Huh, last time I checked android had both more free apps and cheaper apps(since 2011).</p>
<p>Quoting the amount of malware is just ridiculous, as it does not affect 99.9999999% of Android users.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Verge reported the battery usage problem. What university research data do you have to disprove Purdue&rsquo;s findings?<br /><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/19/2884902/android-apps-battery-efficiency-study">Purdue University research: Android Pay for free apps with battery life</a>

<p>Yes, because one puny little process relates to a complete 50% more battery consumption. You obviously have no idea how Android&rsquo;s adservice works, so why don&rsquo;t you just stop spreading misinformation?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That malware is from sideloading apps. Which is opt-in. Therefore, not only is it incomparable to iOS, which is utterly incapable of side-loading apps, it is also a non-concern for the vast, vast majority of Android users. The chances of getting malware from a non-sideloaded app from a non-dodgy-looking porn site would be &lt;0.01%.</p>
<p>Plenty of malware has been distributed through Play. The ineffective screening process and wide distribution makes it a big (easy) target.</p>
<p>Well, the 50% more battery consumption is a research finding by the University of Purdue. I&rsquo;d love to see what other university research you have that disproves Purdue&rsquo;s findings. If you think you know how Android works then please explain.</p>
<p>When the results are corroborated by at least one other source, with an up-to-date phone running an up-to-date OS, then I&rsquo;ll believe it.</p>
<p>You could have all the major universities of the world showing you the same proof and you would still be in denial. Like you are now.</p>
<p>Do you actually think you know me better than I do? Such arrogance.</p>
<p>This can be amazing&hellip; A connected watch that is weather proof and control your Apple devices. #IWant</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t find this news all that exciting&hellip; after-all we already have pebble. Google glasses on the other hand are a smartphone accessory I&rsquo;m looking forward to!</p>
<p>So long as theyre affordable that is.</p>
<p>Yeah, Apple is probably going to end up making the Pebble watch with an Apple logo. Google Glasses, however, will be a riveting success like the Nexus Q.</p>
<p>Ipad nano rehashed?</p>
<p>Ug, no just no.</p>
<p>Yeah, let&rsquo;s &ldquo;re-invent&rdquo; the watch, patent the crap out of it with loose based patents on a <span class="caps">ROUNDED</span> square look and then sneak those through the already leaky boat known as the <span class="caps">USPTO</span>, then, oh man then, wait for iiiiiiiiiiiit&hellip;.</p>
<p>&hellip;Sue all the watch makers with our broad termed patents <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">TELLING</span> <span class="caps">TIME</span> apart from your smartphone.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll learn em all, man man man man man man man.</p>

<p>224 comments and 5 (five) mentions of word <em>curved</em>.</p>
<p>Apple iWatch is possible due to Samsung&rsquo;s curved display technology.</p>
<p>How do you know they&rsquo;re using Samsung. Corning already has made strong curved glass and there are many other companies making bendable oleds.</p>
<p>No one has demonstrated working samples of flexible display tech while Samsung did it in 2010 plus it&rsquo;s unbreakable even with a hammer so Corning not needed.</p>

<p>Your statement is as inane as saying that a Michellin-rated chef&rsquo;s quality of cooking is because of the pots he is using.</p>
<p>I wonder how Samsung, <span class="caps">HTC</span> (and on a wider scale, Microsoft), are going to respond to both Google Glass and this rumored watch from Apple. The Glass especially is hardware, unlike Android which was an open source software that everyone could tweak and use, unless Google decides to create the Glass as a reference design like Surface and have its partners create devices that derive from it. If Samsung decides to add TouchWiz on top of their version of Glass, will consumers like it ?</p>
<p>Right now, though, Microsoft is the only one without any device plans or rumors surrounding wearable devices. Blackberry caught up with 2008 only last week, so&hellip;:)</p>
<p>If Google can pull of Glass, they can charge a healthy premium and rake in money on hardware.  No need to farm out the work for it; that product will be unstoppable.</p>
<p>And they called me crazy.</p>
<p>Hmm, curved glass. Where have I seen that before?</p>
<p>Apple to sue the railway company that sued them earlier this year., Mondaine and every swiss watch maker.</p>
<p>Apple Patent #20202002: A device worn on wrist that tells time.</p>
<p>You just can&rsquo;t look at these two <a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17z058skj0icujpg/original.jpg">1</a> <a href="http://gadgetsin.com/uploads/2011/03/samsung_galaxy_player_4_and_5_1.jpg">2</a> phones and tell me Samsung didn&rsquo;t lift anything from it.  No two devices out there now are as similar as those, not even close.</p>
<p>How many times need to be said, that users, including me, was driven to buy an samsung phone not by singe apple&rsquo;s achievement (shape design and standard organizer UI) but by it&rsquo;s functionality, price, openness, great future for the product line etc. Galaxy has so many launchers to switch it and make non apple, so your point is outdated and stupid.</p>
<p><span class="caps">YOU</span> didn&rsquo;t, of course.  But how many phone buyers are like you, as a percentage of the whole?  It&rsquo;s not as many as you&rsquo;d think, especially when these things are selling 10&rsquo;s of <b>millions</b> of devices.  Samsung has spent a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of money in advertising, and they&rsquo;re done very well for themselves.  The only company aside from Apple making any money in the space.  Their current hardware doesn&rsquo;t, of course, but there&rsquo;s no way you can&rsquo;t honestly say the GS1 isn&rsquo;t a Samsung-ized 3GS from those photos.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Looks like it was just you. A large number of new iPhone buyers were former Android users.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=23672&cdvn=news&newsarticleid=35937">Apple&rsquo;s iPhone accounted for 84% of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s smartphone activations in Q4</a></p>
<p>As soon as someone figures out how to combine smartwatch functionality with a traditional analog aesthetic I&rsquo;m on board. Until then, I leave the future to others.</p>
<p>I just think the touchscreen would be a bit cramped&hellip;like the iPod nano 6th gen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX-gTobCJHs" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX-gTobCJHs</a></p>
<p>First thing that came to my head.</p>
<p>2008, when Nokia still mattered. How time flies.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t someone call this on the Vergecast discussion of the Pebble &ndash; all those Bluetooth APIs Apple had baked into iOS, discontinuing the perfect nano form factor&hellip;</p>
<p>Complete waste of time and for total posers only. It isn&rsquo;t going to be waterproof, it&rsquo;ll cost a fortune and it&rsquo;ll run out of charge just when you need it most. Will stick with my trusty self winding mechanical waterproof watch thank you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry, but i could not be less interested &hellip; <br />
P.S. I prefer <span class="caps">SEIKO</span> anyway &hellip;</p>
<p>plus, if you have a phone, which has the time on the display, why do you even need a watch, except as jewellery? <span class="caps">FAIL</span></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://torwars.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/shut-up-and-take-my-money.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>no. really don&rsquo;t take my money. shut up and give me <em>back</em> my money which I invested in Apple shares.</p>
<p>with how the stock market works, you are allowed to sale your shares at any time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my point genius. I am imagining a conversation with a stockbroker. Also, I am a stockbroker in real life.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine a day where I need a watch to tell me what is on my phone in my pocket but Apple may produce it and people will shell out their had earned money in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>I like the idea, but the current ones on the market just look horrible.</p>
<p>Watches are jewellery you idiots. <span class="caps">SELL</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bid is 16 1/2 and falling. As your broker I advise you to take it.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;<em>You</em> take it you fucking asshole cocksucker!&hellip; dump it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonder what Pebble thinks?</p>
<p>Neato, I&rsquo;ll totally buy one as long as it isn&rsquo;t ugly.</p>
<p>if not e-ink than its useless</p>
<p>I wonder if this will look less like a watch and more like a nike fuel band or more like a curved iPod Nano (the square one from a few generations ago) with a wrist band. Or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Poor Apple is late on that trend again. We are witnessing the downfall of an empire.<br /><img src="http://msnbcmedia3.msn.com/j/streams/2012/February/120220/56070-ToddBishopCC8778A7-049F-5474-2A3F-D865A1C27AC8.streams_desktop_medium.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>If guys start wearing the Apple smartwatches it will be a great way to tell which are men and which are boys, though.</p>
<p><img src="http://watchness24.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IWC-Pilots-Watch-Chrono-Automatic-Top-Gun-Steel.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Beastly watch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how Apple-haters get so enraged that will say and do anything to bash Apple. If the smart-watch was a Google watch these people would be singing it endless praises <span class="caps">AND</span> bashing Apple for not coming up with something similar. The hypocrisy is absurdly high with these people.</p>
<p>Are those internet time watches? I only keep time in beats. It&rsquo;s @919 now!</p>
<p>Michael Knight already has a watch with Siri on it. Has since the 80s.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0OHc1fFoJjU/T33L-zZ5nWI/AAAAAAAATtY/CtW-d2OL7qo/s1600/riverwired-c013anthonydevito53_barret_knight_rider181.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I imagine anyone wearing this would be considered douchey, unless your a 12 year old boy. That&rsquo;s if he survives a possible impact to the watch that could shatter and cut your veins. But whatever.</p>
<p>Geek Rage against Apple Ha&hellip;Ha&hellip;</p>
<p>Arguments.</p>
<p>Arguments everywhere.</p>
<p>Can anyone please explain me how can this app cost more than iPad?<br /><img title="" src="http://i50.tinypic.com/2zrghh2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Google Glass making up 3% of Google&rsquo;s revenue just blew my mind.  That&rsquo;s an insane number of people wearing those things in just 2 years.</p>
<p>I think that creating a watch for Apple could be the next logical step. As phones get bigger and more powerful, people will want something smaller and maybe less feature rich to give them quick tidbits of information. A watch is something that is glanced at, so creating &ldquo;applets&rdquo; for a watch that would give out this quick information would be helpful. Each complication could be an app. It makes a watch look classy and can be customizable.</p>
<p>This is why people use drugs.</p>
<p>I can hear Eric Schmidt cry: &#8220;THIS!&#8221;</p>
<p>Did you also hear Samsung scream: FUCK YES</p>
<p>And Apple is probably sending their goons to draw up patents for this.</p>
<p>Good to see QWERTY survived in the future.</p>
<p>Nooo!!!!! We need to switch to Dvorak!</p>
<p>No we don&#8217;t!</p>
<p>Totally agree with you about the Black Mirror parallels, both with regards to The Entire History of You and 15 Million Merits.</p>
<p>This is not a future we want.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about anybody else, but that video makes me SUPER excited for Google Glass. Yep.</p>
<p>Except that from the looks of it Google Glass can&#8217;t pull anything close to this besides video chat. But we still haven&#8217;t seen the finish product. Not giving Google the benefit of the doubt until I see it myself.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t even close to a finished product. They haven&#8217;t even put Glass into devs hands to start expanding on what the project could and will be. There&#8217;s no point of judging it at all. It&#8217;s a development tool right now, not a consumer product.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s only the first iteration. Imagine how much they can improve upon this</p>
<p>Face recognition and matching the person up to their FB &amp; Twitter profiles can&#8217;t be that difficult. I&#8217;m sure down the line Google glasses will have that feature. Also, why not an app that can listen to the tone of a person and make a best guess of their mood?</p>
<p>Sorry but I don&#8217;t think it can even do that, as in the &#8220;one day&#8221; video he&#8217; can see the full face of the woman. So, she must be using:<br />
a. a phone<br />
b.a tablet<br />
c. some other device with a webcam<br />
d. a stupid looking version of glasses with an antenna that brings the camera away far enough for it to be able to capture her face, while somehow making the glasses on her face invisible.</p>
<p>Taking pictures is the only thing that glasses is confirmed to be able to do, and I&#8217;m sorry but that just doesn&#8217;t justify the price. Ugh we&#8217;ll have to wait and see!</p>
<p>The price is for a device in development, not a consumer product.</p>
<p>meanwhile in reality</p>

<p>The quality of this short is amazing! They&#8217;ve done a great job!</p>
<p>Yeah definitely. Very impressive stuff. I started cracking up when she reacted to his achievements wall hahah. Took a really out of the blue and bizarre turn for the ending though.</p>
<p>Yeah, up to that point it was just augmented vision, but then it&#8217;s suddenly like they&#8217;re attached to the brain rather than just being contact lenses like it had appeared to be up till then.</p>
<p>I actually saw it coming, after the &#8220;mind control&#8221; comment/question. But very cool.</p>
<p>I saw it coming too. After she put up that &#8220;another bad date&#8221; status. That had nothing to do with her eyes. She &#8216;thought&#8217; that status.</p>
<p>back in high school, I read the book &#8220;Feed&#8221; by M.T. Anderson, it had a very similar premise, where everyone had an internet chip in the brain. the book was written before the advent of twitter and facebook, and even before text messaging really became popular (apparently 2002 might well have been the stone age), and its amazing to see just how simultaneously interconnected and detached we&#8217;ve become.</p>
<p>really looking forward to paul miller&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>Interesting. I read the same novel (Feed by Anderson) two weeks ago, and I couldn&#8217;t help but think about Project Glass when I was reading it.</p>
<p>Indeed. When it was written (and when I read it in &#8216;02) it seemed insane to be that interconnected. Now, with Glass and Twitter and Facebook, it&#8217;s a societal norm (though I refuse to call it normal)</p>
<p>This is not the future I want to live in.</p>
<p>Same here&#8230; But after watching this, I realized: thats exactly how its gonna be. People will not just do things the normal way&#8230; no, they will make a freakin fruit ninja game out of cutting a fruit&#8230; because thats so much cooler than lame reality.<br />
Everybody will sit at home doing virtual reality sports becauso you can hurt yourself while doing real sports and no insurance will pay your treatment when you tell the doctor you got hurt while climbing a mountain.<br />
Man I hope I dont live long enough to see this s*** happen.</p>
<p>Do you know any sci-fi movie where you want to live in? Not that many. Almost all sic-fi visions of the future are conservative. They always end with a denial of technology and a nostalgia for a less technological past. But that&#8217;s because sci-fi movies are not really about the future, but about the present. In real life, this never happens. We don&#8217;t wish we didn&#8217;t have smartphones, at least not more that a day or too.</p>
<p>Voice of reason. We were all supposed to have flying cars now, right?</p>
<p>Sry, but I just dont agree with you. I dont see any chance for a bright future&#8230; Why do you think this would never happen(Except the mind control thingy)?<br />
Many People are sitting at home in front of facebook, twitter etc. right now instead of going out doing something. What do you think would happen if we provide technology like this(and thats goingt to happen, think of google glass)?<br />
And btw: Probably I&#8217;m one of very few people out there, but I wouldn&#8217;t miss smartphones at all, that&#8217;s why I switched back to my nokia 6300 after my iPhone got damaged.</p>
<p>No, I think it could happen, but we won&#8217;t be averse to AR technology as this short pretends us to be. We&#8217;ll always fear technology will dehumanise us, and probably does, but in any case we&#8217;ll simply don&#8217;t care. We don&#8217;t care now, and we already live surrounded by gadgets, wi-fi and ice-cream on demand.</p>
<p>fully agree. Things happen slowly so people adjust to it.</p>
<p>Just like when the video games stopped making people go outside? Or when television did? Or the movies? Or radio? Or books?</p>
<p>Can&#8217; be that far off. Kinect and Google Glasss is the start of it.</p>
<p>The erosion of personal privacy and liberty is depicted elegantly in this short, so I agree with you on your comment.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t make me excited for anything.</p>
<p>This is kind of cool, and kind of scary at the same time.</p>
<p>Very impressive video.</p>
<p>I think the real question that it brings up: Are 3 boobed women a good thing or bad thing?</p>
<p>Neat vid. What&#8217;s exciting to me is that this is the level we are starting at; we&#8217;re just scratching the surface and even that is so awesome, so imagine how insane it&#8217;s going to be 20 to 30 years after AR has gone matured to its full potential.</p>
<p>And this is not even taking into account the stuff we can do when we marry AR with real-world haptic feedback; for starters, devices, tools and equipment that build themselves out of thin air, on-demand and indistinguishable from a physical, touchable device&#8230;<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3mhgt.jpg" /><br />
 <br />
I just keep hoping and wishing that we get there in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer a jetpack :)</p>
<p>This made me feel awkward just watching it.</p>
<p>I thought the guy was going to pull an &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; move!!</p>
<p>The whole video  has a new sheen consummate professionalism.</p>
<p>This video makes me really sad.</p>
<p>This is like cheating, life experiences. I like it and I don&#8217;t at the same time.</p>
<p>I wonder if people would have said the same thing about our current Internet usage in life?</p>
<p>If this is the future, there&#8217;s going to be a lot of wasted vegetables.</p>
 technically, cucumbers are fruit 
<p>stupid html parser.. i meant that to be between: [smartass] [/smartass] tags :P</p>
<p>What an incredible short really had me sucked in.</p>
<p>Awesome! That&#8217;s good science fiction. That initial game he was playing reminded me of Sega&#8217;s Nights Into Dreams.</p>
<p>That guy looks so creepy.  Looks like he should be in Twilight.</p>
<p>So, you watch Twilight&#8230;..</p>
<p>(kidding)</p>
<p>Anybody looks creepy when their eyes are flashing.</p>
<p>Makes me think of Shadowrun or Cyperpunk. Loved it.</p>
<p>This was awesome. I kind of hope some of thise comes along in reality. Especially the fridge and cooking stuff.</p>
<p>Just date a virtual girlfriend lol.</p>
<p>Awesome video.</p>
<p>The most impressive / awesome / worrying thing about this film is how plausible a future it depicts. We&#8217;re on track to get there, even if we might still be decades away.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure.  The main reason why simplification trends are relatively popular today (at least from a design perspective) is because people don&#8217;t want information to be intrusive.  This short deluges the users with information constantly, which is ultimately distractingly &#8211; just as it is at the restaurant.  However, there are some useful aspects shown here, such as the &#8220;home screen.&#8221;  It only seems disconcerting because no one else can see what he sees (it&#8217;s just a blank wall), but on the other hand, it&#8217;s a completely private experience.  The film does lean toward some pretty dystopian ideas, though, including the news feed of cyanide cookies and the gamification of all things.</p>
<p>My vision of the future is one similar to that of Dennou Coil, which is a more simplistic (yet still informative) take on Google Glass.  Besides, the twist of this video is basically impossible with the use of cyber-brain technology, in which case AR-manipulation should be the least of one&#8217;s concerns.</p>
<p>*without</p>
<p>Seriously, how much coding does it take to install a damn edit button?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IA5Cv_5-g8" target="new">Three</a></p>
<p>Exactly my thoughts. The thing was stupid near the end because AR can&#8217;t give us that kind of control. Guy spent few seconds to completely take control of her, just said it once and she stopped. I can only see this being available to some government people, and like you said, only with cyber brain-implants that would be possible, which should well, be expected by her. Her fault she installed one, and if they force them it&#8217;s a whole different video that would be needed to explain.</p>
<p>But the short didn&#8217;t say it was only AR.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know what technology Sight uses to function, so there&#8217;s no reason to say it&#8217;s stupid. Besides, the woman had already alluded to rumours of mind control which the guy denied (and we see various sequences that would only work with some kind of &#8216;intention parsing)&#8217;, so we know potential mind control is something people are aware of but don&#8217;t fully believe/accept to be true. Therefore we know that the tech is potentially able to do it (for it to be a plausible rumour) and at the same time not fully understood by lay-people.<br />
Also he is a Sight engineer, so we can presume that he has access to this tech, and not just government people.</p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s this simple, AR doesn&#8217;t require anything implanted like that, giving that kind of control. If it does, then it&#8217;s not just AR anymore, and has more features.</p>
<p>Well I just mean to say that I hoped them to do it differently because find this idea to be not as much unrealistic as boring. They could have shown much more, and if they wanted to show this exact thing, they could do it better. To me it looks like they wanted both and didn&#8217;t succeed.</p>
<p>First of all, this is not a tech demo, it&#8217;s a short film.</p>
<p>Secondly, their system does require implants. because that&#8217;s what the film showed: either they require it for functionality (intent based control &#8211; thinking your reponses etc. which we saw happen &#8211; how else do you control the overlays like the film showed?)</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>It&#8217;s put in specifically with an ulterior motive of mind control.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know.. It&#8217;s a fictional system in a fictional world. We saw a system that can control minds therefore the system has implant that can control minds (and the story, as told, bore it out).</p>
<p>This film is disturbing. Most notably because: HE IS PLAYING <strong>SUPERMAN 64</strong>! Only a really sick bastard would do that in a future like that. Kind of gives away the ending too.</p>
<p>Scarily possible</p>
<p>that hexagon pattern around the sides would drive me crazy to no end.</p>
<p>Kol hakavod. Nicely done.</p>
<p>Information overload! It kind of seems like a social deterrent at times, still cool. Better UI than the Google Glass video demonstration.</p>
<p>Bring it on, I want my AR glasses!</p>
<p>I think aside from the dark ending to this film it was very well done technically.</p>
<p>I truly look forward to the day that we have such complex AR systems. I just hope security will be better by then (wishful thinking I know)</p>
<p>After reading the comments, I think I didn&#8217;t quite get the message. For me, this video is about how dangerous this &#8220;new reality&#8221; is for us. It shows that if something like that really existed, our lives could be easily controlled by anyone (by  &#8220;anyone&#8221; I mean governments, companies or maybe, as shown in the video, people). I think this video shows the future that we have to avoid.</p>
<p>This video is actually kind of stupid in the end. There is no reason for the girl to be &#8220;controllable&#8221;, using AR doesn&#8217;t equal it controlling you, that&#8217;s not well thought through on the side of the makers of the video. And even then, there are way, way easier ways to do such things even NOW. Ever heard of dating drugs? Have sex on first date, no problem. We will even have memory-erasing drugs very soon, too. Much sooner than this kind of AR is even in plans. That&#8217;s what you should be afraid of.</p>
<p>Yeah, I get your point, but I wasn&#8217;t talking only about the end. Since the beginning of the video I thought everything was a little&#8230; &#8220;1984-like&#8221;. And all the gamification thing, it&#8217;s really weird, obtrusive and&#8230; scary.</p>
<p>Interesting watch</p>
<p>Nice, so I guess even in the future, people are still using ICS in tablet mode with the SwiftKey keyboard, even though Google is probably on Android 6.0 &#8220;Marzipan&#8221; or something. ;-)</p>
<p><img src="http://luxography.ca/tmp/sight_systems_swiftkey.jpg" /></p>
<p>LOL. Good catch.</p>
<p>Correction: That is not even ICS! That is Honeycomb! <br />
Pardon me for the joke, but: It seems that Android fragmentation is so big that even in a AR future people are still stuck with Honeycomb. Damn OEMs!</p>
<p>Hrm, my Touchpad running CM9 (which is based on ICS) has that exact notification bar across the bottom, down to the icons and clock font.  My only other ICS device is the Galaxy Note, which is running in phone mode, so the notification shade is at the top&#8230;</p>
<p>Traycer, i got it now. That font and notification bar is also the same as Honeycomb&#8217;s non modified version (the pure google one). I own a Xoom, so i&#8217;m pretty used to it (btw, i totally prefer the pure ICS look which my Xoom is running now.).</p>
<p>So the OS at the image could be CM9, Honeycomb, &quot;Sight&quot;&#8217;s own software based on android with swiftkey, or anything else. But as the OS of the image don&#8217;t actually exist and as the video is pretty weird at the end, this is a good place to end my comment :P<br />
Hope Project Glass bring some cool things though.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was all for the technology shown in the video, until the last 20 seconds or so. :-/</p>
<p>Ugh, man, I totally missed the dr. Jekyll and mr. hyde poster the first time through (see behind the terminal). Oof.</p>
<p>Wow, I missed that too, this thing has easter eggs&#8230; who&#8217;da&#8217; thunk?</p>
<p>Very nice film.  Both scary and awesome at the same time.  I would differently be all in for something close to this.  Guess we&#8217;ll see what project glass brings us in a couple of years.</p>
<p>Anyone else find this short-film very creepy? I&#8217;m about half-way through, and the entire thing is incredibly creepy.</p>
<p>This was the first thing that popped into my mind. Everything is jacked into a network so overwhelming that people can practically be programmed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like watching the prelude to sci-fi rape. I was looking forward to something more like Office Future Vision.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Oh boy&#8230; That is creepy. I don&#8217;t even want to imagine a future like this.</p>
<p>Sorry for being dumb, but what was she doing at the end, in what appeared to be some sort of console?</p>
<p>he was hacking her brain.</p>
<p>Still a better love story than Twilight.</p>
<p>Oh god.</p>
<p>Project Glass might be a turn-off right now but in a decade you&#8217;ll be able to trick any woman into having sex with you. A worthy investment.</p>
<p>Well done but way too far-fetched.</p>
<p>So, from the looks of it, the &#8220;contact lens&#8221; must have built-in sensors for pheromone levels, speech pattern detection, etc.</p>
<p>Also, that last part was very &#8220;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&#8221;. Those who have played the game will get it.</p>
<p>Exactly what I was going to say. Anyone reading this, if you have not played DX:HR&#8230; PLAY IT!</p>
<p>This is amazing. Also, mind control.</p>
<p>I wonder about how the market will be divided between glasses and contact lenses.  I suspect in a lot of places contact lens versions will be illegal for regular folk.  Too much potential for misuse.<br />
Gaming will be a lot more interesting than base jumping.  Imagine creating a star fleet and having it park above your house or playing with real Pokemon in the park with your friends. Riding dinosaurs or flying to Mars.<br />
Eventually this will lead to a form of time travel.  Where everything in public and certain private areas is recorded so you can travel back to any point after recording started.  If your dog gets out of the yard you could rewind to that point and find out where it goes.  Major news events could be virtually visited and replayed exactly as they happened.</p>
<p>Can I opt out without dying?</p>
<p>Quite dystopian</p>
<p>Wow, this seems pointless. If this is the future and augmented reality is the mainstream, we will truly be living in a zombie apocalypse as the human race will be dumbed down to the point where apps and integrated chips replace our brains and worse of all, losing the key elements of life.</p>
<p>For all that are freaked out about thus video, 15 years ago (heck, 5 years ago) we would all be annoyed by the amount of time consumed by our smartphones in what would be very inappropriate places to someone from the past.</p>
<p>[couldn&#8217;t_resist]<br />
So this is how the Israelis plan on Oppressing the Palestinians in their homeland <br />
[/couldn&#8217;t_resist]</p>
<p>Well done overall, although three quarters of posters found this video disturbing. Not expected for the readership on a tech website&#8230;</p>
<p>My gripes: Why would she see <strong>his </strong>app on the wall? That doesn&#8217;t even remotely make sense. Also, the mind control thing is stupid. There&#8217;s science fiction and then there&#8217;s just fiction.</p>
<p>Also, this guy cannot cut vegetables to save his life.</p>
<p>I assumed in this universe they were substitutes for physical items, one could specify what shows up in his home rather than the user seeing the same specified things in every house they go to (The achievements would be similar to trophy&#8217;s people put on their shelves?)</p>
<p>But i agree it was rather silly, to bring a girl back to a bare apartment with nothing but a huge wall of &#8216;girl achievements&#8217;</p>
<p>Yes, most likely that&#8217;s what they had in mind. Which brings me to another topic: why do people want from virtual worlds to mimic the physical world?  Is it not exactly due to the differences that we are curious about virtual realities? Worth a separate discussion, IMO.</p>
<p>TV channels will continue to haunt us in the future? Gah!</p>
<p>As much as I enjoyed this, I didn&#8217;t enjoy everything. For one, I think that with such capabilities of video editing they should have done more of the outside scenes or something, not just spend half of the video for a date. Girl was beautiful and quite an actor while the guy&#8230;not quite so.</p>
<p>I got this one more thought though. The moment they show us that his apartment is near-empty and everything is AR. I never really thought about this, but it could be absolutely great for us if it happens! If only we can include enough processing power in a device small enough, creating such AR is a walk in the park. And by using it instead of, say, TVs and stuff, we can really reduce the material usage on the whole planet. I know it&#8217;s a very long shot and we won&#8217;t have this for God-knows-how-long, but still, when we do, it can benefit us hugely.</p>
<p>That is, if we don&#8217;t nuke the shit outta ourselves by then, which is pretty improbable if you ask me.</p>
<p>Why do they even need contacts with screens, when this &#8216;Sight&#8217; system apparently already includes neural connection? Interfacing with optic nerve or visual cortex directly would be an obvious choice.</p>
<p>Reminds me of this<br />
 <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT9G7pwyx39s46_iiNv5hZFUvGgRxrYaMOu68ku4pCRAmV7eSge" /><br />

<p>The future of date rape drugs &#8211; Sight.</p>
<p>this is kinda sad</p>
<p>This is not the AR I imagined.  Not a single reference to .223, piston vs. direct impingement, or optics platforms.</p>
<p>All it&#8217;s missing is a Google logo.</p>
<p>Science fiction would become reality because that is what people are trying to achieve. Tonnes of people are trying to make Star trek a reality.</p>
<p>The ending is why we can&#8217;t have nice things&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pity Vimeo sucks.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re all taking presentation lessons from Apple! Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t blame them and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a bad thing at all because these keynotes are that much more entertaining to watch. Steve Jobs would highlight his trip to Xeox as an example of learning from someone else.  Not really watched the Google keynotes before, impressed by the delivery especially when compared to the recent MS Surface keynote.  As for the glasses, being honest, would you not get some seriously odd looks? Who&#8217;s going to use these things except for the nerd core?  Technology is amazing though, feels like the future.</p>
<p>THIS IS THE FUTURE!</p>

<p>Was searching youtube.com/google for it the whole of yesterday and it turns out it&#8217;s actually uploaded at youtube.com/googledevelopers&#8230;</p>
<p>Man that&#8217;s a long keynote. I&#8217;m flicking forward to see what all the excitement round the skydiving was&#8230;</p>
<p>Am loving the new verge player, why didn&#8217;t you load up on that?</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t you guys make a post about PDK? sounds like a really important part of IO to me.</p>
<p>also app encryption and smart APK update. I suppose I will keep posting as I watch. ha</p>
<p>Yeah there was a lot of under the hood stuff that wasn&#8217;t reported.</p>
<p>also&#8230; i was disappointed w/ the LACK of talk on Google Wallet :( it might be dead..</p>
<p>Funny. Just used Wallet to pay for my Nexus7 pre-order. Zombie Wallet!</p>
<p>Psh, I put the keynote up two days ago. Of course, I only bothered putting up the first half, since the second half was all crap about Google+ (which I love, but really, not that interesting).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s funny how the bass in the opening seconds totally matches what they said about dubstep on the recent on the verge.</p>
<p>Come on guys, no gifs yet?</p>
<p>Wow, this is awesome. So awesome that Corning has to teach its customers how to actually use their product. I can&rsquo;t imagine what things are to come&hellip;</p>
<p>This is great to see.  What royally pisses me off and literally drives me up the wall is that certain afficienados will directly correlate this to the credit of the Honorary Late Jobs.  This is a totally deluded view and a direct blatant dismissal of the work of Corning.  Corning did this on their own accord and as you can see by the article this is an open technology for all.</p>
<p>literally</p>
<p>At least in smartphones and tablets I really do not see the use of a bendable display. In fact &ndash; I think its pointless.</p>
<p>However, maybe other forms of tech will come about that can make use of this? say a <strong>smartwatch</strong>?</p>
<p>Bendable displays are more durable/ shock resistant. That&#8217;s Corning&#8217;s angle.</p>
<p>I said this on the Engadget article too, but have you ever seen the TV show Gene Roddenberry&rsquo;s Earth Final Conflict?  They had communicator devices that folded the screen up to produce a cellphone/video camera, and then would allow the screen to be pulled out for tablet and video chat applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/graphics/content08/readius-cell-phone-final-conflict.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.technovelgy.com/graphics/content08/readius-cell-phone-final-conflict.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.movieprop.com/efcglobal2aa.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.movieprop.com/efcglobal2aa.jpg</a></p>
<p>I hope to see something like that in the future with this tech.</p>
<p>How is that any different from a current cell phone? It actually looks bulkier and has more moving parts that could be prone to failure.</p>
<p>Im not saying I dont think this is good tech, or that current tech is the best thing ever. Im just saying I havent seen/heard of anything that impresses me the way G Glass currently does&hellip;.</p>
<p>Now if they said this was leading up to an iron man phone, I would shit my pants and applaud.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.concept-phones.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Iron_Man_2_concept_phone.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Till then.</p>
<p>My thinking is that I could carry around a 7 or 8 inch tablet that folds up into a package a little larger than a flip phone, and when I just want to use the camera or talk on it, I&rsquo;m not having to hold onto a big bulky screen, and when I want to use apps, or surf the web I&rsquo;m not doing it on a tiny screen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it would look exactly like those, just that I like the idea of a phone/tablet hybrid that lets me adjust the screen size/form factor to what I&rsquo;m actually using it for, and isn&rsquo;t as cumbersome as carrying around a 7+ inch tablet.</p>
<p>Yea im not sure how they will make glass that can fold like paper.</p>
<p>This article is talking about Flexible displays, which is totally different from foldable.</p>
<p>Cool idea though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152423447395626">Samsung Youm Displays</a></p>
<p>Samsung seems to be making just that</p>
<p>Yeah, Youm displays look promising, this is really innovative.<br />
I can&rsquo;t wait to have this kind of devices: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7vZtZw-JxM" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7vZtZw-JxM</a></p>
<p>Pretty cool and pretty innovative, but still so far off for that phone and tablet combo.</p>
<p>The stick thing that had a screen slide out, just looks like a gimmick to be honest. Not interested in that at all.</p>
<p>Foldable?<br />
I don&rsquo;t think that one could make a device like the one Warbert mentioned by folding the screen&hellip;<br />
The screen would rather roll up, so it would only need to be flexible.</p>
<p>Besides, the device he mentioned is much more different from current devices than the Iron Man&rsquo;s one, which is actually totally off topic because it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with foldability, just transparency.</p>
<p>*nothing to do with <em>flexibility</em></p>
<p>The point I was making was that transparent glass (ala the iron man phone) is more interesting (to me personally) than a foldable display that will have few uses.</p>
<p>This is not a point, it&rsquo;s a strictly personal opinion.<br />
I respect it, but I don&rsquo;t agree.<br />
And still some of the statements you made were wrong.<br />
Not only is a device like the one mentioned by Warbert completely different from current ones, contrary to what you implied, but its flexible screen could even be transparent, making it way more interesting than a simple piece of transparent glass.</p>
<p>/shrug</p>
<p>Even with curved/flexible glass, it doesn&rsquo;t mean flexible phones. Even with flexible battery tech, it doesn&rsquo;t mean flexible phones.</p>
<p>There are so many more components that have to become flexible before we have a chance of a flexible phone. and a lot of those don&rsquo;t have any light at the end of the tunnel yet.</p>
<p>unbreakable displays</p>
<p>Agreed, Samsung also showed off transparent panels (used in a refrigerator and one for apartment buildings / offices last year at <span class="caps">CES</span>.  The fruity company didn&rsquo;t invent that either.  Other companies did and they deserve the credit.  It will be cool when we get Minority Report style curved transparent displays for computing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s the message from Corning Glass Technologies president James Clappin,bq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know I know&hellip; I just couldn&rsquo;t go past this point with that image of him in my head..  clappin</p>
<p>Apple is there most prominent customer? Err.. No, it&#8217;s easily Samsung, and Apple has no flexible display technology whatsoever whereas Samsung has actually shown Youm displays working, not being a fanboy but don&#8217;t be pro-Apple The Verge, you&#8217;re one of the few tech sites I trust.</p>
<p>Developers be developing&#8230;.</p>
<p>Developers, Developers,  Developers,  Developers,  Developers,  Developers,  Developers,  Developers,  Developers,  Developers&#8230;</p>
<p>DEVELOPERS</p>
<p><img src="http://andrewcurrie.ca/ee/images/uploads/ballmer.jpg" /></p>
<p>I GOT THE POWER!<br />
&#8230;to develop.</p>
<p>Developers, Developers, Developers, Developers</p>
<p>getting old</p>
<p>Ballmer is getting old. You&#8217;re right. His developers line getting old though? Never!</p>
<p>getting old? but there&#8217;s still so much to do with it&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=KMU0tzLwhbE" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KMU0tzLwhbE</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8M6S8EKbnU" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8M6S8EKbnU</a></p>
<p>Then come up with some other meme that includes developers and make in displace Ballmer&#8217;s MonkeyBoy. Or is your &#8220;Challenge Accepted&#8221; nick just you being a smarta**?</p>
<p>Are all the components in the little bit in his hand? If so that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>
<p>Why are there no pictures of someone wearing the glasses?</p>
<p>Because this one really is ugly as sin?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a picture above of Dieter wearing the glasses, and he&#8217;s wearing them in the video. What more do you want?</p>
<p>It is very ugly and bulky, no thank you. I&#8217;ll wait for Google Glass because it will be amazing and my X Phone will connect to it magically.</p>
<p>Careful. Doing anything &#8220;magically&#8221; is patented by you-know-who.</p>
<p>Wait, why have the glass when you have to use your phone anyway?</p>
<p>Because strapping your phone to your glasses is kinda clunky.</p>
<p>Good concept, low polish so far. The idea of it just simply running Android apps heads up seems like a real waste, not to mention the low transparency.</p>
<p>Still waiting for Glass.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like them to develop a wireless headphone/display combo for wireless streaming from your PC. If you are watching a video on your PC and need to do something in a next door room (preparing something to eat, cleaning, working out,&#8230;) you could continue listening to your video and if something interesting is mentioned you can quickly peak to the upper left at your smart glass.</p>
<p>This would be ideal for video podcasts or video lectures on YouTube or iTunes U.</p>
<p>I thought the point of these glasses was immediate and at a glance action. Having to pull out a smartphone to operate a touchpad seems incredibly backwards. The touchpad should be built into the glasses. The interface should be a simple swipe click paradigm. No cursors, no extra accessories required.</p>
<p>Yep, totally agree. If I have to get out my smartphone, why wouldn&#8217;t I just use it&#8217;s superior screen, camera and UI to shoot some video, take a photo etc? It just seems counter-intuitive to the whole purpose of wearable computers to have to operate them from another device. If you have to launch Instagram from your phone, why not just launch Instagram ON your phone. I&#8217;ll be waiting for Google Glass too.</p>
<p>It seems like a big gimmick. Using your phone to launch apps when you have a 4-5 inch display in your hand that is most likely pretty high-res, but instead you choose to use a small VGA display that obstructs your view and also is very hard to see. Wow.</p>
<p>these single eye glasses solutions seem a little odd.<br />
what about a stereo set with variable transparency to allow you to see the world around you when you&#8217;re not doing something?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to love how Google have been able to control the story around smart glasses!</p>
<p>These are described as a <em>&#8220;competitor to Google&#8217;s Project Glass&#8221;</em>, a <strong><em>product</em></strong> which for all intents and purposes&#8230; <strong><em>doesn&#8217;t actually exist!</em></strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s smart PR by Google. It really is.</p>
<p>They <strong><em>knew</em></strong> this kind of tech was in the pipeline. By going public with Project Glass they have copped a little bit of flak for promoting vapourware&#8230; but they have put themselves in a position to control the story on smart glasses for years to come.</p>
<p>Geee&#8230;. Let&#8217;s see. A product that does not exist is a competitor to another product that does not exist. What bugs you is that one of them is Google.</p>
<p>It drives me nuts if I have a water spot on my glasses.  To have this thing hanging in front of my eye and obstructing my view would turn me into a psycho killer in seconds.  The worst part is, I&#8217;d be a ridiculous looking psycho killer wearing this thing &#8211; and frankly, that&#8217;s a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>Then don&#8217;t get it?</p>
<p>Pair this with eye tracking and implant it directly into your head so it&#8217;s not hanging over your vision :D</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t ever see myself wanting to wear any type of device like this. Sometimes I feel like we are too connected. It&#8217;s nice to free yourself from technology every now and then.</p>
<p>Our senior design team was researching vuzix stuff a couple years ago.  Glad to see the company getting better.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous</p>
<p>Since this is a companion to your smart phone and Glass is suppose to be it&#8217;s own device, would this make it less of a Glass competitor and more a new accessory?  And it seems a lot more intrusive as the screen, though it sits just below your eye, is still RIGHT THERE.  With Glass that they showed at I/O 2012, it was definitely away from the eye more.</p>
<p>An uglier, less functional version of Glass? <em>Score.</em></p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ll just be over here waiting for Google to take my money&#8230;.</p>
<p>For looking to up their Bluedouche game?</p>
<p>For <strong>those</strong>&#8230; dammit, never mind&#8230; (Can I haz edit, The Verge?)</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to play GTA V for Xbox 360 on <em>the new</em> Xbox.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand why they aren&#8217;t releasing it for the new console&#8230; Unless the new Xbox won&#8217;t be out until Christmas</p>
<p>We are quickly running out of time for even a 2013 launch.  Little chance that a console will release the holiday season after it&rsquo;s announced at E3, it&rsquo;s only happened maybe once or twice in the history of the industry.</p>
<p>Microsoft did it with the 360, I don&rsquo;t see why they wouldn&rsquo;t do it here.</p>
<p>They wanted to do everything to beat Sony and they had a lot of issues with the early consoles. I think they are a bit smarter right now. But I do want a better XBox with Kinect that doesn&rsquo;t lag at all.</p>
<p>Microsoft announced it at <span class="caps">CES</span> long before E3 that year.  Which is what I meant about running out of time&hellip;so no, that&rsquo;s not what happened with the 360.</p>
<p>&hellip;what new console? Are they expecting to wait for another year to release it? The next console hasn&rsquo;t even been announced yet.</p>
<p>I think the smartphone/tablet market has made us incredibly impatient.</p>
<p>Come fall it will have been 8 years, so ya I&rsquo;m ready for new hardware.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s a big 10-4</p>
<p>I think Rockstar was actually waiting for the new system. I believe they designed GTAV with the new capabilities of the next Xbox in mind. They probably got to a point where they were mostly finished with developing the game, but the next Xbox was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Do we scrap it? Do we &ldquo;dumb it down&rdquo; for 360? Do we wait some more?</p>
<p>At this point, they&rsquo;d rather just get it out there now on the 360 since it&rsquo;s done, then re-release it on the next Xbox for double their cash. Now they can move on to GTAV Part 2 (aka GTAVI).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s it &ndash; isn&rsquo;t Rockstar pretty good at pushing back release dates? Delays happen in the industry for reasons other than waiting on unannounced consoles. I would find that fairly irresponsible &ndash; all that money poured into development time and then they&rsquo;re just going to sit on it and wait?</p>
<p>By the time <span class="caps">GTA</span> V hits, it&rsquo;ll have been over 5 years since <span class="caps">GTA</span> IV was released. All we&rsquo;ve seen since then is expansion packs and handheld/mobile games. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s half &ldquo;we&rsquo;re tired of waiting&rdquo; and half &ldquo;we hope you bring out a new system sometime in the next 12 months for us to jump over to&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d much rather <span class="caps">GTA</span> V be a massive over-the-top upgrade using new hardware, but this will basically be a super-polished <span class="caps">GTA</span> IV&hellip; and I skipped that game for Saint&rsquo;s Row.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All we&rsquo;ve seen since then is expansion packs and handheld/mobile games</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, you know, Red Dead Redemption, LA Noire, and Max Payne 3. Not like they&rsquo;ve just been twiddling their thumbs.</p>
<p>While I love those games, my point still stands. I didn&rsquo;t say they weren&rsquo;t working on anything, I said they were waiting on better hardware before working on another <span class="caps">GTA</span>. I don&rsquo;t think they could top IV on the PS3 other than minor polishing. They want an explosive upgrade, and the PS4 would be able to provide that.</p>
<p>In light of recent Playstation news, we now know why that wait is over.</p>
<p>Rockstar said that they&rsquo;re good with current console graphics. Unfortunately nobody ask us :/</p>
<p>Actually no that is totally wrong. They never planned to release <span class="caps">GTA</span> V on next gen consoles. It was specifically designed for current gen consoles. They built the <span class="caps">RAGE</span> game engine for this generation. That is why the <span class="caps">GTA</span> IV development was so long. They where still developing <span class="caps">RAGE</span> alongside it. <span class="caps">GTA</span> V development was a lot quicker as the game engine was already built.</p>
<p>Also financially it makes no sense to build a huge expensive game engine for this generation and only use it a handful of times. <span class="caps">GTA</span> V is going to be printing money for them as the development costs of the game engine have already been paid off.</p>
<p>So, the option is:</p>
<p>1) Spend money releasing on consoles with a low install base despite having probably designed the game for this lot of consoles.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) Release on consoles with 70m install base each (PS3 &amp; 360 each) and release it this year.</p>
<p>Because 150+ million people own current generation consoles.  It will take a long time to sell enough next gen consoles for it to be worth it to have an exclusive GTA game.</p>
<p>Because <strong>years</strong> of work go into a game like this. Tens of millions of dollars do too. They may not have had a working next Xbox prototype to start development with. They started when their development cycle could be started and the result is an Xbox 360 game.</p>
<p>Come E3 Microsoft will say something like, &ldquo;Oh, hey, SURPRISE! Those who have Kinect have already been using the next Xbox!&rdquo; and we&rsquo;ll all be like &hellip; o_O</p>
<p>No!!!! I want to play this game now.</p>
<p>SEPTEMBER?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/">NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</a></p>
<p>I love buying refreshed games two or three months after a new console comes out.</p>
<p>Refreshed meaning they&#8217;ll update it for the new console?</p>
<p>For sure. They get your money twice this way. Much better than waiting for the new system to hit and then porting over, fixing any minor changes in the new platform.</p>
<p>This is sad and not even a Cover.<br />
My most anticipated Game ever.</p>
<p>well, at least the graphics are oldschool.</p>
<p>September&hellip; on the 360&hellip;&hellip;. a little too late with the next gen on its way.</p>
<p>Right. All the millions of existing 360s will magically convert into new gen consoles on the day of new gen&rsquo;s release. Man, the developer of GTA5 is seriously stupid.</p>
<p>all copies arent sold day 1&hellip; Im guessing he&rsquo;s getting at the fact that it wont have enough time to be the &lsquo;hot game&rsquo; on shelves.. even make it to &lsquo;platinum&rsquo; or &lsquo;best-sellers&rsquo; status.. to rack in more sales.. a big budget game like this needs all the revenue it can throughout a longer life cycle.</p>
<p>Yet the install base for the new systems wouldn&rsquo;t allowed it a record breaking launch anyway.  Also, we have no concrete evidence of a launch even this year for PS4 or the next Xbox, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure they may be aware of something we are not.</p>
<p>I can guarantee you that Rockstar already knows exactly when the new consoles are coming out. If they think it&rsquo;s OK to release in September for this generation, they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>The new consoles are generally released in November anyways, and two months is plenty of time for a major game to get most of it&rsquo;s sales, not to mention the first year of console sales is rarely the biggest.</p>
<p>That should give me a little over 2 months to enjoy before I jump ship to next-gen. I&rsquo;m pretty sure backwards compatibility will be out of the question. It was a pain the ass for MS to do it the first time, they quietly just let it die once people stopped caring about it. To their credit they made MvC2 playable on Xbox360, after that I was all set.</p>
<p>Less a pain, they just stopped caring. Most of the major games were made compatible anyway. No one cares about &ldquo;My little ponies 2&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sad, but fine, I already have a ton of my plate game wise this first semester.</p>
<p>Maybe the new consoles will have backwards compatibility, so that&rsquo;s why Rockstar isn&rsquo;t too worry about next gen consoles.</p>

<p>Why does it matter that this is going to be a current gen game? It looks good enough as it is; get over your <em>graphics obsessed</em> selves already.</p>
<p>Yep. Lets not ever progress in graphics, performance, or design. It is good enough as it is.</p>
<p>Damn these people and their want for progression over 7 year old hardware.</p>
<p>I never said we shouldn&rsquo;t progress, it just humours me when people get hung up over the graphics of a single game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like this game looks bad anyway.</p>
<p>Remember, it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">GTA</span>, a game predominantly focused on game-play and entertainment value..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never said we shouldn&rsquo;t progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You sort of did. If it is good enough, then any progress would be just wasted time and effort.</p>
<p>A game is enhanced with better graphics, better performance, more horsepower to aid a more ambitious game design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more annoyed because the game&rsquo;s art direction and generally good design is hampered by low resolution, low framerate and full of aliasing. I don&rsquo;t know how you can blame people for wanting a better experience.</p>
<p>I know it is cool to pretend graphics and performance don&rsquo;t matter, but they do enhance a game. Yes, it isn&rsquo;t the be-all and end-all, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be for it to be considered a significant part of the experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You sort of did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sort of</em> isn&rsquo;t explicit and therefore shouldn&rsquo;t be interpreted as so.</p>
<p>I think we should agree to disagree here. I understand your perspective and I understand that many people agree with you, but there is also a growing minority of gamers who don&rsquo;t judge games on graphics.</p>
<p>I also disagree with the idea that <em>better graphics, better performance, more horsepower</em> will <em>aid a more ambitious game design</em>. I think it&rsquo;s a common misconception that design&mdash;at least in this context&mdash;is a linear system; i.e. bigger numbers, more of this, more of that and lots of power are not necessarily fuel for creativity or enhanced game design. This is where my opinion becomes semantic, because I do think they can be, I just don&rsquo;t think they are always the answer.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s quite plain to see that some of the most successful recent bouts of creative design have been born from the indie genre, a place where a game can still sell millions of copies regardless of how many polygons are being rendered.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not being forced to buy or even play the game, if you don&rsquo;t like it then don&rsquo;t do either. The future progression of gaming isn&rsquo;t dependant on this single franchise.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Perhaps this is a bit too blunt of a critique, but I still stand behind my motivation for writing it and I think I have made my view clear now.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/08940b02bfdaa1b60e996ff15588d5f4/tumblr_mfq8nhQQGh1rti993o1_500.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>No one said graphics and horsepower are the fuel for creativity, the argument is that they can help achieve the creative vision.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ll give you something like Planetside 2, that experience is enhanced by having a massive battlefield full of thousands of players, with vehicles, aircraft fighting above you, huge convoys of tanks, masses of people rushing towards a base &ndash; having that huge persistent battlefield, one huge war is enhanced by having the horsepower to actually achieve that, and make it look great at the same time.</p>
<p>Games are often intended to be immersive experiences, and higher graphical fidelity and performance (as not to interrupt you) only aid that. Rockstar attempt to make their worlds believable (which doesn&rsquo;t mean realistic), a believable world isn&rsquo;t just the result of good graphics, it is a combination of lots of things, the writing, the characters, the design, but it is enhanced by graphics.</p>

<p>What an odd answer. I&rsquo;m not even sure how you got to this conclusion, I&rsquo;m sad that it isn&rsquo;t an option, on launch, to experience this game with current-level technology, to see and experience the world they&rsquo;ve created in a higher fidelity, higher performance setting. It may be a small thing, but it would <strong>undoubtably</strong> enhance the experience, regardless of how significant that may be for an individual.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad about that, that doesn&rsquo;t mean I still don&rsquo;t want to play it, doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m still not immensely excited about playing it.</p>
<p>I argue with people on this because I never understood this viewpoint. People complaining that others want graphical fidelity to continue to progress. How is that <em>anything</em> but a good thing? No one is suggesting that they should be the focus of the development of a game, no one is saying they are what make a game great, but they can make an experience better.</p>
<p>Journey is enhanced by its pretty graphics because it helps you believe in this world, it helps immersion into that world, and is a requirement for you to get some sort of emotional attachment to the Journey. Yes, you can tell the same story and play the same game with lesser graphical fidelity, but it is a better experience.</p>
<p>This news makes me somewhat skeptical that the new consoles will come out this fall at all. Awfully close to the holiday season for such a big title so late in this gens life cycle&#8230;. How I&#8217;m wrong though!</p>
<p>Wish they would release the game on my summer school vacation though</p>
<p>Thank you, Rockstar, for shitting all over the PC gamers.</p>
<p>I know! How dare they not allocate enormous time and effort to create a version of a game that would likely delay the release of the game on all other platforms and would probably not make them enough money to make it feasible?!</p>
<p>yea. like, how dare they use a PC to make the games for console.</p>
<p>1. thats bullshit, GTA is nothing special, most games are released on 360/PS3/PC with only exclusivity playing a role in release dates<br />
2. GTA always sells more than enough to pay for itself on all platforms &ndash; PC sales of rockstar games are lower because they are releasing them 1+ year later (if ever) but still strong</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited, hopefully it&rsquo;s not filled with bugs as San Andreas or IV.</p>
<p>The bugs often made GTA even more fun.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was funny to be unable to play certain missons and have to download save files.</p>
<p>I wanna it NOW<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>I want to it now, too.</p>
<p>Wow, Nintendo. This game is coming out basically a year after the Wii U debuted and it&rsquo;s not making it to your system. This is a problem.</p>
<p>So a game that&rsquo;s in development for years on other consoles should be ported to Wii U immediately?  There&rsquo;s a problem here, the perception that a new console gets every new title &ndash; it&rsquo;s never been that way, especially for Nintendo.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the thing. Many people thought the Wii U was supposed to be different than the Wii, and actually get games like this on release instead of a stripped down version months later.</p>
<p>If this game is being delayed yet again, it&rsquo;s obvious they didn&rsquo;t even have the resources to complete the 360/PS3 launch on time &ndash; and you would expect them to have a Wii U port in the wings?   It&rsquo;s just not practical.</p>
<p>They should just add maps on the control or inventory screen than just port it.</p>
<p>/S</p>
<p>i still have faith it will come to Wii U.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Rockstar has had a development kit for Wii U for about six months now, even though I expect they have had access for much longer than that. You&rsquo;re telling me that they couldn&rsquo;t get a Wii U version together in 15 months if they wanted to? That&rsquo;s crazy talk.</p>
<p>By September, the Wii U shouldn&rsquo;t be considered a new console anymore.</p>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t get the PS3 or 360 version together on time&hellip;think about it.</p>
<p>Delayed to finish next-gen ports&hellip;  Based on the original rumors of &ldquo;Spring 2013&rdquo;, I wouldn&rsquo;t be shocked.</p>
<p>Amazon said March.<br />
Amazon lied.<br />
I cried.</p>
<p>Fuck, I was hoping to play it all summer long. Now I&rsquo;ll have to choose between playing this or paying attention during the first semester&hellip;..and that&rsquo;s if I even get enough sleep to go to classes from playing this</p>
<p>Since the next generation of consoles don&rsquo;t &ldquo;exist&rdquo; to consumers yet, why would Rockstar announce games for them? My guess is once the new consoles are announced, Rockstar will announce GTAV for them in addition to current-gen. Could be wrong though.</p>
<p>How disappointing. They <em>must</em> be working on the next gen version as well to delay the 360 and PS3 versions by almost 3.5 months.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re setting yourself up for even more disappointment now, especially if you&rsquo;re that certain you&rsquo;re even getting new consoles this year.</p>
<p>Whoa, on my birthday! :-D</p>
<p>I <em>want</em> to buy this on the Wii U because it&rsquo;s a cool console and to help dispel the &ldquo;only 1st party titles sell on a Nintendo system&rdquo; notion.  But it seems like that won&rsquo;t be possible barring a surprise E3 announcement.</p>
<p>Hi 360.</p>
<p>As a Wii U owner, let me just say that I absolutely love it. That being said, I bought it with the expectation of only playing games like Lego City with my kids and Nintendo&rsquo;s big releases, so I can&rsquo;t be too mad that games like <span class="caps">GTA</span> and Bioshock Infinite aren&rsquo;t going to make it to the Wii U.</p>
<p>SepfuckingTEMBER?</p>
<p>Probably means while the new consoles will be announced at E3, They won&rsquo;t be out until much later in the fall or winter or maybe even 2014.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar has announced that Grand Theft Auto V&hellip; will be released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 September 17th. <strong>That&rsquo;s a few months later than the spring timeframe</strong> Rockstar was originally shooting for&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>few</em> months? That&rsquo;s at least 4 months.</p>
<p>As long as it plays on my 720.</p>
<p>PC version?</p>
<p>In may I would have played some of it, but in the fall I&rsquo;ll be busy with other stuff and other games. So i guess sorry <span class="caps">GTA</span>.</p>
<p>Just buy it next spring for like $30.</p>
<p>Anyone notice no guns in the video?</p>
<p>Did you not notice the gun in the dude&rsquo;s hand when the bank vault blew off? The static image for the video, indicating &lsquo;Trailer 2&rsquo;, also shows a gun in one of the protagonists hands.</p>
<p>Sooooooo&#8230;. Apparently, the PS4 or Project Orbis is going to be released this holiday and announced in February. Where we goin&#8217; with this?</p>
<p>Apple will be doing all this stuff with Apple TV very soon but it will be &#8220;finished&#8221; and you won&#8217;t need an xbox to use it. It&#8217;s a good step forward but not enough.</p>
<p>Apple, Apple, Apple<br />
Apple will also do X with iY very soon that you won&#8217;t need Z</p>
<p>Do you need to bring Apple to this?, sigh</p>
<p>Yeah I think so, Apple will be the leader in this kind of thing so it&#8217;s very relevant. THey already have everything in place, iPhones, iPads and Apple TV.</p>
<p>Microsoft just has the xbox right now, the phone aren&#8217;t selling and the tablets aren&#8217;t even out there yet really. Apple are way ahead is this area right now.</p>
<p>Smart glass works on all platforms, you only need a smart phone/tablet on iOS, Android/Metro.</p>
<p>The only other thing you need is an Xbox, and i&#8217;m pretty sure xbox owners have one of those smart device so literally the install base is already there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really into console gaming any more, So I wouldn&#8217;t go out and buy an xbox just to use this, the Apple TV is much more appealing in this situation.</p>
<p>Either way, you&#8217;re having to buy something.  Just stop acting like buying a 360 is such a big deal when people would still be stuck having to buy Apple TVs, too.</p>
<p>Microsoft wins this round, hands down.  All you need is an Xbox and any tablet and/or any phone.  For Apple TV, you need an iPhone and/or an iPad.  An Xbox has apps that cover more media than the Apple TV.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that the 360 already has a exceedingly expansive lead against the Apple TV when it comes to market penetration.  The 360 is the top-selling console in the <strong>world<strong>.  The Apple TV&#8230;not so much&#8230;</strong></strong></p>
<p>The HBO Go iPad app has had this enhanced content for a while: interactive map of Westeros, information on all the houses, timecode-linked additional content. It&#8217;s a matter of time before there&#8217;s an AirPlay solution that splits the content between the AppleTV and iPad app.</p>
<p>And their demo works. ;)</p>
<p>Also, if Apple were competing with the XBox with their own console, <strong>your comparison would be more meaningful.</strong></p>
<blockquote>Also, if Apple were competing with the XBox with their own console, your comparison would be more meaningful.</blockquote>
<p>Conversely, the Xbox wasn&#8217;t directly competing with the Apple TV until now, but it still managed to take about 25% of the digitial video market away from Apple, and this without a huge marketing push for Zune.</p>
<p>Now MS is actively going for it by rebranding Zune as Xbox media, and including it with Windows, instead of just having the Zune service on the console, and as a separate download for the PC that never gained a lot of traction.</p>
<p>Also, a lot more Xbox 360s out there than Apple TVs, and once Smartglass rolls out, it will be available on multitude of platforms, instead of existings solely with Apple products.</p>
<p>The Xbox brand has evolved over the years to become something more than just gaming.  The average Xbox in the US is on for over 60 hours a month, up from 40 hours a year earlier, and most of that increased usage is for media, not gaming.  Gaming hasn&#8217;t gone DOWN, but media now accounts for over half of the usage.</p>
<p>But you also have to pay the MS tax to enable all the media streaming services. $200 (at least) for an Xbox plus $60 a year vs $100 for an AppleTV and no yearly subscription fee. You say that the Xbox has more apps, but if you have an iPhone or ioad, then any app that plays media can stream it to your TV. Xbox doesn&#8217;t have PBS, NPR, or Adult Swim, but the Apple TV can access this content and much more for free. No subscription fee.</p>
<p>If your not into multiplayer online gaming (most people aren&#8217;t), the Xbox is a pretty big rip off as a media set top box.</p>
<p>Adult Swim is on Xbox. and who pays $60 for Gold? Microsoft always has a deal up on the dashboard for: 1mo-$1, 3mo-$5, 13mo,-30 almost every other week.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t even include the countless discounts for Gold in stores and Amazon. I&#8217;m currently renewed up to 2015 and only paid 40 myself</p>
<p>But can you play all of the best top tier games and online with friends with the Apple TV? Does the Apple TV have the best user interface?</p>
<p>No&#8230;and No. Most people don&#8217;t have Apple TVs. A hell of a lot of people have Xbox 360s. It&#8217;s a smart move that Microsoft will allow the iPad and Android devices to work with the 360. They have wisely recognized that it&#8217;s a smart way to get more people using the Xbox 360 rather than alienating users of Android and iPhone devices.</p>
<p>Dude, did you even read the article?</p>
<p>of course not, for the Apple faithful, Apple invented everything, the telephone, the TV, the car, the internet, the Universe.</p>
<p>For the faithful, all Apple products are a priori, superior to everything else..</p>
<p>Why do people get so whipped up about meaningless debates like Apple vs. Microsoft and take it so personally?</p>
<p>Let both products come out, exist at the same time, and compete.  I will buy the one that works the best/suits my needs regardless of who makes it.  This fanboyism drives me nuts and really undermines the goal that the folks at The Verge strive for.</p>
<p>does apple TV works with android? win 8 / wp ? no? humm then i rather buy an xbox instead of apple tv iphone &amp; ipad and get the console experience AND i can use any TV i want. I think MS will be ahead in 2013. Sorry, fanboy</p>
<p>Windows:<br />
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2280" target="_blank">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2280</a></p>
<p>Android:<br />

<p>So, yeah.</p>
<p>Will Apple provide an app for Android / WP that can &#8220;listen&#8221; to what is being played on the Apple TV and update the content of the app in function ? <br />
Will you be able to use your WP/Android as a secondary controler when playing games on the Apple TV ? <br />
Can you play games on an Apple TV ? (No sarcasm, it&#8217;s a serious question &#8211; I never saw one of those things IRL)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be more inclined to fork out $200-$400 for an Xbox depending on model and country and hooking it up to my current TV than buying the apple TV in the 1.5-4K range.</p>
<p>Apple TV is $99</p>
<p>you forget the Apple Tv you are talking about will be replaced by the real soon to be released Apple TV. Which will probably cost more.</p>
<p>Negative.  Show me a roadmap from Apple that states that.  Rumor and speculation are useless in this conversation.  $99 is the cost for Apple TV.</p>
<p>It may cost 99 but current consoles are still better. They could do most of what the AppleTV can do and play pretty amazing games.</p>
<p>Apple don&#8217;t do roadmaps. Everyone knows this.</p>
<p>For many millions of people, that already own the Xbox 360, $99 is still another purchase and platform to buy. So while it may seem like a small amount, why would anyone bother getting another box that is way less functional, than just using a new feature like project glass on the 360?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the fees for Xbox Live Gold. Can&#8217;t use it as a set top box without paying the MS tax.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 5 dollar a month, i pretty sure that anybody that buy Xboxes and Apple TV have more than 5 buck to spare, Not mentioning you could get it in nearly half price in Amazon Deals</p>
<p>But nobody else charges a fee to connect Netflix to the internet. Why should MS? I&#8217;m not just going to pay something because it&#8217;s &#8216;not that much&#8217;. The point is, it&#8217;s a bad value.</p>
<p>Its not a bad value&#8230; its a great value. The apps get updated, new apps come out, the 3.00 a month it costs is an extremely good ROI.. (you can buy discount cards on amazon all the time..)   Paying a small service fee means the life of the hardware  is extended because the value return to MS and its customers is extended support on software.  Without XBL and its very affordable fees, i don&#8217;t think we would have the functionality and services we have today.   When Cable tv used to cost me 90 bucks a month and i can replace it with something that costs 200.00 a year for unlimited netflix, unlimited amazon prime and xbox live + gaming.. you simply can&#8217;t beat that.</p>
<p>The Xbox is still expensive (to anyone who isn&#8217;t interested in console gaming), noisy, and there&#8217;s no reason they should charge you a monthly fee to watch Netflix. It&#8217;s just stupid. And this is coming from someone who plays about 3 hours of Fifa every day on it.</p>
<p>MS needs to offer a $99 Xbox Lite to compete with the Apple TV, and if they&#8217;re going to keep charging for XBL, they need to bundle more free media content. TV shows, one free movie rental per week, SOMETHING.</p>
<p>Kind of like the $99 Xbox trial they are marketing now.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like that, though. I don&#8217;t know how many new customers they&#8217;re going to gain, offering 5 year old hardware at clearance pricing, 1 year before the new new with full W8 support comes out.</p>
<p>I hope we see a $99-199 lightweight, first-party W8/Xbox hybrid. I wouldn&#8217;t bet on it, though.</p>
<p>About the same rate or higher as they are selling now which is over 100k units per week.  It&#8217;s not about what you think or feel, it is what the data shows and supports.  It is showing the Xbox is still selling like hotcakes with 5 year old constantly improved tech.</p>
<p>A &#8220;$99 &#8211; $199&#8221; Windows 8/Xbox 360 hybrid?</p>
<p>Come on man, lets be realistic here.  <br />
The current ecosystem that Microsoft has in place is incredibly in-depth, and their hard work is worth a lot more than negative currency.. which is what they&#8217;d make if they charged $200 for hardware.  Get real.</p>
<p>the Xbox is $200 now.</p>
<p>Sorry but the current Xbox is not noisy.  Maybe the first gen, but not the latest.</p>
<p>You forget all the free crap you get, like ESPN&#8230; Oh, and ask Sony customers how it feels that PSN got hacked 5 times. That&#8217;s another reason I don&#8217;t have a problem playing 30 bucks a year  (which is the MOST I ever pay for XBL), because they charge monthly for XBL, they can afford decent security. Also, you do have cloud storage as well, so it&#8217;s not just 30 bucks to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>hahahaha! Xbox needs to compete with the Apple TV? Are you serious? They aren&#8217;t even in the same league.</p>
<p>The Apple TV is barely a successful product. It never has really been since it&#8217;s inception. There are a lot of reasons for that.</p>
<p>The Xbox on the other hand is the dominant gaming / home media platform of our day. It eclipsed titans like Nintendo and Sony. Apple is not even in the conversation here.</p>
<p>How many other Netflix clients allow you to party chat with a group while watching content? How many allows you to stay connected to Xbox Live for messaging and game invites? Netflix on Xbox Live is thee best Netflix solution in the living room, and certainly better than ATV.</p>
<p>&#8220;buy an Xbox&#8221;</p>
<p>There are more Xbox&#8217;s in the world than Apple TV&#8217;s. It would be more common for someone to be in the reverse of your situation. I&#8217;m sorry Micorosoft didn&#8217;t call you and make arrangements so user shaunwilinson&#8217;s on the Verge would be happy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick of my 360 as this &#8220;media device&#8221;. It does exactly one thing for me: play Fifa 12. It&#8217;s loud, uses more electricity, and I hate the UI as well as all them embedded ads.</p>
<p>I much prefer using my Apple TV. Airplay rocks my socks, and being able to type using the QWERTY on my iDevices kicks ass.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s good to see MS finally offering <strong>some</strong> cross-platform functionality, they have a long ways to go. Give me Office on Android/iOS. Create an Xbox Music app for Android/iOS. It&#8217;s a step in the right direction, but this feature isn&#8217;t going to keep people from buying a new $99 Apple TV when it adds support for 3rd party apps and gaming.</p>
<p>Excuse me what model Xbox do you have that is so insanely loud as you make it to be? And how did office manage to coem up here where we&#8217;re referring to smartglass and xbox vs Apple Tv? If you&#8217;re sick of your Xbox as a media device don&#8217;t use it as one, you&#8217;re getting a bunch of value-adding services and features for free and complaining? smh</p>
<p>I have an Xbox 360. It&#8217;s loud as shit. Out of every single piece of electronics I own (including my refrigerator), it&#8217;s the loudest by a long shot. Yours isn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>All I&#8217;m saying is that MS isn&#8217;t competing in the same space as the $99 Apple TV is. Nobody goes into a store looking for a $99 ATV and ends up walking out with a $299 Xbox with $5/month XBL subscription. It just doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about gamers. What we&#8217;re not talking about are &#8220;value-adding services and features for free&#8221;. We&#8217;re talking about media distribution and access. For non-gamers, these are the features that they&#8217;re MOST interested in. For non-gamers, these features ARE NOT free.</p>
<p>Excuse me, someone who owns both and uses both every single day, for having an opinion on the matter. Xbox is great for gaming, but without a $99 Lite version, there&#8217;s no way MS will be able to keep non-gamers from buying the ATV instead of it.</p>
<p>I brought up Office as an example of MS not understanding that serivces and software need to be available cross-platform to be successful. I&#8217;d be willing to pay for an Xbox Music subscription if I was able to locally cache it on my iPhone, as I&#8217;m sure a lot of people would be. SMH</p>
<p>You&#8217;re either misinformed or deliberately trolling. Office is available on Mac, PC, Windows Phone and online:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure MS understand how to develop and run cross-platform services. SkyDrive is available on pretty much every device going, too. I imagine Xbox Music is going to be widely supported also &#8211; it&#8217;s in MS&#8217;s best interests to develop the player software for as many OSes as possible.</p>
<p>As for ATV versus Xbox 360, it&#8217;s not a fair or equal comparison, as they are very different devices. Apple&#8217;s box is currently for streaming and that&#8217;s it, whereas the 360 is a games device which also has social and streaming features on top, which are paid for (well, other than BBC iPlayer here in the UK). It&#8217;s not an either/or proposition. I&#8217;d feel stupid recommending my parents buy a 360 just for streaming and playing back music. I do predict, however, that there will be an &#8216;Xbox Lite&#8217; next generation which will be more like a STB with XBLA game support or similar.</p>
<p>I would be completely surprised if they brought Xbox Music to OS X, iOS, Android et al. I definitely welcome it, though. I&#8217;m sick of Rdio right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sitting tight, here. I&#8217;d opt for the true heavyweight Xbox gaming console (hopefully with a large dose of W8 functionality), but a $99 lite version would appeal to pretty much anyone with a TV and smartphone, if pulled off correctly.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve announced it&#8217;s coming</p>
<p>you are the worst troll on this website.</p>
<blockquote> brought up Office as an example of MS not understanding that serivces and software need to be available cross-platform to be successful.</blockquote>
<p>Well then Windows must be the most unsuccessful software MS has, it only runs on Windows :O</p>
<p>oops I just read: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/6/3067350/windows-7-600-million-licenses-sold" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/6/3067350/windows-7-600-million-licenses-sold</a></p>
<blockquote>isn’t going to keep people from buying a new $99 Apple TV</blockquote>
<p>No&#8230; but a $99 Xbox would help. The new ones are quiet and efficient just like you&#8217;re Apple TV. They run 3rd party apps and have games.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick of people ranting about how they use their Xbox without giving any thought to how someone else might. My Xbox is the family media streamer and gaming machine. Hooray for me. Congrats we do different things with it but we both use it. Why the hate?</p>
<p>Apple is going to improve the Apple TV and it will get great for Apple people, but unlike other markets there are strong competitors here that are not stagnant. I expect the disruption to be lower than the Phone and Tablet space they previously conquered.</p>
<p>A $99 Xbox would definitely help. I want one with W8 baked in though, and unfortunately the Xbox 720 will probably retail starting at $399 (quite possibly $499). I&#8217;ll still buy, though.</p>
<p>And enough of this &#8216;Apple people&#8217; talk. TONS of people own devices from 2 or more of the following: Apple, Android, MS.</p>
<p>Excuse me&#8230; people who have multiple Apple devices. The TONS of people who own a diverse collection of devices may be better served with something like SmartGlass that will have apps on the top platforms.</p>
<p>W8 baked in? lol never going to happen. Why would you want that anyway?</p>
<p>then why do yo use the Xbox?</p>
<p>What are you talking about? Your talking like people even know what an Apple TV is!</p>
<p>Apple TV is not even on the radar of most tech geeks.</p>
<p>The Apple TV is only more appealing if you already have an iPad or iPhone otherwise Airplay would be a non option. Besides this has the potential to be big because while Apple TV is cheaper than an Xbox, there are several million more Xbox&#8217;s in the world than Apple TV&#8217;s.</p>
<p>if you own an appletv..like I do&#8230;then you know thats its not an appealing product.  I bought it for airplay only.  Appletv is a crap product with an awful feature set, it is ONLY useful for airplay</p>
<p>i rent HD movies through Apple TV for less than what Comcast charges me.  so on top of AirPlay I am saving money.  i&#8217;m not sure what you thought the Apple TV was going to be for you.  it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s positioned as anything more than AirPlay plus the iTunes app.  however they have the potential to add value via software updates which is rumored to be happening.</p>
<p>I knew exactly what I was getting, airplay and netflix.  It seems like everyone else on this thread thinks that its jesus to your tv</p>
<p>Mostly agreed, but at $99, I think AirPlay is completely worth it.</p>
<p>Wait until iOS 6 gets detailed next week, buddy. I think we&#8217;ll both be really happy with the added features :-)</p>
<p>I guess that&#8217;s where I stand also.  I&#8217;m a fan of apple pushing the market, but not necessarily a fan of apple themselves.</p>
<p>The thing is that if you already own an XBox and ANY tablet or smartphone then you&#8217;re basically covered.  All you&#8217;d need is the smart glass app and you&#8217;re done.  You&#8217;d have to purchase AppleTV on top of having to purchase iPhone/iPad if you didn&#8217;t already own them.  It&#8217;d be nice to think they&#8217;d allow AppleTV to be controlled with other devices but this is Apple, remember?</p>
<p>MS wins this one because they made it available to anyone with the console and a smart device.</p>
<p>As long as that person is willing to pay $60 a year just to enable basic media streaming features.</p>
<p>60.00 a year is the most expensive option, the cards are always discounted and easily found..    One could say upgrading apple tv every couple of years is just, if not more expensive :)</p>
<p>Some 19 million, including myself are.  Well actually I only paid like 34.99 for my 1 year subscription.  There is also the family pack that allows you to add up to 4 accounts, with MS Points allowance and family exclusive content.  That&#8217;s only $25/person/year.</p>
<p>As opposed to free.</p>
<p>If you sold all of your Xbox games and decided you no longer had any interest in gaming (online as well as offline) would you still think it was this great deal?</p>
<p>I bought my parents an Xbox 360 for them to watch Netflix on and hook up to their Windows machine to stream music, and they were NOT happy when they found out there was a monthly fee involved, in addition to the $10/month for Netflix and $50/month for Time Warner.</p>
<p>Well then you failed to get them the appropriate device for their use case.  You should have gotten them a Roku or AppleTV, which does stream music from a Windows machine (iTunes).</p>
<p>I am not a hardcore gamer at all and rarely take advantage of the online multiplayer.  However, I do see value in Xbox Live Gold, not just for the functionality it enables, but also for continued improvement of the (Xbox Live) ecosystem.</p>
<p>I believe many of xbox&#8217;s online services are hosted by MS, hence the gold fee. Worth it to me&#8230;</p>
<p>Dude you&#8217;re a freaking Apple fan and complaining about prices? What on earth?! The $60 comes up to $5 dollars per month, pay it once and you&#8217;re done did done! And you can manage to find it cheaper on Amazon as well for less than 60 OR if you sign up for Bing rewards you can get points to buy it for less as well. C&#8217;mon now.</p>
<p>Plus, there are always deals on the Xbox dashboard itself.  I paid like $35 for my current subscription and my bf got 2 months for $2.  The deals aren&#8217;t that hard to find.</p>
<p>Well by not buying an iOS device and buying a MS or Android device that does the same thing I would probably saved a few years of XBox live subscriptions.</p>
<p>They have different philosophy.  MS always wants to reach the most customers.  Apple wants a closed, tightly controlled ecosystem, where all their hardware works perfectly with one another.  I&#8217;m cheering for both systems, who knows which one i&#8217;ll end up with.  I have an 360 and an iPhone and an android tablet.  Seems the only loser is android.</p>
<p>Xbox is great for gaming, but it&#8217;s a stupid purchase for anyone who doesn&#8217;t game. It&#8217;s just too much money, both up front, as well as monthly. I love the controller, and I don&#8217;t think Apple will be able to come up with anything that compares to the ergonomics and functionality of their physical controller &#8211; and I don&#8217;t doubt that eventually Apple will  offer some sort of Kinect-esque FaceTime Plus feature set though. IDK &#8211; touchscreen and orientation sensor-based gaming really doesn&#8217;t do it for me, though.</p>
<p>I love the competition, but if MS truly wants to compete, they need to match Apple TV&#8217;s $99 price point, and not require a monthly XBL membership just to watch Netflix.</p>
<p>No one who doesn&#8217;t game or doesn&#8217;t have kids will buy an xbox.</p>
<p>My step-mom has not bought a single game for the xbox/kinect bundle she purchased from Target. It came with a year of live and she already had netflix. Plus now, we can video chat with the TV!</p>
<p>not the best or cheapest route to go but more power to her.  kind of like how my Wii ended up, only used to watch netflix on the tv once in a rare while.</p>
<p>My dad did once he saw my system&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote>I love the competition, but if MS truly wants to compete, they need to match Apple TV’s $99 price point, and not require a monthly XBL membership just to watch Netflix.</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; they&#8217;ve been managing to compete so far, including taking a huge bite out of Apple&#8217;s once 90%+ video rental/purchase marketshare, and that&#8217;s with just the Zune marketplace on the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Integrating the service on Windows 8, as well as building on SmartGlass and consistently adding new content partners isn&#8217;t going to hurt their position.</p>
<p>As a side note, as long as FaceTime remains only in the Apple ecosystem, it&#8217;s not really a selling point, because it&#8217;s not ubiquitous, but I don&#8217;t hear you complaining about Apple&#8217;s stance when it comes to cross platform support.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s funny you brought that up, I never even knew apple led in the video rental marketplace, well led until recently being overtaken by netflix.  I doubt apple will make facetime cross platform, they fight hard to close their system and have things work only on apple products.  Seems to be working for them.. so far.</p>
<p>LOL&#8230;First off, who doesn&#8217;t game in the living room on the big HDTV? Secondly, Kinect has sold Xbox 360&#8217;s to millions of people that don&#8217;t really use it for gaming but media instead. Even just comparing the 2 as media boxes&#8230;the Xbox 360 smokes ATV. More apps, better features, Xbox Live integrated and Smartglass just comes back to make sure its good and dead.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so insane that this conversation is even happening! The Apple TV doesn&#8217;t even have any of these project glass features! How in the hell did we get to talking about Apple TV which totally sucks in comparison to the experience you get on a Xbox 360 and doesn&#8217;t have games, kinect, or project glass???</p>
<p>Am I taking crazy pills? :)</p>
<p>I have an XBox, Android Tablet (ICS) an iPhone.<br />
AND an AppleTV, iPad, Macbook Pro, Some generic Gateway laptop, a honeycomb tablet, 2x rokus, a googleTV, a blueray player.</p>
<p>A good chunk is in a classroom. Some is in electronic purgatory (storage) and some is hooked up and used.</p>
<p>Point is, ALL of it got a chance to be the shining center of our universe.</p>
<p>Changing all this has annoyed my wife. My very patient wife.</p>
<p>The AppleTV is nice but SUPER limited and has only ever really been good or worthy for primetime as an Airplay relay.<br />
Hulu Plus works in Mirror mode (limitedly).</p>
<p>The Roku has WAY more content and it doesn&#8217;t CRASH constantly (my Google TV does, grrrr).</p>
<p>Roku is simple, not pretty, not everything works as smoothly as other platforms, but cheap and content.</p>
<p>I just rehooked up my XBox. I do not game.</p>
<p>Amazon works, Hulu Plus (yes I pay for it), netflix, podcasts. A-la-cart via Zune competes with iTunes and Amazon.</p>
<p>Quality is goood, allot of content is stuck in 720p EXCEPT for Zune content (per latest Tekzilla) , but my TV is in 720p anyhow.</p>
<p>AppleTV is relevant, but not king.</p>
<p>Good for you</p>
<p>Not to mention, Apple TV doesn&#8217;t have games, or project glass. As an all in one box, the Apple TV would fail miserably. You simply can&#8217;t get all in one functionality out of it like you could an Xbox 360.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re weak! Please go drink your iflavored kool-aid in a dark room and let us tech agnostic people enjoy all of our modern conveniences. Is Apple paying you or something?</p>
<p>Of course you&#8217;re not into console gaming anymore.  That&#8217;s because Apple doesn&#8217;t make a console.</p>
<p>Your argument is so self-centered it&#8217;s borderline dumb&#8230; You do know that they&#8217;re are more people with Xbox 360&#8217;s than Apple TV&#8217;s do you ?</p>
<p>So maybe this won&#8217;t work for &#8220;You&#8221; but for millions and millions of other people it will do !</p>
<p>Great, so because you&#8217;re not into it.. it means we all aren&#8217;t? This app is free as well. Chekkit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really in to console gaming anymore&#8221; &#8211; Truely disheartening.</p>
<p>Meh to be honest I see the fall of Xbox soon&#8230;it&#8217;s basically turning into Cable TV.</p>
<p>And apart from that, the only reason the 360 succeeded was a late, expensive and un-serious launch for the PS3 and I guess that will change with the PS4</p>
<p>PS3, 360 and Wii owner&#8230;</p>
<p>You can tell yourself these things but the fact is that the XBOX Kinect was the fastest selling consumer electronic device of all time.</p>
<p>fastest shipping&#8230; just saying ;)</p>
<p><a href="http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Kinect-Confirmed-As-Fastest-Selling-Consumer-Electronics-Device/blog/3376939/7691.html" target="_blank">http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Kinect-Confirmed-As-Fastest-Selling-Consumer-Electronics-Device/blog/3376939/7691.html</a></p>
<p>Maybe I missed the joke, but otherwise you&#8217;d be incorrect.</p>
<p>he was incorrect lol</p>
<p>Holiday quarter hilarity. How are they selling now? I can&#8217;t seem to find any sales figures since they broke the CE sales record <strong>with a peripheral</strong>.</p>
<p>and your point? Did the PS move manage to &#8220;move&#8221; that much amount of sale? I think not.</p>
<p>Tell me 3 things you do with your Kinect in a gaming/media-watching session. Be honest.</p>
<p>Well obviously what it&#8217;s advertised to do:<br />
1. Navigating Menus and search via voice<br />
2. Playing Dance Central with the folks<br />
3. Controlling playback and selection of video and music</p>
<p>People buy Xbox with Kinect bundle now. Noone buys Xbox without it anymore</p>
<p>And by the way, how did you like yesterday&#8217;s Microsoft Presentation? lot of Kinect in there&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s part of Xbox now. People use it to control the xbox without a controller. It&#8217;s only going to be more deeply integrated as time goes on</p>
<p>ya i&#8217;m sure thats why year after year the xbox&#8217;s market share has GROWN lol, i mean for the love of god it beat nintendo lol</p>
<p>ultimately xbox&#8217;s success is largely a function of their competitors failing to provide a viable alternative.  i know ps3 owners do like them but their justification for their affection is usually something along the lines of &#8220;it&#8217;s my blueray player&#8221;.  they also use it to watch netflix or vudu or whatever.  nintento&#8217;s wii was a &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; but in retrospect i still do not understand why.  the hype for that one was way more than the actual play value.  ultimately the wii was a kids console which works well if you have small kids but older kids do not enjoy it nearly like they do the games on an xbox.</p>
<p>microsoft does has a nice advantage in the console market.  we&#8217;ll see if smartglass (what a terrible name) does anything to create a desire for their other products (phone/tablet).</p>
<p>i bought an xbox for the games.  if microsoft makes it something more, then that&#8217;s great.  i know there is a desire for a better media center type device in the market.  but i do not see the value proposition for buying an xbox just for smartglass given its cost.</p>
<p>i bought an Apple TV because i already owned 2 ipads and 4 iphones.  for me, it made sense to have the AirPlay functionality for $99.  however i find myself also really appreciating the iTunes app for renting movies.  i have also watched a few Netflix movies on the Apple TV however it&#8217;s becoming clear to me that Netflix is quickly becoming a dead service.  i&#8217;ve seen or have no desire to see the stuff in their collection for months.</p>
<p>&#8230;what about lilyhammer&#8230;.! <strong>sarcasm</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even practical to put all these multimedia functions on an xbox.  You start up the tv the kids pop in a game and just play games anyway.  which is why I moved the xbox to the computer room and put a tv in there.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s a different issue though.  The xbox is intended for the living room.  If all you had was an xbox and you didnt want to by a TV with internet apps and you didnt want to subscribe to cable premium channels and such then having an Xbox and the ability to stream music/videos and stuff is useful.  Not everyone will use an Xbox in this way.. but they are trying to provide reasons to keep adults who are likely to buy more microsoft stuff engaged with their products.</p>
<p>I used to think that too, but the truth is the PS3 is a more hard ore gaming console, but the Xbox just has a better experience. Online gaming is alot better on the Xbox. When U R five playing all your games, the ps3 starts to get useless, untill there&#8217;s another title. But there&#8217;s alot to do on the Xbox. The OS is miles than that of the PS3 multiple signins and all. If not for the awesome games on the ps3, I&#8217;d rather hv only an Xbox. Just saying. Plus its more family friendly. More gamers are becoming family people. Think about that.</p>
<p>How is the PS3 a more &#8220;hard ore&#8221; gaming console? I hate when people say shit like that. All three consoles have plenty of things to appeal to everyone. There are no specific examples on any of the consoles that make me think: &quot;Oh, man, that is way more &#8220;hardcore&#8221; than any of the options on [competing platform]. I love being a &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gamer and only having to worry about one truly &#8220;hardcore&#8221; platform.&quot;</p>
<p>There are kick-ass exclusives on all three consoles. There are kick-ass exclusives on all of the mobile phones and handhelds. There are kick-ass exclusives on PCs and Macs.</p>
<p>A hardcore gamer enjoys every platform because they all have advantages and exclusive games you won&#8217;t find anywhere else. Stop worrying about the console and start enjoying the games.</p>
<p>PS3: better graphics, caching to HDD, Blueray, apps<br />
XBox: Media Center Integration (matters to me), Zune Marketplace, apps for media.</p>
<p>I left allot out. MEANING: what do you use it for?<br />
For me, the lower price point (NOT bundling, just bare minimal) and built in media friendly prposes, XBox wins for me.</p>
<p>Correct!! You just said right!</p>
<p>I understand what you are saying, (sorry about the typos tho, phone keyboard and autocorrect), I play both consoles but the PS3 has more games that look and play hardcore, I only play Halo and gears on my Xbox. I have the bulk of my games on my PS3, but what I found out resently is after I&#8217;m done with the campaigns, I find myself using the Xbox for other stuff than the PS3, the thing just sits there packing dust, and internet in my country is SHIT!! but the Xbox&#8217;s online experience doesnt feel so laggy, Vevo for example works fine, and I couldn&#8217;t even watch The Tester in SD without major lag, I ended up wating the whole season on YouTube.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t touched my PS3. All multiplatform games are automatically Xbox for me. I&#8217;ve finished playing Uncharted. Thinking of selling my ps3</p>
<p>I am not even a hardcore gamer, but Playstation has always seemed to be more hardcore than the other consoles, while Nintendo was more casual and family friendly, with the Xbox now covering the middle ground.</p>
<p>cable TV @ $60 a year sounds pretty good to me&#8230;</p>
<p>My experience has been the exact opposite. My wife watches all of her TV on the Xbox. I use Last.fm and also watch all my TV on the Xbox. We also rent movies on the Xbox from time to time as it&#8217;s got the best selection and interface of any of the other boxes. Picture quality is excellent. I also game on the xbox (of course).</p>
<p>So what you see as the Xbox undoing is in reality what has made it so popular. And Microsoft looks like it&#8217;s finally figuring out how to unite all of it&#8217;s platforms in a compelling way.</p>
<p>The Xbox will fall because there&#8217;s a new one coming out.</p>
<p>Apple has never really been big when it comes to living room entertainment. Apple TV hasn&#8217;t sold nearly as many units as XBox and doesn&#8217;t have anywhere near the kind of features XBox has now.</p>
<p>They also don&#8217;t have a music subscription service yet. Needless to say by the end of the year Microsoft will have more than enough devices to cover the gaps now including servers.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say Apple is way ahead.</p>
<p>true story</p>
<blockquote>Apple TV hasn’t sold nearly as many units as XBox and doesn’t have anywhere near the kind of features XBox has now.</blockquote>
<p>Other than video games what are these features?</p>
<blockquote>They also don’t have a music subscription service yet.</blockquote>
<p>They have Rdio, Soptify, Mog, etc. What is the special need for a music subscriptions when most don&#8217;t want it?</p>
<p>Other than video games, here are some features:</p>
<p>AppleTV &#8211; iTunes, Netflix, YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr, MLB.tv, NBA, NHL, WSJ Live</p>
<p>Xbox &#8211; Amazon Instant Video, CinemaNow, Crackle, Dailymotion, EPIX, ESPN, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, IGN, iHeartRadio, Last.fm, Manga Entertainment, MLB.tv, MSN with MSNBC, MUZU.tv, Netflix, Syfy, TMZ, NBC Today, UFC, Verizon FiOS TV, VEVO, VUDU, XFINITY On Demand, YouTube, Zune</p>
<p>That&#8217;s US centric, for people like us Brits, Xbox gives us &#8211; BBC iPlayer, Sky, 4oD, LoveFilm, Demand 5, where as AppleTV gives us&#8230;. nothing.</p>
<p>In other words AppleTV doesn&#8217;t have nearly as many features and lacks games all together! Also&#8230; I don&#8217;t see Rdio, Spotify, Mog etc. working on AppleTV. So the only one that provides a subscription music service between the two, is Xbox.</p>
<p>Spotify works just fine via AirPlay, thanks. And if that&#8217;s not your thing, you have a choice of Pandora, Rdio, Mog, etc.</p>
<p>Using the features of an iDevice to claim the AppleTV by association has them is flawed. The AppleTV <strong>cannot</strong> stream music from Spotify by itself. The Xbox doesn&#8217;t need a Windows Phone to stream music from Zune.</p>
<p>And that why I don&#8217;t under stand the xbox/MS hate here.  The E3 announcement basically shows the apps themselves inter-working with one another seamlessly but also works independently.  That&#8217;s pretty damn cool and something this section of the industry can benefit from.</p>
<p>WTF? That&#8217;s called a hack. Do you want a list of hacks we can do? DOn&#8217;t go there man</p>
<p>How&#8217;s HBO GO working out for you over AirPlay? Oh yeah, I forgot. It&#8217;s blocked.</p>
<p>You need to pay an additional $199 to $500 to get that option lol</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget Kinect with the voice/gesture commands.  That&#8217;s huge as we use it all the time.  Also this fall XBox will have an internet browser that can be controlled with smart glass. :D</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that any app that plays video or audio on your iDuvice can stream it to the AppleTV, so it does have most to apps you listed for the box, and more! Plus you don&#8217;t have to pay a yearly fee just to access them.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true you don&#8217;t pay a yearly fee, you just have to own purchase 2 devices as neither the iDevice nor the AppleTV can single-handedly do what the Xbox does&#8230; ie play all this content on your big screen TV.</p>
<p>AHHHHH, FACTS! They burn the apple fanboy eyes!</p>
<p>What are these features. Games. Other than games?<br />
Hulu Plus, IHeartRadio. Amazon VoD</p>
<p>Downloadable content, better UI (imo).<br />
Higher price point is bad, but the content trumps the aTV</p>
<p>AppleTV has far more content when paired with an iDevice, plus you don&#8217;t have to pay the stupid MS tax just to see it.</p>
<p>So instead, I have to pay 10 years worth of &#8220;MS tax&#8221; to own an iDevice. I don&#8217;t see why you keep bringing up that comparison.</p>
<p>But you have to buy a mobile device to use these smart glass features anyway.Plus the membership fee, which noone else charges.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s cause their memberships suck balls.</p>
<p>@Robotic<br />
 Strawman!<br />
Sorry that you are one of the lonely americans who can&#8217;t afford to pay a service worth paying for.  Money makes the world turn, it&#8217;s a simple fact.  In order to receive more content and feedback from a provider, they must first see some cash flow.  $60 dollars a year should be chump change to anyone that makes over $12 an hour, and thats just for people who have to pay cable, internet, phone etc. and want XBL as a convenience. Under $12/hour work can use xbox as a necessity ;) Or Apple TV if that is what floats your boat.<br />
But I believe in paying for my services.  Because I understand how the world work.  And your repetitive comments makes me think that you are the same type of person who complains about price differences between grocers (Raleys and Bel Aire VS WalMart).  Their are trade offs to every win.  And If I owned  a PS3 I would probably have PS+ service or whatever it is, just because I&#8217;d rather be a preferred guest, instead of a just another customer.</p>
<p>Whats your goal in life? get bit by a dog to receive an $80 thousand settlement and coast off that for a while? get Real.  Having to pay is not as big of a deal as you make it out to be</p>
<p>Just reread my post and made it seem as if I am not american, and that if you were, in fact, american.</p>
<p>Well to clear things up, I am an American and I do not know if you are/are not.  haha (:</p>
<p>However, the song remains the same</p>
<p>This guy gets it.  Agree 100%</p>
<p>But you pay a HUGE apple tax without any complaints.</p>
<p>Note: See last quarter&#8217;s profits.</p>
<p>Apple tv&#8230;oh you mean steve jobs&#8217; hobby thing? Stop being dilusional, you know that there are about 10x as many 360s in the wild as apple tvs. Roughly 70 million 360s vs around 7 million apple tvs.</p>
<p>But anyways apple troll aside, i hope there is some type of cheaper option than using a 360 to accomplish TV streaming. I have my ps3, and i don&#8217;t think i&#8217;d switch over to a 360 just to get this this. And definitely don&#8217;t think i&#8217;d be a dual console owner.</p>
<p>Has jobs ever even mentioned apple tv in any of his presentations? Seems like no one really pushes it.</p>
<p>Past tense, he&#8217;s no longer with us.</p>
<p>But the thing gets yearly refresh updates and is mentioned during keynote presentations&#8230;it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s some secret project. I think I heard between this year and last sales during the 1st quarter of apple tvs doubled.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t know about you but i&#8217;d rather have MS Xbox360 as a install base than a Apple TV customers as install base why? because i dont know its 10x as large lol&#8230;</p>
<p>I mean honestly the appletv is nice but its not exactly everywhere in fact i currently have 0 friends that have one. I actually know more people with boxee boxes than appletv&#8217;s lol &#8230;.</p>
<p>That said the fact that apple has iphones and ipads is moot since smartglass will work on both, AS WELL AS ANDROID, which makes it the more spread out platform than apple can hope for.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t entirely understand the &#8220;10x as large&#8221; part of your argument.</p>
<p>for playing games via xbox live that number matters but for the media center elements of xbox vs apple tv or any other product in that segment it really does not matter how many other people have them does it?</p>
<p>apple is selling a ridiculous number of iphones (something like 377,000 a day).  if you &#8220;numbers&#8221; count, then there are more idevices out there then xbox&#8217;s hands down.  in my mind the main selling point of the apple tv is to give idevice owners an option to sling their idevice content to their tv if they want it.  apple would have to give it more apps for it to stand alone without an idevice and still be worth the $99.</p>
<p>If we play that game then windows 8 beats all the idevices combined&#8230;.</p>
<p>soon every one of those will be smartglass devices (along with the android/ios devices).</p>
<p>The 10x part refers to xbox to apple tv (the device required for both to get on the tv).</p>
<p>meant windows but soon to be windows 8&#8230;</p>
<p>unfortunately for microsoft, there are more ipad&#8217;s being sold now than there are pc&#8217;s.  so while it may be true that there are more pc&#8217;s than idevices in the world right now, it is quite possible that we are in a post pc era and the pc will quickly fade as households choose to get tablets instead of putting money into a pc.  this is why microsoft is making windows 8 so tablet centric by the way.  the pc is diminishing as a market and they know they are late to the tablet market.  i completely understand the need for microsoft to connect with consumers.  they need to make an ecosystem where people who have windows phones and windows tablets can get extra value with an xbox like device in their living room.</p>
<p>&#8220;here are more ipad’s being sold now than there are pc’s&#8221; That&#8217;s incorrect, the sold more iPads than any one PC manufacturer indivdually. A HUGE differnce. And apparently that didn&#8217;t include notebooks which everyone is selling more of by the month. These figures were btw provided by Apple themselve so I have my doubts if they&#8217;re correct. But even if you take Apple by they&#8217;re word at least quote them correctly.</p>
<p>Oh my, sorry for all the horrible typos (they&#8217;re=their and so on), here&#8217;s what they said: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/07/apple-sold-more-ipads-in-q4-than-any-single-pc-manufacturer/" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/07/apple-sold-more-ipads-in-q4-than-any-single-pc-manufacturer/</a></p>
<p>I stand corrected.  However even if we&#8217;re not their right now we are on a trajectory to get there fairly soon.  The point was that the writing is on the wall.  Is that deniable?  I probably should have worded it as tablet vs desktop pc sales instead of iPad vs PC&#8217;s strictly.  While the iPad is the dominant player, it isn&#8217;t the only one.  If you are to believe the speculators, tablets will overtake desktop pc sales by 2013 with netbook/notebook sales staying about what they are  (source: <a href="http://www.surfmobee.com/?p=1046" target="_blank">http://www.surfmobee.com/?p=1046</a>).  Microsoft needs to have a better offering for people who will have tablets and portable computers.</p>
<p>Yet by the time that happens (if that happens) Windows 8 on tablets will already a staple.</p>
<p>My beef with this constant &#8220;But Apple does&#8230;&#8221; crap is that its completely ignoring the GAMING APPLICATIONS Smart Glass includes.  I mean, did you just watch the segment w/ the Game of Thrones episode and then turn it off?  Did you not see the Madden and Halo concept videos?  Or the IE integration?</p>
<p>Apple &#8216;can do all of that&#8217; for the non-gaming crowd.  Good, great.<br />
For people who like to play Xbox Games&#8230; Apple can eat a dick.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder if it is a challenge to, aping of, or just natural evolution of where platforms for media are going as a whole. The Wii U tablet thing is supposedly somewhat like this but Smartglass uses what people likely already have. Smart devices. From a tablet (platform agnostic) to a TV and Wifi (ubiquitous) this is becoming (really already is) the current N.American household scenario.</p>
<p>Apple is too rigid. Open, platform. Not 2 words used TOGETHER with Apple.</p>
<p>Content is not vibrant or rich on AppleTV YET. Who knows, maybe they will suprise us in the next 2 years. You know, like smexy hardware with &#8230; Amazing content? Nah, and I own apple products. But for content? Psh</p>
<p>Xbox is far more closed than apple TV.</p>
<p>How so?  I would say their on equal footing.</p>
<p>ack, they are on** sorry</p>
<p>i&#8217;m not entirely enthralled by the whole &#8220;movie extras&#8221; piece of the smartglass app.  i never buy dvd or blue ray movies because of the extras either.  i know some people like that stuff and it&#8217;s one of those things people thought would be wildly popular with consumers but it wasn&#8217;t.  so i don&#8217;t understand how it&#8217;s a real selling point with smartglass.  i do think that giving an extra heads up display for games you are playing on the xbox is smart though.  that will ad value for xbox gamers for certain.  however i will not go out of my way to buy a smartglass device just to see the faces of actors in a movie scene.  that&#8217;s just not important to me.</p>
<p>if you have an ipad (3rd gen) and an apple tv there are some pretty sweet games out there that let you play on the tv and turns your ipad into a really sweet controller.  games on the ipad (3rd gen) can be very impressive too and if you have an ipad you can take that whereever you go unlike an xbox 360.  :D</p>
<p>I think the capability of a better controller is one aspect of this too&#8230;.  where in a video you can see the entire UI to quickly switch to other content w/o having to pull up a guide or exit the video&#8230;</p>
<p>think espn for example where you can be in a game but still have the ui on your device to quickly swap between games.</p>
<p>Since you apparently know the future could you recommend some stocks to buy? Oh and while you&#8217;re at it, who&#8217;s gonna win the Stanley Cup?</p>
<p>I love it when Apple fanboys say Xbox is all they have.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re thinking of it the wrong way. The Xbox has the living room and its ability to interface with devices is cross platform.</p>
<p>so your ipad and iphone (or Android or WP) will run your xbox re: music, movies, television, gaming, and social networking.</p>
<p>the xbox has a user install base in the living room that apple does not. This app requires in theory (as long as they make it backward compatible to the current gen xbox) no additional cost other than downloading an application onto your device. so it costs nothing to take a peek.</p>
<p>and what microsoft gets about the living room is what apple does NOT. The living room is family space &#8211; you&#8217;re not just dealing with hipsters living in studios in williamsburg. The point is that children have a say into the kind of box that goes into the living room. So a family wants to get one box? the kids (and maybe dad) want games &#8211; the xbox is the easy choice over an apple tv (as well as over the playstation or the Wii).</p>
<blockquote>you’re not just dealing with hipsters living in studios in williamsburg</blockquote>
<p>I lol&#8217;ed&#8230;that section of the J is dead to me&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple has failed in the living room just like they failed in the office just like they failed on the internet just like they&#8217;re going to fail in automotive, get over it kiddo. Apple succeeded in mobile, that&#8217;s it; don&#8217;t overstate their success rate.</p>
<p>Well, to be fair, Apple has leveraged where they have succeeded to places where they have failed quite masterfully.  iPads in the business world have some purpose in current computing (i am careful with how i choose my words) and they have a purpose in the classroom/lecture hall.</p>
<p>Yep because you build one of the largest corporations in the world through constant product failures. Right.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m pretty sure they are more xbox 360s in living rooms RIGHT NOW than apple tv.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t make any sense. There are far more xbox 360&#8217;s in homes around the world than apple tv&#8217;s. Apple has a world of catching up to do and is far behind the competition.</p>
<p>Except Apple doesn&#8217;t REALLY have the Apple TV in place. There are FAR MORE XBoxes in the world than ATVs.</p>
<p>Microsoft also has something called Windows. Maybe you&#8217;ve heard of it.</p>
<p>Look at the sales for the xbox 360 compared to the apple tv. Now throw in that smartglass aims to be cross platform. Regardless of features you may promote for a platform that does not exist yet, Microsoft has the advantage here, on top of being the first to bring it to market.</p>
<p>You have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.  I only say this because you posted the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah I think so, Apple will be the leader in this kind of thing so it’s very relevant. THey already have everything in place, iPhones, iPads and Apple TV.<br />
 <br />
Microsoft just has the xbox right now, the phone aren’t selling and the tablets aren’t even out there yet really. Apple are way ahead is this area right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple isn&#8217;t the leader right now.  Apple TV is a joke and doesn&#8217;t sell.  Windows Phones ARE selling (or have you not been reading all the headlines and reading stat trackers on places like Amazon and Wal Mart the past few months?).  Microsoft has Windows, which is responsible for 90%+ of the operating systems running in the world.  Microsoft has the Xbox 360 which is near 70 million units sold.  Microsoft has the best tablet OS which is receiving its polishing right now (the release preview is incredible and takes a massive dump on iOS and everything it can&#8217;t do in comparison).</p>
<p>To say Apple is &#8220;way ahead&#8221; is ignorance and shows your lack of research/knowledge into the situation.  While working for Apple I came to realize their products didn&#8217;t work as well together as everyone thought they would.  iCloud isn&#8217;t all that great (and it&#8217;s even run by Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud service), mobile products are starting to receive negative criticism, Macs are severely overpriced, and other companies are simply building better products.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s SmartGlass  goes way beyond anything Apple is doing.  The content available via the SmartGlass/Xbox/Windows platforms is mammoth when compared to Apple TV (or any other multimedia streaming service/hardware).  They&#8217;re adding another 35 pieces of content throughout the next year for crying out loud!  And live ESPN/ESPN2/ESPN3/ESPNU with on-demand games and Monday Night Football?  Get out dude.  Apple&#8217;s already lost.</p>
<p>Oh, and Microsoft is supporting all their devices AND iOS and Android devices.  If that&#8217;s not incredible I don&#8217;t know what is.  Microsoft is saying &#8220;we&#8217;ll support our competition&#8221;, because in the end Microsoft wins.  And all this stuff runs on hardware you already own.  You don&#8217;t have to buy new products (like Apple will make you do).  This was the big claim Microsoft made on stage while doing the demo of the tech.  I&#8217;m stoked for this.  Microsoft is making Win 8 even greater with all this tech available @ the new OS launch.</p>
<p>Oh my, another poor soul with his mind taken over. You&#8217;re like that mattkicksass guy.</p>
<p>Really didn&#8217;t realize that Apple TV can replace a cable box by interacting with a Cable Card enabled PC.  I&#8217;ll make sure that I check into it.  Not to mention there are so many more XBox devices actually in Living Rooms in comparison to Apple TV.</p>
<p>In my opinion Apple TV is way behind Microsoft.</p>
<p>The numbers don&#8217;t support that &#8220;Apple are way ahead&#8221;?  Over 70 million Xboxes in market, 40 million Xbox Live subscribers, likely at least 200 million windows 8 licenses in the next 2 years. Check out this NYT article describing how Microsoft is way ahead in this space despite its phone woes; moreover, MS has demonstrated they are more than willing to put apps on competing mobile platforms, something Apple rarely if ever does for iOS stuff. <a href="http://nyti.ms/KtcOto" target="_blank">http://nyti.ms/KtcOto</a></p>
<p>Neither is Apple TV selling&#8230;</p>
<p>Um. AirPlay?  By the way&#8230; haven&#8217;t we heard from Microsoft Employees for years that Windows already has &#8216;AirPlay&#8217; via DLNA? So why is THIS newsworthy?</p>
<p>Who knows, but apparently they&#8217;re doing something bold. Like connecting my laptop to my TV set without wires. Or something.</p>
<p>No I&#8217;m just kidding. The reason this might be interesting is because you won&#8217;t be tied to Apple&#8217;s Wall Garden, of course. You know.. the walled garden that ONLY includes the most popular devices on Earth? The iPhone, iPod and iPad? I mean.. pfft&#8230; who even owns one of those, right?</p>
<ul>
	<li>a billion hands go up</li>
</ul>
<p>Right, exactly, it&#8217;s Apple again with their ivory town nonsense again&#8230; finally Zune owners&#8230;   Ah&#8230; HP tablets&#8230; urm&#8230;  Big Ass Tables&#8230;..</p>
<p>*crickets</p>
<p>Fine, we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see, shall we?</p>
<p>Did you miss the part where this works on all those iOS devices you mentioned, plus Android and Windows.</p>
<p>Yeah, you conveniently ignored that didn&#8217;t you.</p>
<p>I would root for MS though becauseAirplay isn&#8217;t good as a living room media streaming solution since Apple TV&#8217;s aren&#8217;t popular and you need iDevices. The Xbox will sell 70 million units by the time this thing launches, Smart Glass works acroos many platforms and Xbox users tend to consume media heavily according to MS.</p>
<p>DLNA &gt; AirPlay why? Its cross vendor specific standard, meanwhile airplay while nice is just DLNA with a pretty apple frontend.</p>
<p>except this works on IOS, and the issue isn&#8217;t the controller penetration its the controlled penetration and Xbox360 = WAYYYYYY higher penetration than any appletv lol</p>
<p>Airplay functions, DLNA sometimes does not.<br />
In an environment of media, it &#8220;just working&#8221; is amazing.</p>
<p>I am hands down a fan of PLEX for the purposes of things functioning. Buy what you want, config on ONE server. Have it work with everything you own. Some needs rooting (jailbreaking) but meh.</p>
<p>This happens in every article about something good that isn&#8217;t made by Apple.</p>
<p>But you need an Apple TV in the first place. I&#8217;m pretty sure more people have an Xbox 360 than an Apple TV. I am now going to speculate that by winter alot of people will own a tablet in either OS. That this tablet will then run smart glass.</p>
<p>Half the job is already complete and MS is expecting them to either buy a Windows 8 device or any tablet, or just use their current smart phone with the Smart Glass app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready for it, I have thre 360s and Windows Phone,  my family have a mix of ios and android devices and we are an established install base.</p>
<p>However I won&#8217;t use it since, I&#8217;ve used the companion app on both win 8 and win phone and just never bothered with it again. But to others that don&#8217;t want to use the controller they pretty much are already established installbase.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the fee for Xbox live Gold. How many people are going to want to pay $60 a year just to get Netflix to talk to the Internet?</p>
<p>At least 16  Million People, twice the Apple TV userbase</p>
<p>(Calculation based on that Xbox Live have at least billion dollar in revenue (2010) at Xbox Live cost 60 buck a year)</p>
<p>Microsoft has an existing user base.  The question is how many people will they add to that user base with the products and services they announced yesterday?  I think the steep yearly subscription for an Xbox Live membership is a barrier to entry for many people.</p>
<p>More people own iDevices than own an Xbox 360.  Does it really matter how many people own Apple TV devices?  I don&#8217;t think it does frankly.  Apple isn&#8217;t targetting Xbox owners with the Apple TV.  Nor is anything on the Apple TV part of a social network of some kind.</p>
<p>The SmartGlass app on iDevice and android will more than likely just be a remote control type thing and not likely to work for video/audio streaming like it will on a microsoft OS device.  From what I have read, Microsoft isn&#8217;t confirming what will work on iDevice and androids.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don’t forget the fee for Xbox live Gold. How many people are going to want to pay $60 a year just to get Netflix to talk to the Internet?&#8221;</p>
<p>I do, and so do the tens of millions of other people.  And don&#8217;t say to get Netflix on.  That&#8217;s what a total moron would say, and I don&#8217;t want to assume you are one.  HBO Go, Hulu Plus, ESPN/ESPN2/ESPNU (adding this year), ESPN3, MLBTV, Crackle, Xfinity, FIOS, Facebook, Twitter, Zune Marketplace (soon to be Windows Marketplace or whatever the branding is being folded in to), Amazon Video, Fox (to be released soon), iHeart Radio, Last.FM, Manga, and another 100 that weren&#8217;t highlighted during the press briefing yesterday (I heard Disney was one of them).</p>
<p>Seriously&#8230; $60 is definitely worth it.  In a perfect world where nobody got paid for the work they did, and it didn&#8217;t cost anything to host the content &amp; stream it, this would be paid.  Sony doesn&#8217;t host anything, doesn&#8217;t lock in exclusivity, and doesn&#8217;t invest heavily into security.  But you get a free service&#8230; too bad it takes over 3 times as long to download the same content.  Then there&#8217;s the whole &#8220;Xbox hosts demos for nearly every game ever released&#8221; part, because they host the game demos.  Sony makes developers/production studios host them on their own, which leads to a ton of studios not offering demos because of the costs to host and maintain servers for uploading.</p>
<p><b>this would be FREE (not paid as I accidentally typed in my response)</b></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get some numbers in there for ya&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/60687-xbox-live-users-topple-40-million" target="_blank">http://www.tgdaily.com/games-and-entertainment-brief/60687-xbox-live-users-topple-40-million</a></p>
<p>Granted that&#8217;s activated, not up kept, and the number was reported by Microsoft. But still. Obviously there are plenty of people who are going to pay $60 a year &#8220;just to get Netflix to talk to the internet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kinect users/owners are actually 2/3 of the total Xbox 360s sold.  That article isn&#8217;t accurate in that spot.  I couldn&#8217;t recall the exact number of Xbox Live users there are, but it&#8217;s a majority of 360 owners.  Live is essential unless you&#8217;re unable to play games online (or aren&#8217;t buying games with online capabilities).  I can&#8217;t imagine using any other console anymore.  Nintendo is dying out (sadly) and Sony isn&#8217;t doing a lot to keep up (that paid subscription service for a big game catalog is cool, but that&#8217;s the first thing I&#8217;ve found ambitious by Sony in years).</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need an Xbox to use it&#8221; &#8211; but you&#8217;ll need an Apple TV.</p>
<p>But you will need a phone or a tablet right? Don&#8217;t think Micrsoft are doing very well in these areas right now and are WAY behind Apple.</p>
<p>No you&#8217;ll need an iOS, Android, or Windows Phone device to use it.</p>
<p>but with an xbox right?</p>
<p>65 Million Xbox 360&#8217;s world wide&#8230;</p>
<p>And as Tom said Smart Glass will be Multi-Platform not just WinPho&#8230;</p>
<p>But wait, 2million apple tv&#8217;s sold lastyear.</p>
<p>Apple are onto a winner.</p>
<p>right. xbox and any tablet or phone..</p>
<p>but with an Apple TV right?</p>
<p>65M XBoxes vs 5M Apple TVs</p>
<p>too bad it doesnt matter how well microsoft does in the tablet / phone market since it works on all of them&#8230;</p>
<p>That said from the recent numbers, microsoft is gaining traction in Asia and EU with WP.</p>
<p>That combined with an AMAZING showing this year with some crazy good tablets with windows 8, and with windows phone 8 coming, don&#8217;t be counting microsoft out.</p>
<p>Sorry, how can I use this without an xbox? With my iPhone?</p>
<p>airplay!</p>
<p>So how will the games work without and xbox?</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/131/351/eb6.jpg?1307463786" /></p>
<p>lol no I&#8217;m serious. I don&#8217;t really see the gaming thing working that well in single player mode (with a friend maybe) because you will have to switch between controller and device and I&#8217;m not going to buy a &#8220;Games Console&#8221; just to get &#8220;extras&#8221; on my iPhone and iPad. If you already have an xbox great :)</p>
<p>1st its not only a game console any more. its more like an entertainment center. second &#8211; not possible with apple tv.<br />
third: more xboxes out there than apple tvs.<br />
fourth: you need an xbox and you can use ANY other devices then (tv, phone tablet) &#8211; compare that to apple. You need all the iDevices and you&#8217;re stuck in their ecosystem.</p>
<p>I rather buy an xbox for a couple of hundreds instead of the whole iWorld for like $5000&#8230;.</p>
<p>Fair points in a way but 65m sold on the fact it&#8217;s a &#8220;games console&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure they could sell a $400 &#8220;entertainment Center&#8221; anymore, APple TV $99.</p>
<p>Apple TV has been a &#8220;Hobby&#8221; that Apple hasn&#8217;t pushed at all YET. If they told the right &#8220;Story&#8221; I think they could sell one to most iPhone/iPad users, Thats a lot of Apple TV&#8217;s sold, a lot&#8230;</p>
<p>I get the walled Garden thing but it hasn&#8217;t put many people off so far I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s 250€ here&#8230; much less than 400$</p>
<p>it hasnt? So what are the markshare numbers from Windiws vs OSx Devices again?</p>
<p>It may be relevant to bring up Microsoft&#8217;s idea to sell the 360 for $99 with a 2-year Gold subscription.</p>
<p>Say what you will about the subscription costs themselves, but it seems like a deal.</p>
<p>The subscription costs are ridiculous. Why do you have to pay a yearly fee to MS in order to stream Netflix?</p>
<p>you&#8217;re playing a subscription fee to MS to play games on a platform that happens to have Netflix.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to. You don&#8217;t have to buy an xbox this way (or even at all). This is the same idea as buying an unlocked phone vs a phone with a contract</p>
<p>a lot of people in the market for a smart TV/entertainment center, would also want a games console. in that the Xbox has an edge.</p>
<p>if you have apple products, and don&#8217;t want a games console, then sure, the Apple TV might be better.</p>
<p>people are just saying that Xbox has a market penetration and that SmartGlass is cross-devices vs Apple&#8217;s walled garden.</p>
<p>Pretty sure you can buy a brand new xbox 360 for 199 dollars.</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve bought an xbox 3 years ago because of some xbox-exclusive games and because i didn&#8217;t want to invest too much into pc hardware.. but since then i use it very occasionally for gaming.. usually to play some racing with my brother.<br />
but still, it&#8217;s turned on most of the time because i stream the music from my computer to play it on the audio system. and i play youtube videos on it. so it&#8217;s not a gaming console for me anymore :)</p>
<p>So would you pay $400 for that now?</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve already bought the second new black one because i&#8217;ve broken the old one when trying to open and crack it :D and it was 250€</p>
<p>And you feeling that&#8217;s a good price for essentially a streaming content box? Also, the new xbox will not come to market at $250</p>
<p>oh my god its not ONLY for one thing&#8230; whats the matter with you</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not just a streaming box-even if i use it like that currently..<br />
if you need a streaming box and already own apple devices, buy apple tv and use airplay.. i personally don&#8217;t like iphone and ipad, so apple tv is not an option for me.. but i&#8217;m quite sure you&#8217;d go ok with it</p>
<p>Totally agree. It&#8217;s about choice. This is great if you already have an xbox, totally great. I just think that looking forward it&#8217;s going to be an expensive option for most people. Of course the answer is for Microsoft to release an &#8220;xbox&#8221; without the games console ;)</p>
<p>Well, for comparison, the Apple TV solution is still more expensive and more limited, requiring a specific, $500-$600 (without subsidies) Apple iOS device. By the way, funny how you claim people will need to buy an Xbox, but you seem to assume everyone has an iPhone.</p>
<p>Anyway, in comparison, Microsoft offers a solution that works with 70 million Xboxes and 300 million mobile devices (even the Apple ones) already in consumers hands. So this is great for a lot more people than Apple TV. And unlike Apple TV, this one does games, too! Hell, it even plays DVD&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Actually, i&#8217;m sorry. You got your Apple TV, invested a lot of money in your iOS setup, and you want to believe it&#8217;s the best thing you&#8217;ve ever done. And here is Microsoft pissing in your walled garden. That has to hurt. My sympathies, tecnology is a bitch, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>I think the smart glass solution seems pretty good but all my points are really looking at the bigger picture further down the line.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t really see the gaming smart glass experience being that good on the Xbox and I think Apple are in a much stronger position for the video/music offerings at this stage.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you tell us why is Apple in stronger position for the video/music offerings at this stage?? Can&#8217;t figure it out eh??</p>
<p>if you STILL &#8211; after so many facts against you &#8211; can&#8217;t see the big picture you should put down those big two <strike>tomatos </strike>apples from your eyes and start looking man.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s great that you have an opinion, you seem to be repeating yourself all the way down this thread. Why not just make your point and leave it at that. To paraphrase, you don&#8217;t think smart glass is good (mostly, it seems, because it&#8217;s not AppleTV). Fine. We get it. At this point, though, MS seem more likely to be competing with WiiU &amp; PS3 than AppleTV.</p>
<p>Smart Glass is a platform for other content providers to build on and as such it seems (to some of us) a pretty good idea. It may take off, it may not. I hope it does because I&#8217;d like to see what the content providers can offer.</p>
<p>You sir, are the best counter-troll ever.. You got him right in the *ss..</p>
<p>xD exactly my thought! Well done!</p>
<p>I bet that if apple tv will have some crazy upgrade and have Kinect like features, then the price will go up as well, the fact is apple tv is cheap now cuz its crap&#8230; if they change it completely its not hard to imagine they will also change the name and the price.</p>
<p>Not to mention the yearly just to use basic media features.</p>
<p>A what now?</p>
<p>dude you can search for reasons why apple is better all day long man, apparently we all think xbox+win8 is the better choice and most consumers will too in 2013.</p>
<p>If I thought the xbox route was a better choice for me I&#8217;d happily walk the path, I just can&#8217;t see it if you look at all the factors.</p>
<p>k, thx. bye</p>
<p>And what would those &#8220;factors&#8221; be?</p>
<p>Because from this discussion, it looks like the only problem you have with the Xbox route has is that it works with devices without an Apple logo&#8230;</p>
<p>Yearly subscription fee just to use basic media features is silly..</p>
<p>Dude he&#8217;s obviously too creative to have anything to do with anything that&#8217;s not Apple. He&#8217;s a barista.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ve approached this the wrong way. Xbox Smartscreen is an additional feature to the Xbox. Its not the sole feature enticing you to buy the Xbox. Its main competitors are more like the PS3 and WiiU in the terms of giving gamers (casual or hardcore) a whole entertainment experience. Apple TV and the Xbox are two totally different products and while some services overlap,  they aren&#8217;t going for the same markets. Especially when Microsoft are trying to tie the xbox service to windows 8 and windows phone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that there wasn&#8217;t a article explaining this feature attached to the comment section!  That might have cleared everything up.</p>
<p>OH! Look above the comments, a long explanation with video explaining that this works with an Xbox and any Windows, Android, or iOS device.</p>
<p>Its an Xbox feature.  Are you just trolling?  OMG HOW CAN I USE SIRI ON MY WINDOWS 8 TABLET!@!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Wow, it will do it all without an Xbox to use it.</p>
<p>Magical.</p>
<p>Now, if they could do it without the particularly useless appletv, then it might be good.</p>
<p>Useless = Anything that requires a credit card&#8230;</p>
<p>Gotcha</p>
<p>No&#8230; useless anything that 1) has little content outside of USA, and  2) charges too much for said content.</p>
<p>Zune movie store is also particularly useless.  But hey, it still does more than an AppleTV.</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;d need an Apple TV and an iPhone or iPad to take advantage of it.<br />
I don&#8217;t own or intend to buy any of those products so clearly Microsoft&#8217;s offering is superior for me.<br />
The way you phrase it, you seem to think what you&#8217;ve said is &#8220;better&#8221; when in fact it&#8217;s just different.</p>
<p>Apple TV and airplay are limit just like facetime and imessage to only apple&#8217;s products &#8212;  have to buy a $400 ipad or a $200 iphone or ipod and then you still have to spend a $100+ on an apple TV.  At Least with smartglass it&#8217;s BYOD, if you have an xbox.</p>
<p>So what you have to sya now?</p>
<p>You have to spend $60 a year on the Xbox just to keep the media features working.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re stupid, yes. But hey, maybe you can keep posting that to everyone&#8217;s comments on this post and maybe we&#8217;ll get your anti-MSFT message.</p>
<p>Having to pay anything to connect Netflix to the internet is a ripoff.</p>
<p>You mean like $499 dollars for an iPad? You gots to pay for anything dude. How old are you?</p>
<p>Not the point. Everyone charges for hardware. But Microsoft is the only company trying to play middleman between Netflix and the Internet, and it&#8217;s a ripoff.</p>
<p>Yes. That is 100% of the cost of Xbox Live. Every penny goes towards watching Netflix. How informed of you.</p>
<p>But you will need an Applle TV won&#8217;t you</p>
<p>yea, cant wait to change my weapon in Skyrim on my appletv&#8230;.   o wait..</p>
<p>seriously, it be cool to be playing skyrim on the 360 and look down and see my inventory  or map on my ipad and instead of swiping through using the controller&#8230; easily do it on the ipad..</p>
<p>The feature set of the 360 and its relative sales numbers are so far beyond the league of the Apple TV that you&#8217;re either entirely unaware of the facts or you&#8217;re trolling.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s an Apple fan&#8230; Of coarse he&#8217;s entirely unaware of the facts. They all are.</p>
<p>You are BIAS. (Vergecast callback)</p>
<p>I am both an Apple &amp; iOS Fanboy &amp; an Xbox fanboy. Super excited for Smart Glass. Assuming Apple fans are &#8220;unaware&#8221; is irresponsible to say the least.</p>
<p>apple can bring whatever they want, I know 100 with 360s and 0 people with apple TV&#8217;s</p>
<p>no you will need an apple tv that dose like 10% of what the xbox dose and dose not play games.</p>
<p>lol, no u wont need an xbox, but you&#8217;ll need an apple tv and an iphone and an ipod&#8230; thats what.. $1,500 worth of eqipment? Stfu isheep.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like 1/5 of that.</p>
<p>The difference is, microsoft has an xbox in more hosueholds than apple has it&#8217;s apple TV.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s all over the world. Apple tv is tiny in the us and unheard of elsewhere.</p>
<p>but you will need an apple tv though.</p>
<p>&#8230;but you&#8217;ll need an apple tv.</p>
<p>There are already 60+ million xboxs. Compared to less than 10 million apple tvs.</p>
<p>Yeah you <em>only</em> need an apple TV.</p>
<p>Reverse that.  Microsoft did this with the Xbox 360.  Soon, you won&#8217;t need an apple TV to run it.  Apple TV may exist, but it certainly hasn&#8217;t proved itself in any way (including actually existing).</p>
<p>Unless Apple releases the Apple TV as a gaming platform with a DVD/blu ray drive, it will appeal to a different market than the Xbox. Sure some of the same features overlap, but not the same product.</p>
<p>&#8220;you won’t need an xbox to use it&#8221;</p>
<p>But you&#8217;ll need an Apple TV. And an iPhone or an iPad, since they certainly won&#8217;t be extending their service to competing platforms like Microsoft is.</p>
<p>How many people have an Apple TV? Or let me rephrase, how many people will buy Apple Tv? Compare it to the number of xbox&#8217;s out there and find the facepalm  to your question.</p>
<p>I know a ton of people with an Xbox and an iPhone/iPad. I don&#8217;t anyone who has Apple TV.</p>
<p>WOW, THANKS FOR THAT VERY VALUABLE INPUT.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need an Apple TV and an iPhone and an iPad. Pretty much same cost, and you won&#8217;t have to use those disgusting apple products.</p>
<p>Right, you won&#8217;t need an XBOX you will need an Apple TV instead. So what?</p>
<p>Maybe. AppleTV doesn&#8217;t play games and sends very little information (just album &amp; time) back to the iOS device. I love the Remote app and Airplay but this is more &amp; different than that.</p>
<p>actually I doubt that Apple would do any of this any time soon. What MS has jet again failed to do is THINK in basic terms about the activity that they are supposedly trying to simplify. When you watch a TV show or a movie or any other kind of entertainment it all about having an immersive experience. I don&#8217;t want stupid ads I don&#8217;t want distractions and actually I prefer it when people STFU when I watch something. Well the MS product is nothing but a distraction to your entertainment and as such it fails completely at what it&#8217;s meant to do. This doesn&#8217;t reinvent anything. In fact all it creates is more information overload. And no I am not saying that the iPad and Apple does it better but the only way you can improve the TV watching experience is by improving the TV and NOT by adding a 7&quot; secondary display &#8230;</p>
<p>I hope the next XBox comes with some kind of technology where Win 8 and Windows Phone can interact exclusively for things like showing videos. It&#8217;d be cool just to flick it towards any kind of device, XBox or Win 8 and just have the video shared instead of pairing and finding the device etc.</p>
<p>But still, I&#8217;m pretty excited, it&#8217;s finally all coming together now.</p>
<p>exactly, airplay-like streaming is a feature i miss most on xbox&#8230; i was disappointed with xbox companion apps on wp7 and w8 because they were just remotes..<br />
i like smartglass features, especially swapping the sherlock holmes between devices, but if they make it work only with paid subscriptions like netflix and hbogo, then it&#8217;s just another feature that is useless in my country&#8230;. i have my own video collection and i would like to use it :)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly the Problem I see too, there won&#8217;t be any Content Provider for this in Germany and I am not allowed to use the available Content from america&#8230; and here I thought this is what this whole globalisation is all about</p>
<p>sometimes Deutschland is just Scheiße. Ums mal denglisch auszudrücken.</p>
<p>To be honest &#8211; I&#8217;ve got the feeling MS is pushing a lot more for worldwide partners. You can see it with the zune already where they&#8217;re quickly adding new countries to the featureset.</p>
<p>Germany will probably be getting one of the bigger ones in a year or two. some 80-90 million peopel is nothing to scoff about.</p>
<p>It will have to require a streaming service, there&#8217;s no doubt about it. Whether it will work with whatever streaming services are available in your country is yet to be determined, but I&#8217;m guessing that Microsoft is working their hardest to get everybody on board, and are using both theirs and Nokia&#8217;s global contacts to make it happen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very possible that the iOS &amp; Android versions will have as many features as MS can cram in but things like playing non-MS videos from an iPhone to an Xbox will never happen (well maybe stuff you recorded on the iPhone camera). They can certainly give the Windows versions of Smart Glass more features because of the way iOS apps are sandboxed.</p>
<p>To think about Smart Glass possibilities<br />
Playing Fallout it could be a Pipboy, Playing Skyrim would make it an Interactive Map, <br />
While in GTA, Smartglass would enable you using your own phone as the in-game phone</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait the first generation of Triple A games with Smartglass enabled</p>
<p>Am I missing something with the gaming thing here? If you are playing a game using a controller, switching between that and a tablet for an interactive map just seem stupid. The phone thing would be kinda cool if done right.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re missing a lot of things.  The more you comment, the more it becomes apparent that you&#8217;re just someone not getting anything and mad about it, leading to the stereotypical reaction of crapping all over it because you don&#8217;t understand it.</p>
<p>This SmartGlass thing is obviously big already because it has the AppleCore scurred.</p>
<p>Lolol, just had a mental picture of a bunch of sheep scurrying in a pen with apples painted on their backs.</p>
<p>You clearly don&#8217;t play many video games.  Just the act of <strong>switching</strong> to the map in games like Skyrim &amp; GTA is laborious and painful, let alone interacting with them.  Digital maps were practically MADE for touch interfaces.</p>
<p>May seem stupid but my guess is that Microsoft saw the Halo Waypoint ATLAS feature as a testbed for this technology and people liked it. An enhanced map would be sweet &amp; only a glance away.</p>
<p>I was with you until I you mentioned using your phone as an in-game cellphone&#8230; and then this happened:<br />
<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-czuCU6ISt-8/TzfQuCAUQDI/AAAAAAAADQo/gFmm4lAtM54/s1600/Crying-meme.png" /></p>
<p>Whats wrong with using your phone as in game phone, i think that would be very cool</p>
<p>That meme represents a positive reaction.</p>
<p>totally made the wii u look like a bag of shit.</p>
<p>Imagine Mass Effect 2 hacking and bypass on a tablet.<br />
Imagine the hacking interface from the Watch Dog gameplay trailer as a tablet or phone &#8220;app&#8221; you can access anytime.</p>
<p>This has the potential in gaming to actually increase the immersive-ness of a game by forcing &#8220;off-screen&#8221; content to actually be dealt with off-screen.</p>
<p>Not pairing this announcement with an $75 Streamer Box was a bit of a miss IMO.  It&#8217;s true that Apple will be doing a similar thing with Apple TV this year, it would have been better if they&#8217;d tried to go head to head.  At the very least drop the price of the Arcade to $99.</p>
<p>At this moment XBox has a larger install base than Apple TV so this is what they&#8217;re relying on.  But building an ecosystem means competing in all classes and giving forcing a new buyer to choose between Apple TV, Roku, or Cheap or Feature Limited XBox.</p>
<p>Well, Xbox 360 is already selling faster today than any of the ones you mention, so it&#8217;s really up to them to try to compete with the Xbox, not the other way around.</p>
<p>you are forgetting that today people buy xbox for the games, it can only grow bigger.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that it requires a $60 per year fee just to use the media features.</p>
<p>Wait&#8230; what? How much a year?</p>
<p>So expensive!  I will have to take out a small business loan to float the annual $60 after buying a $300 xbox and $300 in games. /s</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, the $60 provides tons of value added content, such as online multiplayer gaming.  How much does Blizzard charge for WoW?  $16 a month for one game?  Xbox charges $60 a year which includes online multiplayer for all xbox games as well as all the media features.  The price isn&#8217;t bad, but the fact you have to pay extra for netflix is.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly. Microsoft is making content deals with EVERYONE! That isn&#8217;t free. They put my $60/year to GOOD USE. That&#8217;s more than I can say for some companies.</p>
<p>what kind of name is smartglass</p>
<p>I thought that initially but it kinda makes sense when coming from the Smart TV angle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really really really really clever play on the Windows metaphor.</p>
<p>Yeah. </p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I believe you&#8217;re thinking about this?<br />
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/02/google_smartass_server/" target="_blank">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/02/google_smartass_server/</a></p>
<p>Why is it that everytime I go into a MS article on this site I have to meet a persistent numbskull at the very top that makes all the other comments crappy&#8230;.is that shaun wilkinson guy for real&#8230;..</p>
<p>Yeah. Trolls like him ruin this site.</p>
<p>I was ready to agree with you till I saw your profile pic. Fanbois in either direction ruin sites like this. People need to have a level head and put bias remarks aside.</p>
<p>Expecting everyone to have no bias and be like robots is unrealistic. All we can hope is everyone is open minded and civil</p>
<p>That video makes the thing look like such a gimmick, great idea though, but undoubtably dead in the water.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I thought as well.. about the Kinect</p>
<p>yeah toby,  thats what you said about the xbox too.</p>
<p>This needs to work without XBOX, like between WinPho and WinRT and Win8.</p>
<p>¿Why would you want to watch a movie in the 15&quot; display of your Windows 8 computer instead of the 42&quot; display of your TV?</p>
<p>If for no other reason&#8230; portability.</p>
<p>Well they took out Windows Media Center out of Windows 8 and Pro (unless you pay for the Media Pack).. so if people want to use their computers as their media centre with their televisions, I think smartscreen is the best way for them to allow their customers to do so. They can control the xbox music or video app with their phones and not with a dedicated remote anymore. Windows 8 is quite big screen friendly now too.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re watching a movie with the kids and have to leave. You move the movie to your tablet hand it to the kids and actually make it out the door on time for once.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a xbox.</p>
<p>Then get one&#8230; it&#8217;s a hundred and fifty bucks&#8230; But I guess you&#8217;d rather spend $600 on an iPad, $100 on an Apple TV, and $700 on an iPhone, right?</p>
<p>that&#8217;s the point, Microsoft don&#8217;t want u to use windows 8 as a HTPC but instead use your Xbox as one.</p>
<p>But this is the first time Microsoft will have all the pieces setup for all xbox, windows and windows phone users to access the same content easily. I reckon they will bring this to Windows 8 eventually. It might be one of their secret features that they won&#8217;t announce until closer to release.</p>
<p>And pay $60 per year for the priviledge.</p>
<p>How much is it again?</p>
<p>Freaking Parrot.</p>
<p>Lol, some people.  You realize that those content deals with Comcast, HBO, and all your other favorite providers, as well as the developers who make all this possible are not FREE right? Microsoft puts my $60/year to GOOD USE, which is more than I can say for most companies. The Xbox is always improving, this alone is proof that my money isn&#8217;t being wasted.</p>
<p>It does, WP &#8594; W8, w8 &#8211; &gt; WP, etc. I really want to see the amazing potential of Smartglass fulfilled.</p>
<p>Any information on whether you can use this to stream your own videos/content? That&#8217;s what really makes Airplay (esp. Airplay Mirroring) really cool in my opinion&#8230;</p>
<p>When did Microsoft get so cool&#8230;?</p>
<p>Actually I always found their R&amp;D department to be cool. Like the Microsoft House thing..</p>
<p>Microsoft research does bring out amazing stuff here and there.</p>
<p>Surface has been around for years and it&#8217;s amazing, just not practical.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also working on holographic technology right now, the demos have blown my mind.</p>
<p>Eh I meant more the small little programs they release here and now.</p>
<p>Yeah, was that the video with the kinect and projection stuff&#8230;? Look freaking sweet!</p>
<p>the Surface has a very different use case from standard touch devices we&#8217;re used to. It&#8217;s meant as an in situ, collaborative, learning, sharing communal technology. They kept it large for that exact reason.</p>
<p>I used it before and it&#8217;s seriously really cool. If it wasn&#8217;t for the current pricing model (aimed more at business), I&#8217;d get one as my coffee table, pop all my photos and videos on it as well as coffee table books. (just for a start)</p>
<p>Yeah totally, I&#8217;m very objective when it comes to tech stuff and hold no preference to any company, however I have to say that microsoft&#8217;s R&amp;D department seems to blow everyone else out of the water. Home OS will be in my house as soon as I can justify it!</p>
<p>ever sense windows phone 7.</p>
<p>Entire comment section trolled by one giant duche iFanboy!</p>
<p>Not true, I&#8217;m a tech Fanboy, always have been. I personally don&#8217;t care what name is on the device, I just want the best solution for me. Just because I see Apple in a stronger position in this area some how make me a troll? Well sorry for having an opinion&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not a troll than you are woefully ignorant of the content contained in the article.</p>
<p>Because your belief that apple is somehow in a better position with this is laughable. Xbox has a substantially larger install base, substantially more content and services, and this new feature will work with any ecosystem.  There is no evidence at all that apple is at any position but the bottom.</p>
<p>I can only assume you just woke up from your cave or the reality distortion field around you is so strong it brings down satellites all around you.</p>
<p>And a word of advice: console fanboys are the most defensive and aggressive in the world. Its funny to see the titans of internet nerdum go at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey Rick&#8230; check this out?&#8221;</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how all this pans out in a few years&#8230;.</p>
<p>If you know tech, you&#8217;ll know that formats get adopted not solely on the merit of their tech. An already present install base means that for many with the Xbox and already maintaining subcriptions, there&#8217;s<strong> no </strong>overhead to adopt this format. MS is supporting mainstream tablets, smartphones and PCs &#8211; essentially preserving the user&#8217;s freedom to choose his hardware as long as he&#8217;s already using Xbox as a game/entertainment console. The subscription also promises more content than free services, which comes as a value add for those looking to use it for entertainment.</p>
<p>For Apple TV, despite it&#8217;s low price, it&#8217;s still an overhead to buy that device, and even then restricts the user to specific Apple products as tie-ins. It&#8217;s just not as flexible.</p>
<p>For many, I suspect, that flexibility and the fact that the Xbox cost may already be incumbent is a lot more persuasive than what Apple TV offers on the table.</p>
<p>If you still thing Apple is in an advantage here, you&#8217;re just not being objective about things.</p>
<p>Lol. Your obviously blind then, and a blind troll at that. Go back to your pen iSheep.</p>
<p>It may well be that Apple eventually picks up noticable marketshare because its userbase will generally buy whatever they sell, but as it stands, Xbox and the Xbox service has beaten ALL comers in the battle of the living room, including Google and Apple and the rest of the smaller players.</p>
<p>We make assertions on the information and the reality now. Anything else is just sheer speculation and when the compeition is so far behind, to declare that they will win is absolutely delusional; even if it does happen.</p>
<p>The lead that MS has in the living room space is not a minor lead. It&#8217;s signifigant and they continue to move faster and faster to make sure they stay in the lead. At this point in time, it&#8217;s just wishful thinking to say that Apple will win this, especially with their latest release of AppleTV, which seems to have become a gigantic iPhone.</p>
<p>Great premise; not so great name..</p>
<p>I have to disagree, I quite like the name.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but my brain tells me to read &#8216;glass&#8217; as in &#8216;glass of water&#8217; instead of &#8216;glass&#8217; as in &#8216;window glass&#8217;.</p>
<p>My subconscious is such a jerk to brands.</p>
<p>So I may not think this is as great as some people seem to but I do think that the Microsoft UI team are killing it right now, it looks really great and a head of Apple right now compared to what Apple  are offering with Apple TV.</p>
<p>I do think that is going to change big time with iOS 6.</p>
<p>Ahhh yes&#8230; this comment represents that moment where you&#8217;ve realized you just foolishly wasted a ton of time arguing nothing.</p>
<p>Lol. There is literally ZERO information available about iOS 6 and yet you believe that it&#8217;s going to change the world and destroy everything else that&#8217;s actually innovative or new. By reading the comments, you have to realize how thick headed you are. Literally EVERYONE is against you, even the other iSheep!</p>
<p>No. Apple&#8217;s too busy trying to catchup with their own mapping service, as well as keep having to rely on Google for web serach. MS has all these covered. They&#8217;ve doone the hard yards, especially Bing, but it&#8217;s all finally mature enough that they don&#8217;t have to rely on noone else. They have a true closed system now, albeit a closed system that encompasses all the devices, starting from mobile, to tablets, to laptops, to desktops and to the TV</p>
<p>I JUST GOT WHY THEY CHOSE SUBSIDIZED XBOX&#8217;S NOW.</p>
<p>To charge even more for Xbox live?</p>
<p>Yeah apparently it costs $60.</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>I love you</p>
<p>Love it!!</p>
<p>This is really great.</p>
<p>For anyone who spends hours with their Xbox and a mobile device should not be surprised by this reveal.  This is not to say I am not elated by this news because this is exactly the direction I hoped MS would go.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what the future has in store&#8230;</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an an example of what the future of Kinect could bring:</p>

<p>Microsoft is lining themselves up nicely for the next generation of consoles. We must not forget that their main competitors right now are Sony with their PS3 and Nintendo with their upcoming (and seemingly DOA) Wii U. As Microsoft continues to gain content partners they are now moving into the entertainment arena and its clearly scaring those in this arena.</p>
<p>I own an appleTV, a Roku XS and an Xbox 360. The only thing that kept my apple tv plugged in was the NBA and YouTube apps. No You Tube (officially) on the Roku and no NBA on the Xbox. Up to last week I&#8217;d have to use the Roku for movie rentals (via Amazon..no interest whatsoever in Zune or iTunes rentals or purchases) That changed when Microsoft brought Amazon Video to the xbox last week (48 hour rentals + Prime ftw)</p>
<p>Things my xbox can do hat my AppleTV can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>ESPN3 (a godsend for cable cutters during the nba playoffs, they announced yesterday that the WatchESPN app is coming by fall, hopefully this serves as a separate application as I don&#8217;t and have no intentions of getting cable)</p>
<p>Hulu Plus (the airplay workaround is severely lacking when it comes to quality and requires an iOS device)</p>
<p>DVDs (yes physical media is pretty much dead but we all have dvds lying around and not many people have the time or space to rip them all)</p>
<p>Windows Media Center (as an extender this is great but Apple could possibly catch up depending on the Airplay restrictions in their upcoming OS X Lion)</p>
<p>Gaming (no not that cutesy angry birds crap, I&#8217;m talking real deal full fledged online capable and local multiplayer games)</p>
<p>Right now the only thing the apple tv has over my Xbox is its price really, and considering you can purchase a new console for as low as $199 (or $99 on a two year contract) then it might not be much of a big deal to some people.</p>
<p>Microsoft does however need to clean up in a few areas before they can rule the entertainment space however.</p>
<p>1] remove the need for an xbox live gold account fur the streaming services. The $60 per year (cheaper on Amazon) premium was once justified and is okay for multiplayer online gaming but considering more people use Live for things other than gaming this has to go.</p>
<p>2) The 720p limit on non Zune content is one I understand but it&#8217;s not on the PS3 our other streaming boxes such as the Roku and only hinders the viewing experience for many people.</p>
<p>3] Blu Ray player (considering you can pick them up pretty cheap now this is less of a necessity but it would be nice to have everything in one place&#8230;.streaming is great but when I love a movie I always buy the blu ray and enjoy the hours of bonus content it offers as well as the convenience of having it on hand in 1080p with no need to buffer or re-rent)</p>
<p>4] bring out a $99 stream only box. Why not? I think it could outsell a lot of the boxes on the market already and the content us already there..this us a no brainer to me</p>
<p>These things coupled with yesterdays announcements about content and smartglass would cement Microsofts place at the top of all consoles and have them heading in the same direction in the battle of set to boxes.</p>
<p>At E3 it was announced that the NBA app was coming to Xbox.</p>
<p>5. Ads and &#8216;featured content&#8217; shouldn&#8217;t take up 70% of the screen. If it&#8217;s really a &#8216;home&#8217; screen, then let me customize it. As it is now there are two squares on the left for me and the rest is random marketplace content. No other set top box has this many ads clogging up the interface, and the fact that I&#8217;m seeing them while paying for Xbox Live Gold makes it even more annoying.</p>
<p>Hey did you know that it cost $60 a year to keep the media features active with an XBOX Live subscription? I don&#8217;t think you knew that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s extortion</p>
<blockquote>Extortion (also called blackmail, shakedown, outwresting, and exaction) is a criminal offence which occurs when a person unlawfully obtains either money, property or services from a person(s), entity, or institution, through coercion.</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Apparently you have a gun to your head.</p>
<p>If you replace <em>douchebaggery </em> with <em>coercion</em> it sounds more like Apple to me.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t charge a yearly tax to use other people&#8217;s services. Nor does Roku or PS3 or Wii.</p>
<p>I have an old AppleTV and a new AppleTV. I had to buy the new AppleTV to do Airplay. That&#8217;s a cost right there.</p>
<p>I have an old iPad, I would have to buy a new iPad to do mirroring with the new AppleTV. That&#8217;s a heavy cost right there.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how that is any different.</p>
<p>But when the new Xbox comes out you will have to pay for that as well. And you&#8217;ll still have to pay for Xbox Live. Which ever way you want to pitch it, MS is charging an extra fee on top of everyone else.</p>
<p>No. This will work with the same device that has been around since 2005.</p>
<p>Apple &#8220;forces&#8221; you to buy a new version of each model every year to get them to all work together.</p>
<p>I think I just pissed my pants.</p>
<p>Objection. Relevance to the discussion at hand.</p>
<blockquote>just to get Netflix to talk to the Internet?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Why do you have to pay a yearly fee to MS in order to stream Netflix?</blockquote>
<blockquote>paying $60 a year it into a media streaming box?</blockquote>
<blockquote>pay $60 per year for the priviledge</blockquote>
<blockquote>You have to spend $60 a year on the Xbox just to keep the media features working.</blockquote>
<p>Dude, enough.  An Xbox Live Gold sub gets you more than just Netflix.  You sound like a damn fool.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But It shouldn&#8217;t be require to use Netflix.</p>
<p>OMG. WE GET IT.</p>
<p>You could have an actual discussion, instead of just complaining that I have a point here.</p>
<p>Look, pal, if people don&#8217;t want to have the discussion you want to have, spamming your comment over and over again isn&#8217;t going to make them more likely to want to talk to you.  You acted rudely in this thread.  Don&#8217;t try to blame other people.</p>
<p>Where was I rude to anyone? I have been very civil. Anyway, I&#8217;m out.</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>Thank God, Captain Parrot.  Return to your flock.</p>
<p>Yes, and I shouldn&#8217;t have to pay for the Oprah channel to get ESPN.  But I do, and I pay it anyways because it&#8217;s worth the price.</p>
<p>But that is the only way that you can get ESPN. There are many other ways to get Netflix none of which require an additional subscription fee to a 3rd party.</p>
<p>So?  Is anyone holding a gun to your head and forcing you to use an Xbox?  If you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth it, don&#8217;t buy it.  What is your problem?</p>
<p>The problem is I have an Xbox, but I don&#8217;t play multiplayers games anymore. Not I have to choose between paying the MS tax, or having the 360 box turn into a dumb console and be useless as a set top box. Meanwhile I see AppleTV and Roku serving up just as much content without a yearly fee.</p>
<p>It sounds as if you made a bad investment in a device that has too many features then what you really want.</p>
<p>You wanted a tire-swing, but you bought a roller coaster.</p>
<p>Holy crap you&#8217;re a broken record.  I counted 30 comments by you on this thread alone, 26 of which are the same complaint about the $3 / month Xbox LIVE fee.  Nobody is making you pay it!  Continue to live carefree in your Apple world of $5k laptops and let us live our own lives!  I&#8217;ll gladly pay YOU $3 / month to stop saying the same thing over and over!</p>
<p>In the time you spent here you could have made more than enough to pay for at least a couple months of Xbox Live. Most people don&#8217;t have a problem with $3 a month. I have never heard anyone say that is was too expensive lol.</p>
<p>And actually, I <strong>could</strong> get ESPN without Oprah with an Xbox Live Gold account.  Bam.</p>
<p>I about peed myself.</p>
<p>My best guess is that MS will go down with the price a bit. Not a huge lot, but a bit.</p>
<p>No they won&#8217;t. $5/month is low enough. Think of all the content deals and experience improvements and new innovative things that Microsoft is adding on to the Xbox. These things aren&#8217;t free, my $5/mo ($60/yr) is used well by Microsoft and I have no problem giving it to them. If you have a problem with the service, don&#8217;t use it. If you don&#8217;t think its worth your money, use something else.</p>
<p>Not to mention you can get Year Subscriptions for $30-35 regularly on Amazon &amp; Ebay.</p>
<p>Turned up the volume to listen to this guy&#8217;s voice, then The Verge outro destroyed my eardrums since it was roughly 8000 times louder than the guy speaking.</p>
<p>As someone who is firmly entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, I gotta ask: is yelling, &#8220;Apple already did it! Apple already did it!&#8221; as the first comment really neccessary? Microsoft is finally starting to do some interesting things again after years of wandering. Good competition is not something to be fussed about. All it does is make better products for us, the consumers. Microsoft is finally making me pay attention again with Windows Phone, Metro, and so on. I fail to see how this is anything other than a good thing.</p>
<p>Great comment &#8211; I would only add, that what makes this more attractive is that I don&#8217;t have to feel compelled to keep buying a certain brand device. If at some point I want to try a different OS on any given device, Microsoft&#8217;s living room solution is attractive.</p>
<p>theverge should change their name to &#8220;touche&#8221; as it seems like everyone is correct based on their comments</p>
<p>Come you guys, how did Apple get it&#8217;s name into this? The Apple TV is a hobby for the company. If Apple put there hearts into it like Microsoft is doing with the Xbox then you can compare the two. For now The Xbox wins this round against it&#8217;s real competitors (i.e. Sony). I really like this SmartGlass feature and I&#8217;m not more compelled to buy an Xbox for both gaming and Entertainment. I do see the draw backs mentioned in the comments too however.</p>
<p>Yes it IS a hobby right now but I honestly feel that Apple has all the pieces in place to dominate this market with a new Apple TV.</p>
<p>P.S just because you have a different opinion to somebody it doesn&#8217;t make you a troll&#8230;</p>
<p>STFU MAN! WE GET IT, YOU LOVE APPLE, NOW STFU AND GO COMMENT ON AN APPLE ARTICLE! Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Bunch of inferiority complex riddle isheep in this post.</p>
<p>They are scared because they know xbox is winning&#8230;.  both in mindshare and marketshare.</p>
<p>Whats up with all the Apple TV comparisons?</p>
<p>This is just bonus value you get from your XBOX 360.  im sure MSFT is not competing with Apple TV with this.  They are making sure they stay dominant in the Console market.  Sony and Nintendo should be the comparisons you should be making.</p>
<p> Apple isnt the center of the universe.  Who is threatened by Apple TV?  Apple TV is the Windows Phone of Home Media.</p>
<p>lol the very first comment sent off a shit storm of Apple vs. MS.</p>
<p>God, i hate the internet sometimes.</p>
<p>THIS is how Nintendo should have done it. Support all kinds of tablets as Wii U gamepads.</p>
<p>I think the Wii U has a much better approach than  Microsoft on the gaming side.</p>
<p>lol did you see there conference they only had pikmin and mario to announce</p>
<p>Because I want to buy a new $400 console just to play games with a touch screen controller that is big and awkward to use. Also I want to pay extra for each additional one for multiplayer games. And an additional fee for a normal controller if I want to play an old game without a big clunky controller.</p>
<p>But in all seriousness, this is a better solution. Even if you would have to pick up a separate device to switch (which may not be quite as nice as having a touchscreen built in) I feel like this still blow Wii U out of the water. Letting me use any touchscreen as a controller? Winning! So when I have all my friends over they can also play using the controller (smartphones) that they brought.</p>
<p>While I admit it is hard to beat the old school Nintendo franchises (Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, etc) I think this pushes Microsoft into the lead as far as gaming goes. No new hardware required, just new (free) software.</p>
<p>Personally, I think they both have their merits.</p>
<p>The Wii U will have their new controller included in all of their systems so developers will know 100% of the owners will have the device, where as Microsoft doesn&#8217;t include anything, so you would have to operate under the assumption that the player has a smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>And tablets and smart phones are most likely better quality then the Wii controller  ( &#8211; the hardware buttons)</p>
<p>True. A controller needs physical buttons for me, period. Wii U controller is a controller with a tablet in the middle. That makes it entirely different than trying to use just a tablet and software controls.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that you meant that the Wii U controller will be better quality (as it has hardware buttons, not most tablets). That fact, and the fact that the Wii U controller will ship with each Wii U device make it a very attractive closed system that will make quality control very easy for Nintendo and 3rd party developers.</p>
<p>I think that it is a reasonable assumption that most x-box live subscribers either have a smartphone  (at least 50%, but very likely more as people who use console games are probably more technologically active than those who don&#8217;t <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/generation-app-62-of-mobile-users-25-34-own-smartphones/)" target="_blank">http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/generation-app-62-of-mobile-users-25-34-own-smartphones/)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>(at least 50%, but very likely more as people who use console games are probably more technologically active than those who don’t</blockquote>
<p>So, hypothetically lets just assume that 60% have a smartphone or tablet.. You can&#8217;t make a needed, full feature to a game that doesn&#8217;t allow 40% of your audience to use it. With the Wii, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/5/3066384/zombiu-wii-u-preview">since all of the systems come with one you design your entire game around it, giving it a more in-depth feel.</a></p>
<p>Also, I said that the smartphones and tablets will be better quality, because making the controller better then a $500 tablet is unreasonable.</p>
<p>So yeah, I agree it&#8217;s attractive for third parties.</p>
<p>Dude seriously only Apple fanboys have Apple TVs. I don&#8217;t even know why they are cheering for it. AirPlay? The Xbox has both casual and non casual games. It has a huge install base.The current Apple TV will probably be abandoned by the next one which most people point out to be revolutionary. Even if it is the Next Xbox will come out soon and will most defiantly learn from the latest Apple TV and be better. The only reason I see for anyone to get an Apple TV right now is if they are the hugest Apple Fan Boy and have all their products.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember seeing how the other device connects to the xbox. Because I have an older xbox without wifi. I really don&#8217;t want to have to buy the adapter to use these features&#8230;</p>
<p>Really? It seriously escaped you that you can simply use your regular network connection?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have a router with ethernet ports?</p>
<p>Apple has been putzing around with this concept and &#8220;hobby&#8221; for so long you`d think MS would be behind the curve yet again but if this works as advertised it would give you everything Apples been spoon feeding you for years.</p>
<p>Don`t force me to buy a Metro tablet and an XBox.</p>
<p>This won`t be iOS compatible.<br />
No way Apple allows an Airplay competitor in the app store.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea the shitstorm media blitz Apple would see if they denied Microsofts Smart Glass application due to anti competitive desires?</p>
<p>I hope you`re right.</p>
<p>I`d grab an XBox just to check it out but Apple has done this before and often, granted not to Microsoft.</p>
<p>I find it funny when Apple customers\users complain about the price of other products when they are know for buying over priced Apple products. You can blow air with your mouth and as fair as Apple sign appears in the it, some will pay ridiculous money for it. I have a friend who purchased those $500 or what ever amount Apple sepakers for his ipod and i couldn&#8217;t hear the music 2 meters away. Great value for money.<br />
I have a PS3 a don&#8217;t care about all this Microsoft vs Apple war here but i think this is a great thing for Microsoft.  For once they are getting ahead again and simply turning the xbox 360 into a full media center is good.  People were buying them exclusively for the gaming experience first. Now they get even more.<br />
I don&#8217;t think everything evolves around Apple. I have never purchased an Apple product before and can&#8217;t see purchasing one soon. I see no reason whatsoever buying for a example a Mac for $1500 or more when a good performance laptop from other brands will cost me $600. Perhaps i see the point of Apple fans though, buying a cool brand is cool. I have an expensive Beats By Dr Dre headphone.</p>
<p>I do believe Apple should get in the console game business. They need to provide a system that can do more than just stream media content. Just like how the iPhone and iPad&#8217;s success owes much to games like PvZ and Angry Birds, not going into games in the living room means a giant hole they cannot compete against with MS. If Apple goes into gaming console, it will be very exciting to see how they do.</p>
<p>If apple made a gaming console, it would be the end of console gaming in a bad way!</p>
<p>If Apple made a tv, it would be the end of the tv business in a bad way. If Apple made a plane, it would be the end of the air industry in a bad way. Seriously mate, you can&#8217;t just pull things out of the blue and say Apple will do well in this or that &#8216;&#8217;becuz they&#8217;re like so totally the bestz&#8217;&#8217;.</p>
<p>Apparently every comment with <strong>60$/mo</strong> in it is getting upvoted.</p>
<p>This is a test.</p>
<p>You know, it&#8217;s hard to take a troll seriously when their grammar and spelling is so bad. I mean, if you&#8217;re trying to insult someone, or a brand, or an idea &#8211; at least have the damn decency to do it properly. Reference: This entire thread so far.</p>
<p>I think this is great for microsoft. I hope it  takes off and has a very successful launch when they take out the app or the web based app. For the people that are comparing it to apple tv. I believe the 360 is adding way more functionality for your buck. Besides you can get the $99 xbox 360 with kinect. I know theres a 2yr contract of $15 but i know a bunch of people that will buy it in a heartbeat. It&#8217;s the intro price that gets them. Besides it comes with kinect and microsoft is adding more apps every year. Also $60 isn&#8217;t bad for a year. I bought a $40 year sub of xbl last year during the black friday sales. So it feels like im not paying anything extra. I mostly use my 360 for gaming but this machine is mostly on throughout the day. We&#8217;re either watching movie through hbo go, or watching tv through the fios tv app this machine has it. Plus my daughter loves playing the happy action theatre game with kinect.</p>
<p>Oh hey, it&#8217;s yet another attempt to deliver sideband bonus content to complement what&#8217;s on your TV set,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s failed due to lack of demand every time it&#8217;s been tried in the past 40 years, from Videotex to WebTV to &#8217;Shazam this advertisement and you can get more advertisement,&quot; but maybe this time it will be different.</p>
<p>One thing I don&#8217;t get. Do the video and music services require an Xbox? Can I just use these on a smartglass app on any mobile device, or PC, or Xbox.</p>
<p>If this is a cross-platform / platform agnostic media (music, movies, tv) service then this in itself is a huge win for Microsoft, especially if it includes the reincarnation of Zune Pass music subscription.</p>
<p>I think that its the coolest think that all the apple talk is going on in this thread &#8230; when a console breaks out of its shell and starts to beat its own competition as well as stir up the pot for other mediums were people are makeing a fuss about it you have truly done something inovative ( Keep kicking ass microsoft!!)</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s on a kick now of combining and decommissioning services.  Hey, Vic and Brad, let me circle RSS feeds, and I won&#8217;t need Reader anymore!</p>
<p>Agree, and on that note&#8230; Let&#8217;s clean up all these messaging services and maybe even combine into Google Voice while you are at it.</p>
<p>They are.<br />
<a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/06/27/google-to-merge-hangouts-talk-messenger/" target="_blank">http://gigaom.com/2012/06/27/google-to-merge-hangouts-talk-messenger/</a></p>
<p>Thanks. Now let&#8217;s get it done&#8230;</p>
<p>it would be awesome to have an &#8220;iMessage&#8221; type app for android. It would make my tablet that much more awesome.</p>
<p>Gtalk?</p>
<p>You should check out the &#8220;&#8221;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chat-for-google/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd&quot; target=&quot;new&quot;&gt;Chat for Google</a>&quot;  extension for Chrome(it&#8217;s made by Google) and it&#8217;s pretty much what you said, only lacking the Google Voice Messaging and that could be cos am not in the US.</p>
<p>But I love Reader&#8230;</p>
<p>Whoa, if Google brings Reader to Google+, they would see a LOT of usage for Google+. Make it work Google!!</p>
<p>Having RSS feeds in Google+ is exactly what Vic and Brad (Google) do NOT want and this is why there is no API to write post on Google+<br />
A lot of companies are abusing APIs on Facebook and Twitter to use these social networks as glorified RSS feeds with no real conversation and engagement.<br />
Google doesn&#8217;t want Google+ to become another glorified RSS feeds where companies generated content pollute your stream.</p>
<p>Cool video player guys!</p>

<p>&#8230;forgot this wasn&#8217;t reddit.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cKy2v.png" /></p>
<p>Josh looks sexy in pink</p>
<p>Its a very artistic effect.</p>
<p>The weird thing is, i think it would even save sb nation money just using youtube. Actually, because of that revenue sharing thing might even make money, though i&#8217;m not completely up to snuff on that.</p>
<p>So SB is spending money, to host videos through a video player that is w/out a doubt worse than the free option&#8230;.crazy.</p>
<p>It seems to be a SB nation principle to use in house services whenever possible. I think it&#8217;s a reliability thing, on that note I have never had a problem with the SB nation video player and have had plenty of YouTube black screens.</p>
<p>But then wouldn&#8217;t it make more sense to go back to the first video player (the one that was used before youtube) so that people with non flash mobile devices, and even people on desktop would be able to play without any problems. <br />
I don&#8217;t mean to be a dead horse, but the community has definitely been the most vocal about this player. Lots of issues.</p>
<p>Well I just watched it on my iPad so i personally don&#8217;t understand what people are on about</p>
<p>Hell with non-flash devices, though its believed flash is disappearing, most consumers like flash, and don&#8217;t want to see it go.</p>
<p>I wish they did Youtube, I&#8217;ve never had a Verge video work properly, parts get blocky and pixelated and I can&#8217;t figure out how to stop it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had a problem with the Video player here.<br />
I&#8217;m using Firefox FWIW</p>
<p>is that the new instagram video filter ?</p>
<p>OH MY GOD so it&#8217;s not just me? I&#8217;ve been going nuts trying to figure out what was &#8216;wrong with Chrome, or OSX&#8217;&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess the issue is The Verge.</p>
<p>Not sure why they don&#8217;t default to something more ubiquitous like YouTube to play their videos. Pretty annoying to see a video on their sites or in their Google+ posts and then have to search for it on YouTube to be able to watch it&#8230;</p>
<p>Their old video player was much better. I wish they didn&#8217;t get rid of it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, YouTube doesn&#8217;t allow you to include your sponsors Ads before &amp; after a video.</p>
<p>Yeah they do. There&#8217;s a setting in accounts to sow a specific ad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gonna go out on a limb and say its about money.</p>
<p>Hey Dougestey, would you mind shooting us an email at <a href="mailto:support@theverge.com" target="_blank">support@theverge.com</a> letting us know some more about your system specs and maybe what browser you&#8217;re using when you see artifacting like this? Thanks!</p>
<p>I hope he doesn&#8217;t.<br />
This Flash video player needs to be replaced, not improved.</p>
<p>Wish they&#8217;d offer the videos in HTML5 too for those who ditched Flash ages ago.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;ta ditched flash. How old is your computer that you ditched flash?</p>
<p>Blackberry &#8230;I was eating&#8230; you made me choke with that one</p>
<p>I wonder if they&#8217;re doing anything for Windows Phone.</p>
<p>You bet they are. They mentioned Chrome on Windows 8 they can easily port that to Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>By the look of things Google wants their services everywhere. They want to penetrate other ecosystems anyway they can and I think that is how they are going to gain more and more marketshare.</p>
<p>I thought Chrome would get there, but I&#8217;m thinking more of G+ apps and Drive etc. They&#8217;re already giving linux trouble with Drive, and I can&#8217;t remember hearing anything about G+ for Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Its defiantly going to get there not sure when but hopefully by the end of this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;defiantly going&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;ve seen this error too many times&#8230;</p>
<p>The Windows Phone 8 will get it, I guess. Probably not for 7.8.</p>
<p>G+ has just got a big boost on iOS, Docs &amp; Drive now having offline support on iOS, Chrome coming to iOS&#8230; I&#8217;d say they&#8217;comitted to other OS&#8217;, I&#8217;m sure Win8 will get love too, probably not 7.8 though</p>
<p>please&#8230; enough with the flash vids.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Get a device that works&#8230;</p>
<p>I do. I use the chrome browser on my gnex  but have to use the stock android browser  to see these vids. The flashy app makes things a little less painful</p>
<p>Flash is one of the most used and convenient formats on the internet.  You&#8217;re complaining that a site is using something akin to a web standard. Flash is here like its always been and its going to be here for a while.  The world isn&#8217;t changing because you don&#8217;t use a Flash enabled browser.</p>
<p>so what do you recommend on mobile devices?</p>
<p>Flash works great on my phone.</p>
<p>so does mine</p>
<p>Quick browser switching thanks to device multitasking.<br />
I use Chrome+Dolphin, sometimes stock ICS browser.<br />
I have no problems, officer.</p>
<p>A &#8220;standard&#8221; means a very percise thing, flash is not a standard. It&#8217;s widely used but it&#8217;s not a standard.</p>
<p>True. The world is changing because Flash (fake web standard and all) is a pile of shit.</p>
<p>Glad you&#8217;re stuck in 2006. The rest of us are moving on.</p>
<p>Flash is a dying technology that should already be dead. Especially in mobile.</p>
<p>exactly, even google is not including the original browser in its nexus 7. so the only way to see flash vids are to download an alternative browser and switch to it for the vids that do use flash</p>
<p>and the lord goad himself gave us Dolphin HD</p>
<p>Mmm&#8230;so i guess iphones, ipads, windows phones, and pretty much every symbian device just doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not including all the desktop computers, and browsers of all different stripes that have the videos play with all kinds of playback and stuttering issues like the one in the picture above.</p>
<p>I just watched it on chrome on my pad, not sure what people are complaining about</p>
<p>Windows 8+Chrome, no problems whatsoever.<br />
Doesn&#8217;t even get problematic with IE.</p>
<p>Same with my ICS Eee Pad,</p>
<p>I bet that if they switched back to html5 there&#8217;d be people complaining about it too. Such is the state of internet video.</p>
<p>I would love to use G+ instead of Facebook, it&#8217;s just that none of my friends are using it. It&#8217;s the same reason why everyone still uses Windows. Complete saturation means it&#8217;s too much of a hassle to change unless Facebook really, really destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Agreed. Fo me, G+ needs <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/22/3109823/google-1-year-later">more, engaged users</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah. The problem is Facebook went through that stage for about 2 years where anyone who had signed up constantly nagged anyone who hadn&#8217;t to get them to join. Finally a high enough proportion of people joined that most people felt like they were missing out if they didn&#8217;t.<br />
Now Facebook already exists. To get people to switch in the same numbers G+ either has to be so much better than Facebook that it&#8217;s worth all that effort, or so integrated into Google plus that people join &#8220;by mistake&#8221;.</p>
<p>In my opinion G+ is already far superior but people don&#8217;t know about it.</p>
<p>I think you are missing their whole strategy though. Google has a ridiculous amount of users with google accounts. The point is over the next few years google+ IS going to be google, like we have seen with search for example. If you hate it go to bing but otherwise the people that stay will be using google+ whether they like it or not and then suddenly the tables are turned, why go to this separate Facebook website when everyone is already on google? Even if people do go to Facebook they don&#8217;t care, everybody is already using google+</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they aren&#8217;t worried in the slightest.</p>
<p>G+ is trying too hard. Google keeps throwing features at it that no one is really asking for &amp; few felt were missing in their lives. It&#8217;s a confusing cluster of a social network not really knowing what it wants to be.</p>
<p>Think you&#8217;re definitely in the minority with that opinion</p>
<p>I think the lack of engaged users compared to every other major social networking site show that I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Wha?</p>
<p>I feel like they add features I&#8217;ve wanted. Going to a concert with friends and then trying to get everyone&#8217;s photos the week after was a hassle to me and I actually had wished for something like party mode. I feel like it&#8217;s something that I could use for not just following websites and articles like I do now but actually interacting with friends. The only problem is how deeply integrated Facebook has gotten into other things. People won&#8217;t leave it so easily. I was on the edge of making a facebook account after two years of being off of it because of Spotify. That&#8217;s the real reason people won&#8217;t move away from it yet.</p>
<p>I know that&#8217;s the line coming from Gundotra, but until you turn on your profile (&#8220;upgrading to Google Plus&#8221;, Vic somewhat disingenuously calls it) and start adding people to circles, you&#8217;re still not really using G+. You&#8217;re just using Google services.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s better than Facebook. It&#8217;s certainly not <em>that</em> much better. It seems to have potential, but to get everybody and their mothers to switch it needs to blow people&#8217;s socks off. The events thing and party mode look great, but they&#8217;re not enough. And so I can&#8217;t really use them yet because most parties won&#8217;t have many other G+ users there.</p>
<p>On the subject of events, Gundotra showed that you can invite users by email address. They don&#8217;t have to be on Google+.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that events is the first of many new mindblowing features that will slowly get users to switch over from Facebook.</p>
<p>In my mind, Google+ is already <em>much</em> better than Facebook, but it&#8217;s in subtle ways. Comment editing is wonderful. Being able to add <strong>emphasis</strong> and format text nicely is also great. The way Google+ handles photos is really great. It makes much more sense to me to be able to upload 10 photos from an outing at the same time, as opposed to having to select each individually and add them to an album.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be the same as googles model currently. You can use ogle without an account. You can go to google.com and search for anything anonymously but to use the full potential you need to sign in. Let&#8217;s look at chrome, to get the tab syncing and all the cool stuff you need to sign in.</p>
<p>In the future it&#8217;s going to be &#8220;please update your account to use this feature&#8221; because all the features are going to be tied into the google+ layer. Everybody is going to click that and suddenly everyone has google plus.</p>
<p>I mean that&#8217;s already happening without them pushing it too hard. A lot of my friends have actually set up plus accounts, they just haven&#8217;t used them yet. I don&#8217;t think it will be hard for google to pull these people back when over half of the web they use are google plus products. It will just be a &#8220;oh hey everybody is on this now, maybe I will give it another shot&#8221; they post and their friends see it and there ya go, you&#8217;ve got a snowball.</p>
<p>Google+ is already surperior to Facebook. Those new mobile apps are amazing, they are incredibly functional and pretty, some of the best apps I&#8217;ve ever seen for a mobile device. Not even in the same universe as facebooks webview which is slower than m.facebook.com yet consumes battery like crazy non the less.</p>
<p>Google plus is an incredibly young social network, they are actually doing astonishingly well. What Horowitz said about &#8220;tech pundits&#8221; is true. You can&#8217;t expect a Facebook competitor in a year. It&#8217;s very hard to break into a social market and draw people away from services and they are doing much better than I would have expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can’t expect a Facebook competitor in a year. &quot;  While this is certainly true if you&#8217;re starting from scratch,  Goog has &gt;400M users to add &#8216;automagically&#8217;!  People just don&#8217;t care all that much about G+.  No one I know,  even Google fan boys,  are using G+ over FB because no one they  care about is on it.  And those people don&#8217;t care about it either.    Also &#8211; once FB launches a native app instead of that stupid webview version those iOS users will probably be even more enamored with it.</p>
<p>If they said hey all you google users are now google+ users a lot of people would be pissed off and a lot of people would never use it. They need to gradually do that, which makes sense because only now is the product starting to get Facebook competitive, they to events, now they need a groups competitor and it&#8217;ll be ready for prime time.</p>
<p> as for people using google+ I use it, I can&#8217;t use it as much as I would like but it has replaced twitter for me. I enjoy google+ ridiculously more than Facebook and my friends that use it do too. The only complaint I have heard is that &#8220;my friends aren&#8217;t on it&#8221;. When you have a social product that is surperior to Facebook but just doesn&#8217;t have the users yet it&#8217;s a good position to be in, especially only one year down the line. Couple that with the fact that it&#8217;s baked into android and you&#8217;re on to a winner here.</p>
<p>Give them another year. I bet itll be a lot more fleshed out.</p>
<p>That notion would keep them there. See, if you&#8217;re not moving, they won&#8217;t because you&#8217;re there as well. Take the jump. I got some over, not all, but little by little I&#8217;m going to coax them.</p>
<p>i keep saying this but ignore your friends and make new one son g+.  Very friendly community</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use stuff I hate just because &#8220;all my friends are there&#8221;. If all your friends lived in the ocean, would you move there?</p>
<p>Probably..</p>
<p>As in under the sea? I think living under the sea would be incredibly cool. Ever seen those pictures of the restaurant where the ceiling is glass and you can see all the fish overhead? So cool.</p>
<p>If G+ gives me a button to extract all my info and photos from facebook, then automatically send invites to my friends over there, then I&#8217;ll be using my G+ more.</p>
<p>I eventually got annoyed by Facebook enough that I left for G+, anyway.  As they trickle in, I circle my friends again.  I&#8217;m enjoying G+ way more than I did Facebook in the meantime.</p>
<p>Same here</p>
<p>Use both, I know the people in real life on Facebook, i wish I knew the people on G+ in real life&#8230; G+ is the better ecosystem for relevant discussions.</p>
<p>Interesting to see Josh talk about improving the commenting experience.  <strong>hint</strong> <strong>hint</strong></p>
<p>Seriously, you can even edit comments on Facebook now.</p>
<p>So if I want to watch videos on the Verge, I have to go to Youtube to be able to see them? Is this is 21st century? just checking.</p>
<p>Seriously guys, these video players you are using on the site are just terrible&#8230; I know you need revenue, this player you are using it not worth it, horrible horrible experience viewing the video.</p>
<p>At least offer a fallback to YouTube.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear more about what&#8217;s not meeting your standards. Are you experiencing the same artifacting/aliasing issue mentioned above, some other issue, or is the criticism more aesthetic? Feel free to shoot us a note with your system specs and the browser you&#8217;re using at <a href="mailto:support@theverge.com" target="_blank">support@theverge.com</a>. Thanks!</p>
<p>Loading times. Remember that speeds in different countries vary, and for me in South East Asia the Youtube player has always been the fastest. Please do use that.</p>
<p>Sublime Video works well :)</p>
<p>Why do you like to make people feel uncomfortable Josh? Seriously.</p>
<p>I received a phone call about you today. It&#8217;s bad news.</p>
<p>test came back positive?</p>
<p>When the great Topolsky gets a phone call, it&#8217;s probably much worse.</p>
<p>Best friends don&#8217;t keep secrets from each other X)</p>
<p>To be fair, getting people a little out of their comfort zone, lets the audience see a little bit of reality/&#8220;realness&#8221; bleed out to us that will probably never meet Vic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interview technique, you throw people off their guard so you don&#8217;t get the same canned response that they are giving to every reporter.</p>
<p>To be honest though I think he was just having fun. Vic definitely did not feel uncomfortable at any stage. I actually thought the interview was awesome, I hope Vic comes on On The Verge at some point. He sounds like he is an interesting easy going guy that would make a great guest.</p>
<p>Have you noticed most Verge news have more G+ shares than Facebook likes?&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t beat Twitter, but that shows <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>It shows that normal people, which is the other 95% of the world, don&#8217;t really care about tech.</p>
<p>This is often the case, it&#8217;s because if you plus something I doesn&#8217;t flood your friends streams so you don&#8217;t need to think do i really want all my friends to see this.</p>
<p>The way google handles it is it stores that plus information and then delivers it back to the user if he/she goes looking for similar content. I really really like this about g+, if I want to share I should have the option to it a share button.</p>
<p>Exactly, I LOVE that about the +1 system. You can +1 guilt-free, but if you want to share you actually get granular control over who sees what you&#8217;re sharing. It&#8217;s so brilliant compared to the garbage FB system.</p>
<p>The Google Glass is distracting..</p>
<p>The real question is was it distracting to Josh. So,  was it Josh?</p>
<p>Vic is probably watching YouTube videos during the interview.</p>
<p>24/7 cat vids in your face!</p>
<p>One thousand Recommends to you, sir.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the picture I thought, my god, what is growing on the side of that poor man&#8217;s face? I sure hope Google is intentionally making the prototypes large and obnoxious, and that the production versions will be rather less obvious.</p>
<p>Not only would I never wear anything like that, I doubt I could take anyone seriously who showed up with one of those things on their face. (This assumes, of course, that they actually move beyond the &#8220;It&#8217;s a camera! For your head!&#8221; feature-set.)</p>
<p>Yes, and then some—it&#8217;s laugh-out-loud ridiculous looking.</p>
<p>No normal person will ever buy or use such a device.</p>
<p>Why in Sir Ive&#8217;s name would they make the mechanical part such an obvious garish color?! I realize they&#8217;re bulky as hell, and not really going to disappear, but at least let them fade into the background a bit.</p>
<p>Just me or it feels like they are trying to lower the expectations of Google+ from &#8220;building a social network to rival facebook&#8221; to &#8220;unifying google services&#8221;?</p>
<p>I mean if you want to unify Google Services, just allow me to manually adjust the items on the black bar so the services I use often aren&#8217;t buried in the More dropdown menu. (No Chrome Extension required).</p>
<p>Or you make Google+ a command center to view all your google products at once. I leave GMail open to view my inbox and to check out who&#8217;s online to chat with. Feels like Google just keeps on throwing more and more features into Google+ hoping to attract you to their service when all you need to really do is fix your layout. :::shrug:::: my two cents.</p>
<p>I would say the media initially made the expectation &#8220;building a social network to rival facebook.&#8221; Google has always said that Google+ is &#8220;just Google.&#8221; That&#8217;s why they chose the name they did.</p>
<p>Spot on!!!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s nonsense &amp; copout.</p>
<p>Google said from the very beginning that they weren&#8217;t trying to replace other social networks. Even if they were, G+ is a better Twitter replacement than Facebook (though it is becoming a great Facebook replacement, too).</p>
<p>Great interview Josh</p>
<p>Very impressed with what they said too.<br />
Love the new tablet &amp; phone version of G+ Events is a great example at how they look at what&#8217;s already around and look to massively improve on that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s doing a great job of stitching together Google&#8217;s other services.</p>
<p>It is the best network too, very active<br />
Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao1OX3UN25EvdHRWR3lwWXQ0a0RhWnFuWml5RnJHdkE#gid=0">spreadsheet of shared circles,</a> add something your particularly interested in, and start interacting = instant active social network&#8230; Of course getting your friends out of Facebook&#8217;s lock-in is a whole different matter.</p>
<p>I need Vic Gundotra to do a good Jeff Goldblum impression.</p>
<p>This guy is smart&#8230; I like how he&#8217;s framing Google Plus as Google&#8217;s effort to bring Google&#8217;s services together.  I think that&#8217;s a better strategy than being a facebook competitor.</p>
<p>This is a great interview so far. Vic Gundotra is a boss.</p>
<p>Google is putting themselves in positions to take over the internet<br />
Not too sure if that&#8217;s a good thing</p>
<p>You&#8217;re forgetting that google is &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; company. If it was facebook or microsoft or apple, it&#8217;s reasonable to get concerned. oops, those are trying&#8230;</p>
<p>Google has had its fair share of mishaps throughout its time with privacy, censorship, etc.<br />
The &#8220;don&#8217;t be evil&#8221; slogan isn&#8217;t exactly an official motto for Google<br />
If I remember correctly, not long ago Google had to change privacy policies that allowed them to share user&#8217;s data to third-parties. At this very moment, Google is continuing to seek out user info. eg Google Now, Plus, etc<br />
If ANY corporate party was taking over the internet as Google is trying to, there would be reason to have concern</p>
<p>I like how this article has more Google+ shares than Twitter and Facebook</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a card carrying Google fanboy.  But I really appreciate the fact that Josh asks the tough questions.  He has an almost uncomfortable way of cutting through the marketing and getting down to the real questions.  That&#8217;s why I read the Verge.</p>
<p>He definitely knows how to sell newspap&#8230;.. I mean&#8230;..</p>
<p>Hear hear. Glad he doesn&#8217;t play by the book and reproduce the same questions that everyone asks; ones that lead them to just reiterate whatever they said in the presentation. This feels more like a conversation between a company and someone truly wanting a bigger picture.</p>
<p>Super interesting coversation. If all of my friends used Google Plus, I would never use Facebook ever again.</p>
<p>so can I unify my experience with Photos so I get the Picasa tools and have it look good like the rest of Google?  Google should not forget about the brands they have while they focus on the brands they want.</p>
<p>Here in Germany Google+ is already in the neck of Twitter.  <br />
Comscore statistics of May 2012:<br />
Twitter: 4,371 Million unique visitors<br />
Google+: 4,253 Million unique visitors</p>
<p>Horowitz is smart.</p>
<p>As a recent film school grad, I just wanna issue a huge &#8216;Thank You&#8217; to The Verge for being the ONLY tech/entertainment blog that takes their video content seriously. The Verge is always posting videos that look and sound great and aren&#8217;t just shot on an iPhone. It&#8217;s fantastic. Keep raising the bar dudes. You make Engadget and Tech Crunch look like a bunch of amateurs. Seriously.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re telling me that Engadget and Tech Crunch aren&#8217;t a bunch of Amateurs?</p>
<p>Spot on.</p>
<p>Oh no, I was saying that because of the difference in quality control, The Verge is finally offering a great alternative to the other two big dogs, who do in fact suck.</p>
<p>Oh My, when Josh said &#8216;Blackberry&#8217;. That was fantastic. Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; uh&#8230; No plans for Blackberry&#8221; <strong>Smile</strong></p>
<p>Listening to Vic and Brad wax eloquent on their vision of a unified Google experience and considering the announcements made in the keynotes, you have to admit, Google is in the forefront of defining (and more importantly realizing) the future of internet life. As much as I love and use Apple products, as long as I&#8217;ve been on Facebook, and as much as I admire Amazon&#8217;s success, I&#8217;m glad Google is leading the charge vs. the other guys.</p>
<p>that video player is the worst.</p>
<p>Vic is so passionate about Google and their products, really nice to listen to passionate people about their products. hmmm</p>
<p>Some people commenting here still don&#8217;t understand the point that G+ isn&#8217;t competing with Facebook. #Facepalm.  I use lots of google services, and I&#8217;m pretty happy it&#8217;s all getting integrated the way it is.  I also use Facebook, but it seems that everyday it&#8217;s becoming more of a mess. Take risks FB!</p>
<p>Josh is great.</p>
<p>Video is just a black box to me (win7, chrome)</p>
<p>Wow Vic is smooth!</p>
<p>Vic really loves to fudge his stats.</p>
<p>250 million+ accounts? Okay.<br />
150 million engage with Google services &#8211; so that&#8217;d be Gmail, Reader, Calendar, YouTube etc. &#8211; not necessarily G+. Oh? Another metric &#8211; 12 minutes on average. That&#8217;s nice, but they&#8217;re still avoiding saying a percentage of actual G+ user engagement, likely because outside of Google it&#8217;s crickets chirping and tumbleweeds.</p>
<p>FYI I love Vic Gundrota&#8230;his personality and presence is great and I&#8217;ve said that since I/O 2010. He needs to be the defacto spokesman for Google period&#8230;He is as great a public speaker as Steve Jobs was despite seemingly being his polar opposite&#8230;he&#8217;s a guy you wanna have a drink with.</p>
<p>I think Google knows this and that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s the first guy you see come on stage, now only if they let him handle all the presentations&#8230;</p>
<p>He also has the winningest smile and demeanor. Watch him at 10:11 :)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gallerynucleus.com/assets/attachments/32011/original_Heroworship276.jpeg" /></p>
<p>The explanation about no twitter or other source integration was very condescending.  Just say you don&#8217;t want to cross pollinate or cooperate.  Anything else is complete BS.  People are smarter than that.</p>
<p>If the system is anything like android it will be possible for devs to integrate their services anyway.</p>
<p>Android has never needed to tout &#8220;Deep integration&#8221; with other services because it&#8217;s always been there, I really hope that whatever OS Glass uses follows this trend.</p>
<p>Ah I see what you meant.<br />
My mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackberry&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Awkward pause</strong></p>
<p>Those two seem incredibly out of touch with what real humans actually do with and want from their computers.</p>
<p>I may be noisy, but my deep belief is that without implementing Content Channels  and Shared Groups Google+ is losing its battle against Facebook (Fb has groups but not channels).  The lack of Content Channels and Shared Groups makes G+ extremely noisy, there is no proper way to filter out unnecessary information.</p>
<p>Google adds external features and UI whistles and bells to Google+ instead of implementing fundamental missing parts:<br />
1) <strong>Content Channels</strong> <a href="http://goo.gl/dD902" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/dD902</a>. Lack of Content Channels leads to ever increasing noise problem on G+, makes it barely usable.<br />
2) <strong>Shared Groups</strong> (that what Facebook has and one reason Fb still wins)<br />
3) <strong>Boolean Operations on Circles</strong> (graphically implemented, so that average user can understand it).<br />
4) Maybe <strong>Linked List Comments</strong> <a href="http://goo.gl/gzpcu" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/gzpcu</a> too, although it is less critical.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/wxjHj" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/wxjHj</a></p>
<p>Bradly Horowitz said that &#8220;communities are developing&#8221; on G+.  I&#8217;d say that was happening at the beginning, but is happening less and less, instead a broadcasting mode (like it is ob Twitter) is starting to prevail. The reason? Exactly what I tried to say above: Shared Groups are one most successful way of creating communities on the Web, one which Facebook was smart enough to add to their service. Communities, which are centered around some common interest. For example, as Aging Fitness Addict <a href="http://fitnessaddictdiary.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://fitnessaddictdiary.blogspot.com/</a> I&#8217;m participating in several specific fitness-oriented groups on Facebook. There is currently no way to do so on Google+.<br />
While Content Channels are not community-building tool, strictly speaking, they would still allow to filter noise, for content consumer to subscribe only to that type of content a particular content producer is publicly broadcasting,  which is of an interest of a consumer.</p>
<p><strong>Linked List Comments</strong></p>
<p>Now,<br />
About linear comments vs. threaded comments. A big group of Google+ users had a long brainshtorm session on it, then there was an <a href="http://goo.gl/gzpcu">excellent proposal</a>.  We tried hard to notify Google employees, but no one even drop any comment on it. Taking about Google interacting with its customers&#8230; it did in the  past at he time of Google Buzz. Now they seem to only care about their own ideas, sometimes out of touch of what community needs.</p>
<p>What was proposed in great details &#8211; so called Linked List Comments, which is a <em><strong>linear</strong></em>  system of comments with added references to a comment current comment is responding.</p>
<p>Both prominent Google figures looks like they&#8217;re out of touch of real needs of regular G+ users&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the guy who always says &#8220;WHAT?&#8221; when people talking &#8220;hands free&#8221;  at the super market.<br />
What am I supposed to do when someone is looking straight at me with the <strong>GOOGLE-GLAZE</strong><em></em>?<br />
<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8711739/IMAGES/Google-Glaze.jpg" /></p>
<p>I love Vic&#8217;s passion and energy here. He&#8217;s so obviously excited about what he&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>That price is awesome!!!!</p>
<p>but 8GB starting :(</p>
<p>So spend an extra $50 for 16GB and stop crying.</p>
<p>but no microSD card slot :(</p>
<p>It has USB Host, not that you&#8217;d carry your USB Drive all the time but you can still have removable storage</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what the big fuss anymore about SD storage is.. Everything is moving into the cloud now, and if you&#8217;re an Android user, you should know this better than anyone.</p>
<p>where is this news coming from all of a sudden???</p>
<p>Right!  They had it all written up and were ready to push publish.</p>
<p>I demand an immediate VergeCast</p>
<p>I still cant get over the fact that its only $359 here in Canada. I spent $150 + 3yr contract with rogers for the Galaxy nexus which was $600 off contract.</p>
<p>Yeah what an amazing price!</p>
<p>I might buy one for every member of the family for Christmas!</p>
<p>The real question:</p>
<p><strong>IS THE SCREEN PENTILE?</strong></p>
<p>no, it&#8217;s not OLED</p>
<p>Pentile only refers to the subpixel arrangement.</p>

<p>PenTile or not, no LTE means Google is way behind and playing a catch up game!</p>
<p>I dont see what the big deal is.  You want to catch up to your quota that much faster?</p>
<p>Have you used a 3G&#8217;s phone in the states lately? It&#8217;s ridiculously slow, And that means were stuck with AT&amp;T or T-Mobile&#8230; No thanks</p>
<p>As I know, Snapdragon Krait SoCs have LTE integrated on chip. This was one of the reason that Tegra 3 and Exynos have been replace on North American market with dual core Krait, in OneX and S3.</p>
<p>Why this one doesn&#8217;t have LTE  ? good question. Anyway, where I am data transfers over 3G are good enough, 3.2 mbps.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a political/business decision, not a technical one.</p>
<p>Not every Snapdragon S4 SoC comes with an integrated model. Some come with integrated 3G (HSPA+) only, some come with integrated LTE and 3G, and some don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The APQ8064 (quad core Snapdragon S4 Pro) doesn&#8217;t come in any integrated configuration. Any device that uses that SoC has to have an additional chip for radios. Google chose not to include an LTE chip, for strategic reasons I guess.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(System_on_Chip)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(System_on_Chip)</a></p>
<p>HSPA+ is up to 42Mps. That&#8217;s not really slow.</p>
<p>Theoretical speeds. In real life situation, that speed reaches near 15 mbps max.</p>
<p>Incorrect. I am able to get nearly 30Mbps download with my GS3 on T-Mobile. You need to check your facts again before spewing such rhetoric.</p>
<p>Come to Alabama, home of the T-Mobile 2G everywhere plan.</p>
<p>I leave in Birmingham and I get close to 10mbps down.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not good enough for you?</p>
<p>Sounds pretty good to me!</p>
<p>Apart from the hype factor, I don&#8217;t give a crap about LTE. HSPA+ at 8Mbps or better , which I have in pretty much every urban area is plenty for me. Add to that the battery life I&#8217;m saving from NOT having an LTE radio to power too, and I would actually gladly pay MORE for a phone WITHOUT LTE.</p>
<p>I use it everyday and get 3Mbps+ consistently, would 10-15Mbps be nice (what I&#8217;ve realistically seen on LTE in the greater LA area)  of course but I don&#8217;t see the immediacy for it.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re sadly mistaken. I don&#8217;t know what part of the woods <strong>you</strong><em></em> reside in&#8230; I don&#8217;t need LTE.</p>

<p>&#8220;a catchup game&#8221;?</p>
<p>Dude&#8230;.who do you think gave us LTE first, freaking Windows Phone with the Lumia 900?  The iPhone 5??? :-P</p>
<p>I know that. What I meant was that since it wasn&#8217;t OLED, it had no chance of being pentile.</p>
<p>HELL NO!!! it is pure RGB LCD SEX</p>
<p>Nope. The Verge is now saying that the display rivals the One X.</p>
<p>agreed, i was whole all in for a Lumia 920 until i saw this news. At that price, i really could care less about LTE, which generally isn&#8217;t all its cracked up to be a lot of the time.</p>
<p>This really isn&#8217;t true until you experience it.</p>
<p>It all comes down to where you are. Traveling constantly between Downtown Toronto &amp; Hamilton my LTE experience has been subpar and unsteady compared to whats being touted.</p>
<p>Not to mention the wallet rape, the Big 3 demand for LTE.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather stick with my Wind plan and this phone off-contract.</p>
<p>remember it still does has hspa+. so at least it&#8217;s not regular 3g slow. At 299 off contract, it not too hard to forget about lte.</p>
<p>Right so just regular HSPA+ slow, I&#8217;ve never seen it go anywhere near the promised speeds, Especially on AT&amp;T</p>
<p>Phonearena did a test and found that HSPA+ 42Mbps is sometimes faster than LTE<br />
<a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/T-Mobiles-HSPA-42Mbps-network-faster-than-Verizons-4G-LTE-in-11-cities_id31387">T-Mobile&#8217;s HSPA+ 42Mbps network faster than Verizon&#8217;s 4G LTE in 11 cities</a></p>
<p>Strange. I&#8217;ve reached a max of 42 mbps, and I live in the boonies in Alabama.<br />
<img src="http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/2473/20121026102051.jpg" /></p>
<p>The problem is this is HSPA 21 sadly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually hspa+42</p>
<p>Try T-Mobile<br />
:)</p>
<p>Standard speeds aren&#8217;t that bad, it&#8217;s just a mobile device.  Mobile pages, downloading apps, how much speed is really necessary?  I turn mine off to help avoid overages.</p>
<p>Feeling exactly the same, wish I could get hands on with both right now</p>
<p>Nexus 4 + StraightTalk/Simple Moble = Save a ton of money and you&#8217;re set.</p>
<p>Vergeforce ASSEMBLE!</p>
<p>&#8230;because that&#8217;s what people in the Union Square area should be concentrating on today.</p>
<p>They are too busy battening down the hatches. Haven&#8217;t you heard? It&#8217;s the storm of the century that will happen every year now.</p>
<p>WHY IS THE HEADPHONE JACK ON THE TOP!!! WHYYY!!!!</p>
<p>THIS!! Just as they tought apple the way, they make such a stupid descision. It is wonderful to be able to put your phone in your the right way even with headphones.</p>
<p>I like it on top :P</p>
<p>Me too. I means I can put it in my breast pocket, and pull it out to look at the time.</p>
<p>Hehe. Breast.</p>
<p>Hehe. I like it on top.</p>
<p>pull it out to look at the time.<br />
Weird you look at your breast for time.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s what she said</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s much better to have it on the top. Super annoying to be on a treadmill and have it almost tip over all the time cause its sitting on the headphone jack</p>
<p>There was no event because of the hurricane, but that didn&#8217;t mean Google would delay the announcement.</p>
<p>They had most of the stories written and embargoed until after Google&#8217;s event in NYC.  Google Cancelled the event but apparently didn&#8217;t change the embargo&#8230;</p>
<p>Soory but I need 20GiB of music on my phone.</p>
<p>Why not use Google Music, Spotify, or Rdio? You don&#8217;t need to have that much local.</p>
<p>Which is now available in all of North America and most of Europe. Finally.</p>
<p>Many people should change their data plans then.</p>
<p>But not in the rest of the world. Especially the so-called &#8220;BRIC&#8221; nations, the biggest emerging economies in the world: Brazil (my home country), Russia, India and China (but, for China, we shouldn&#8217;t expect Google Music so soon, for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>Google Music is pretty easy to set-up from non-US country. It will take you around 5 minutes + time to upload all you music.  I&#8217;m using it for some time now and it works like a charm. (Sidenote: I&#8217;m from Poland)</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s true, I&#8217;d like to see that. Google keeps on spitting nonsense like this play.google.com/music/unsupportedcountry</p>
<p>Just use pretty much any free us/supported country proxy, activate the service for your regular google account, and you should be able to use it without any kind of proxy.</p>
<p>I did this the day after they first released it, and i have never had any problems.</p>
<p>man alive less than 1% of the entire world&#8217;s population is able to do what you just wrote</p>
<p>but first I have to <strike>give the proxy my personal info</strike> register via the proxy, right?</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://www.hidemyass.com/" target="_blank">http://www.hidemyass.com/</a> type <a href="https://play.google.com/music/" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/music/</a> and click Go. Then register, and after that you will be able to use normally it without proxies.</p>
<p>Rdio is available in Brazil. I just signed up, it&#8217;s good. There are some problems with availability of tracks (I guess due to record deals) but nothing too serious from what I&#8217;ve experienced.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see anything about Google Music being available in Canada, which happens to be the fairly large chunk of North America I live in.</p>
<p>All they talked about was launching movie purchases in Canada.</p>
<p>Nobody likes Canada!! ;)</p>
<p>I used a proxy and signed up in the US.</p>
<p>Or&#8230;the next time you go down to the US for any business&#8230;</p>
<p>Many people have limits to their data plans</p>
<p>Good thing Google Music has an offline mode. Pin the albums you want to listen to while you are on WiFi.</p>
<p>That can still eat up many GBs of space, and it is annoying to keep fiddling with what music is on your device.</p>
<p>Not if you manage it with playlists. I have a playlist for my nexus 7 and my Evo. I just manage what music is in the playlist on my computer, and pin the playlist once on my device. Then any changes made to the playlist are automatically reflected, making it even easier to manage than manually or through iTunes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s exactly what I meant by &#8220;fiddling with your music.&#8221;</p>
<p>not really, u can download them over wifi. and keep them without online</p>
<p>So, I have to waste time organising my music collection, downloading and deleting.</p>
<p>The whole reason for more storage is to avoid that. Your solution to micromanagement is&#8230; more micromanagement.</p>
<p>How many gigs can you listen to?  I&#8217;m always baffled by this.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s best to not fiddle with things, I agree.  But we&#8217;re talking gigs of music here.  I set up &#8216;only&#8217; 10 gigs on my iphone, and there is still music there I will never listen to.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s like a hundred albums.  So, you maybe listen to every song once in an entire month?</p>
<p>I agree 8 gigs is too small with photos and music and large apps (games).  But 20 gigs of music still seems excessive for a phone. For most people, I&#8217;m not a DJ.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have 20 GB, but music isn&#8217;t the only thing I&#8217;m going to store on my device. 16GB is going to cut it very close and if I don&#8217;t need to micromanage, I probably won&#8217;t be able to put a movie or video podcast on my device every once in a while.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll probably get 14GB usable. Apps, games, music, pictures, video&#8230; they will all add up.</p>
<p>It depends on what kind of music listener you are, maybe. <br />
I have nearly 30gb of music and still happens the &quot;Now I really feel like listening to xxx&#8230;. oh,  shame, I don&#8217;t have them in the phone &quot;. <br />
And it&#8217;s quite frustrating. (I&#8217;m not a dj too)</p>
<p>Good thing the phone has wifi and TMobile has an unlimited data.</p>
<p>Also Google Music caches the songs locally as you play them.</p>
<p>That kind of goes against what the original guy was saying. He was complaining about a small amount of space and no good way to expand it. Streaming was suggested but coverage and data plans are issues. Caching music in Google Music is no good because it&#8217;s the same as just copying the music over to the phone locally. It&#8217;s just less manageable for most non-Google music apps (Doubletwist can mess with it).</p>
<p>I mostly just rip songs from my cd&#8217;s when I get them and then lower the quality for phones/pmps (I don&#8217;t go beneath 192 Kbps since I can hear the difference below that barrier). I don&#8217;t have a huge collection but if I curate it to just only my favorites I&#8217;ll still take up most of the space on the phone. That&#8217;s not counting the space that the OS and apps will take up. 16 gigs should have been the entry level amount with 32 as the next level if they weren&#8217;t going to include sd card support. Anything dealing with the usb port is just clumsy and asking for trouble.</p>
<p>well then he should buy one of the many android phones that take sd cards.  I certainly don&#8217;t mind managing my music and I certainly don&#8217;t <strong>need</strong> more than can fit on this phone.</p>
<p>If he absolutely needs to keep all his music all the time, perhaps he should get an iPod.  You could buy this phone and an iPod touch for cheaper than an iPhone!</p>
<p>Right buy another phone and get screwed on updates. I like how the solution to getting boned on updates is to buy a nexus, and then the solution to nexus shortcomings is to buy a different android. You can&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>This is a cheap compromise, 82 cents, but it&#8217;s so inelegant and can cause issues during normal use. I know that I pull my phone from pockets located in many places very firmly. Compromising with a device like this is sure to cause storage issues due to accidental disconnects. A built-in sd card slot could have avoided that. It definitely would have been cheaper to implement and due to the economies of scale it probably would not have cost them more than a quarter at worst in their bill of materials. Their engineers are talented and I&#8217;m pretty sure it would not have negatively affected their manufacturing processes. 16/32 or 8/32 with an SD card slot only available on the model with the larger amount of storage would have let them still get more money by leading people to the higher priced device like they&#8217;re doing now. It just would have been able to meet peoples expectations better and let the phone be more versatile because of it. I love versatility in smart phones, that&#8217;s the real reason they ever take off. A balance of Versatility and Availability (price is a factor of availability, priced too high and you&#8217;re priced out of certain markets)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/T-Flash-Adapter-Samsung-GT-i9100-GT-N7000/dp/B005FUNYSA" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/T-Flash-Adapter-Samsung-GT-i9100-GT-N7000/dp/B005FUNYSA</a></p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t his concerns, his wants what business is all about? Meeting the needs of the consumer in a relationship that is symbiotically bonded with currency? I say currency because money isn&#8217;t everything that businesses are after. I can respect Google and their partners need to profit/break-even/minimize losses on their products. I would also hope that they respect the growing needs of their market/users. This is an excellent phone, no bones about it. I will get the 16 gig version of the phone when I finally upgrade (if the Nexus 7 can&#8217;t do calls and sms) but would have preferred to have been buying a $350 32 GB option. My current phone released about a year ago and had 16 gigs of internal storage standard and an sd card slot. My phone has replaced the utility of a flash drive. Anecdotally speaking, I see that a lot more often now in the field. Even with an SD card slot on both phones (or only the 16 GB model) it shouldn&#8217;t have been much of a stretch to add one.</p>
<p>This phone packs a lot of power, the latest version of Android and is in a world where the effects of letting devs create larger games should start to show their effects on storage soon. Grand Theft Auto Vity should alone take a few gigs of storage. GTA III was originally about 768 MB&#8217;s if I remember that correctly but Vice City San Andreas filled dvd&#8217;s with their releases. We have better compression tech today but compression can only go so far. You only have about 6 gigs of usable space on the 8 gig phone and presumably 14 gigs on the 16 gig phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t play many games on Android but the few that I do take up a lot of space. Super Monkey Ball, Sonic 4 and GTA III would alone take most of my space limit the amount of music I can use and the apps that I can install. That&#8217;s why the standard should have been 16/32 with an sd card slot or at the very least including an SD card slot at the current allotments.</p>
<p>With the exception of storage, there is no other major compromise to be made with this device. Our complaints/concerns come from passion here, not hate. <strong>We let our opinions be known on this because we care.</strong> It&#8217;s not to disparage all of the hard work that has gone into this phone. It&#8217;s in none of our hands yet but we&#8217;re just seeing an obvious issue/compromise that needs to be made if we choose to upgrade to this Nexus. If I can do calls over 3G without voip on the Nexus 7 then that will definitely be my next phone. Heck, if it needs voip but I can confirm some more data about latency in my area then I may get it anyway.</p>
<p>for anyone freaking out about about their music collection, think about this: with the money you save buying the N4 off contract, you can buy an 8GB Sansa Clip and a 32Gb SD card for under a hundred dollars. that way you have a dedicated music device. personally, i have a 120Gb iPod Classic for my music. only pics and apps go on the phone.</p>
<p>That limits how I can interact with my music. I use a really good stereo bluetooth headset that works great for commuting and exercising. Any cords would be a bother. I make impromptu ringtones and notification tones straight from my phone. I don&#8217;t want to bother with more than charging my phone, DS Lite and Laptop. A PMP would add another energy hungry device and another spot in data management that is for any intent or purpose cut off from my other listening sources.</p>
<p>Music is only part of the problem here. What about the larger apps like games? Would you suggest that I only have a handful then redownload them? Besides the tediousness of that situation you still have carrier data billing and throttling to worry about depending upon your plan who the carrier is.</p>
<p>Despite how impractical some people see it, it&#8217;s great being able to watch movies from your phone while in commute or in those crazy weird positions that you can get into while lying on your couch or bed.</p>
<p>Then you have the developers. You can use an app like DeuterIDE to development straight from your phone. What if you use it as both a personal device and a development tool in a myriad of locations? That limits the assets you&#8217;re able to keep directly with you that you can actually work on and edit. An SD card slot allows for less compromises. A removable battery allows for having the choice of using an extended battery or replacing your current one with little to no hassle in the process while expanding your options of battery providers significantly.</p>
<p>The absence of an sd card slot and the ability to have a removable battery are extremely significant in a device as versatile and personal as a cell phone. To accept an Apple/Closed System way of thinking is to limit yourself if you have any needs that extend beyond those that are provided for you.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t think that you need that much music, but come to think of it, all the Android music apps were a pain for mgmt.  I always fell back on itunes, which is partly why I have  an iphone.  So, you changed my mind.  While I think hundreds of albums should be enough (depending on bitrate, etc.) managing music on android is quite a mess in my experience, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s getting better, but still.</p>
<p>Well I use Rhythmbox/Banshee (on linux/bsd) and Winamp on Windows (I also hear that Media Monkey is good). They&#8217;ve all been pretty good at managing music and sync to my phone, the Zunes that I used to have a few other devices that I used to use.</p>
<p>If you use Winamp on your Android and Desktop then you can get a pretty awesome experience. Of course, if you just search for music players/managers that save your song ratings and playcounts to your ID3 tags then you should be fine on any platform that you use.</p>
<p>I agree with you, there should be a simpler way to manage music on Android from the Android. I used Doubletwist Pro for a while but stopped when I got tired of how inefficient management is on the phone when compared to the desktop. That and it doesn&#8217;t save your ratings and playcounts to the ID3 tags. I don&#8217;t need to get locked into another singular piece of software.</p>
<p>What is the easiest way to upload my music to some cloud and listen it from there and maybe some offline use.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on Android, Google Music is pretty good and really easy.</p>
<p>:/ Can&#8217;t use it in my country for some reason. :/</p>
<p>absolutely I love Google Music and you can just stream it over LTE &#8230; hey wait a minute..</p>
<p>&#8230; or you can stream it over 3G.  Neither lag at all.</p>
<p>Why would you want to stream it over 3G.  Just because its slower doesn&#8217;t mean your using less mb&#8217;s.  Weather your streaming over 3G or 4G your still streaming, this is why some people like having all their music locally.  Myself included.</p>
<blockquote>Why would you want to stream it over 3G</blockquote>
<p>To use less power.</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t get the point did you?</p>
<p>HINT: the phone discussed in the article does not come with LTE&#8230;</p>
<p>i hope that you do know its not 3g and lte&#8230; hspa+ constitutes 4g and can get about 15 mb/s down, remember 4g- speed class, lte- data transfer technology</p>
<p>Name me just ONE service that streams lossless files.</p>
<p>Name me just one phone that you can tell the difference between lossless and 320kb&#8230; your looking for excuses</p>
<p>USB OTG + USB DAC.</p>
<p>Even with an iPhone 64GB + CLAS or HPP1 I get 4 times the storage.</p>
<p>name one phone with a good enought D.A.C. to play the lossless files and a good enough pre amp to power headphones good enough to hear the difference.</p>
<p>oh wait there are NONE.</p>
<p>Galaxys s3 wolfson , u can buy another externel DAC</p>
<p>That i know of&#8230;</p>
<p>Phones: S3. Note 2. Meizu MX</p>
<p>Tablets: N7 does, Galaxy Note 10.1</p>
<p>OH the ignorance!</p>
<p>Thank you my fellow Head-Fi&#8217;ers :) Cheers!</p>
<p>because sprints sucks.</p>
<p>Exactly man, Google Music is the best fucking thing ever. 15000+ songs of my hidef Mp3 collection already in the cloud? #FuckYeah</p>
<p>Thats your OPINION</p>
<p>Yes. Because the world has been connected with seamless, wireless, internet access and that too free of cost! /s</p>
<p>get a 32GB iPod&#8230; or buy a phone with bigger Battery, I have no idea why you put the word &#8220;sorry&#8221; in your sentence, nobody needs to apologize to you, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sorry&#8221; guy is the same guy who feels that he must let you know that he is &#8220;sticking&#8221; to something. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stick to my X&#8221;. Sometimes he combines them, &#8220;Sorry, if it doesn&#8217;t have X, I&#8217;ll be sticking to my X&#8221;. lol. like anyone else cares.</p>
<p>Paul Thurrott is perhaps the best known exponent of this technique.</p>
<p>I only listen to music on the subway for the most part, and even I am still fine with a 16GB phone (GNex). I manage all my music on my NAS at home and pull things over to it over WiFi. I suppose people that like Google Music/RDio/Spotify could do the same. I am constantly switching out music from my collection usually keeping a few things that I really love. I still end up having a couple-few gigs of free space. This is with 150GB of music i&#8217;ve amassed over the years and most at 320K. I don&#8217;t understand outside of people who use video on their phone the need for that much music for the normal consumer.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with what you say. I use Spotify to listen to my music and I make a playlist and save about 500 songs off-line for when I&#8217;m in the subway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am constantly switching out music from my collection &quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kind of what those of us bitching about the storage limit are trying to avoid. I have better things to do than keep fiddling with what music is on my phone.</p>
<p>I have more music than will fit on any microSD card, but I find 32GB is a sweet spot where I can keep <em>enough</em> music on the phone that I never feel like nothing I want to listen to is on it. 16GB isn&#8217;t enough. Especially if that 16GB also has the whole OS, photos, and videos on it.</p>
<p>I uploaded half of my 380GB library (~19,868 songs)to GMusic and available to me 24/7.  Same difference?</p>
<p>Then get a different phone, problem solved.</p>
<p>Good luck watching that cloud movie on a plane.</p>
<p>Who watches a movie on their phone?</p>
<p>i do. i watch netflix shows through my phone while working. i set my phone right next to my laptop and can easily follow along while typing up emails or working on things. it&#8217;s not as uncommon as you think to watch a movie on a phone.</p>
<p>your gym doesnt have a wifi?</p>
<p>huh?</p>
<p>I watch movies/tv shows at the gym, and movies on a plane.</p>
<p>That just sounds like a horrible experience. Watching a movie is what a tablet or a laptop is for.</p>
<p>A few years back, I would be watching movies on a 3.5 inch iTouch and it was more than fine. A 4.7-inch HD screen makes that even better.</p>
<p>Because you want to be carrying a 7-10 inch tablet/13inch+ laptop to the gym&#8230;</p>
<p>If you watch movies in the gym, you&#8217;ve got more pressing issues to deal with first..</p>
<p>So, a half-hour or one-hour trip on the treadmill/elliptical shouldn&#8217;t be movie time?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually perfect for watching TV shows.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something called outside and spending 30mins on a elliptical in a gym you&#8217;re getting robbed for your gym membership.</p>
<p>Yeah cause everyone has the ability to run outside every day of the week.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of anyone who doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>10 degrees F outside after freezing rain fell the following day.  Running outside would be a bad idea.  Walking outside is dangerous enough.</p>
<p>-40 degrees, and skin freezes in under five minutes.  Bad day for running.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an entire world outside of California.</p>
<p>Gym&#8217;s are about more than just exercise, the environment there is a big part of what you get. Some people cannot focus well outside of an area dedicated to exercising/working/sleeping/etc. For some people, it&#8217;s worth it to avoid the weather. For others, it may limit the gawkers or give them a place where they can just feel better knowing that likeminded people are working with them. Quick and easy availability of a clean restroom, fresh water and a shower are another commodity of the gym.</p>
<p>You can arguably get all of this at home but for some people they can&#8217;t take exercise seriously in their own home. Me, it&#8217;s difficult for me to program or blog at home but so much easier to do it outside of the place. It&#8217;s only mental but that&#8217;s the truth of my and other peoples situations. Different strokes for different folks.</p>
<p>Shit&#8230;Did I miss a memo or something? When did arbeck become The Boss?</p>
<p>Pin it offline</p>
<p>If you want to watch something on the plane just &#8216;pin&#8217; it before you go and it will be available locally.</p>
<p>16gb is nothing, If I want to have a few books, some music, some comics, games for emulators, some videos, and with apps getting bigger.  I&#8217;m out of space.</p>
<p>Putting everything in the cloud means my data is gone before i know it. So I need to balance between cloud and physical and I can live with 32 non expandable, but not 16.  This is also the &#8220;geek&#8221; device, it&#8217;s not really a mainstream device so why compromise it like one?  Either expandable or 16/32/64 like the Iphone or even the elusive n9</p>
<p>Google want it to be a mainstream device. A 32gb option would be good though.</p>
<p>If the Nexus has hardly been a bestseller then it makes sense to limit the amount of devices produced. More models means more phones which might end up being unsold.  As for why it&#8217;s 8 and 16 instead of 16 and 32, it has to be to keep the cost down. While I agree that 32 would be best, I can understand that they are trying to compete on value for money.</p>
<p>The cloud is a much more compelling option when a device has LTE. Disappointed to see tiny storage and only HSPA+. If I were in the market for an android device, I&#8217;d be waiting out for the Galaxy S IV. Especially since the Nexus namesake no longer guarantees immediate updates to the latest android releases (I&#8217;m looking at you Galaxy Nexus for Verizon).</p>
<p>It looks like Nexus is going back to being a dev only brand, probably to appease the other ORMs and carriers.  Too bad, I was holding out for the next nexus and willing to buy off contract but this clearly isn&#8217;t for consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;but this clearly isn’t for consumers&#8221; <br />
Except that by making it highly affordable unlocked and making it work on pretty much every GSM carrier in the world it&#8217;s probably the most consumer friendly Nexus yet.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s forgetting that there is a world outside America, ssssh!</p>
<p>We will see if this phone out sells the galaxy nexus.  It looks better in every respect than the Galaxy Nexus (pending reviews) but right now it is only available in the play store.  Even in countries with no prospect of LTE and no phone subsidies or contracts, the phone will be hard to find and touch before buying.</p>
<p>Maybe google will roll the phone out in other retail channels but right now the lack of availability and no LTE point toward it being a developer focused phone in my opinion.</p>
<p>The GSIII is the last phone I am buying on contract. I would be willing to give up LTE to get this phone and some software updates.</p>
<p>Again you forget the world outside America..</p>
<p>For now only a handful of countries will have access to buying it through the play store, so they will definitely sell it through other retail channels.</p>
<p>from what i read they will try to reach more retailers and  carriers they even said worldwide</p>
<p>i believe is true because music playstore is finally reaching europe.</p>

<p>HSPA+ and LTE are just two different pieces of technology. LTE should theoretically have less latency issues than HSPA+ due to it mimicking normal networking on pc&#8217;s. Even so, unless you&#8217;re living on a need for extremely low latency and have a lifestyle where the LTE coverage is better than the HSPA+ coverage speed routinely, you&#8217;re not going to notice a huge difference. Not only that but HSPA+ radios are less battery hungry and are less likely to damage your battery due to heat generation. HSPA+ phones across variations in the same model phone usually have about an hour or more of additional talk time and have been noted to be cooler to the touch.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what HSPA+ network you&#8217;re using but here in the states But AT&amp;T sucks and T-Mobile has no coverage. This works out to be roughly 10 times speed increased from HSPA+ to LTE,  Pretty significant my book</p>
<p>Location would matter also, I use T-Mobiles HSPA+ network in Michigan and receive pretty solid speeds (when not using my regular phone which very horribly can&#8217;t use the 1700 Mhz band) that exceeds the DSL speeds that I&#8217;m used to getting at home.</p>
<p>Anything faster than DSL is good enough for me. I mostly just read while I&#8217;m online. Very rarely will I watch a video but when I do I don&#8217;t need a connection faster than 2 Mbps, I can get between 5-9 (normall it&#8217;s at about 6.7 Mbps) regularly when I switch phones. I believe that this is more than good enough for me and many other people. Apparently people in different areas of Michigan and other places across the state can get much faster speeds than I normally experience.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a major need (not that I wouldn&#8217;t love to have the fastest speeds possible!) to have speeds much faster than what I&#8217;m experiencing unless you&#8217;re trying to replace a home connection for multiple devices or are downloading many large files. I&#8217;d be happier to see consistently lower latency across networks before they worry about making them quicker.</p>
<p>LTE (or another HSPA+ refinement/improvement) is the solution for that but it&#8217;s far too early to be singing its&#8217; praises when coverage is less than HSPA+, the radio tech consumes more of your battery and is a much bigger threat to your battery when in normal use or using the hotspot when compared to HSPA+ radios.</p>
<p>Then the company with the best LTE implementation doesn&#8217;t offer unlimited data, in fact you&#8217;re given a very meager allotment. AT&amp;T already charges quite a bit for what they offer and their LTE coverage isn&#8217;t approaching Verizon&#8217;s level yet. Sprint&#8217;s coverage and implementation is a joke. Their 3G wasn&#8217;t much better than many other providers 2G services in many areas. Their LTE is only competitive against the 3G services of other carriers at this point. T-Mobile has a decent network but are very poor and is not able to attract many customers despite the things that they do right. I&#8217;m surprised that Sprint leads them but they do. Their HSPA+42 network rollout should be completing soon and their upgrade to HSPA+84 and LTE should be starting while that 42 Mbps rollout completes.</p>
<p>I believe that a balanced service is much more important than one that&#8217;s excellent in only one or a few areas. I include the financial portion as part of the balancing since it wouldn&#8217;t make sense to chase after something that&#8217;s 2x or more of the price of another service without everything I do improving by that much. My web pages and rss reader may download more quickly on the best LTE network but in order to use it I would have to move and pay more money for the service when I wouldn&#8217;t actually see a difference since my web pages are downloaded quickly enough already.</p>
<p>I would consider moving to Kansas though: <a href="http://nodiceatall.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/maybe-its-time-to-move-to-kansas/" target="_blank">http://nodiceatall.wordpress.com/2012/10/11/maybe-its-time-to-move-to-kansas/</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on AT&amp;T I can understand not wanting to be part of their HSPA huddled masses, but on T-Mobile it&#8217;s a completely different world. If you get a good signal it&#8217;s pretty wide open and LTE isn&#8217;t really a concern.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on Verizon then you&#8217;ve already decided that speed and/or ubiquity of signal is more important than becoming your carrier&#8217;s bitch in terms of phone selection. Get a GS3. It&#8217;s the next best thing. Also you guys have that 1080p HTC monster coming soon.</p>
<p>Well for me, I use a majority of my storage space for music &#8212; music that I listen to while commuting underground through the NYC subway system where the cloud is inaccessible. I can get by with 16 gigs, it just means I&#8217;ll have to manage my music more regularly. It&#8217;s just nice having the extra space.</p>
<p>And yes I&#8217;m aware that I can just buy a dedicated PMP&#8230; but that&#8217;s a compromise I&#8217;d hate to make.</p>
<p>Are they not installing wi-fi points throughout the NYC subway?  They started putting them on the London Underground a few months back.</p>
<p>No they are not.</p>
<p>Cell service on DC Metro sucks and the project to improve it was delayed for three more damn years:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thehoya.com/news/cell-service-in-dc-metro-delayed-1.2934243" target="_blank">http://www.thehoya.com/news/cell-service-in-dc-metro-delayed-1.2934243</a></p>
<p>Do you need to get your data in any crowded space, ever? Waiting room?  Airport?  Busy cofee house?  Watch a video?  Listen to music?  The cloud can&#8217;t do that.  For the foreseeable future, demand will always outstrip network availability.</p>
<p>The cloud is only a solution for people with no friends.</p>
<p>And without LTE the cloud is even less compelling for this device</p>
<p>Even if it was there, LTE would only be a mitigating factor.  Roaming wireless is subject to induced demand; more supply only creates more demand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda like the way that adding extra lanes to an expressway just results in a wider traffic jam.</p>
<p>What the hell are you even talking about?  Since when can you not use the cloud in a busy coffee house?  Do you coffee houses serve the 1000+ people that are required to overload cells?</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s talking about overloading cells?  You can connect to a cell perfectly well and still be starved of data throughput.  For instance, a 3G cell cannot supply hi-def video.  The coffee house&#8217;s internet connection might be able to, except for all the other people using the connection around you.  Even if that 3G cell could provide hi-def video, it would devour a huge chunk of your monthly data plan for a single hour of video streaming.</p>
<p>Any hi-powered media device without large amounts of local storage is like a v-12 engine with a thimble for a gas tank.</p>
<p>N.O.V.A 3: 2.46 GB<br />
TKDR: 1.80 GB<br />
MC3: 1.39 GB</p>
<p>Music?<br />
Movies?<br />
&#8230;.<br />
I&#8217;ll never forgive Google for excluding expandable storage. And USB host doesn&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>And you play all three games at once?  Delete what you don&#8217;t use.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t make much sense.</p>
<p>*Any</p>
<p>Holy shit I though Apple fanboys were bad..</p>
<p>oh, Apple Fanboys are certainly bad; but I&#8217;m finding more and more that Android fanboys are their own brand of awful&#8230;and I am EXCITED for the Nexus 4 and 10. Two very reasonably priced devices at the quality it has &#8211; seeing some of these complaints is just further proof that there&#8217;s no pleasing everybody, not even your fanboys.</p>
<p>Yep, pretty much. &#8220;I want 64GB of storage, 36 hour battery life, LTE, access on every carrier, a super high resolution screen, and an SD card slot. I also want it to do my bills, wash my car, and do my job for me at work. Oh, and I want to pay no more than $350 off contract for all of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t please everyone I guess.</p>
<p>All fanatics suck.</p>
<p>Get lost.</p>
<p>I think your missing his point, and why would anyone want to be constantly deleting and re-downloading content.  I haven&#8217;t deleted much off my phone but does the save data stay when you delete?  Other wise thats the exact reason why you wouldn&#8217;t want to delete anything.</p>
<p>Simple answer: <strong> It&#8217;s not the phone for you</strong>.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t play multi-gigabyte games on my phone, nor watch movies, and my music is in the cloud.</p>
<p>For more serious content browsing, I use a tablet.  For games, I use a desktop PC.  Whether or not this was the Google&#8217;s target use-model, it fits me perfectly.</p>
<p><b>It&#8217;s not the phone for anyone.</b></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t play hi-def video games, or watch hi-def movies, you have no need for a hi-def screen or a high-powered CPU.  It&#8217;s very simple: a hi-resolution screen is absolutely useless without the storage to support hi-definition things to put on that screen.</p>
<p>For almost every use case, a phone with a less impressive screen and CPU, but with more local storage would be a better use of money than a high-range display and high-powered CPU, without enough storage to put it to use.   This is simply an asinine design choice.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t speak for everyone. That&#8217;s rude.</p>
<p>I have a GNex with 16 GB of storage. I stream movies from Netflix and videos from YouTube. All of my music is available on Google Music, but I have like 5 GB stored in &#8220;offline&#8221; so that I can always listen to my favorite albums and songs. I appreciate the improvement in screen and camera quality, as well as the option for 32 GB of local storage. If I was more irresponsible with my money, I&#8217;d buy this in a heartbeat, but my GNex is totally fine.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to speak for everyone for something that&#8217;s true, sir.  I can say that the six-armed sweater is not for anyone, or that the escalator to nowhere is useless for everyone but those selling it.</p>
<p>In your case, I can say that your streamed-over-3G netflix has no need of a hi-def screen.  Neither your cloud music or that netflix stream justifies the fastest processor on the market.   Your use case is another example that this phone is an exceptionally bad use of resources.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t roll my eyes harder at you.</p>
<p>YOU CANNOT SPEAK FOR EVERYONE.  How much of a moron do you have to be to think you can?</p>
<p>This phone looks fucking sick, and the price point is unmatched.  I may have to pick one up, and I was just saying I wouldn&#8217;t get the new Nexus.</p>
<p>In this case, I can speak for all but a vanishingly small group.</p>
<p>I see you tacitly agree, since you&#8217;re trying to change the subject.  Imagine how nice this &#8216;price point&#8217; would be if they scaled back the processor and screen to something commensurate with its anemic storage capacity.  Or how much a better phone it would be for the vast majority of its potential market if they kept it at the same price point, but balanced its specs to something other than a screen you&#8217;ll never be able to use and a CPU that will always be idling.</p>
<p>having used a GN with the same screen resolution and 16 gb og storage for almost a year, I can say for sure that you do not speak for everyone. I would be a lot less inclined to buy this if it had a moderate screen and processor while carrying 32 gb of storage.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t &#8220;need&#8221; a fast processor and large screen, but I like my phone to be snappy and text large enough to read comfortably. Just because you have a beastly CPU doesn&#8217;t mean you need to be number crunching/playing games on it 24/7. Cell phone CPUs are so power efficient that there&#8217;s no downside to having a powerful one.</p>
<p>Give it up dude.  There are 1000 phones that suit your needs &#8211; this phone suits mine perfectly and many others&#8217; as well.  You don&#8217;t like it don&#8217;t buy it &#8211; rest assured many many people will buy it.</p>
<blockquote>In this case, I can speak for all but a vanishingly small group.</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but I disagree. Even people who don&#8217;t play games want their device to be powerful enough to be future proof (future versions of Android, etc), and because the performance can be felt in anything, watching videos, browsing the web, opening apps. You don&#8217;t have to be a gamer or store all your music on your phone to want a fast phone.</p>
<blockquote>In this case, I can speak for all but a vanishingly small group.</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m one of your vanishingly small group. I&#8217;m after a decent phone, off contract, and cost is a major factor. Don&#8217;t really want to spend much more than £200. I&#8217;ve found I don&#8217;t really use that much storage on my existing phone. The main thing I&#8217;d like a better screen for is browsing the web, and reading (small) text. Neither of which require storage. I&#8217;m tempted to stretch to the 8 gig version, because it&#8217;s so much better than anything else near the price.</p>
<p>Seriously stuck up your own ass&#8230;</p>
<p>Cloud fetishists gettin&#8217; mad.</p>
<p>SD fetishist mad.</p>
<p>all of those games are pretty awful anyway.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll never forgive Google?  lmao.  Most people don&#8217;t need that much space.  Most people will be happy to be able to purchase such a cheap and fast phone.  I know I will.  There are many other options for you to choose from, you&#8217;re just upset that you can&#8217;t get all you want at this price.  Suck it up, you want more you&#8217;re gunna have to pay more.</p>
<p>Honestly I think this is a shot fired against the carriers &#8211; cheap unlocked phones!  For most phones with these specs you pay that much and get locked into a 2/3 year contract!  I welcome the opportunity to own my phone outright. I also welcome taking some of the crazy power away from the carriers.</p>
<p>Yeah, that attitude kind of annoys me. Sure, I have endless storage options in the cloud. But only a 3gb monthly data plan to squeeze it through.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s called wifi &#8211; plan ahead.</p>
<p>Thanks Capt. Obvious. Everyone understands your little point. Quit pretending you&#8217;re oblivious to that fact that&#8217;s an annoying compromise. I could manage with 8 or 16gb if I wanted to.<br />
But expandable/more storage=better. I&#8217;m not condemning this device for recognizing that fact.</p>
<p>Would you people start demanding a good phone instead of putting up with a garbage experience?</p>
<blockquote>Everything is moving into the cloud now</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s not much use when you&#8217;ve got a metered data plan.</p>
<p>The big fuss is the average tech savy user needs more.. Sure I can send my backups to the cloud and clear out old pictures and videos every month and erase games I don&#8217;t play more frequently but why? This is an amazing phone so why not make it amazing all the way?</p>
<p>Yep, your pictures can be synced automatically with either Google+, Facebook, or Dropbox. Videos can go on YouTube. Docs on Dropbox and Drive, so many free alternatives, storage is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Two problems with that though.</p>
<p>1. What about people who are on a plane or an area with poor reception?<br />
2.  What about people who are on limited data plans?</p>
<p>who&#8217;s being forced to go on a plane with no advance notice, and going to sit on it soo long that they can&#8217;t deal with this set amount of space?</p>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t have wifi at home?  Take 5 minutes a day to organize your data.  Or buy a different phone.  Stop shitting on it for those of us who can do that.</p>
<blockquote>who’s being forced to go on a plane with no advance notice</blockquote>
<p>Some people go on unexpected plane rides or road trips.<br />
I have several full seasons of shows and movies, and thousands of songs on my phone. I may choose to access any bit of that any time. Though I may go without watching anything for days. I don&#8217;t like to spend time each day to consider what I might watch and what I might not. I&#8217;ve solved it with 48gb of local storage.<br />
<blockquote>Or buy a different phone</blockquote><br />
That&#8217;s exactly what people are discussing doing. We all know what &#8220;the cloud&#8221; is. Why can&#8217;t you just concede that expandable storage is an issue? Let some people be disappointed.</p>
<p>airplanes have WiFi now. true story.</p>
<p>Absolutely wrong.  The cloud is only a solution for people with no friends.</p>
<p>In any crowded are, there will simply be no solution to network congestion for the foreseeable future.  LTE is almost a non-issue here; more bandwidth only results in more usage.  If you need to get to your data in any airport, busy cafe, waiting room, crowded club&#8230; then the cloud fails you and will continue to fail you for years after this phone is obsolete.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced you&#8217;re actually mentally handicapped.  The only times I have issues with network congestion is when I am in venues with 10 000+ people.</p>
<p>You are either a liar or have never been to any of these places:<br />
A) an airport,<br />
B) a busy cafe,<br />
C) a full waiting room,<br />
D) a crowded bar or club.</p>
<p>In all these locations, network capacity, roaming or hotspot, regularly hits capacity.</p>
<p>Might be an issue if you&#8217;re on a crappy carrier like ATT or VZW,  I&#8217;m on T-Mo, haven&#8217;t had issues in any congested areas, including ares in NYC</p>
<p>so suddenly everyone gets decent unlimited data plans&#8230;</p>
<p>Cool, man. I didn&#8217;t know they had cloud in aircrafts, in trains, in the subway, in 3rd world countries where I like to travel.</p>
<p>Some of us need physical storage until this planet is blanketed in WiMax</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like it comes with NO physical storage. I manage fine with 16 GB.</p>
<p>Well, your case is very unique. It would be best if you get a phone that meets your needs. I am sure that there are phones that can do that  and are equally as powerful as the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>Travelling on subways is &#8216;very unique?&#8217;</p>
<p>Only when Sandy is rolling in.</p>
<p>How long is your subway commute?</p>
<p>1st world problems.  Buy a different phone and shaddap about it.  <strong>Some</strong> of us need physical storage.  Not all of us.</p>
<p>I wish you people would just admit that you&#8217;re just whining that you love the price but just can&#8217;t live without taking your whole music collection with you between wifi locations.  Yeesh, buy a different phone already.</p>
<p>airplanes have WiFi now. ;)</p>
<p>yes because cloud makes perfect sense when you need to access something on a plane or on a train or lovely dead spots. they should have just offered 16gb and 32 at $350/400.</p>
<p>airplanes have WiFi now.</p>
<p>you speak of which you know not.</p>
<p>The cloud is very subjective for a lot of people. Data plans here in Canada are insanely overpriced for barely 1gb.</p>
<p>Cloud storage simply isn&#8217;t a comparable substitute for internal storage.  It&#8217;s not as reliable, it won&#8217;t help you install large game apps.  And it certainly can&#8217;t cope with the demands of huge video files or the needs of power music listeners.  Try accessing the cloud from an airplane.</p>
<p>airplanes have WiFi.</p>
<p>Some people have different uses for their phones than you.  I store a lot of music and video on my phone, which doubles as a media player for me.  I don&#8217;t care for my phone being able to hold less video than my 2006 Zune(shut up, seemed like a good idea at the time), so being able to pop in a 64GB SD card is a big feature for me, personally.</p>
<p>The big fuss is that data caps are an unfortunate reality, and many of us also watch videos on our phones, which eats through data quickly if streamed.</p>
<p>This is a great argument to make, but a lot of folks still have data caps to deal with.  I&#8217;m personally fine with 16GB since I have a dedicated music playing device, but I understand why others are worrying.</p>
<p>they aren&#8217;t worrying, they are just mad that every phone in the world isn&#8217;t made exactly for them.  This phone is perfect for me and many others, sounds like it&#8217;s perfect for you too.  Why should we all have to pay extra for features we don&#8217;t need?  I personally am loving the price.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m not sure what the big fuss anymore about SD storage is.. Everything is moving into the cloud now&#8221;</p>
<p>One: data limits. Streaming all your media is going to hit those pretty fast.</p>
<p>Two: coverage. I don&#8217;t fancy losing my music every time I go on the frickin&#8217; subway.</p>
<p>I will never understand this way of thinking. I have a 12GB LTE data plan from Verizon but the thought of streaming to listen to music is just dumb to me. Same with podcasts. The thought of using something like Stitcher to stream instead of actually downloading the entire .mp3 of the podcast with something like Pocketcasts is very stupid to me.</p>
<p>Hipsters can try to spin this bullshit until they&#8217;re blue in the face, but it won&#8217;t change the fact that streaming never has been and never will be even close to as good as playing something from local storage. Why the hell would anyone want to deal with the spotty coverage (I don&#8217;t care where you are, there is no such thing as perfect coverage), not to mention being completely cut off during flights/etc., when a $19 32GB microSD card from Amazon completely solves all of these problems?</p>
<p>Furthermore, having that local storage available to you doesn&#8217;t preclude you from being able to stream should you so choose, whereas having only 8GB on your phone and no way of expanding it is severely limiting.</p>
<p>Cloud solutions can be a great when it&#8217;s in addition to or integrated with local storage, but they will always be inferior as a complete replacement.</p>
<p>you&#8217;re trying to spin this bullshit.  Your 1st world problems are certainly not everyone&#8217;s 1st world problems.  Go buy a different phone!  It&#8217;s as simple as that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m spinning nothing. My S3 gets great coverage almost everywhere I go but it&#8217;s not perfect,  there&#8217;s no such thing and there never will be. Anyone claiming they never have network problems are simply full of shit.</p>
<blockquote>I will never understand this way of thinking. I have a 12GB LTE data plan from Verizon but the thought of streaming to listen to music is just dumb to me</blockquote>
<p>OK but you don&#8217;t have to stream even if you use cloud storage. You simply manage the files on your phone by pinning them from the cloud (while you&#8217;re at home, on Wifi). Then, in the subway the next day, you have it on your phone.</p>
<p>Yeah that&#8217;s the type of cloud usage that perfectly makes sense to me, but this still requires storage on your phone. I think the orignal point was a complaint about having 8-16GB phones with no microSD slot for expansion. They should at least give you a microSD slot to give you the option to expand, especially for how much this phone costs.</p>
<p>Sure everything is starting to migrate to the cloud. If only our data plans would catch up to support the constant interaction with said cloud at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather be able to install those 1 GB + apps. Along with not worry about my battery life or data plan.</p>
<p>Living outside the US, the cloud for the Android ecosystem is almost nonexistent.  In Canada we don&#8217;t get cloud music, and there&#8217;s no ability to purchase movies only to rent them.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s coming, I just wish it was coming sooner. :)</p>
<p>Is the cloud accessible EVERYWHERE at ALL TIMES???</p>
<p>Get over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;therefore it is perfectly acceptable to stop trying to please people.&#8221; &#8212;every apologist for this terrible phone.</p>
<p>&quot; &#8230; ban daggar.&quot; &#8211; every the verge user ever..</p>
<p>seriously no microSD slot??? why&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Never on a Nexus.</p>
<p>Forget this phone, and buy the most definitely same priced SGS3, which still has a  microSD slot! Thats what I&#8217;m going to do, and buy one used. Supacheap.</p>
<p>Is the SGS3 $300 unlocked off contract?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably something like $450. So for people who want those extra specs (LTE, SD card slot, 32GB) it&#8217;s probably a good buy.</p>
<p>OK but isn&#8217;t it also fundamentally slower, and has a PenTile display? And isn&#8217;t it lower resolution? I mean it&#8217;s GPU is slower than the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>I also think it&#8217;s ugly in comparison, and it wont get Android updates as quickly.</p>
<p>299 for 8Gb is ridiculous on contract. This should not be over 199, and 250 at the very most. Whoever prices things for at&amp;t is a moron. Nexus phones aren&#8217;t amazing sellers anyway &amp; this is just going to insure that they only sell a handful.</p>
<p>but it&#8217;s 299 without contract&#8230;</p>
<p>oops the hype got me :) you&#8217;re right rarodrig6</p>
<p>argh now I finally reread everything. it&#8217;s 199 with contract, 299 without. nice</p>
<p>Why would you sign a contract, presumably with a big ETF and higher monthly charges to save $100.  Off contract seems like a no brainer.</p>
<p>Unless you are on a family plan (4+ people). I&#8217;ve been looking all over, and I can&#8217;t find a better deal than a family plan.</p>
<p>If you are a heavy user, the family plan can be more expensive (a lot) .</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t get an off contract family plan?</p>
<p>There is nothing cheaper in the US, and you can&#8217;t strike a deal for bringing your own phone. The problem with unlocked phones is that the only benefit is you aren&#8217;t on contract. There is no cost savings other than that.</p>
<p>Unless you go with T-Mobile&#8217;s plans (Value plans), which are cheaper  if you bring your own phone (buy it outright from T-Mo or bring it over unlocked).  Then you also have the choice of a prepaid mobile plan, such as Simple Moblile, Straight Talk, T-Mo prepaid, AT&amp;T Go Phone, etc.</p>
<p>As you right now, afaik, T-Mo is the only carrier of the Big 4 US carriers that will give you a lower priced plan if you buy your phone outright or bring your own phone on their network.</p>
<p>This.  I would totally consider a phone like this if there were actually an incentive to do so.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also get upgrades faster, probably.</p>
<p>Yea posted at the same time as you, that&#8217;s not made very clear in the article. Much better tho!</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>Will the T-mobile version get Updates right away like the off contract versions?</p>
<p>If the TMo Nexus One is anything to go off of, yes.</p>
<p>For $100 more, just get the Play Store unlocked version.  If you put it on the T-Mo unlimited 4G data Value plan, you&#8217;ll save $20/month.  That $100 is break even after 5 months and NO CONTRACT!  That&#8217;s a winner in my book.</p>
<p>Unless I missed something that&#8217;s not clear in the article &amp; that&#8217;s the unlocked, no contract price. Then it&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p>no joke</p>
<p>I wonder if the &#8220;T-Mobile Version&#8221; will have 16gb with the two year contract for $200. Either say i also dont care that it doesnt have LTE because t-mobile in chicago is better then att&#8217;s lte lol</p>
<p>Boo. You have to buy the T-Mobile version to run it on their bands. Whatever happened to penta-band? That&#8217;s some BS right there,  Google..</p>
<p>AFAIK, the unlocked Play Store version is also Pentaband HSPA+ 42,.  Should work on both AT&amp;T and T-Mo in the USA, with speeds faster than HSPA+ 21, a few people with the T-Mo version of the SG Note 2 have reported up to 25 Mbps speeds on HSPA+ 42 on the T-Mo Galaxy Note 2 forum on XDA.  Of course depending on your location, YMMV, but some of these speeds are close to being on par with LTE.  Here is one report from San Diego (not mine) <img src="http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1437247&d=1351420403" /></p>
<p>I took this about a month ago, in the Baltimore area. I used to get 22 Mbps down over a year ago when I first got the phone.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/172XN.png" /></p>
<p>there is no micro sd, so start crying !</p>
<p>16gb is nowhere near enough, at least for me. I have a 32gb iPhone and it&#8217;s always full. I know we live in a cloud world etc, but I have no connection at work, so I need things local.  My next phone will be 64gb.</p>
<p>lack of sd slot kill this phone</p>
<p>Yep, and the Galaxy Nexus had 32gigs, but the Nexus 4 has 8-16gigs. :-(</p>
<p>A 32gb micro sd is around $20. 8GB is just fine plus you have Google Drive, Music &amp; Plus</p>
<p>No LTE? What?<br />
Oh yes, that price is awesome. Also Josh, you told Google to bring their Design A Game. Do you think they did?</p>
<p>Does anyone really care about LTE? Specially when most carriers worldwide nerf it enough that you bust your data plan in 15 minutes, and when you are in an available Wi-fi range 90% of the time</p>
<p>Yes.  Yes, people care.  It&#8217;s hard to bust your unlimited data plan, and AT&amp;T&#8217;s LTE is faster than most people&#8217;s WiFi.</p>
<p>In the UK the LTE price plans are a rip off so most people will probably then for the first year anyway.  Wi-Fi is almost everywhere I would stop to use it anyway.  Most trains have it (Underground has started to install them) so thats my commute covered.  The office has it, my home obviously has it and any coffee shops etc that I stop in have it.</p>
<p>and Three&#8217;s HSPA isn&#8217;t bad either.</p>
<p>Upcoming HSPA+21 (or whatever it&#8217;s called) will get you high speeds on this phone. I get 7-9mb/s from Three&#8217;s current service, double that and I&#8217;ll be more than happy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure people care, but when the bottleneck is your <strong>mobile web browser</strong>, not your 50+Mbps data connection, LTE only matters if you&#8217;re Torrenting from your phone.</p>
<p>And it kills your battery.</p>
<p>Get real.  Running an i5 and gNexus, son has a Skyrocket.  Minimal battery impact and the speed makes a real difference.</p>
<p>Am real.  For web browsing the speed makes NO meaningful difference.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re transferring multi-GB files or Torrenting, then you have a case.</p>
<p>I beg to differ: When I get in an LTE area, browsing always improves noticeably (OTOH, I don&#8217;t get LTE where I reside; HSPA+ isn&#8217;t bad, but not nearly as good).</p>
<p>Comparing my gf&#8217;s iPhone 4s to iPhone 5, there&#8217;s a very noticeable difference.  This is AT&amp;T in LA btw.  Wasn&#8217;t the previous Nexus LTE?  This is a definite downgrade in speed.  Great price but the bottleneck is definitely that it&#8217;s not LTE.</p>
<p>If you travel, having LTE is incredible when you tether your phone to avoid slow/inconsistent hotel/public wifi (thanks, unlimited plan!)</p>
<p>Granted, HSPA+ can also grant you those speeds but on Verizon, it&#8217;s sort of LTE or bust.  Occasionally I still have to use 3g but it&#8217;s a severe drop off.</p>
<p>My speeds are consistently around 16mbps down, 12mbps up. But it&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s really not even worth using if you&#8217;re on a tiered data plan.</p>
<p>In chicago att&#8217;s lte is on par with t-mobiles 20+mbps connection but is not as consistent and t-mobiles 42mbps trumps it. But im sure by next summer ATT will have deployed more LTE radios and improved there bandwidth.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>I am currently with Three UK and get unlimited data for £15. I could move to a 4G operator but 1. I live in the middle of no where so would not get 4G until my operators roll its out and 2. I would have to pay 3x as much for much less data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone really care about LTE?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  I don&#8217;t live in the general world, I live in a particular small section, with an LTE all around me.  Living here I certainly care about being able to access it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m stationed in a part of the world where we&#8217;re lucky if we get STANDARD 3G speeds so it doesn&#8217;t matter to me at all.</p>
<p>But I can understand why LTE is a big deal to others.  I tried an LTE device a couple months ago when I returned to NY and the speeds where RIDICULOUS!</p>
<p>So like you said, LTE doesn&#8217;t matter to you.  However, it does matter to other people.</p>
<p>The question is where is the vast majority. The few people in the US with an LTE contract or the rest of the world.</p>
<p>besides there is the LG Optimus G. Same hardware and with LTE. or the Samsung S3 or the HTC One X etc etc etc</p>
<p>I know I do after having it for a little while now. Not just for the speed, but latency is greatly improved.</p>
<p>You realize the same data you use on 3G is the same amount you would use on 4G right?  Your just receiving bites faster, that doesn&#8217;t mean more.  And I care about LTE because its so much better.  Also I like so many other people still have unlimited 4G and don&#8217;t have to worry about caps, so feed me speed!</p>
<p>You are definitely right. In my case, I am either at school , work or home, and all these places have Wi-Fi. 16 GB of storage is more than enough for me. I have currently 6 GB left on my Nexus.</p>
<p>I was on T-Mobile and then switched to Verizon when the Galaxy Nexus was released. LTE was one thing I expected to be in this release too, but I guess it&#8217;s understandable if its not, plus if you&#8217;re in an area where HSPA+ speeds are decent, then it&#8217;s fine. But I&#8217;m just going to stick with LTE, hopefully the next Nexus phone has LTE in it.</p>
<p>Last year when the iPhone didn&#8217;t have LTE it seemed like every amateur critic cared that it didn&#8217;t have LTE. Now that the Nexus doesn&#8217;t and the iPhone does it seems like every amateur critic pretends it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Yes we care about LTE!</p>
<p>Not having LTE isn&#8217;t my problem&#8230; not having any Verizon bands is.</p>
<p>Exactly.<br />
It&#8217;s not terribly hard to make dual CDMA/GSM devices, and if LG had done that&#8230; this phone would be my next.<br />
Although, I must admit I would hate Verizon if I didn&#8217;t have LTE. Their 3G is terrible.</p>
<p>Sprint and Verizon do not sell or activate any devices that they don&#8217;t QA/approve. Google didn&#8217;t want to deal with that again &#8211; it must have been really bad on the GNex.</p>
<blockquote>Sprint and Verizon do not sell or activate any devices that they don’t QA/approve. Google didn’t want to deal with that again – it must have been really bad on the GNex.</blockquote>
<p>Plus the fact that nearly all the world runs on GSM and is much nicer to work with.</p>
<p>Plus all the world is moving to LTE…</p>
<p>Hardly</p>
<p>I care about LTE!! Why wouldn&#8217;t you want faster speed of data? After playing with my wife&#8217;s iPhone (getting speeds of 21mb/s) I really can&#8217;t wait for my galaxy note 2 to get here.</p>
<p>1.  Drastically worse battery life.<br />
2.  Completely unnoticeable performance improvement, because the bottlenecks lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>I get 35+Mbps on my Wifi network, and my quad-core tablet web browser still takes 2+ seconds to render a complicated web page.  The same page renders INSTANTLY on a laptop.</p>
<p>The extra speed makes no difference.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t that much worse battery life. The MDM9615 chip basically solves the problem.  It combines the voice and data into one chip, making it no worse than 3G.   Look at the iPhone 5, it gets fantastic battery life, as good as the iPhone 4S, and the battery didn&#8217;t increase at all.</p>
<blockquote>and my quad-core tablet web browser still takes 2+ seconds to render a complicated web page</blockquote>
<p>Which tablet?</p>
<p>no LTE, makes me so happy i bought the SGS3 at bestbuy friday for $99&#8230;  flashed AOKP on it 2 hrs after i bought it ;)</p>
<p>Wait, that price ($299 and $349) is the off-contract price?!</p>
<p>Aw yiss.</p>
<p>Motha<br />
F**kin<br />
Off contract price.</p>
<p>That must mean this phone is sh<img src="t!" alt="" /></p>
<p>/trololololo</p>
<p>Sold! Take my money!</p>
<p>Google thought, &#8216;hey, after this hurricane, there will be no LTE in America anways.&#8217;</p>
<p>THis is OFFICIALLY my next.</p>
<p>Wow Microsoft just got sunk. This was a crazy move by Google.</p>
<p><img src="http://johnbooth.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341ce79453ef010535b945f0970c-320wi" /></p>
<p>WOW, no curved display? LAME!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s curved, just the opposite way, lol</p>
<p>Maybe much like Nexus 7, The Nexus 4 and Nexus 10 is sold around the cost of their production.</p>
<p>I suspected the Nexus 4 would be priced agressively (given the starter 8gb model), but this price is simply unmached.</p>
<p>In a world that you can buy a phone like this for 299$, everything else just seems overpriced, even the crappy 50$ Samsungs and Nokias.</p>
<p>stop trying to detract from the biggest change for the better, Duarte replace those weird sideburns with a beard that draws the eye away from the sleeve of that shirt&#8230;</p>
<p>The price is freaking amazing! Wow!</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe the price.  I gotta sell my Galaxy S2 as soon as possible. This can&#8217;t be real.</p>
<p>All is good. Explain one thing to me. Why this has a glass back when its been proven to be bad material in terms of drop resistance?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the main and central feature, I suppose.</p>
<p>Looks like ass. I mean come on, other companies manage to make good looking Android phones, SonyEriksson makes nice ones lately, even Samsung&#8217;s look better than this. This looks like HTC designed-by-committee to offend no one and to look as boring as humanly possible.</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Is the Google Galaxy Nexus ( The older Phone also available for sale ). For some reason , I cannot seem to find it on the google play. Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>They have pulled the Gnex from google play<br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3572092/samsung-galaxy-nexus-google-play-store-discontinued" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3572092/samsung-galaxy-nexus-google-play-store-discontinued</a></p>
<p>YESSSS!</p>
<p>THE BACK IS GLASS<br />
LAWSUIT INCOMING.</p>
<p>Hopefully the back glass will be as easy to replace as it was for the iPhone 4/4S.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Gorilla Glass, so no lawsuit incoming. iPhone 4 didn&#8217;t use Gorilla Glass for the back.</p>
<p>The back was designed to break to absorb drop shock, kind of how like cars are designed with &#8220;crumple zones&#8221;.  Curious how these will fair.</p>
<blockquote>It’s Gorilla Glass, so no lawsuit incoming. iPhone 4 didn’t use Gorilla Glass for the back.</blockquote>
<p>WTF? Yes they did.</p>
<p>Apple is the very reason Gorilla glass is found on any phone. They resurrected the company on the brink of bankruptcy to make the glass for the older iPhones.</p>
<p>Pretty sure they only use it for the front though, not the back.</p>
<p>Why would they only use it on the front??</p>
<p>Of course they&#8217;re using it both front and back. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s super expensive. And it&#8217;s not like you could just put window glass on the back of a phone that&#8217;s carried in somebody&#8217;s pocket/purse all day.</p>
<p>LOL are you serious?  You think Corning was on the brink of bankruptcy?  They had seen 5 years of straight growth going into 2007.  They were hit hard in 2000, but were doing well following restructuring by the time the iPhone came around.  They also hold a good size chunk of Dow-Corning medical.</p>
<p>Corning made the iPhone possible, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Not an investor I take it?</p>
<p>My friend will be quite pleased if they announce this for Verizon.</p>
<p>Hahah. That will NEVER happen.</p>
<p>I guess he will be quite sad then. He switched to Verizon for the Galaxy Nexus and now he can&#8217;t upgrade to it&#8217;s successor, that&#8217;s pretty shitty.</p>
<p>Well, he probably has another year on the VZW contract, so he can switch then.</p>
<p>@black_man_x hinted yesterday that it will be coming in January.  However, not subsidized.  Personally,  I think most of us who still have it would prefer to keep our unlimited data than buy a subsidized phone, anyway.</p>
<p>This is sexy.</p>
<p>Now the real question.  Will there be more than one Nexus this year?</p>
<p>Of course not, all trends pointed to a boring iterative update, so someone decided to manufacturer a story line to keep people tuned in.</p>
<p>Nexus 7<br />
Nexus Q<br />
Nexus 10<br />
Nexus 4</p>
<p>Yes, there will be more than one Nexus this year.</p>
<p>So, they knew it.</p>
<p>Who the hell wouldn&#8217;t pony up an extra 50 bucks for double the storage?</p>
<p>$50 for 8GB is an extremely bad per GB rate relative to, for example, microSD cards.</p>
<p>Yeah, but even then, a phone like this for 350$ is pretty much a steal anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>its bad even compared to desktop SSDs lol</p>
<p>Wow! Just $300 for an unlocked phone and no contract?? This is unreal!</p>
<p>Yeah I agree. I don&#8217;t see how Google can make money on this. The specs are the best currently for half the price of other phones</p>
<p>They can make money off of it because normally the off contract for a phones is way, way, way higher then the cost to make it.</p>
<p>They might not be making money on it at all. They might be doing a little better than breaking even, like they are with the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Even if they break even on the hardware, every Android user makes them money off search.</p>
<p>But then most iOS users search too.</p>
<p>They are not making money off the phone. .  Between hardware costs and loss of subsidies from carriers.  They are really banking on ppl using the ecosystem I think.</p>
<p>Also I think trying to take some power away from the carriers.  I hope we can all agree that carriers have certainly abused their power.</p>
<p>High end smartphones BOM+manufacturing costs are around $200, going by the Nexus 7, to break even they had to sell it anywhere from $250 to $300, it is possible that they&#8217;re making some money from the 8GB model and they&#8217;ll certainly be making money from the 16GB one.</p>
<p>Phones re overpriced.</p>
<blockquote>Yeah I agree. I don’t see how Google can make money on this. </blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s easy, they make money on the ads they sell, not the hardware! Andy Rubin said so, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3570034/inside-android-building-the-nexus-4-nexus-10-android-4-2" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>Easy. This is quite a bit cheaper to build than an iPhone. Apple has a 40% profit margin on the iPhone. Make a cheaper phone, lose the margin altogether, bingo, $350 (16GB Flash).</p>
<p>Google is an advertising company. They make money by you using the android ecosystem.</p>
<p>That IS unreal. Free phones for everyone! retrolab is picking up the tab!</p>
<p>8GB isn&#8217;t. :(<br />
16GB would have been, but one needs to fork out $50 dollars more for that&#8230;</p>
<p>16GB maximum? Piss off.</p>
<p>Just curious, what do you need more than 16gb of storage for?</p>
<p>Much like I/O despite being marketed as for developers the line is really done mostly as gift of appreciation for the fans and power users. What I don&#8217;t think most people realize is that phone makers modify the base APIs to add &#8220;features&#8221; to their phones, and introduce device-specific bugs. For instance, the new line of Razr devices handles cursor life-cycling incorrectly. Which probably wont get fixed with the one update its likely to receive because they rarely bug fix that low-level shit. Because Android is open-source and they can pull that shit you&#8217;ve got to buy a handful of devices at a minimum to do quality assurance. One of those being a Nexus since that&#8217;s what the fans use. What LG did was design a phone for developers when they should&#8217;ve made it for fans who live on these things: games, music, movies, etc. really eat memory.</p>
<p>I have 35 gigs of music that I take on the road for months at a time. I&#8217;m sitting on buses, trains, and airplanes 30 &#8211; 50 times a year. I rarely have anything faster than an EDGE data connection. Believe me, for some of us, 16GB without an SD card slot is not enough.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s your usage case, then this phone probably isn&#8217;t for you.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re likely better off getting a dedicated music player for a use case like that.</p>
<p>How much of that collection do you reasonably listen to? I always have a hard time believing that people regularly listen to 10,000 different songs over the course of a month or two. Assuming 2.5 min per song that&#8217;s about 17 straight days of music. I for one certainly don&#8217;t spend 17 days out of one month listening to my tunes.</p>
<p>That does not matter.  Telling someone &#8220;they are using it wrong&#8221; is not really a good answer to the situation always.  They want to keep all their music there and not carry multiple devices.  There is a solution for this called &#8220;more storage&#8221;, this is better than &#8220;micromanage your music&#8221; imho.</p>
<p>seemed to work for Apple with the whole iPhone 4 antenna problem</p>
<p>I believe the solution for this is called &#8220;Buy one of the many other phones that offer more storage&#8221; instead of &#8220;Bitching about this phone for lack of storage&#8221;</p>
<p>Firstly I&#8217;m not saying he&#8217;s using it wrong. The device isn&#8217;t even out. Secondly, wouldn&#8217;t you agree that it is often best to first look inwards for the solution of a problem as opposed to complaining that it isn&#8217;t the way you want it?</p>
<p>This. Morons that keep saying use the cloud don&#8217;t realise that people sometimes don&#8217;t have an internet connection. Waiting for the 32gig version to come out in a few months.</p>
<p>I am sure some people have the need for 32GB (but where will it stop? how is 32GB magically enough for people?) but if you&#8217;re on the road all the time and need to access your media, wouldn&#8217;t getting a dedicated media player be a better idea?</p>
<p>I am not saying this for the space argument itself. I never use my phone for media playback on planes / while travelling in other countries. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to use your mode of communication for other things. What if you battery runs out and you can&#8217;t make a call when you need it? Instead, spend about $200 on a media player &#8211; have more space, and when the battery runs out, who cares? You still have your phone to do the important things you bought your phone for in the first place &#8211; make calls, look up information, maps etc.</p>
<p>Just my $0.02</p>
<p>Or you could buy an extra battery for $5.</p>
<p>where will it stop? when phones have about 1 &#8211; 2 TB, I think that&#8217;s enough. Can&#8217;t use high res movies on a phone anyway and all the other stuff will fit. We&#8217;ve got a ways to go.</p>
<p>I have a collection of movies and TV episodes that&#8217;s easily 6TB. Where oh where will I store that for when I feel the urge to watch a movie while traveling?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite ridiculous some of the claims here right? Who needs their entire collection of anything with them at all times? If one knows they&#8217;re going to be travelling, pick some stuff that you want to watch and listen to and bring it. People seem to think that&#8217;s &#8220;micro-managing&#8221;, it&#8217;s actually just managing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a 32GB card in my GS2, but I don&#8217;t think I have more than 16GB between the internal and card.  I like the extra space for Nandroids on the road, but I guess I could get used to putting those on USB OTG.</p>
<p>Friend of mine keeps all sorts of pictures and videos of her dogs and kid on it.  She is maxing out a 32GB phone.  So people do use the storage for media.</p>
<p>So she buys a 32GB phone. Does that mean every phone needs 32GB (or more)?</p>
<p>Coming from a droid incredible user which has a SD slot, I love not having to worry about having a bunch of apps, pics and movies.  Right now I use Google music but that&#8217;s ONLY because I have an unlimited plan. When I switch phones I need to either buy a unsubsidized phone to keep my unlimited plan or get one of the crappy plans over at Verizon.  Google not releasing a unsubsidized LTE Verizon Nexus 4 kinda blows IMO.</p>
<p>Time for everyone who called the glass on iPhone a bad idea to suddenly change their mind&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh, but it&#8217;s glass with a holographic effect. You know that&#8217;s tougher.</p>
<p>Lol. Yup. It&#8217;s glass that&#8217;s purposely been compromised in structural integrity by poking holes into it. Nice job, El Goog</p>

<p>It&#8217;s Gorilla Glass 2.0 on the front AND the back! Looks pretty solid to me&#8230; How&#8217;s your ionized-diamond-cut-aluminium iPhone holding against finger nail damage?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still a poor choice using glass&#8230; Opinions shouldn&#8217;t change based on your favourite company starting to use it.</p>
<p>The issue was never with using glass. The problem was it broke&#8230; Google not only uses a much stronger version, but also has edges designed in a way that edge of glass isn&#8217;t exposed to the edge of the phone. Simples.</p>
<p>It was designed to break on a drop to dissipate the energy of the impact.  So not unexpected on the iphone, plus it was cheap and easy to replace.  I am curious how this will fare in drops.</p>
<p>Source?  Because nowhere have I ever seen Apple make that claim.</p>
<p>Sounds like his source is his bum. &#8220;It was designed to break&#8230;&#8221; No sorry,  breaking due to impact  energy isn&#8217;t a design feature, it&#8217;s a side-effect of too much impact energy.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s not an issue with using glass. Glass it very hard but also brittle, so it will be very resistant to scratches but also more likely to crack. I&#8217;d like to see tests because usually the process of making something harder also increases how brittle it is. We should also stop considering the materials we perceive to &#8216;feel better&#8217; in isolation from the intended use of the device. So a glass back will also be a negative for a phone even though it may look nice.</p>
<p>Glass is generally durable along two axis of it&#8217;s crystal structure.  It is, however, highly susceptible to edge impacts.  Having the edges protected on this phone will likely allow for far less breakage than bare-glass products such as the iphone.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s still not the best design material if durability is the goal, but obviously many people are more interested in things looking/feeling nice than they are them being durable.</p>
<blockquote>The issue was never with using glass. The problem was it broke… Google not only uses a much stronger version</blockquote>
<p>No, the iPhone 4 and 4S used Gorilla glass too.</p>
<p>Except this time it&#8217;s protected by the center frame.</p>
<p>I still say glass back is a bad idea. And I still really hope, that google will have more nexus phones, because I don&#8217;t like this one. I hope HTC or Sony will make a nexus.</p>
<p>I agree on Sony &#8211; they seem to be making the nicest looking android phones right now&#8230;</p>
<p>The Nexus 4- this design would have been boring 2 years ago. Today, it&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Weird &#8211; I really hate the Sony phones. Yuck!</p>
<p>Nope.  Glass back is still stupid.</p>
<p>Nope, I dislike it as much on this phone as I did on the iPhone.  Possibly more, since they had an example of what not to do beforehand.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t like glass, but for $350 off contract I don&#8217;t care, it&#8217;s still going to be very well made otherwise.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Gorilla Glass, not the same glass Apple used.</p>
<p>It begins&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple does not market it as such, but is most likely the same, as both are supplied by the same company.</p>
<p>Yes it is.</p>
<p>My problem with the glass back was that the edges of the glass were exposed on the iPhone, if you dropped it, the glass was likely to be the first to hit the floor.</p>
<p>The glass seems to be protected on the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>I always felt Glass on iPhone4,4s was one of the best design choices. It gave that phone a polished and premium look. Its implementation may have been a little flawed given that it used to crack more often than SGS2, but it was still a good decision. <br />
I am really looking forward to the drop-test of Nexus4.</p>
<p>It still sounds like an incredibly stupid idea, but hopefully they have learned from the iPhone 4 design failure and prevented the breakage problem. Duarte claims the housing protects the glass.</p>
<p>Oh hey look! it&#8217;s my next phone!</p>
<p>the design is definitely improved compared to the previous Galaxy Nexus. Overall, it looks like great hardware for those who want a terrific stock android experience.</p>
<p>Why do they offer 8gb phones anymore? It&#8217;s just not enough storage. Especially in a tablet. No LTE though could be a real deal breaker.</p>
<p>8GB is the deal breaker, for anyone wanting a decent mid-high end phone, they don&#8217;t give a damn about LTE.</p>
<p>Yes they do, 3G is basically what Edge was when HSPA+ was tops.  Go to an amusement park and enjoy your almost non-existent HSPA+ speeds because everyone is on their phones there, streaming media and/or uploading media to Facebook/Twitter/whatever.  It&#8217;s absolutely terrible.  LTE has not nearly those issues and it uses spectrum a lot more efficiently than HSPA+.</p>
<p>You can get an Xperia ion on AT&amp;T that has ICS and will get JB in due time and it has a 720p great screen, 16GB internal storage, SD Card, LTE, and 1900 mAh battery with HDMI Out, NFC, WiFi Direct, fast HSPA+ and LTE, the works&#8230;  All for $99 on contract.  Or the Xperia TL that&#8217;s coming out very soon which will be $99 on contract with even better hardware and a better camera.  Or the Atrix HD.  There are tons of choices for devices with expandable memory.  The fact that every OEM except HTC is adding SD Cards to their phones should give Google a clue.  If you want to get rid of SD Cards, you have to offer bigger storage SKUs.  Apple knows this, why can&#8217;t Google get it?</p>
<p> Normal consumers don&#8217;t care enough about Unlocked devices for that to matter, cause most of them don&#8217;t carrier hop.</p>
<p>Limited storage is bad.  1080p video is heavy.  Even 720p is decently heavy.  Pictures from an 8MP camera, if great quality, are like 3-3.5MB each.  That adds up fast.  Games can be huge.  There are Android games that download over a GB of storage.  Others that download 2-400MB of storage.   iOS users don&#8217;t have an issue with this, they can buy a 32/64GB iPhone (and they gladly pay the price for them) if they know they need a lot of storage.  Other Android devices the app can sideload all that data to a cheap 16GB SD Card you can get for $15 at Best Buy.  On a Nexus, you have to uninstall and make room.</p>
<p>Lastly, not everyone has a PC they carry with them everywhere (MacBook, Notebook, Ultrabook), or a tablet, and when your coverage drops Cloud Storage suddenly becomes useless.  There are millions of Windows Phone users with 25GB SkyDrive accounts for Life, and that debate was had for months on those forums.  Cloud storage is not a reliable fallback for real storage.  SD Cards are too cheap to not provide support for.  Sorry.</p>
<p>Your comparing an on-contract price to a off-contract price.</p>
<p>$99 on contract is much, much more expensive than the Nexus 4.</p>
<blockquote>Go to an amusement park and enjoy your almost non-existent HSPA+ speeds because everyone is on their phones there,</blockquote>
<p>How is that solved by LTE? If too many people would start using it then that too will be overloaded.</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s $299 unlocked with no contract. The Droid Razr Max HD is $299 on contract.</p>
<p>Does&#8217;t explain why there is no option above 16GB. A 64GB version at $400 would probably sell a bunch, and at a higher margin.</p>
<p>This is definitely my next. Suddenly my Note got really bulky and ugly.</p>

<p>How does the size of the Nexus 4 compare?</p>

<p>Sorry Fry, I&#8217;m gonna let you finish, but this is the best ShutUp &amp; Take My Money gif of all time!</p>
<p>$299 off contract? That&#8217;s cheaper than the Galaxy Nexus is right now! Wonder if the GN price will drop. Nuts!</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus will likely be discontinued.</p>
<p>no way.. why? just make it cheaper</p>
<p>Yeah just because this is coming out doesn&#8217;t mean Samsung will stop selling theirs.</p>
<p>Crazy price. I&#8217;m tempted to buy even though I&#8217;m very happy with the one X.</p>
<p>Finally Android fans will  stop complaining about glass backs.</p>
<p>And everything they ever said about them will be retconned.</p>
<p>lets wait to see how easily it breaks&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, if you&#8217;re trying to break it, it probably will.</p>
<p>Considering how much hate the N4 has already gotten, I think someone is just trolling (unoriginally I might add, considering this exact post was already posted.)</p>
<p>No, they will START doing so, before they had no reason to. It does look a little less fragile than the iPhone, though, as the glass on the back seems to be protected the plastic rim/frame.</p>
<p>The t-mobile version will only be available from t-mobile on contract?  Is that right?  Are there two different phones supporting different bands?</p>
<p>Might just be penta-band, although the original Galaxy Nexus was quad-band, with a penta-band version sold in play store.</p>
<p>This sounds more promising.</p>

<p>Nexus 4: 8GB for $299; 16GB for $349; available unlocked and without a contract on 11/13 on the Google Play store in U.S., U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Spain and Canada. The 16GB version will also be available through T-Mobile for $199, with a 2-year contract (check here for more details).</p>
<p>The price is a kick in the face for Apple!! I seriously didn&#8217;t expect this. I&#8217;ll keep my 4S for another year, but after that, I&#8217;ll have to think hard if I really want to spend 2x-3x as much!</p>
<p>Yeah,  this just goes to show the crazy margins other manufacturers have. But it&#8217;s supply and demand.</p>
<p>Not really, Apple wants to you know make money on the hardware.  They don&#8217;t sell services or data or ads like Google does.</p>
<p>Maybe you haven&#8217;t heard of iAd (<a href="http://advertising.apple.com/)" target="_blank">http://advertising.apple.com/)</a> but surely you&#8217;ve heard of iTunes and iCloud?</p>
<p>iTunes breaks even for apple.  They don&#8217;t push iAd very hard and iCloud is free for the vast majority unless you want more.</p>
<p>NDA!!! But woo guys! Great to see a pre-review so quick!</p>
<p>I know, we are totally unimportant, but what about Europe&#8230;?</p>
<p>And yeah, 16GB maximum&#8230; FU Google.</p>
<p>Engadget report it will be available in the UK.</p>

<p>£239 is a pretty unprecedented price. Very impressed.</p>
<p>£239 is a pretty unprecedented price. Very impressed.</p>
<p>Actually it&#8217;s £279 on google play store, still what a price!</p>
<p>Actually that&#8217;s for the 16gb version, it is £239!!!</p>
<p>bit confused about the Nexus branding &#8212; what is the difference as far as it being a &#8216;Nexus&#8217; between this and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus (which I thought for awhile now was the flagship device)?</p>
<p>Google provides updates, not the company that made it. Plain vanilla as it gets.</p>
<p>Oh and the Samsung Nexus was the flagship phone of Android Nexus line, until this beauty popped out.</p>
<p>The GNex was the flagship until this.  Nexus = pure Android, no skins, no bloatware, and updates from Google not carrier.</p>
<p>Plenty of Galaxy Nexuses get their updates from Samsung, sometimes with plenty of carrier intervention always with plenty of delays. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if LG is responsible for updating most Nexus 4s.</p>
<p>Not from the Play Store</p>
<p>Also theres only one version, for the whole world</p>
<p>Can their be a more perfect phone? I think not. $349 Unlocked 16GB Nexus 4, you are going to be mine shortly, HAHAHAHAHA</p>
<p>Lte</p>
<p>its shit.</p>
<p>One that doesn&#8217;t require me to buy new pants with bigger pockets.</p>
<p>Yes. Let me tell you, how: <br />
1&gt; Bump the internal memory by 16GB, more. <br />
2&gt; Add LTE<br />
3&gt; ???<br />
4&gt; Perfect Phone.</p>
<p>No, that ads $100 and it&#8217;s not needed.</p>
<p>this seriously pisses me off, like HSPA+ only, fuck you google.</p>
<p>Uh. Do you not understand why? They&#8217;re not working with carriers. They want a global phone instead of carriers getting in the middle. They are not competing with other oems</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to work with the carrier to get LTE working.</p>
<p>Yep. The GSM/HPSA/LTE stack is a universal standard.</p>
<p>Except LTE is absurdly fragmented.</p>
<p>Yes. Although many countries have worked hard to keep it consistant.</p>
<p>Except that LTE is mostly useless for the next 2 years. No VoLTE means it&#8217;s dumb having it.</p>
<p>Ironic considering all the android fans hating on Apple for not offering LTE..  Now it is ok though!</p>
<p>it&#8217;s ok because there&#8217;s 50 other android phones that do offer LTE.  Yeesh the whole point is that you have options with Android.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s &#8220;ok&#8221;? Having LTE that doesn&#8217;t do voice? Or having LTE that doesn&#8217;t really work on the standard bands? Or having LTE when there is no VoLTE with fallback to 3G?</p>
<p>Also notice the price of this device, compared to ~$700 for an iPhone5.</p>
<p>Yes you do as carriers use LTE on different spectrum. No chip exists with all of it combined.</p>
<p>YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES&#8230;..</p>
<p>It really really needs 32GB and LTE. I keep a phone for 2 years, its specs should stay relevant in that time period.</p>
<p>What we really need is unlimited data. Fast speeds are just a nice bonus.</p>
<p>Ah, I already have that :D</p>
<p>HSPA+ will see wider adoption in the next 2 years then LTE, so having a pentaband HSPA+ device makes much more sense.</p>
<p>Most countries that are rolling out LTE are rolling it out for mobile broadband, VoLTE is in it&#8217;s infancy.</p>
<p>When they say HSPA+, does that support T-Mobile&#8217;s 42Mbps version?  That would be nice.</p>
<p>DC-HSPA is 42Mbps, it may support it. But it might not.</p>
<p>Probably 21Mbps.</p>
<p>Yeah, the page on the Play Store says HSPA+ 21. Oh well.</p>
<p>Honestly, I get 10Mbps or more on the Gnex.  For the price, more than enough for me.  T-Mo is great.</p>
<p>Sounds like it&#8217;s about the same as the WiMax I have on Sprint now, then. I can live with that.</p>
<p>Odd, I see &#8220;HSPA+ 42&#8221; in the specs on the Play store.</p>
<p>Google made a mistake, updated the page this morning</p>
<p>Nice price. Well worthy to pick up even if u aren&#8217;t into android</p>
<p>As a Verizon customer whose been stuck on an HTC Thunderbolt for a year and a half and was looking forward to getting a Nexus with my upgrade in March, I&#8217;m pissed.  I guess I&#8217;m gonna end up beholden to OEM updates again (where the hell is my ICS upgrade, HTC?). Maybe I&#8217;ll just say screw it to the upgrade and pick up a used galaxy nexus.</p>
<p>Swappa.com , grab a GS3 is you want LTE and Verizon bands</p>
<p>Went from the Thunderbolt, which I got on a one year contract, to a Galaxy Nexus. I haven&#8217;t looked back. Off contract phones for the win.</p>
<p>&#8220;was looking forward to getting a Nexus with my upgrade in March&#8221;</p>
<p>What upgrade?  Verizon did away with those.  Instead you now have an &#8220;Upgrade Fee&#8221; of $30.  Why not just wait a few months and ditch Verizon?</p>
<p>it&#8217;s 299 bcuz its LG…smh</p>
<p>$349 for an unlocked phone with great processor and display is not a bad price but no LTE is a deal-breaker for me.</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT $299?</p>
<p>No LTE</p>
<p>This is completely inconsequential to me. I&quot;ve been using Sprint/Virgin Mobile for the past 3 years&#8230; 5Mbps compared to 0.5 Mbps I get now is MORE than enough.</p>
<p>And really, I don&#8217;t torrent or anything from my phone so I don&#8217;t need LTE speeds. HSPA+ for this cheap is a goddamn steal.</p>
<p>LTE is for those people who want to say &#8220;My phone can do LTE.&#8221;</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t used Verizon 3G much have you?  Besides, I lose my unlimited if I don&#8217;t buy unsubsidized on Verizon.   But they are making pretty damn sure that you will not be able to get a Nexus device at one of these price points off contract.  Wonder why they cant make a model with Verizon LTE radio.  Would buy it in a second since my DINC is getting old!</p>
<p>I think you hit it on the head.  Verizon doesn&#8217;t want a new Nexus on LTE because people will buy it unsubsidized to avoid having to upgrade to their shitty new plans.  If I can&#8217;t get a good unsubsidized phone when my GN unlimited contract is up, I will definitely buy an unlocked phone and move to Sprint or Tmobile.  Fuck Verizon.</p>
<p>&gt; No LTE</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Galaxy nexus: 2 year old HW. No LTE. $350<br />
iPhone 4: 2,5 year old HW. No LTE. $450<br />
iPhone 4S: 1 year old HW. No LTE. $550</p>
<p>Not a bad deal, is it?</p>
<p>My bad</p>
<p>GNex has CDMA sprint and Verizon LTE variants. However, the world GSM variant lacks LTE</p>
<p>$299</p>
<p>So November 13th availability &#8211; what about pre-orders?</p>
<p>I hope the HSDPA is pentaband</p>
<p>So do I.  Want to move to t-mobile but I do not want a contract.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the texture on the back? Why some photos show white dots and some is like plain black?</p>
<p>The glass is etched which is why the pattern only shows up at certain angles.</p>
<p>Might have to pick one of these up just to check it out how can you not for $299</p>
<p>This is Android&#8217;s iPhone 4. Glass backing, named Nexus 4, and gets lost in a bar.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t beat them, follow them, I guess&#8230;</p>
<p>This phone and Android 4.2 stomps all over the competition. What&#8217;s to beat?</p>
<p>My wallet is going to hate me soon lol.</p>
<p>Even though we knew about the 8gb and 16gb models, I fully expected the phone to start at $400 or $450.</p>
<p>Google just blew my mind.</p>
<p>SOILED IT!<br />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc5az5Kgde1qd8k9v.gif" /></p>
<p>haha you can buy two of these for the same price as ONE iPhone 5!</p>
<p>Yea but you still don&#8217;t have an iPhone</p>
<p>Social status is expensive.</p>
<p>And that is the only thing they can get a status. Sad.</p>
<p>I know. Isn&#8217;t it great?</p>
<p>RIP WP8</p>
<p>Its too early in the day for that.</p>
<p>I just want it on ATT $200 contract for 16gb :( my upgrade is next week. Already tired of my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket.</p>
<p>1. Use upgrade to buy a 16g iPhone 5, preferably white.<br />
2. Sell it. Ebay, Craigslist, Amazon, etc,.<br />
3. Use the proceeds to buy the unlocked version of the Nexus 4. You&#8217;d likely  profit on the whole deal besides the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>So instead of paying $200, take advantage of the Apple tax and Google discount all at the same time.</p>
<p>Well played Sir. Well played&#8230;.</p>
<p>Amazing price, I&#8217;m all over this.</p>
<p>I wonder if the Galaxy Nexus will still be available on the Play Store, and what the price will drop to&#8230;</p>
<p>At that price, pretty sure my GNex is worth next to nothing now. I&#8217;ll hold on to it till the new major release of Android 5.0 is announced with the Nexus 5&#8230;</p>
<p>Almost perfect Android phone for Europe. Low off-contract price and the lack of LTE doesn&#8217;t hurt as much here. Now if only it was a bit smaller and not built by LG&#8230;</p>
<p>If the hardware is great, why would it matter that it&#8217;s built by LG?</p>
<p>This not having SD card support (or at least 64GB of storage) kills the phone to me&#8230;well that and the fact it&#8217;s not coming to Verizon.</p>
<p>i dont think you would want a Nexus on verizon anyway</p>
<p>The lack of SD does suck, but I can see them not wanting to get in bed with Verizon again. They are way too uptight about letting through software updates.</p>
<p>I can feel Josh&#8217; happiness.</p>
<p><img src="http://goo.gl/H5G1H" /></p>
<p>Why glass back? I didn&#8217;t like that on iphone 4/4S&#8230; couldn&#8217;t they have used a light, thin brushed aluminum?</p>
<p>Rip apple with this price it is a no brainer</p>
<p>Lets hear all the android fans who bashed the iphone 4 and 4s for having a glass back claim glass backs are the greatest in the world.</p>
<p>How about let&#8217;s hear all the Apple fans who claimed that 3.5&quot; is the only acceptable screen size for a phone, eh?</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 4, like Android and think glass backs on phones SUCK.  Figure that one out.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3o6z7rSE91qgm59v.gif" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming the $299/$349 ones will be unlocked?</p>
<p>Unlocked off contract.</p>
<p>If they put a little more effort in the look of it, it would be a tough iPhone competitor.</p>
<p>What kind of speeds can I get on AT&amp;T with HSPA+?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten 10Mbps down, but upload speeds seem throttled on HSPA+.  Most times it&#8217;s about 3-4Mbps down and around 1Mbps up.  LTE in Baltimore or DC averages around 20Mbps down near tourist destinations and aroud 8-10Mbps up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten upwards of 30-52Mbps down in DC/Baltimore and over 15Mbps up on AT&amp;T LTE on my Skyrocket.  There&#8217;s simply no contest, especially if you like to share media on Social Networks like Facebook or Twitter (and especially if you share video).</p>
<p>The lack of LTE support is a big issue here, considering is a huge selling point for devices and networks.  I know people who switched from AT&amp;T to Verizon because Verizon has LTE support here and AT&amp;T&#8217;s is only coming &#8220;before the end of the year&#8221; for this area.</p>
<p>This is about the same as wimax on sprint. These speeds are more than fine for me. The real kicker for me is, what is your latency? (ping numbers)</p>
<p>i bought Galaxy Nexus at 350 thinking next Nexus would over 500-600. damn you Google/LG<br />
tho pretty awesome price for new Nexus considering that specs!</p>
<p>Somewhere in the loop, a man speaks these words aggressively while snapping his fingers, gesturing for things to happen at that moment, &#8220;I need an IP we can throw at it. Quick! Gimme one!&#8221;.</p>
<p>I kid. ;)</p>
<p>I was kinda hoping for the Nexus 4 to be bad so that it would be an easy decision to get the HTC 8x , but no this makes it tough. Especially since its coming to T-Mobile. Now its time to wait and watch this Windows Phone 8 press confrence and agonize over the choice&#8230;..</p>
<p>I was in the same boat as you, thinking the 8X would be a better value assuming the Nexus 4 would be like $599+. With the new features, $349 price, and HSPA+ (no LTE in my area) this is a steal</p>
<p>No LTE. lmfao</p>
<p>Because HSPA is soooooooo slow.</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2734617/Screenshot_2012-10-29-16-33-22.png" /></p>
<p>That upload speed is slow.  LTE upload speed can be twice as fast as that download speed, and the download speed can be 4x as high in some areas/conditions.  Yes, when you&#8217;ve experienced LTE speeds, especially for media consumption (and especially large HD-type media consumption, and ESPECIALLY if you&#8217;re tethering other device formfactors to your phone like Notebooks and Tablet PCs) the HSPA+ speeds feel slow compared to LTE.</p>
<p>HSPA+ speeds are not consistently that high for most people, but LTE speeds are consistently higher than HSPA+ speeds on both the up and downlink for pretty much everyone, even with a ton of LTE phones in the area using the network.  Go to a busy tourist destination with an HSPA+ device and see how crippled the network becomes.</p>
<p>Yes LTE has better bandwidth management so when under heavy strain can still provide consistant speeds. But for most the population in developed countries, HSPA+ is enough.</p>
<p>Most people&#8217;s home Internet is probably slower. Time Warner&#8217;s second-fastest plan is 5 up, 30 down.</p>
<p>Futureproofing, anyone?</p>
<p>As LTE gradually takes the weight, HSPA+ is going to get faster!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to affectionately call this the mullet phone.  Business in front, party in the back.</p>
<p>Wow, that is an amazing price! I was interested on getting a Nexus 7, but this looks so much better!</p>
<p>No LTE? Really?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit odd that with my galaxy nexus I don&#8217;t feel the urge to go out and buy a new phone everytime one gets announced, I think I&#8217;m&#8230; Satisfied?</p>
<p>Settled. Never settle dude.</p>
<p>Sell your current and get this one. N4 is practically future update proofed with those specs.</p>
<p>Ass soon as I see that my nexus wont get the latest update I will. But I think  might be getting the nexus 10, now that Samsung has stopped updating the original galaxy tab 10.1.</p>
<blockquote>N4 is practically future update proofed with those specs. <strong>Except LTE.</strong></blockquote>
<p>FTFY.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re probably growing up&#8230;lol.</p>
<p>Price is incredible. But with a 2100 mAh battery, I&#8217;ll have to wait for the tests. I&#8217;ve been stung before by the GNex.</p>
<p>If anyone is in the Seattle area, I&#8217;d love to know what kind of speeds you generally get with T-Mobile HSPA. I&#8217;m thinking about ditching Verizon for comparison. I&#8217;m on the Eastside most of the time (Redmond, Kirkland,Bothell).</p>
<p>in generally 9-16Mbps down, or about as fast as AT&amp;T&#8217;s newly launched LTE here. I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve recently tested speeds on the eastside though, I don&#8217;t ever go to the suburbs. If anything I&#8217;d imagine they might be a bit better.</p>
<p>Honestly, that&#8217;s about what I get with Verizon LTE now. Sometimes it&#8217;ll spike pretty high, but it&#8217;s not something to count on.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know latency times? Verizon is pretty good, it&#8217;s rare to see it over 100ms, most of the time it&#8217;s around 60ish.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of switching my everyday phone over to that $30 TMobile plan and just keeping my mobile hotspot on Verizon mainly for the data coverage. Looking like I shouldn&#8217;t have much of an issue.</p>
<p>Where do I sign up?</p>
<p>Wonder if the Tmo version will be 32GB. If not, id rather buy it unlocked.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re on Verizon Wireless, no Nexus 4&#8230;. :-(</p>
<p>95% of the world won&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>After what they did to the GNex, completely understandable.</p>
<p>with just 16gb of storage this thing is dead on arrival. i have just that much in pictures. not to mention apps and music. and no cloud storage is not a viable option when traveling (try accessing your files while flying over the pacific).</p>
<p>Then get something else. I&#8217;ll be getting two of these anyway.</p>
<p>Welcome to 2011.</p>
<p>My Next Device!!!!!</p>
<p>NOT</p>
<p>shit wait so no AT&amp;T or Verizon support? :(</p>
<p>It works on AT&amp;T, just not on LTE.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there will be a white version?</p>
<p>It says £279, not £269</p>
<ul>
	<li>wrong thread</li>
</ul>
<p>duh!</p>
<p>Wondering the same thing, mention of it seems to have been lost with all the hype surrounding the price.</p>
<p>£269 for 16GB Here in the UK. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_16gb" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_16gb</a> That is incredible.</p>
<p>Amazing price for a smartphone, but lack of storage.</p>
<p>such a bargain and this could tempted me away from a WP8 device.</p>
<p>It says £279, not £269</p>
<p>Dear Google, I would have paid 499 for the 16gb version, but whatever I&#8217;ll get one for me and my girlfriend:)</p>
<p>Any news on a white version?</p>
<p>Humm, i dont think there is going to be a N4 black, all Nexus&#8217; product line aesthetics is based on plain black.</p>
<p>There was mention of it <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/10/3482664/lg-nexus-4-carphone-warehouse-listing">previously</a>. It would be nice to have the choice the the plain unbroken black front is really nice</p>
<p>Sigh &#8230;..<br />
No LTE, I&#8217;ll stick with my gNexus and start looking elsewhere  :-(<br />
<em>Lack of LTE is a deal breaker.</em></p>
<p>What type of SIM card does it take?!</p>
<p>UTMS SIM Cards.</p>
<p>But Micro-SIM.</p>
<p>Looks bang average. And it says LG on it.</p>
<p>A Tmobile version?  can someone explain to me what this means?</p>
<p>If I buy a unlocked phone directly from Google it wont run on Tmo?</p>
<p>Cause I own a Galaxy Nexus and I&#8217;m on Tmobile, as soon as I read this phone was gonna start at 300, I definetly said It was gonna be a buy,  but  does this mean I need to buy one on contract for Tmobile? or can I just buy the one directly from Google?  I&#8217;m sure as hell not extending my contract.</p>
<p>It will run on T-Mo from the play store, they&#8217;re just giving the option to go on contract because that&#8217;s the way the US does it.  Much better deal to buy it unlocked.</p>
<p>oh yeah I know, but it just worried me, as it is the phone is a marvel, it would have been a bummer if I had to get a contract to use it on Tmo.</p>
<p>thanks, btw</p>
<p>How does T-mobile do their wifi calling?  Does it just work w/ unlocked phones on their network, or do you have to be under contract w/ their equipment to use it?</p>
<p>I believe the Wifi-Calling I believe it has to be just with there equipment seeing that I owned a Galaxy Vibrant and a Sidekick 4G from them and where the only devices to have the App, while the Galaxy nexus I ordered didnt have it, despite using it under there network,  then again I think you can download it on the Play Store.</p>
<p>Price is unreal!!!</p>
<p>Hey, I&#8217;ve been wanting an Android device but I already have an iPhone on contract. Does it make sense to buy this unlocked and then use it as an iPod-touch like thing, or will that not work?</p>
<p>That would work, no problem.  If you&#8217;re on a GSM carrier, you could also swap your sim and try it as your phone for the day if you want!</p>
<p>Wow, putting it that way, this thing puts the actual iPod Touch to shame. Looks like Google actually might be &#8220;bringing their A-game&#8221;</p>
<p>Definitely worth a try at this price.  Jellybean is already outstanding, and 4.2 looks even moreso.  Can&#8217;t wait to get it on my Gnex.</p>
<p>not with the low amount of storage, but maybe buy this one, and use your iphone as an ipod-touch like thing.</p>
<p>My money is on Google doing the same thing to the Nexus 4 6 months down the road they did with the Nexus 7.  They&#8217;ll upgrade the storage capacity and keep the price the same.</p>
<p>That said, I don&#8217;t think I can wait 6 months, so I&#8217;m in for that price!</p>
<p>The placeholder site on Google Play is up. Says 21Mbps HSPA+, which is a minor bummer.</p>
<p>Wow wow wow. This thing makes me kind of sad that I jut bought an iPhone 5. Oh well. I guess there&#8217;s always the Nexus 5!</p>
<p>&#8230;or you could just sell it on eBay and have money left over after buying this.</p>
<p>But that would require you to actually own a iPhone 5 when we all know you just said that for dramatic internet effect.</p>
<p>Glass back: check<br />
No SD card: check<br />
No removable battery: check<br />
No LTE: check<br />
New proprietary HDMI connector: check</p>
<p>Oh god the Android fans will have a field day over this. Oh wait, IT IS Android and the flagship, no less. I sense those will all be acceptable (even desired) features now.</p>
<p>less 300$ ?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference between Android fans and Nexus fans.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t be getting this phone because I still think that non-removable batteries are dumb and making the thing out of glass is also dumb.II&#8217;m happy with my Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t think the slimport hdmi is proprietary.</p>
<p>This type of trolling is getting really boring. Stop those lame assumptions.</p>
<p>sorry, replied to wrong post</p>
<p>You know what would be epic? Worldwide release of the NEXUS where the manufacturer already has a market. I&#8217;d love to get it in Argentina or at least if i manage to get it via a friend or buying it on eBay, have at least a year of warranty for the hardware.</p>
<p>Google Play might not be selling it in your country, but that does not stop Amazon or local retailers/operators from stocking it.</p>
<p>For the Galaxy Nexus it was sold on Amazon etc before it was sold on Google Play.</p>
<p>Amazon doesn&#8217;t seem to like doing business with Latin America. Your best bet is eBay, but again, when the Galaxy Nexus was released, it cost $800 more to get it there.</p>
<p>This device looks amazing. I want it so bad, and it&#8217;s really cheap for the hardware it is offering.<br />
The 16Gb version is very atractive. However, I already added a 16Gb microSD card to my SGS2 so I don&#8217;t know how I would live without less than 32Gbs.</p>
<p>So let me get this straight.. the flagship Nexus device being released November 2012 doesn&#8217;t support LTE? And all the trolls who bashed and mocked the iPhone 4S released last year for not having LTE as being &#8216;useless&#8217; and &#8216;years behind&#8217; are now coming up with justification for the new Nexus phone not having it? Unreal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading on Twitter some saying no LTE is actually good since it saves battery!</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, iPhone fans with an iPhone pre-5 used the exact same argument when all the Android fans made fun of the iPhone because it didn&#8217;t have LTE. Things like &#8220;I&#8217;d rather have long battery life instead of a phone that dies in 4 hours&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yeah, fandroids are shameless. They are turning the small memory,  lack of LTE and the lack of a micro SD slot into features!</p>
<p>I think the more important thing to remember here is that people who need LTE can get LTE on a different device.  Yes some Android fans levied this argument, but each side has really had to walk some things back, so lets stop focusing on the past and talk about now.</p>
<p>Plus you never know if Verizon decides they want a LTE Nexus 4</p>
<p>Would like to know how android fans react to the front and back glass cover. They were defending gnex&#8217;s plastic and attacking I phone&#8217;s glass. Now what are there stances?</p>
<p>Wait so on contract it&#8217;s only a $100 subsidy? that&#8217;s kinda crazy shitty. Good on them making a $299 off contract phone (though no LTE is enough for me to give it a no) But a 2 year contract for $100 less? Hopefully no one does that.</p>
<p>Ha, this is America.  It will be done.  Of course, it might be the 16 gig one, but still a super shitty deal on contract.</p>
<p>i hope it&#8217;s the 16, closer to &#8220;acceptable&#8221;</p>
<p>This is Google&#8217;s attempt to lure in the magpies (or sheeps) that get excited with shiny and reflective (read: Glass) things.</p>
<p>Loving the $299 off contract. I hope this trend continues and we get $199 unlocked phones.. $199 on contract / $299 off leaves no reason to sign a 2 year contract with any of these piece of shit carries in the US. Love it.</p>
<p>I think THIS IS MY NEXT PHONE, that is if it&#8217;s available in my country soon enough.</p>
<p>They are working hard to get it to more territories. They have been for they past several years. Actually, I think they are slacking off.</p>
<p>Price is awesome although max 16gb storage with no SD support and no LTE is what you get which are not appropriate in a flagship device in my opinion. Google is really trying to take all the attention from Win 8/WP8. Considering how google screwed up with managing the s/w updates, I think android will start losing market share to WP8.  Just my opinion</p>
<p>I disagree, some things are a lot more important than LTE, like What ecosystem you prefer to be in.  The Nexus device is a flagship device, but it is also a developer device, and it has always been one.</p>
<p>The problem is twofold.  In not having LTE, it actually makes more sense if the Nexus 4 were to come with higher storage capacity (at least 64GB) so that you don&#8217;t have to rely entirely to streaming audio/video which would be hell without LTE.  Not being able to store a lot media on the phone requires fast connection i.e.. LTE.  The problem with the Nexus 4 is that it sits in the purgatory of slow connection and low storage.  Which is why I think the low price is more than appropriate.</p>
<p>Since when was HSPA+ not enough to stream music and standard def video? The only reason you&#8217;d need LTE is if you really want to stream HD video or download large files very quickly. I stream Pandora on the highest bitrate even with only 2 bars of signal on HSPA+&#8230;  I can watch SD YouTube with little to no time spent buffering. I can even use the &#8220;HQ&#8221; setting on the YouTube app and the buffering moves more than 2X as fast as the playback. (All this without even full signal on HSPA+.)</p>
<p>I do wish that we could get a Nexus phone like this one with a larger storage capacity, micro SD, and LTE. However, that being said, this phone is simply as good or better than any other Android phone on the market as long as you don&#8217;t absolutely need LTE (which almost no one does) and if you don&#8217;t need a ton of storage space (which some people do, but not most average users.) If they are wanting this device to sell to the masses, then it seems likely they sacrificed the least important features (extremely important to some of us, but not so important to the masses) in order to make the phone inexpensive and still cutting edge.</p>
<p>Not dissimilar to the Nexus 7&#8217;s model. (Affordable but clean and powerful at the cost of some generally less important but cool features [camera, sd, capacity].)</p>
<p>That price is incredible.  Kudos to Google for pulling that one off.</p>
<p>Glass front and rear?!?  Thats so Apple like to pick form over function and pull this!!!<br />
-Every Android fan circa 2010</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to hear it now&#8230;(actually I can because I know those same detractors will praise it now that Google is doing it)</p>
<p>From what I remember the issue with Apples glass back was that it shattered seemingly very easily&#8230; if this phone&#8217;s glass back doesn&#8217;t then it&#8217;s no longer a form over function argument.</p>
<p>Haha these comments are hilarious. Why is it that every mobile device article is riddled with you childish tools? You guys act like you personally made any of these devices. Grow up.</p>
<p>Is it gonna be available on sprint??</p>
<p>Not that they&#8217;ve announced.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s unlocked pentaband; you can buy it and just toss in a sim card and it <strong>will</strong> work on Sprint or T-Mobile; just no Verizon it would seem&#8230; as has been the case with every other phone sold through the play store.</p>
<p>It will not work on Sprint. They won&#8217;t activate any phone they have not approved. They use a similar process to Verizon. Their rule (from their FAQ and customer service handbook) is &#8220;If it doesn&#8217;t have the Sprint logo on it, we won&#8217;t activate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran into that problem earlier this year when I wanted to get a Galaxy Nexus from Verizon and activate it on Sprint. I asked them and they flat out said they would never do it.</p>
<p>$299?? Pinch me I must be dreaming!!! I don&#8217;t care if it is 8GB. That is an incredible price for a high end Nexus device with the latest version of Android, with no custom UIs and guarenteed to be upgradeable to at least Android 4.4. Google I love you!! lol</p>
<p>I would be all over this&#8230;but I&#8217;m on Verizon.  #GalaxyNexus I&#8217;m crying on the inside</p>
<p>I would seriously be thinking about buying one of these if it supported LTE.  Alas.</p>
<p>Hey, there&#8217;s a Windows Phone event going on live. LOL</p>
<p>yea lol, Im going there to see what they have to offer.</p>
<p>Oh my&#8230; they should have kept the Galaxy Nexus and sold that for $249 :D</p>
<p>Clearance price $199?</p>
<p>$349 with 16GB&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://http://www.myfacewhen.net/uploads/3638-i-came.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/PoiS3.jpg" /></p>
<p>so much nexus porn on the verge today&#8230;</p>
<p>To all iPhone fans rubbing us the fact that has not removable battery, no LTE and glass backplate, YOU ARE RIGHT. But this phone is like, 300 USD less unlocked than the iPhone.</p>
<p>it also looks like it costs $300 less than the iPhone</p>
<p>How does that even make sense! :D</p>
<p>That is like trying to explain why you think blue is better than orange, to someone who loves orange! :D</p>
<p>Are you also the type who buys everything Gucci makes? :D Because it has that extra edge on fashion?</p>
<p>Sounds to me like you are owned by consumerism. ;)</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>wait.. Glass back? No LTE and only 8GB? Wasn&#8217;t that the Android hateraid being thrown at the 4s? Now it&#8217;s awesome?  I get it..</p>
<p>No, you don&#8217;t. You are referring to $650 phone with 3.5&quot; screen.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait til Nov. 13!  Give it to me now!</p>
<p>Blasted Verizon contract.</p>
<p>As an owner of 2 Nex7&#8217;s, and someone who&#8217;s bought most of the flagship phones on release day, I&#8217;m sorry but there is no way possible to make this phone look good.  No LTE is unfathomable.  Even at that unlocked price point, this is a niche phone not intended for mass consumption.  Seriously, a big time letdown and step backwards.  WP8, here I come.</p>
<p>Great. But watch your steps.</p>
<blockquote>Even at that unlocked price point, this is a niche phone not intended for mass consumption.</blockquote>
<p>Congratulations, this is the truth. Stick with your contract carrier bloated OEM skinned phones(Some of them are very nice). I&#8217;ll stick with the niche product. That will have better support(firmware wise at least).</p>
<p>Damnit Google, the only time you have my attention as a possible future customer that wants to upgrade to a device that he won&#8217;t be afraid of dropping on the floor and shattering glass both on the back and front (yes, I have an iPhone 4), and you introduce a phone with&#8230; glass on the back and front. Damn you Google, just damn you.</p>
<p>Joking aside, I really hope the camera is good&#8230; at least as good as the iPhone 4&#8217;s. If it is lacking in that aspect, my interest for this device will be greatly diminished.</p>
<p>Will this work on t-mobile prepay?  The wife has a vibrant (Galaxy S) and if I could buy this off contract and use it on her current prepay account, that would be golden.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t give a damn if it doesn&#8217;t have LTE, I&#8217;m perfectly willing to compromise for price and battery power. All I have to do is use my wifi if I want to download something intense anyway. 299 is a steal!</p>
<p>But will it be sold here in Brazil?<br />
If so, will it be called &#8220;Google X4&#8221;, &#8220;LG Optimus X4&#8221; (Google is yet to reach an agreement with the local owner of the &#8220;Nexus&#8221; trademark) or they&#8217;ll find a way and call it the &#8220;Nexus 4&#8221;?</p>
<p>Probably only in next year. I&#8217;m stop to wait the Nexus 7, but Nexus 4 probably will land here! (i&#8217;m brazillian too!)</p>
<p>Considering LG&#8217;s prominent position in the Brazilian cellular market, I wonder if they could handle the distribution here? I hope so!</p>
<p>But who would update the Nexus 4/Google X4/Optimus X4/whatever it&#8217;s called? Google or LG? (Samsung updates the Galaxy Nexus &#8211; sorry, &#8220;Galaxy X&#8221; &#8211; sold here)</p>
<p>While I love to have a pure Google experience, what am I missing out on by getting this over a Galaxy S3 other than LTE (which isn&#8217;t in my area anyway)? I&#8217;ve looked, but don&#8217;t see any downside to the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>16GB storage is not alot.</p>
<p>No LTE. No SD card. Deal breaker. For me. But like Miracast.</p>
<p>I hoped that a new Nexus device might make me switch from Windows Phone. I was even ready to forgo my ecosystem for it. I might need to stick with 920 or 8x or if I&#8217;m more adventurous S III.</p>
<p>Looks like a great phone and the screen alone would make it a worthy upgrade to my Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>That said, the most enjoyable part of this announcement will be watching everyone scramble to spin their positions on non-removable batteries, glass backs and LTE. ;-)</p>
<p>The Google apologists out in force defending this fairly middling phone are pretty hilarious.</p>
<p>16GB max storage &#8211; Why on earth would anyone need more?<br />
LTE &#8211; Who needs that kind of speed?</p>
<p>You could say its a price compromise.<br />
But too much fanboyism is bad for everyone.</p>
<p>Depends on the person.  Many people use cloud storage and other options so honestly 16GB is enough.  I don&#8217;t have any media on my Galaxy Nexus because majority of it resides in the cloud with the exception of playlist I keep cached on the phone.  Google is pushing cloud services so they are basically saying way pay more for space when majority of what you need is in the cloud?</p>
<p>They couldn&#8217;t make this argument 2 years back because that simply was not the case.  Their cloud services are not what they are now.</p>
<p>I have a 32 GB phone and I only use 8GB  that includes about 5 games 3 playlist of about 50 songs each and about 90+ other apps.  So do I need 32GB on my Phone. No between my Phone and Tablet 16GB on each device is just fine for me.  But thats me.</p>
<p>No LTE &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m happy there&#8217;s no LTE. HDSPA is good enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>8GB &amp; 16GB only &#8211; &#8220;Why do you need more than 16GB?&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments here are delightful.<br />
Who&#8217;s the sheep now..?</p>
<p>Well to be fair,  the positives about this phone greatly outweigh the negatives. And contrary to positive belief, some people actually don&#8217;t need more than 16gb of memory ,  others have wifi in the majority of the places they go.</p>
<p>Just being fair!</p>
<p>No LTE: &#8230; LTE is basically carrier specific, so I see why they didn&#8217;t include it. With the LTE GN it was never a true nexus phone because of proprietary LTE radios. Upadtes had to go through Verizon.<br />
8GB &amp; 16GB only: Money talks.</p>
<p>No LTE is a deal breaker for me.</p>
<p>£279 + no proper LTE in the UK yet anyway = SOLD!</p>
<p>HSPA+ is ok with me. =) Say goodbye to iPhone 5 and other devices out there!!!! Good Job Google! More people will sport a Nexus device by 2013 and that&#8217;s for sure!!!</p>
<p>Before anyone puts in any more snarky comment the lack of LTE, please consider the following:</p>
<p>1. The phone is unlocked and has pentaband HSPA+. It will give you decent data speed on virtually any GSM carrier around the world.<br />
2. Its price tag &#8211; $349 for a top-of-the-line spec phone. Find me another phone with comparable spec as the Nexus 4 at this price range.</p>
<p>I think this openness and freedom is more in line with the Nexus’ brand spirit than some shackle you have to put up with for LTE access. It’s not that Google didn’t bother &#8211; they tried working with carriers to include LTE on their devices and it was such a mess (pointing finger at Verizon).</p>
<p>People who benefit for from pentaband access and (relatively) cheap price will grossly outnumber people to whom the lack of LTE is a deal breaker. Think of developing markets like India or Asia and the huge potential this phone has if Google manages to bring it there. FYI, there’s more to the world that NYC, Chicago or San Francisco.</p>
<p>It’s clear that the Nexus 4 is NOT the device for everyone, and it wasn’t designed to be such a device. Remember, Nexus line is to showcase Google’s vision and strategy for their mobile devices, not spec-monsters. There’s always the Samsung Galaxy S3 or even the coming-soon S4 that I’m sure will check all the right boxes for most people. Designing a consumer electronic device is all about choosing between compromises. I think with its strategy and brand image, Google chose the right ones with the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>Sorry, but you&#8217;re an apologist fanboi.  I am a business owner with Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7 and overall huge Nexus supporter.  I am ready to upgrade and have been waiting patiently for today&#8217;s announcement.  There is no way I can go backwards and get a phone- no matter how good it is- without LTE.  I had the Thunderbolt on the first day and the same as the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 7.</p>
<p>This is a totally ridiculous development and Andy Rubin should be fired.  In fact, I can&#8217;t believe they would take this step backwards in announcing this phone.  I am going to have to adopt a different ecosystem now after 4 years of droid because of their no LTE support.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, many people will not switch from Verizon and LTE no matter how great the hardware is.</p>
<p>Nobody forces you to switch from Verizon and LTE. Unlike Apple&#8217;s iPhone, the Nexus phone isn&#8217;t the only option on the market you if want an Android device. It seems the Galaxy S3 or RAZR HD has everything you need. Or you can wait for the Galaxy S4 or something from HTC.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen or touched the Nexus 4 in person yet so I can&#8217;t comment on how great the hardware is. I don&#8217;t work for Google so I don&#8217;t know what their strategy is either. One thing I do know is that with the $349 price tag, Google clearly is not interested in the spec race and first-world consumers who MUST have super-fast internet are not their primary target.<br />
I&#8217;m sorry Google and you don&#8217;t see eye-to-eye. Perhaps you can take the consolation in knowing that lots of people in developing nations will rejoice at the chance for an affordable, quality smartphone? And developers who write the apps that you use everyday will be glad they don&#8217;t have to shell out an arm and a leg on a 2 year bondage for a testing device?</p>
<blockquote>lots of people in developing nations will rejoice</blockquote>
<p>Like in UK for instance, where we don&#8217;t really have LTE, but we do have lots of HSPA+, which is plenty fast enough for me.</p>
<p>No microSD card slot? I assume you can&#8217;t swap a battery yourself? =(<br />
I don&#8217;t want a phone made of glass, I want something powerful, durable, and customizable! That&#8217;s WHY I went with android, the promise of open source.<br />
What I&#8217;m wanting is the hardware to match the software, and with each new android phone I feel like the hardware side is straying further from that open ideal. Despite this being an unlocked phone, it still feels like it has limits it shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you know what open source means. Everything in a Nexus Phone is open source.. down to the chipset and radios. If it&#8217;s not open source, then it&#8217;s not a Nexus phone. Compromises on hardware (SD slot, Battery) are not going against open source.</p>
<p>That is not true.  There are parts that are not open source for various reasons including licensing and proprietary tech.  A lot is open sourced though.</p>
<p>Google must have more up their sleeves I can feel it</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite familiar with the whole unlocked phone business, so pardon my curiosity.  Currently on VZ with GNex for starters.  Let&#8217;s say I wanted to purchase the 16g from the Play Store, what would I do next?  At&amp;t has the 2nd best coverage where I live (VZW 1st), so what would I have to do to get this phone working on their network?</p>
<p>go get (activate) an ATT sim card from the store and put it in your phone.</p>
<p>Is there a no-contract plan at AT&amp;T that doesn&#8217;t screw me over for bringing my own phone?</p>
<p>Unfortunately no. There&#8217;s no such thing as &#8220;no-contract plan&#8221; at AT&amp;T. You&#8217;d still be paying the same as someone who bought a subsidized phone.<br />
They do have prepaid plans, but those are meant for feature phones. You&#8217;d be paying like $40/month extra for 2GB of data, which brings the monthly cost close to that of the regular post-paid plan.<br />
Your best bet would be this: StraightTalk &#8211; $45/month for unlimited everything.<br />

StraightTalk uses AT&amp;T network so you&#8217;d be getting the same coverage as you would on AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>The 8gb is apparently £239 off contract for us in the UK. If true that&#8217;s an amazing price :)</p>
<p>That price is correct. It&#8217;s insane and this is my next.</p>
<p>This is pretty sad. I have a Galaxy Nexus for Verizon. And now I know that it&#8217;s no longer coming to Verizon, it makes me want to switch carriers. I&#8217;m a bit sad. I won&#8217;t lie</p>
<p>Yep, been waiting for this announcement, saw the price and was happy, now I&#8217;m let down.  What a surprise that Verizon wont offer this off contract at this price.  Then again maybe its Googles fault and not Verizon, just used to Verizon screwing customers.</p>
<p>even with the low storage space, what i see as the only drawback of this device, you gotta be mental to ignore this thing</p>
<p>I have been very pleased with the Galaxy Nexus, and the Nexus 4 looks to be another winner.  I am bummed about the headphone jack on top, though, and also wondering if this has USB MHL for HDMI output like the GNex?</p>
<p>Also LOVE having multiple batteries for my GNEX.</p>
<p>Just tell me, is it really $299 unlocked and without any contract or I am dreaming?</p>
<p>You are not dreaming, sir.  Google has caused some sort of paradigm shift with these EXTREMELY reasonable unlocked phone prices.  Heads&#8212;&gt;Explode</p>
<p>I think it is a bit early to state they have done a paradigm shift.  This is one phone that was just released.  They tried this before and failed and in doing so helped strengthen the carriers.   We will see if they can do something this time.</p>
<p>well, its a step in the right direction. <br />
google doenst like carriers, at least in the US, and here in EU the vast majority of consumers buy an unlocked phone and only AFTERWARDS they decide wich carrier to go with, according to their offers.</p>
<p>No one, before Google, with the Galaxy Nexus, and now the Nexus 4 have ever priced high-end phones at reasonable, not-greater-than-double-digit-percent-markup prices before.  That is the <em>shift</em> I am referring to.<br />
For example check out these great similarly priced off- contract phones ! (available today!): <br />
<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&&action=viewPhoneDetail&&selectedPhoneId=5949" target="new">Samsung Galaxy Stellar $329.99</a><br />
<a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/controller?item=phoneFirst&action=viewPhoneDetail&selectedPhoneId=5714" target="new">LG Enlighten $329.99</a><br />

<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16875176354" target="new">Samsung Galaxy Ace $289.99</a></p>
<p>All joking aside, im glad they(Google) have gone forth with this pricing scheme.</p>
<p>I wonder if I wait till Christmas the 8gb version will be discontinued, the 16gb will cost $299 and a new 32gb one for $349?</p>
<p>WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!! 300$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the 32gb version?! x_x</p>
<p>So I can get a top-end HSPA+ Android device for $299 off-contract, and then pair it with Simple Mobile for a $50/month 4G unlimited everything plan. Sounds like a winner.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t have 4G.  If there&#8217;s a cheaper 3G plan you&#8217;d be better to go with that.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s Nexus 3?!?!</p>
<p>Honestly, I think this is fantastic &#8211; extremely reasonable price to give a nice upgrade to the Gnex, fix its camera, upgrade the screen, add battery life, and continue on into the next generation of software.  I&#8217;ll be right in line to pick one up at launch.   I&#8217;m most certainly willing to trade LTE for a lack of carrier bullcrappery.</p>
<p>Any mention of the type of SIM used for this device?</p>
<p>probably a micro sim.</p>
<p>That Eastern European article (can&#8217;t remember the country) about this phone showed it being a micro-SIM.</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m getting this .</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230; only 16gb and no LTE?  I was hoping this would finally be the perfect Nexus phone, but it just isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I am sure there will be a Sprint version next spring if you really want LTE.</p>
<p>November 13th cannot come soon enough! I want this! Don&#8217;t need LTE when your on t-mobile!</p>
<p>Funny how a glass back and no LTE suddenly turn into &#8220;features&#8221; when the new Nexus comes out</p>
<p>Argh, no LTE!! Not even for more money!?</p>
<p>I was really really excited about this phone &#8211; day one purchase sort of thing &#8211; and now I&#8217;m hesitating. LTE just launched in my area and I typically buy a phone every two or three years. Do I really want to be stuck without LTE for the next two years? Bah.</p>
<p>$350 16 GB off contract? With a 720p IPS screen? S4 Pro? 2 GB of RAM? An updates on a timely manner?</p>
<p>Freaking awesome. The lack of LTE isn&#8217;t the best around, but I guess Google doesn&#8217;t want to love Verizon&#8217;s BS again, and since most of the world lacks LTE, not to mention most of the US, it shouldn&#8217;t matter much except in a few places.</p>
<p>IPS Screen OMFG, just like my color accurate HP Lp2475W!!</p>
<p>The galaxy nexus has a so so screen? In your review you loved the screen Josh. The screen is great on the galaxy nexus!</p>
<p>That was a while ago&#8230; But yeah, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s all the fuss about screens. If I can see it, it&#8217;s good enough!</p>
<p>So this is available for $299 unlocked and without contract? Is that right?</p>
<p>I love how angry and stompy people are getting&#8230; &#8220;I WANT 128GB AND LTE AND 10 INCH SCREENS AND I DON&#8217;T WANT TO PAY FOR ANY OF IT!!!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Great looking phone, at an awesome price. Way to go Google!</p>
<p>Dat Price!</p>
<p>I hope the euro price does not come with the same &#8220;f*** you&#8221; factor as the nexus7 ($200&#8594;€250).<br />
Otherwise this device could be my next, replacing my iPhone4 for at least a year. (Lumia920 is another option but thats twice the price of this) Although I find it ugly but I care more for what&#8217;s on the screen anyway. (I never really liked the iPhone4(s) design either)</p>
<p>Anyone who complains about this is insane. $350&#8230; for the fastest processor in the market, the second fastest GPU, a high end IPS 720p screen (is a tiny bit more in fact), 16 GB, pleasant design (I just hope the back doesn&#8217;t shatter easily), all for 350 off contract?</p>
<p>Really, are you really complaining? LTE is only useful in a fraction of the world, and while in that fraction the lack of LTE is important, it isn&#8217;t in the rest of the world, and the phone is $350.</p>
<p>Get some fucking perspective people, that&#8217;s $50 more than the iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Yeah, but is it comming to the rest of the world or just to that fraction of the world where LTE is a fact?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good question.</p>
<p>16GB is just not usable.  I&#8217;ll be skipping this for a note II.  I would have happily paid a little more for 32GB or 64, but 16 won&#8217;t do.</p>
<p>16 GB is livable. I would&#8217;ve paid 50 or 100 extra if I could get an extra 16 GB. But I&#8217;ll buy this anyway, the hardware is just too good, and the updates will always come in a timely matter.</p>
<p>my current phone has 16GB and I don&#8217;t have even a quarter of what I want to put on it.</p>
<p>make that I have 24GB- 16 on SD and 8 internal, so I&#8217;m sure as hell not going backwards.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not arguing about you, you&#8217;re just one users, and nobody designs products for you.</p>
<p>16 GB is definitively livable as it&#8217;s the memory capacity of the most successful phone out there (the iPhone).</p>
<p>I also have 24 that I filled, but I can live with uninstalling games (those things, in my case, are the ones that suck the most memory)</p>
<p>Google with their hoard of engineers are like a freight train just picking up speed. Innovation seemed slow at first, but now it appears that the weight of Google is completely behind Android and the rate of improvement is getting faster and faster.</p>
<p>I barely have T-Mobile coverage where I live and I&#8217;ve got a GS3 w/a grandfathered unlimited Verizon LTE plan, but damn I want this phone!!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good play internationally. But in the US. With LTE already covering 250 million people by Verizon&#8217;s towers, AT&amp;T in 77 markets and growing every month, Sprint and T-Mobile both rolling out LTE&#8230; clearly LTE is the future. So it just doesn&#8217;t make sense for a new phone to launch here in the US without LTE.</p>
<p>Worst part about it, LTE data plans cost exactly the same as their non-LTE counterparts! You&#8217;re paying for it whether you&#8217;re using it or not!</p>
<p>Tim cook has just sht his panties.</p>
<p>I was going to say take my money, but Verizon is the only carrier in my area. I really wanted this phone, but if it&#8217;s not on Verizon then I guess Windows Phone 8 is my next best bet. You will be missing out on a lot of my business from here on out Google.</p>
<p>note II!</p>
<p>Hey guys, so I am sold on the new Nexus 4. I am currently on Sprint and they really didn&#8217;t care if I tethered my phone bypassing the 20$ tethering fee by installing Cyanogen Mod on my original Evo 4G. So what I want to do is purchase the new Nexus 4 directly from Google and get the prepaid unlimited everything $70/monthly plan shown here <a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/monthly-4g-plans" target="_blank">http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/monthly-4g-plans</a></p>
<p>I am hoping that the phone will come with Vanilla Android directly from Google. Do you think that T Mobile will notice/care if I use my phone to tether a few times a week? They charge an extra $15 a month for tethering but I am hoping to bypass this fee.</p>
<p>I have no idea about stock-Android tethering on T-Mobile, but I&#8217;m surprised that&#8217;s the plan you want to get.</p>
<p>I think if I were you, I&#8217;d go for the $30, 100-minute plan, but I don&#8217;t know how much you talk on your phone. Also, if you&#8217;re willing to deal with a contract, T-Mobile has &#8220;Value Plans&#8221; which would give you actually-unlimited data for the same price, or 500 minutes and unlimited data for $60.</p>
<p>Just in case you haven&#8217;t considered it. ;)</p>
<p>Is that really how much you have to pay in the US? Wow &#8211; it seems like an awful lot to me (in the UK).</p>
<p>I think they can detect you if you tether your device depending on what browser you use on your computer.  You would have to change the user agent of the browser to be that of a mobile browser.  This is what I got reading from the posts on XDA.</p>
<p>I can understand Googles desire to not deal with carriers (speaking of the US), but why wouldn&#8217;t they want to make this phone available to as many people as possible?  I&#8217;m assuming most consumers spend some time online searching phones that their current service providers carry.  Or they walk directly into the stores to do their shopping.  If this phone is not being carried by 3 of our networks, how does that benefit Google?  Why put out a product with with limited availability?  I&#8217;m also assuming that most of the people that purchase this phone are already familiar with the Nexus line.  I doubt there will be many first time Nexus users.</p>
<p>This phone can be used on 2 out of the 4 major carriers.</p>
<p>I get that, but how many people on At&amp;t will know that this phone is even an option?</p>
<p>Too many people are complaining about the lack of storage or the lack of LTE. Do you people not understand Google didn&#8217;t make the phone to suit EVERY BODIES needs. The phone is great, it&#8217;s unlocked, only $350 for 16gb with NO CARRIER SUBSIDY, quad core s4 pro,  2gb ram, inductive charging, and more. If you don&#8217;t like all those things and the only thing you care about is 32GB/64GB of storage and LTE then as people keep saying, this isn&#8217;t the phone for you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s literally NOT MADE FOR YOU, it&#8217;s made for people like me and others who always have a connection around them and take advantage of the awesome cloud services Google offers. There are compromises with every product including the iPhone 5 and the S3, everyone has their preference and that&#8217;s all there is to it.</p>
<p>These comments are hilarious. No LTE&#8230;saves battery! Max 16gb&#8230;who needs more! Glass back&#8230;so nice!</p>
<p>Oh the hypocrisy of Android fanboys&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly surprised Google is releasing this as a &#8220;flagship&#8221; device when it is a two years behind the rest of the market, including other android devices.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t many people who are saying this. I recognize that these are negatives, however I am willing to make a trade-off for no contract and low price. Additionally I have about 4 months until my contract is up so a 32 GB one should be out by then.</p>
<p>Its an Optimus G with no LTE or micro Sim&#8230; Google needs to focus on whatever they need to do to bring and keep he latest version on Android on all their phones. If they need to lock the platform down note do it. What is Version going to say they aren&#8217;t going to sell Android phones any more if they do&#8230; I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>No they don&#8217;t. If you haven&#8217;t noticed, they command something like 70% of world wide smartphone market share. Do you think they would have been able to do that if &#8220;fragmentation&#8221; was something people cared about?</p>
<p>Alternate headline: Google releases iPhone 4 copy two years late</p>
<p>OMG!!!! DO WANT!</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t know the iPhone 4 had a Snapdragon S4 Pro, 4.7&quot; Display,  and was conveniently priced.</p>
<p>but it did have android 4.2!  wait&#8230;</p>
<p>The price is so killer. I love that Google is fighting the carrier model that has crushed US wireless for so long.</p>
<p>I hate yet another LTE comment, but isn&#8217;t T-mobile supposed to roll out LTE next year. Will the N4 not work on it?</p>
<p>N4 has no LTE radio at all.  it will work on Tmobile HSPA+ but not LTE.</p>
<p>Im floored.</p>
<p>This all looks way better than what I expected (based on the  Optimus G) &#8211; maybe LG has improved after all. I definitely did not expect such a low price at launch :)</p>
<p>LTE would have been nice, but at least here in Germany LTE coverage is still rather rare, I guess it will take another year until it becomes a deciding factor for these purchase decisions.</p>
<p>The only downside is the lack of LTE?<br />
Well, no LTE here. So seems it&#8217;s the perfect device.</p>
<p>And this should get a score of at least 8.8.<br />
The Optimus G got a 8.3 and this should score higher on design, camera, software and battery life.</p>
<p>low storage is another downside.</p>
<p>made by LG is another downside&#8230; but that might be mitigated by the fact that it&#8217;s vanilla android</p>
<p>I suppose a refresh, after about 6 months, will bring LTE and 32GB storage.</p>
<p>But now, I guess Google&#8217;s main focus is to get the best quality for the lowest price.<br />
There are a lot of other Android phones to choose from, and you will most probably find one that suits your needs, if you&#8217;re a poweruser.</p>
<p>Imo, Google is aiming at the mass market (and maybe business users) with this phone.<br />
How many casual smartphone users use more than 16GB?<br />
(I currently have 8Gb and managing that just fine)<br />
People will just see a big screen, quad-core, nice design and a very low price.<br />
(And at that price, you can&#8217;t really complain about any missing features.<br />
You can even consider it as a sample. It can be one hell of a way to introduce people to android.)</p>
<p>So for the casual user, NOTHING can beat this phone.</p>
<p>sorry, this is not my next</p>
<p>For all of you guys complaining about the lack of an SD slot, and saying &#8220;i&#8217;ll get a GS3/Gs4 instead&#8221;, here&#8217;s an idea:</p>
<p>Have you heard of these?<br />
<img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71y0WNHsQTL._AA1500_.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;s right. Forget 16/32/64GB. What about 500GB? you could buy the Nexus 4, one of these, and still save $200 over the GS3 while having as much local storage you could ever need plus some.</p>
<p>Of course, these will last for about 5-6 hours before battery dies, but if you need the space for Hi-def video, your phone&#8217;s battery will be dead in about that time too.</p>
<p>Oh, and it&#8217;s the size of a pack of cigarrettes, in case you&#8217;re wondering.</p>
<p>My point? SD cards are not the only local storage solution. And the Trade-off (having to support the shitty USB Mass Storage protocol) is not really worth it, IMO. There are alternatives to SD cards.</p>
<p>now THAT&#8217;s some good hyperbole.  way to go.  I still say this phone is not a good deal.</p>
<p>Wow that&#8217;s the most practical idea I&#8217;ve ever heard!</p>
<p>Not</p>
<p>Will used Galaxy Nexuses drop below the $200 or $150 mark?? I&#8217;m hesitating between getting this or a used last-gen flagship for even less (if that happens anyway)</p>
<p>Not for a while. The 2-year old Nexus S today still demands $180-$200. With tax + shipping, you&#8217;d still be looking at ~$380 to bring the Nexus 4 home. Used Galaxy Nexus has been hovering around the $280-300 mark for a while now. It might drop down to ~$200 early 2013.</p>
<p>Really? I haven&#8217;t checked in a while, but I bought a Nexus S this past january for 120.</p>
<p>The CDMA Nexus phones are that cheap and the GSM devices tend to be almost double. I bought a new in the box Sprint Galaxy Nexus last month for $150!</p>
<p>which is funny since the NEW off contract prices are substantially higher for the cdma phones as compared to the play store.</p>
<p>Bought my Nexus S 4G used from eBay for $68 out the door a couple of months ago.  When my wife&#8217;s Evo 4G crapped out on her, I gave her that phone until a better phone comes out.  The Nexus S 4G (despite being slower on the updates due to it being CDMA) is still a pretty good phone, and even better at $68!</p>
<p>No thanks. I prefer the iPhone.</p>
<p>Thank you for your wonderfully insightful comment.</p>
<p>Nexus 4 + T-Mobile $30/month for unlimited data plan = more money saved towards my vacation in Europe!!!!<br />
&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
And, and, I will be able to buy a cheap prepaid SIM card when I&#8217;m in Europe and use it with this phone! Awesome!</p>
<p>I will have to stick to Apple unless Google wants to sell their stuff to where I live. They can&#8217;t be serious!</p>
<p>The price is a huge surprise, a pleasant one.  I thought I was going to have to drop 500 to get this phone, glad it&#8217;s just $350</p>
<p>Crazy great price for one of the best phones out there. The best if you only look at androids. I&#8217;m definitely getting this&#8230; Google have a winner in their hands.</p>
<p>That price&#8230;.you can almost hear the knife at the carriers throats. The time of falsely high priced phones subb on contract may be in serious jeopardy.</p>
<p>The price is absolutely astonishing. In my opionion there was no option ever for a &gt;16 GB device because other OEMs would have suffered tremendously. LTE is still fledging but local storage is what people really look for. The Nexus 4 with 32GB at 399 would have killed too many competing Android handsets. The Video <del>terrific piece btw!</del> talked a lot about partners here, partners there. You don´t hurt Partners (that bad),</p>
<p>makes sense.</p>
<p>besides ive dealt with only 16 on my gnex for a while so im ok with it, i store all my most listened to music on the phone locally (8gb) and then the rest of my library has been uploaded to google music (40gb) so i still have access to those obscure songs when i need them.</p>
<p>I guess that makes sense. But the partners deserve some hurt for their sucky and inconsistent OS update support. And that&#8217;s one of the biggest selling points of the Nexus devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disco City on the back&#8217;<br />
Love it</p>
<p>What about&#8230;White Housing??</p>
<p>Is the &#8220;chrome edging&#8221; chromed plastic or actual metal??</p>
<p>Price = amazing.</p>
<p>Selling this in the US where people are used to buying phones from their carriers and carriers will have no interest in selling a phone that doesn&#8217;t lock them to their plan = super hard.</p>
<p>Will be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>
<p>For that price I am leaning more towards the Note II.</p>
<p>Damn, Google. Under $400, unlocked, gorgeous, and great specs, this is definitely my next.  Lack of LTE is a bummer, but manageable.</p>
<p>dat price! But dont know if i like the back. On some photos it looks good on some it looks ugly as hell.</p>
<p>Flagship? err&#8230;the flag is flying at half mast. There is an 8GB model? Google is showing it&#8217;s hand&#8230;Nexus 7 all over again.</p>
<p>Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but for me I just want an HSPA+ device since I live in Costa Rica and there&#8217;s no LTE here yet. I like that Google remembered the outside markets and not only the US, but people in the US shouldn&#8217;t worry since eventually there&#8217;s going to be a version with LTE.</p>
<p>In the  article he says that people were expecting this to go toe to toe with the Iphone 5, and it does apple has different version of the iphone 5, internationally there&#8217;s a  HSPA+  only version.</p>
<p>and I love the verge I&#8217;ve been here since the begging but I never commented or anything,  my first site in the mornings :)</p>
<p>Ok, so..</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be buying the 16gb and ditching my G Nexus, although, if and when my LG nexus breaks, where does it go for repairs when I&#8217;ve purchased it from google? (i&#8217;m in Aus)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s $399 AUD for the 16GB version and $349 AUD for the 8GB plus $20 for shipping from the Google Play Australia store. Looks like it&#8217;s too good a deal to pass up on.</p>
<p>$399 for 16GB is too much for me &#8230; hoping the price drops a bit or they shift the storage options from minimum 16 rather than 8 for same price.</p>
<p>Oh, I see now. So all of the sudden no sd card, all glass doesn&#8217;t matter anymore?</p>
<p>Still no music for Canada? What in the hell is the hold up!? I can&#8217;t justify buying another Android device until that option is available.</p>
<p>My next phone looks nice.. :D</p>
<p>Comparing the people you see working on Android and the people you see working on iOS, it&#8217;s apparent who is younger. As that one dude said in the video, &#8220;That&#8217;s how we roll&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple needs younger faces and a fresher perspective on things. Doesn&#8217;t help that they recently fired a pretty talented guy for responding to an email late or something of that sort.</p>
<p>&#8230; No LTE on the new phone? Very disappointing. I&#8217;ll hang onto my Galaxy Nexus and wait for the Nexus 4 LTE. Everything else Google has announced is truly sensational.</p>
<p>When i get this, i&#8217;m gonna get the T mobile monthly 4g plan. its only 30$ a month and its unlimited data with the first 5GB at 4G!! Seriously, this is ultra cheap</p>
<p>Preach it, brother!</p>
<p>I am in the market for for an unlocked phone, and I was going to go WP8 all the way then this came along&#8230;</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t even considering Android, but at such a low price point I just don&#8217;t know if I can pass it up&#8230;</p>
<p>Where can I get a Google Play shirt like the one in the video?</p>
<p>I think you guys should fix the &#8220;compare&#8221; section.. The prices are misleading.<br />
In the pricing it shows: iPhone 5 starting 199$ and Nexus 4 starting 299$, with no mention of one being with contract and the other being unlocked..<br />
I say you should add the unlocked price for the iPhone for clarity</p>
<p>Hold up. The Galaxy Nexus&#8217; display,  which your own review rates as a 9 out of 10, is considered so-so?</p>
<p>Does that mean that, in today&#8217;s market, with updated standards, the Galaxy Nexus has an average or just slightly above average (i.e. a 6 or 7 out of 10) display? Because that&#8217;s what &#8220;so-so&#8221; says to me, and I wasn&#8217;t aware that it&#8217;s already been left behind so much that this new screen is a &#8220;massive upgrade.&#8221; I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s going to be getting at least a 10/10, right?</p>
<p>It was a year ago. However, I do find it surprising that it was rated 9/10.</p>
<p>Where does Matias shop for his shirts?</p>
<p>16gb max storage and no LTE?   doesn&#8217;t even need a trololol.   And fandroids call iOS hamstrung and stagnant.</p>
<p>The renders of the Nexus 10 look crap but the device in the flesh is beautiful!</p>
<p>so it looks like when the phone lies on it&#8217;s back, the speaker is unhearable. I mean Samsung always tries to have something on the back that elevates it a little, like the camera on the  GS3 or the spaker grill itself in the GS1.<br />
Or does the nexus 4 have a little chin? I&#8217;m not shure looking at the second picture in the gallery</p>
<p>Google produces 14 minute commercial and embeds it in a Verge article.</p>
<p>I like what I saw.</p>
<p>I also like that there is no CDMA/LTE, those guys should get what they pay for. <br />
I know people cry about speeds,, take a secod and ask why your laptop performs so much faster on  slower residential internet? That&#8217;s right, the bottleneck is elsewhere, SoC, to be more specific.</p>
<p>Great prices, might get both. The empty complaints tell me these are great devices, the more crying, the better the actual devices.</p>
<p>I JUST GOT THE IPHONE 5. I AM REGRETTING THIS SO HARD AARRGGHH.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re regretting buying a phone with LTE because another phone without LTE was released?</p>
<p>No LTE? :( And I don&#8217;t like the glass back&#8230; Sigh..<br />
The price is great though</p>
<p>Wow people moaning about storage ? 16GB plus drive plus dropbox the phone is sick for £379 never mind £279&#8230;. why the fuck are isheep on here ?  Go listen to lies from apple !  Or fuck off home using your superior maps app ha ha mind that melted bridge ..</p>
<p>the price is incredible</p>
<p>Will they continue to sell the galaxy nexus?</p>
<p>New nexus! Whoooooo!!<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/tVHN1.gif" /></p>
<p>What is that video from, must see the whole thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv9aCYy7Dr0" target="new"></a> A music video called PALANCE!</p>
<p>This device was a no brainer until I read that there is no sd card slot. I hate my iPhone because it&#8217;s always full. I have to delete old podcast to download new ones. This was a total misstep. If the contract versions have an sd slot I will be very disappointed. I want out of my contract and a no contract phone at this price is very appealing. It&#8217;s not really that big of a surprise that there are some compromises for a very nice no contract phone for that&#8217;s not $550.00 or more.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely beautiful price point for this device. Yes okay it has 8gb&#8217;s for $300, but that gets so literally the best specs on a phone to date. With stock 4.2 AND IT&#8217;LL GET EVERY NEW UPDATE. <strong>gasp</strong> Seriously considering selling my AT&amp;T HTC One X (which after storage partitions has only ~10gbs) and picking one of these up.</p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s not Apple vs Google. They both make great stuff. But I think Google makes a better phone and Apple makes a better tablet. I can&#8217;t see myself buying one brand of both.</p>
<p>^ This.</p>
<p>Ermahgerd!</p>
<p>that LG brand is the only reason im not getting the Nexus</p>
<p>This is totally off subject.  Here is how lazy I am.  I looked at this story, and I said, &#8220;Damn, I wish I could have this text read to me.&#8221;  So I highlighted some text, right clicked, chose Speech, then Start Speaking.  My wish come true!!! I&#8217;m sure this feature has been around for awhile.</p>
<p>With the price at $300 for the Nexus 4, the price for the Galaxy Nexus and previous Nexus devices on the secondary market brings them down considerably.  Great price point for a new smartphone.</p>
<p>Ok the price is amazing. I need the 8GB version, the question is this one.</p>
<p>Can I buy that phone online via their site and put a T-mobile chip on it? I don&#8217;t care about space or lack of LTE on T-mobile that won&#8217;t matter. Please answer =)</p>
<p>Yup. That&#8217;s what unlocked means. This phone will work straight out of the box with AT&amp;T and TMobile SIMs.</p>
<p>Who else on sprint is pissed?</p>
<p>Not me, this was kind of expected since CDMA is such a pain in the ass to deal with. (can I say ass?)</p>
<p>this phone is like a mullet</p>
<p>A possible noob question here.  But I don&#8217;t see the benefit of the unlocked phone price in the US since only T-Mobile will let you use it and you can get discounted plans.  I tried doing this with Verizon a few months back and wanted to get a Galaxy Nexus unlocked.  I asked if they offered a unsubsidized discount since I bought my own phone and they told me they don&#8217;t.  So the phone is $299.99 which is about $100 more then most flagship phone but then I still pay the monthly subsidized free with AT&amp;T, Verizon or Sprint.  I mean for Europe this is an amazing offer.  Am I missing something here?  Go easy on me.</p>
<p>You can take it to T-mobile, straight talk, simple mobile, ATT, etc and use this phone. Straight talk uses either T-mobile or ATTs network for 45 bucks a month unlimited everything.</p>
<p>ATT offers discounted plans with a purchased phone?</p>
<p>Actually AT&amp;T&#8217;s prepaid plans are horrible. Go with T-Mob or Straight Talk (AT&amp;T MVNO).</p>
<p>No, you aren&#8217;t missing a thing.</p>
<p>Look into GSM MVNOs (Mobile virtual network operators). Most offer prepaid service for less than $50/month, which is usually around $20-30/month cheaper than postpaid plans. So if you bought an unsubsidized phone to use with prepaid service, you&#8217;d recoup the initial investment in about a year, then save money the second year. However, since the Nexus 4 is going to be offered at such a low price to begin with, the sticker shock of buying an unsubsidized phone is much less.</p>
<p>Postpaid service seems like a better deal, since you get a cheaper phone up front, but carriers lock you into the two year contract so that you have no choice but to pay the higher monthly rates.</p>
<p>I know what Google was trying to do but geeeeze i was really hoping this would come to Verizon in some way, then Verizon would finally have  a great Nexus.  The Gnex was only ok and when a truly great Nexus comes along i don&#8217;t get the choice to have it. (I can only get decent signal in my area with Verizon) I am truly saddened by this Google, Please say a Verizon version will come out later&#8230;</p>
<p>I love how this doesn&#8217;t have LTE but everyone is all like &#8220;woooo!&#8221; &#8220;or i&#8217;m getting this&#8221; but if Apple decided not to put LTE in their iPhone 5 then there would be some major hate in these comments and everyone would have went the F off.</p>
<p>You noticed that there is a price difference of 330€ ?</p>
<p>LTE Kills the battery on my i5 to the point where I can&#8217;t even use it.</p>
<p>Will not miss it on the Nexus 4!</p>
<p>Matias Duarte just gives me the heeby jeebies. The guy has grown a lot since the Palm days and the passion in his voice makes me want to buy Nexus everything.</p>
<p>No LTE makes it dead on arrival.  LTE on my Note is invaluable.</p>
<p>What do you use LTE for primarily?</p>
<p>He needs to fully load his favorite cat video on youtube instantly &#8211; so he can skip to his favorite part 5:47 in.  Can&#8217;t watch that video if it doesn&#8217;t fully load in 5 seconds ya know.</p>
<p>PS&#8230; /s</p>
<p>By not including LTE or going all in with the carriers Google is trying to make a statement.  They don&#8217;t want to be bullied by the likes of Verizon into mutilating (bloatware etc..) their devices just so they are on every carrier with LTE etc&#8230;  I hope people buy this phone and it becomes a success so the carriers realise how much revenue they&#8217;ve missed out on.  In Europe (UK in my case) we can practically take any unlocked phone and use it on any network.  There are certain carrier which use different bands that all phones don&#8217;t support but majority of the people are covered.</p>
<p>Lets hope Verizon et al. learn from this and offer more freedom.</p>
<p>No 32GB&#8230; i want this badly, I want to jump to Android (from iOS) but that&#8217;s not enough! Surely 32GB is coming&#8230; right&#8230;?!</p>
<p>32 GB would be nice.  I have a GNex currently and 16 GB has sufficed for me.  With music and apps &#8211; as much as I&#8217;d like to have my 50 GBs of music on my phone, I realize that&#8217;s unrealistic, and Google Play Music covers any gaps I would need.  Though I don&#8217;t have any movies are large videos on my phone&#8230; But then again&#8230; It&#8217;s a phone.  If I wanted to watch movies on a mobile device (certainly not one with a small screen), I&#8217;d use a tablet.  Or even cheaper, a portable DVD player.</p>
<p>8GB is a pretty crippling amount of storage, especially after the OS install. Don&#8217;t believe otherwise. The idiots spouting cloud storage have more than a few screws loose. And man are they vicious.</p>
<p>Yeah, for sure if you buy this phone you need to pony up the extra $50 to double the storage. Fortunately, it&#8217;s not an extra $100 like Apple would charge.</p>
<p>Thankfully the next step up is only $50.  Still amazing price.</p>
<p>Will Nexus 4 be sold in any phsyical stores in the US? Help me out guys! Thanks.</p>
<p>Whenever Android dev&#8217;s makes an email and calendar client that is better+integrated than either Windows Phone or iPhone, I will be the first to buy it.</p>
<p>Wow I was going to buy the new Ipod touch, but for only $50 more an clearly much better specs I&#8217;m going for this.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it look a lot thicker than the Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>It is 0.2 mm thicker, though Galaxy Nexus is a lot thicker at the bottom.</p>
<p>why would they make it thicker? is the battery larger? Maybe the glass added the thickness.</p>
<p>Wait. I don&#8217;t live in the US. Sooo, no LTE? Doesn&#8217;t matter for at least 2 years&#8230;..!</p>
<p>I bought my Galaxy Nexus brand new from Amazon for £520.00 in January and this is coming in at £279.00?!!! INSANE!!!</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t like how messy Goggles UI is. Very many too little icons here and there..Seems like there is no much logic and fluidity. Every screen can have different UI.</p>
<p>Goggle?</p>
<p>The words you&#8217;re looking for are &#8220;flexibility&#8221; and &#8220;choice&#8221;.</p>
<p>FTFY :)</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll have to take back what I said about the back in another post. This is a thoroughly attractive phone.</p>
<p>I like the wording &#8220;thoroughly attractive&#8221;. I agree.</p>
<p>This will make me sell Samsung Galaxy Note.</p>
<p>Bye bye Samsung TouchWiz.</p>
<p>The backing pattern looked so familiar but I couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it&#8230; and then it hitme!</p>
<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5TFzyvLK9NA/T9as7abMwxI/AAAAAAAADN0/IpRMr3hJqRA/s1600/BladeRunner-21.jpg" /></p>
<p>Awesome!</p>
<p>It&#8217; so funny how every Apple fanboy here cries &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t have LTE, but, but, if the iPhone was released without LTE, every Fandroid out there where be talkin&#8217; mad $#it about it!&#8221; Well consider this&#8230; the $300 price difference is damn good justification for not having LTE. There!</p>
<p>Yeah, while I&#8217;d obviously rather have a faster network connection, I&#8217;m not willing to pay 2x as much per month for it.</p>
<p>I was disappointed with lack of 4G and that the thing maxed out at 16GB but its death knell for me was choosing LG to build this thing. It&#8217;s like partnering up Great Wall to build your Google driverless cars.</p>
<p>I bought a Galaxy Nexus about 2 days ago for about the cost of the 8GB Nexus 4 model. I just wasn&#8217;t expecting these prices! The question is, should I sell? The advantage of the GNex is the removable battery I guess, how much of a deal is that? sure it has 16gb but I&#8217;d be fine with 8gb tbh.</p>
<p>Try to return/sell it! I was on the fence, trying to decide whether to buy a Galaxy Nexus, mostly enticed due to the incredible price. However, it seems the Nexus 4 has a much faster processor, better screen, and better camera, for basically the same price. The Nexus 4 also has a monster battery, so I imagine battery life shouldn&#8217;t be a concern for &#8220;normal&#8221; use.</p>
<p>Now watch these guys rate the iphone 5 better than Nexus 4..  Which they clearly did with the ipad mini over the nexus 7  Only B/C apple released a 7 inch tablet makes it wonderful in these jokers eyes!! I really don&#8217;t take there reviews at face value anyways!! especially when it comes to any Android devices.. I signed up just to post my comment, I don&#8217;t search them out! Sent from My Galaxy Nexus Running Jellybean 4.1.2</p>
<p>Considering all the LTR networks are limited to 10Mb/sec right now I dont know what the fuss is that this thing is HSPA+ only.  All of Europe has had a 15Mb blanket of HSPA+ for over 4 years now.  Just cause we have LTE, doesn&#8217;t mean we compete, and we pay probably double in phone bills what Europeans do for faster speeds/more data.  Most of them live of Mobile internet as well!</p>
<p>Also the fact that these 2 devices are class leading in specs and price is a HUGE deal.  I have been wondering for a while why an Ipad is so much cheaper than an iphone.  The extra licensing and testing that needs to be done for the additional radios cant cost 200+ more dollars.  This Tablet being 100 bucks less than the ipad for its resolution and the phone being 1/2 the price of all other unsubsidized phones is nuts.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T should pick up this phone and sell it free on contract if they are smart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering all the [LTE] networks are limited to 10Mb/sec right now &quot;</p>
<p>What uh&#8230; who told you that?</p>
<p>I pay £35 a month for 2000 mins, unlimited texts and unlimited data.  Us Europeans get it so good&#8230; frankly I don&#8217;t care about LTE at this stage.</p>
<p>EE in the UK want to charge that for their LTE service &#8211; but with a monthly 500MB cap.</p>
<p>So you can use up your whole months allotment of data in about 10 minutes.  Brilliant.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of life in the non-LTE networks yet!</p>
<p>If Google wanted to jab Apple they should of made a Female MicroUSB connector that accept a male MicroUSB in either direction.</p>
<p>damn, that&#8217;s disappointing</p>
<p><strong>Woof!</strong></p>
<p>This is my next.  Google and Android, thank you for continuing to push boundaries and producing excellent software that continues to evolve, unlike a certain competitor.</p>
<p>I will be ordering a 16GB as soon as they are available.  I bought the 16GB GNex and thought 16GB would be limiting but Google Music solved that for me.  I have a log of music my squeezebox server but I edited that down to about 15GB in Google Music.  I created a playlist for the 250 or so songs I listen to frequently that is cached locally on my phone and voila&#8230;I have only 1.5GB of music on my phone now.  I could add more to Google Music but haven&#8217;t felt the urge to do so.  I don&#8217;t commute on trains, etc. so I could understand how this type of setup wouldn&#8217;t work for those that do.  Right now I have 9 GB available so going from a 16GB to an 8GB model would be to tight for me&#8230;but I could see how 8GB would work for others who don&#8217;t have a lot of media and games.</p>
<p>If you have good T-Mobile coverage in your area, I think it would be very difficult to beat the bang-for-buck of buying a Nexus 4 and getting a T-Mobile value plan.</p>
<p>Let me make sure I&#8217;m getting this right.</p>
<p>As an AT&amp;T customer, I can buy this phone without a contract for $299, plug my SIM card into it, and be good to go?</p>
<p>Correct. </p>
<p>I can totally get behind Google&#8217;s push for unlocked devices. With inexpensive plans from T-Mobile and other GSM MVNO&#8217;s, having the best hardware without paying an arm &amp; leg for service.</p>
<p>How long will this one be the Google flagship phone?  3 weeks or 4.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus is from november 2011. So that&#8217;s almost exactly a year when the Nexus 4 becomes available.</p>
<p>Not sure what your point is.</p>
<p>seriously, some one needs to tell Google to put this phone on Verizon. They have the biggest and best coverage in the US, and I want the nexus. I have been holding off on upgrading since April because I wanted the new Nexus and can&#8217;t believe HTC/Verizon still hasnt updated my DInc2 to ICS! Come on google!</p>
<p>More like tell Verizon.  Google already tried to work with Verizon with the GNex and it was horrible.  Verizon wants it&#8217;s hands in Google&#8217;s cookie jar.</p>
<p>I would order one of these over android any day.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/AmhOq" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/AmhOq</a></p>
<p>Sorry to say&#8230;</p>
<p>People keep comparing Nexus4 to iPhone, but what about the Galaxy S3? Anyone buying a Galaxy S3 or HTC X also seriously overpaying. I think that&#8217;s the bigger story &#8212; Nexus4 is a flagship Android phone for half the price of all other Android OEMs and just as good if not better! If I were Samsung or HTC, I would potentially be seriously scared / upset&#8230;does this set the trend that says Google will release equivalent hardware with stock Android for half the price / at cost compared to those OEMs in the Android open handset alliance who make their margins on units sold?</p>
<p>Definitely awesome price though..and we are certainly getting one!</p>
<p>The Galaxy S3 or HTC One X are probably $450 off contract if you shop around. They do offer some extras over the Nexus 4 which people might be willing to pay extra for.</p>
<p>Of course the next generation of Android phones with this new generation of quad core S4 power will have trouble asking $600 for their phones at the time of introduction.</p>
<p>Let alone the Lumia 920 (with it&#8217;s dual core SOC) wich was supposed to start at €650.</p>
<p>I agree completely. Sort of apples to oranges to me. Even so-called unbiased reviewers can&#8217;t resist the temptation to compare it to the venerated and beloved almighty iPhone.</p>
<p>Is it unlocked for all carriers in the world ?</p>
<p>Figures, I just bought the Nexus last month.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re telling me this phone will only cost about £200 off contract? Honestly? I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s possible, with these specs it&#8217;ll undercut the opposition massively and sell millions surely?!? I just hope it&#8217;s not pentile!</p>
<p>The screen was compared to that of the oneX and its awesome screen.</p>
<p>I paid €550 for my Samsung Galaxy S3 in Central Europe three months ago and I&#8217;m gonna switch as soon as I can to the Nexus 4, even though I&#8217;ll be probably making a loss of €150 by selling it.</p>
<p>My reasons are that I&#8217;m fed up with the update policy (5mo waiting for ICS, over 4mo for JB) and I think the SGS3 could have some more RAM (the European version only has 1GB).</p>
<p>The LTE coverage in my country is about 70% (outdoor) but I&#8217;d have to pay €45/mo on a 2-year contract plus €30 activation fee  <strong>on top</strong> of my contract. (10GB, 50mbit)</p>
<p>Since I am glad that I am not on a contract, I won&#8217;t sing up now. In my country you can have everything else unlimited for €35/mo.</p>
<p>Bye bye, SGS3! Welcome Nexus 4!</p>
<p>Generic attempt to win an argument on the internet.</p>
<p>16GB only with 4cores ? No memory card slot ? Made of glass ? For 300$ ? Seriously ? Im sorry but it seems to be very much of useless &#8230;</p>
<p>300$ seems like a lots to you. lol</p>
<p>Even a 100$ is too much. I never pay for, if I&#8217;m getting it on the contract I&#8217;m getting it for free as anything else. The only thing I bought was an IPhone 4S 32GB (in the day when SJ died) and only as a memory (!). And the rest of them Galaxy s3 / Sony XperiaS I&#8217;ve got for free on the contract.  And you ???</p>
<p>You actually do pay for your device in the monthly payments</p>
<p>Really !!! Thank you so much for bringing that shine of light in my days !!! If you&#8217;d like to fart more please don&#8217;t hesitate just bring it on ;) ;) ;)</p>
<p>Well you did&#8217;t seem to understand this simple fact so I thought i&#8217;d enlighten you.</p>
<p>So if you do understand then how do you explain your post? &#8220;100$ is too much&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;i never pay for&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;I’m getting it for free&#8221;.</p>
<p>You probably paid $700 for that iphone, $650 for that S3 (in hidden subscription costs). So how is $300 &#8220;too much&#8221; then?</p>
<p>Sucks to be you.</p>
<p>this will be my first smartphone&#8230;</p>
<p>I was waiting for a long time for the nice phone in this price range. I&#8217;m not on the contract so this is fantastic news for me. I&#8217;m ready to ditch my Windows Phone I purchased on the fire-sale for $80 and switch to this amazing phone. Not willing to wait any more for Microsoft to push harder. My only concern is lack of SD slot but I don&#8217;t see that as deal breaker. I will purchase this on day 1.</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 seems like a great addition to the new Nexus device lineup. Just a point regarding the Nexus 4&#8217;s screen size though. It isn&#8217;t actually 4.7&quot; because the botton 0.4&quot; is taken up by the on screen buttons. Since the buttons are very much required, people will prefer not to hide them even with a mod. Soooo &#8230;.. it looks like we are stuck with a 4.3&quot; screen instead of a 4.7&quot; one. If anyone is interested in seeing what a 4.7&quot; screen looks like with capacitive buttons, please compare the Nexus 4 with an LG Optimus G (side by side photos).</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Hm. I&#8217;ve been wanting to pick up an Android phone for development purposes/general research. Looks like I&#8217;ve found that phone. I really can&#8217;t argue with that price tag! And, while LG&#8217;s Android offerings until now have been sort of flaccid, the LG phones (and other stuff) I&#8217;ve had in the past have been rock solid (unlike Samsung).</p>
<p>Plesase explain why the Nexus 7 gets 32GB; but the new Nexus 4 is limited to only 16GB?  The standard is now 32GB and top of the line is 64GB &#8211; with some having micro SD cards to even extend that out more!  Does Google phone engineers and sales personnel live in a bubble?  I thought that you always want to at least offer the same as your competitors do?  Apple iPhone options are: 16, 32, 64 GBs of storage.</p>
<p>Why is everyone saying the price is so great? It&#8217;s no cheaper than any other high end smart phone WITH LTE. You can get an iPhone 5 with LTE for $299 on contract. It&#8217;s almost like Google threw up their arms and said, welp, there&#8217;s no way we can compete with the iPhone 5 so we might as well not even try. Disappointing.</p>
<p>In most parts of the world, e.g. here in Western Europe with 400 million people, carriers offer two subscriptions: a contract with a phone, and a sim only contract without a phone. <br />
For the same number of minutes/texts/MB&#8217;s the sim only contract can be €600 to €800 cheaper over the span of a two-year contract.<br />
So for the money I&#8217;d be paying to get a 16GB iPhone 5 with LTE on a two-year contract, I could buy an unlocked 16GB Nexus 4 in two weeks, and a 32GB version with LTE in a year.<br />
That seems much more future proof. ;)</p>
<p>Anyone know how the battery can be replaced in a few months/years?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sealed battery so hoping there&#8217;s an official easy process to replace it.</p>
<p>Whoa&#8230; it says he wasn&#8217;t just assaulted AT a McDonald&#8217;s, but by the actual McDonald&#8217;s employees! Yikes&#8230; Also, why is he naked in his picture?</p>
<p>Yeah, the original Google promo video for project glass featured crazy-haired naked people with bad teeth. Good thing they changed it&#8230;.it&#8217;d be a shame if everyone thought project glass made you look ridiculous.</p>
<p>He probably was speaking Canadian French and they reacted badly.</p>
<p>And what does the letter from his Doctor say?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I certify that Dr Steve Mann is not crazy. We&#8217;ve tested him extensively. He&#8217;s just weird.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After reading more about this on Reddit where I first saw it, the whole story looks fishy.  The McDonald&#8217;s he is referring to is a flagship store in Paris where they do not allow photography of any kind.  Dr. Mann curiously keeps repeating that the pictures and video that was recorded was due to the EyeTap being damaged during the assault and that teh employee basically filmed himself, which sounds very odd.<br />
If you read a bit more about Dr. Mann and his blog, he is also known to be an activist for peoples rights to record video on citizen &#8216;journalism&#8217;.<br />
I&#8217;m also not quite sure what the purpose of the EyeTap is, i.e. Dr Mann keeps mentioning it as &#8220;allowing people to see better&#8221;, but does he actually have a disability that is being corrected with a prosthetic or is this just augmented vision?  If the device is purely for recording, McDonald&#8217;s is private property and they can legally demand that you not use the device on their property.<br />
Does any of that make battery justified?  No.  I&#8217;m just saying that there may be more factors at play.</p>
<blockquote>After reading more about this on Reddit where I first saw it</blockquote>
<p>Stopped reading right there.</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like saying you did research on wikipedia, it&#8217;s nice, but not reliable</p>
<p>Compared to some of the nearly content-free reposts on The Verge?</p>
<p>Except that Reddit does not write/author/produce content&#8230;. it&#8217;s merely a link site, so all &#8220;research&#8221; comes from the source article.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reading something on reddit&#8221; is more like &#8220;I found a link to this article on reddit&#8221;.</p>
<p>Submitting links to blogs and Wikipedia articles? Not so reliable.<br />
Submitting links to CNN, Forbes, HuffPo, Reuters? Very much reliable.</p>
<p>Non-redditors seem to have a hard time with this.</p>
<blockquote>where they do not allow photography of any kind.</blockquote>
<p>What? Dumb rule.</p>
<p>As I recall from my visit, a lot of people I met in France were a bunch of assholes. I&#8217;m not surprised.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been around, not extensively, but around&#8230; and the one place I refuse to ever go back to, even if you gave me a ticket for free, is Paris.  What grimy s***ty city.</p>
<p>I worked briefly in Stuttgart, Germany on a project with folks from several European countries (I am from the US).  While on the project, I got to spend a vacation day in Strasbourg, France and the people there were very friendly.</p>
<p>The only rudeness I encountered was from a Belgian co-worker who was constantly insulting Americans and Australians.  He had some kind of inferiority complex and insulting others made him feel superior.  He made it a point to speak French at meetings after insulting Americans because most Americans only speak English.  I don&#8217;t think this guy was indicative of most Belgians, but there is an anti-American (and perhaps anti-Australian) sentiment in some European countries.</p>
<p>What is odd, is that those who hold that sentiment are accusing others of being rude, when in fact it is they who are being rude.  Ironically, I have never met an Australian I did not like &#8212; very down-to-earth people in my experience.</p>
<p>Funniest incident was when the rude Belgian guy was speaking French once at a group dinner, I was able to understand part of what was being said because I had studied Spanish and both languages derive from Latin (I have also picked up some Italian from my parents).  When I responded to the French the look on his face was a panicked stupor as he suddenly believed that I perhaps understood everything he had been saying in French for the entire evening (which I am sure included some choice insults).  I let him believe I understood everything that had been said by simply saying &#8220;well, French sounds a lot like Spanish and Italian so I can make out most of it&#8221;.  Truth is, I could only pick out bits and pieces when concentrating and I tuned out most of the non-English conversation since I considered it rather rude to converse with a group of people in a language that only part of the group understood even when the whole group had a common language.  The German folks on the project never once spoke German in front of me without immediately translating it for me &#8212; in fact one German woman on the project tried to translate the French when she had the chance, but I&#8217;m sure she politely avoided the parts I would not want to hear anyway.</p>
<p>The folks in Stuttgart were very nice with the exception of one street vendor who had a good laugh at my attempt to order food in broken German via a book I had picked up.  He pretended he understood none of what I said.  It took me a while to figure out he did understand me, but was messing with me &#8212; I must have repeated myself 20 times with varying pronunciations of my order in German.  If only we had smartphones and online translation back then and I could have typed in my order, translated it, and shown him the screen.</p>
<p>I went a few years back and because I was British and didn&#8217;t speak the language well (I at least tried when I could) they looked at me like I wasn&#8217;t human and treated me as such, especially when trying to buy things</p>
<p>I go there about once a year for a week or two at a time, and I have always found everyone quite friendly and helpful. It&#8217;s the British tourists who are the noisy pricks &#8212; everywhere I&#8217;ve been. I have become convinced that the stereotypical &#8220;ugly American&#8221; is actually due to mis-identified Brits.</p>
<blockquote>The eyeglass is permanently attached and does not come off my skull without special tools. </blockquote>
<p>Wow, admire his commitment to the field.</p>
<p>I admire the McDonald&#8217;s assailant. If we don&#8217;t stop them now, the cyborgs will take over!</p>
<p>Yes it requires special tools to remove these from his head, they are called hands.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing the &#8220;special tool&#8221; is actually the person to whom the device is affixed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like the employees had something to hide, like they were concerned about cameras being there&#8230; hmm. I have a feeling this might go deeper than it appears&#8230;</p>
<p>::shifts eyes:: I think you&#8217;re onto something</p>
<p>I want to say they were buying/selling, but even small time runners could make enough to not push a broom mcdonalds. It&#8217;s likely they were on the work release program and the glasses could have caught them in parole violating acts.</p>
<p>If not, they have been fed McPropaganda on a level unparalleled by even the late and merciful Mao<br />
<img src="http://img.thisismoney.co.uk/i/pix/2011/05/chineseDM_469x319.jpg" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s genius!  Who is the artist?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s, er&#8230; one of the many collaborations between China and someone with photoshop?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an actual chinese propaganda poster with Ronald McD&#8217;s visage pasted over the head of the man holding chairman Mao&#8217;s little red book.</p>
<p>Maybe they just wanted you to THINK he was justa broom pusher at McDonalds&#8230; if it was a McDonalds at all&#8230;</p>
<p>But seriously, organized crime is a big problem in Europe as of late.</p>
<p>a bigger problem is unorganized crime. Stupid thieves and assaulter unafraid of the police, everywhere and everytime. It&#8217;s getting worse and worse in Paris. Many people can&#8217;t bear it anymore.</p>
<p>Sounds like the people of Paris need to organize some street justice.</p>
<p>they need some vigilantes with augmented vision to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Steve Mann is the hero gotham deserves, not the one its needs</p>
<p>Yes, off with their heads! Where is Dr. Guillotine when you need him?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve gotta go deeper!</p>
<p>Ok, a couple of weird things.<br />
He got assaulted in a macdonalds by the staff and cant get their names? Is not interested in pressing charges for being assaulted and having a &#8220;vision aid&#8221; being ripped off his skull? Has pictures of the assailants but has them blurred out?</p>
<p>Takes a &#8220;promo shot&#8221; of his invention but forgets to wear a shirt.</p>
<p>ahum.</p>
<p>Wonder if his wife is an argumented projection or is actually real?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s a typo, it&#8217;s a great one!</p>
<p>He obviously removed their faces when posting publicly due to privacy issues (he&#8217;s not interested in exposing the assailants to the general public), which is actually very responsible. He&#8217;s seems interested in pressing charges, if you read the source. He&#8217;s tried to get ahold of McDonald&#8217;s, the Consulate, the Embassy, and local law enforcement, but no one is helping (hence making a public blog about it). McDonald&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t even returned his requests for assistance.</p>
<p>Also, he got the name of one of the assailants, even though the assailant tried to hide his name tag.</p>
<p>Not saying there isn&#8217;t a possibility of it being faked, but I&#8217;d say at this point I probably believe him. Might look more into his back story to make sure there isn&#8217;t anything made up there, since that would obviously be a tip off to him lying, but for now I believe him.</p>
<p>I totally buy this story. You guys have got to come to Paris and see who eats at McDonald&#8217;s. Bad luck (or good luck, given the name tag), though, that one of the assaulters was working for McD.</p>
<p>If somebody tried to rip something off my head that was attached in apparently a semi permanent way I don&#8217;t think &#8216;respecting their privacy&#8217; would rank real high.  Sure, blank out the faces of everybody else, but the guys who attacked you? No way, you&#8217;d post their faces.</p>
<p>This looks incredibly suspect, solely based on the facts in this story.</p>
<p>I mean suspect int hat someone in that McDonalds knows the people in the photo. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to get them identified and charged.</p>
<p>This was suspect! because it was a botched job done by Google (Skynet) agents, for the advancing of Google&#8217;s project glass. In the year 2020 Google will take over the world through Google&#8217;s project glass, by creating the ultimate Reality Distortion Filed.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with your vision. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are now controlling the transmission. We control the horizontal and the vertical.

For the rest of life we will control all that you see and hear. You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the deepest inner mind to the outer limits.</p>
<p>Google 2020</p>
<p>of course it would be easy to identify them &#8211; IF THEY GAVE A SHIT!, which they don&#8217;t.<br />
same goes for the cops. it would be easy to go there and find out who they were.. if the cops gave a shit.</p>
<p>technically they were over zealous about the no-photographing rule. for some mysterious reason(wtf, it&#8217;s just a mcd,). maybe the employees like to boast that they don&#8217;t actually work there..</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t think McD&#8217;s would want to out their own employees until a lawsuit is pushed. They&#8217;re basically claiming responsibility if they do and will owe him a lot of money to settle. Probably, they are doing their own internal investigation in preparation for a lawsuit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/wo1d9/steve_mann_father_of_wearable_computing/c5f0cwe">This redditor</a> apparently works with him and says that his story doesn&#8217;t match up with what his glasses actually do. There&#8217;s more to this story than meets the (ahem) eye.</p>
<p>And so the wars between the augmented and the non-augmented have started&#8230;</p>
<p>Wait, Mann. Co does not sell this yet?</p>
<p>They do, as well as McDonald-styled hats now too!</p>
<p>I read this last night and found it quite sickening.</p>
<p>The McDonald&#8217;s restaurant on the Champs Elysées avenue is maybe the most exposed restaurant to all kinds of threats : terrorism, burglars, pickpockets, wanderers who are asking money, etc, etc&#8230;<br />
The staff there is under high tension all day long and maybe if Mann wasn&#8217;t clear about his intentions, it could have led to this kind of &#8220;precautions&#8221;. <br />
It&#8217;s sad that we cannot enjoy a McDonald&#8217;s meal in every store in the world, but it doesn&#8217;t surprise me.</p>
<p>Did you bother to read the story? He showed his documents to the employees and they not only ignored them, they ripped them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security&#8221; guys in Paris can be really really dumb.<br />
Especially in high tension environnments like this.<br />
It&#8217;s the only reason I got.<br />
(Je suis parisien)</p>
<p>Ooo! His &#8220;papers,&#8221; how important. Spend five minutes in that area and every gypsy dipshit on the planet will have jammed &#8220;important documents&#8221; in your face.</p>
<p>Well, according to some french websites, it seems some customers have spotted mice in some parisian McDonald&#8217;s, and they have published pictures on social networks…</p>
<p>Now, there was no problem at all in Museums and other &#8220;dangerous&#8221; places. <br />
Besides, some security guard checked his &#8220;disclaimer&#8221; at first and it was OK. Then some &#8220;normal&#8221; employees came and assaulted him. <br />
Moreover, it is not the first time employees of this McDonald&#8217;s are assaulting someone. Another visually impaired customer was assaulted because she was taking pictures of the menu in order to zoom in and read it…</p>
<p>Now, McDonald&#8217;s France facebook page is overflowing with links of this story and their community manager is doing his utmost to… erase those comments.</p>
<p>Needless to say the French Police did nothing when the case was reported — I&#8217;m living in France and can say people can say a lot of negative stuff about the French Police, particularly in some cities where we could call them &#8220;a wild bunch of cowboys&#8221;.</p>
<p>LOL at the French police. Utterly useless, especially in Paris, if there hasn&#8217;t been a murder.</p>
<p>He should have been wearing Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses instead.</p>
<p>What about the people who don&#8217;t want their every move digitally recorded? Cos that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re going with glasses cams.</p>
<p>What about personal liberty to live without being watched and analyzed like a lab rat?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not an animal. I&#8217;m free. I don&#8217;t want any more of my privacy removed. Why not put us all in a battery farm with a camera on each one of us and a feeding muzzle?</p>
<p>Damn straight that all pervasive cameras need permits. It&#8217;d be all too easy for a digital dictatorship the likes of which has never been seen to rise up and enslave us all.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong but what if I&#8217;m not?</p>
<p>We need limits on camera technology. Human rights are under threat.</p>
<p>What we need is technology that can disable cameras. Oh and all front facing mobile device cameras need inbuilt user controlled physical lids.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Damn straight that all pervasive cameras need permits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Too late, they are already ubiquitous &#8211; they are called phones.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really the same</p>
<p>Also, cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not an animal&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes you are and so am I.</p>
<p>If you are in the public realm, you are in a zone where you can (and are) have pictures taken of you. If on private property, you can make rules against it. But, you are in the public eye in public &#8211; and can have pictures/video taken of you. You should expect privacy only on private property or while using private equipment (your house and your phone, for example).</p>
<p>And, granted, McD&#8217;s is not in the public realm &#8211; but if they didn&#8217;t make a rule against it, I don&#8217;t see why someone shouldn&#8217;t have the freedom to take pictures or video in the restaurant. I am not aware of a rule against it.</p>
<p>But they do have a rule against it.  McDonald&#8217;s doe not allow video or photography in that flagship store, which is not owned or operated by a franchise.  They should have just asked him to leave and called the police if he refused.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you should be able to walk around filming minors without permission.</p>
<p>Sue their asses for all they&#8217;ve got.</p>
<p>France&lt;&gt;the USA.<br />
He&#8217;d lose.</p>
<p>Did you just call french people lawless yahoos?</p>
<p>They have their (we have our) priorities&#8230;</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Europe&lt;&gt;the USA<br />
I think he&#8217;d win.</p>
<p>he can sue McDonalds and have his project funded for the rest of his life. This is a publicity nightmare for them.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s great for Google either if this escalates. I know it&#8217;s nothing to do with them, but it&#8217;ll spark a debate outside of the tech press about civil liberties and how tech is infiltrating our lives. Framing that debate around this story isn&#8217;t particularly helpful for those that want to see this sort of tech gain mainstream acceptance.</p>
<p>I think, with every phone being a camera now anyway, the social acceptance for this will come rather easily.</p>
<p>Such a weird story. Why is there no explanation at all to why the &#8220;McDonalds employees&#8221; did this? They must have said something about their reasons for ripping the device off his head and pushing him out the door?</p>
<p>Also, why on earth is he recording everything he sees? He claims that it normally overwrites the recording, but why record video continuously to begin with?</p>
<p>This. So little info on what they had against these glasses.</p>
<p>It is recording everything it sees as a buffer for him to be able to see, as it is a vision-aid. It overwrites it constantly, as he only really needs to see things that are happening currently.</p>
<p>Sounds silly, but what do I know about strange vision afflictions&#8230;</p>
<p>But it at least recorded from the time he was ordering his burgers to the time it got ripped of his head. That&#8217;s several minutes if not a quarter hour of video recorded on the device.</p>
<p>How is that &#8220;currently&#8221;?</p>
<p>My understanding is that they don&#8217;t allow cameras in that particular mcdonalds, probably in fear of documentation of some cleanliness or pest problem that would get the store closed down.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one place to go if you&#8217;ve been assaulted: not the consulate, not the ambassy, not the McDonald&#8217;s management, but: the police.</p>
<p>If you read the article he did go to the police and they were not interested.</p>
<p>How come an intelligent man goes to eat at McDonald&#8217;s?!?! FTW</p>
<p>Especially if they broke your one-of-its kind very expensive equipment.</p>
<p>And you have their mugshot.</p>
<p>And that in Paris, of all places!</p>
<p>Clearly, he has no taste, but that&#8217;s not a good enough reason to beat him up&#8230;</p>
<p>He claims he was assaulted, he has pictures of the people who assaulted him. Just go to the Police and file an aggression and property damage claim.</p>
<p>He talks about another woman who was prevented (maybe roughly) from taking pictures in the same restaurant but the Police couldn&#8217;t help. While the Police couldn&#8217;t help if someone prevented you from taking pictures (with no traces of physical violence), breaking your stuff is something they could handle (especially expensive stuff). And the restaurant certainly have security camera footage the Police could request.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t need to go after McDonald big corp: just those 3 guys here are enough.</p>
<p>(disclaimer: I&#8217;m French, living and working in Paris).</p>
<p>Well, if you&#8217;re French, you should know the Police doesn&#8217;t even remotely care about that kind of incident. Sadly&#8230;</p>
<p>All they&#8217;ll do is taunt him one more time.<br />
<img src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT4r8ooJARDRautW-ey9hTdOGQDqrLnr2unrpmldRcbDSuOm5USff91RthR" /></p>
<p>He went all the way to Paris, and took his family to McDonalds!?! You, Sir, do not have my sympathy.</p>
<p>Yeah, you should see the punishment for ordering a hamburger in Italy, it&#8217;s brutal.</p>
<p>Wow, could he have marketed it worse? It screams &#8220;paedophile&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the worst story I&#8217;ve ever read. And here are reasons why:</p>
<p>1. No reason why he was assaulted.<br />
2. Why is this thing permanently attached to his head?<br />
3. Why is he in France?<br />
4. Why is he naked in the picture above?<br />
5. What does this have to do with Google?<br />
6. Why is the picture of him so awful with yellow teeth. Meanwhile the Asian gent next to him is airbrushed and seems to be whispering sweet nothings into my ear!<br />
7. This guy is American? Why is he giving papers to McDonalds workers in France trying to explain what an augmented reality device does? I would have punched him too.</p>
<p>1. That&#8217;s the question isn&#8217;t it, we don&#8217;t know why<br />
2. I wonder that myself, WHY is he wearing it. No story I have read explains this<br />
3. Does it matter? <br />
4. Does it matter?<br />
5. Nothing, it&#8217;s obviously a comparion shot of the two wearable computers<br />
6. Whoa, you mean, you can like take two pictures, taken at two different times, and put them side by side? Trippy.<br />
7. Probably because those were the only papers he had?</p>
<p>The article is pretty awful, but not as awful as some of your inane questions. He had papers because he had been traveling around Paris all day. Going to museums and other tourist spots where there is heavy security. Surprise surprise the only people to have an issue with his wearable computer were the McDees employees. He hadn&#8217;t had to show his papers at all that day.</p>
<p>Again, the story is very incomplete but you&#8217;re questions are idiotic.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t comprehend basic English?</p>
<p>1. Yes, I know! That&#8217;s why I added it as a point and it makes this story awful.<br />
2. Well I&#8217;m glad we feel the same way, jerk!<br />
3. Matters to me. If you don&#8217;t like it then log out of your machine (probably a Mac).<br />
4. Matters to me. If you don&#8217;t like it then log out of your machine (probably a Mac).<br />
5. Why is it being compared. OH! Because comparing it with Google Glass makes me understand this story so much more.<br />
6. Thanks for teaching me how image manipulation works. I would love to give you a certification so you can present it at future interviews.<br />
7. Yes, exactly. Then if he had papers, in most likely another language, why is he trying to explain such a complex subject to Frenchman in McDonalds. It&#8217;s absurd and makes no sense.</p>
<p>Everyone is entitled to their comment. But really your comment is a waste of time. I am not mad at you. I am mad at myself for wasting my time.</p>
<p>You should be mad at yourself, if I asked such stupid questions I would probably be mad at myself also.</p>
<p>Not to mention a quick google search would have provided a much better story that would have answered a few of your questions.</p>
<p>Also what the hell does my computer preference have to do with anything? Your idiotic assumptions about both myself and the story say more about you than you seem to think.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mad because I&#8217;m wasting my time replying to someone with the mental capacity of a termite.</p>
<p>I was commenting on the story here Sherlock! Stop bringing Google into this.</p>
<p>If you dislike my assumptions, that is fine. But your reply here confirmed many of them. Now please log out and stop wasting bits.</p>
<p>One more reply, just for fun.</p>
<p>How did my replies confirm your assumption that I use a Mac (an incorrect assumption by the way, not that it matters).</p>
<p>Actually you got trolled. Thanks for the laughs. I was not bored, loser :D</p>
<p>Ah, the ole troll defense. The defense of imbeciles everywhere who have no clue. Carry on you dolt.</p>
<p>Haha, you mad.</p>
<p>Why would I be mad, it is obvious from your original questions that you weren&#8217;t trolling anything. I never claimed to be bored, you are the only one who said they were wasting their time. You need to know what a troll is before you can claim to be one.</p>
<p>Haha you still don&#8217;t get it. Go on then.</p>
<p>dammit, it happened again.</p>
<p>stop it you mac users</p>
<p>I believe it is a vision aid</p>
<p>7. Indeed &#8211; guys working for McDonald either don&#8217;t know how to read or have become too angry to try understanding things due to the harsh industrial aspect of their job.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re shortsighted, read his damn blog. Fuck.<br />
<a href="http://eyetap.blogspot.ca/" target="_blank">http://eyetap.blogspot.ca/</a><br />
In case you couldn&#8217;t follow to the source.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link, usually I check the bottom of the article but I hadn&#8217;t had my coffee yet. Apparently arguing with idiots is easier than reading, WHO KNEW!</p>
<p>Ah, yea, had already seen this. Good read though.</p>
<p>Still stand by my point that a simple Google search would have answered most if not all of his questions.</p>
<p>He never asked for this.</p>
<p>Ahahahahaha.</p>
<p>While this story is super light on facts (seriously Verge, it&#8217;s pretty sad) I&#8217;ve read a few stories on the issue and still can&#8217;t figure out WHY he is wearing the glass. Does it help his vision? Is it just cool? I don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>Apparently it doesn&#8217;t come off.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a researcher. This is part of his research.</p>
<p>His augmentation array also augments his vision, monitors biomedical data, and provides a number of other very useful functions.</p>
<p>Very awesome. The way he kept talking about a physicians note lead me to believe that he had sight issues to begin with. It&#8217;s irrelevant really as he was discriminated against plain and simple.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s a toy.  Got it.</p>
<p>Um, by that logic most things we interact with on a daily basis would be a toy. That computer or mobile device you just typed that out on&#8230;toy.</p>
<p>And&#8230;???</p>
<p>It takes a special kind of punk to be assaulted by Parisian &#8220;thugs&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Paris has become an unsafe city for every kind of citizen. Wearing AR glasses doesn&#8217;t help but that is no excuse.</p>
<p>This man is trying to get a free Google Glass headset by inventing this story&#8230;</p>
<p>Guy has no reason to invent this kind of story.</p>
<p>Seeing as how he&#8217;s basically the reason Project Glass exists and his daily and attached augmentations cost half a million, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s likely.</p>
<p>So it automatically recorded the incident? Interesting. This brings up a really good point: What effects augmented reality projects like Google Glass could have on crime/violence/assault rates. If people can quickly, easily and discreetly record incidents like this happening could this be used to drive crime rates down?</p>

<p>I think the only thing it would change is that BEFORE you get assaulted/raped/mugged, they destroy your glasses or kick you in the eye really hard. <br />
Just to make sure.</p>
<p>Only idiots have the glasses transmitting to a storage device on their person. Pretty sure someone beating the crap out of you would be a decent indication that something was up. Not to mention the tens of other people watching you with their glasses.</p>

<p>I want his tie.</p>
<p>What am I looking at?</p>
<p>Ouch!  There are times when Hi-Res images are not an advantage.  He should go around greeting everyone by saying &#8220;We are Borg!&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this for real?</p>
<p>my whole face is itching after seeing that.</p>
<p>Maybe he was complaining about  his <em>Royal with chesse</em> one too many times and they sent in the McGoons to rough him up a bit.</p>
<p>So are we saying that Goole ripped off the Project Glass idea too?</p>

<p>Dude, you can only hunt so many national treasures before the stress gets to you.</p>
<p>If you guys and gals are interested in a possible future where everybody has one of these gizmos on their head recording all of the time you should check out Earth by David Brin. It&#8217;s a fantastic book.</p>
<p>Nevermind, someone beat me to it. Though the title of the novel was buried in a link.</p>
<p>The Assailants: &#8220;Our bad&#8230; we thought you said you wanted the &#8216;French Spies&#8217; with a shake.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the glasses re truly needed for a medical condition that&#8217;s fine, but if not no sympathy public or not we need more Corleones busting heads at these people recording and taking pictures of everybody and everything in places/property they dont own&#8230;&#8230; a business that owns property fine (the younging have paintball guns for that), a citizen who does not, nope fair game. There will be a big market for jamming &amp; blocking equipment that blocks all this crap. If you have a &#8220;right&#8221; to take a picture or video of me on &#8220;public&#8221; property you don&#8217;t own i have the &#8220;right&#8221; to knock the glasses of your head doing the recording or snatching the camera and throwing it against some concrete for being a disrespectful human being mind your business.</p>
<p>Ugh, I think your opinion is pretty repulsive though I can&#8217;t really tell. You don&#8217;t actually have a right to punch someone in the face who is taking a picture in a public place, not to mention the device only stored the pictures after it was broken. You would and should be charged with assault if you attempt to do that to someone in a public place. Not to mention the person in question had documents explaining the device. Please, try to take my camera away from me while I am taking pictures in a public place, then I will have the right to defend myself.</p>
<p>Dont do the crime if you cant pay the fine/do the time nowhere did i mention punching the person just breaking the equipment they are being disrespectful with, you want to film me get a release and pay me otherwise mind your business not every wants to be on camera for whatever reasons some even religious we do have freedom of religion dont we. Im not an animal in a zoo. Yes you can defend yourself may the better man win, im not saying im bruce lee or chuck norris but if more people started defending themselves from people invading their privacy maybe less companies would be trying to promote it wanna take pictures of buildings animals landscapes whatever want to take a picture of me ASK PERMISSION or mind your business</p>
<p>The only crime here was discrimination and assault. Also it is going to be hard to break the equipment since it is attached to his face. I have my doubts that you even bothered reading the article before you jabbed out your poorly written response. I do not need your, nor anybody elses permission to take a picture in a public place. For someone claiming to be so enraged you really don&#8217;t know the relevant laws regarding taking pictures in public places. I&#8217;m done here, you and your arguments are barely coherent and you obviously have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>I said if its medically needed fine I have no issue with that he just trying to see better with new tech&#8230;&#8230; you want to take a pic/vid of me you may not &quot;legally&quot;need permission but i will make sure you smell my cologne (since that may be over your head that means i will get close enough for you to smell my cologne) lol im not enraged at all, you may be attacking my intelligence but anyone who tries to decphifer tone from text is unintelligent in my book i find the whole thing comical MIND YOUR BUSINESS the fact that you dont think taking pics or recording strangers extremely rude and disrespectful is the problem these days. VITO ANDOLINI</p>
<p>So, say a tourist is shooting  some video and you happen to be in the field of view &#8212; are you going to grab and break his camera?</p>
<p>We should flash mob that place with everyone wearing one of these and see what happens:<br />

<p>I don&#8217;t get it whats with the papers.<br />
are you not allowed to film in a McDonald is that why he had to show them his papers.<br />
and is that why they got into a fight</p>
<p>there is such little info in he article it was so hard just to read it .</p>
<p>More than anything else, it is redicuoulsly creepy that this is attached to his skull.</p>
<p>How is said device attached?</p>
<p>Was he awake when he attachments for the device were being installed?</p>
<p>This story is spider man-esque, next think, he will be shooting lasers from that eye.</p>
<p>Frankly, the bigger crime here is that he took his family to McDonalds while on vacation&#8230;</p>
<p>I jest, of course. There seems to be a lot we don&#8217;t know here. Quite an odd story&#8230;</p>
<p>If there was ever a time for this pic&#8230;<img src="http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk42/roberthartca/canadianborg.jpg" /></p>
<p>Or just add your Gmail as an Exchange account with m.google.com as your server.</p>
<p>1 easy step instead of 4 long ones.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the way I have mine setup as well, but it&#8217;s been heavily rumored that Google may pull exchange support so this is really helpful.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t heard that. If they do that, well, f***.</p>
<p>If they do that, then I&#8217;ll just stop using Gmail. They&#8217;d be shooting themselves in the foot.</p>
<p>And what will you be moving to?</p>
<p>From the sounds of it, Outlook.com.</p>
<p>Looks like the did it :(</p>

<p>And they just did.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s unfortunate&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh excellent, finally motivation to delete my Gmail account.</p>
<p>That said Google often says they&#8217;re pulling out of something and never do. See H.264 and Chrome for example.</p>
<p>Just political positioning.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a comment on a tech site saying it&#8217;s heavily rumored that metalfx is deleting Gmail accounts. ;)</p>
<p>You are correct good sir. I feel ashamed to have been dragging my feet.<br />
Account deleted.</p>
<p>You want a cookie?</p>
<p>NOOOO.. Google has too many on me already :P</p>
<p>The only thing between me and (at long last) deleting my Google account is YouTube.</p>
<p>I wish I could delete my Gmail account.. But the change.. the change, I am afraid of all the drama that would included with such a major change..    All my contacts.. all my folders.. everything is so organized in my gmail account..</p>
<p>Not sure if you are a Mac user, but iCloud can import them.</p>
<p>Good point!<br />
Just for reference:<br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/27/3418366/google-carddav-contact-sync-ios" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/27/3418366/google-carddav-contact-sync-ios</a></p>
<p>"It’s been rumored that Google is considering phasing out support for ActiveSync, and it now has a viable alternative in CardDAV."</p>
<p>Too bad CardDAV is stuffed, and constantly syncs back faulty data. It&#8217;ll be fine for days at a time, then Google will just decide that it doesn&#8217;t like the custom fields, or high-res profile photos should be shitty little postage stamps.</p>
<p>Yes, they were supposed to have fixed that &#8211; the contact photos. In practice, they haven&#8217;t. It&#8217;s broken.</p>
<p>Try this: Add a high-res photo on an iPhone via CardDav. Go in to Google Contacts online, and edit the contact (play with a field or whatever). Go back to the iPhone, and Google will sync back down a crap version of the contact. It&#8217;s just broken, because the online contacts are broken and don&#8217;t understand the profile photos. It also seems to randomly rotate photos online.</p>
<p>Basically, Google CardDav = screwed thanks to Google Contacts on the web.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not you its me&#8230;.</p>
<p>Try it using iCloud.  It&#8217;s the iphone at fault, and has been this way even before contacts were sync&#8217;d.  If you add a photo on the iphone it stays big, if you do it via sync it&#8217;s small.  Seems like it&#8217;s never been addressed since the first firmwares.</p>
<p>I have mine as exchange and it works great, but if Google pulls exchange that would suck..</p>
<p>Why in the world would Google do that? There is just no reason for them to do that at all. Google has always allowed every possible avenue of access to all of it&#8217;s services. Just makes no sense as to why they would do such a thing. That&#8217;s just a rumor I think and not at all a likely reality.</p>
<p>Why? My guess is that they want to go from now on with an open, well defined standard for calendar (CalDAV), address book (CardDAV), and email access (IMAP).</p>
<p>What ground are you standing on w/ that statement sir?</p>
<p>Woa! Now this is totally true!</p>
<p>exception for google apps for business</p>
<p>This DESTROYS you battery if you get a lot of email. Dislike.</p>
<p>You can turn off the push notification per account, no?</p>
<p>You lose Push if you don&#8217;t use Exchange. What about that?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t! You&#8217;ll get email notifications through the Gmail app, and CardDAV and CalDAV push just fine.</p>
<p>The DAVs do not push.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right — I have the DAVs set at 15m fetch, which is fine for contact and calendar sync.</p>
<p>although the  iOS settings say &#8220;Fetch&#8221; for my newly added (non-Exchange) GMail account &#8211; I still receive them as if they were pushed&#8230;</p>
<p>Or you could give Android a shot with great Google mail and calendar sync out of the box.</p>
<p>Maybe you didn&#8217;t read the thread, but the iPhone syncs gmail just fine. The question is about the optimal method to maximize battery. Something that Android also struggles with.</p>
<p>It is against The Verge&#8217;s employment policy to use technology made by non-Apple companies.</p>
<p>Agreed. Contacts and calendars have less of a need to push. Less battery used.</p>
<p>Exchange uses a single connection to push all data. Having Gmail push e-mail PLUS 15 minute polling for contacts and calendar will use MORE battery.</p>
<p>Not really&#8230; I think something&#8217;s funky with Google&#8217;s ActiveSync implantation because I don&#8217;t hear similar complaints of battery drain on actual Exchange accounts with push on.</p>
<p>Just the fact that one would even have to think about settings for fetch and/or push is a sign of a fail to me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing you&#8217;re not the standard of the world and we have options to change things if something is negatively affecting our experiences?</p>
<p>lads &#8211; what is going on? ye have me confused now. seriously.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try this out.</p>
<p>My battery life on the iPhone 5 is about 8-9.5 hours usage. If this takes me over 10, you sir get a beer on me.</p>
<p>I have 4 Exchange accounts set up (two actual Exchange, two Gmail/GApps) and don&#8217;t have an issue with battery life. I probably do a few hundred messages a day across the accounts without issue.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m using Exchange on my iPhone 5 as well.  Nothing close to that number of emails, but my battery life is insane nonetheless.</p>
<p>You need an edit button.</p>
<p>This is how I tell &#8220;normal&#8221; people to configure their iOS devices, but enterprise environments insist on applying policy on your device so there won&#8217;t be a way around using ActiveSync for those users.</p>
<p>Then turn off push. It&#8217;s push that uses your battery up, not Exchange.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using exchange for GMail for years and have never had any problems with battery life.  &#8220;Push&#8221; is much friendlier on battery life than &#8220;Fetch&#8221;/polling.  It was Exchange that gave you &#8220;Push&#8221;.</p>
<p>I noticed that when I use Exchange I cannot add more than 1 reminder per appointment.</p>
<p>Install more memory.</p>
<p>Please explain</p>
<p>We actually already covered some of that in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3382098/how-to-sync-multiple-google-calendars-to-ios-android-windows-phone">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>Except you loose access to all the Gmail features (labels, archive&#8230;)</p>
<p>Exchange doesn&#8217;t support as many fields as cardDAV does. For example, phonetic name and custom labels of the fields.</p>
<p>If you use this, exchange is totally broken.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the <em>best</em> way to use Gmail and Google Calendar on your iPhone :)</p>
<p>Thanks for the post Evan. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this. It&#8217;s great to know how Verge staffers set up Gmail and Calendar.</p>
<p>I just want to say, I tried this method, and it doesn&#8217;t work out well for me because the Gmail app <strong>doesn&#8217;t give you push notifications for forwarded emails. </strong><br />
(I forward all my mails from all accounts to my main Gmail account, so it&#8217;s easier to keep track.)</p>
<p>Okay, nevermind. <br />
It was because my filter skipped inbox on the forwarded emails.</p>
<p>Using this method now, let&#8217;s see how much battery I save.</p>
<p>Can you turn off push notification for an exchange account? That&#8217;s the main issue. With the setup suggested above, I would want my notifications to come on the gmail app, and <strong>not</strong> the mail app.</p>
<p>You can. And they would.</p>
<p>Recommend the first comment please. The article is plainly wrong. The best way to set up Google is using Google Sync, AKA Exchange, AKA &#8220;Push.&#8221; The article is a second best workaround.</p>
<p>Do it right. Use Google Sync. It makes all the difference.</p>
<p>No Thanks Google Maps was crippled on IOS and I want Gmail which has not performed well, or the Calendar. The phone works perfectly without them.</p>
<p>or just set your GMail up as an Exchange account&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to notice any loss in functionality in doing it this way.</p>
<p>Google Documentation here: <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=138740" target="_blank">http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=138740</a></p>
<p>This &#8220;offers tighter integration Google’s services than setting them up via Exchange ever could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three major cloud productivity services? Did someone forget about Drive?</p>
<p>They had no reason to mention Google Drive in the article because it doesn&#8217;t take any work to setup. Download the app, sign in, and you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>Agreed. Google Sync via Exchange as noted  benpike and Ad1tya. Been doing this for 2 years, works great, and syncs contacts in real time. If you want to use the iOS app for Gmail, just disable notifications for email (still useful to have set up when sending photos)</p>
<p>I get the first comment and it wsa deleted?</p>
<p>Be still my heart.</p>
<p>I read it before it was deleted and it was most likely due to the trolling tone it contained</p>
<p>i thought the obvious tone and me ending it with &#8220;gonna read the article now&#8221; was obvious i was joking.  le sigh.</p>
<p>I got it but joking aside it was probably going to start a flame war. The mods seem to be cracking down on those as of late.</p>
<p>well thats good.</p>
<p>That sounded like it was fairly amusing. Slightly disappoint.</p>
<p>lol all i wrote was &#8220;best way to get gmail and google calender on your phone?   Get an android.&#8221;</p>
<p>But i&#8217;d say the same thing if they made an article talking about getting your itunes songs on your android device lol.   Either way it was a joke..,.and this is a useful article.</p>
<p>did i miss where the advantages to this setup are over the exchange setup?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen some mentions of battery life advantages, but I don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>I would assume it depends how many emails you get no?   I think its keen to point out Verge does all their emailing through GMail&#8230;..most of us probably use gmail as our private email.</p>
<p>Believe it. My iPhone battery life almost doubled when I ditched Google sync with Exchange.</p>
<p>I would guess you also had push enabled?</p>
<p>Wow, that is great news if true! I have been using the Exchange method, and hadn&#8217;t considered this alternative. I&#8217;m sure many people would be interested in seeing a controlled test of battery life to prove this anecdotal point. Not sure how easy that test would be to set up, but it would get a lot of mileage around here as many people seem to be using the Exchange method.</p>
<p>Using Apple&#8217;s Mail.app for Gmail kinda sucks since you don&#8217;t get Gmail-y features like labels.</p>
<p>and star. Because star just HAS to be different than flagging. I blame gmail for that one. The mail app supports flagging, but the gmail star is something else apparently.</p>
<p>Support for gmail archiving, support for bigger contact pictures, support for custom labled contact fields, support for additional fields like phonetic name.</p>
<p>I have 3 exchange accounts on my iPhone, never had an issue with it. I think push notifications hog just as much battery and this is a lot simpler.</p>
<p>Sounds like iOS needs Defaults and intents&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/24/3384450/breaking-the-ecosystem-shackles-the-power-of-defaults-and-intents-in" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/24/3384450/breaking-the-ecosystem-shackles-the-power-of-defaults-and-intents-in</a></p>
<p>Yes. Badly. It&#8217;s almost unforgivable at this point.</p>
<p>Only almost?</p>
<p>It is unforgiveable. We should be able to set our default web browser, email client, and messaging client, but &#8220;oh no, that would be too complicated for most iOS users&#8221;, says Apple executives&#8230;</p>
<p>Not having pinch-to-zoom on Gmail wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal.  You had to pan around to see picture-heavy e-mails, but text was already fit to the screen.  It certainly is not as big as not being able to set your default apps IMO.</p>
<p>It was a huge deal in that it meant I never used the app. But that&#8217;s just one app.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;ve been kind of surprised that the neither the EU nor the US Government has weighed in on it.  Maybe they learned something with the Internet Explorer debacle, and maybe Google or Opera or whomever doesn&#8217;t feel like pushing the issue.  Given that we still hear stories about Microsoft&#8217;s penance in those trials and the fact that Apple so firmly locks down default functionality for some pretty critical items, it just seems a bit odd.</p>
<p>I feel egotistical recommending this, since it&#8217;s my post, but I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway :)</p>
<p>Android only JUST got pinch to zoom in Gmail. That was unforgivable as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine with this new gmail app. Email isn&#8217;t critical for me, so I only check manually using search: &#8220;is:unread&#8221;</p>
<p>Does this set up give you full size picture caller or small corner picture caller id?</p>
<p>I use Sync.Me for that. Syncs contacts with FB and you have an option of small photo or full screen photo. It&#8217;s nifty really.</p>
<p>Nope. I haven&#8217;t found a way around this either. It&#8217;s really annoying.</p>
<p>Interesting. Need to try it out. Never thought of exchange as a battery life hog. Like other commenters mentioned, it&#8217;s so easy to set it up and get everything synced</p>
<p>Does anyone find it annoying that the new Gmail app has to &#8220;startup&#8221;? It takes about 3 seconds to show me my inbox. I never had to wait when using the iOS Mail client. Am I crazy?</p>
<p>Sounds like your phone is slow.<br />
Mine opens up pretty quickly; certainly not 3 seconds after I tap.</p>
<p>Yep, drove me crazy because it was happening on my iPhone 5. I had to go back to Mail.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to add Mail and Calendar as two separate Gmail accounts instead of simply toggling both Calendar and Mail in one account? Also, you mention setting up CalDav, and there is specific CalDav support in the same place as the CardDav support, but you steer us towards the GMail option. Is that correct?</p>
<p>+1  anybody know?</p>
<p>Yeah, he just got it wrong.</p>
<p>Select Add Account&#8230; &gt; Other &gt; Add CalDAV Account, then add the same info as you did for CardDAV account. Also, be sure to go into Fetch New Data &gt; Advanced and be sure the CardDAV and CalDAV accounts are set to Fetch and Mail is set to Manual.</p>
<p>Wow, I definitely think faster than I type. Where is our Edit button! Argh!</p>
<p>I was initially wondering about this too, but the explanation is quite simple: this way you can set a different fetch schedule for mail and calendars. You&#8217;d want your calendar to be fetched regularly, but never automatically fetch mail because there&#8217;s the Gmail app for that. Setting it up like this will get you maximum battery life :).</p>
<p>This a reason why ios will always be a Fisher Price os for me. It&#8217;s 2012 apple. It&#8217;s pathetic that default apps and intents are that disgusting.</p>
<p>What does Fisher Price have to do with iOS&#8217;s default apps and intents system?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not &#8216;disgusting&#8217; if you use an email service that&#8217;s properly compliant with IMAP standards.</p>
<p>Oh look, another moron who has no idea what he&#8217;s talking about</p>
<p>Step 4 is wrong. There is already a GMail account setup in step 1b that conflicts with it. I think it is meant to be &#8220;Choose &#8216;Other&#8217; then CalDAV&#8221;</p>
<p>Gmail seems to recommend setting up CalDAV using the method above; however, it combines the Mail and Calendar accounts (and therefore, their Sync). Instead, I added a Calendar account separately by CalDAV using <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/you@gmail.com/user/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/you@gmail.com/user/</a> as the server.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve clarified the instructions, thanks for pointing out the flaw.</p>
<p>Performing these steps reminds my how bad iOS is. I love my iPad but I hate the OS. I would love it if Apple released BootCamp for iDevices and allowed us to install Cyanogenmod.</p>
<p>Yeahh&#8230;.no</p>
<p>Apple has no need to cater to gmail users.</p>
<p>This is the primary reason that I went back to the Android ecosystem because Mail on iOS/iPhone is so primitive compared what Google  offers, especially if you&#8217;re heavily Google services dependent like many of us.  To note, I went from a Treo &#8594; Nokia  E71x &#8594; iPhone 3G &#8594; 3GS &#8594; Inspire HD &#8594; iPhone 5 (for one month) &#8594; HTC One X+. I am not happy to have email work again.</p>
<p>*I am NOW happy.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not using gmail I actually find the email experience to be better on iOS than Android since the standard email app in Android is pretty subpar.</p>
<p>Guys, I&#8217;m pretty fuzzy on the whole CalDav thing. After I click Add Account am I really supposed to click Gmail or Other? If Gmail, why not just enable calendars from my already added Gmail email account? If other, then your instructions above are hosed.</p>
<p>You can sync calendars either by logging into the &#8220;Gmail&#8221; preset in <strong>Mail, Contacts, Calendars</strong>, or you can tap &#8220;Other&#8221; and individually set up a CalDAV account.</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess my question should have been, is there an advantage to one or the other?</p>
<p>An RDC to an Android Phone? ;)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really tied into Google services just get an Android phone. Less headache, best experience.</p>
<p>andriod schmandroid.</p>
<p>Or just use iCloud mail and do all your setup in one step (and yes, I know that Gmail has advantages over iCloud, but iCloud also has advantages over Gmail)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in trying this but I&#8217;m curious about why step 4 is to sync with a CalDev account but then just wants to use the Gmail preset.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have issues with using this CalDAV method? I have several subscribed calendars that I sync up to my phone. However,  when I do this the items keep duplicating themselves. And these items aren&#8217;t really attached to any calendar.</p>
<p>I have that same issue using CalDav <strong>and</strong> the normal &#8220;gmail&#8221; method for synching with the &#8220;read only&#8221; / subscribed Google Calendars.  Any ideas on how to resolve &#8211; it&#8217;s driving me crazy?!</p>
<p>Actually, the &#8216;gmail&#8217; method uses CalDAV so it is really the same thing. The Exchange method is the only other way.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t seem to have issues with subscribed calendars that come from other people. It is only the ones that are Google&#8217;s &#8216;interesting&#8217; calendars like Holidays and Sports.</p>
<p>As long as I use Exchange I don&#8217;t get the duplicates. I haven&#8217;t made it all the way through this thread on Google&#8217;s product forum, but it seems to be a related issue: <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/m/#" target="_blank">http://productforums.google.com/forum/m/#</a>!msg/calendar/AWJSWllOt9Y/l8IV4U7Ubz8J</p>
<p>I had no issues with mail and contacts, but the calendar method is wrong. <br />
They say &#8220;use caldav&#8221;, but the instructions say &#8220;select gmail&#8221;. I can&#8217;t do any of these. <br />
When I try to add another gmail account for calendar, iOS says &#8220;that account is already configured&#8221; (for mail)<br />
If I try to add it via &#8220;other&#8212;- caldav&#8221;, I have SSL issues and it won&#8217;t let me add it. WTF???</p>
<p>you&#8217;ve enabled SSL when adding via &#8220;Other&#8221; and &#8220;CalDAV,&#8221; correct?</p>
<p>Yes. But I get an error&#8230;. then it asks if I want to try it without SSL and it doesn&#8217;t work either&#8230; I don&#8217;t understand why you guys got it working and I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Nevermind. I don&#8217;t know why, but unlike CardDAV and gmail accounts, CalDAV only accepts your COMPLETE <a href="mailto:user@gmail.com" target="_blank">user@gmail.com</a> as username, instead of just the part before &#8220;@gmail.com&#8221;. If you do it this way it works.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve clarified the instructions, thanks for pointing out the flaw.</p>
<p>On Android: enter your Google password once when you buy your phone. There is no step two.</p>
<p>There is no step two here too. The author is doing all this to save some battery life</p>
<p>I will NEVER use Google to sync my contacts until they allow me to use images bigger than 64&#215;64. Get with the effing times google!!</p>
<p>Still love my gmail app though. Love the new Sparrow influence.</p>
<p>They actually fixed that 2 months ago.  You can now upload up to 720&#215;720 contact pictures into gmail.</p>
<p>Not entirely&#8230;.</p>

<p>One upped me from the same website&#8230;. well done.</p>
<p>Super helpful, thanks.</p>
<p>I use CalenGoo, as it supports a lot more of Google Calendar functionality, but I still find it lacking. One of many reasons I&#8217;m thinking about going back to Android.</p>
<p>I too was in desperate need to sync my Google Calendar to my iOS device and I found that setting it up in settings for just the calender has worked out great. It syncs all my calendars into the default iOS calendar with color coding. What functionality are you missing specifically?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Gmail user in an Apple world (iphone, ipad, mac). I followed this guide and I have a a ridiculous amount of accounts now &#8211; 1. Google account with caldav, carddav. 2. iCloud account (my apple id, which is registered with my gmail email address) is used for safari stuff, passbook, photo stream, documents, and find my iPhone. But I can&#8217;t use sync notes there since it&#8217;s not an @icloud account &#8211; so 3. I also need to sync my @icloud email (not my apple id account) account to for notes.</p>
<p>Is this the best solution? How would battery compare if I lived in an iCloud world (and only used gmail for email)?</p>
<p>Wait actually I only couldn&#8217;t sync notes because I was using exchange (m.google.com). Switched to a regular gmail account, and now I can sync notes without needing an icloud account.</p>
<p>Been using CalDAV method since the iPhone 3G.</p>
<p>I think an even better setup is using the new Gmail app alongside exchange for calendar/contacts. Unless your contacts and calendar are constantly changing, you get the benefit of instant syncing of your calendar and contacts (this has come in handy from time to time!), the benefit of a more true Gmail experience with the updated app, and only 2 real steps. You can always throw in the &#8220;send-only&#8221; Gmail account, but in my situation, I don&#8217;t find that necessary. Plus, I have a work email in the mail app, so it would be pulling email in anyway whenever I opened the mail app.</p>
<p>Pointless exercise.  And the author never explained any benefit&#8230; Just tight integration.    Lame article.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble setting up the DAV accounts, remember to use the &#8220;&#8221;mailto:username@gmail.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;username@gmail.com</a>&quot; under the User Name field, not just &#8220;username&#8221; with no @gmail.com which typically works on google services.</p>
<p>Just spent too much time figuring that out&#8230;</p>
<p>whoa! yeah, make sure to have @ google.com in the user name field.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s documentation, plus a few pictures. Lazy journalism at its best.</p>
<p>personally i find it easier to install altamail app on my iphone, its worth it to manage my emails!</p>
<p>I can never get contacts to sync right between Apple ecosystem and Google&#8217;s. There&#8217;s always something that&#8217;s broken, sooner or later. I gave up, and went iCloud exclusively for contacts.</p>
<p>Uh, using exchange for Gmail on ios is so iOS 3.0. Gmail, works fine out of the box now, am I the only one to realize this!? And as far as Calendar and Contacts for google, just go to google.com/sync and &#8220;Wala!&#8221; everything syncs (that you choose) w/o having to do all that CALDAV crap (that doesn&#8217;t work).</p>
<p>Part 4 says: &#8220;This time, tap Add Account&#8230; and select Other, and then Add <strong>CardDAV</strong> Account.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I guess you mean CalDAV, right?</p>
<p>Nope. Gmail on iOS is frustrating, at least. The native email client is not the best, but it&#8217;s miles ahead of Gmail at usability. Wow, can&#8217;t believe this comes from the same guys that brought us Chrome.</p>
<p>Syncing contacts was a bad idea for me.  The contacts on my phone are better than the ones in gmail and I just ended up with a bunch of duplicate contacts with no phone number and just an email address.</p>
<p>For those wondering, you can sync your contacts from iOS to Gmail by downloading your contacts from <a href="http://www.icloud.com" target="new">iCloud</a></p>
<p>Go to contacts and click <strong> <br />
Preferences &gt; Select All<br />
Preferences &gt; Export to CSV </strong><br />
(Preferences is a little gear icon in the bottom left)</p>
<p>Then you can import that file into Gmail.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just set all this up, switching from the Exchange solution &#8211; and now my calendar entries are multiplying!! &#8220;Goodbye, weird duplicated events and endless birthday notifications&#8221;?! My experience so far is the opposite.</p>
<p>Ok, so I gave up and switched back to Exchange &#8211; still have this crazy duplicates problem!! No idea what&#8217;s causing it but I now have about 10 copies of each birthday entry and a few of my other Google calendars.</p>
<p>The same thing just happened to me!</p>
<p>I dunno wtf to do. I&#8217;ve deleted all my google accounts. I now have no contacts and no calendar syncing at all. My regular calendars are gone, but I&#8217;m still left with all of my birthdays and the google holidays calendar, with about 20 entries of each event. I can&#8217;t get rid of them. Totally lost now.</p>
<p>Same here. Been trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on for the last couple hours. I have removed all calendars and it&#8217;s still glitching out over birthdays. I have about 10 entries for every birthday. No idea what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>I found this: <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4459110?start=0&tstart=0" target="_blank">https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4459110?start=0&amp;tstart=0</a></p>
<p>Trying this now.</p>
<p>Hey &#8211; thank you for posting this! It&#8217;s always good to see there are others with your problem!</p>
<p>Followed the steps and it eventually cleared out the duplicated events. I&#8217;ve had to leave the Birthday calendar switched off in Google Sync (which is fine because they show up anyway on the phone through the contacts info. I&#8217;ve also had to switch off the Holidays calendar though, which is less convenient. I like to have that info on my phone.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if its possible to select which contact Or "group" you can sync with either the exchange option or the CardDAV option?</p>
<p>I would prefer to set a phone directory contacts folder in gmail and have those people separated from all my contacts. I don’t need contacts added to my phone for someone I will contact twice via email only.</p>
<p>Right now my original contacts are syncing through icloud but I prefer to have my contacts in a neutral place where I can have the ability to add it to any device at any time.</p>
<p><a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70052/what-is-the-best-way-to-set-up-google-mail-contacts-and-calendar-consolidated">This page</a> details the downsides of each of the way to configure iOS stock apps and Google mail, contacts and calendar.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a dogs dinner however:</p>
<p><strong>For email:</strong> use Gmail if you are happy without push or Exchange if you must have push but you&#8217;ll have to accept no flagging, no draft syncing and poor searching.</p>
<p><strong>For calendar:</strong> use CalDav or Gmail if you are happy not to see any subscribed calendars. If you want to see those, then you have to use Exchange but accept that you may find additional newlines ending up in appointment details.</p>
<p><strong>For contacts:</strong> use CardDav.</p>
<p>So I switched to this set up. I like that it pulled my calendar colors from google and you get the double alerts (cal) that you get from the web client. I noticed a downside though. I cannot send invites to events I create on my phone. I imagine this has something to do with CalDAV.</p>
<p>CalDAV does not push. Exchange will. But be aware that if you have more than 1 calendar you have to configure that in a certain way. See here:<br />
<a href="http://www.easy-calendar.com/faq.php#configure-google-calendar" target="new">How to configure Google Calendar on your iPhone</a></p>
<p>Lately there&#8217;s been hoards of Apple articles.  Too much.</p>
<p>Hard to understand why an article would be written like this without explaining the pros and cons of using DAV over Exchange. On a tech site no less.</p>
<p>Many people have had battery life issues with Exchange-iOS.</p>
<p>CardDAV &amp; Google Contacts question:</p>
<p>- Which is the default Google Contacts Group? MyContacts? I have 258 contacts in MyContacts, but IOS (after CardDAV setup) shows 358. What gives here?</p>
<p>- How do I search ALL Google Contacts from IOS now that I am setup with CardDAV? Exchange setup would allow me to do a GLOBAL contacts search from iOS to my Google account, allowing me to search among my 1000+ contacts on Google. This new CardDAV setup does not seem to do that?</p>
<p>Tried to set up CalDAV but it&#8217;s not working. I have my entire email address as the username, SSL is on, and I went to that sync page and the correct calendars are checked. Any ideas at what I&#8217;m missing?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also having trouble setting up CalDAV and CardDAV. Keep getting the &#8220;Cannot Connect Using SSL&#8221; error pop up. Even if I don&#8217;t want to use SSL, it fails verification anyways.</p>
<p>Make sure your username is your entire email address. This fixed the verification issue for me, but I&#8217;m still not seeing my calendars.</p>
<p>Apparently, after searching a bit more, I had to get an &#8220;Application-specific password&#8221; since I enabled the two step authentication to get it working.<br />

<p>Oh my goodness you have to go through all that rigamoru and then cross your fingers and hope for the best?     Wow,  Android and Google services are beautifully intergrated.</p>
<p>and oh until iOS supports widgets it&#8217;ll never be &#8220;just as good&#8221;.     Calander widget is an absoult Godsend on my Android tablet and Nexus.</p>
<p>No, the method described is NOT the best way to integrate gmail and google calendar on the iPhone.</p>
<p>settings &gt;Mail, Contacts, Calendars&gt;Add Account&gt;Exchange</p>
<p>email: your gmail (or hosted account) address<br />
password: duh<br />
description: whatever you want to call it</p>
<p>hit next</p>
<p>Email: leave it be<br />
server: m.google.com<br />
domain: LEAVE THIS BLANK<br />
username: same as email field<br />
password: already entered from previous screen<br />
Description: already entered from previous screen</p>
<p>Hit next</p>
<p>Select Mail, Contacts and Calendars</p>
<p>Hit Save</p>
<p>You can change how many days to sync and which folders to sync from the settings menu.</p>
<p>MUCH MUCH easier (and more reliable) than the simple gmail setting IMO</p>
<p>So I did the CardDav thing and synchronized my contacts. Now if I delete contacts from my iPhone, is there any way to sync that with my Google Contacts and make sure they are deleted there too?</p>
<p>This will not work if you have Google Apps because the iOS Gmail App does not process notifications on the iPhone for Google Apps gmail accounts like it does so elegantly for regular gmail accounts.  too bad.</p>
<p>Google exchange server works perfectly with iPhone. (at least as well as it does on Android, which is not well at all.)  The Iphone mail client is best in the business.  I pity anyone stuck using Google products, trapped in hell of google-aesthetics.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t afford messing up your address book and calendars, I&#8217;d very strongly suggest to not ever use Google for syncing! They completely destroyed everything for me trice! The CalDAV syncing has random spooks, the CardDAV syncing occasionally ignores changes &#8211; and you wont even notice, until it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve basically tried every single service listed on the following to pages and stick with fruux now, which I highly recommend.<br />
<a href="http://carddav.calconnect.org/implementations/providers.html" target="_blank">http://carddav.calconnect.org/implementations/providers.html</a><br />
<a href="http://caldav.calconnect.org/implementations/providers.html" target="_blank">http://caldav.calconnect.org/implementations/providers.html</a></p>
<p>Sad solution. Meh. I&#8217;d stick to exchange instead of bothering with a billion things. Also no idea why u need to use caldav when adding the mail account can automatically set up calendar anyway</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stick with the exchange method for now, thanks.</p>
<p>Much easier to setup and explain to other people.</p>
<p>Also, my mother in law&#8217;s iPhone recently stopped working with the gmail setting and we set it up using exchange without issue.</p>
<p>Gave this a try&#8230; but in checking usage time, usage and standby are registering exactly the same. Anyone else getting this?</p>
<p>The Goog giveth Maps, but the Goog taketh away.</p>
<p>F- Google in the face.</p>
<p>Ye;p. Google is pulling the plug on EAS.</p>
<p>The problem with this whole Caldav solution is the fact that iOS users can no longer invite (or accept invitations) from the native calendar app. This is definitely a significant step backwards for anyone that uses Google services on Apple hardware.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting, have to try it</p>
<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/winter-cleaning.html" target="_blank">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/winter-cleaning.html</a></p>
<p>This article has been a bit of a disappointment coming from theverge!</p>
<p>As pointed out a few times, invitations are NOT compatible with CalDAV.  That means you cannot send out or accept/decline invitations.</p>
<p>Overall there is ZERO advantage using your approach covered here vs ActiveSync.</p>
<p>I have bought a new Iphone and was searching for some way to utilize Gmail on my phone. I must say that this was a very helpful post for me to go through. I would surely share this with my buddies as well.<br />
<a href="http://www.genericviagra123.com/">http://www.genericviagra123.com/</a></p>
<p>I use other email accounts, in addition to my Gmail.  So, I use the native mail app on my Iphone 5 for those accounts.  I set up the &ldquo;send only&rdquo; Gmail account as described, turning off the push notifications and setting the fetch option to &ldquo;manual.&rdquo;  Every time I launch the mail iPhone mail app, I get a message saying &ldquo;Cannot Get Mail.  The user name or password for &lsquo;Gmail&rsquo; is incorrect.&rdquo;  I have verified that the username and password I entered are indeed my correct Gmail username (full email address) and password.  I am also unable send outgoing mail from the Gmail account through the native iPhone mail app.  Any idea what&rsquo;s wrong here?</p>
<p>Has anyone tried setting up CardDAV or CalDAV as here described with 2-Step verification turned on?<br />
I&rsquo;m getting an error message  when I try adding my Google credentials ind CardDAV&hellip;</p>
<p>For CardDAV or CalDAV with 2-step verfication turned on you&rsquo;ll have to set them up on your iPhone using an &ldquo;application-specific password&rdquo;, not your google account password. Here&rsquo;s the link to instructions on how this works. <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=185833" target="_blank">http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=185833</a></p>
<p>Basically, you have to create a one-time password for each application you set up on your iPhone.</p>
<p>would be cool if you could use it as an external monitor</p>

<p>Been watching for 5 minutes.  Still giggling every time.  Damn you.</p>
<p>The technology is already here.  They just need to bring power consumption down.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Google could get away with putting a 3G antenna right up against your temple for 12 hours a day. FCC has been increasingly wary of the radiation issue lately. So I&#8217;m willing to bet instead that it&#8217;ll pair over bluetooth (yes, I know that&#8217;s still radiation) with an Android phone, which means that it only needs enough battery power for the display, BT radio and a small processor. Wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they could fit that in a compelling form factor.</p>
<p>The radiation from 3G radio is non-ionizing. It won&#8217;t do anything harmful to your brain.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an excellent quote: &#8220;Yes, a cell phone will cook your brain the same way that you can cook a turkey by breathing on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>OMG, my wish fulfilled sooner than I expected.  When I first saw Samsung&#8217;s demo of transparent OLED display I knew the next communicator form factor would be eye shades with transparent OLED HUD for the lens and capable of using augmented reality.  Kudos to Google if they can bring this to fruition this year.  This is the next big revolution.</p>
<p>These are those really horrible, Oakley bulky looking, only see out of one lens, glasses that were rumored a month or so ago?</p>
<p>Good thing fandroids will buy anything with &#8220;google&#8221; plastered on it, otherwise google would have to pay people to use these things.</p>
<p>Quintesential Apple fanboy.<br />
&#8220;I have an iPhone and an iPad but Im not a fanboy.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re criticizing a non existent product with no legetimite details.</p>
<p>You criticize &#8220;MS fanboys&#8221; and &#8220;Fandroids&#8221; but dont consider yourself an Apple fanboy becuase you aknowledge the existence of &#8220;iSheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll no shit they exist, you are one.</p>
<p>The only thing worse than a fanboy is one who denies hes one while calling out others on it.</p>
<p>See the first part of my post being a question. That pretty much qualifies the second part as being a criticism only if the first part is true.</p>
<p>Yes I own and iPhone, and an iPad; and a MacBook Pro, a Dell laptop, an Asus netbook with Linux, a Galaxy SII, a home-built Windows7 workstation, and a Kindle Fire. But it&#8217;s only the Apple products that make me a fanboy. Not that you care, but I didn&#8217;t buy the Apple products because of some marketing hype, I bought them because <strong>gasp</strong> they were the best tools for what I needed them to do.</p>
<p>I do enjoy riling sensitive techies up though, by using terms like &#8220;Fandroid&#8221; &#8220;iSheep&#8221; &#8220;fanboys&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>I owned Apple too but found it too dumbed down and limiting.  Good thing for companies that don&#8217;t patent troll like Apple to stifle innovation, competition and consumer choice.  If it was for competition and choice I&#8217;d be forced to carry two devices, a useless 3.5&quot; and a bulky 10&quot;, instead of one pocktable 5&quot; all-in-one or the next revolution eyewear form factor.</p>
<p>Haha, I love how happily you&#8217;re championing that moronic Vu.</p>
<p>Please look up and and understand the phrase &#8220;patent troll&#8221; before posting again. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Bros &amp; ladybros, this is not Engadget. Stop trying to reach the maximum number of replys. Thanks</p>
<p>I know what a lady bra is, but what is a ladybro?</p>
<p>but I like crunching the whitespace!</p>
<p>Now I want to see how far we can take the reply thread, keep it going =]</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s Slapppy from AppleInsider when you need him?</p>
<p>Dude you&#8217;re a barista.</p>
<p>Except Wave.  And Buzz.  And Logitech Reveue.  And a dozen other failed google products.  But ok, sure, &#8220;fandroids&#8221; buy anything that say Google.  Sure.</p>
<p>Well, fan droids do, that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called fan droids. Like HotelQuebec</p>
<p>Am I the only one who liked Google Wave?</p>
<p>I liked it a lot!</p>
<p>I liked it! Just couldn&#8217;t get enough people on board with it.</p>
<p>Loved google wave&#8230; tried to get my high schools stu council to do thier meetings over it&#8230;.</p>
<p>Google TV might have failed for Logitech, but it didn&#8217;t fail for consumers or Google. I freaking love mine and use it very often.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s not the one posting <strong>record profits</strong> for selling overpriced junk in the middle of a recession&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh, wait, you&#8217;re hating on apple because they&#8217;re succeeding? Apple&#8217;s junk is, apparently a lot more useful to consumers than anything Google is selling. Companies selling &#8220;junk&#8221; aren&#8217;t doing well in a recession, and no one with a shred of credibility thinks Apple&#8217;s stuff is overpriced junk.</p>

<p>You misunderstood the fandroid but earlier. That was solely for these useless goggles. Google makes some good products, I pay for some. But a $600 HUD monocle wouldn&#8217;t be one.</p>
<p>And plenty of people buy Apple&#8217;s stuff because they&#8217;re fanboys, but Apple is not posting record profits because it&#8217;s useless junk. It&#8217;s not exactly rocket science.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like your username.</p>
<p>Thank you for that enlightening contribution.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned Apple and non-Apple and have to admit Apple are high priced junk and the fruity logo makes some people feel better about it.</p>
<p>Really, it comes down to what you value in a product. Apple&#8217;s price is not just about the computer components on the inside, but that premium also comes with, arguably, the best customer service/satisfaction in the industry, longer product longevity, higher resale prices, higher build quality, and an OS and ecosystem that is regarded by most to be more approachable and usable for the average consumer. Some people may not value those things, for them, it&#8217;s probably overpriced junk. Yes, I can buy a cheap windows laptop with the same processor/HDD/RAM/etc. as my MacBook Pro, but it won&#8217;t have the high-res screen, the aluminum body, or the ability to retain it&#8217;s value over the years. My MacBook is more durable and will serve me much better in the long run than any of the windows laptops I&#8217;ve ever owned.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s been accurate to say that Apple&#8217;s products are unreasonably overpriced for a long time. Find an equivalent Windows laptop in build quality, unibody construction, and the same internal components, and you&#8217;re also going to be looking at similar prices. But that wouldn&#8217;t go along with the whole &#8220;but I can buy an entry level windows machine for 25% of a MBP&#8221;. Apple doesn&#8217;t make &#8220;entry level&#8221; machines, and they&#8217;ve fully discontinued their lower end MacBook line.</p>
<p>if they integrated Layar, this has the potential to be a boon for travelers.  image walking around a city looking for dinner and you activate layar.  instantly you see all of the restaurants &#8211; and now you can look up reviews all from your glasses.</p>
<p>Sounds great.  So we&#8217;ll not only have idiots talking and texting on their phones completely oblivious to everything around them, now we&#8217;ll have morons too focused on the augmented reality overlays in their glasses to deal with too?</p>
<p>/old man rant.</p>
<p>So you think they should do away with HUD displays in aircrafts because they&#8217;re a hindrance rather than providing more awareness?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s&#8230;that&#8217;s not even close to the same thing.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;</p>
<p>Well&#8230;</p>
<p>If you get distracted by signs, stay away from NY; the place is loaded with distractions.</p>
<p>Oh man. I just see so many people walking directly into traffic though. It&#8217;s bad enough when people try and cross while texting. I can just see people getting nailed trying to cross 6th Ave while having last night&#8217;s Glee projected onto their retina.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s far easier to tune out signs and other imagery that are not directly in your field of vision because it&#8217;s being broadcast in your glasses.</p>
<p>You have more faith in people than I do if you think that people will be smart enough to do so themselves and won&#8217;t be self-absorbed idiots, as evidenced by the number of people who think talking or texting while driving is okay because they&#8217;re perfectly capable of multi-tasking.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it hurt your eyes to have a screen so close?</p>
<p>WANT. WANT. WANT.</p>
<p>Assuming I can put prescription shit in there somehow cause I&#8217;m pretty blind. Haha</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;. Recon has been working on a similar product for a while &#8211; saw it at CES. <br />
<a href="http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/mod" target="_blank">http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/mod</a></p>
<p>But their purpose is yet fully centered in sports. As far as I understood, this new Google Goggles (lol) are to be used by anyone, to interact like we normally do on our phones.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Google will make them look more like regular fashion eye wear or partner with companies like Dolce&amp;Gabbana, etc.</p>

I can see that Google&#8217;s power level is rising</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8230; it&#8217;s Over 9000!!!</p>
<p>Over NYAN thousand!!!!</p>

<p>if they made this&#8230; i would buy and where it.</p>
<p>Wear would you where it if it whir you&#8217;res?</p>
<p>Experiment? Why dont they just look at the failures from the past 15 years and save the embarrassment of yet another unfinished/half assed project. Here&#8217;s what they should do. Go out and buy a pair of regular glasses/sunglasses. Put them on the table and ask, &#8220;ok how do we fit a smartphone into the glasses without modifying the glasses?&#8221; Someone will say, &#8220;it cant be done yet.&#8221; Therefore the project should be delayed another 5 years. Try something a little easier ,like goggles for snowboarders or something.</p>
<p>Google hasn&#8217;t even been around for 15 years. And who cares if it doesn&#8217;t succeed; it looks awesome!</p>
<p>You completely misread what I said. Look at the head-up display failures from the past 15 years. Hell you can go all the way back to the late 80&#8217;s failures. The tech isn&#8217;t ready yet.</p>
<p>It probably isn&#8217;t ready, but if they can do it and do it decently it would be incredibly awesome.</p>
<p>I think the tech probably isn&#8217;t quite there yet, but it&#8217;s hard to say.  PCBs are small enough you could fit one inside regularish glasses without a noticeable size increase.  The battery though, I&#8217;m not so sure about where you fit that into the mix and not have them become absurdly huge.</p>
<p>How about something like what Vegeta wore when he first came to Earth in DBZ, that is good looking enough, have enough place for a battery and also leave your one eye free to see things around you solving another problem which people are saying it can cause(not focusing on things around you) and it can be even stripped of the 3G Antenna and used as a headset with any phone by using with Bluetooth.</p>
<p>You are right. They should just stop inventing and trying new things. Companies that try new things are insane.</p>
<p>No one said anything about not inventing new things. If you want to buy a half assed piece of tech then jump all over this thing. All Im saying is the tech isnt right for the average consumer to go crazy over. If you want to know what these thing are gonna be like I suggest you find some Oakleys from the 80&#8217;s and shine a light in both eyes.</p>
<p>What if they do something like I said just above.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t we see what they actually deliver before writing it off as the same old thing that failed?</p>
<p>Voice interfaces have failed over an even longer stretch, but that didn&#8217;t stop Apple from revisiting one and trying to improve on previous attempts.</p>
<p>if every time someone said &#8220;it can&#8217;t be done&#8221; meant that you stopped trying&#8230; nothing would ever be created.</p>
<p>also, those goggles exist, Recon Instruments: <a href="http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/mod" target="_blank">http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/mod</a></p>
<p>Great point. Additionally, why are they wasting time creating a product they have zero intent on monetizing? Makes no sense.</p>
<p>Google has already stated many times, but:<br />
1) make cool stuff now, monetize it later<br />
2) even if it doesn&#8217;t make money directly, people using other google products are many many times more likely to use google as their search engine</p>
<p>I need these more than the desert needs the rain.</p>
<p>deserts don&#8217;t need a whole lot of rain. Rain forests, however&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll buy them if they put it in a motorcycle helmet. I suck with directions.</p>
<p>Honda has a new car, we don&#8217;t know too much about it, but it has four wheels, an engine, and it costs somewhere between 25 and 60k. Is everybody excited or what?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s everyone wait until there&#8217;s a story to report. I probably would&#8217;ve been excited about Bluetooth headsets and pocket-liberating phone holsters if I hadn&#8217;t seen people wearing them first.</p>
<p>Except that this is an entirely new product and not just another car, but yeah great analogy.  (Not at all).</p>
<p>Oh man. I hope it&#8217;s as awesome and usable as I think it&#8217;ll be. Really hoping we see this at Google I/O, or even earlier.</p>
<p>You know the one thing that no one seems to be mentioning, something like this would need an unlimited data plan and a fast HSPA+ or LTE connection&#8230; Here is the major problem as this is something you would always wear and would always be in use</p>
<p>Not really. Most likely you can turn it off like you would an AR app.</p>
<p>The last I read only one lens was transparent. Hope that was false or they have updated models. Being Google though I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they were monocular, Google doesn&#8217;t really get the CE market.</p>
<p><strong>sips tea</strong> &#8220;The weather today looks quite dreary&#8221; while looking at the weather report on the internet.</p>
<p>Google Goggles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably buy it just to play with it.</p>
<p>But I have a disposable income and love gadgets.</p>
<p>If these look like a regular pair of glasses and have decent battery life, they will succeed. If not, forget it. I have a feeling these are going to look like the awful Lady Gaga Polaroid glasses that were huge.</p>
<p>Has anyone read <em>Daemon</em>. <strong>It&#8217;s Beginging</strong></p>
<p>Glad they narrowed it down from 1 to 100000000 to 250-600&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s based on the same idea as the Kopin Golden-i, currently being mass manufactured by Motorola Solutions (the part of Motorola Google isn&#8217;t buying) for industrial use (people working in industry needing headmounted computing, preferably not carrying around a tablet or laptop). I actually showed it to Sergey Brin and Steve Lee and other Google X people at CES, here&#8217;s a 27-minute demo of how it works: <a href="http://armdevices.net/2012/01/14/motorola-kopin-golden-i-at-the-verizon-booth-at-ces-2012/" target="_blank">http://armdevices.net/2012/01/14/motorola-kopin-golden-i-at-the-verizon-booth-at-ces-2012/</a> and a bit about how I try to use it for augmented video-blogging: <a href="http://armdevices.net/2011/11/14/list-of-my-arm-powered-devices-used-for-video-blogging/" target="_blank">http://armdevices.net/2011/11/14/list-of-my-arm-powered-devices-used-for-video-blogging/</a></p>
<p>The Google one I think  is going to be more compact (just about foldable and to be put in ones pocket), run Android instead of Windows CE (industry needs Windows CE) thus having all the augmented reality apps available on the Android platform already such as Google+, Ustream uploader, augmented reality apps, Google Goggles etc. Getting this to work is mostly about software, the hardware is &#8220;just&#8221; a microdisplay from Kopin for example, at least 800&#215;600 resolution up close to one of your eyes. It actually doesn&#8217;t have to be glasses, making it sunglasses is just a better way to hide the hardware. But without glasses it can be made as small as a couple bluetooth headsets extractable from one of your ears when you want to use it. It&#8217;s basically kind of like putting your phone up close to your eye, mostly with same processing and sensors as on your phone, and with this you are being hands free so you can more easily walk around, hold other things, do other stuff. Consider it like a dashboard to your lift, not as much as something you constantly look through, more like something you can glance down on when you need augmented info, otherwise just look with the other eye or straight ahead for a view without anything augmented.</p>
<p>Dennou Coil!</p>
<p>And they must be using this :<br />
<a href="http://scimad.com/transistor/">http://scimad.com/transistor/</a></p>
<p>Im in, if they are affordable.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll be able to add a 3G antenna to the glasses. My guess is it&#8217;ll have a bluetooth antenna and all data will be pulled from a phone &#8212; Android of course! <br />
The new bluetooth standards are much faster and can transfer video and voice with ease to a paired device</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait!</p>
<p>This is what Recon Instruments is already doing for Ski/Snowboard googles.  MOD live works with Android phones and hopefully iOS very soon.  My Guess is this will just be a HUD and it will interface with your phone via Bluetooth, But I guess anything is possible.</p>
<p>Anybody read Daemon by Daniel Suarez (and Freedom)? Cause I new that Google wanted to rewrite the world&#8230;..</p>
<p>This product is out of imagination can&#8217;t believe google is into such a good product, if this project comes into existance im sure it would take our world into next generation, what an imagination and what an effort for this wonderful peoduct hats off to google. I got to know the srtucture of this google glass released from this sit &#8220;http://tech2wonder.com/google-glasses.html&#8221; im not sure whether the structure is perfect given by them..</p>
<p>Wii U is finished.</p>
<p>Smart Glass allows existing devices to act as a second touch screen.</p>
<p>And if you check my history I championed Wii U &#8211; but if the current gen Xbox can do this with your existing devices. Well, duh, it&#8217;s game over.</p>
<p>Yeah it really takes all the wind out of the sails for that new controller, though I think we&#8217;ll see much better use of that second screen on the Wii U.</p>
<p>Possibly better. And the hardware will still be better.</p>
<p>Still, a punch to Nintendo&#8217;s gut to be sure.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure.. This will probably see most of its utility in navigation and very little will be grounded in gaming itself, where Nintendo&#8217;s gamepad and all those glorious buttons will be home to some pretty decent game mechanics and control schemes.</p>
<p>People will still buy Nintendo for their small children.  Most people don&#8217;t view the Wii as a serious gaming machine.  The one in our home is just used to watch Netflix now.</p>
<p>How are those hd movies</p>
<p>If he said it&#8217;s for small children I imagine he doesn&#8217;t care that it&#8217;s not HD.</p>
<p>Netflix doesn&#8217;t have HD? You&#8217;re right, I never noticed or really cared.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re basing this off of the current Wii&#8217;s public perception, which is in and of itself, flawed. You can&#8217;t predict how the WiiU will be received or what kind of content it will support.</p>
<p>What we know is that Nintendo is going to try to position this as what teenage boys refer to as a &#8220;serious gaming machine&#8221;.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for Nintendo but the walls are closing in around them. With 360&#8217;s media games and other content combined with Kinect and now extra screens, and even a 99 dollar package to get started I think this will be a bloodbath&#8230; Nintendo will likely turn into Sega by next generation and make games for Sony and MS&#8230;</p>
<p>Really depends on how much this takes off.  Game developers for Wii U will focus more on the screen since it&#8217;s part of the default controller, whereas I could see game developers ignoring SmartGlass since it&#8217;s more of an &#8216;add on&#8217; type of thing.  Hopefully everyone embraces it though.  What they need is for Halo 4 / Madden to utilize it in some cool and interesting ways that make people want to use it. Then the other developers will follow once it has the attention of consumers and gamers.</p>
<p>I was just about to type this. Thank you for typing it, so I can just say I totally agree with this. Wii U&#8217;s screen is permanent. This is optional. The developer has to put extra effort into it.</p>
<p>They demonstrated Madden.</p>
<p>However, one thing I didn&#8217;t see from Smart Glass was the ability to actually display video &#8211; such as a different perspective or a portable display that allows you to play if you are away from the TV.</p>
<p>I think that that was more of an example than an actual demo.</p>
<p>Funny enough I wrote about this yesterday on the Wii Pad post.</p>
<p>Both Microsoft and Sony could come up with a way of using other devices but that&#8217;s not a standard, developers won&#8217;t look at it as a standard, the Kinect is out there for quite a while and just now they are really starting to use it more properly.</p>
<p>One thing is sure, you can&#8217;t use it as a standard and assume everyone has a smartphone and a tablet. So you can only build extras for the tablet, it can&#8217;t be a requirement. And extras also cost money, so, it&#8217;s not as simple as people think.</p>
<p>So I find it a bit hard to simply put that the Wii U is over like many will do, still too soon.</p>
<p>Only problem is by the time the Wii U launches this fall there will be 70 million Xbox 360s deployed and what percentage of those will also have a iPhone, iPad, Android device, Windows 8 device or a Windows Phone?  If you are a developer do you target the maybe 2 million Wii Us sold this year or the likely 10 million+ Xbox 360 and some mobile devices?</p>
<p>According to the article, the extended game functionality is only for Windows tablets and phones.</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s how I read it.</p>
<blockquote>The enhanced video experience will be available for all versions of the app, though it will apply only to Xbox Live content. The extended game functionality, however, was specifically noted as being for Windows 8 tablets and Windows Phone devices.</blockquote>
<p>The way you read it is the only way to read it.  Looks like they&#8217;re creating a closed ecosystem for themselves.  I think  it&#8217;s a smart move.  Google needs to pump out some hardware or they&#8217;ll be left in the wind of incompatible third party devices.</p>
<p>Sorry but I watched the presentation streaming live and this is completely wrong. I don&#8217;t know where the Verge writer got this from. They made it abundantly clear these features were available on iOS and android.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll get the basic functions but the extended functions will be exclusive.</p>
<p>Developers making exclusive Xbox 360 games, that might be right, but that group includes&#8230; well almost no one not owned/tied to Microsoft&#8230; so you&#8217;d think if MS wanted to push this, they would all have smart glass features.</p>
<p>The main issue with Wii U and Smart Glass is cross platform third party titles. Whereas before a game being released on 360, PS3 and Wii U would have specific &#8220;extra features&#8221; on Wii-U (map on screen, touch screen inventory etc) that will now be ported across to smart glass too. Sony announced that the Vita will soon be usable as a PS3 controller so count them in as well. Suddenly the Wii-U has no &#8220;special bonus&#8221; when it comes to cross platform games.</p>
<p>Despite this Verge report, I watched the presentation streaming live and they made it abundantly clear that the gaming features would be available on ipad, iphone, android and android tablets and well as Windows devices, so I really have no idea where the news writer is getting the idea this is for Win8 and WP only???</p>
<p>The key point is, and they kept hammering it home, is that every (or almost every) 360 user already had the accessory, any smart phone or tablet will offer a 360 user these extra features. So just like the Wii &#8211; every user WILL have access to the second screen.</p>
<p>As a 360 owner who was strongly considering a Wii-U to get the &#8220;definitive&#8221; version of cross platform games, this is a big blow to Nintendo.</p>
<p>Think about this.</p>
<p>The WiiPad is also a controller, not just a tablet, you can play games with it, not just with the touchscreen, right?</p>
<p>What are you going to do with the Smart Glass? Hold a Xbox controller AND a tablet?! That seems pretty impractical.</p>
<p>So, it won&#8217;t be used as the same way as WiiPad and as much as Microsoft tried to show how it could work in demos, only a second person would be able to use the tablet because I doubt that you will be able to play the entire game just with the touchscreen.</p>
<p>People who own xbox&#8217;s won&#8217;t use smart glass because it was not designed for the Xbox from day one. Wii u will mostly have better functionality and games will work better with it.</p>
<p>extremely weak argument&#8230; your fanboi is showing&#8230;</p>
<p>lolwut dude?</p>
<p>Well considering how every one already has a tablet or smartphone developers will strongly consider it for xbox games too.</p>
<p>Good point. I hope they do. I&#8217;m not an Xbox gamer though. I game on my iPad and ps3. Waiting for Sony to bring something that will make me happier.</p>
<p>I feel like this feature isn&#8217;t going to be  as useful as the hype. The Halo Waypoint app for the iPad has a feature that lets you use the tablet screen as a map for the level with info on teammate positions and weapon spawns. I&#8217;ve tried a number of times to use it, but it adds very little to the experience. Looking at the tablet screen while playing is a sure fire way to get yourself killed. it&#8217;s mostly just frustrating.</p>
<p>True, Halo has been too action-oriented for this kind of thing. Something more like Rainbow Six (real Rainbow Six) would be great though.</p>
<p>I think the biggest problem is changing  focus from the TV on the other side of the room, to the tablet sitting right in front of you. Any game that asks you to keep changing back and forth between the two is going to have to pay special attention to how disorienting that can be. .</p>
<p>Would be interesting to see usage based on a co-op perspective though. Sort of like Battlefield, where a commander has a top down view and can organize attacks and strikes while Xbox players go FPS.</p>
<p>That would be where Smart Glass would be limited, at least based on the functionality we saw. The Wii U could have a better top-down view with live graphics from the console &#8211; Smart Glass would have a static map with icons moving around showing the units.</p>
<p>Wii-U <em>could</em> have more graphically complex stuff on screen, but there is a see-saw affect with the quality of graphics on-screen. There&#8217;s only one processor.</p>
<p>The problem with looking away from the screen exists with Wii-U too, hell it exists with looking at the onscreen HUD and away from the action and is why these sorts of features on a fast paced action game will never be useful.</p>
<p>In other games they will. Take a sprawling open world RPG &#8211; rather than having to pause and navigate to a map every five minutes, it&#8217;s on your mobile phone on your arm rest.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that the Smart Glass will be on a separate device. Let&#8217;s go back to the action game, where neither the Wii-U not Smart Glass will be useful for a single player. Now with Smart Glass you can hand your ipad or whatever to a &#8220;wing man&#8221; who can change items for you, play navigator with your map, boost your health when needed. Would certainly be more fun that just watching your friend or partner play a game.</p>
<p>Could just hand the Wii U controller to your friend and use the other controller they just announced &#8211; although that would be extra money.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t very useful because all it showed was 1) weapons and 2) teammate locations. It didn&#8217;t show enemy locations or anything like that. After you&#8217;ve played halo for a while, you know where all the weapons are. And you can tell where your teammates are since they&#8217;re icons are on the screen all the time. So in a lot of ways it is pointless.</p>
<p>In a stealthbased game it would be more useful. Or maybe something as simple as showing you enemy locations &#8211; but only when you&#8217;re dead and waiting to respawn. A good time to pause and look at your second screen.</p>
<p>their*</p>
<p>It will only be useful with a dock placed right in front of you I think.</p>
<p>or a (Win8) laptop?</p>
<p>Or on your coffee table or lap if its your phone&#8230;.</p>
<p>Wii U is a superior concept for the same reason that the Wii Remote is better than the Playstation Move: it&#8217;s included in the box with every system. 100% availability means better developer support.</p>
<p>Every Wii U game will be able to have heavy emphasis on the gamepad screen without any worry of limiting their potential market. SmartGlass will be an optional add-on feature for a few games, but as long as the game needs to be playable without it there&#8217;s a limit to how much innovation can be done.</p>
<p>You know what else drives developer support? Sales. The 360 sells games, the Wii did not.</p>
<p>This is a huge blow to Nintendo for every 3rd party publisher..    It makes forced wii u tablet support in Nintendo world look risky while supplemental tablet support in Xbox land look low risk.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that.</p>
<p>More like it means developers will limit what they do on Wii U based on what Smart Glass can do.</p>
<p>Even a lazy approach to the gamepad will allow the gamepad to interact with the game in real time.  Latency and fragmentation issues are going to prevent much the the real-time game interaction that could occur with a more controlled (no pun intended) developer environment for Smartglass.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, its a cool feature, but you are way over-stating how much it steps on Nintendo&#8217;s toes.</p>
<p>I do agree now that I&#8217;ve digested this that Nintendo&#8217;s implementation will be technologically superior.</p>
<p>But if Smart Glass is properly executed and promoted it may not matter that it isn&#8217;t as good. If people come away believing they are getting the same thing without spending $300-$400 on a Wii U then they won&#8217;t buy a Wii U.</p>
<p>Except that&#8217;s how much people would have to pay for just a tablet (if not more), forget having to also buy an XBox.  No, Nintendo definitely also has the value proposition here&#8230; I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s legitimately in question.</p>
<p>You can say that&#8217;s not really the case because XBox has a large install base already, but there are a lot more people who don&#8217;t have an xbox than those that do, and they will go for the cheaper option if it gives an approximate experience (especially if it gives a superior experience in some regards).</p>
<p>Like I said, no one is eating anyone&#8217;s lunch here.  I think the services are differentiateable enough that it will come down to less decisive factors like personal preference and brand loyalty.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s available on all smart phones as well as tablets. That&#8217;s their major selling point &#8211; you already own it.</p>
<p>Considering Microsoft&#8217;s track record with Kinect (practically every new 360 game has some kind of kinect integration), I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll do the same with smartglass.</p>
<p>This. If Microsoft pulls this off correctly (which I&#8217;m sure they will), the Wii U is dead. Connecting my existing tablet to my existing Xbox is MUCH more appealing that buying a new Wii with a locked down tablet-esque controller.</p>
<p>Well not really. Every Wii U comes with a tablet while maybe 2% of all 360 owner have a tablet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d venture to say that&#8217;ll be way higher than 2%.</p>
<p>Even if it is, that&#8217;s 1.3 million units. Wii U won&#8217;t do much better than that this year.</p>
<p>2%???<br />
&#8220;Microsoft plans to make SmartGlass available on as many platforms as possible — including Windows 8 computers, of course — as well as on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices&#8221;<br />
That&#8217;ll be more like 100%</p>
<p>But the enhanced game features will be limited to Windows Phones and Tablets&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, apparently that&#8217;s the case. Which means the percentage is even smaller&#8230; Making my point even more valid. Developers will just ignore this feature on 360 while every Wii U developer will make use of the GamePad.</p>
<p>No, no, no,no. This is utter misinformation, it&#8217;s available on all platforms.</p>
<p>I think this could help Nintendo in a way.  If devs can take advantage of this kinda tech on multiple systems it will certainly encourage its implementation into more 3rd party games.   Something we can all agree is Nintendo&#8217;s biggest weakness.</p>
<p>I only want to know what took so damn long.  I was thinking about this a couple of years ago, and I know I&#8217;m not the one.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; give me Fallout 4 and a Pip-boy on my smartphone!</p>
<p>It makes so much sense though, why bother building a controller when there&#8217;s plenty of devices that will do the same. Now there;s no reason to purchase a Wii U, I can play all my previous games, and have all the benefits of the wii u controller. Perhaps waggle controls can even be used using your devices accelerometers.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that. The functionality we saw in the concepts was much more limited than any of that, all of which is functionality in the Wii U controller.</p>
<p>The thing is it doesn&#8217;t have to be if Microsoft can convince people that Smart Glass is doing some of the same things.</p>
<p>The thing is it doesn’t have to be if Microsoft can convince people that Smart Glass is doing most or all of the same things. They just have to make sure people think it&#8217;s the same, even if it actually isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a counter-argument: Isn&#8217;t Nintendo really about game design, child-friendly content, and their extremely popular trademarked characters, like Mario and Donkey Kong?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what they&#8217;re trying to be about with Wii U. But it may play out that way, again.</p>
<p>This is like saying now the Wii was finished once the Playstation got Move. If your platform isn&#8217;t focus on one feature majority of users won&#8217;t use it and thus no game developers will barely make use of this feature.</p>
<p>Move looked horrible and like a me too feature,. Kinect was the impressive accessory.</p>
<p>PS: The Move and Kinect releases basically coincide with the Wii&#8217;s sales collapse. So maybe it really was finished with their release.</p>
<p>Yeah but think about this.</p>
<p>The WiiPad is also a controller, not just a tablet, you can play games with it, not just with the touchscreen, right?</p>
<p>what are you going to do with the Smart Glass? hold a Xbox controller AND a tablet?! That seems pretty impractical.</p>
<p>AirPlay clone.</p>
<p>AirPlay is tarted up DLNA anyway. Can&#8217;t clone something that is itself a clone of existing functionality.</p>
<p>This can be pretty much said for every Apple &#8220;innovation&#8221; .  Apple has never been much of an innovator, they are just really good at implementing ideas more effectively.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really a fair assessment.  I think taking something that no one wants or uses and making into a viable usable product is still innovation. Must of what the iPhone is already existed but put it all together and create some new ideas made it a great product.  Maybe even.. innovative??</p>
<p>&quot; taking something that no one wants or uses and making into a viable usable product&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s called renovation.</p>
<p>Crappy dump of a house&#8230; no one buys.  Make it better&#8230; someone buys.  Renovate.</p>
<p>So what do you call the neighbor who builds the exact same house.</p>
<p>DLNA was being used.</p>
<p>DLNA is a standard with guidelines as to how to implement AV streaming using UPnP. DLNA is an implementation to accomplish wireless/wired streaming. It wasn&#8217;t an invention in itself but a set of guidelines as to how to accomplish AV streaming.</p>
<p>AirPlay similar to DLNA also accomplishes UPnP in a different manner; though being highly efficient and easy to setup and use. Saying AirPlay is tarted up DLNA is factually and patently wrong.</p>
<p>I disagree with MegaM though; well not completely. AirPlay like DLNA was an invention to accomplish AV streaming in different ways. SmartGlass is very very similar to AirPlay accomplishing AV Streaming through UPnP.</p>
<p>Now just because you hate something, doesn&#8217;t change any facts.</p>
<blockquote>AirPlay similar to DLNA also accomplishes UPnP in a different manner</blockquote>
<p>See, tarted up DLNA.</p>
<p>So basically you don&#8217;t even understand (even when explained) what AirPlay/DLNA/UPnP is.</p>
<p>Fabulous.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t really matter whether they started with UPNP or if they built on DLNA if the end result is just a refined version of DLNA.</p>
<p>Which further reassures that you just simply don&#8217;t like Apple or AirPlay and with or without understanding, will say anything you think is right, right?</p>
<p>Seriously&#8230;does every article have to turn into an argument about Apple?</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea mate. It bugged me when such an offensive word was used to describe an Apple service which isn&#8217;t even factually true. I didn&#8217;t want to stretch the conversation but wanted to analyse if the person making such comments even knew what he was talking about. Apparently, not.</p>
<p>Except AirPlay actually works decently</p>
<p>Oh, you only belong to the Apple Core.  I guess that&#8217;s why you never heard of DLNA.  Wiki it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t group the whole Apple Core group in with this Troll.</p>
<p>I wish. This only works for content being streamed from Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live servers. It isn&#8217;t half as useful as AirPlay.</p>
<p>This is what I was wondering. You can stream just about anything from your device or the internet with AirPlay. How much media will you really be able to stream to your Xbox?</p>
<p>Wtf they are not making this an exclusive windows 8 feature ? What are you smoking Microsoft oO</p>
<p>The Xbox division doesn&#8217;t care, they want to win the gaming market.</p>
<p>Consumers win too, I would much rather buy an iPad to use as my smartglass than a shitty spec win8 tablet (atleast none from Asus/Acer so far are in the same league)</p>
<p>Did they mention that you could use an iPad? I&#8217;m just reading along and didn&#8217;t catch that.</p>
<p>From the liveblog: &#8220;Works with Windows, iOS and Android phones and tablets. Makes TV more engaging and games more thrilling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes they mentioned over and over that it could be used with any device and specifically mentioned iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Yea.  I own an iOS device and I wouldn&#8217;t switch to WP or Win8 to use this but it might make me pick a 360 over the competition.</p>
<p>Will be on your iOS device</p>
<p>Not all the functions.</p>
<p>They are smoking the &#8220;we don&#8217;t want this to be a flop&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah well Microsoft usually hasn&#8217;t taken that approach in the mobile field (Kin / Zune).  I guess they are finally thinking clearly, all it took was some weed :P</p>
<p>They may still restrict certain features to Windows Phones/Tablets, but I hope not.</p>
<p>Sounds like the in-game features are for windows devices only.</p>
<p>I think the XBox division is more of a separate entity inside of Microsoft, and they want this thing to be a success.  They want XBox to dominate your living room, they want people buying XBox&#8217;s as content consumption boxes instead of just gaming machines.  They can integrate Windows 8 with XBox in other ways once the living room is dominated.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re smoking a joint of reality. A reality in which Android and iOS comprise 80+% of the portable smart device market.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d be fools to do so. It will only survive if people use it. Not enough WinPho and Win8 tablets uin the wild to make it exclusive</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great that it is going to work with multiple tablets and phones.</p>
<p>I brought a Xbox. I love it. But why should I be punished for owning a iPad for example. Not just some bragging right for Win8 users.</p>
<p>This is pretty smart, they took away the big feature of the Wii U with devices people already own with better screens than the Wii U controller (and capacitive touch)</p>
<p>The game support on this is a huge slap in the face to Nintendo. Also, it looks awesome.</p>
<p>Microsoft are kicking fucking arse man, this is the future.</p>
<p>WOW and OMFG WOW. What code was steve talking about?</p>
<p>Huge win by having it be cross device compatible. I bet Windows Phone OS will have some small enhancements and get updates first that&#8217;ll push some users over to Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Yep, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll have super major features exclusive to Window Phones but minor things that matter like, for example, Halo Waypoint (with the ATLAS thing) being free on Windows Phone but $4.99 on other platforms etc.</p>
<p>As long as this comes to my iPad and to goddamn Canada, I&#8217;m super happy. This and Nike+ coming to Xbox is killing me with excitement!</p>
<p>This also happens to be my vision of the Apple iTV;<br />
Apple delivers a television and an iPad included, which functions as a remote and a second screen in which more content can be discovered and interacted with. The iPad is always in connection with the television, and the television streams extra content to the iPad depending on which show you&#8217;re watching (such as maps of the environment in series, voting for talent shows, playing along with a game show). The iPad also serves as the remote, with all the options and menus of the television, so the screen of the television is almost exclusively for content, and the menus, extras and that kind of stuff are streamed to the iPad.</p>
<p>Well if that&#8217;s your iTV vision then it&#8217;s quite interesting that you can get exactly what you envision already with the devices you already own &#8211; or could own for less than the cost of a new TV.</p>
<p>I know you could do something vaguely like that right now but nobody really offers a tightly integrated package like that, or they&#8217;re really crappy experiences.</p>
<p>Not right now, but Smart Glass looks pretty darn tightly integrated &#8211; even with the wide device support.</p>
<p>True, iTV could be tighter still. But you&#8217;ll also be limited to Apple devices.</p>
<p>Wondering about integration. Will it be able to play any video from your device (or the Internet), or is it limited to Xbox approved media only?</p>
<p>Well the one demo featured Game of Thrones on HBO Go. So there is at least an API there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Console&#8221; is a dead word.  Which is fine by me.  I&#8217;m amazed Call of Duty didn&#8217;t open the show.  Microsoft at least gets points for NOT having Activision on stage.</p>
<p>Lots of fitness, music and movie previews.  Other than Tomb Raider, they don&#8217;t seem to be pushing games like they used to.</p>
<p>You spoke too soon there. They&#8217;re on stage right now.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>Xbox Live Gold required?</p>
<p>for ~$3 a month i really dont see everyon&#8217;e beef with this even if it&#8217;s necessary.  And i&#8217;d say it&#8217;s VERY likely</p>
<p>Others do it for free. If you&#8217;ve already payed for the media/ streaming service, why do I need to pay MS for the privledge of watching it on an Xbox? My TV doesn&#8217;t charge me a subscription fee, nor does Roku or AppleTV. Xbox Live Gold being required for media capabilities is pretty tough to justify. Especially when they have more ads than any other system as well.</p>
<p>But they&#8217;ll pay, they all pay.  Nearly everyone I know with an xbox pays a subscription already. My kid has one.. so yea I pay.</p>
<p>Extended game functionality only on windows 8 devices? Huge bummer.</p>
<p>yea</p>
<p>Extended game functionality only on windows 8 devices? Huge bummer.</p>
<p>yea yea</p>
<p>This is clearly Microsoft&#8217;s response to Wii U, some are already saying that the Wii U is dead, but I would think through it a bit more instead that this plain, shallow conclusion off the bat.</p>
<p>Funny enough I wrote about this yesterday on the Wii Pad post. Both Microsoft and Sony could come up with a way of using other devices but that&#8217;s not a standard, developers won&#8217;t look at it as a standard, the Kinect is out there for quite a while and just now they are really starting to use it more properly.</p>
<p>One thing is sure, you can&#8217;t use it as a standard and assume everyone has a smartphone and a tablet. So you can only build extras for the tablet, it can&#8217;t be a requirement to solve things as it can on the Wii U. And extras also cost money, so, it&#8217;s not as simple as people think.</p>
<p>So I find it a bit hard to simply put that the Wii U is over like many will do, still too soon.</p>
<p>Only Nintendo can develop its games with the Wii Pad as a standard, for 3rd party cross platform companies having a tablet as an option is a better deal &#8211; which means dedicated resources to wii pad is that much more costly..</p>
<p>Well, not really. It&#8217;s like you are saying that it costs more to develop for the Wii, because it had a different controller so every body would have to develop that part of controller as something different.</p>
<p>Wii Pad is part of the process of developing a game for Wii U, not something apart, which means there is no way you can separate its cost from the game, you will make every game thinking about the Wii Pad, it&#8217;s part of the game and that&#8217;s how it works for everybody, not just Nintendo.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you make a for a tablet as something extra to interact with the game, in the PS/Xbox case, you have constantly think that it can&#8217;t be something that will help too much or that it can be something that the player may never use. It&#8217;s a totally different approach.</p>
<p>This is great. It also allows current iOS and Android users to consider using a Windows Phone or Windows 8 device in the near future. Anything multiplatform is pretty much like a Trojan horse.</p>
<p>Silly name and I just don&#8217;t see how you can use a tablet AND play a game at the same time? I&#8217;d have a Wii U over this any day of the week.</p>
<p>I love that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t lock things down like Apple. Huge win for everyone. This is one of the biggest raesons why I support MS and buy their products.</p>
<p>the pc os doesn&#8217;t but we&#8217;re entering hardware territory built by MS themselves here so I see them closing the doors already.</p>
<p>Was impressed with it tbh, the Microsoft ecosystem looks decent,</p>
<p>Jame</p>
<p>I always used to think that smooth wireless interoperability was the one thing that theMS ecosystem lacked and whaddya know they pretty much answered my prayers here</p>
<p>Easily the coolest thing MS announced at E3.</p>
<p>Bye bye, shitty WiiU</p>
<p>Hear that? Thats the funeral march for Wii U! This looks really cool!</p>
<p>Hmmm, so I wanna get something clarified here. With SmartGlass, will I be able to more easily and more seamlessly load up a clip on my PC but have it play on my TV through XBOX?</p>
<p>that&#8217;s the idea&#8230;</p>
<p>You can already do this on Windows 8 even, it just doesn&#8217;t have the Smart Glass name right now.</p>
<p>I may have missed something here.  The opening line is &#8220;The rumors are true&#8221; but from the article, I get the impression that it&#8217;s not.  One of the most exciting features to me was the standard &#8220;dump&#8221; apple tv like feature.  I have a video on my tablet/phone.  It has no connection to xbox live what so ever.  I still can stream it to my xbox on the big screen.  I don&#8217;t see this mentioned in any article I&#8217;ve read.  It seems like it&#8217;s only Zune/Xbox content that you can do that on.  Unfortunate if true.</p>
<p>The secondary screen using SmartGlass on games/video has to be an option, mostly non-critical option because these devices are not a standard part of the console. I don&#8217;t think a game can &#8220;require&#8221; you to have a Windows Phone or a Windows 8 tablet. It will totally limit their audience.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why not. Some games require special controllers.  This is not that much different.</p>
<p>Windows Sideshow all over again. It&#8217;s amazing what people will get excited over.</p>
<p>Cmd+f iPad</p>
<p>Fail</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.</p>
<p>You should have saved that golden quote for a bigger troll, just sayin</p>
<p>Just goes to show how Japan is no longer leader in tech. MS has prototyped, developed, iterated and will bring to market the same (and even suprerior some might say) functionality in half the time it took Nintendo to get their WiiU to market. This is pretty sad. Nintendo and the rest of the Japanese companies are being left in the dust. They need a serious culture change over there, more urgency, more entrepreneurial spirit. If no seachange arrives soon, Japan will soon fall further and further behind. Korea also needs to invest heavily in its software engineering. They can only rely on their hardware for so long, until what happened to Japan happens to them too.</p>
<p>Possibly even less than half the time. It&#8217;s also just software and an online service. Smart Glass is clearly not superior to the Wii U functionality, anyone that would say so is delusional.</p>
<p>Consoles and hardware take more time to develop <strong>correctly</strong> than software (yes I know the original Xbox was basically done in half the normal time, it was also very nearly off-the-shelf stuff and bottlenecked). There is still plenty of entrepreneurial spirit and ingenuity over there &#8211; we&#8217;re just seeing older companies like Toyota, Sony, and Nintendo (especially with GameCube) get complacent and conservative.</p>
<p>Think about this.</p>
<p>The WiiPad is also a controller, not just a tablet, you can play games with it, not just with the touchscreen, right?</p>
<p>What are you going to do with the Smart Glass? Hold a Xbox controller AND a tablet?! That seems pretty impractical.</p>
<p>So, it won&#8217;t be used as the same way as WiiPad and as much as Microsoft tried to show how it could work in demos, only a second person would be able to use the tablet because I doubt that you will be able to play the entire game just with the touchscreen.</p>
<p>interesting</p>
<p>Schmidt would make the most awkward talk show host on TV.</p>
<p>Remember last year when the Google exec shifts occurred and Eric Schmidt was interested in being a talk show host? This hour is proof positive that Schmidt should leave talk shows to pros like Stephen Colbert. Schmidt is frequently awkward and has little ability to improvise, instead going completely off his notes. Good thing Colbert carried the interview. Then again, maybe Schmidt is inspired by &#8220;Between Two Ferns&#8221;.</p>
<p>Did he actually say that? I have no problems with the company&#8217;s products but Eric Schmidt comes off as the driest, most awkward public speaker I can imagine.</p>
<p>You think thats bad he was so awkward at the iPhone presentation with his &#8220;applegoo&#8221; thing, it was painful to watch!</p>
<p>analytical proclivity and social fluidity are often diametrically opposed elements.</p>
<p>Eric? Is that you?</p>
<p>So he owns and Android tablet that doesn&#8217;t have an external volume rocker? WTF, can anyone identify this tragedy of a tablet? Also, how could he not know what Google Play is, if you have to go in there to download apps&#8230;..</p>
<p>The weirdest part was when Schmidt said the external volume controls would cost &#8216;extra&#8217;!!! Are you serious! It&#8217;s like 5 cents worth of plastic! I mean, dual cameras are extra, NFC is extra, wireless charging is extra, but volume controls? Has that not been a standard feature with every mobile device for the past 20 years?</p>
<p>obvious joke is obvious.</p>
<p>And his rambling about selling physical books at 8:50ish&#8230; I really don&#8217;t get Schmidt&#8217;s sense of humor</p>
<p>Well&#8230; a KINDLE FIRE&#8230; Oups!</p>
<p>&#8220;google&#8221; tablet ;)</p>
<p>Well, the Fire is an Android tablet. Even if it <i>isn&#8217;t</i> a proper Android tablet.</p>
<p>Founder?  Do you mean chairman?  Was Mr. Schmidt a founder at Google?</p>
<p>Schmidt: Your book is on Google Play<br />
Colbert: What does that mean?</p>
<p>And the &#8220;tablet&#8221; he was reffering to owning was a Kinde fire.</p>
<p>Lol. The awkward facts about android and google play that Schmidt says. Colbert is great so far though</p>
<p>Brrr, i really have a distinct distane for Eric Schmidt.. <br />
He&#8217;s like the devil xD</p>
<p>Incredibly fascinating discussion. His insight and logic show that there is something behind his work and it&#8217;s worth thinking about.</p>
<p>He he, Colbert said to Schmidt that he had a KINDLE FIRE, but Schmidt didnt get it. He he&#8230;.</p>
<p>I like Schmidt but he&#8217;s a terrible interviewer. He actually has charisma and yet you see none of that here.</p>
<p>Colbert is just Colbert to me. He&#8217;s not quite Stewart and that&#8217;s about that. I&#8217;d like to see more Stewart.</p>
<p>Stewart is a better interview (in character), but Colbert is funnier.</p>
<p>And Schmidt comes off soooo terrible in this. He&#8217;s clearly better at other things.</p>
<p>There is a lot of beautiful women at google. :D</p>
<p>plus size but very cute :)</p>
<p>Yeah, and I bet all of them are using Google+ by now.</p>
<p>i&#8217;ve never understood the appeal of jon stewart &amp; stephen colbert.  obviously i&#8217;m missing something.  are they meant to be funny?</p>
<p>Sacrilege!</p>
<p>liberal circle jerk.</p>
<p>I say this as a liberal.</p>
<p>people find comfort in consuming content that affirms them.</p>
<p>i like both stewart and colbert. and they are amusing.</p>
<p>also, poking fun at conservatives sometimes serves as a servicable proxy to actually engaging in what is becoming party warfare.</p>
<p>sorry but i have NO IDEA what you&#8217;re on about&#8230;<br />
(i&#8217;m not from the US btw)</p>
<p>Ah. Fair enough.</p>
<p>There are two major parties in the US. Democratic Party and Republican Party. The two would generally be classified as Liberal and Conservative, respectively.</p>
<p>Colbert and Stewart both have shows that are essentially forums on liberal agenda. they also poke fun at conservative dogma and generate light entertainment in that regard.</p>
<p>So guys like Colbert and Stewart are popular because they affirm a political view. this affirmation is something people find comforting &#8211; so they regularly watch the show.</p>
<p>on a serious note, the Republicans (the conservative party) are seriously on the wrong side of a good number of issues: Gun control (, climate change, ecological preservation, clean energy, abortion, healthcare, race relations and immigration, and taxes&#8230; just to name a few.</p>
<p>The nature of our government, coupled with the sheer size of the Republican Party, means the country is forced to endure asinine political policy for the sake of accurate representation of the populace.</p>
<p>Humor is our only recourse in that instance.</p>
<p>Being a liberal, I still find it a bit grimace inducing reading those last two paragraphs. You just impressed your own viewpoints on an outsider as if it were factual that republicans are wrong. Remember that what we essentially stand for are our viewpoints. Most issues can be viewed from multiple angles. Republicans are looking at it from another angle. That being said, I do agree with your viewpoints.</p>
<p>Nothing that I post should ever be taken as anything other than my opinion. But let&#8217;s itemize.</p>
<p>-gun control:. Recent events speak for themselves. Other countries make gun control work. our gun control measures are weakened by compromise where applicable or are otherwise absent. The Gun Lobby heavily funds the right.</p>
<p>-healthcare: safe to say a critical bulk of the conservative movement is opposed to universal healthcare on principle and consider mandated healthcare unconstitutional. Yet many other countries make it work.</p>
<p>-ecological preservation: Romney in one of his critical campaign speeches snickered and derided Obama&#8217;s notion of &#8220;saving the oceans.&#8221; One of his actual policy points was the decommission of the EPA.</p>
<p>-clean energy: Again, according to Romney &#8211; the standard bearer for this ending election cycle &#8211; you can&#8217;t strap a wind turbine to a car, ergo clean energy efforts are a pipe dream.</p>
<p>-race relations and immigration: the Dream Act? Self-deportation? Romney&#8217;s post election comments about &#8220;gifts&#8221; to blacks, Hispanics, and women that demanded reciprocation in the form of votes? the $3 billion dollar corporate welfare project known as the Wall &#8211; designed to keep immigrants from coming across the border (apparently if you&#8217;re from Mexico or Central America fences are among your natural weaknesses)?</p>
<p>-opposition to stem cell research. opposition to evolution being taught in schools. asymmetrical support of war on drugs. blatant anti-intellectualism. Anti-birth control and abortion but ALSO anti-welfare (so don&#8217;t get rid of unwanted births but you&#8217;re on your own with that unwanted bastard once you have him). Ironic considering Red States are essentially welfare states subsidized by Blue.</p>
<p>taxes: governments NEED to spend during downturns. Raise revenue? NEVER. despite very low tax rates when compared to other countries.</p>
<p>There are actually more positions &#8211; but my train is heading underground.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to attempt to be even-handed. I agree with you in that regard. But to state that these positions are anything less than unreasonable given the current climate is just an attempt to placate the irrational. And that&#8217;s just foolish.</p>
<p>ah ok got it.  thanks!</p>
<p>I seem to enjoy it because it makes light of serious situations where people have clearly done dumb things, regardless of party.</p>
<p>It just happens that the Republican Party makes themselves easy targets right now.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m more right wing than probably anyone else that posts on The Verge.</p>
<p>I fall in the conservative spectrum and enjoy both. I wouldn&#8217;t call it a liberal circle jerk.</p>
<p>They are very good at cutting through bullshit and hypocrisy through humor..</p>
<p>Watch one episode of The Daily Show. Their ability to catch people in their lies and dig up video clips from god knows where to do it is nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p>The whole thing was really funny. What&#8217;s to gripe about it? It was interestingly enough to draw a few laugh gags. At least, that&#8217;s how I felt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m far more likely to trust what Stephen Colbert says than what Katie Couric or Brian Williams says.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty sad statistic about today&#8217;s youth that they&#8217;d trust an unfunny hack over a journalist.</p>
<p>I think it says more about the sad state of TV journalism.</p>
<p>Brian Williams is a really good journalist, actually.</p>

Eric: Google maps are phenomenal, just ask an apple user!<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/KznW9.gif" /></p>
<p>I actually died laughing at that line for some reason.</p>
<p>Clearly Schmidt has never used Google Maps since the iOS app that they took forever to release is actually pretty terrible.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/n2CA4.gif" /></p>
<p>Oh, screw Colbert. Colbert&#8217;s schtick is basically that he pretends to be a Republican and then acts like a dick. But &#8211; who couldn&#8217;t you do that to? I could pretend to be a Democrat &#8211; or a Communist, or a monarchist, or a Presbyterian, or a Jew, or a Scotsman, or a bicyclist &#8211; and act like a dick, and that would prove&#8230; what, exactly?</p>
<p>Not funny. Not insightful, Not satirical. Screw that guy.</p>
<p>Oh, and P.S. &#8211; if you get your news and/or political commentary from the Comedy channel, you&#8217;re a retard.</p>
<p>I watch comedy central for comedy.</p>
<p>Satirizing pundits in general is not satire?<br />
He&#8217;s not pretending to be a republican, he&#8217;s pretending to be a pundit, and pointing out that they can speak out of their nether regions with no evidence.  This is meant to show that we should not take anything pundits say seriously.</p>
<p>They are highlighting the absurdity of politics through fake news and mocking punditry.  Frequently they do this by putting subjects back into context/perspective, something lost on news show screaming at each other or fearmongering.  No, you could not do this.</p>
<p>They have both said they skewer both sides but there is far more material coming from Republicans.</p>
<p>Oh and p.s. it&#8217;s Comedy Central, not the Comedy channel.  Before you insult others for being stupid, don&#8217;t be stupid.</p>
<p>This man is a genius!</p>
<p>google play is the WORST name for an online store.</p>
<p>I found it terrible at first, but it&#8217;s kinda growing on me</p>
<p>Unfortunately, true.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an experiment:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Find someone who knows nothing about the Google ecosystem.</li>
	<li>Start them on the Google homepage</li>
	<li>Tell them to find Google&#8217;s &#8220;store&#8221; that sells music/books/apps</li>
	<li>Wish them luck</li>
</ol>
<p>And then time the result.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see the split-A/B testing results that Google performed on the &#8220;Play&#8221; name.</p>
<p>Eric: &#8220;It&#8217;s like a step function.&#8221;</p>
<p>colbert: O_O</p>
<p>I miss Professor Impossible with Colbert&#8217;s voice. Glad he finally spoke about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google maps is great ask an apple user&#8221; LOL hahah so funny</p>
<p>Wow. This interview is a keeper. It&#8217;s one for the archives. The last question / answer really was brilliant to watch.</p>
<p>Schmidt and Colbert interviewing each other? It&#8217;s like a contest to see who the bigger blowhard is.</p>
<p><strong>Schmidt:</strong>  Your book is on Google Play.<br />
<strong>Colbert:</strong>  What does that mean?</p>
<p>(Spontaneous laughter from Google employees)</p>
<p>These guys are a modern day comedy duo.  Awesome!</p>
<p>&#8220;Google Maps are phenomenal. Ask an iPhone user.&#8221; -Eric Schmidt.</p>
<p>mind F**K</p>
<p>Schmidt always seems so condescending during these talks. I&#8217;m glad Colbert was able to lift the awkwardness.</p>
<p>Despite Eric&#8217;s many awkward moments that was a great interview. It really is always interesting to see Steven Colbert out of character. He had some really fantastic stories that were refreshing to here told from his genuine persona.</p>
<p>And there I was thinking the NEW gorilla glass would be inferior to the old.</p>
<p>Honestly I feel that GG2 was inferior.</p>
<p>Me, too. My HOX scratches way easier than my Captivate.</p>
<p>Same here. GG2 shows way more scratches than GG.</p>
<p>True, my GG device has not a single scratch and my Lumia 920 already has 2 massive and 2 small once</p>
<p>Agreed, used my first GG devices very roughly, worked amazing. 2nd week of extreme care of my 920 and somehow manage to get a big scratch in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>Should&#8217;ve invested in a screen protector.</p>
<p>AGREECEPTION!!</p>
<p>I can confirm this. Shoulda went with the screen protector&#8230; SMH</p>
<p>I had to get one for my 8X before the small ones got too big.</p>
<p>My HTC One X scratches way more easily than my Motorola Atrix 2.</p>
<p>Both of our HOXs have scratches.  Managed to crack the glass after a fall of less than 6  inches &#8211; onto tile, which is one of the worst surfaces for cracks, but still 6 f&#8217;ning inches.  In a way I&#8217;m lucky in that&#8217;s it&#8217;s just a small crack on the side of the border and doesn&#8217;t extend to the screen.  Since I was informer it was going to be the bones of 300 euro to fix I&#8217;ve learned to ignore it.</p>
<p>Must learn to proof read.</p>

<p>Thank You.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite happy with the scratch resistance of the current generation, what seems lacking a bit is shock/shatter resistance.</p>
<p>True. But Glass is Glass. Ive owned smartphones for years and still havent cracked any of my screens. But the scratch resistance is very much welcome.</p>
<p>They can easily layer it and make it glair.</p>
<p>They are probably saving that &#8220;ultra plus shatter resistance technology&#8221; that will be &#8220;ten times more better&#8221; for the revolutionary Gorilla Glass 4. :)</p>
<p>I hope there will come one day when I drop my tablet face-down on the footpath and it&#8217;s the concrete that cracks, not the screen &#8230; ;-)</p>
<p>Save the Gorillas&#8230; Stop making glass out of them.. ;)</p>
<p>Chimp Glass!  Now made with fewer primates!</p>
<p>I want some spider-monkey glass</p>
<p>Chip, I&#8217;m gonna come at you like a spider monkey!</p>
<p>Spider glass? Refined from real webs?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that require more primates since chimps are smaller than gorillas?</p>
<p>Nope, this process is more efficient because it uses every part of the chimp.</p>
<p>I see your jimmies have been rustled</p>
<p><img src="http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/4940/rustledjimmies4bronwinn.png" /></p>
<p>You just won the Internet</p>
<p>Its okay.. the glass is made out of gorilla poop. No animals are harmed.</p>
<p>Gorilla glass = glass for gorillas or careless humans.</p>
<p>Better scratch resistance is what was said about the 2nd generation.  A statement I found false by my own personal experience.</p>
<p>300% more resistant than 2nd gen, leading to 40% less visible scratches. It means most of the scratch resistency happens in the invisible spectrum.</p>
<p>Well that sounds like a well-made study, what with your single data point and lack of blindedness.</p>
<p>What I heard was that since the 2nd gen was more scratch resistant they&#8217;d just make it thinner so you&#8217;d get the same scratch resistance as gen 1 but it&#8217;d be thinner. Personally I&#8217;d prefer fewer scratches than a 0.1mm thinner phone.</p>
<p>Ugliest photoshoped gorilla ever.</p>
<p>Yeah I can&#8217;t get over the weird perspective they have going on.  The head is turned sideways but you can see his face.</p>
<p>I can tell its shopped because of the pixels.</p>
<p>All I could think is how well groomed that gorilla is. Then I began to imagine the person responsible for grooming gorillas and what a weird scary job that must be. Then I thought wait a minute, maybe that&#8217;s not a real photo&#8230;</p>
<p>What happens to Corning when flexible displays make way?</p>
<p>They make some flexible strong glass.</p>
<p>Make butterfly glass?</p>
<p>If a flexible display flaps its wings in Brazil&#8230;.</p>
<p>It cracks a screen in Australy&#8230;</p>
<p>Still needs to be scratch proof</p>
<p>I think this is how we all our displays to behave.</p>

<p>Wait wait wait wait&#8230;so you&#8217;re telling me that the new version will be better than the old version?!</p>

<blockquote> Corning has announced that it will showing off Gorilla Glass 3 at CES next week</blockquote>
<p>typo: it will be showing</p>
<p>thanks!</p>
<p>And still break when you drop it 2 feet onto carpet.</p>
<p>Hey. They said scratch-resistant, not shock-resistant :P</p>
<p>All gorilla glass is just a brand name. Gorilla glass is made out of the same stuff that non-gorilla glass is made of.</p>
<p> This new glass will not save your phone any better from a fall or a bad scratch than the other stuff.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not true at all, glass is a incredibly complex field.</p>
<p>You can inject different substances into glass, do a slow cool or a fast cool, you can temper it with different degrees, do different layering techniques&#8230;</p>
<p>Saying that Corning is doing nothing to advance glass is the understatement of the decade.</p>
<p>First of all I never said that GG was doing nothing to advance glass, you&#8217;re putting words in my mouth. I said it was a brand name. Like Beats by Dre. Their headphones are okay, but not worth the hype they receive.</p>
<p>My main point is if you look at some of the phones that aren&#8217;t branded with GG, they hold up fine to everyday use just like GG.</p>
<p>Aluminosilicate glass can be made with varying degrees of hardness. Harder glass is resistant to scratch, softer is resistant to shatter. So if you drop your phone and it doesn&#8217;t shatter, that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s of lower quality, just like if you see one of the many marketing moves by GG to show that it&#8217;s stuff is extremely resistant to scratch doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s higher quality.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just sick and tired of people with the mentality of &#8220;No GG? Deal breaker&#8221; when they don&#8217;t even have a clue what it is. They think it&#8217;s some secret sauce stuff constructed by Corning in Area 51. It does not defy physics any more than the competitors, and that&#8217;s obvious from the sheer amount of broken Nexus and iPhones to back that up (esp. from those that swear they never dropped their Nexus phones and yet have broken backs).</p>
<p><img src="http://www.wearysloth.com/Gallery/ActorsM/11094-20438.gif" /></p>
<p>Maybe I was just lucky&#8230;but it seemed like 2009-2010 devices were more scratch resistant than what is on the market today.  My iPhone 3GS and iPad 1 had flawless screens after a year of usage of each.  iPhone 4 has a few hairline scratches, and my iPad 2 and 3 were both have a nasty scratch.  A coworker who said he thought the same comparing his original DROID to his Galaxy Nexus.  Not much data to draw a conclusion on, though.</p>
<p>My gnex was easily scratched.</p>
<p>Ok, so it isn&#8217;t just my coworker.  Did you have an older 2009-2010 era phone that you think didn&#8217;t scratch as easily?  I&#8217;m curious because my theory is that the quality of &#8220;corning gorilla glass&#8221; has actually gone down.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget though: the Galaxy Nexus used &#8220;fortified glass&#8221; not Gorilla Glass.</p>
<p>I may be mistaken but I thought the GNex did not use Gorilla Glass.</p>
<p>It could be the differences between the first and second generations of Gorilla Glass and perceived strength / scratch resistance have something to do with phones consistently getting thinner and lighter. Just a thought.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t really had any complaints about my phones or tablets that have used it.</p>
<p>I had an Evo 4g which was near bulletproof and un-scratchable.  My current GNote 2 doesn&#8217;t seem to be scratch prone like the GNex was.  I wish the nexus 4 was avilable on Verizon.</p>
<p>My GNex fell in the side of my brother&#8217;s car and was a complete write off :( <br />
only afterwards did i find out it wasn&#8217;t Gorilla glass, but some type of fortified glass</p>
<p>Gorilla Glass is fortified glass. Corning isn&#8217;t the only company working on this stuff.</p>
<p>mine too&#8230; SGS never scratched, gnex scratched within a month lol.</p>
<p>My galaxy nexus is very scratched too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not Gorilla Glass; going from my Nexus One did seem a bit more scratch proof than the current &#8216;fortified glass&#8217; in use on my Gnex.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it was a coincidence we have Gorilla glass in the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>ill wait for GG4.</p>
<p>GG6 and gg9 are the ones I&#8217;m excited for.</p>
<p>Just for the logos.</p>
<p>Perhaps they&#8217;ll have an even creepier looking CG gorilla for that version.</p>
<p>Does it have instagram?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more looking forward to the eventual commercialization of flexible screens. Impact resistance is not glass&#8217; forte&#8230;</p>
<p>(That said, this coming from a guy who&#8217;s getting a glass-backed Nexus 4.) <strong>sigh</strong></p>
<p>Is there any third party that verifies these claims? Sorry user anecdotes don&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>This times a thousand.</p>
<p>The only reason people hype GG so much is because they&#8217;ve been told it is stronger. I guarantee under normal, everyday usage, you would not notice the difference between this and any other aluminosilicate glass.</p>
<p>And what about outside of everyday usage, like when you drop the phone or rub sand into the screen? Guess what? Gorilla Glass is also prone to scratches and shattering. Perhaps less so than other companies aluminosilicate glass, but that should be verified by a third party. Unfortunately no one really cares enough to do that because there&#8217;s no other company around that ships the volume that GG does. All their success is based on an illusion of higher quality. It reminds me of this scene from Mad Men: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LUlO5-MKNg" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LUlO5-MKNg</a></p>
<p>Is there other Aluminosilicate glass? I was under the impression Corning supplied pretty much the entire industry with it(even in cases where the Corning name or Gorilla Glass brand isn&#8217;t stated)</p>
<p>relevant Wired article: <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/ff-corning-gorilla-glass/" target="_blank">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/ff-corning-gorilla-glass/</a></p>

<p>Lol!!!</p>
<p>LOL!</p>
<p>Hahahahaha awesome</p>
<p>Will it blend?</p>
<p>It  already seems pretty strong, I get more worried about scratching other parts of my phone now. I guess I&#8217;m just weird.</p>
<p>Just make it more shatter resistant, and I&#8217;ll be happy.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good point, I&#8217;ve seen a lot more smashed screens than I&#8217;ve seen scratched&#8230; maybe a liquid/gel filling&#8230; copyright! :-D</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3c8il_Q6SU&feature=share&list=UUhYU73igK5wQhWAXPh3X8PA">breaking it?</a></p>
<p>meh, I just use cheap shit screen protectors, they seem to do the job. (like the stuff that costs $2)</p>
<p>Great to see advances in this area of material science, I&#8217;d like to imagine that phones in the not-too-distant future will be close to indestructible(as in, for regular life usage), I dropped my iPhone(From about 5 feet onto hardwood floor, no case)for the first time in its life yesterday and while it survived without any scratches or cracks, I feel like I got lucky. It&#8217;d be great to not even have to worry about that at all really.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s the other way, getting worse. The old Nokia and Moto phones could REALLY take a beating.</p>
<p>And I will not hear excuses like &#8216;but they weren&#8217;t half glass screens&#8217;. :-)</p>
<p>True, my first two cell phones were pretty tanks, but that was literally the only thing they had going for them. Phones used to suck so hard. Besides, it&#8217;s not just for phones, hopefully materials will improve enough to make tablets much stronger as well.</p>
<p>Am I missing something? What ever happened to Lotus glass?</p>
<p>And they forgot to say it will be 2 times less resistant than gg1. Liars.</p>
<p>My nexus 4 got a shallow scratch within 2 weeks.. Whilst I was waiting for screen protector shipping. <br />
On the other hand, been using first moto droid for 3 years w/o protector but no scratch.</p>
<p>For those saying they want it more shatter proof not more scratch resistant this should also help with that. Glass strength is decreased when scratched (even when invisible to the naked eye). A crack will tend to form more easily from a scratch as it becomes a weak point in the glass.</p>
<p>gorilla glass? who choosed this name????<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s also Gorilla Glue. It&#8217;s meant to convey that it is strong.</p>
<p>I care far less about scratch resistance than I do shatter/crack resistance.. I have used a product that they apply at the mall kiosk called Invisible Shield for my last 4 phones. My Nokia Lumia&#8217;s screen shattered after falling from the dash of the car (being used as a GPS with no mount) to the floorboard. My old 3GS fell 15 feet off the deck onto gravel and did not shatter. GG2 is junk, as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>How does one quantify scratch resistance?  Is there a conventional metric for it, or is it expressed simply by comparative experimentation?</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that can store information for more than just a couple of million years.</p>
<p>We should test it. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard. Just store data on it and wait a million years.</p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s not as if we have never recovered things that have been preserved for millions of years. Amber preserves insects and small reptiles for hundreds of millions of years. So we know what it takes to last that long, all we must do is exploit the technology.</p>
<p>So we should dip our drives in amber?</p>
<p>Are you saying that you don&#8217;t? Peh, amateur.</p>
<p>way to archive important historical and cultural data?</p>
<p>indeed I&#8217;m compiling my all-time top fav 40MB of GIFs right now.</p>
<p>I bet thing can&#8217;t hold General  Zod and his cohorts.</p>
<p>Would it really be any different if they said it could last a few <strong>hundred</strong> million years? At a certain point, I feel it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>
<p>You mean this thing lasts SEVENTY <strong>TRAZILLION </strong>YEARS?!?!?!</p>
<p>Right out of the movie 2001 Space Odyssey.</p>
<p>Be right back; backing up data to my window.</p>
<p>Your windows are made up of quartz?</p>
<p>You guessed right. I&#8217;m a billionaire.</p>
<p>I LOVE HOW THEY CAN JUST THROW NUMBERS AROUND, LIKE ANYONE WILL BE AROUND IN A COUPLE MILLION YEARS TO SEE IF THAT MP3 IS STILL ON THE GLASS.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll all be shouted to death by then, apparently&#8230;</p>
<p>If you know the rate of decay, can&#8217;t you simply model the outcome?</p>
<p>The way science works you can do that. Not because we, ourselves, have tested this, but because we have seen things like amber fossils last millions of years and we know how and why it was able to do that. It&#8217;s not just a blind prediction.</p>
<p>As long as it&#8217;s not Will.i.am&#8230;</p>

<p>We can now write the history on Notepad and save it there. 40MB is more than enough!</p>
<p>Wikipedia man, on a diamond etched glass with golden casing for nature proof longevity. If anything they recover future civilizations and read off of it.</p>
<p>All our spelling mistakes saved for eternity!</p>
<p>Now people will be looking at glass saying &#8220;I wonder if there is information on that&#8221;</p>
<p>So is the medium quartz or is it glass?</p>
<p>I expect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_glass" target="new">both</a>.</p>
<p>First thing that came to my mind <img src="http://www.lashorasperdidas.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/0171_2_.gif" /></p>
<p><img src="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y93/furious_dc/5067064043_b7dbf12042_z.jpg" /></p>
<p>So &#8230; basically it&#8217;s a simple CD of a different material, no? &#8230; I mean, really now.</p>
<p>Depends&#8230; this might be multi-photon absorption, but ya never know.</p>
<p>Umm&#8230; Does a simple CD survive doomsday and millions of years intact? I mean, really now.</p>
<p>Sure, the data is preserved, but what about the method of retrieving that data?  How do you preserve <i>that</i> for millions of years?</p>
<p>If we found a piece of glass like that on another planet, I&#8217;m pretty sure we could decrypt it.</p>
<p>But if you came across it on another planet, long after the civilization that created it has crumbled to ruins, how would you <strong>know</strong> it contained data to decrypt?  That&#8217;s just as big a challenge.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be easier with instructions.  We could probably laser etch some human readable instructions into some quartz glass.  Write the instructions in a number of languages, laid out to make it obvious that they are translations of each other (a Rosetta Stone of sorts), and hopefully you&#8217;ve done enough to make the instructions decodable, and thus the data readable.</p>
<p>There are lots of things you can do to mark something out as &#8220;definitely there for a purpose, so please analyse me&#8221;.  Stick it in a box labelled &#8220;The History of Mankind as it is Known to Us&#8221;.  Even if &#8216;they&#8217; can&#8217;t read it, they&#8217;ll be all, &#8220;Wow, this is obvious important, because they put it in this awesome labelled box.&#8221;</p>
<p>The goal of this sort of thing isn&#8217;t really to preserve data for millions of years. It&#8217;s technically possible, but what this could be really useful right now is reliable storage for hundreds of years. Right now the library of congress uses analog tape for long term digital storage so even at its current storage capacity it&#8217;s far superior.</p>
<p><strong>Isn&#8217;t a CD-R 700mb?</strong> <br />
Which is if <em>Windows Calculator</em> serves me right, 17.5 times the storage capacity of that clear tile?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re talking about data density: 40MB per square inch of material.</p>
<p>Ah yes. I see those words&#8230; <em>directly following the part I read.</em></p>
<p>Yes, but a CD-R will last only a few decades.</p>
<p>Really? I&#8217;ve never had a CD-R last more than a few days. This one time I scratched it before I could even reach my car. I&#8217;d say that one lasted 4 minutes flat!</p>
<p>it looks like the disk they use on <em>fringe</em>, we should could put those things in our hands too xD</p>
<p>I wonder if next step could be to texture the glass. Give it a surface with lots of angled edges to improve its surface area and you can burn in more information per square inch. I guess then the burners and readers would have to fire at multiple angles to do that. Hm.</p>

<p>Way out there Kickstarter 2020 idea:<br />
Imagine a time capsule-style data backup were an archive is etched in glass &#8211; and that same glass storing the data is the transparent panel used for a touch display to allow visual interaction with the contents. Building on Samsung&#8217;s transparent TV display technology&#8230;. <img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/readers/2011/09/02/samsungmstv8_1.jpg" /> Swipe through a photo album or playback home moves, etc&#8230;.</p>
<p>Are you predicting that in 2020 Samsung will be such a failure that they will require Kickstarter funds to create new products?</p>

<p>On a cosmic scale, millions of years isn&#8217;t very long.</p>
<p>Correct but on the scale of lifespans and long term space flights its seems like a tremendous amount of time</p>
<p>Someone should sue Microsoft for false advertising.</p>
<p>we should check all the quartz &#8230;</p>

<blockquote>Hitachi&#8217;s solution would be able to survive nearly any doomsday scenario you can imagine</blockquote>
<p>Someone correct me if I am making wrong assumptions, but it looks like it wouldn&#8217;t be able to survive the &#8220;doomsday scenarios&#8221; of being dropped, crushed or snapped in half.</p>
<p>And probably not a commet collission (at point of  impact), black hole consumption, super volcano or our sun going supernovea.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit the first thing I thought of was the ISO Linear Chip&#8230;.  <img src="http://section47.byethost13.com/CCS/DCLN/technologies/isolinear.jpg" /></p>
<p>It would just get lost. And if even found it would just be treated as trash, or some piece of something that broke off.</p>
<p>what case is that?</p>
<p>It looks just like the &ldquo;Acme Made&rdquo; one I just got from Best Buy for my Chromebook.</p>
<p>No shots of the bottom?</p>
<p>9th picture from the end shows the bottom</p>
<p>It has black keys on a silvery chassis, how original.  Also the squared off shape reminds me of the ThinkPads.</p>
<p>This thing is fucking sexy. People can say any piece of hardware rips off anything else, I don&rsquo;t see life like that. In reality, a reality where government laws are just opinions enforced by guns, real progress comes from copying ideas and improving them at the margin.</p>
<p>This design takes what&rsquo;s already good about so many other products, and spins it in a gorgeous way. If it was 20-30% thinner, it would be downright irresistible.</p>

<p>Some very interesting things in that document.</p>
<p>Agreed. Quite the sneak peek at the future.</p>
<p>A sneak peek at the future but from the past, quite how this vision has panned out we don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>A lot of it has already panned out, SmartGlass and Metro dashboard etc.</p>
<p>And still no planned revision to the current, crappy 360 Dashboard. MS still won&#8217;t give me the option to revert to the older settings, I never thought I&#8217;d miss Blades but daym if the new one isn&#8217;t a nightmare to actually navigate games.</p>
<p>Slide 6 reads:<br />
New Dashboard<br />
-­‐ NextGen interface (NUI enabled)</p>
<p>The new dashboard is even more Metro, and they&#8217;re not adding the option of using an older UI. We don&#8217;t have Netflix in Australia, I don&#8217;t care for Bing, and I don&#8217;t have a Kinect. I use my Xbox to just play games and the last Dashboard is a mess to actually navigate your library and XBLA titles.</p>
<p>The Xbox is no longer a gaming console, it&#8217;s an entertainment console, that should be pretty evident even without this document</p>
<p>It was little more than a games console when many of us bought ours though. They&#8217;ve changed the focus of the console on us, after we&#8217;ve already dropped £300 on it. I personally don&#8217;t mind the sort of direction it&#8217;s going but I think most have a good reason to complain.</p>
<p>Changed the focus but has done nothing to hinder gaming what-so-ever. So the box you bought for gaming still games just as well (better) as when you bought it.</p>
<p>&#8220;nothing to hinder gaming what-so-ever&#8221;</p>
<p>Except for, you know, the terrible interface.</p>
<p>With Metro being a central theme across all of Microsoft&#8217;s products you&#8217;ll have no choice but to get used to it or go Mac.</p>
<p>More amazing is that a failed and unpopular product is responsible for Microsoft&#8217;s current and future flagship design principle. Yes, I&#8217;m talking about the Zune.</p>
<p>metro isn&#8217;t the problem, so much as organization. no one minds the square look. things are getting buried with MSs preference for ads.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind any of the stuff complained about above but what I do mind is how seemingly unoptimized the new UI is. All the apps seem to load super slow.</p>
<p>When you say &#8220;no one minds&#8221; I think you should look at the comment I responded to. I think &#8220;some&#8221; people have a problem with the interface.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m partial to it but I&#8217;m not so sure of its use outside of a smartphone or the Xbox dashboard.</p>
<p>While it certainly brings everything together I&#8217;m not so sure that&#8217;s a good idea. At least not the way Microsoft is going about it. Kinda feels like we&#8217;re being dragged into Metro kicking and screaming.</p>
<p>User error. If you only want to play games, set your console to autolaunch disc in drive.</p>
<p>here are the steps<br />
1. RTFM<br />
2. Configure as desired<br />
3. Load disc <br />
4. Enjoy game</p>
<p>Because a gamer would never want to play XBLA games, demos or Indie games. Nice troll.</p>
<p>I knew from day one that the 360 could stream media from a Media Center PC.  In 2006, I had 2 upgrades: 1. I bought a Media Center (XP) PC.  2. I bought an Xbox 360.  I was DVR&#8217;ing shows on the PC, then streaming to the Xbox 360 to playback on my TV in 2006.<br />
It was &#8216;little more than a game console&#8217; because people didn&#8217;t understand those things back then, even though all the options were there.  The all-in-one entertainment box isn&#8217;t a recent idea&#8230; MS and Sony been planning and rolling out these concepts for over half a decade now.</p>
<p>I think if you bought an original 360 you did pretty well out of it all things considered, I think adding an entertainment layer hasn&#8217;t really hindered gaming on it. You stick the disc in it goes straight to game, what&#8217;s the issue.</p>
<p>My original xbox 360 RROD&#8217;ed and so did it&#8217;s replacement. I will never buy another MS console again.</p>
<p>People are STILL bitching about that?</p>
<p>Let it go. It&#8217;s in the past. I&#8217;ve had 4 replacements, but I&#8217;m still glad I&#8217;ve gotten an 360 + Xbox Live.</p>
<p>says the fool who bought 4 replacement console..</p>
<p>warranty? who&#8217;s the fool here</p>
<p>No, its pretty valid really.  I myself refuse to buy any Sony products because every Sony product I&#8217;ve ever owned turned to complete shit with a short lifespan&#8230; from CD players to gaming consoles to laptops from the last 20 years.  Am I missing out on some possible new and better products that isn&#8217;t junk?  Probably&#8230;. but Sony crapped on me enough that I don&#8217;t care and in reality, they are missing out on my dollars.</p>
<p>Right and they still gave it a shitty touchscreen interface with tiles that are counter-intuitive and ridiculous to navigate.</p>
<p>Disagreed to the max.  The Xbox Dashboard is wonderful.  I love it more than the previous ones and wouldn&#8217;t go back to the older styles for any reason.  If you don&#8217;t like it, fine.  But your opinion of it not being as good as an older version doesn&#8217;t make it crap or a bad design.  It&#8217;s actually very good and smartly designed.  With Kinect, it&#8217;s even better.  There is room for a few small improvements, but overall it&#8217;s well done.</p>
<p>Cool info.  I wonder if 6x the power of the current Xbox 360 is sufficient enough to withstand a &#8220;10 year life cycle&#8221;.  My thinking is that you&#8217;d have to go higher in power to make that possible.  But perhaps they can design the &#8220;720&#8221; to mimick what Nintendo did with the N64: offer a graphics expansion/improvement several years down the road.  You&#8217;d need to eventually.  The CPU capability would be hard to tap out in the first few years, especially with 6-8 cores available.  I&#8217;m super excited for what&#8217;s next for Xbox.  We need new consoles.  Current generation games are showing their age all over the place.  The 360 is still able to stay relevant with Kinect and multimedia offerings via Live and apps, but they would be foolish to think they can skate by another 2 years on the current hardware.  It&#8217;s time for the next big thing.</p>
<p>The new dashboard, now with more ads than ever!</p>
<p>Oh please&#8230; I wish all the other ads on the internet were as discreet as those on the Xbox dashboard. The only time I ever interact with those things is when they actually interest me.</p>
<p>And I hope that you don&#8217;t count the tiles that talk about game releases, sales and dlc as &#8220;Ads&#8221;&#8230; Because they are right at their place in the xbox dashboard, I hated having to be all over the net to know what was going on just a few menus deeper in my Xbox interface !</p>
<p>If there is one word I would not use to describe the dashboard ads it is discrete. They vastly outnumber actual functional buttons.</p>
<p>they are discrete. If youre talking ACTUAL ads yes they are and they blend into the whole experience. stop being a baby.</p>
<p>They in no way blend into the experience, they are the experience, there are on average 4 ads for 2 actual menu buttons per page.</p>
<p>You must be using a different xbox dashboard than I&#8217;m using.  None of your posts match the experience I have.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/09/xbox2011dashupdate12343-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>5 spaces, 2 buttons (play disk &amp; games library) and 3 ads, one of which has a constantly changing image.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/09/dash-games-dashup83838.jpg" /></p>
<p>8 spaces, 2 buttons and 6 ads.</p>
<p><em>(images are cut off at the sides because we&#8217;re further down the comment thread and the comment width is limited)</em></p>
<p>Sorry but the only &#8220;ad&#8221; is the one marked Advertisement in the bottom left corner, the rest showcase content which I like seeing so no they aren&#8217;t ad&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Then you sir. Are a fool. Just because it&#8217;s advertising something that is on Xbox Live doesn&#8217;t make it not an ad. That&#8217;s like saying an advert for a TV show on TV isn&#8217;t an ad.</p>
<p>UMM this is exactly how it was before the Metro update! There was always COD tiles or other thing promoting games. The only real ad is usually on the corner right.</p>
<p>yeah, and the ads were annoying them too. But they&#8217;re even moreso now.</p>
<p>If you were watching NBC and you saw a thing promoting the Office, would you call that an ad?</p>
<p>I would call that more of a trailer, which I happen to enjoy.</p>
<p>And I get your point but relating to TV ads is a bad example. They want the 360 to be a media consumption device so they are bound to have links to content that people want. Apart from the fact that those &#8220;ads&#8221; have often alerted me to things I want now being available, including a lot of free content, those links are way less annoying than traditional internet ads. I see this no different to landing on the iTunes store front page now.</p>
<p>How hard is it really to navigate anyway?</p>
<p>I want MS to how off content they have on the marketplace&#8230; I also personally don&#8217;t find the new dashboard difficult to use at all.</p>
<p>How would people discover what is new on Xbox without the featured content?</p>
<p>Most people do not read about games online on a regular basis so please don&#8217;t say something silly like that. Not to mention there is no news source for new TV shows and movies released on Xbox.</p>
<p>Why did you reply the same point to 2 different comments on mine?</p>
<p>I replied to the other.</p>
<p>You still haven&#8217;t explained how people would discover new content on Xbox without the featured content on the dashboard. They would have to go sifting through lists of nested menus, which most people won&#8217;t bother with.  Lucky you do not run Xbox Live, they wouldn&#8217;t be doing very well financially.  Xbox Live is now over $1 billion a year business because of this content.</p>
<blockquote>Xbox Live is now over $1 billion a year business because of this content.</blockquote>
<p>Good for them. Doesn&#8217;t make it good for the user.</p>
<p>And yes I did say how in my other reply to you. Like iTunes or any number of other stores just have the &#8216;featured&#8217; ads etc&#8230; when you&#8217;re actually in the store area.</p>
<p>It certainly hasn&#8217;t made it any worse. The new UI is an improvement over the last. The ads are in equal quantity/quality, but the navigation is better and now consistent with MS branding across all platforms.</p>
<p>People can complain, but not everyone is hot and bothered over it. That&#8217;s  ok too. It makes little difference to me. Though I think they could make the categorize and apps more organized.</p>
<p>The Xbox is all about Content, period.  If you open the Guide on a DVR or Cable/Satellite receiver, there are content ads there.  Are you also saying that is annoying as well?  What doesn&#8217;t annoy you?  I’m not defending the commercialized media the US has become, but what other way would you prefer companies market content and material to you?  I for one do not mind, nor think the Metro UI is garbage, or believe the so-called &#8220;ads&#8221; annoying.  IN fact, if it weren&#8217;t for them, I wouldn&#8217;t have purchased game add-ons, or knew about a game demo now available.  You are simply being over critical, and hypersensitive.  If you don&#8217;t like it, stop playing on the Xbox and go use your PC.  Oh wait, Steam has ads there as well.  Oh well.  I guess you need to disconnect from the Interwebz permanently.</p>
<blockquote> If you open the Guide on a DVR or Cable/Satellite receiver, there are content ads there. Are you also saying that is annoying as well? </blockquote>
<p>wait. Really? I&#8217;m from the UK and our premium TV services (Sky for example) certainly don&#8217;t have ads plastered all over the UI. yes I would find that very annoying.</p>
<p>If the user is buying more and more content on Xbox Live, it&#8217;s a safe assumption that most users are happy.  If consumers are giving you more money for your on-demand content then you would be an idiot to do something that would hinder that in any way. Taking the featured content off of the Xbox dashboard would result in fewer downloads and sales. I&#8217;m sorry that it bothers you, but I&#8217;m sure if it was up to you there would be no commercials on TV, no previews or commercials before movies, no ads on the radio, no banner ads on websites, etc. That&#8217;s not the real world, get over it, featuring content sells more content. It&#8217;s not going away; stop crying.   Have your games boot directly to the disc if it bothers you that much.</p>
<blockquote>I’m sorry that it bothers you, but I’m sure if it was up to you there would be no commercials on TV, no previews or commercials before movies, no ads on the radio, no banner ads on websites, etc.</blockquote>
<p>Oh no i love movie ads. I always make sure I see them, no joke.</p>
<p>Well in America it&#8217;s not unheard of for people to pay for a movie ticket just to see a trailer for another movie before that film. Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve done that myself, but it happens.  People rely on these featured pieces of content to know what is coming out soon. You can bitch all you want about it, but it is an essential part of the business.</p>
<p>And if you have a crazy hang up about featured content on Xbox, like I said set your console to boot the game disc automatically and never go to the dashboard. The guide button gets you around the console without having to even use the Dashboard.</p>
<blockquote>And if you have a crazy hang up about featured content on Xbox, like I said set your console to boot the game disc automatically and never go to the dashboard. The guide button gets you around the console without having to even use the Dashboard.</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t just use my Xbox for games.</p>
<p>wow. just wow.</p>
<p>They are sort of ads because they are paid for by publishers or put there because their MS games. I think &#8220;ads&#8221; was a pore choice of wording, but its the same idea. I think what @wayaways means is theres more stuff they want him to buy and not enough of what he already owns.</p>
<p>It is 100% an ad. It is advertising pr promoting a product or service. That is an ad.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s featured content. And it&#8217;s extremely important to most consumers. You couldn&#8217;t find new content on iTunes or Xbox without a featured section like this.</p>
<p>The MASIVE difference with iTunes is you have to go into the iTunes store to see that featured content, you are already in the shopping environment.</p>
<p>This is all over every area of the UI, that is an ad.</p>
<p>Honestly you&#8217;re bitching about nothing. I guess the whole dam internet is one big ad. And your life. It&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s ads on the market place talking about irrelevant bs trying to sell me cleaning products or diet pills. now please shutup.</p>
<p>Yes there are ads all over the internet.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t pay a fee for &#8216;internet god&#8217; every year.</p>
<p>You pay for movies, cable TV, magazines, newspapers, some websites, satellite radio, you pay taxes and tolls on the road and yet all of that also has advertising. Just because you pay for something doesn&#8217;t mean it is ad-free. In fact in most cases you pay for stuff there are still ads. Even many games have ads in them now.</p>
<p>A) 2 wrongs don&#8217;t make a right.</p>
<p>B) Those things don&#8217;t have ad-free competitors.</p>
<p>So because Nintendo and Sony are losing billions of dollars and failing at online, Microsoft should copy their business model and abandon one of their fastest growing profit centers?</p>
<p>The reality is that Sony is trying very hard to figure out how to implement Xbox Live&#8217;s business model and emulate their success.  You&#8217;ve got things backwards.</p>
<p>Please provide a source on the bit where the Playstation arm of Sony is losing money.</p>
<p>you surely don&#8217;t get internet for free. are you a thief?</p>
<p>You also pay for the internet to use Xbox live&#8230;</p>
<p>Gold*</p>
<p>Ads masquerading as UI elements is not at all good and really, you&#8217;re kind of dumb if you think otherwise.</p>
<p>Hos about if there was a Frito Lays button right next to your browser&#8217;s back buttons? Not in the web window but in the actual UI chrome.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be dumb about this, you&#8217;re just wrong.</p>
<p>If it was a really good web browser, I probably would not care to be honest. Then again I don&#8217;t walk out of the movie theater when a preview comes on or shake my fist in anger when I see a billboard on the side of the road after having paid a toll.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s, you got it wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like those examples and you know it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more like if you have to look at ads the dashboard of your car and the ads were right next to your radio controls and on the corner of your windshield.</p>
<p>Difference is the Xbox Experience is showing you things you can buy or view that would be used in the Xbox. Having a Bag of Fritos is totally unusualable in a browser since it isn&#8217;t something you can download/view.</p>
<p>The ads placed in the Xbox Live are very sneaky, but we all know they are there and often do not click on them unless we are interested.</p>
<p>If you pay to be featured, it&#8217;s an advert.</p>
<p>You guys are seriously stupid or unrealistic if you&#8217;re bitching about this. Next time you go to the supermarket and see Boxes of cans of Coke for sale, and go &#8216;oh, this is a good deal, I&#8217;ll buy heaps&#8217;, just know that the product&#8217;s placement was paid for by Coca Cola. It&#8217;s just part and parcel of owning your own store, which in this case is MS owning the Xbox Live experience</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually a good analogy&#8230; what about club stores, like Sam&#8217;s and Costco?  People PAY for the privileged to shop at those stores and are  blasted by sales pitches.  You go in there to buy a 100 pack of toilet paper or a gallon jug of mayonaise or some crap and you get some little swarthy guy bugging you about hard wood flooring, or some ex-hooker talking about DirecTV or some schlub trying to sell you At&amp;t Wireless.</p>
<p>All in all&#8230; its a priority issue.  If you hate the capitalist machine so damn much, then BAN and QUIT everything.  If you find that the overall experience and content is something you still have and HOMYGAWD you have to suffer through a couple of squares of &#8216;ads&#8217;, then get over it.  People bitch about anything man.</p>
<p>Oh, please&#8230;<br />
According to your logic, the tiles at the top of the front page of TheVerge.com are actually &#8220;ads&#8221;.  They&#8217;re not ads, they&#8217;re graphical links to content.  Same as on the Xbox dashboard.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re being totally absurd.  But if you don&#8217;t like it, get a PS3.  Good grief.</p>
<p>Apparently we&#8217;re all stupid for not thinking Chuck Norris&#8217;s face blended in SOOO perfecting in our gaming GUIs.</p>
<p>The 360&#8217;s dashboard is a joke. Sony, Steam and Nintendo don&#8217;t have ANY ads directing on their dashboards. WHY the fuck is MS doing it? Oh because they know people will put up with it even if it is bullshit.</p>
<p>I prefer the Metro dashboard visually to the XMB or Wii home screen. It&#8217;s just too plastered with ads. It&#8217;s so much more awkward to find subsections because it&#8217;s not clear what is an ad and what isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>One slight correction, Sony does have ads but it&#8217;s only when you navigate over one of the PS Store icons.</p>
<p>Otherwise, yes, there are no ads on the dashboard itself where as every section of the Xbox dashboard has some sort of ad.</p>
<p>Playing devil&#8217;s advocate maybe this is how they can keep costs down. Similar to how most everything Google does is free because they live and die by ad revenues maybe MSFT is following suit.</p>
<p>Eh, but at that point you&#8217;re previewing the game or video store, not really the same thing since it is all from Sony, not rented ad space from Toyota or Oreos.</p>
<p>Like you said it isn&#8217;t on the dashboard itself, those are store icons and when you highlight them the background image changes so that you can see a preview of the newest additions.</p>
<p>you just contradicted yourself.</p>
<p>Previewing games on the PSN store is not at all the same like an ad from Mustang masquerading as an actual UI element.</p>
<p>Try harder</p>
<p>Last I checked Sony was chasing Microsoft&#8217;s success with Xbox Live, not the other way around. Sony really isn&#8217;t the company you want to be taking business advice from. $6.5 billion loss last year. They keep this up and maybe there won&#8217;t even be a PS4.</p>
<p>Strawman argument, try again.</p>
<p>Ads should <strong>NOT </strong>be masquerading as UI elements/</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment.</p>
<p>With the disastrous interface that&#8217;s on the Vita I fear for the PS4&#8217;s UI. While I still like the XMB it&#8217;s getting a little long in the tooth.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping they have a better design team for the PS4, which I&#8217;m almost certain we&#8217;ll see if for no other reason than to sell more Blu-ray players.</p>
<p>why the vita&#8217;s UI is somewhat fluid, it&#8217;s incredibly ugly. If they can make a new interface that&#8217;s better than that&#8217;s awesome, other wise though I hope they stick with XMB. XMB isn&#8217;t that great looking now that I think about it though, and man does PSN need a redesign. Thank god there&#8217;s a search feature.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? Steam shows you ads whenever you exit a game.</p>
<p>Those aren&#8217;t in the dashboard pretending to be UI elements like on the 360.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird that you keep harping about this- I fail to see how ads in Xbox live &#8220;masquerade as UI elements&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://cache.kotaku.com/assets/images/9/2011/12/xlarge_517408ea7da49d9763a3ddae256cffa6.jpg" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s how.</p>
<p>Ads are intermingled with items that people actually want to get to. Why is there a World of Warcraft ad right next to the things actually relevant to music? The pic is in the music tab, yet here we have a ad right smack dab in the middle of the music options.</p>
<p>That is the <em>one</em> ad that you find on each pane, clearly labeled an &#8216;advertisement&#8217;. And in any case, it&#8217;s not a UI element, it&#8217;s a piece of content.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not a UI element, that ad is <strong>MASQUERADING </strong>as one though.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be with all the actual function buttons. IT should be in a  separate space or not there at all.</p>
<p>The actual function buttons? I&#8217;m assuming you mean the &#8216;My Music Apps&#8217; and &#8216;Zune Music Marketplace&#8217;, since every other tile on the page is also content and not UI. Those stand out very distinctly against the other tiles on the page by virtue of their bright green monochrome.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s clearly marked as an Advertisement, which it is, then surely you can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s an UI element because it&#8217;s clearly marked as an ad. Frankly, I&#8217;m happy with the Dashboard and the featured content, I can&#8217;t see your point of view, it just seems like you&#8217;re nitpicking for the sake of it.</p>
<p>ya because you know&#8230; pop up &#8220;ads&#8221; are better?</p>
<p>let alone the fact that MS even tells you it&#8217;s an advertisement&#8230; it&#8217;s not like they are trying to hide it.</p>
<p><strong>@BlatantNinja23<br />
</strong><br />
Concerning stream&#8217;s popup &#8220;ads&#8221;:</p>
<p>At least once you close the window you never have to deal with them again and they don&#8217;t make it harder to reach the content you actually want.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t find the 360&#8217;s content hard to find</p>
<p>Uh, yeah Steam does have &#8220;ads.&#8221;  They advertise about game specials, bundles, etc.  Those are ads based on your logic.  You are simply bitching to bitch.</p>
<p>Those aren&#8217;t in the dashboard pretending to be UI elements like on the 360.</p>
<p>Ahem. Let me, blow, your mind. Steam. Settings. Interface. Check box next to &#8216;Notify me (with Steam Instant Messages) about blah blah blah etc.&#8217;. Ads. Gone. Forever.</p>
<p>Why are you so angry?  Just get a different system.<br />
How old are you, twelve?</p>
<p>Since when has it become ok to plaster ads on to your game console screen? We let Microsoft get away with this way too easy. It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;ve signed up for an ad-supported service.</p>
<p>Since when would you consider XBL a service that isn&#8217;t supported by ads or one  that shouldn&#8217;t be supported by ads? It&#8217;s a paid service. That doesn&#8217;t mean ad free.</p>
<p>What are we paying for then? Servers are paid for by individual publishers for multiplayer games, ads pay for server costs to keep Xbox Live itself running, and downloads are covered almost entirely by the fact we&#8217;re buying the content to begin with (at full price, mind you, not taking into account that there are little or no production costs to a digital purchase). So, what are we paying for? Legitimate question. I can&#8217;t think of a single thing that we actually need to pay this cash for, beyond pure profit, which as consumers we shouldn&#8217;t willingly accept, and we definitely shouldn&#8217;t defend it. Remember the blades, from way back when? I remember about, 5-10% of the screen being taken up with any type of ad, promotional or otherwise. The rest was hidden away behind new releases and &#8216;New and Noteworthy&#8217; which was essentially what, you know, the entire dashboard is now.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t see the value in the service you subscribe and pay money to use, why are you using it?</p>
<p>The money from XBL goes  to a lot of different things. Stability is one. Content deals is one. Feature platform. Ease of use. Quality of online gaming. I assume it goes into IP for MS games and franchises they own, gathering exclusives, etc.</p>
<p>For many XBL Gold is the best gaming service. There are other options, with pros and cons, but if you don&#8217;t see the value, other platforms might be better for you.</p>
<p>None of those things are what we as consumers should have to pay for. None. Stability? I don&#8217;t pay a subscription for a stable TV connection, I pay for content. Content deals? That should be between the publisher and the distributor, and have nothing to do with the consumer. Feature platform? No, really, feature platform? I have no idea what that even means, but I&#8217;m going to assume we shouldn&#8217;t have to pay for it, sound good? Alright. Ease of use? It should be easy to use without a monthly fee, or why are they trying to attract the mass market? Quality of online gaming? Only Microsoft brand games use Microsoft servers for online. The rest is either publisher run or very rarely player sponsored. When EA shuts down NHL 05 or Need for Speed 27s online servers, the game is no longer online regardless of what platform it is running on. IP exclusives? Why do we want that? What, as a consumer, does that make for a better experience for us? That&#8217;s something that is purely marketing. &#8220;OUR CONSOLE HAS THIS AND THIS ONE DOESN&#8217;T&#8221;, we&#8217;re paying to be fanboys now?</p>
<p>As for your last statement, and first, I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t pay for anything that I don&#8217;t see value in, and nothing you said here screams &#8216;VALUE&#8217; to me, it screams weakness. It&#8217;s everything that is wrong with how we look at ourselves within society. We get to pay for the privelage of being a capitalist society, and if we want to really get the full sense of being loyal, we get to pay a bit extra. We are beyond illogical.</p>
<p>Simple solution: BUY A DIFFERENT PRODUCT.   Nobody is forcing you to buy into the Xbox ecosystem.</p>
<p>To be fair that&#8217; snot a fair argument. Jezuz can like the overall experience but wish there wree less ads.<br />
For me personally, I like the ads. I rarely click on them, but it&#8217;s interesting to see different content every now and then</p>
<p>Yet, I have the feeling you probably pay for cable or satellite&#8230;hmmm&#8230;.</p>
<p>According to your reasoning, since you pay for television services, you should not have to watch ads, right? And since you pay for the clothing you wear at the department store, they shouldn&#8217;t entice you to save an extra 20% by opening a credit account, right? And since you pay for the Internet by which your comment was made available for all to see, you shouldn&#8217;t have to see ad banners, right? Just because you are paying MS for a service doesn&#8217;t mean they cannot entice you to buy more. Don&#8217;t like it, move to China. They have a lot of rules.</p>
<p>You possess a superhuman amount of dumbfuckery. I don&#8217;t understand how you can bitch about something like this. It&#8217;s a fucking online platform that contains the VERY significant service of offering downloadable media. On Xbox Live <strong>true</strong> ads usually consist of something random like a new car or something of that nature, not new game and movie releases.</p>
<p>Name a similar service that DOESN&#8217;T do what you have a problem with. Steam does it, PSN does it, Nintendo does it on the DS and the Wii, Vita does it, Android Market does it, the iOS App Store does it, the Marketplace on WP does it, Ovi does it, and on and on and on and on and on.</p>
<p>There are like 1 small pane in each section it isn&#8217;t that serious. You better not be using any google products.</p>
<p>You mean you better not be paying google to use any of their product.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to play halo, I end up buying a big bag of Doritos instead. DAMN YOU XBOX DASHBOARD!</p>
<p>Wow, such fanboy shilling I&#8217;ve never seen except from an account like yours.</p>
<p>Clearly a Microsoft fan. That&#8217;s fine, but the new dashboard is awful. It does a great job of displaying content you can download, but an awful job of getting you to content you already own. I had a 360 that broke a few years ago and stopped using it for a while. The last dashboard I used was probably 2010. I get a new xbox and it has metro on it and it&#8217;s awful. The PS3 has an ugly, ugly UI, but I can get to my games real easily. Metro looks nice, but it&#8217;s to hard to find my games.</p>
<p>Really?  How hard is it to navigate ONE tile down, and launch a purchased game?  Or, better yet, JUST PRESS THE A BUTTON to play the disc?  Yeah, the Metro interface is a change from the blades, but in a GOOD way.  The Blades interfaces was way too cluttered.</p>
<p>also the favorites tile they are adding helps this. Everything I normally use is in quickplay anyways though.</p>
<p>Change your settings to boot directly to disk in the tray.  You&#8217;ll never see the dash.  hit the guide button to &#8220;quick launch&#8221; any arcade game stored on your hard drive.  Use xbox.com to browse and buy games and dlc.</p>
<p>There.  I fixed all your problems.  No Dash.</p>
<p>Yea but don&#8217;t Xbox users already pay for access to play online? So if you pay you shouldnt see any ads&#8230;.right? Ps3 is free and I never see an ad&#8230;.</p>
<p>we dont have damn ads.</p>
<p>Since when does paying for a service or product mean not seeing ads? Most of the things I pay for in life still include ads. And it doesn&#8217;t really bother me at all, especially if the ads are for things that I&#8217;m interested in.</p>
<p>TV, Newspaper, Magazines, Movies, Radio all include ads even though you pay for them. I pay for a Netflix subscription and not only does the disc have ads on it, but the mailer has an ad I have to look at every time I take the disc out of it&#8217;s sleeve.</p>
<p>Tell me about it. I&#8217;m just sitting here in my field, gnawing on some grass, and this wolf is just biting on my ass. Feels fine. This guy next to me, though, he&#8217;s putting up this huge stink about another wolf biting on his ass, and I&#8217;m just like, what&#8217;s the big dammed deal, man? Yeah, the teeth hurt. He sort of smells. But grass, man. I still have grass, and this field, and if the wolf really gets to be a pain, I can just kick him or run away and go eat grass over there, where I pooped last week. It&#8217;s just poop. The grass still tastes fine, around the poop, minimal poop in the grass. It&#8217;s, fine. But that guy, with the other wolf on his ass, is just like, still complaining and trying to bite this wolf back, but I&#8217;m just over here, with my grass. And my poop. So, forget about that. I rather just eat my grass. And my poop.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t completely get what you&#8217;re saying, but I agree with you on the poop.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all perspective. Some people might find being bitten in the ass enjoyable</p>
<p>It really isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>a nightmare to navigate games?</p>
<p>the first tile is play game in tray.  the &#8220;blades&#8221; are still there if you hit the guide button.  I NEVER understand these complaints anymore.  It&#8217;s way to much asking why as opposed to looking at the actual content and asking why not.  wtf&#8230;</p>
<p>They think the dash is great or they wouldn&#8217;t have released it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a leak of my own&#8230; Monday morning Ballmer&#8217;s going to be barreling around the office yelling &#8220;BING BING BING!!&#8221; at whimpering MSFT staff, looking for the poor bastard who leaked this document. Put it this way: the good news is MS is about to reduce their &#8216;Overhead&#8217; by about 50 grand. Ahem.</p>
<p>lolol</p>
<p>Good thing the document is ancient and probably not real</p>
<p>Probably it is real, over 50 pages of details is just too much work for a fanboy, even one with time on their hands.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for xbox 720 and a better name. LOL</p>
<p>The 2011 App store panned out already. The thing in these documents that hasn&#8217;t panned out for 2012 so far is the Xbox TV paid subscription and the &#8220;Xbox 361&#8221; low-cost Xbox for every room in your house.  Makes me wonder about will be announced on Monday in LA.</p>
<p>I know the &#8216;sphere thinks it&#8217;s a tablet. I think it&#8217;s this 361/Xbox Lite.</p>
<p>Simple coincidence. Most of it is obviously BS. Here&#8217;s some tipoffs as to this bneing fake.</p>
<p>1. It&#8217;s the most unprofessional looking document ever.</p>
<p>2. It says 348 bit memory bus. There is no 348 bit memory bus except in some older nVidia  gpus. The next Xbox is using AMD however, which is uses 128, 256, or 384 bit memory buses.</p>
<p>3. Microsoft has never referenced the next Xbox as Xbox 720. It&#8217;s stupid internet created name.</p>
<p>4. This Power Point presentation looks awful. Surely Microsoft could create a better looking presentation than that.</p>
<p>5. It says 3 CPUs, 2 GPUs. C&#8217;mon, a console can&#8217;t contain all that. It would literally explode from the heat and power draw.</p>
<p>6. A $299 price tag while maintaining margins? No way in hell.</p>
<p>7. Named Apple TV as a thread. Please!</p>
<p>I can go on and on. I can also tell you if the next Xbox is only 6 times more powerful than the Xbox 360, 8 years later, then Microsoft will get destroyed by Sony and the PS4.</p>
<p>AppleTV is not a threat to their gaming (right now). But they want to be the &#8220;everything&#8221; set top box and have since WebTV. AppleTV is absolutely a threat to their non-gaming interests.</p>
<p>That said, I agree the pieces I&#8217;ve seen from the document posted here and there are not very professional or accurate.</p>
<p>+1 for spelling ‘peek’ correctly.</p>
<p>I’m so tired of hearing about clandestine mountaintops.</p>
<p>But if peek were never misspelled, who would EVER talk about clandestine mountaintops?</p>
<p>Now if people would start spelling &#8220;pique&#8221; correctly, I could retire my cape and helmet.</p>

<p>haha. awesome.</p>
<p>Epic gifs win!</p>
<p>Can someone please make a gif on money being throw at the computer with that gif playing?</p>
<p>Inception super money throwing GIF please?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a lot of BS in that leak. That entire list is completely fake. If anyone believes that this, I&#8217;ve got a bridge to sell you.</p>
<p>Very interesting indeed. Especially Kinect Glasses. But, what impresses me is the $299 price while making it 6x faster. I&#8217;m really curious on how they plan to do that.</p>
<p>6x faster at $300 8 years after the xbox 360 launched at $300 (and $400) doesn&#8217;t seem too unreasonable. considering the GPU for the xbox 720 is rumored to be based off current second-tier GPUs, Another year will just bring down prices on GPUs and I think they can pull that price point off while being close to breaking even, if not making a few bucks on each unit.</p>
<p>I think people don&#8217;t realize the graphical jump from current xbox 360/ps3 games which are largely rendered at 720p (some a bit lower, some at 1080p, though often with medium-ish textures by PC standards) to games rendered at 1080p with high to max textures isn&#8217;t as big of a leap as it was from the original xbox to the xbox 360. I&#8217;m guessing the focus on graphical quality will be specifically on improving shadows, lighting, water effects, facial characteristics and realistic movements for the next generation of consoles.</p>
<p>As long as TVs stay at 1080p  for the next 2 or 3 decades, (which seems reasonable considering that standard def TVs lasted quite a while and the infrastructure in place for over-the-air broadcasts) successive consoles will likely be smaller incremental jumps in power than previous generations (IMO).</p>
<p>wow, this sounds pretty awesome..  Sony is really going to have to bring some big guns to keep me on their side of the fence&#8230;</p>
<p>I actually feel kind of sorry for Nintendo after seeing this. They have no chance.</p>
<p>Same here, they have a plan to follow and  really know what they want to do with the XBOX. The WiiU on the other hand just feels like an after thought for nintendo, they&#8217;re having a hard time describing what it is, people are confused and it just makes nintendo seem like it doesn&#8217;t have a solid plan for the future.</p>
<p>Yeah Nintendo is really suffering.  They MUST produce a wealth of fun and highly profitable games to survive the next round.  Their hardware is quite far behind and, though the Wii U is much more powerful than the Wii, the U will show it&#8217;s age within a year or two.  The developers can already tap out the resources available on the 360 and PS3.  What makes Nintendo think that the Wii U hardware won&#8217;t be mastered and limiting within its first year out?  At least for the multi-platform titles, a Wii U will only offer the same experience graphic-wise, so I can&#8217;t figure out how to get excited for a new Nintendo console.  I do respect the company&#8217;s history, but they&#8217;ve lost their drive to be #1 and it makes me uninterested in ever owning a current/next gen Nintendo console ever again.</p>
<p>If people are saying that Xbox and PS3 graphics are showing their age and the Wii U is only comparable with current console graphics, then the Wii U is already out dated.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Last of Us&#8217; would like have a word with these &#8220;people&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Last of Us is slightly better than the last Uncharted technically, has higher quality assets (which isn&#8217;t a power thing), and has much more locked off and claustrophobic environments. It&#8217;s visually beautiful, but it&#8217;s not technologically special.</p>
<p>Does anyone else think that it would better serve Nintendo to become a software only company?  I know the Wii was cheap to make and the accessory sales were huge, but it looks like the margin on the WiiU will be far less.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t kill them to produce titles for Xbox/Playstation brands.  But you have to wonder whether that would be good for consoles in the long run.  Less competition may or may not provide some extra breathing room for both Sony and Microsoft.  Softer competition environments tend to favor less innovation as the urgency isn&#8217;t as heightened.  It&#8217;s theoretical and, at this time, completely irrelevant since Nintendo is still around.  We&#8217;ll see how things pan out in the coming years.</p>
<p>The Wii was behind the graphics level of the PS3 and Xbox 360 and they didn&#8217;t suffer from bad sales. So after seeing this (it&#8217;s basically a Xbox 360 2, no big innovations, only more cores) I&#8217;m pretty sure the Wii U has a BIG chance against them. The ZombiU games with that second screen is great.</p>
<p>And Blu-ray in 2012? Really?</p>
<p>It did <em>eventually</em> suffer from bad sales once the novelty wore off. I have a Kinect but the stuttery experience has me reaching for my Xbox controller time and again. The voice controls are okay but I find it a bit silly to talk to my console.</p>
<p>As for Blu-ray I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going away any time soon. Certainly not for gaming.</p>
<p>Uncharted 3 filled most of a dual-layer 50GB Blu-ray disc. Obviously games are only going to increase in size as they get better graphics and more complex effects. The thought of downloading a 90GB file incites vomiting. Heaven forbid a file gets corrupted on the way down forcing you to uninstall and re-download.</p>
<p>And the cloud won&#8217;t save us. Just ask OnLive.</p>
<p>And people forget that some ISPs will throttle you data and have data caps.</p>
<p>Not to mention that no one wants to wait forever for a game to download. Unless they offered some way to pre download games and unlock them on release date like Steam, I don&#8217;t see disc media going entirely away in the next console generation.</p>
<p>I still say they should bring back HD-DVD for game storage only to try to keep pirating&#8230;. at bay.</p>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>So the 720 has an &#8220;always on&#8221; state. Okay, so while this might resolve the download issue (but not the ISP data caps) we&#8217;re also talking about increasing my electrical bill because this box never shuts down. Gee, thanks Microsoft.</p>
<p>Obviously it&#8217;s designed to replace a cable box, which, for most people, is always on.  People want to turn on the TV and have it on,  waiting the 30 seconds for Xbox to get to the dashboard is a hindrance that is not acceptable for the next gen.  I guarantee it will be low power while in standby mode, and if you are worried about the money you probably shouldn&#8217;t get one in the first place.  If you are striving to reduce carbon footprint, I think you can figure out a way to shut it down completely whenever you desire.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d respond again but just read my response to &#8220;dagamer34&#8217;s&#8221;.</p>
<p>For the record you&#8217;re right.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and Blu-ray is going nowhere.</p>
<p>Always on state or not, I&#8217;m not about to download 50+ gigabytes of data. And what kind of HDD will this thing have?! You&#8217;d have to have close to an exabyte in order to keep a full library of games, movies, music, pictures, and demos all in one place.</p>
<p>You realize that at sub 1W levels, you will use 15 times more energy from an energy efficient light bulb than when this system is in sleep mode?</p>
<p>I stand (actually I&#8217;m sitting) corrected.</p>
<p>My bias is showing.</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t for Uncharted, God of War, and the upcoming Last of Us I&#8217;d probably ditch the PS3. I&#8217;m also more of a loner when it comes to games (I seldom if ever battle online) so Xbox Live doesn&#8217;t blow my hair back like most gamers. Color me weird.</p>
<p>And yet I remain loyal to the PS3 knowing full well that Microsoft will probably be the only console left standing in a few years because of their commitment to overall entertainment.</p>
<p>Actually shocking that Sony is losing the war of Utopian set-top box  considering the entertainment arm they have access to. But then again this is the same company that practically invented the portable music player and got completely trounced by Apple&#8217;s iPod.</p>
<p>Man, Sony could have ruled the fucking world with all the chess pieces they&#8217;ve got but the constant fighting in Sony&#8217;s divisions (such an ominous word in itself)  have stymied them throughout, it&#8217;s so disappointing. Do you know why I think Microsoft will dominate the next gen; because they have a clear vision.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe I own a ps3 and haven&#8217;t played the Uncharted games, especially seeing what Naughty Dog have with The Last of Us. That E3 Trailer has to be one of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen on a console.</p>
<p>There is always the option of unplugging. Besides, if it&#8217;s plugged in and not on, it&#8217;s using juice  anyway.</p>
<p>At one time, I put all devices that did not need to be turned on all the time, on one power trip. TV, surround sound, lamp for example. I put the other things that I wanted always on on another. DVR, router.  This saved me a few bucks a month since I would just power the strip with the TV on it when I got home and power it off when I left the house.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised by the fate smart glass is getting some places&#8230;. personally I can&#8217;t wait for it. I&#8217;d love to be able to jump to a friends game in Halo 4 from my iPad without jumping through menus.</p>
<p>Naah they&#8217;ll be fine. A little Mario goes a long way for a lot of people.</p>
<p>They deserve it.</p>
<p>ARM?? NO!!!!</p>
<p>Using ARM as the processor for the next gen Xbox seem make sense, Game AI are usually heavily multithreaded and the it will still use Desktop Class Graphic Chip (The thing that matter most for Graphic quality)</p>
<p>ARM was specifically circled and said &#8220;always on&#8221;. The current 360, even after several CPU and GPU die shrinks is still too noisy for even basic tasks because the full 3.2 Ghz PPC cores are running all the time the console is on. ARM is designed to run in the sub 1W range.</p>
<p>So Microsoft are taking a leaf out of Nvidia&#8217;s book, trying to copy the design of the Tegra 3 SoC with a low-power companion core for doing mundane, low-intensity tasks?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say they are copying Tegra 3 (considering it didnt exist then) but the idea is still valid. As far as tasks though, they don&#8217;t have to be mundane. In fact, it should be everything except for games.</p>
<p>Yeah I couldn&#8217;t find the word to describe it properly, hahah, so I settled for mundane. Alternatives were &#8220;routine&#8221; or &#8220;normal&#8221;</p>
<p>Its noisy because of the design. PS3 has a 3.2GHz Cell with 7 SPE cores that runs all the time the console is on, and it doesn&#8217;t get abnormally loud. I can&#8217;t hear my PS3 through my headphones, I can hear my Xbox though (mostly when a game isn&#8217;t installed, the disk drive is LOUD)</p>
<p>My fat PS3 sounded like a mini harrier!</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the DVD DRIVE not the Fans that can be loud.</p>
<p>Certain ARM cores are designed for super low power not the ones they are proposing here. ARM does have better power/performance ratios than PPC and x86 at the moment but Intel is closing the gap. The smart move would be to adopt as close to PC architecture as they can so developers can support PC and xbox with the least amount of porting effort.</p>
<p>Next leaked document &#8220;World domination&#8221; Nintendo is finished. Sony might be scrambling. This is awesome stuff if they can pull it off and they seem to be on track!</p>
<p>Has no one else noticed the part that says &#8220;XTV&#8221; in 2012???  To my knowledge we haven&#8217;t heard about that yet&#8230; maybe thats whats coming on Monday in LA?</p>
<p>that would explain this &#8220;leak&#8221;.</p>
<p>Good point but if the E3 conference is anything to go by I don&#8217;t think Microsoft is going to launch an actual TV.</p>
<p>During the SmartGlass presentation the common lexicon was &#8220;&#8230;you already own&#8221;. A clear knock against Apple TV.</p>
<p>Assuming the deals were in place perhaps. But it&#8217;s not like Microsoft can time when those would be finished. And whenever they are done, Microsoft would want to hold a press conference ASAP because there&#8217;s no way something like that doesn&#8217;t leak, too many parties are involved.</p>
<p>Of course it won&#8217;t be an actual TV.  But&#8230;maybe an Xbox that doesn&#8217;t play games?  With the dashboard and all the multimedia capabilities but smaller and silent, maybe built-in Kinect, with no optical drive?  What might you call that, if not an XTV?</p>
<p>The upload date on that site was a month ago. Not sure if that makes a difference considering how legit the presentation looks though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m definitely not questioning the legitimacy  of it :)</p>
<p>It has the concepts of Xbox Smartglass and that was announced only 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230; but this has only leaked today. If it leaked three weeks ago I&#8217;d take it more seriously. Not hard to predict the past and then put &#8220;2010&#8221; on it&#8230;</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t just leaked today, it was uploaded in early May to scribd.</p>
<p>My mistake, thanks for the correction. Looks very interesting then!</p>
<p>So do we reckon $299 will equate to £300 over here in sunny England then Tom?</p>
<p><em>sunny</em> England? :)</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Australia?</p>
<p>Its ironic&#8230; its all we have ok&#8230;</p>
<p>Should work out to £260.</p>
<p>Also apparently Nukezilla had this a month ago. <a href="http://nukezilla.com/2012/05/04/exclusive-next-xbox-to-have-blu-ray-support-augmented-reality-glasses/" target="_blank">http://nukezilla.com/2012/05/04/exclusive-next-xbox-to-have-blu-ray-support-augmented-reality-glasses/</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s funny. I&#8217;m just reading this on 3 different news blogs (including the Verge). It&#8217;s odd that no one would notice it for a month.</p>
<p>Even as a concept, that black rectangle&#8212;she&#8217;s not the prettiest girl at the ball.</p>
<p>probally a placeholder until their design team come up with something</p>
<p>if the xbox was made to look like it was bursting with power, and then 360 looking like it was sucking in&#8230;. only thing left is a flat surface.</p>
<p>Metro-styled xBox 720?</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re saying it&#8217;ll be a razor-sharp baby-shit green rectangle of indeterminate purpose?</p>
<p>With ads on it.</p>
<p>Probably, but in some ways its not actually a bad idea to have it looking like a non-specific AV component. If they want to sell it as a TV/Bluray/Music/Web/Gaming box, designing it in the usual console way to appeal to gamers probably isn&#8217;t the best way to go. A simple box might be best.</p>
<p>wait $300? that&#8217;s kinda shocking low</p>
<p>Would they be selling it at a loss?</p>
<p>Most consoles are sold at a loss, that&#8217;s why the games are ridiculously expensive</p>
<p>Also, I figure they might push a subscription model (don&#8217;t know if that specific term applies) to try and lower the upfront cost of the box, while recouping their costs in the long run over a set period. I reckon the pay as you use xbox bundle they announced earlier is a trial run for something like that. This is already a common practice with smartphones,  I guess they might try to bring it into the console space.</p>
<p>Yup, I imagine it&#8217;ll be an option but not the only one. This whole entertainment side is trying to get into the living room as well as dorm rooms. Sub models suck for the core gamer audience because they are mostly broke young people with no access no credit cards however parents do have credit cards and sub models are something they understand very well. If they can get into entertainment like they are planning they would make more money on a sub model and would fill the problem of consoles starting to plateau in terms of hardware requirements.</p>
<p>Having said though I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s gonna pla very well. No harm having it as an option but people are starting shift away from sub models because they realise they are more expensive in the long run and they don&#8217;t like being locked into something. At least this is the case where I live. People rather having a higher initial price and it&#8217;s a once off than have a recurring drain every month. I think this is going to become very prevalent in the next 5 years as young people become older.</p>
<p>One of the biggest failings of the Xbox ecosystem is that you need to pay for Xbox live. The complaint is that it&#8217;s a sub model. I know there&#8217;s a reason for it but it&#8217;s the number one complaint on the Xbox.</p>
<p>It might be a complaint but it is not a failing.</p>
<p>It has worked tremendously well, I&#8217;d call it a massive success if anything. They&#8217;ve persuaded millions of people to pay for a good service that all their competitors give away free (and do less well?)</p>
<p>Well I dunno, I know a number of people that can&#8217;t pay for the sub model so get a playstation instead, all in all though yeah they are doing pretty well with it. Personally Id prefer if they would scrap it and put the price onto the games. I think a lot of my friends would as well. When lure in college the less sub things you have the better. Finances are stressful enough without haing a recurring bill looming over your head just to play some games and unwind. High initial costs are better for us.</p>
<p>Agreed. Sub models usually turn me off to, just hate the idea of being tied into something. Sometimes they make sense, but it&#8217;s still something I&#8217;d prefer to stay away from. One of the reasons I was considering alternatives to the xbox when buying was the Gold subscription cost, I live in a country where neither the hardware nor subs cost is something trivial. The thought that I&#8217;d have to pay to play kind of irked me. I usually grab a gold card once in a while, for when I really want to play mp for a specific game, and then I end up feeling bad whenever I&#8217;m not using it because I&#8217;m &#8216;wasting&#8217; it.</p>
<p>But i have to say, if I wanted to be on XBL all the time, they do have some great deals which should mean I&#8217;d hardly have to pay full price, but with my lack of free time, I still always feel like I&#8217;m not utilizing it enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking similar, but that the might even go for a cable TV model instead &#8211; that it only actually works when the subscription was being paid. That would allow them to heavily subsidise a console worth several times the asking price, and recoup it back and more the longer the generation went on for.</p>
<p>They might sell it at either a loss or to break even. Then they&#8217;ll charge the earth for Kinect, once everyone&#8217;s reflexively bought an Xbox.</p>
<p>As Garrus Vakarian would say: &#8220;.. and I&#8217;m OK with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the kinect will be included because its going to be the interface for their new entertainment stuff and using a game pad to type and navigate stuff is as frustrating as hell.</p>
<p>Yep, the slide says $299 with Kinect V2</p>
<p>MS just seems to like $399, so the fact it would be $100 less and then also even include kinect just seems too low. Unless that means they aren&#8217;t doing an actual 6 to 7 year leap hardware wise (mainly gpu wise), which would kinda bum me out a little. Going from 512 shared to 4 gb is pretty nice though, devs have to be extremely excited about that. At the same time maybe they can take the hit and they&#8217;re just hoping to sell as much as possible because live/software wise they&#8217;ll break even sooner I would think they would. That and even with the 360 they were really fast with stealth launches with cheaper hardware inside. So looking into the future i guess they may see a fast price cuts with production.</p>
<p>Side Note&#8230;. if the glass are small and light, I&#8217;ll be perfectly fine wearing those if it adds anything worth while.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what GM means here, but on the slide with price is a section about profitability, it says <strong>GM positive every year of the lifecycle</strong>.</p>
<p>Gross Margin?</p>
<p>Grand Master</p>
<p>Goof Maker?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that a new player has arrived in the  form of the  iPad, a device that many will buy every year or two.   The next consoles have to compete against that rapid product turnover across a 10 year cycle.</p>
<p>People are not used to doing that with consoles but this next generation will bring new challenges to the industry.</p>
<p>Will people buy consoles every 4 years?<br />
Will all of these consoles be backwards compatible?<br />
Will there ever be a true &#8220;console&#8221; OS?<br />
Is the console product die as people move towards tablets?</p>
<p>We are at a new age so all the players will have to tread carefully and strategically to remain relevant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about subscriptions to services in the coming decade. Sell the hardware dirt cheap, get a subscriber for 10 years.</p>
<p>It was nice knowing you Nintendo.</p>
<p>Nintendo is dead and Sony too if they don&#8217;t bring something incredible to the table</p>
<p>I reckon Sony will be fine, but Nintendo are desperately losing out in the console arms race.</p>
<p>But Sony isn&#8217;t fine, they&#8217;re hemorrhaging money and PS3 is a big part of their revenue.  Ecosystems are the future,  and the only ones with it seem to be MS and Apple.  Everyone else will be falling to the wayside.</p>
<p>Sony have some ties now with Android, and if they play it right, their products can be seen as the cream of the crop of mobile Android gaming due to Playstation certification, like on the HTC One X phone. There still will be a console market in the future due to the amount of people who want to buy a box that can play games, and dont want to messing around with it installing better CPU/GPU cards like a PC owner does.</p>
<p>At least Sony has several other divisions to fall back on (consumer electronics, prosumer and pro products, etc).  Nintendo however&#8230; Gaming is (was) their bread and butter.  There&#8217;s going to have to be a big shake up with them to get back into it.  Just seems right now there is no valid competition.  I love Xbox but I feel competition is needed too.</p>
<p>Sony is fine because the PS3 also has lots of entertainment options, and of course their free online gaming attracts a few people. I think Sony will focus on multimedia next gen as well, and not use crazy off-the-wall weird parts like the Cell. Its good, because Sony and Microsoft can compete directly again, competition is good :)</p>
<p>Sony will be fine, they have other departments. The gaming section of Sony might die but Sony as a whole will be fine.</p>
<p>Kaz Hirai said gaming is a key pillar for Sony going forward. Along with digital imaging and mobile. Playstation is not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Now I am getting excited for 2013, but was there any good bits about the current xbox360?</p>
<p>If this is true, doesn&#8217;t matter about current.  3rd party games will get us through til then.  Heck, look at the ridiculous lineup for February/March now.</p>
<p>Augmented reality glasses + Kinnect &#8211; THE HOLODECK???</p>
<p>Holodeck = physical matter, this = virtual augmentation</p>
<p>Xbox Future looks dam good, here are some more tit bits<br />
1. Xbox 361 (Low cost 360 without XTV) launching 2012<br />
2. New Xbox Live tiers in 2012<br />
3. XBOX 720 will include skeletal acceleration (may be faster Kinect tracking and no lag)<br />
4. XBOX 720 will be quiet, cool and green, also supports always on<br />
5. 2015 will be the year where you will never need a new hardware every screen can be a xbox</p>
<p>Tit bits? lol</p>
<p>Do you hear that? Nintendo just had a heart attack.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t get the Internet in Japan. They won&#8217;t get this &#8216;news&#8217; for quite a while.</p>
<p>Considering Japan gets most tech way before anywhere else in the world this is a pretty retarded comment, one of the stupidest I&#8217;ve seen in a while. Were you implying that Japan is somehow censored like China? Please go back to school.</p>
<p>I can only hope this is some sort joke or reference that I don&#8217;t get and restore what little faith I have in the average human intelligence.</p>
<p>Who pissed in your corn flakes?<br />
Pretty sure it was a jab at Nintendo and how thr like to pretend they havent heard anything announced by anyone else. Case in point: WiiU Tablet &amp; the iPad.<br />
I believe Miyamoto said something to the effect anout how they hadnt heard of the iPad when they were making the tablet. Which sounds likr complete BS.</p>
<p>I live in Japan, and I&#8217;m curious to know which tech is supposedly out here &#8220;way before anywhere else in the world&#8221;. This was true years ago, but nowadays, things are out on world releases. I can assure you that a stroll down Akihabara will glean more diverse models of the same tech than anywhere else, but nothing newer.</p>
<p>Do you have Internet?</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m handwriting this and then telegraphing it across the ocean to your land.</p>
<p>Atta boy, maybe you would want to take your smart ass and read the OP that I replied to.</p>
<p>Done that? Good stuff.</p>
<p>I have no desire about getting into an argument wih you about how your own country is technically more advanced than most of the western world, I&#8217;ll just go find my paper ticket to get on the subway, would be nice of I could use something like NFC wouldn&#8217;t it. Ah well.</p>
<p>Wow. You want ME to go re-read the OP? Seriously? I suggest you take your head out of your rear end and actually read the whole thread again, including the other posts that corroborate my answer to your statement about Japan getting tech before any other country.</p>
<p>OK, yep, we have NFC tickets in the big cities. Clearly, that makes up for still using cash as the main form of payment, being eons behind in smart phone services, still not having the kindle(s), etc, etc. <br />
&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe you ought to read this instead, it&#8217;s rather relevant</p>

<p>Thanks for supporting my point. If I read this correctly, Japan was second in 2010, and according to this:<br />
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/27/fastest-internet-countries-akamai_n_1051651.html#s438338" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/27/fastest-internet-countries-akamai_n_1051651.html#s438338</a>&amp;title=4__Netherlands<br />
they are now 3rd.</p>
<p>Stop being so pedantic. Technologically Japan adopt technology faster than most places. If you want to be pedantic this wasn&#8217;t proving your point at all, it was showing wider adoption of much faster internet speeds. You could get 1Gbps in Japan for $54.</p>
<p>A leaderboard is different to &#8220;a worlds first&#8221;.<br />
Want &#8220;a worlds first&#8221;? try this<br />

<p>LTE was itself proposed by a Japanese telecommunications giant.  It was first commercially available in sweden but Japan was also one of the first few to have it commercially available. That same Japanese giant is now also the first to test LTE-Advanced and achieve a 1Gbps download speed</p>

<p>*burn</p>
<p>Used to be true, not true any more. Japan had the best feature phones in the world for more than a decade. They are about 2 years behind everyone else on Smartphone adoption rates, all of which run software developed in the US.</p>
<p>Japan is the nation where Nintendo and Sony are headquartered.  in video games, those and other Japanese companies (Capcom, Konami, etc) have been woefully 5+ years behind US and European developers.</p>
<p>Japan is not the technological leader it once was.  Korea and the US have caught up and passed them for software and hardware.*</p>
<p>*Everything still built in China though.</p>
<blockquote>5+ years behind US and European developers.</blockquote>
<p>Really?<br />
I&#8217;d aruge that all companies are former shadows of their ambitious selves.</p>
<p>I blame high development costs.</p>
<p>I like Capcom&#8217;s answer to Skyrim, Dragon&#8217;s Dogma, which is not 5 years behind anything.</p>
<p>DDR4? why not go with cheaper but effective DDR3 its not like theyll be any performance loss</p>
<p>The extra performance might come in handy if memory is sharing between the CPU and GPU.  DDR4 also uses less power which fits in with the &#8216;green&#8217; direction.  Just guessing.</p>
<p>ahh yes the GPU can def take advantage of the faster memory</p>
<p>What does Dance Dance Revolution have to do with any of this???  :P</p>
<p>&gt;.&lt; LOL ive made that same joke before!</p>
<p>all sounds pretty pie in the sky to me. doubt they&#8217;ll call it xbox 720. too much of a mouthful. don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;d bother adding extra cores and increasing cost just to support 360 games. just make update versions available on arcade. can&#8217;t see the kinect glasses being very useful either&#8230;</p>
<p>the New Xbox? lol</p>
<p>&#8220;can’t see the kinect glasses being very useful either&#8221;.  Seriously?  You can&#8217;t imagine a 360 degree full immersion Halo 5 Game being useful?  Or augmented movies, TV, games where characters, buildings are literally behind you or you can actually walk down a hallway?  Even simple things like game stats, maps, augmented info on TV shows (like they already demoed).  None of this is useful?<br />
It would be the closest thing to a holodeck when combined with Kinect!</p>
<p>No no no. The Holodeck was a reality made out of changing energy to matter, everything in it was real, tha was the point.</p>
<p>This is nothing like the Holodeck, it&#8217;s virtual projections and you need to have equipment to view it. The whole point of the Holodeck was it was seamless and real, you didn&#8217;t need glasses to see it. Why are people making this awful comparison?</p>
<p>Glasses didn&#8217;t work for TV because it stops people being social, they might work for gaming because it&#8217;s normally not social, social meaning your friend isn&#8217;t physically with you. It&#8217;s probably going to be like the kinect though, concept is cool but you only use it for a week. It stands more chance than smart glass or the wiiU of being functionally useful though.</p>
<p>Why are you so nit-picky? The comparison with the holodeck is an obvious one, and you correcting everyone who writes it in a comment is both ignorant and stupid. It&#8217;s obvious its not the actual holodeck, so no it doesnt reproduce matter like it did in the TV SERIES, but yes it is the closest thing that we&#8217;ve seen so far so the comparison is a natural one.</p>
<p>The Holodeck is a fictional thing that only exists in a TV series so Minot sure what your point is, if we are talking holograms then that&#8217;s a different ball game (this is still not like a hologram)</p>
<p>Comparing the Holodeck to these glasses is like comparing an F18 to a paddle boat. They are both modes of transportation but the likeness ends there.</p>
<blockquote>just make update versions available on arcade</blockquote>
<p>Re-buy a game I already own? No thanks.</p>
<p>Not only is it a mouthful it also makes no sense</p>
<p>And those glasses will be a pain for anyone that wears glasses. I&#8217;m willing to bet that no one working on those has worn glasses and tried to watch a 3D movie.</p>
<p>Six times more powerful is not enough, For Xbox could be ready for the future it need to be at least 10 times more powerful</p>
<p>Or at least could run BF3 at 60 FPS (With PC Equivalent setting of High or Ultra)</p>
<p>What they have there is benchmark gaming computer and gaming computers have plateaued, the machine you buy now will last you 5 years+ at least. On top of that this is a console, it&#8217;s optimised for the hardware that they put in it and all games will be designed to avail of this particular hardware spec. Games on console run better than on PC spec for spec.</p>
<p>This spec sounds pretty good to me, sounds very future proof.</p>
<p>A 6 times performance increase would still put the console as about about one <em>tenth</em> of the performance of a mid range modern graphics card from this year. A mid to high end PC by the time this releases would easily be <strong>twenty times as powerful</strong>.</p>
<p>PC games have been held back graphically for the last few years by the need to support consoles, and the hilariously low specs of the rumoured next gen consoles is depressing.</p>
<p>at least ports might work better if they go with a x86 CPU</p>
<blockquote>A 6 times performance increase would still put the console as about about one tenth of the performance of a mid range modern graphics card from this year</blockquote>
<p>Based on what metrics :S</p>
<blockquote>A mid to high end PC by the time this releases would easily be twenty times as powerful.</blockquote>
<p>Not true, GPUs are continuing to compete but games have stopped making advances at the same rate. I have a 5770 and it can run everything on max even though its a dated card. I haven&#8217;t been forced to upgrade yet.</p>
<blockquote>PC games have been held back graphically for the last few years by the need to support consoles, and the hilariously low specs of the rumoured next gen consoles is depressing.</blockquote>
<p>Some games, other games like BF3 were built for PC and dumbed down. These specs are quite good, dunno what world you live in but this spec is equivelent to an entry PC gaming machine. You take this spec put it into a PC and it&#8217;ll run most games without much trouble.</p>
<blockquote>Not true, GPUs are continuing to compete but games have stopped making advances at the same rate. I have a 5770 and it can run everything on max even though its a dated card. I haven’t been forced to upgrade yet.</blockquote>
<p>Unless you have some nuclear powered 5770, you, sir, are reaaaaally stretching the truth here. I switched from crossfired 5770s to a 6950 that&#8217;s been flashed to a 6970. The performance difference is night and day.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t run Crysis 2 on max settings (With the Direct X11 patch, mind you); I couldn&#8217;t run BF3 on max settings. The 5770 is a good card, but when you turn up things such as AA, it starts to struggle to maintain a playable FPS, especially on games that depends heavily on the GPU.</p>
<p>i coulda swore i saw a video for the next gen unreal engine.</p>
<p>I thought the same at first but it WILL be enough because by 2015 it&#8217;ll no longer matter.</p>
<p>Will there be some sort of post-apocalyptic apocalypse in 2015 that I&#8217;m not aware of? Because I plan to surive 2012, but it would be unfortunate if the next apocalypse got me.</p>
<p>hes talking about the move to cloud gaming in 2015 outlined in the document.</p>
<p>They are insane to think they can move to cloud gaming in 2015. Maybe they can try it out but they CANNOT and will not abandon the legacy gaming paradigm. In 2015 cloud gaming will probably only be applicable to the top 20 or so countries with the best broadband, and i doubt microsoft wants to limit their sales to those places. Even in the US there is probably like 25-30% of the population who couldn&#8217;t use a cloud gaming console.</p>
<p>Console and PC is not 1:1 in terms of spec : performance since a computer runs significantly more background processors. Consoles are, pound for pound, more &#8216;powerful&#8217; at pushing out graphics and AI than computers are.</p>
<p>Nonsense.  A computer can produce FAR superior AI to any console if the developers actually take advantage of the power at hand.  You&#8217;ve played too many lazy console ports.</p>
<p>OK, read his post, he said pound for pound. If you have a computer and an XBOX with the same level of hardware the XBOX will obviously win simply by the fact that it was designed for gaming while the computer is obviously designed for general-purpose and has much more running behind the game while you are playing.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not even remotely true.</p>
<p>Sure, refute my point without explaining yourself.</p>
<p>Lets say you have a 2 GHz processor with 2 gigs of ram, with the same graphics card as well.</p>
<p>In one box, you are running an embedded OS that only has access to 32MB of your memory. This OS has been designed specifically for the exact set of hardware it is running on, providing tons of optimization advantages. All resources other than the 32MB of memory it takes are devoted to running a SINGLE MAIN APPLICATION at a time. That single main application (the game) has also been designed to be run on this single piece of hardware, and usually designed to use all available resources to their fullest.</p>
<p>In the other box, you are running a high-level, general purpose OS that has been designed to work on THOUSANDS of different hardware configurations. It runs HUNDREDS of services in the background along with DOZENS of applications. It can take as much of the computer&#8217;s memory as  it wants. The game itself is also coded to work on THOUSANDS of different hardware configurations.</p>
<p>You tell me which one is better. I am not arguing that console games are better than XBOX games. I am arguing that if you took a computer with the exact same specs as an XBOX (swapping out the equivalent x86 for the PowerPC)  and ran the same game on it, the XBOX would run it better, and that fact is pretty obvious and indisputable.</p>
<p>I think it is &#8211; did you see the slides about layering in cloud processing in year 2?<br />
That would mean using some OnLive type technology to boost performance without needing local CPU grunt.</p>
<p>While I agree that six times seems low, it would run BF3 on Ultra no problem.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The XBox360 does some graphical things faster than today&#8217;s high end PCs. (Source: A CryTek presentation, can&#8217;t remember which one exactly, it was on lighting)</li>
	<li>Then there&#8217;s also the fact that you can write code that speaks almost directly to the metal on the console, while it has to go through a lot of abstraction layers on the PC. This frequently makes things 10x more slower on the PC than it could be. (Source: John Carmack twitter feed, and some of his interviews).</li>
	<li>For a third point, I would like to point out that you can do a lot of awesome optimizations when you know the exact hardware architecture on which the code will run. PC games are written to support hundreds of different GPUs, and when you bring in other elements such as the CPU and RAM combinations, well, the complexity just gets insane. So even when companies offer some settings like &#8220;Ultra&#8221; &#8211; they aren&#8217;t optimized for any particular hardware setting, instead they sacrifce perfromance on everything so that it will run OK on a ton of different high end configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>sounds legit! :-)</p>
<p>I wanna hug ya.</p>
<p>Logic is sound!</p>
<p>Oh nintendo this really is your end</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an xbox owner, but I really hope this isn&#8217;t the case. Every time one of these giants bite the dust it gets me really sad. Especially when it&#8217;s one of those household names I got familiar with while growing up.</p>
<p>Agreed. And without Nintendo we may have not seen some of these other innovations that Sony and Microsoft have come up with. Losing competition in a space only hurts the consumer.</p>
<p>If nintendo or sony bites the dust, it will be a very sad day&#8230; Both of them have brought a lot to gaming and are definately producing more games than MS ever can with their First party backing&#8230; In the end it&#8217;s about the &#8216;Games&#8217; and i am definately more impressed with the games from Sony and Nintendo than the 3 games rehash cycle that MS follows consisting of Halo,Gears and Forza&#8230;. At least the other 2 risk it with new IPs rather than trivial stuff like FB integration</p>
<p>Do we think its possible that the next Xbox could also become your TV set-top box? I mean could I actually have my fully functioning Sky TV and EPG running from my Xbox?</p>
<p>The one box for the living room seems to imply that?</p>
<p>The document says that&#8217;s what they want but that&#8217;s what everyone has wanted like forever. Cable companies have no reason to agree to this yet though, there&#8217;s a lot of advantages to staying in their walled garden, mainly control.</p>
<p>They say Xbox is their new set top of and suddenly they lose control and they start paying Microsoft a ridiculous cut. This is a concept document, I wouldn&#8217;t be too hopeful of that happening just yet. Apps a la Apple TV are more likely.</p>
<p>Hey I have no issue staying in their walled garden, I just want to be able to pick my hardware.</p>
<p>I can watch a Blu-ray or DVD on any piece of hardware I like&#8230; So why not Satellite TV?</p>
<p>And yes I know its a lot easier said than done&#8230; but its a beautiful dream right?</p>
<p>&#8230;.because being on different hardware is coming out of heir walled garden, that&#8217;s the point</p>
<p>To be honest i&#8217;d be happy with the ability to slot a tuner card into the back of it. Freesat, freeview is enough for me. Could even make it compatible with Cablecard in the US. In fact this is exactly what i want from my next Xbox!</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t happen, too amateur and too messy.</p>
<p>I can dream can&#8217;t i?</p>
<p>Too ameture like slapping a HDD on the side, right? I think this would be an amazing way to keep down costs. Not everyone wants the TV side, and it will undoubtedly shave off $100 if you can forgo it.</p>
<p>I can guarantee you the next Xbox will not have a HDD that you slap on the side</p>
<p>Speaking of the current Xbox. It wasn&#8217;t to amateur and messy then, so how would a replacable TV tuner be amateur and messy now?</p>
<p>It is messy. A console should be plug and play.</p>
<p>Virtually assured that the next xbox will have a user replaceable hard drive like the current model, integrated into the machine. They will do something similar to how it is now with a reasonable amount of flash storage on board like the the 4gb arcade model (probably more than 4gb). They will also sell a premium model with a hard drive. This model has worked perfectly well for them this generation, why would they change their tactics now? Doing it his way will allow developers to use target the onboard storage for games use just like the original xbox did. Don&#8217;t forget you don&#8217;t need a huge hard drive to cache games so they run faster, you just need some space set aside for it.</p>
<p>CableCard is too messy and requires full cooperation with cable companies which I never see happening. It&#8217;s also too short sighted since it won&#8217;t work outside of the US.</p>
<p>PlayTV does that for PS3 already. So what you describe isn&#8217;t too far fetched.</p>
<p>So is this what they will announce tomorrow?</p>
<p>The TV stuff was Josh&#8217;s theory. But I dunno, I think it&#8217;s gonna be a tablet. They didn&#8217;t invite any gaming people, only tech people. I know there&#8217;s overlap but surely you would inite gaming people if it&#8217;s Xbox. Also on top of that the TV stuff is clearly next gen. They said no 720 stuff this year, so yano I don&#8217;t think so, unless hey are bringing all this TV stuff with windows 8 as well which is possible and would be a big deal.</p>
<p>I dunno, I&#8217;m still going with MSFT in house tablet.</p>
<p>since it&#8217;s from this site(and the upload date is almost same as this site) i can sure this is fake<br />

<p>:facepalm:</p>
<p>/badjoke<br />
it should ne named xbox 2160 with 6.times.more power</p>
<p>The bad joke is that it might actually named XBOX 720&#8230;</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>I was actually depressed by this, not excited because it gives people an excuse to use that god-awful name that makes no sense.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t start with the number one, they went to 360 because it has meaning outside of just a number, so it makes no sense that the number will increment in any way.</p>
<p>Also, has the PS gone 1, 2, 4, 8, 16? NO, it hasn&#8217;t. Nintendo didn&#8217;t do the N128 after the N64. I&#8217;ve been annoyed every time someone has called it the 720 and now im stuck with it continuing for the next YEAR until we hear the real name or a more recent internal name.</p>
<p>yes, but if it&#8217;s 720, it would imply that they are running circles around the competition!</p>
<p>A 10 year life cycle, I really hope it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>For the kinect 2 not the console.</p>
<p>i really hope its not&#8230;. games will be held back</p>
<p>What is XTV on 360 that is suppose to come out at the end of this year (page 7)?</p>
<p>TV implantation on your Xbox, probably shows rather than channels. Exactly like apple TV.</p>
<p>Bear in mind this a concept document though, this isn&#8217;t a this is going to happen document, this is a we hope this might happen document, it&#8217;s a strategy document. Its more than likely not accurate so take it with a lot of salt. You should use this to judge their tack, nothing more.</p>
<p>Apple has more weight with cable partners than Microsoft and they haven&#8217;t got anything yet. I can&#8217;t see Microsoft getting something before Apple, apple just have a history of being good at this sort of stuff. I wouldn&#8217;t be too hopeful.</p>
<p>Microsoft has already gotten Comcast to write a VOD app and Verizon to provide a few live cable channels (but not their entire selection sadly). That&#8217;s more than Apple.</p>
<p>1. No way you can claim Apple has more weight with cable partners.  I mean, one word: CableCard.</p>
<p>2. The relevant issue isn&#8217;t cable partners anyways, it&#8217;s content providers.  Both have done well in this regard, but when it comes to television I think Microsoft has gotten more deals done.</p>
<p>Any idea whether this console will support incremental hardware upgrades? Like, the design of the new Xbox will be modular, with MS releasing better GPU/CPU parts over time? This would completely break the existing console gaming paradigm.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the impression the document gives, other than plugging in new wireless cards or output sockets as the SKU changes over the years. It actually mentions moving to the cloud as graphical demands increase, similar to Onlive or Gaikai.</p>
<p>&#8230;.you mean turn it into a gaming computer?</p>
<p>When you start adding upgradable components like that you introduce fragmentation making it hard for devs to dev and forcing people to upgrade because their hardware becomes redundant. On top of that you introduce confusion, confusion about why the console no longer works, confusion about where the stuff goes etc.</p>
<p>Next the console needs to be a lot bigger. If you want to be sliding in stuff you need to do some pretty crazy MB modifications and make it a lot bigger</p>
<p>Next you need to explain to people why they need a new console when their components are no longer ompatible with the MB (which will obviously happen).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget that the whole reason the console was reborn was because of these frustrations with gaming computers. Is why they dominate the market share at the moment. If you change that it&#8217;s no longer a gaming computer and it would be suicide.</p>
<p>Fair point. I guess I didn&#8217;t realise that the people who buy consoles are exactly the type of people who don&#8217;t want to be messing around with the internals at all.</p>
<p>Updating GPU ?</p>

<p>If you mocked that up, it looks really slick!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s from Reddit</p>
<p>You still should&#8217;ve taken the credit for it, I would have never known&#8230; :P</p>

<p>How long has Twitter been using that icon? Wasn&#8217;t that a recent change?</p>
<p>Can I get a bottle of A-1 sauce for the foot I just put in my mouth?  <del>-</del>- can we please get edits.</p>
<p>but what if someone replies to a comment saying they agree and then the original comment owner edits it to say &#8220;they guy below me sucks and he agrees&#8221; etc etc</p>
<p>It looks like this is nearly two years old. Glasses tech is interesting considering they haven&#8217;t shown anything. You can see the threads of Smart Glass in ther as well.</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s interesting that they were thinking of the glasses way back then. When I was reading the post, I initially thought it was MS&#8217; kneejerk reaction to Google glasses, but considering that this document is 2 years old, it&#8217;s unlikely that&#8217;s the case. Intriguing stuff.</p>
<p>So next week&#8217;s event: Microsoft has bought a minor cable company in order to get onto the board of CableLabs, so this XBox can be CableCard compatible.</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
<p>No. CableLabs and CableCard is too messy. They learned that mistake from WindowsMefua Center. The future is steaming from the cloud, whether it&#8217;s actual channels or individual TV shows.</p>
<p>The sketches look too pro to be fake.   I could not be all true but parts of it could be true as well</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aQZOP.jpg" /><br />
Now we know that this is indeed a genuine Microsoft document.</p>
<p>but the image you just showed has nothing to do with Xbox or gaming.. show something about games and Xbox then we can talk.</p>
<p>It was in the ,pdf; it&#8217;s related to Microsoft.</p>
<p>It was also a tongue-in-cheek comment.</p>
<p>oh really ? then I have doubts about the authenticity of this .. lol</p>
<p>Yeah &#8230; I was slightly taken aback when I saw the image in the .pdf, it did seem quite blatant but it is supposed to be an internal document afterall.</p>
<p>But doesnt it come off to anyone else as a little too amateur? Those drawings are my biggest problem with this &#8220;leek&#8221;.</p>
<p>Dunno &#8211; I do get what you mean though, some of the images included in this .pdf are questionable but most seem fairly legit and I just can&#8217;t imagine this being someone&#8217;s prank.</p>
<p>Well the drawings look quite good..  but its also possible someone might be trying to play an elborate prank &#8230; someone with a lot of time perhaps.</p>
<p>Or it could be some research docment carried out by interns /student  or some other people . The way MS has been mum about their next generation console I doubt something this sensitive will be online for all to see at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah, but in the context of the document, the image is used in a section about how DEVELOPERS can make more money.  Not Microsoft itself.</p>
<p>Why? If someone is writing up a boring ass checklist of sparkly stuff they&#8217;ve been working on for years, why shouldn&#8217;t they inject some humor into their report?</p>
<p>Drawn with care by Steve Ballmer</p>
<p>God, I love reading The Verge, but looking at so many stupid people writing even more stupid comments makes me sick. It&#8217;s like reading the comments on IGN or Gamespot. You think Nintendo and Sony is doomed just because there has been liked some stupid document? Well, good for you, keep living in your bubble. Don&#8217;t forget the Wii U will be out for over a year by the time the next Xbox get&#8217;s released.</p>
<p>Stop being so hostile, the wiiU was a major disappointment to all the game journalists and it doesn&#8217;t have dev support. Ubisoft was he only house that showed anything specific on it. The wiiU is pretty DOA. I wouldn&#8217;t say Nintendo is dead, they are too big for that, but it&#8217;s evident they are completely out of touch and can&#8217;t adapt to changing times. They will eventually fade into nothingness, which is very sad but realistic. They just don&#8217;t have anything people want to dev for and people want to buy and haven&#8217;t for a while.</p>
<p>Mnay journalists actually said they enjoyed their time playing with the WiiU. They were disappointed Nintendo didn&#8217;t announce all the launch details they wanted &#8211; but the actual machine itself they enjoyed. And that&#8217;s a VERY important distinction to make.</p>
<p>The general feeli I got was the concept was cool but the hardware underwhelmed and while the concept was cool it probably wouldn&#8217;t be useful in the long term, probably would be a fad. It was also the only hardware at E3 this year, if the PS4 had been there or the 720 this thing wouldn&#8217;t have or any coverage.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be blunt though, other than ubisoft they announced no title support and it&#8217;s been announced quite a while. Without third party support this thing is definitely DOA, people already have a wii, the wiiU needs to be something different, something more, not just a fad. They didn&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how it plays but I would bet money on this being DOA</p>
<p>You&#8217;re really talking out of line here, Slick. You know nothing concrete about the future of either the WiiU or the next Xbox.</p>
<p>I never claimed otherwise</p>
<p>You said that Nintendo &#8220;&#8230;will eventually fade into nothingness&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you know about how well they&#8217;ll do? They could very well surprise everyone with the WiiU. Anything&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p>Ah come on,it&#8217;s pretty obvious anything anyone is saying here is pure speculation. Unless someone can see into the future we are all guessing. But yes anything is possible however very unlikely in my opinion.</p>
<p>I get your opinion on Nintendo &amp; the WiiU. But I must say history is not in your corner here. Nintendo has been second guessed &amp; thrown away &amp; left for dead by the tech &amp; gaming press many times before. They somehow manage to remain quite profitable &amp; sell to their target constiuency. their deep stable of franchises insures a guaranteed buy in of their hardware.</p>
<p>One could make the case that Nintendo was Apple before Apple was. If you consider that Nintendo has made their own hardware &amp; refused to follow the industry trends of the day, &amp; always have made substancial profits with said hardware, the WiiU is simply going to continue that trend. All console hardware is sold at a loss leading subsidy at first. yet Nintendo makes their investment back quicker than Microsoft or Sony &amp; it becomes all gravy.</p>
<p>I would also argue that the single best game developer in the world is Nintendo&#8217;s internal teams like EAD I &amp; II. They have that amazing knack for delivering high quality, that everybody copies, time &amp; time again. Why do you think it is that Shigeru Miyamoto is so revered? It&#8217;s not because he releases the same Call of Duty 1,2,3 etc time &amp; time again.</p>
<p>Yes this is all opinion but try to take a long term view of things &amp; not just the narrow scope that we are in now. Nintendo will be just fine.</p>
<p>^</p>
<p>Replace Wii U with Wii. Then remember Nintendo sold 94 million of them. I would not pre-judge any console.</p>
<p>They sold that many because they discovered a niche but that niche is now closed, those people aren&#8217;t going to buy another console, not a Nintendo one anyway and the didn&#8217;t sell any games to those people which is what matters.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think the latest Nintendo announces is disappointing then something is wrong with you. lol</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget, Microsofts current gen console has the same graphics capabilities as the yet unreleased Wii U and has more functionality with Smart Glass than the unreleased Wii U and better motion controls with Kinect. Microsoft&#8217;s 7 year old console is already BETTER than the Wii U which still isn&#8217;t even out.</p>
<p>The WiiU is both graphically more powerful and it&#8217;s controller is far more useful in gameplay scenarios than SmartGlass. The WiiU can stream 60FPS gameplay with no lag at all to it&#8217;s controller with separate views. SmartGlass neither streams gameplay, nor has anywhere near that kind of low latency performance.</p>
<p>SmartGlass requires separate applications on both the tablets and the games,  whose performance not only greatly depends on your network conditions, but on the hardware that&#8217;s running the applications. Which, is not the case on the WiiU, because everything is rendered on console itself. For gaming, SmartGlass doesn&#8217;t even compare.</p>
<p>As a clarification, I meant graphically more power than a 360. Not only can It render multiplatform X360 titles with better textures and graphical effects, it can also do so whilst rendering an entirely separate view on a tablet controller. And that&#8217;s just for launch titles &#8211; before developers have had a proper chance to optimise their engines for the hardware.</p>
<p>Agree. The Verge is on the Internets and you have to expect any range of comment to any article. Remember also that articles are often written or at least titled to get a reaction. This witty banter below the article is what ever site wants.</p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s real or fake, Microsoft is making glasses to be used with the next XBox. <a href="http://www.patentbolt.com/2012/03/microsoft-invents-projector-eyewear-for-xbox-beyond.html" target="_blank">http://www.patentbolt.com/2012/03/microsoft-invents-projector-eyewear-for-xbox-beyond.html</a></p>
<p>Lots of hyperbole in here. While I think this stuff looks awesome, this by no means Nintendo or Sony are going to be destroyed by Microsoft. It doesn&#8217;t work that way. There is no guarantee for success. Nintendo learned that when Sony dominated two gens (PS1 and PS2), and Sony learned it this gen. Microsoft still has the most to prove in gaming, and have yet to have the most popular or highest selling console.</p>
<p>The Xbox is the most popular and highest selling console right now actually.</p>
<p>In America, yes. Worldwide, not so much. The PS3 outsells the 360 worldwide quite often. Though it is usually close. Same goes for when the 360 outsells the PS3 worldwide.</p>
<p>Again nope. The 360 is the best selling game console globally.</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Yes it is, is google really that difficult to use?</p>

<p>The Wii is the best selling console of this gen &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;This gen&#8221;?  We&#8217;re not talking about &#8220;this gen&#8221;, we&#8217;re talking about right now (and for the previous two years running).  The Wii racking up huge sales in the first half of this gen isn&#8217;t relevant to what&#8217;s going on right now.</p>
<p>So let me see, &#8220;Best selling console&#8221; is therefore defined as &#8220;whenever my favorite console started being first&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>The Wii has sold more than 95 million consoles, while both the 360 and the PS3 are barely above 60 million. That&#8217;s more than 50% more, in other words, the 360 would need another 3 years to catch the Wii as it stands now (assuming not a single fucking Wii is ever sold again).</p>
<p>Well, since &#8220;best selling console&#8221; is merely defined as &#8220;the console that has sold more&#8221;, the Wii is the non-controversial winner of this category, not only that, but Nintendo has also masacred both Sony and Microsoft on Revenues and Profit. And that&#8217;s without even factoring in the Nintendo DS which wiped the floor with the PSP (twice as many consoles, if not a little bit more).</p>
<p>Your concept &#8220;of best selling now&#8221; is also a triviallity not worth much because its leading margin as of today is so slim it won&#8217;t even catch up with the Wii.</p>
<p>Also, wordwide is a tricky figure, there are more Wiis in Japan, Europe and the US than there PS3 and X360s. There are more PS3s in Japan and Europe than 360s. The only market the 360 can claim to have won is the US&#8230;</p>
<p>These are facts, and aren&#8217;t open to discussion.</p>
<p>Not the previous 2 years running. where do people get this wrong information from?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;re looking at that chart correctly.</p>
<p>This is what I said: <blockquote>The Xbox is the most popular and highest selling console right now actually.</blockquote></p>
<p>Xbox is the highest selling at the moment.</p>
<p>Who cares about &#8220;right now&#8221; if you lost $1 billion 2-3 years ago. A bank account does not have amnesia and forget the past.</p>
<p>The Wii sold the most console units over its entire lifetime. Period.</p>
<p>LOL.<br />
Would you rather be in Nintendo&#8217;s or Microsoft&#8217;s shoes right now?<br />
Only a Nintendo fanboy would choose Nintendo&#8217;s shoes.</p>
<p>What? You mean the shoes that sold 150 million portable consoles and almost 100 million consoles vs the shoes of a company who didn&#8217;t sell that many home consoles both of his gens combined? I think you need to be pretty stupid to pick Microsoft&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>To question Nintendo success is just laghuable and worthy of the tittle of delusional stupidity.</p>
<p>Thanks for proving my point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Nintendo fanboy? Of course! That&#8217;s exactly why I own all three! Precisely why I own both a DS and PSP!</p>
<p>I presented raw numbers, don&#8217;t try calling me a fanboy when you&#8217;re ignoring all data. Nintendo was the big winner of this gen,  you&#8217;re just stupid.</p>
<p>When I said most popular or highest selling in my original post, I was talking about at the end of a console gen. That&#8217;s why Microsoft has much to still prove. You misunderstood what I was saying. Though it&#8217;s my fault for continuing this petty disagreement.</p>
<p>Microsoft have not dominated a console gen. They likely never will; Sony and Nintendo may not ever dominate again either. What&#8217;s more likely to happen is a repeat of this gen where all the consoles sale great, but no one console completely dominates like the PS1 and PS2 did. Even though the Wii has sold the most, it hasn&#8217;t dominated on the scale of those two systems.</p>
<p>Its not the end of the gen for Sony or MSFT so you can&#8217;t make this comparison.</p>
<p>Ummmm sorry but the Wii is actually far &amp; away the sales champ this generation. The 360 has no chance of ever catchiong it. Much less the PS3.</p>
<p>Wii has most sells this gen but currently the highest selling console in the world is the Xbox</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll not dispute that at all. But if we are playing a pure numbers game here Nintendo is still the undisputed winner of this generation. They have a bigger installed base &amp; have made quite a robust profit, certainly higher than Sony &amp; Microsoft have. Nintendo has a long history of success when told they would fail.</p>
<p>The Wii&#8217;s &#8220;bigger installed base&#8221; consists of a huge percentage of units that are gathering dust in closets, and sales of new Wiis have totally tanked.  Nintendo knows boh of these things, which is why they are desperate to get this generation over with.</p>
<p>They sold most of their consoles with hype, not because they were actually any good. They probably have the SMALLEST install base if you only count ones that are still attached to a television. Just look at games sold per console. It is abysmal, and that is where the real money is made. Selling consoles to people who don&#8217;t play them only works once. Nobody is going to buy a replacement for something that sits in their closet.</p>
<p>can you provide some sauce?</p>
<p>That depends&#8230;</p>
<p>Bar B Que or Sweet N Sour?</p>
<p>The difference between the PS3 and the X360 is less than 5%. and considering the PS3 came after the X360, I would say this &#8220;Americal ilusion&#8221; of the X360 winning  is rather silly.</p>
<p>The difference is less than 5% so the one that is ahead isn&#8217;t really winning?</p>
<p>smh&#8230;</p>
<p>What are you talking about? The Wii is winning by a wide margin, I&#8217;m merely pointing out the differnce between the PS3 and X360 is very small, especially because the PS3 was released after the X360&#8230;</p>
<p>Face rolled.</p>
<p>They were back and forth for a while but for the past two years XBOX has been ahead worldwide pretty much every quarter. Wii still destroys both on generational number though</p>
<p>Not the past two years at all. Not sure where people get that wrong information from. <br />
<a href="http://www.shoptonews.net/2011/10/28/ps3-is-top-selling-console-in-2011-worldwide/" target="_blank">http://www.shoptonews.net/2011/10/28/ps3-is-top-selling-console-in-2011-worldwide/</a></p>
<p>It only outsold it during  Christmas 2011 with Kinect. in 2010 it was also being ousold by both PS3 and Wii</p>
<p>I read a chart wrong. But it has been outselling all this year, since christmas, every month. it also has more total worldwide sales for the generation.</p>
<p>Well at least you looked at the charts, a lot of people just hear something then repeat it. Wii has the higher worldwide sales for the generation.<br />
 <br />
There is no independent source for worldwide sales for anything after Christmas 2011. No Q1 2012 results. The only source of worldwide sales data I&#8217;ve seen for year-to-date is VGChartz (which has the PS3 leading globally each week ) but those too are guesstimates  I believe.</p>
<p>Thats true, the claims that they have been outselling in the months of 2012 HAVE come from Microsoft&#8217;s own press releases.</p>
<p>If the Playstation division read this, I am expecting PS4 to have 4K and glaseless 3D PSTV bundled that works with all games.</p>
<p>Yup. Because the PS3 hasn&#8217;t already had years of development in the features that they&#8217;ve been working on and they can just adapt to an article that comes out a year or less than when their console is released and mimic all the features.</p>
<p>Really Verge? Your source for this is NeoGAF?</p>
<p>This is polygon</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually a via, as in that&#8217;s where we saw it posted originally. The source is the document.</p>
<p>Uh, a lot of things have been leaked on NeoGAF and turned out to be true.</p>
<p>I have a question for the gamers here, I cohost a show about gaming with a friend who is VERY pro-console, and a journalist friend who flies to each event, he flew from his usual home base of London to LA for E3, who is strictly PC and Xbox gaming, heavily leaning towards PC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m neither really, my PS3 has recently broken (optical drive error), and if they charge me &#8220;too much&#8221;, I simply wont replace it, I&#8217;m not having one of those ugly ass &#8220;Slim PS3&#8217;s&#8221; without ANY of the features of my launch 60GB unit in the house, no way.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll happily stick to iOS gaming, even though I love playing 5+ hours a week of Battlefield 3 online with friends, and despite the fact I&#8217;m hugely excited for GTA 5.  I&#8217;ll watch videos of gameplay online, download the ripped radiostation audio etc and enjoy that as is.</p>
<p>This &#8220;Xbox 720&#8221;, while the documents are old, and it mostly sounds like the Wii to Wii U route, ie not really improving the hardware (because you CANT, not by much), just adding new gadgets into the mix.  IE, its a souped up Xbox 360 &#8211; now with &#8220;kinect 2&#8221; offering better resolution cameras, and this 2014 predicted &#8220;VR headset&#8221;, along with a bunch more RAM and cores.</p>
<p>Question for you guys :  Would you prefer like me faster, more frequent console updates aiming for middle of the road specs, and replacing them every 3 years or so, or do you want &quot;we&#8217;ll make some epic thing that costs the earth but &#8220;lasts ten years&#8221;&quot;?</p>
<p>I personally feel we&#8217;d get more out of having a more smartphone like experience, more frequent upgrades, more standard console hardware, where games would work fine for ~5-8 years of consoles, but with differing levels of effects.  IE, the iPhone route, where games CAN often run on the 3GS, but not as well as on the iPhone 4, which in turn is not as nice for effects etc as the iPhone 4S.  It would be a matter of knowing you have X number of total models (each variant), and having additional effects for each increasing hardare capability.  A little like on a computer, having different resolutions, effects levels, detail levels, it would know you had the single core iPhone 4 and show you lesser detail than if you had the then current dualcore iPhone 4S hardware.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think Sony in particular could do well with a &#8220;Playstation Phone&#8221; line, that would get an iPhone like refresh each year, previous generations would always be capable of playing the newest &#8220;PS Mobile&#8221; games, but with lesser effects etc turned on.</p>
<p>Nobody buys a new phone every year. One because they don&#8217;t have the money and two because their contract usually doesn&#8217;t allow it and three they don&#8217;t want to be buying a new phone every year</p>
<p>how many people buy a new phone here?    I know <strong>many</strong> people in real life who buy a new phone ever six months or so, owning phones ourselves (prepaid) as we do.</p>
<p>Even if you are stuck on an American contract, thats every two years, which is reasonable.</p>
<p>You know many people that buy a new phone every 6 months? What ki d of circles do you run in dude haha.</p>
<p>Most people can&#8217;t afford that unless your friends are buying 3310s every 6 months</p>
<p>Using myself as an example, I&#8217;d buy a new high end smartphone every ~2 years fairly punctually.</p>
<p>Especially in places like Hong Kong, you go through phones very quickly.  I have friends there who seem to have a new phone every <strong>month</strong>! :-)</p>
<p>2 years is vastly different than 6 months</p>
<p>a factor of four, yes :-)</p>
<p>In that time though, I&#8217;ve technically bought an iPhone 4, Palm Pre GSM and Galaxy Nexus, so thats around 8 months between smartphone purchases.</p>
<p>Many of my friends buy a new phone a year, a new phone every half year, or apparently even more frequently than that! :-)</p>
<p>That would be unusual</p>
<p>What you&#8217;re failing to understand is that &#8220;many of your friends&#8221; is nor a relevant statistical data, nor the rule of how the videogame console market works.</p>
<p>If any hardware company released a console under the premise that it would be replaced by a newer model in just three years, consumers wouldn&#8217;t support it (When the Xbox 360 was released in 2005, there was an outcry of original Xbox owners because their console became obsolete in just four years after launch; certainly no one buys a console that is to be guaranteed to be obsolete in three years) and developers would stay away from it; having to spend R&amp;D money to optimize for several hardware tiers is precisely why many of those developers left PC gaming in favor of consoles.</p>
<p>And of course, there&#8217;s the fact that business models of consoles and smartphone/tablets is completely different: consoles are usually sold at a loss or with an extremely narrow profit margin. That means that the platform owner needs a long hardware lifespan to provide enough time to  return the R&amp;D huge investments before restarting the process.</p>
<p>So the short product cycle you describe would be bad for consumers, bad for harware manufacturers, and bad for software publishers. Enough reasons why it doesn&#8217;t happen, and won&#8217;t happen in the near future, in my opinion.</p>
<p>The points you make sound like excuses for the current model of loss making consoles that hang around forever.</p>
<p>Consumers can handle a fair priced device, sold at a profit coming and being replaced every two, three years.  Look at how computers traditionally &#8220;were out of date as soon as you opened the box&#8221;, and I&#8217;m talking about 5000 NZD computers (4k USD), compared to a 800 NZD console (PS2 and PS3 were something insane on launch, 600 USD odd)</p>
<p>Smooth updates, that <strong>dont</strong> leave previous gen console buyers in the cold could work great- reasonable specs selling for a reasonable price (with a profit if possible) that get a new model every couple years.  Games that are developed for one specific set, with graceful failure fallbacks graphically etc.  ie not 4K on the models which don&#8217;t support it, less multiplayer characters joining (24 player limit consoles for BF3 compared to a full 64 on PC) etc</p>
<p>It&#8217;s better to have a reasonable, middle range and frequently updating device rather than some moonshot attempt at &#8220;being future proof&#8221; and having ever increasing console prices at a time when iOS and Android gaming is BOOMING, a competitor the likes of which has never been seen by the industry.</p>
<p>300 dollar consoles&#8230;.400 dollar consoles&#8230;..500 dollar consoles, it can&#8217;t carry on, with insane R&amp;D costs for each &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; CPU that near bankrupts the company (Sony).  Stock hardware sold in 100 million identical units provides the ideal gaming pc on your tv approach.  A real standard for games to be made for. That&#8217;s why the &#8220;Steam<br />
box&#8221; was so tantalizing.</p>
<p>Its an idea, don&#8217;t knock it till you&#8217;ve tried it :-)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a PC gamer but I&#8217;d imagine most people wan something that lasts 10 years at the same price. Which is possible now and what this document is all about.</p>
<p>Buy this for 300 dollars including kinect and we will make our money back on selling games and entertainment services. MSFT doesn&#8217;t make money on consoles anyways, they make money on virtual content that runs on the subsidised platform they just sold you. It&#8217;s in their interests to find a stable benchmark. Specs have reached a plateau, it&#8217;s possible to have a console last for ten years now and of be overly expensive.</p>
<p>Two words: cloud processing</p>
<p>It&#8217;s on several of the slides</p>
<p>Cloud processing simply won&#8217;t do it. It&#8217;s expensive to deploy, geographically  limited (due to very low latency being required), and extremely data intensive in a time ISP&#8217;s are starting to add data caps to DSL connections. Those slides are from 2010, when projections about boradband availability and speeds were quite optimistic.</p>
<p>6-8x performance increase? Considering the power already in the Xbox 360, that&#8217;s a very lovely performance improvement.</p>
<p>Also, one of the few reasons consoles have done so well is because of their standard implementation of hardware (and those like Sega and Mega Drive with all it&#8217;s add-ons&#8230; haven&#8217;t)</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to pay for a repair you can buy replacement drives on ebay. <a href="http://compare.ebay.co.uk/like/221043286332?var=lv&ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&var=sbar&cbt=y" target="_blank">http://compare.ebay.co.uk/like/221043286332?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar&amp;cbt=y</a></p>
<p>they are relatively easy to replace for the tech person so you might want to give it a shot. You would need to keep the circuit board on the bottom of your drive so don&#8217;t throw it out.</p>
<p>As for your question about what type of cycle I would prefer it seems you are describing PC gaming on a mid range cycle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite funny if Microsoft decides to support Blu-ray movies on the next Xbox. For years we have heard them convince Xbox 360 did not and still does not need a BD player, because online videos will &#8220;very soon&#8221; replace them.</p>
<p>I thought they would drop the optical drive altogether since looking at Apple&#8217;s new Macbook pros etc. but Blu-Ray is good too.</p>
<p>Not everyones internet provider would allow for constant 30 GB downloads ( ~ size of BD, and what games will likely be with the 720&#8217;s improved graphics) several times per month. Comcast has a limit of what, 120GB? (guessing here, but its close) and other providers have even smaller caps. On top of that you&#8217;d likely have to wait 3 days before you can play your downloaded 30gb game because of bandwidth restrictions.</p>
<p>Comcast no longer has a cap. It was previously 250GB. AT&amp;T has a cap of 150GB. Ripping out the optical drive is dumb because it&#8217;s cheap and most people are not going to have the broadband connection to download a 15GB game in a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put it this way: even Nintendo is using Bluray as the technology to store 25GB on a disc for its games.</p>
<p>Its an entertainment device though&#8230; so you got to have bluray movies..</p>
<p>plus games are gonna be 25-50gb in size&#8230;..     Comcast would go bezerk if you had to download that bandwidth (1/5 of allowed bandwidth as it is)&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, people like me like to have physical objects, im not a big fan of digital storage&#8230; I love looking and feeling my game cases&#8230;. and then I can trade them in&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope it&#8217;ll onyl support BR movies, as I don&#8217;t want to have to go through the whole installation process like I do with the PS3.</p>
<p>Now please start selling it officially in my country. We&#8217;re in the EU, FFS! It&#8217;s like they don&#8217;t want my Euros or what?</p>
<p>Whoa</p>
<p>Some exciting news I wonder how much has changed in the 2 years since that doc was produced&#8230;</p>
<p>Probably a lot. Hopefully the name.</p>
<p>i think XBOX will continue to be a success. I know i will get the next one no matter what, and i know loads of people who will too.</p>
<p>Im really interested to see what it will look like!</p>
<p>I hope they use an x86 CPU, a decently powerful GPU and Windows 8 foundations &#8211; not because of my interest in the next Xbox, but because it will make it a lot easier for devs to simultaneously target the Xbox and the PC while ensuring the latter doesn&#8217;t suffer from gimped graphics or performance due to porting issues.</p>
<p>this!</p>
<p>The presence of a TV Tuner makes this a VERY compelling Media Center PC replacement.</p>
<p>That little kid looks awfully close to the TV with the baseball bat in hand&#8230;</p>

<p>picture Steve Ballmer swimming in a pile of money</p>
<blockquote>picture Steve Ballmer swimming&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>Oh god my eyes! Scalded they are!</p>
<p>Ha, yeah, I was just thinking that.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this could be fake document is they mention OEM&#8217;s and this bit here</p>
<blockquote>What is the difference in building on non Microsoft device vs building on non microsoft (i.e. androiddevices)?</blockquote>
<p>It is a pitch for OEMs to build Windows tablets?  Or is Microsoft licensing out their hardware spec to OEMs to build their own Xbox branded devices?</p>
<p>So which disgruntled employee just left Microsoft Xbox Division? Im sure kotaku or joystiq could dig it up&#8230;</p>
<p>The only gripe I have is the 6x increase in performance&#8230;.<br />
This is an old doc though&#8230; hoping its at least 10x with 8gb of ram,&#8230;  I want Unreal Engine 4 or whatever # it is thats coming&#8230; to look awesome&#8230;</p>
<p>cloud computing/gaming will make the hardware a non-issue</p>
<p>This not being an Apple device surely the RAM will be easily upgradable by the user.</p>
<p>Do you know the Xbox 360 has 512MB of RAM? And the PS3 has 256MB. Consoles don&#8217;t need anywhere near as much RAM as PC&#8217;s do, and even with PC&#8217;s 8GB and 16GB is overboard for 98% of users.</p>
<p>understand&#8230; but the Epic guys said that these next gen systems need 8gb to play their next unreal engine the way it needs to be played&#8230;</p>
<p>That would be a PC, not a console.</p>
<p>I think it is useless to pay to play online games on xBox while on Playstation 3, it is free</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth every penny for the service and all that it offers. The difference is night and day. My brother plays on PSN for free, and hates it. He loves Xbox LIVE. He made the wrong choice years ago, and has been paying for it ever since by not paying for it (Xbox LIVE).</p>
<p>Please PS3 doesn&#8217;t even have cross-game chat</p>
<p>Useless?  OH there&#8217;s use in it!  I happily pay for my XBL sub every year.</p>
<p>The only disappointing thing I see in the document is the adherence to HDD instead of implementing a SSD. Isn&#8217;t this the future?</p>
<p>Is the future involving paying a grand for a console so it can use a SSD?</p>
<p>-1 for not being aware of current SSD prices and their trends for the future.</p>
<p>To be released in 2013, the console must be produced now and of course, since it going to support Blu-ray, we could see that game installation files would increase massively<br />
It cost 100 dollar to get a terabyte drive, while the same SSD we get for that price is just a fifth of that (Based on common assumption that SSD would hit $0.5 per GB in 2013)</p>
<p>For the Xbox Boot Drive?, Good  and must be<br />
 SSD as the only Drive?, bad and ridiculously expensive</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t it have a user receable hard drive like the current xbox? Then  they can sell SSD upgrades a couple of years down the line.</p>
<p>SSDs barely make a difference in gaming</p>
<p>Well, they make loading screens almost disappear, to the point where I now get really wound up by loading times on a friend&#8217;s console (optical discs are SLOW). But yeah, it won&#8217;t affect the actual gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Price. They&#8217;d need at least a 256GB drive and those aren&#8217;t cheap. They&#8217;ll offer those options many years into the future.</p>
<p>If it shipped with ~120GB drive, it would only increase the console price by around $100US. Worth it, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t unsee the leaked concept art showing some kid holding a bat up to his TV.  I hope it has a wrist strap&#8230;</p>

<p>I went through the whole presentation and the conclusion I arrived at is that Microsoft is suffering from a severe case of &#8216;upgraditis&#8217; and does not really know why Xbox 360 is so successful.</p>
<p>Xbox 360 is so successful because it is a great General Purpose Box. It does hard core games, movies, sports channels, Kinect games, everything, at an affordable price. The only lacuna is that it does not do Blu-Ray partly because initially it backed a wrong horse (HD-DVD) and partly because of management hubris at Microsoft.</p>
<p>What Xbox 360 needs is Blu-Ray, continual live and Kinect upgradation and continual price reduction. If there was an Xbox 720 introduction, after an initial wave of frenzy, people will be more interested in second hand Xbox 360s than new Xbox 720s because of price and perceived value.</p>
<p>Interesting!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<strike>on</strike>in the cards&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to stop day dreaming if they want to be on the top list again. Nothing is impressing about them nowdays. Nothing. I don&#8217;t care what your opinion is on Windows 8 and Metro and all of that. Microsoft is going down. Google is the new King. Apple is still the rebel.</p>
<p>Google has no idea what they&#8217;re doing and to even suggest Microsoft will fall to them is asinine</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is impressing about them nowdays. Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Says a random jerk on the internet.</p>
<p>1080p? You can keep that, Microsoft. I&#8217;m not buying a product that is supposed to last 10 years with only 1080p support.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s 1080p in GAMES. HDMI 1.4 supports 4K, but I wonder where you are going to get that content from.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info!  And to the rest of the people below you too.  I really didn&#8217;t know that about the 360.  So, theoretically they could support 4K?</p>
<p>I still probably won&#8217;t get it, but now for entirely different reasons&#8230;</p>
<p>I think most Xbox 360 games are running at 720p or lower. The xbox merely upscales to 1080p for the TV. Having hardware that can run games at 60FPS @1080p would be close to 4x what the xbox can do now.</p>
<p><strong>sigh</strong></p>
<p>There is absolutely no point in releasing a console that has support for video standards that don&#8217;t exist yet. The XBOX is 7 years old and it launched with 720p support, and they later added 1080p upscaling, but I think most games are still natively rendered in 720p. So I think 1080p is plenty right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also still convinced that the Xbox 360 dashboard is rendered in 720p and upscaled.</p>
<p>Really don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s that interesting about this document. All very, very predictable and it&#8217;s only a &#8216;pitch&#8217; as opposed to real hardware. Of course they were going to push the &#8216;one box for your living room&#8217; idea. They&#8217;re doing it now, as are Nintendo (bandy) and Sony (forever). Kinect and new way to interact are also par for the course.</p>
<p>Not saying I have the bright idea on what they need to do next, but I really don&#8217;t see any of this being exciting&#8230;.yet.</p>
<p>Take my money Micro$oft! I will take two at $299</p>
<p>Unless it&#8217;s got some killer first party content like Nintendo or Sony, I&#8217;m out.</p>
<p>Gears of War doesn&#8217;t interest me one bit, Halo interests me when the fanboys aren&#8217;t claiming its the second comming, and Forza is an interesting game, but nothing to drive me to purchase an Xbox.</p>
<p>Still till this day I don&#8217;t know why Microsoft doesn&#8217;t use all those Rare IP&#8217;s it has access to.</p>
<p>Who cares about Gears? There are PLENTY of FANTASTIC games on 360 and Gears is NOT among them!</p>
<p>1) I hope they use at least 8 core CPU and if they keep Power PC 3.2 CPU&#8217;s from 360, I hope they can work together with the other cpu &#8230; and not be there just for a BC.</p>
<p>2) They need more than 4GB of memory.. at least 8GB.</p>
<p>3) They should just give us an option to have a SSD HDD if we want it like that. it should be at least SATA III.</p>
<p>4) It has to have WIFI &#8211;  ac &#8211; NOT n! N &#8211; is last gen!</p>
<p>5) HDMI AND Displayport is good!</p>
<p>1) 6 or 8 cores really doesnt matter games are mostly GPU restricted these days and they might not be able to use the PPC cores because of different instruction sets<br />
2) 4GB should be fine considering its a gaming console so your not running a full OS on it<br />
3) an SSD wouldnt make a difference really itll just be stupid expensive</p>
<p>1) I agree, it&#8217;s just &#8230; I expressed my hope. lol</p>
<p>2) Yes&#8230; but I still want 8GB&#8230; all the applications&#8230; running in the background&#8230; besides how do you know it&#8217;s not running an OS? Win8 will be pretty integrated I think.</p>
<p>3) Well you can stick to your HDD, but I want an option to buy SSD. Not because of the speed that much&#8230; because it&#8217;s quiet and not vibrating&#8230;</p>
<p>its gonna run a console OS and even on PCs 4GB is still good enough for gaming</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I&#8217;m just a greedy bastard. I really want them to not hold back on the specs.</p>
<p>same&#8230;if its shared between cpu and gpu then def more geebees</p>
<p>2) Remember this does have a 10 year lifespan apparently, you&#8217;ll need 4+ in the coming decade.</p>
<p>3) An SSD would dramatically reduce load times of games by a serious amount for one.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I mean&#8230; 10 YEARS! How many times should I buy the same console? They should get it right the first time&#8230;. Wifi ac and an option for SSD.</p>
<p>Yeah I hope there is an option to buy the console with a SSD.</p>
<p>Bluray? Really? Why? What for??</p>
<p>Storing all the 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s till you get home from the shop.</p>
<p>What about &#8220;steam&#8221; like buying games?  Thats cool.</p>
<p>People keep asking for cloud gaming or downloadable games, but the fact is in most countries, the US included, broadband is just not there yet, and won&#8217;t be for a while.</p>
<p>dude, im in the 3rd world right now, and it works flawlessly</p>
<p>People all over the world buy XBOXes despite having no internet or very slow internet. Microsoft will not throw away that consumer base by removing an optical drive from their console.</p>
<p>To play movies? And please don&#8217;t tell me that streaming is better. Today, with the current infrastructure and caps we have now, streaming looks like crap.</p>
<p>For people who buy physical media and for people who don&#8217;t have stellar connections and lots of bandwidth. It&#8217;s pretty obvious.</p>
<p>should be cool, i have a PS3, but only just picked up a Xbox 360 last week. Only 5 years late!  we will see.</p>
<p>If Microsoft can pull off half of what&#8217;s in this document I think the WiiU may become the next Dreamcast.</p>
<p>Except the Dreamcast was awesome and under-appreciated.</p>
<p>more appreciated once it went belly up and then the warez world unleashed the easy ways to just download the games and play them&#8230; i think i have like 120 discs of games..</p>
<p>yes pirating is bad, but the system had already failed..</p>
<p>Will not be buying. I seriously want one console that just is for playing video games. I don&#8217;t want &#8220;an entertainment experience.&#8221; This is why I&#8217;ll be buying a 3DS or a Vita. If only the Steam box was real&#8230;</p>
<p>good for you<br />
you&#8217;re a special snowflake</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering if anyone else is considering the move back (for me) to PC gaming? I have a home theatre PC that I built myself that runs most games at the highest settings and cost around $600. It&#8217;s possible to go a bit lower than that and still have a decent enough rig to play games. Hooked up to the home theatre and using my xbox controller with the PC, I have a similar setup with &#8220;next gen&#8221; graphics already. Given services like Steam and Gamefly (their store has some decent sales) you&#8217;ve got a good setup. Even when the 720 comes out, I don&#8217;t think it will be more powerful than my HTPC. It&#8217;s not for everyone but the fact so many PC games support controllers now, it&#8217;s a viable option for some.</p>
<p>im building my next pc right now..<br />
i haven&#8217;t done it in 5 or so years&#8230;</p>
<p>Always on is interesting. Maybe they&#8217;re going to have DLC download instantly as well as updates whilst we are asleep as an optional thing. So say if I want just MW3 DLC, I can allow that to download whilst I&#8217;m &#8216;Away&#8217;. Blu Ray is also interesting. Maybe we&#8217;ll see developers add more to games because the PS4 will also be Blu Ray based as well.</p>
<p>Great move of Microsoft to compete with the home entertainment systems, just gaming doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore. Also the inclusion of BluRay is suprising, and very competitive against the Playstation, since there are a lot of people who have just bought the PS3 for the BluRay capabilities, and the gaming as a nice extra.<br />
I believe Microsoft is going the right way here, and I can see myself purchasing the next-gen XBox if the Playstation can&#8217;t compete.</p>
<p>I think we are getting ahead of ourselves thinking this will be out in 2013.  That&#8217;s the date listed on a 2010 document.  But Xbox is the best selling console right now, so what&#8217;s the point of cannibalizing their own sales of a perfectly competent product?  Its not like Nintendo or Sony have a answer to something like this waiting in the wings (Unfortunately).  Maybe they would release it in a year to prevent any power play by Apple&#8230; but frankly I don&#8217;t think Apple has anything close to this lined up either.  And the lack of any announcement of a new console at E3 is telling, I think.  2014 seems much more realistic.</p>
<p>A 54 page document labeled "720 9/24″ describes a system 8 times as powerful as the Xbox 360 that will include a Blu-ray drive, whole house DVR capabilites, and an upgraded Kinect v.2 with four player tracking and HD video capture and. shows a system with a 6-8 core x86 or ARM-based CPU, 4GBs of RAM, a separate ARM-based, dual core embedded CPU for low power media functionality, AND the original tri-core PowerPC CPU from the 360 for backwards compatibility. Despite all that they are targeting a system that will operate at 120 watts, a little more than half the power dissipated by the launch 360 and PS3. They are also targeting a $299 price point, including Kinect packed in with each console, and a launch in 2013. The document also points to a 2012 launch of a so called "Xbox 361″ designed as a low cost 360 intended for "every person and room in your house". This meshes well with the Xbox Loop rumors that surfaced earlier this year pointing towards an inexpensive Xbox branded Roku/AppleTV competitor.</p>
<p>In case anyone needs to re-read the files. Some of you are way out of line: <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/92821757/XBox-720-9-24-Checkpoint-Draft-1" target="_blank">http://www.scribd.com/doc/92821757/XBox-720-9-24-Checkpoint-Draft-1</a></p>
<p>did you download the pdf? can you upload it somewhere?</p>
<p>&#8220;support for four player tracking&#8221;</p>
<p>This just sounds dangerous unless you have a very large area to play in. I&#8217;m thinking there are going to be official Microsoft safety glasses, steel toe boots, black eye concealer, and jock straps in the future. Sure the Wii supports 4 players but you only need to move the controller a few inches to make it work as opposed to your whole body.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fine with all the media stuff, but Kinect 2? No thanks. I have no desire to jump around my living room like a brain dead idiot, nor do I want to shout &#8216;XBOX&#8217;&#8230; &#8216;XBOX!!&#8217; at my console to try to get it to respond.  Kinect is one of the worst pieces of technology I&#8217;ve ever seen, and I want to see it die a painful death.</p>
<p>i have to completely disagree with you on the kinect being the worst piece of technology ever. MS brought to the community a  camera sensor for robotics that costs a mere $150 where as a typical SICK LRF sensor would cost over a thousand dollars, but it cannot compare to the LRF sensors on a large scale but for a research and small scale end, the kinect camera i would have to say is one of the better pieces of technology around at the moment</p>
<p>A couple of points -</p>
<p>1 &#8211; Kinect doesn&#8217;t work. It just doesn&#8217;t. Even when I&#8217;ve cleared my living room of all furniture as it demands, and pushed my sofa into the next room, it&#8217;s still a jittery unusable mess.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; The voice recognition is spectacularly terrible. I&#8217;m English, and speak English with no accent. Just standard, unmodified, neutral English. Kinect has a hit ratio of somewhere around one word in 10.  I&#8217;m no fan of SIRI, but it&#8217;s vastly superior to Kinect.</p>
<p>3 &#8211; I play games to relax. Relaxing does not involve leaping around my living room crashing into walls.</p>
<p>4 &#8211; Motion control, when it works, which it rarely does, it a horrible, horrible way to play a game. It&#8217;s like taking a joypad, breaking all of the buttons, and making the analogue sticks into unresponsive lumps of jelly which mis-read virtually every movement.</p>
<p>So to sum up, Kinect is utter rubbish.</p>
<p>in my experience at my fren&#8217;s 360<br />
1. Kinect works nicely on a free living room, you might have to calibrate it a bit but works.<br />
2. English isn&#8217;t my primary language&#8230; infact it&#8217;s third. but Kinect understands me better than Siri<br />
3. you don&#8217;t need to buy Kinect games. you can still enjoy games with the 360 controllers.<br />
4. you can do everything in 360 without using Kinect!</p>
<p>Kinect has latency issues which was minimized after further update but it&#8217;s not perfect. the way it works currently is all the processing it done on the 360 machine and the data is sent back and forth. with Kinect 2, they are planning to put dedicated processing power right into Kinect to improve it&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been planning this for quite a while.</p>
<p>4 gigs of RAM?</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;d give themselves a lot more headroom with 8.</p>
<p>seems not legit</p>
<p>the documents are like scribbled child drawings</p>
<p>no way its true</p>
<p>I mean wow, technology right! hahah</p>
<p><img src="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/264/241/9e9.gif" /></p>
<p>Can you imagine if they make this ARM based?  That would destroy intel completely, because now you would have powerful desktop applications in devices that don&#8217;t have to worry about battery life.</p>
<p>Oh no, Intel wouldn&#8217;t be in the console market. What else are they going to do with their $137 Billion market cap.</p>
<p>Also,  Microsoft would run into the same problem they are running into with Windows 8. No legacy support.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen with the PS3 and the 360, legacy support really isn&#8217;t the most important thing.  It&#8217;s certainly not going to make or break the console.</p>
<p>And the reason Intel should be scared is because they only advantage they have is that x86 chipsets are still the most powerful.   However, if ARM is the chipset powering the next XBOX, then it absolutely destroys that advantage Intel has in the corded computer world.</p>
<p>But will the games still be boring and overpriced?</p>
<p>Looks like Scribd got a DMCA notice and took down the document.  That strikes me as a perverse use of the DMCA, but I guess what&#8217;s so new about that.</p>
<p>Yeah the page now says: &#8220;This content was removed at the request of Covington &amp; Burling LLP&#8221;</p>
<p>They are a law firm that is known to represent Microsoft: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covington_%26_Burling" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covington_%26_Burling</a></p>
<p>Digital Foundry is claiming it&#8217;s fake. They literally call out The Verge for falling for it lol.</p>
<p>If it were &#8220;fake&#8221; that would mean that Microsoft&#8217;s DMCA request was doubly disingenuous&#8230; I don&#8217;t think they would be that stupid.  Does Digital Foundry have any facts backing up its claim?</p>
<p>Unless MS created the fake themselves&#8230; in which case this is a crazy PR stunt that will completely blow up in their face.</p>
<p>Simpler explanation: Microsoft doesn&#8217;t want false information propagating about its brand and upcoming products.</p>
<p>/sigh</p>
<p>Simpler, but wrong.  It would be fraudulent and an abuse of process for MS to claim an intellectual property interest in something that they didn&#8217;t create.  Hence the use of the DMCA would be &#8220;doubly disingenuous.&#8221;  Once because they are using it as a club to silence the media and again because they would be using the DMCA process in a fraudulent manner.</p>
<p>This has always been MS&#8217;s direction for the 360. Look back a couple E3s. All the current capabilities on the 360 were envisioned years ago. It took them a long time to get here but theyre not quite there. The Kinect still cant scan things like the kid and his skateboard. The xbox still doesn&#8217;t act as a DVR. They also announced the ability to access xbox live through your mobile device, as far going into a multiplayer game in spectator mode. Its clear where MS wants to take the xbox and that doesn&#8217;t exclusively gaming. Looks like theyre getting there in the next gen.</p>
<p>Agreed. I spoke with a Kinect designer at SXSW in March, and he stressed the importance of extending beyond the idea of &#8220;gaming&#8221; into an entertainment sphere with greater relevance. He also stressed the importance of community collaboration and homebrew development on the Kinect, which is the first time I can every remember of Microsoft encouraging the modding community (anyone else remember Xbins?). Look at the way gaming has been integrated with mobile devices and other social applications (i.e. Xbox live) over the past few years. It shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that MS wants to extend their reach in the living room. That being said, I am mildly surprised by the choice of hardware &#8211; I half expected a system made with the AMD Fusion APU, which would minimize price/power while still delivering solid graphics performance</p>
<p>First Project Natal (city of Brazil) = Kinect; Now.. Project Fortaleza (city of Brazil) = Kinect Glasses. Alex Kipman is behind it all!!!</p>
<p>If 300 is true, the Wii U might be DOA.</p>
<p>I think if this next iteration of the Xbox is supposed to last 10 years, then I think it&#8217;s obvious that ms needs a service to compete with Onlive. If MS takes a loss on each console then what is the point of making all that hardware just to lose money? In 10 more years, high speed Internet will have even more penetration into rural areas which would help MS if they did decide to do a service similar to Onlive. With a service like that it might also get game developers on board to sell their games direct to consumers for a cheaper price. I mean can the market really support a 70-80 per game in 5 years? 10? They could in theory do what Apple did with the whole concept of apps but with game makers and maybe even small game makers. Thi might truly be the last console that MS makes.</p>
<p>There is a bit of whining and complaining about the ads on Xbox Live.  I use my Xbox to play games, stream movies, and watch Netflix mostly and it does all those things fast and easy.  Not liking the look of Metro is one thing, but complaining about something that still allows you to use the products core features fast is a little ridiculous. Ads are everywhere in most media products you use.  You pay for cable or satellite tv  you see ads.  If you pay for Hulu Plus you still see ads.  A gaming/media console promoting games and movies as ads to me should be expected.  As long as I can still quickly use it for what it&#8217;s designed for, I&#8217;m content.</p>
<p>Brawndo&#8217;s got what plants crave. It&#8217;s got electrolytes&#8230;</p>
<p>Someone&#8217;s been watching Idiocracy.</p>
<p>watching or endorsing&#8230;</p>
<p>It might be one of the most important documentaries ever ;)</p>
<p>this $300 seems highly unlikely for such specs and package.</p>
<p>august 2010, so much has change since then, I can give only 20~30% to this rumor.</p>
<p>This is what I was able to retrieve from the Scribd Document:</p>

<p>&#8220;always on&#8221; can &#8216;$%^@ right off&#8217;</p>
<p>With collectively over 100 million units sold worldwide sony and microsoft already have a lot to answer for for global power consumption from power using standby states rather than simple off switches.<br />
Sure <strong>I</strong> can turn mine off at the wall but millions won&#8217;t. Millions of kids don&#8217;t even realise power isn&#8217;t free.</p>
<p>Seriously can&#8217;t believe the Verge fell for this.</p>
<p>A $50 SoC that&#8217;s 8x as powerful as the 360 and only consumes 50 MW? Herp derp, fake!</p>
<p>CPU undecided? The current devkits would suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>50 Megawatt?</p>
<p>Would love to be able to replace all my other tv devices (bluray player, setbox, xbox 360) with this. Hurry up and get here 2013!</p>
<p>Not to add to this flame war (no pun intended), but I only mind the advertisements because I pay a premium of $60+ a year to use the online service and then I&#8217;m covered in ads all the damn time. I wish that by paying I would not have to see the ads and I could just have a simply circular interface in which every 10* or so is a new function. Easiest UI ever.</p>
<p>Now on topic, I&#8217;m sorta interested in new hardware but I know I won&#8217;t be adopting. I&#8217;ve had like 5 RRoD consoles which has left a bad taste in my mouth from M$. Plus their exclusives aren&#8217;t good anymore, Sony makes better hardware hands down. Probably just gonna sack up to PC gaming next generation anyhow. We&#8217;ll see tho.</p>
<p>This would never be a $299 launch device! Not unless it has a clause of &#8220;when you sign up to 24 months Xbox live&#8221; or  no internal storage included or box only (no accessories at all)</p>
<p>i&#8217;m a playstation fanboy but with no next gen console on the horizon&#8230;</p>
<p>this (might be!) my next!!!!!</p>
<p>My PC is already more powerful than this, and 99% of the games that come out for the 360 and eventually the 720 will be available (for cheaper) on my PC.</p>
<p>Your future tech is already obsolete.</p>
<p>Btw, it&#8217;s really cute, how everyone thinks Nintendo will die away. Even with their slumping sales, the console market shows them with over 40% of the market share, thats 10% more than either of the competition. Nintendo is an interesting company like that. They&#8217;ll do fine next gen too, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>Enjoy your outdated &#8220;future&#8221; gear. I&#8217;m already 2 gens ahead of you. =D</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost certain the future of console gaming is as a form factor with approved drop in parts that work with a centralised OS, and the OS itself is the platform, not the hardware. We&#8217;ve seen something like this with the PS3&#8217;s hard drive, but it&#8217;s not really a performance mod. Now if consoles could be upgraded (like dropping in a RAM/MOBO/CPU combo like the ones that PC enthusiasts like so much) THEN console gaming would be saved.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about creating an ecosystem with tv, console, phone, and pc all linked together.  I think the novelty of the Wii is already gone, mine and everyone else I know that has one are just sitting there collecting dust.  Casual gamers use their phone or tablet now.  I don&#8217;t know anyone with plans to buy the next nintendo.</p>
<p>The Metro interface would be great for the Xbox if and only if they go all the way with it. Allow me to pin any app or game tile I want to a customizable start screen, just like Win Phone and Win 8. Only then will I be happy with the &#8220;new&#8221; dashboard.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t expect Bluray support.  I am suddenly interested&#8230;</p>
<p>Entertainment 720.</p>
<p>If Microsoft just added the home media center as another node in the W8 family I just officially SHAT MY PANTS.  Can you imagine your Tivo playing Blu-Ray and connect to Xbox live to game the NextGen 3D games?  All the while Skpying with Kinnect 2.0 on your home theater system?  Also &#8211; it can run appliances and be your HVAC brains as well?  Navigation would be as simple as Metro UI is now and you could remotely stream your media content to a WP8 device and also check lights, security and pull up a file from work on your built in Skydrive integration for an office presentation that you can do on your Nokia phone?  Could be dreaming&#8230;..but if I can think of it, I have to imagine some else might have as well&#8230;</p>
<p>nb4sonyhasleakordecidestocompletelyrevampnewsystemduetounderperformance.</p>
<p>This sounds like a beast! But I&#8217;ll still only use it for games, thankfully the price point mentioned is gracious as can be.</p>
<p>they should at least call it XBOX 1080. so that people know its 1080p. and the PS4 with the 4 meaning 4K.. lol right? anyone? no? ok moving on to Apples Pippin 2. lets start those rumors lol</p>
<p>This is the best game so far!!  The app looks amazing !</p>
<p>Remind me of the great subscription ARG&#8217;s from the 90&#8217;s. They were really fun and innovative, but unfortunately 9/11 caused most of them to shut down.</p>
<p>Two words: Google Glass.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Iphone users are still cutting fruit.</p>
<p>does this work with apple maps?</p>
<p>There is no ios version, that&#8217;s coming later.</p>
<p>Shadow Cities? An iOS only LBMMORPG.</p>
<p>What does this article have to do with iPhones?</p>
<p>You really had to be &#8220;that guy&#8221; didn&#8217;t you.</p>
<p>think about the immersive experience on Google glasses</p>
<p>yea imagine in a few years if they brought in more augmented reality elements into the game, like using real time flight data and some way to take control over them.. not in real life, of course just hack into it someway for the game :) <br />
that would be really immersive. having things on the ground and in the sky.<br />
or even high jacking satellites that go overhead and use it to reveal enemies on the map and see how many are around your city. <br />
or even something like the google skymap on android, the one where you point your phone as the stars, im sure they could think of some clever way of integrating that into the game as well. its just a shame they sold it last year eh</p>
<p>Sounds awesome.  Field Trip is great.</p>
<p>Woohoo! Finally revealed!!</p>
<p>Any game that makes you get up from the couch and outside the house is a win.</p>
<p>Then you should check out Zombies! Run!</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.zombiesrun&hl=en" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sixtostart.zombiesrun&amp;hl=en</a></p>
<p>OMG! Mind = blown. This will finally motivate me to get off my fat ass :)</p>
<p>I love that App.  I got it way back in the day on my T-Mobile G1, I&#8217;d turn it on when I left work around midnight on my bike and it was fun.</p>
<p>Thanks for the mention &#8211; I run Six to Start, the studio behind Zombies, Run! Glad you guys all like it :)</p>
<p>I took the dog for a run with Runtastic Pro.. It showed my route on Google Earth complete with every pee stop&#8230;</p>
<p>You should also try football, soccer, and a host other games.</p>
<p>Eerily similar to one of the belief circle games from Rainbow&#8217;s End.  Especially when paired with Glass.</p>
<p>This paired with Glass would be amazing.  Lots of potential there.</p>
<p>I know! I thought that too- though, I&#8217;ll nit-pick as it&#8217;s thematically important in the book- it&#8217;s not the end of a rainbow (Rainbow&#8217;s End), its that Rainbows End.</p>
<p>This looks&#8230; AWESOME.  Seriously, what a refreshing idea for games, particularly mobile apps which can pull this off.  Can I have my invite now? :(</p>
<p>Sounds like Deus Ex, except without nanobots and A BOMB.</p>
<p>Oh, the irony.   Brought to you by the company probably best suited to control your mind.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t use those. A centaur named Foaly has patented those.</p>
<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md1ue1Xbah1qehl9po1_250.gif" /></p>
<p>Artemis Fowl reference! Yay.</p>
<p>Mad you can&#8217;t play it huh?</p>
<p>Does anyone know if it&#8217;s US only? I looked up the website and it doesn&#8217;t tell&#8230;</p>
<p>The app it&#8217;s not restricted where I live (Italy) so I guess it&#8217;s not US only   <strong>surprised face</strong></p>
<p>However not available in Australia :&#8217;(</p>
<p>They were saying on the forum that Australia and New Zealand are coming soon. I have heard of people playing in Rome and Beijing, somewhere else too I think that was no t in the US.</p>
<p>HUGE potential for local businesses to &#8216;advertise&#8217; in this by placing targets/pickups around and in their premises. A lot more fun than alternative &#8216;check in&#8217; services. And fun is the key word here!</p>
<p>Google are clever, they will make a killing from next gen 3D/GPS based adsense technology with this.</p>
<p>Impatiently awaiting my invite code!</p>
<p>very cool!</p>
<p>Ooooh, maybe here we will get the explanation for the smoke monster, the polar bear, the others and everything else?</p>
<p>THEY WERE DEAD ALL ALONG</p>
<p>Is that Julianne Moore in the trailer?  After her turn as Sarah Palin in <em>Game Change</em>, I guess she was looking for a more realistic role to take on.</p>
<p>The first time I watched it, I was convinced it was her. But upon closer inspection I think it&#8217;s just her doppelganger.</p>
<p>Amazing!</p>
<p>Looks awesome! Show me my invite!</p>
<p>Fuck, now I want an android phone pretty bad</p>
<p>For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?</p>
<p>For a cat.</p>
<p>This looks just like Shadow Cities for iOS.</p>
<p>It really doesn&#8217;t.. Shadow Cities is something like 4sq with a game layered on top</p>
<p>This is a rabbit hole<br />
<a href="http://www.nianticproject.com/" target="_blank">http://www.nianticproject.com/</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not an entirely accurate description of Shadow Cities.</p>
<p>Ingress, however, does seem a more advanced (and more fun) game. But the overall concept appears the same.</p>
<p>Regardless, thanks for the link! Looking forward to reading more on this.</p>
<p>google starts into gaming? how is this not on top of front page?</p>
<p>I KNOW RIGHT !</p>
<p>No &#8220;Apple&#8221; on it. ;)</p>
<p>This game has set me up for disappointment the rest of the day&#8230; Every time I get an email, I think &#8220;my invite!?&#8221;&#8230;.. Nope. :(  You play a cruel cruel game Google!</p>
<p>Oh well guess I&#8217;ll never get to use this.</p>
<p>Anxiously awaiting my invite</p>
<p>The needs to be on the front page and the VERGECAST pronto</p>
<p>This is not helping me decide weather I should get an iPhone or the Nexus. I need to know if this might hit iOS PRONTO!!!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hold your breath.</p>
<p>Has anyone gotten an invite yet?</p>
<p>Sounds very Daemon&#8217;ish&#8230;</p>
<p>Did anyone else laugh after reading the title? That being said, I hope this game gets people interested in location/augmented reality gaming. There have been a few of these types of games on both Android and iOS but none have really picked up any popularity yet. Hopefully this will spark new interest from gamers and developers alike to create a new type of gaming.</p>
<p>At around 1:29 there&#8217;s an ad for an iPad in the background.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m going to get flamed for this, but the trailer doesn&#8217;t actually show all that much. Everyone in the comments is fawning over this just because &#8216;Google&#8217;. I&#8217;d like to see more before I get as exciting as you guys.</p>
<p>The reason I am excited is that even google is recognizing the LBMMORPG genre.</p>
<p>Got my invite today and been trying out while walking around campus between classes. Getting a steady, accurate lock on your location can occasionally be an issue. There were times when I was standing right next to the object described and it would show me just barely out of range of the portal. Interested to see how things will play out within the coming days.</p>
<p>Anybody who plays this game will be teaching Google how humans will fight mind control.</p>
<p>I can confirm it here. Nexus 4 with MoDaCo Cyanogen <span class="caps">ROM</span> r7.</p>
<p>so now android phones have like 3 different apps for settings? What an organized operating system. Yet <span class="caps">ANOTHER</span> useless icon to add to the sea of icons that android phones have in their app drawer.</p>
<p>Actually it looks to be slightly different to the &ldquo;Android settings&rdquo; which provide settings specific to the phone, whilst this &ldquo;Google Settings&rdquo; app provides access to all (or more) general Google account settings, the likes of which you&rsquo;d normally control through a browser.</p>
<p>Well, I think that&rsquo;s what it is from looking at the app&hellip;</p>
<p>The Google Settings app ties into applications using G+ authentication. It also aggregates the other Google main services settings that are important on your phone. There are now Settings and Google Settings. Not very complicated.</p>
<p>I like the idea of a centralized account settings area for an account as important as my Gmail. Love how people try to turn it into a bad thing. Silly.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly not a perfect system, but from experience, organization&rsquo;s not a problem. You don&rsquo;t spend much time in the app drawer anyway, and beyond that, even when you need to venture in there, there&rsquo;s not much to confuse you. In fact, it&rsquo;s a fairly approachable, dare I say organized, list of programs. The other thing is that this app brings you to something completely different than anything else. Frankly, it is either useful, or a nonissue.</p>
<p>Saying this makes Android disorganized is akin to saying that having two doors out of a room makes it an architectural nightmare.</p>
<p>right. :)</p>
<p>Hell, what would three doors be, heaven forbid.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DOORPOCALYPSE</span>!</p>
<p><span class="caps">DOORMAGEDDON</span>!</p>
<p>I actually prefer not to have much on my home screens, except essentials shortcuts. So I do dive into the app drawer quite a bit.</p>
<p>The app drawer just holds all the apps you don&rsquo;t use often. If you want an app, you can put it on one of your homescreens wherever you like (doesn&rsquo;t need to be auto-aligned to the top left).<br />
If this happened on iOS, you would be pissed because you can&rsquo;t customise your homescreens much&hellip; since only 4 can be docked.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that on your iPhone, you have a folder with all the shit apps Apple force upon you that you never use&hellip; I do on my iPad.</p>
<p>Learn how to get rid of them instead of complaining.</p>
<p>If something is useless it&rsquo;s the need to have to create folders of shortcuts to apps you don&rsquo;t want to see.</p>
<p>Not to mention you can hide app drawer icons on most 3rd party launchers. Try that somewhere else.</p>
<p>This will probably be removed in Key Lime Pie. It&rsquo;s just temporary. There&rsquo;s only two settings apps; this one (as I said, temporary because Google can&rsquo;t update Settings as easily as they can update Play Services) and the normal Settings app. So, it&rsquo;ll probably be removed in <span class="caps">KLP</span>.</p>
<p>What are the other &lsquo;useless&rsquo; icons on Android?</p>
<p>Play Books and Play Magazines. I don&rsquo;t use either feature, nor am I interested in them.</p>
<p>Then disable them in App Settings?  Poof!</p>
<p>I remember looking at early Android in disbelief when it had Camera and Camcorder apps.  I know those are gone, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.</p>
<p>I found that very convenient, actually.</p>
<p>That news and weather app. Never used it, little redundant with Google now and currents. And 4 play store apps</p>
<p>Please name the 3 apps.</p>
<p>3 different settings apps?? Name them&hellip;.</p>
<p>If you open it us, you can see that this is related to the Google+ sign-in that was announced just yesterday.</p>
<p>Yep got it too from PACman <span class="caps">ROM</span> on Note II</p>
<p>Me too, Nexus 4 on stock android 4.2.2</p>
<p>Same here &ndash; device and OS. When the heck did that pop up? If I hadn&rsquo;t seen this article I wouldn&rsquo;t have known.</p>
<p>Confirmed <span class="caps">HTC</span> One X running CyanogenMod 10.1 (Android 4.2.2)</p>
<p>Confirmed. HP Touchpad with Cyanmod 9.</p>
<p>Actually this app does one main thing, not just combining google apps settings in one centralized location, but also for Google AdMob Ads! Maybe something to make Scroogled campaign look pointless!</p>
<p>Mine showed up earlier this morning, sending my immaculate app drawer arrangement into disarray. :O</p>
<p>I got mine yesterday and it moved my in stage am from its perfect position on the app drawer. Grr.</p>
<p>I meant Instagram.  wtf.</p>
<p>By chance I restored my Nexus 4 this evening, and can confirm.</p>
<p>This is without a software update or notification or anything? I&#8217;d be kind of creeped out if I still had an Android device and this happened.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s part of Google services framework app, which was moved on Play Store last year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s wise moving many components of the system to the Store, which can be upgraded without system update.</p>
<p>No need for tinfoil hats.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s poor practice to silently add things to people&rsquo;s phones with a behind-the-scenes update.  If it was a &ldquo;tap here to add Google Settings&rdquo; it would be a non-issue.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with it?</p>
<p>Nothing was added, the Google Settings &ldquo;app&rdquo; is part of the update that was in the Store. Why they push it ? To avoid stupid rants and issues of people about something not working.</p>
<p>If Apple did a silent update and added anything to my homescreen, I&rsquo;d be very upset about that.  I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s ok in this situation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s not ok. You still haven&rsquo;t explained that.</p>
<p>Settle down. People are getting bent out of shape for no reason. Nobody seems to mind when the Play Store is updated in the background or bugs are fixed. This is such a minor change and just adds shortcuts to your Google account settings. It actually makes it easier to get to these settings. If you don&rsquo;t want to see the icon, then don&rsquo;t put it on your homescreen; just keep it in the app drawer. Jesus, some people are frustrating.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;app&rdquo; is basically a hub of shortcuts to already existing settings in disparate apps (G+, Maps, Search, etc.).</p>
<p>This is such a non-controversy, but I guess it has to be because Google did it.</p>
<p>I would be just as upset if my iPhone did the same thing.  Silent updates that are more than bugfixes or similar are a big no no for me.</p>
<p>Lol. Really?</p>
<p>They made this for unifying the settings under 1 &ldquo;app&rdquo;, since pre 4.0 devices don&rsquo;t have the same Location, Ads etc. settings available under the Google account in Settings.</p>
<p>Just hitting this link and clicking on &#8216;update&#8217; is an easier method to get that Google settings app and update your Google play services app. Clearing data and rebooting is too complicated and elongated method compared to this.<br />

<p>Having a fun time reading the reviews for the App. How can people be so stupid?.</p>
<p>People are afraid of what they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Lol, I spent more time than I should have reading the comments. People are stupid. The best are the 5* reviews though.</p>
<p>Haha. If you want to see the best 5* Reviews, you should head over to Adobe Air&#8217;s page..:D</p>
<p>Yup those are great. "Adobe Air fixed my marriage/car/life/health :-P "</p>
<p>I likes this one,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an Airbus A380 pilot. After installing the latest update we are regularly achieving speeds of Mach 0.96 even with a headwind of 100 knots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow. <em>snicker</em></p>
<p>The best reviews are of Andrew Kachinowsky something something android apps called &#8220;Vortex&#8221; and &#8220;Home&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, obviously we have a <span class="caps">MONSTER</span> in Google Play. He&rsquo;s climbin&rsquo; in your Androids, he&rsquo;s snatchin&rsquo; your internal space up, tryin&rsquo; to fill &lsquo;em. So y&rsquo;all need to hide your phones, hide your tablets, and hide your Android fridges cause they&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; all space out here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that what the reviews are normally like in the Google Play store? Ive never seen people arguing over reviews like that, it was hilarious.</p>
<p>People always go to the Play Store to complain about the bloatware. It&rsquo;s very common.</p>
<p>And yeah, got it on my S2 Skyrocket.</p>
<p>Apparently there a lot of people with phones that have like 4GB of storage who like to leave app reviews. It&rsquo;s pretty sad.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a perception problem.</p>
<p>This is an &lsquo;app&rsquo; that the user didn&rsquo;t install and they don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s for. With limited space on their devices the users get annoyed when it looks like something they didn&rsquo;t install uses up the rest f the space on their device.</p>
<p>On my Nexus 1 Google Play services is just shy of 8MB &ndash; it might not sound like a lot but I have 19MB free internally, that&rsquo;s with any apps I can put onto the sd card moved there. Anything below 17MB free and I can&rsquo;t install <strong>any</strong> apps &ndash; It just says insufficient space, regardless of the size of the app. Essentially Google use a calculation which doesn&rsquo;t work out too well if your device has limited storage.</p>
<p>On the other hand the Google Play services installed on my Nexus 4 is only 4MB. I&rsquo;d guess more is integrated into either the base system or it&rsquo;s spread over the other Google applications.</p>
<p>Confirmed on AT&amp;T LG Optimus G in the U.S.</p>
<p>Confirmed on Nexus 7 too.</p>
<p>confirmed att gs2 running jb gapps</p>
<p>Nothing on my Nexus 7 or Toshiba Thrive, not that this really is a big deal when I already have all of my Google apps in a common group for easy access anyway.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve always updated this in the background, since it was first released last year. It&#8217;s mostly just to enable new developer APIs, without having to wait for OEMs/Carriers to roll out updates. Bit weird they made the &#8220;Google settings&#8221; appear as a separate app though &#8211; couldn&#8217;t they have just made it part of the normal settings menu?</p>
<p>No, since system settings is a core app and cannot be modified through a play store update.</p>
<p>Got it here on my GNex running <span class="caps">AOKP</span> 4.2.2.</p>
<p>Haha&hellip; &ldquo;You probably need this component.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh yup, just got it on my nexus.</p>
<p>I could see G+ as a universal sign-in system working pretty well precisely because nobody uses google plus. I like the idea of using facebook, but I hate that people can A) click through to your facebook and see exactly who you are and B) your facebook friends get spammed about what you like and comment on. Since my google plus page is free of almost any meaningful content and has no friends, this would be great!</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Actually, quite a few people use Google+.</p>
<p>Quite a few&hellip; hundred&hellip;. Million.</p>
<p>Exactly. It&rsquo;s not a barren wasteland by any means.</p>
<p>Found this yesterday, wondered if I&#8217;d just forgotten I&#8217;d downloaded it! #thankfullynotmad</p>
<p>I got it my Samsung Galaxy Nexus since we dont have access to menu button anymore :D no biggie just apart of Jelly Bean</p>
<p>Just got it this morning. The app is basically an extension from Google account in settings right?</p>
<p>All the setting&#8217;s in the app were on the phone before. It&#8217;s easier having them in one place instead of going to one place for location settings, another place for search settings etc. I would rather call it a shortcut then an app.</p>
<p>yea iOS did same years back :D</p>
<p>This ain&#8217;t the same. With iOS you have to go to settings to change any apps settings. This just controls location and what apps have a G+ sign in.</p>
<p> I got on my GS3. All is well.</p>
<p>Looks like they think I want their admob adds. I&rsquo;ve ticked it off from every location I&rsquo;ve ever seen it, but now it was activated with the arrival of this new app. Other than that, it&rsquo;s pretty handy.<br />
(Rooted stock i9300)</p>
<p>Why do you want random ads instead of ads for things you might be interested in?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want people trying to tell me I should be interested in certain things. It&#8217;s called profiling. Oh he&#8217;s a 50 year old man he would never be interested in dub step or let&#8217;s say music from anything close to DJ Shadow People&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh, I know that&#8217;s not exactly how it works, though you get the idea.  It&#8217;s like creating a Pandora station for &#8220;Anne Murray&#8221; and having Adele pop up constantly with &#8220;Rolling in the Deep&#8221;.  It&#8217;s disgusting profiling based on crappy crowd source marketing.</p>

They need a desktop, a few more Motorola phones, and a better GoogleTV product before&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the last quote may be especially telling. Could the Nexus program expand beyond one phone (and tablet), one manufacturer a year?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to restate my opinion that Google is working on really cool gesture software/hardware technology that they&rsquo;re going to implement in the Motorola X phone and offer to OEMs who want to work closely with them on their own Nexus phones. So pretty much the Nexus program theory (/rumor) from late last year with a huge incentive to OEMs.</p>

<p>Anyone remember Eric Schmidt&rsquo;s comments about <em>never</em> building another Nexus to sell online?  We all know how that turned out.<br /><a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-no-plans-for-nexus-one-successor-701067">http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-no-plans-for-nexus-one-successor-701067</a></p>
<p>What is this fascination with nexus. Nexus stuff doesn&#8217;t do all that great out of the tech circle &amp; google people.</p>
<p>Once you use vanilla android you don&rsquo;t go back. You&rsquo;re willing to put up with sub-par hardware to get it.</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 is certainly <em>not</em> sub-par hardware. It has a very very premium feel!</p>
<p>Totally, <span class="caps">TOTALLY</span> way off with that one.</p>
<p>so because it feels good its made with quality parts? keep dreaming.</p>
<p>So because it <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> feel good to you means it&rsquo;s cheaply made? Keep dreaming.</p>
<p>no. because the speaker is tinny. because there is feedback through the earpiece due to lack of shielding. because it overheats so easily. because the glass pops in and out after it has hit the floor. because the camera rattles. because the camera sucks. because its designed to muffle the sound when laying down. because of the hairline fractures the rear glass gets. because the screen sucks. because the power button sucks.</p>
<p>thats why is it cheaply made/built. i thought i had been over this before. why did you fall for it?</p>
<p>Wow! Apart from the fact that the rear is made out of glass, which while certainly adding to the premium feel, does make it scratch/crack vulnerable, I&rsquo;ve had absolutely none of the problems you seem to have.</p>
<p>Camera rattles? What are you on bro? And can I have some? Muffle the sound when laying down? lol</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking about the same camera rattle lots of phones have.  It&rsquo;s not a defect, I think it&rsquo;s a stabilization mechanism or something.</p>
<p>I know what he&rsquo;s talking about. And yes, most camera rattles are not defects, although some are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just having a laugh at his reasons. OH <span class="caps">GLASS</span> <span class="caps">POPS</span> IN <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> <span class="caps">AFTER</span> IT <span class="caps">HITS</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FLOOR</span>. <span class="caps">GRAAAHHH</span>. IT <span class="caps">SUCKS</span>. <span class="caps">CAMERA</span> <span class="caps">RATTLES</span>. <span class="caps">CAMERA</span> <span class="caps">SUCKS</span>. <span class="caps">GRRRAAWWWW</span>. <span class="caps">SCREEN</span> <span class="caps">SUCKS</span>. GRRAQQQHHhQJKA. <span class="caps">POWER</span> <span class="caps">BUTTON</span> <span class="caps">SUCKS</span>. <span class="caps">RHWWWARHHJH</span></p>
<p>i am talking about the only smartphone i have touched in three years having a rattling camera.</p>
<p>Yeah, I have that. Its the only one from what he said though!</p>
<p>Glass is so 2011&hellip;</p>
<p>i dont have any of those issues. the moment the phone fell off of the reclining part of my couch onto a rug and the glass started making a popping sound when i pressed against it&hellip; i sold it. there were 138k units made before i got mine on nov 27. and every single unit sold before and including mine had those issues. and they all still do.</p>
<p>as i said and will continue to defend&hellip; just because it feels good, and looks good, does not mean it isnt cheap, built of substandard parts, and built from substandard design.</p>
<p>It overheats? I have not experienced that yet. The camera does not rattle on mine. The camera is pretty dang good and is good in low light. The power button is solid and so is the screen once calibrated. I have 2 in my household and I have no idea what your talking about aside from speaker complaints.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fall&rdquo; for anything. I have a Nexus 4 and have experienced almost none of the issues you complain of above.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;the screen sucks&rdquo; is not a defect, that&rsquo;s an opinion of yours that quite frankly isn&rsquo;t very widely shared. The screen on the GNex on the other hand&hellip;</p>
<p>So basically, either you&#8217;ve never used one and your just making it up, or you appear to have been given a device that somehow managed to come off the production line massively defective. Everyone I&#8217;ve met who has a Nexus 4 is more than happy with the build quality, screen, OS. In fact, the only complaint I&#8217;ve ever heard is about battery life, but that was from someone who was coming from a blackberry, where you can usually get a few days at least.</p>
<p>for me its&hellip; &ldquo;once you go vanilla you never want vanilla again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really? That genuinely surprises me. I&#8217;d be interested to find out why. Do you prefer a manufacturers skin or just not android at all?</p>
<p>i love android. i have to admit i am getting a bit tired of it&hellip; but there isnt anything else that i could go to without wishing i was back on android. that said&hellip; i am spoiled by roms. namely aokp. the tweaks and customizations the roms bring to the table show you just how much android is lacking.</p>
<p>the same can be said for skins. i love skins. i think they are a necessity in android. without the oems doing new things, rom/kernel devs included, android has nowhere to go.</p>
<p>but i also feel the need to stick nova prime on any and every phone i come across. it doesnt matter if its my phone or a friend/family member. i introduce them to the world of nova. they always enjoy it. but the drawback to that is you lose the skinning features.</p>
<p>i often switch between aokp, and rom&rsquo;d stock touchwiz. and will turn nova on and off depending on how my week goes when using stock tw.</p>
<p>so to wrap up, i love android. i enjoy all of the things that you can do with android. but i like stock android the least due to its lack of everything. i think stock is way over hyped and once the newness wears off&hellip; more and more people will think as i do. the same goes for the nexus. its over-hyped, misunderstood for what it is supposed to be, and you can never get the skinned experience. all you get is the same look and feel over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Nexus phones running vanilla Android are the only one worth using amongst Android phones. Otherwise its much better user experience in Windows Phone 8 and iOS (even though the latter is getting long in the tooth).</p>
<p>My sis in law was given a Nexus One, Nexus S and Galaxy Nexus while she worked at Google at the end of each year. When she finally left, she got a iPhone 5. Go figure.</p>
<p>Who leaves Google, seriously?</p>
<p>Or did she become <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Yahoo or something?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand this idea that a product is only as good as the amount of units it moves? It does not matter to me, hell it is almost a plus, that not many people have them.</p>
<p>It matters if you want a decent selection of accessories.</p>
<p>By &ldquo;do all that great&rdquo; you mean sell well? If so that&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t have the billions in dollars of marketing support that Samsung and others put behind their phones. Doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that they&rsquo;re nice products.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;do all that great&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not heavily marketed or widely available in AT&amp;T/Verizon stores.</p>
<p>Tech people tend to like non-bloated software regardless of OS choice (Android, iOS, webOS, etc).</p>
<p><em>Doesn&rsquo;t sell billions of units? Can&rsquo;t be good.</em></p>
<p>I believe it eventually would. The Nexus brand is slowly becoming <em>the</em> brand to buy, <span class="caps">IMO</span>.</p>
<p>But until then, they need to setup retail stores here in asia, or at least setup a decent distribution system. Even if they make cheap and competent phones, it gets really expensive when they get here.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s supply chain and logistics suck. They need to shore all that up before they can venture in to retail. At this point &ndash; they can&rsquo;t seem to manage even one direct selling channel (Nexus 4 &ndash; supply issues).</p>
<p>Not enough if you are good in engineering these days. Have to be even better in the support functions!</p>
<p>Motorola have been doing all that whilst Google were dreaming up a page ranking algorithm.</p>
<p>When Google&rsquo;s ideas get off drawing board, through R&amp;D &amp; into production via Motorola (or partners like Foxconn etc) then we&rsquo;ll see.<br />
Up until then though they need to do a hell of a lot better at distribution and getting products into more retailers &amp; through more channels.</p>
<p>Chromebox. That&rsquo;s a desktop. Chances are there&rsquo;ll be a few Motorola phones announced at the I/O. And it&rsquo;s likely they are building a better GoogleTV Product but are just waiting until they have it completed before they announce it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chances are there&rsquo;ll be a few Motorola phones announced at the I/O.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a few&hellip;one. The X Phone. Done.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll announce it there.  It would be too blatant of a sign that they&rsquo;re biased in favor of Motorola.</p>
<p>So, never announce another Motorola phone?</p>
<p>What do you mean they need a desktop? They&rsquo;ve had one for almost two years now. Never heard of the Google Chromebox before I take it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Google has no plans and we have nothing to announce.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For now, he thinks.</p>
<p>They want to continue delivering bad customer service for as long as possible.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BfmuVxzYgGQ/TUCQLLukzNI/AAAAAAAAAsI/7aaQ_2bVmfc/s1600/bad-customer-service%2B2.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Darn, I wanted to pick up my Chromebook Pixel&hellip;</p>
<p>You really thought of buying a Chromebook Pixel?</p>
<p>No, not hardly, t&rsquo;was a joke is all</p>
<p>I would buy it if I was rich.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll buy it when they have the fire sale.</p>
<p>Because Google is going to completely lose their shit when this inevitably doesn&rsquo;t sell well. Do you think they thought the pixel would have high demand when they set out to make it?</p>
<p>Google didn&rsquo;t plan to make Pixel as it would get a high demand&hellip;. They made it just to boost the other laptop manufacturers reason to start improving hardware in their laptops.</p>
<p>Today you mostly see 1366&times;768px display on laptop. It is as well most widely used resolution (and those who whine about resolution meaning <span class="caps">PPI</span>/<span class="caps">DPI</span> can go teach again about technology science about resolution, not about &ldquo;artists resolution&rdquo;) in laptops and it is just so terrible.</p>
<p>Even many laptop from late 90&rsquo;s had much better display than today, because display manufacturers were not greedy to make cheap ones on same production lines as TV and there was no brainf*k vision of &ldquo;16:9 is perfect for computers like it is on TV-shows&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If Google can get even few manufacturer to make few models with 3:2, 5:4 and 4:3 display rations with at least 1600&times;1200 or up, then Google has successfully helped markets with Pixel.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not so much the display manufacturers being greedy as it is a race to the bottom. When your goal is to sell a laptop for as little as possible, the screen quality is usually the first to go.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll be like the Nexus Q where all 5 people who pre-ordered it get it for free.</p>
<p>no. me to just want to pickup one see it and put it down and wait for a cheaper one</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;.heard simliar things before.</p>
<p>Think i&rsquo;ll just sit in a corner and cry now.</p>
<p>I thought this was Android-specific&hellip; although I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t make much sense to do sell Chrome OS devices only in a retail store</p>
<p>Consumers are not going to buy Glass by just reading online reviews.</p>
<p>Judging from the number of Fry memes after Josh&rsquo;s review. I&rsquo;m pretty sure they will.</p>
<p>When he said consumers, I don&rsquo;t think he meant a handful of tech nerds on a gadget site. If Google only wants to sell a few, then great. That will probably be a mission accomplished. But if it&rsquo;s gonna take off, they&rsquo;ll have to put it in retail stores. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s Best Buys, Sam&rsquo;s Clubs, or Sunglass Huts, but people will need to see it for themselves before jumping on such an out-there product. Even then, the jury is still out.</p>
<p>Not regular consumers, but the enthusiast minority that do will give the product a lot of public exposure. Retail stores help as well (maybe more, or al least in a different way), but never underestimate the power of the early adopters.</p>
<p>I dont believe him. Google is making more and more hardware. It will be easier to sell if consumers can try them. Especially in a Google controlled environment. Honestly, does anyone think he would say &ldquo;Yea we are totally going to make a store&rdquo; before it was time to announce it?</p>
<p>It would make no sense to open a retail store. Their product isn&rsquo;t the phone, tablet or whatever. And you are not their customer. They &lsquo;sell&rsquo; these things at cost (Screwing OEM&rsquo;s btw) to gather the product they DO sell. So why would you want to go through the trouble and expense of opening retail stores?</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t care if you use a Nexus, a Galaxy, an <span class="caps">HTC</span> or even an iOS device. They want the data, not the headaches. They aren&rsquo;t really happy if you use a Windows phone or tablet though&hellip;</p>
<p>Because diversifying your revenue stream isn&rsquo;t Business 101.</p>
<p>Actually &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t. Conglomerates haven&rsquo;t been management orthodoxy in the west since the 1980s.</p>
<p>If this was 2 yrs ago i would agree with you. Google Glass and the Chromebook Pixel changes everything (Which is one of the reason The Verge is looking to rename the Android forum).  Looking at the future, I dont think Google will only be selling Nexus devices.  Im sure Glass and the Pixel are not being sold at cost. Google is slowly becoming a hardware company.  What better way to sell Glass than from a store.</p>
<p>Shocked that he&rsquo;s not wearing google glass</p>
<p>He already has glasses.</p>
<p>Prescription Google Glass?</p>
<p>He was being interviewed, he didn&rsquo;t want to look like a moron.</p>
<p>Says the person hasn&rsquo;t tried them.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t look moron wearing Google Glass, but you will act like a moron if you try to present your unfinished product of other department when someone is interviewing you from other topics&hellip;</p>
<p>Like I said before, this is a long term and an expensive one at that.  Not saying they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t but it&rsquo;s a hell of a commitment if they do and I don&rsquo;t think they are ready for such a commitment.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much to get right behind the scenes before launching flagship stores, even if they limit them to the likes of LA, NY, London, Paris, Berlin &amp; Tokyo before rolling out to other large cities.</p>
<p>Distribution, recruitment, training, in-store processes &amp; procudures.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll surely start poaching distribution &amp; retail personnel from other companies well, well in advance.</p>
<p>Google makes razor thin margin on its products ( possibly including the pixel) to justify opening stores, where  you need to justify paying staff salaries, rents/leases and other bills. This also explains why we see brick n mortar stores either closing shop or in the case of Best Buy and a few others, who try to match online prices.<br />
In the ling run, The profit margin on Googles products will be a major decider in staying with the google play model or going retail.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For Nexus, I don&rsquo;t think the program is far enough along to think about the necessity of having these things in a retail store.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the lack of a store a factor?</p>
<p>Yes, the Nexus program is really in its infancy but the 4 and 7 (when initially released) had huge hype that could have benefitted from a store front. The Nexus 7 wasn&rsquo;t in stores (at least in my area) until Staples started selling then. The same was true for the 4; T-Mobile didn&rsquo;t get in store units until a few months after release.</p>
<p>Yeah, a Google store might seem odd as of right now but I have no doubt that it will become an absolute necessity within a few months/year.</p>
<p>Still, I think you need maybe 10 or so different products before you open up a store.</p>
<p>Yeah.<br />
Even when filled out with accessories whch are pretty thin on the ground even for the limited product range they couldn&rsquo;t fill half a shop with Nexus 4, 7, 10 &amp; Chromebook Pixel.</p>
<p>That does sort of create the argument that it will be better for Google to keep these devices in production &amp; on sale when their inevitable successors come out this year so having the Nexus 7 on sale alongside the Nexus 7.7 (or whatever) like Apple do with the iPad &amp; iPad 2 and of course the iPhone 5, 4S &amp; 4</p>
<p>but wait &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://media.techeblog.com/images/google_store_4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I buy my bananas and my iPhone from there.  _</p>
<p>That store is still in beta</p>
<p>Rubin has been marginalized at Google for quite a while now. Android was a short term play for them. Chrome and Glass benefit from &ldquo;showroom&rdquo; experience, while Android does fine for itself in a mobile carrier stores. Rubin is the last person at Google I expect would know if they were really going to establish a retail presence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Android was a short term play for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah: I think Google see (or saw) Android as a way to get them into the market, but now Chrome OS is slowly picking up traction, they&rsquo;re pushing forward with Chrome OS a lot more now. Seriously wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we see a Chrome OS phone at some point (Chromephone?), and then Google dumping Android, in the years to come.</p>
<p>i think you forgot the /s.</p>
<p>Android&rsquo;s a mess. Samsung dominate, Google are worried about their Galaxy brand basically meaning Android to most people, the update thing is a mess: they&rsquo;ve got 45% running 2.3 and just over that running 4.&times;.&times;. Plus the fact Android makes them almost no money compared to how much iOS makes Apple. They can&rsquo;t make their own hardware because it might upset the OEMs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chrome OS&rsquo; update schedule is fantastic, it&rsquo;s not directly open-source so Google control it 100%, they can make their own hardware, like they&rsquo;ve done with the Pixel.</p>
<p>Google execs must have realized this, and thought: we can make Chrome as good as Android. Android&rsquo;s a complete mess, and we can&rsquo;t repair it. It makes us almost no money (although making money isn&rsquo;t totally the aim of Android, it must be something they&rsquo;re thinking about). But we have Chrome, and it&rsquo;s doing very nicely, picking up traction, and people love the Pixel&rsquo;s hardware.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t happen for about 5 years, but I seriously think it will. Google have basically lost control of Android.</p>
<p>Riiight, and in doing do they basically return themselves to a minority player and still end up competing with Samsung, just on a lesser platform.  What do they do with Android? Bin it, awesome for all those people with android phones.  Give it to the open source community? Great, now Samsung actually do own it.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think if anything we will see a chrome into android convergence rather than the other way around.</p>

<p>Note: I use Android every single day as my main smartphone and tablet OS. But I much prefer Chrome OS, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure a lot of other people do too.</p>
<p>How interesting to compare and OS for smartphones and tablets to a giant web browser! Your analysis seems really accurate to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How interesting to compare and OS for smartphones and tablets to a giant web browser!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chrome OS isn&rsquo;t a giant web browser&hellip;and anyway, the web is the most powerful thing we have, technology wise. Web apps are really taking off, and once Chrome Packaged Apps is officially announced (they&rsquo;re in the dev channels as we speak), the &lsquo;giant web browser&rsquo;, &rsquo;it&rsquo;s not a real OS&rsquo; accusations will be completely invalid.</p>
<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t see how you can compare two different kinds of OS. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense. What do you expect, a phone app in your Chrome browser on your smartphone ?</p>
<p>Android use Linux operating system<br />
ChromeOS use Linux operating system</p>
<p>Both Android and ChromeOS are different software systems with totally different features and graphical user interface because they are designed to totally different environments and devices.</p>
<p>Google isn&rsquo;t doing anything as stupid as Microsoft by pushing a one graphical user interface for all different devices from small screen handheld to big screen desktop&hellip;. It would be like Apple placing OS X to iPhone 6 and 5th generation of iPad&hellip; It would be catastrophic!</p>
<p>You might like to eat soup with fork&hellip; and some others but most still prefer spoon&hellip;</p>
<p>Check my reply to sideshowscott.</p>
<p>Not sure, but really how long can Google keep doing two completely different operating systems?</p>
<p>Apple has iOS and <span class="caps">OSX</span>. That is no different than this Chrome and Android both use the Linux kernel. The interesting part is the slow merging of ChromeOS and Chrome as the browser.  Not having your Chromebook with you won&rsquo;t keep you from having your Google flavored desktop.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>ChromeOS and Android use Linux operating system. One OS in those two and all Google servers are ran by Linux operating system as well and even their developers can use Linux distribution as Google has own Ubuntu-derived for their workers.</p>
<p>Google use only one OS in all their products&hellip;<br />
Apple use only one OS in all their products&hellip;<br />
Microsoft has now after Windows Phone 8 dropped the CE operating system and switched to single OS (NT) strategy like Apple and Google.</p>
<p>Do not mistake graphical user interface and system programs, libraries, software platforms etc as operating system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple (theoretically, at least, realistically, not so much), allow Android apps to run on Chrome OS, dump Android, <em>voila!</em> Chromephone</p>
<p>I forgot the <strong>/troll</strong> on the end&hellip; my bad</p>
<p>derp?</p>
<p>A few pop-up stores to sell Glass could be what they want to do, and would still allow for Rubin to plausibly deny the opening of a full-on retail chain.</p>
<p>Well if Mr Andy &ldquo;Your Phone Should Not Be Your Assistant&rdquo; Rubin says they aren&rsquo;t opening stores, I&rsquo;m now 100% sure that they are going to do so &ndash; and probably in less than a year.</p>
<p>Who can blame google.they would just need to rise their google play gift card from 50 to a higher limit covering their product sold at play if they want more sale.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d also need to actually allow the purchase of devices with gift cards.</p>
<p>Not going to happen, gift cards always carry a high comission.</p>
<p>Sounds like an Apple statement, such as &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll never make a seven inch tablet.&rdquo; Of course they&rsquo;re going to make retail stores, it&rsquo;s a given with the amount of quality products they have/are planning nowadays.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t make a 7 inch tablet, they made an ~8 inch table.</p>
<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t have legs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the catch, <strong>you</strong> are the legs.</p>
<p>Why so surprised? Rubin doesn&rsquo;t think you need tablet apps either.</p>
<p>Who cares what he thinks, developers will defy him if they see fit.</p>
<p>This is completely out of context.  The fact that one well designed app using the fragment system would serve both phones and tablets would imply you don&rsquo;t need a separate tablet app. It wasn&rsquo;t a difficult concept to grasp.</p>
<p>Rubin, You just crushed my dreams&hellip;</p>
<p>This is one of the softest &lsquo;no plans&rsquo; statements I&rsquo;ve seen in a while.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s happening.</p>
<p>This deeply saddens me. I was looking forward to applying to work at a Google retail store&hellip;.. <br /><span class="caps">DAMN</span> IT <span class="caps">ANDY</span>!!!</p>
<p>Eric Schmidt said Google wouldn&rsquo;t make a phone either.</p>
<p>Technically,  they haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>ergh</p>
<p>Retail front is not needed for simpler non-high-price items like phones and tablets since we&rsquo;re not douche bags that can&rsquo;t handle for than a home button but for things like Chrome Pixel, Google Shades, Google Autonomous Car, etc. it&rsquo;s beneficial.  As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;d like to see a package deal where I buy a Google Autonomous Car and get all the other items included.</p>
<p>As usual, you don&#8217;t make sense. Pls stop trolling and go back to Engadget where you belong.</p>
<p>He is from Quebec, give him a break.</p>
<p>You have a short fuse.. He&rsquo;s just saying that a store would be more beneficial for high-priced items</p>
<p>Lies.</p>
<p>Why on earth wouldn&rsquo;t they? Stupid move.</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip; Google actually has actually nothing to offer in stores. <br />
And I would same thing for Microsoft, nothing to sell</p>
<p>Surface RT and Surface Pro are such products what should not be reason to build a store. Microsoft on peripherals are neither such products.</p>
<p>Word of Mouth? HA! Word of mouth is not a strategy, but good luck w/ that.</p>
<p>ehhh, f&rsquo;ing <span class="caps">LAME</span>??? google is losing a <span class="caps">HUUUGE</span> opportunity here, just like how they are not making an android book and sticking with the lame useless chrome os. ugh. google is so stupid sometimes.</p>
<p>Where am I gonna get my android key chain now? Damn you Google</p>
<p>Is the full roundtable discussion available?</p>
<p>Perhaps Motorola is positioned to become the Nexus brand?</p>
<p>I like Nexus as a brand. Motorola has history as a company and I&rsquo;m sure the brand has value as a consumer facing commodity&hellip; but I&rsquo;m not sure what that value is and if the positives offset the negatives as far as it&rsquo;s concerned.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><img title="" src="http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Michael-scott-no-god-no.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t even properly handle selling the few physical items off their Google Play Store&hellip; if Google (of all companies) can&rsquo;t handle selling stuff online, i don&rsquo;t see how they could possibly do brick-and-mortar.</p>
<p>Andy Rubin says that Google doesn&rsquo;t plan to sell many Chrome Pixels, or Google Nexus devices. It;s not really their core business (ha ha).</p>
<p>Take that, World&hellip;</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t&hellip; Google only manufactures products to be as direction sign for other manufacturers and customers.<br />
They do it with all their products. Example of Google Chrome, they didn&rsquo;t plan to take #1 position in web browsers but to push W3C standards forward and that is what they did. They don&rsquo;t care so much about their browser itself.<br />
With Android they don&rsquo;t care it so much but that they can push features for other to follow. <br />
Will Google release a car to mass production? No&hellip; they will sell the technology and designs to others.</p>
<p>If you want markets to improve and help people, you can not go and start competition but you need to help others and show them your vision. And if market movement has stopped, you need to show your different design and get it to be vision for new direction.</p>
<p>Didnt they say that the Chromebook Pixel was fake and then they announced it a couple of weeks later?</p>
<p>give me the X Phone!</p>
<p>Yeah, Google cannot even keep orders for the Nexus 4 straight. Remember the &ldquo;refreshing the cart&rdquo; marathon that many were doing for hours? Google is dependent on OEMs to actually make the hardware, so there are things that is out of their control. Having a retail store is going to make things a lot more complicated for inventory, let alone staffing, etc. Google has zero experience in that.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, it would be great if Google decided to have a retail stores selling unlocked Android phones form the various OEMs. Samsung, <span class="caps">HTC</span>, LG, Motorola, all the OEMs except for Sony refuse to sell unlocked phones in the US, and only sell their stuff through carriers. If Google can be the gateway to sell the unlocked version of Samsung Galaxy S x, or the latest <span class="caps">HTC</span> #, I&rsquo;m all for that. People that love carrier controlled phones can still buy their stuff from their lovely carriers, but others will have the option to go unlocked. Right now, there&rsquo;s no option, unless you buy Nexus/Sony or want to import and pay $$$ for a device without warranty.</p>
<p>Told you so.</p>
<p>Physical stores belong to the past. Google is the future.</p>
<p>Cools stuff. When is Smart Glass coming to the market?</p>
<p>SmartGlass is already on the market in W8. But some of the more advanced features are not coming until the Fall Update on the 360.</p>
<p>The iPad app also got an update with some of the smaller features.</p>
<p>For the full mounty get a W8 tablet&#8230;</p>
<p>The features will be the same regardless of platform. SmartGlass works anywhere its available, where as W8 tablets only have access to Xbox LIVE as an actual gaming platform as an advantage.</p>

<p>look at ross go!</p>
<p>So each SmartGlass app (for games) is going to be separate then?  IE, I&#8217;ll have to download and install this Dance Central 3 app from the Windows Store to use it?  Or will it automatically be loaded within the current SmartGlass app?  I had assumed the latter but this kind of makes it sound like they&#8217;ll all be separate.</p>
<p>Considering the app is nothing more than an HTML file, it would be a pretty big fail if you have to download a separate app for each game. I always pictured the SmartGlass interface being streamed down to the main SmartGlass app whenever your Xbox happens to be playing that game, but there isn&#8217;t really any evidence one way or the other in this video.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I thought as well.  Just the way the article talks about &#8220;when it will come out&#8221; being up in the air makes it seem like that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming that when you connect with the Smartglass app, it&#8217;ll bring down a unique HTML5 app for the relevant game. (as I said it&#8217;s an assumption but it would be absurd to make a bespoke app for every game so this a logical assumption)</p>
<p>one app.<br />
Fall update beta testers can sort-of test it out w/ a WP7 device w/ the Companion app.  Limited and pointless right now of course&#8230; but works.</p>
<p>Yes, you can test out the SmartGlass app on Windows 8 too, but since nobody has Dance Central 3 yet, none of us know that for certain.</p>
<p>As I already said above, I also assume that it will be included in one app and streamed directly to the tablet when you play a compatible game, but the way that the article talks about being unsure about how and when it&#8217;ll be distributed makes it sound like that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>is that a surface tablet?</p>
<p>That Colbert-esque stare down at the end was perfect</p>
<p>For Kinect games, Smartglass makes a TON of sense.</p>
<p>Nothing is more tedious to me than trying to play one sport in Kinect Sports.<br />
I watched my best friend&#8217;s kid nearly give up in frustration becasue he was having the hardest time getting past the menus in Sonic Free Riders.</p>
<p>Still enjoy Kinect tremendously, none of the above it to hate on it&#8230; but some of the menus for some games are an A-1 royal pain in the nutsack.</p>
<p>Agree wholeheartedly. I was skeptical of Smartglass, and expected it to be implemented in a contrived way. But this looks like a logical use of the tech. Smartglass complements Kinect games well. Dance Central has one of the best Kinect interfaces (Ubisoft with Your Shape 2012 is my favourite), but it isn&#8217;t perfect.</p>
<p>Well he&#8217;s definately dressed for the new hipster tech geek portion of the &#8220;demo&#8221;. Headline also skates the line for click baiting, as I sort of expected the video to show it &#8220;in action&#8221;. Nicely done, I clicked. :)</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure</em></p>
<p><em>Didn&rsquo;t actually buy this. Modified my Nexus 4 receipt and took a SS.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually waiting on the next version of the pixel which will hopefully be <span class="caps">ARM</span> based and less expensive. Until then I will use my Series 3 Chromebook which gets an hour and a half more battery and suits my needs for something on the go (I even do a bit of programming on it thanks to Cloud9)</p>
<p>how do we know this is not <span class="caps">ARM</span> i cant see any tech specs except for pixelzz</p>
<p>edit: ok now i see it.</p>

<p>Bottom of the page. It uses an i5 1.8ghz and the HD4000 <span class="caps">GPU</span></p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s just a storage bump away from being a <em>real</em> computer!</p>
<p>Well, storage and a full OS. That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t get. The elements of a computing device are a like a chain. One broken link and the whole thing is suddenly diminished. In this case, an OS that is essentially a web-browser. I genuinely just don&rsquo;t get this. Even cut down OS&rsquo;s like iOS beat this and a full OS like Ubutnu, Windows or <span class="caps">OSX</span> are so much more useful, it&rsquo;s hard to see why you wouldn&rsquo;t go for one of them. If it were a low-end <span class="caps">ARM</span> device, I could kind of see it, but apparently this has an i5 in it! So why have that one broken link in the chain? Serviceable processing power, good quality screen and a web-browser. At the price point of a quality laptop. Even if you are really (and I mean really) mad keen on battery life and basically just interested in web-browsing&hellip; even then I&rsquo;d be hard pushed to see why you&rsquo;d get this over an iPad or a SurfaceRT. A nice screen is wasted on this, surely? I genuinely just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Thing is for that price that for that price you could get the surface pro which is better in so many ways.</p>
<p>Looks like Google decided to copy the Macbook Pro with 13-inch Retina Display but <strong>cripple</strong> it by removing features like hard-drive storage and sell it at a higher price.</p>
<p>You know Google has a hit product on their hands when people only pretend to buy the machine out of fear of being shamed for throwing money away.</p>
<p>My god &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t tell from the pixels :(</p>
<p>You just upset Larry and Sergey, they thought they actually had an order!</p>
<p>you get a cookie today!</p>
<p>And we still don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Thank God! Money wasn&rsquo;t wasted.</p>

<p>Surface Pro? I heard it&rsquo;s excellent at installing Chrome.</p>
<p>The key word there is &lsquo;Installing&rsquo;. Surface can install &lsquo;programs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is ok at Engadget, but we don&rsquo;t allow meme misuse here.</p>

<p>Who elected you as Verge spokesperson? Even if the meme was used incorrectly, it was awfully funny.</p>
<p>Hell, I laughed.</p>
<p>People buy mac book pros that cost even more just to browse Facebook, so whats the problem with this?</p>

<p>People buy mac book pros that cost even more just to browse Facebook, so whats the problem with this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People that buy Macbook Pros to simply browse Facebook are still <em>idiots</em></p>
<p>People that buy a laptop above $1000 to simply browse Facebook are still <em>idiots</em></p>
<p>&hellip;However&hellip;</p>
<p>The person that bought a Macbook Pro vs. this Google Pixel has a much more capable OS to take advantage of in due time. In addition, Macbook Pros hold their value. I&rsquo;m not saying this won&rsquo;t, but it has not been proven to do so.</p>
<p>I just think its agreeable that this Google Pixel is risky at that price.</p>
<p>What did google essentially do here? What <span class="caps">NOKIA</span> did for <span class="caps">YEARS</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">SYMBIAN</span>&hellip;They kept putting top of the line hardware on a very outdated mobile OS.<br />
I&rsquo;m not saying the chrome OS is outdated, it&rsquo;s just far inferior than Mac and Windows&hellip;just as symbian was to iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Google needs to improve the chromebook experience first, then come out with a premium device to match the premium OS.</p>
<p>Halo products tend to hold their value relatively well. For example, Thinkpad X300&rsquo;s and Sony Z&rsquo;s are all well above what I would consider a reasonable price for a used laptop with those specs. There&rsquo;s a bit of collector&rsquo;s item charm to them.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t top of the line hardware. The reviews on the 13" <span class="caps">MBP</span> Retina with i4000HD gfx said the chipset couldn&rsquo;t really handle the res. So this has a few more pixels, it is going to be more sluggish. It has an average <span class="caps">CPU</span> at best. USB2, not USB3 &ndash; people wailed and spat at Apple until they went USB3</p>
<p>In <span class="caps">CPU</span>/<span class="caps">GPU</span> it is a year old pedestrian tech, underpowered for the job. In I/O it is 3 years old.</p>
<p>Claim to fame? A third mic to knock out keyboard clicks&hellip;</p>
<p>This thing is <span class="caps">WAY</span> over priced.</p>
<p><span class="caps">KIRF</span> much?</p>
<p>I love it when people say Symbian is outdated.. the UX was outdated, the kernel itself is one of the newest ones out there.. and it has a very &ldquo;modern&rdquo; approach. Here, reading is bueno:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1578523" target="_blank">http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1578523</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Symbian is about the closest of any modern system to how I would design a kernel if I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about legacy support (and had the time to design a kernel).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some people might. Most people who buy a MacBook Pro do so because they want to do a lot more. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to produce a product targeted solely at people who don&rsquo;t understand technical specifications.</p>
<p>You should see a problem with both scenarios there.</p>
<p>Because those <span class="caps">MBP</span> can actually do more. This is a <span class="caps">MBP</span> that will never allow you to do anything than browse the web.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge difference between say, someone who buys a Ferrari California or a Lamborghini Aventador and only drives it on the street (no track usage) and someone who buys either of the same cars where gears 2-7 have been locked out in the transmission so it has a max speed of 40 mph.</p>
<p>Hey this makes a macbook pro looks like a bargain!</p>
<p>I <span class="caps">COULD</span> buy a f1 Formula Car to drive back and forth to work, doesn&rsquo;t mean its a smart thing to do.</p>
<p>The difference is, the Pixel is like buying a sports car that can <span class="caps">ONLY</span> drive you to work. It can&rsquo;t go on the speedway, you can&rsquo;t take it out and race it, just 55 all the way back and forth to work.</p>
<p>One is choice, the other isn&rsquo;t. :)</p>
<p>*Paid&hellip;.</p>
<p>Dammit verge, let me <span class="caps">EDIT</span>!! haha</p>
<p>These comments remind me of the iPad &ldquo;Just a large iPod&rdquo; comments, to which I participated in, much to my dismay.</p>
<p>I refuse to take part. Maybe in 6 months&hellip;</p>
<p>Difference being the iPad was a new form factor in a brand new market, priced very competitively. This is a dumbed down ultrabook with Surface Pro battery life, costing hundreds of dollars more.</p>
<p>iPad was something new, innovative, different than what the masses have seen. This, this, is another &ldquo;me to&rdquo; product albeit Google&rsquo;s take on it. Nothing new or innovative except for perhaps the screen (which you may be seeing on other devices later this year). So, please don&rsquo;t try and compare this to the iPad debut.</p>

<p><span class="caps">ROFL</span>, you win.</p>
<p>Plus he lives in OR &hellip; not the best place for hydroponics &hellip;</p>
<p>Wow!</p>
<p>I guess it&rsquo;s worth it with the 1TB of storage.</p>
<p>until you have to start paying 50 bucks a month to retain the storage space they have you used to using.</p>
<p>In three years it will be much cheaper&hellip;</p>
<p>And I bet in two years it will be much cheaper, hell, one year. But guess what? You&rsquo;re locked in because you bought a crappy laptop and three year subscription.</p>
<p>You can hardly say this is crappy, dude. The OS is getting more fully featured every day and the hardware is supposed to be excellent.</p>
<p>It might be getting more new features, but it&rsquo;s starting from a long way back. And really, it doesn&rsquo;t need to merely slowly gain the same features as other OSs, it needs to do something extra, too. Which it almost intrinsically can&rsquo;t as it&rsquo;s a browser that can run within the other OSs already.</p>
<p>no&hellip; not really.. especially for 1.3 grand.</p>
<p>Um&hellip; I can buy a retina 13" MacBook Pro for $1,499. You know, one with a beautiful display and a the ability to run Mac OS X <span class="caps">AND</span> Windows.</p>
<p>Just like with phones, it&rsquo;s about <span class="caps">ECOSYSTEM</span>.  Chrome extensions != Mac App Store.</p>
<p>I think the price is silly too, but I&rsquo;m confident Google have a master plan that involves a much cheaper, longer battery life, <span class="caps">ARM</span> version of the Pixel. You cannot say the Pixel is a crappy laptop. Hardware wise, it&rsquo;s on par with a MacBook Pro. Software wise, Chrome is still quite a way back, but it&rsquo;s improved hugely on where it was just a year ago. With Chrome Packaged Apps, Google are making Chrome OS into a proper, web based OS.</p>

<p>The amount of storage and <span class="caps">RAM</span> are pretty low, actually the lowest amount of flash storage we&rsquo;ve ever seen on a high end laptop.</p>
<p>Also judging from the viewing angle, it&rsquo;s not even a <span class="caps">IPS</span> display which also a part of the hardware.</p>
<p>Storage doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s a Chromebook. Everything lives in the cloud.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RAM</span>: meh, 4gb is enough on a Chromebook for the time being.</p>
<p>Screen: <span class="caps">IPS</span> would be nice. Maybe they&rsquo;ll update it at I/O or something.</p>
<p>or get a new chromebook</p>
<p>Just did the math on the 1 TB / 3 years (1TB/month @ 49.99/month) it would add up to 1799.64 I would say paying 1449.99 for this Chromebook and getting all of that ^^ for &ldquo;free&rdquo; is worth it.</p>
<p>As long as cloud storage stays so ridiculously expensive for three years.</p>
<p>You are a brave, brave soul. With some extra cash. Do let us know how it is!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that you accidentally purchased that when you were trying to buy a Nexus 4.</p>
<p>Already have a nexus 4.</p>
<p>Holy crap, did you buy a Nexus Q as well?</p>
<p>If so, you may want to visit the doctor and make sure your meds are the right strength.</p>
<p>Nexus Q was the best buy ever. Everyone who placed an order got it for free&hellip;</p>
<p>Really? Everyone got a refund?</p>
<p>Oh, no. They just ended up promising some other hardware in the future, even if its not what they actually wanted.</p>
<p>No, Google never charged them, they just got nexus q shipped to them for free. But who knew?</p>
<p>So one pays 1400+ for the device and still does not get free shipping.</p>
<p>Google. Is. Evil. :D</p>
<p>not even cheap shipping, but infomercial level rape shipping</p>
<p>I could kind of understand it for the Nexus 4 since the profit margin is razor thin, but this thing has got to be 80% profit.</p>
<p>A regular chromebook is $200. You paid $1100+ more for the added benefit of a touchscreen, with web apps that aren&rsquo;t optimized for touchscreens. That said without early adopters like you devices wouldn&rsquo;t be available for the rest of the populous at lower prices when 2nd gen comes out.</p>
<p>yeah, I guess we need this guy.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m still baffled though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually jealous, i really want this device but it&rsquo;s so much money.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually buy it if you see my above post.</p>
<p>Buy the series 3 chromebook though. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
<p>I have one already, this is the problem.</p>
<p>Yeah, and you can&rsquo;t even install Adobe CS6 and that&rsquo;s a huge part of my job!</p>
<p>but why?</p>
<p><img title="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1pvT2bYfVmo/USamp1MY06I/AAAAAAAAUog/3wanIrne-e8/s836/Tim-Cook-laughing.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>christ I paid less than that for a 15" <span class="caps">MBP</span> a few years ago</p>
<p>I would have rather bought all 3 nexus devices instead&hellip; but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>The men in white coats will be at your door shortly&hellip;</p>
<p>the only thing stopping me from buying it right now is the price</p>
<p>Sorry but what kills it is the &ldquo;Up to 5 hours&rdquo; of battery life. a 1,400$ web browser that nails browsing is acceptable&hellip;. but when you can get a Dell <span class="caps">XPS</span> 12, that is a full computer, tablet, 1080p screen and same battery life for the same price&hellip;. that <span class="caps">REALLY</span> sucks&hellip;</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a Dell. Puts a huge number right off.</p>
<p>Not especially.</p>
<p>and the only web apps, and the yearly fee for cloud after 3 years, and the apps that do not support chromebook display, and the no desktop app, and the no turnable functionality or the tablety function.</p>
<p>3:2 screen ratio? Apple will sued it</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d buy it.</p>
<p>&hellip;But you&rsquo;re <span class="caps">NOT</span> going to buy it&hellip; So what does your comment even mean?</p>

<p>Makes the mind wonder if Google didn&rsquo;t really make this for consumers so much, as they did for their own employees who want a premium laptop w/ Chrome OS.</p>
<p>then why go to the trouble and expense of producing significant enough quantities and making it available for purchase?</p>
<p>to sell for an exorbitant amount of cash to subsidize the cost of giving it to their employees for free.</p>
<p>Why would anyone who actually does real work want a computer with only a web browser on it?</p>
<p>I mean, you probably could get away with it, but it&rsquo;s certainly hobbled.</p>
<p>Google Boggles.</p>
<p>In your Chromebook?</p>
<p>Not at that price!</p>
<p>I love Chrome OS and I love my Series 3 Chromebook to death, but you&rsquo;re right that this price is a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>Same, i love premium materials and all, but $1,300 for a &ldquo;facebook&rdquo; machine is out of the question, ok you can hack it and install a real OS like ubuntu, but at that price point it gets only 32GB of storage, that&rsquo;s insane, any Ultrabook at that price point have a 128gb or 256gb <span class="caps">SSD</span>.</p>
<p>I can only think that the 1tb of cloud storage is intended to really appeal to photographers (are they already on google?  Did they do market research for a niche pro market?), so this really is a niche machine, like the regular near-disposable chromebooks for education.  It&rsquo;s still kind of bonkers, because why touchscreen then?  Why not have a cheaper device to spread touch first?</p>
<p>Any professional photographer is not going to want to trust their photos with the cloud. And pro photographers want tools like Photoshop and Lightroom, not Chrome web apps.</p>
<p>best chrome picture edit app is pixlr editor which is like <span class="caps">GIMP</span> and is a real app. there are countless audio editing apps and web apps. i just think there is more on the horizon. i would say take my money but i don&rsquo;t have any money&hellip;.</p>
<p>And this from someone whose name is microsoftmissionary.</p>
<p>i have no money but want a beautiful laptop what is wrong with that?</p>
<p>Why not buy a proper laptop from Apple (install Windows if you must) or one of the Microsoft OEMs?</p>
<p>because i like Chrome OS and the high res screen and the coolness of the design and the free terabyte of storage</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Please familiarize yourself with the basics of Sales Techniques. The 1TB of storage is not &ldquo;free&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But hey, if you like it, buy it.</p>
<p>i know. it is &ldquo;free&rdquo; for 3 years. but hey nothing is free right?</p>
<p>Except it isn&rsquo;t free is it? You are paying $1300 for basically a web browser with 1 terabyte of cloud storage.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s &lsquo;master plan&rsquo;, if you can call it that, is to tie everyone into their eco system by tempting them with the 1 TB storage for 3 years. Trouble is who is going to pay that amount of money for a web browser?</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing, just pointing out the disconnect.</p>
<p>Sorry but those are not the equivalent of PS and Lightroom.  You also need the local storage as well as remote storage.  1TB isn&rsquo;t really all that much when dealing with high resolution photography as well.</p>
<p>As for audio apps.  You are not going to be able to record to that thing with that little bit of space.  Not to mention the requirements regarding local latency and midi support for audio.</p>
<p>a terabyte is not that much???? cmon man. i mean if you are a professional person different story but for an amateur like me big difference. i know <span class="caps">GIMP</span> Paint.<span class="caps">NET</span> or pixlr are nothing to lightroom, PS, or whatever corel has but it is good for the average user.</p>
<p>I am an amateur/hobbyist photographer.  My library of photos is currently at 750GB.  That doesn&rsquo;t include the 1.5TB of archived stuff either.    I have single image files that are nearly 100MB each.</p>
<p>You responded to someone mentioning pro level photogs you never mentioned amateur or hobbyist level photography or editing for that matter.  If you want to move the goalposts fine but in the context of this thread it does not make sense to use.</p>
<p>do u shoot in <span class="caps">RAW</span>? how big are the photos? just purely wondering.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m an amateur photographer shooting in raw+jpeg. even with discipline deleting unworthy photos, the last year&rsquo;s shoots have taken over 1TB of space already. on top of that, i&rsquo;m also a pro designer. i have 2TB on my laptop and 4TB external <span class="caps">HDD</span>. i&rsquo;m struggling just to keep my laptop from filling up the remaining 750gb.</p>
<p>i find no use for a $1300 1TB online storage. you&rsquo;re far better off buying 1TB usb 3 drive for $100+.</p>
<p>You also get the benefit of being able to get to your photos without having an internet connection (important of your on a plane or on holiday or something).</p>
<p>Raw+jpeg.  I have another 2tb on some old drives that are offline.  It adds up which is why for anyone serious about photography 1TB is nothing.</p>
<p>i see your point. see i don&rsquo;t nearly fill that much nowhere near because i don&rsquo;t shoot in <span class="caps">RAW</span> so i see exactly your point.</p>
<p>Yeah if you are serious at a hobby or higher level it breaks down.  The specs aim it at students but what you get for the price seems weak imho.</p>
<p>But 1TB in the Cloud is not where you&rsquo;d normally want to be working from. I don&rsquo;t get the use case for this. If you&rsquo;re out and about using public WiFi or your own paid mobile data plan, you&rsquo;re not going to want to be shuffling large quantities of photos or video about. And if you&rsquo;re at home, then you can use a full PC, even if it&rsquo;s a laptop or hybrid, in preference to this. It doesn&rsquo;t even have great battery life.</p>
<p>Anything more than $300 for a Chromebook is idiotic, and calling Chrome an OS is just as idiotic. It&rsquo;s a web browser. Nothing more.</p>
<p>They need to kill chrome and make a Desktop version of Android.. Apple and Google need to take notes from MS on this one..</p>
<p>For $100 bucks more I could buy a 13" retina <span class="caps">MBP</span>. I don&rsquo;t see how anyone could think this is a viable price point for a Chromebook.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s a halo device.</p>
<p>Hardly. Unless by halo you mean it will be wearing one because it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">DOA</span>.</p>
<p>You keep using that word &ndash; I do not think it means what you think it means.</p>
<p>I suppose instead of being snarky I could explain why it isn&rsquo;t a halo device.</p>
<p>A halo product is usually an affordable, entry level device that consumers have a good experience with, leading to the future purchase of a brand&rsquo;s more expensive devices/higher end devices.</p>
<p>This is not affordable. It isn&rsquo;t entry level. Nobody who spends $1,299 on this is going to be swayed to buy another Google branded device. They&rsquo;ll spend $1,299 on it for one of two reasons: they&rsquo;ve had previouse good experiences with a former, less expensive Chromebook (like the original preview Chrombook I was sent a couple years ago); or they are making an association between Android and Chrome because of Google. Either way, it doesn&rsquo;t justify the price of the machine to an average user.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re confusing &ldquo;halo&rdquo; with &ldquo;dunce cap&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google is not stupid. They sold Nexus 4, 7 and 10 with almost no profit margins. They know this will not sell well and I guess they won&rsquo;t manufacture many of them. They are trying to make a statement&hellip; But I am not sure what it is</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have so much money that we can afford to do stupid things like this&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no idea what we&rsquo;re doing&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well to some extent that is what MS are doing with the Surface. They&rsquo;re not subsidizing it / selling it at cost like Google are with the Chromebooks, they&rsquo;re profit-making products. But they&rsquo;re also putting them out there as a pace-setter for OEMs to raise the game. But no <span class="caps">OEM</span> is going to compete with this device &ndash; there&rsquo;s little profit to be had. If this is Googles intent, then the pacesetter has run off into the distance and left the rest behind. Which isn&rsquo;t a good thing when you only make money from the rest, not the pace-setter.</p>
<p>Thinking about this device a bit more, I honestly can&rsquo;t believe that they&rsquo;ve made more than a handful of these just so that they can use the product for marketing or as the most wildly optimistic testing of market waters imaginable.</p>
<p>I think Google have been caught a bit wrong-footed recently. I think they misjudged how strongly their rivals could move when woken.</p>
<p>Interesting comparison drawn there &ndash; while Surface was supposed to spur on innovation, this is just Google providing a high-end option if anyone wants it. Only problem: the hardware and software aren&rsquo;t really great. Chromebooks have a real opportunity to capture the low end of the traditional laptop market as Windows tries to push into more expensive and complex hardware, but this device would have to be well under $1000 to make sense to me.</p>
<p>hardware seems pretty damn good to me (aside from the storage). It&rsquo;s the limited software that kills it to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know. The 3:2 aspect ratio, 32GB <span class="caps">SSD</span>, and thickness compared to the Air all kill it for me hardware wise.</p>
<p>put Windows 8 on it and i&rsquo;m in</p>
<p>You will be able to install Ubuntu or any other <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux OS</p>
<p>I would consider it if it can be Hackintosh&rsquo;d, merely because it would be awesome.</p>
<p>I thought the point of a Hackintosh was to get a Mac without paying the price?</p>
<p>Well with the chromebook pixel you can spend the same amount and get a stupid aspect ratio and tons of other downgrades&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually kinda jealous of the crazy aspect ratio.</p>
<p>Sounds like he wants to put Windows 8 on it.</p>
<p>Does <span class="caps">HURD</span> already work? :D</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s <span class="caps">GNU</span>/<span class="caps">HURD</span> to you, mister.</p>
<p>With a 32Gb hard drive, it will hardly fit Windows, and will be useless for Ubuntu as well.</p>
<p>The surface version of Windows 8 + Apps wouldn&rsquo;t fit on the 32GB would it?</p>
<p>It would. It takes about ~16GB without partition.</p>
<p>Also, you&rsquo;d have to try to to upgrade the hard drive in the Chromebook, which will probably be a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>It actually will if they take out the Backup image and trial version of  Office .. you should have at least 10gb left</p>
<p>Yes it would, it&rsquo;s called the Surface RT&hellip;</p>
<p>WIndows RT uses less space than Windows 8.</p>
<p>And it does even less, too!</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be</p>
<p>And yet with native apps, the Surface RT does more than this Chromebook.</p>
<p>Chromebook has native apps, including native office apps announced.</p>
<p>WinRT has those shipped.</p>
<p>Plus actual MS Office, rather than &ldquo;office apps&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yeah, very, very few web apps, most of which suck. Google&rsquo;s office apps also suck.</p>
<p>But this isn&rsquo;t <span class="caps">ARM</span>-based 0_o</p>
<p>Windows RT doesn&#8217;t run on x86, only <span class="caps">ARM</span>.</p>
<p>LMFAO. You&rsquo;re serious right?</p>
<p>yup.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t he be</p>
<p>Well because for this sort of money, you could get better hardware to run Windows 8 on.</p>
<p>With this kind of money, I would rather get a Surface Pro + Touch Cover. A bit less battery life, a lot more functionality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>put Windows 8 on it and i&rsquo;m in</p>

<p>No, but seriously&hellip;</p>
<p>remote desktop</p>
<p>Looks like those Powerbooks before the Air.</p>
<p>I still have a Powerbook G4, I love it (like a broken kernel-panicy friend). The design isn&rsquo;t the flaw here.</p>
<p>That looks to much like an Apple machine.</p>

<p>1299,- US$ for a Laptop that runs web apps only</p>
<p>Love that movie to tears. That would be Robin&rsquo;s reaction to this Chromebook.</p>
<p>let me rephrase that:</p>
<p><strong>1299,- US$ for a browser with a keyboard</strong></p>
<p>a very, very fat browser.</p>
<p>fast*</p>
<p>No, I think he meant fat.  Considering google is throwing every s*** possible on that thing.</p>
<p>Fat = as the browser is the OS.</p>
<p>Fast = as the browser is the OS.</p>
<p>See, that&rsquo;s works too.</p>
<p>nope.</p>
<p>You mean, it won&rsquo;t be fast?</p>
<p>The browser will fly &ndash; there is nothing else to it.</p>
<p>Yes. It is a fast, $1,300 browser. They don&rsquo;t give it away for free or anything.</p>
<p>Product of they year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really not sure what they were thinking.</p>
<p>Maybe Chrome OS will grow up very soon?</p>
<p>Well, at least the trackpads on chromebooks work.</p>
<p>It IS a ridiculous price, even if it&rsquo;s full of screen.  I don&rsquo;t know about those google guys and their product strategy.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/TaTdV.gif?news" alt="" /></p>
<p>At that price, I&rsquo;ll take a macbook or Win8 ultrabook.  Thanks</p>
<p>Or a Haswell hybrid ala North Cape..</p>
<p>Dude, this makes the $999 price point of a 128GB Surface Pro look amazing in comparison.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s really the most idiotic is that the web isn&rsquo;t retina. No where near it. You&rsquo;ve just paid an obscene amount of money for a screen that will show content that will never be designed for it (at least with the Retina MacBook Pro, OS X apps support it)</p>
<p>Between vector graphics becoming far more common and the html spec moving towards a spec for dynamically sizing img tags, it&rsquo;s getting closer though. That still doesn&rsquo;t justify this.</p>
<p>blahblahblah so its ready in 5 years&hellip;</p>
<p>Too bad WebKit&rsquo;s support for SVG&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t that great, especially compared to IE10.</p>
<p>Vector graphics aren&rsquo;t that great on the web yet. Unless you&rsquo;re drawing everything with vendor-specific tags in <span class="caps">CSS</span>, which is a pain.</p>
<p>The web isn&rsquo;t retina?  Seriously?</p>
<p>Very few websites provide high-resolution image assets that would make a Hi <span class="caps">DPI</span> display actually look good. For apps, it&rsquo;s great though.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s more than you would think.  It really sticks out when you use a retina device as your primary display.  Also, most of what people look at is <span class="caps">TEXT</span> anyway, which looks amazing.</p>
<p>Shhh, he&rsquo;s on a troll.  Let him believe only Apple has a use for high res and not the rest of the world/Internet.</p>
<p>Not true at all. In fact, serving both hi-dpi and low-dpi images has been a major concern and development since 2009-2010 when smartphone usage really stepped up. The frameworks and techniques were developed for serving low res photos for smartphones to lower bandwidth usage and higher res photos for desktops/laptops off the cell networks. The way you did this involves detecting what resolution the user is using, so it by design worked without modification when the tablet craze hit too. The New York Times website does this basically everywhere it uses photos and they did a big write up on how they did it a few years back. The &ldquo;retina&rdquo; or hi-dpi display craze hit even later and all the work was already in place. All you do is literally copy paste a few lines and add a higher resolution photo and higher resolution cut off in your code. You can grep it in a few minutes.<br />
Most sites with mobile layouts use this technique. A lot of sites have mobile layouts and a lot of sites use this technique. <br />
So basically you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Stop it.</p>
<p>Google &ldquo;Responsive web design.&rdquo;<br />
source: used to be a web developer and first heard about this technique a few summers back</p>
<p>If you stand on a street corner holding a piece of cardboard that says &ldquo;The web isn&rsquo;t retina&rdquo; people will give you money.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HOLY</span> <span class="caps">CRAP</span> I AM <span class="caps">DOING</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span> <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> <span class="caps">AWAY</span>!</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<span class="caps">BTW</span>, this thread is full-speed-ahead win&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Also, the number one utility for hi-<span class="caps">DPI</span> monitors are professional software such as Photoshop. There just aren&rsquo;t true equivalents of those on the web. So, what does one do with this, watch 1080p videos on YouTube all day?</p>
<p>The hope is that we can get everyone&rsquo;s screen up to the point that we force the web to get to a higher resolution.</p>
<p>The retina macbook pro is only $1499&hellip;. Google managed to make it look incredible with how much extra you get for another $200.</p>
<p>Something has to push the web towards high-res (or as Apple would say, retina). Looks like it&#8217;ll be this and the rMBP&#8217;s.</p>
<p>No, just the latter one (the MBPs). There&rsquo;s no way that this will sell in numbers remotely high enough to put pressure on web-development practices.</p>
<p>Not the iPad?</p>
<p>Agree with the first part of your comment completely, but I&rsquo;ve been using a rMBP since December and have been pleasantly surprised. There are definitely things that aren&rsquo;t crystal clear, but every thing else looks so good it makes up for that 3 times over.</p>
<p>Right now Microsoft must be saying: &#8220;<span class="caps">HAH</span>!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>exactly&hellip;<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s waaaay too expensive when you consider that their customer service is horrendous and people are going to expect good customer service with a product so expensive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never ever see another <strong>Pixel</strong> in your life,&rdquo; says Chrome VP Sundar Pichai.<br />
You heard it from the horse&rsquo;s mouth.. After today you will not see it again. Ever. :D</p>
<p>/troll</p>
<p>At least they got the marketing right!</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/p15dnnJ.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong><em>Because why the fuck not?</em></strong></p>
<p>It is pretty cool. Let&rsquo;s be honest</p>
<p>like osmium bullets</p>
<p>And how people would like those colorful lights if they presents notifications? No need to open display to see you have received new email or IM or video call is coming :D</p>
<p>And then you have to open the laptop to address either of those. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;d be that useful on a computer.</p>
<p>I have to agree.. I mean that price for a chrome web browser?</p>
<p>It makes me wonder if it&rsquo;s partly that expensive because it could be made entirely in the <span class="caps">USA</span> like the Nexus Q?</p>
<p>Which means that we should pre-order it, so that when Google decides that nobody actually wants to pay that much for a well designed, pricey piece of hardware with limited features, I&rsquo;ll get it for free.</p>
<p>Shhhhh!</p>
<p>Apparently it is not made in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p>
<p>No higher than $600 for even a high end chromebook&hellip;.for me</p>
<p>But I bet you are willing to pay 1499 or more for a retina macbook ;)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you just made the point you thought you were making.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t even making a point. I just said that he would pay the price for a macbook since it has a lot more features &ndash; as I would &ndash; even though I love Google. Don&rsquo;t always search for negativity in comments ;)</p>
<p>One of those things is not like the other, but i&rsquo;m not buying either of them.</p>
<p>same&hellip;. The screen would be great to have, but that&rsquo;s just simply way to much for a device that can only run chrome. What happens when the macbook air is retina and the same price?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to store everything in the cloud where Google can scan and index all of my private information. Local storage is important!</p>
<p>lol. keep living in your illusion of safety.</p>
<p>Um yeah, storing all of your documents &amp; data on the servers of a company known for collecting data about everyone&hellip;.now <span class="caps">THAT</span> is safe and smart.</p>
<p>if you use the internet, they have data on you, period.</p>
<p>Still doesn&rsquo;t mean you should share every file you create or collect with them.</p>
<p>sure thing bud.</p>
<p>But not all your documents and media that you generate or import locally and keep there. You have a <em>choice</em>. Don&rsquo;t deride other people for caring about that choice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m deriding him for caring about the choice, I&rsquo;m deriding him for thinking that it works.</p>
<p>It does work. I have material that is confidential to me and I keep it locally and encrypted. That data is not available to Google, et al. You responded that &ldquo;if you use the Internet they have data on you, period.&rdquo; Yes. But they don&rsquo;t have the data that they would have if I used their Cloud services to store everything. That is the clear point that the OP was making. And yes, it works.</p>
<p>And what benefit have you gained from this? That&rsquo;s my point: you have gained nothing except for an artificial construct of what digital privacy you may or may not have.</p>
<p>You just got scroogled /s</p>
<p>Then don&rsquo;t!  Problem solved!</p>
<p>Everyone that works at Google will have one of these. It will be a job requirement to use this on the job.<br />
Schmidt doesn&rsquo;t like seeing the apple logos all around his conference table.</p>
<p>Everyone? How will they get anything done? Seriously.</p>
<p>But its already a 6-7 week wait for the lte version!!!!</p>

<p>Microsoft should take note &ndash; this is a &lsquo;Proper&rsquo; Scroogling.</p>
<p>This from Quartz on twitter: Google&rsquo;s new Chromebook Pixel is the Windows-killing notebook the world needs <a href="http://qz.com/55837" target="_blank">http://qz.com/55837</a></p>
<p>Which is a fairly good point <span class="caps">IMO</span>, imagine if they gave one of these away at IO, now that would be quite the game changer I think.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for the fire sale.</p>
<p>That price is astronomical when I could get a gaming laptop with dual <span class="caps">GTX</span> 650M graphics cards, core i7 and 8 gigs of ram for $1049.</p>
<p>But no one wants a gaming laptop. I want a laptop that&rsquo;s thin, light, has the best screen available, the best keyboard available, the best trackpad available, is extremely well made out of good materials(not plastic) and therefore will last as long as possible. Then I also want a desktop that has the best power to price ratio with nothing else(size, design, etc.) being important. <br />
That said, the Chromebook Pixel simply costs too much for what it can do, a Macbook or Lenovo is what I&rsquo;m looking at. I need to be able to do a little Eclipse programming and whatnot on it.</p>
<p>For that price, I&rsquo;d rather just get a Macbook Air 13". Far better investment.</p>
<p>&hellip;<strong>too</strong> expensive.</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip; that&rsquo;s been bugging me too.</p>
<p>Especially when the Macbook Air and Windows Ultrabooks exist for less and run a real OS.</p>
<p><span class="caps">IMO</span> not too expensive just a bad value. There is a difference. I have no problem paying $1299+ to get a laptop with a high <span class="caps">DPI</span> display but for only a  bit more I can get a 13" MacBook Pro Retina that is better in every way and comes with a more capable OS. So $1299 is a low cost in dollars just not a good value <span class="caps">IMO</span> unless you are planning to replace ChromeOS. That helps close the value gap a lot.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgflip.com/mbf8.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>LOL.  wtf</p>
<p>I would expect more storage at that price point, but I guess they want you to be fully immersed in the Google ecosystem.</p>
<p>I would expect more functionality at that price point.</p>
<p>Holy cow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One terabyte Google Drive cloud storage for three years</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel/#pixel-specs" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel/#pixel-specs</a></p>
<p>Well, that certainly makes the deal more desirable.</p>
<p>for the first 3 years only&hellip;</p>
<p>Most people only keep a laptop for three years, so that&rsquo;s a pretty decent amount of time.</p>
<p>However, having such limited local storage kind of kills the deal. Whats the point of 1TB cloud storage if I can&rsquo;t dump 500gb of pictures onto my laptop, and then let it upload over time?</p>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s a problem if you create 500gb of pics on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Why would you transfer 500GB of pictures&hellip; from wherever they are&hellip; to your laptop and then upload them from there? Just upload them from wherever they are (guessing your desktop). If they are on an external drive, plug it into your desktop and then upload it&hellip; Why would you want to transfer them to your laptop, and then upload them?  That makes no sense</p>
<p>Porn.  Lots and lots of porn&hellip;</p>
<p>hmmm so</p>
<p>1.buy a $1300 browser, <br />
2. buy a laptop, use laptop to do things. <br />
3. upload them to google drive&hellip;.<br />
4  use $1300 browser to view what i created in my laptop<br />
5 ?<br />
6 profit???</p>
<p>Where are the 500gb of files stored currently? Let that upload the files&#8230;</p>
<p>But what happens after those 3 years? They would need to download their terabyte of data or start paying.</p>
<p>Tell that to my 5 year old ThinkPad, if this Chromebook is so well manufactured. It should last quite a long time.</p>
<p>At $50/month you&rsquo;re getting the laptop for free. An interesting proposition for businesses.</p>
<p>yes and no. You may replace your laptop in less than three years, but if you want to keep accessing your data after those three years, you will have to pay 50$ a month. Which if you ask me, makes the deal a bit less awesome.</p>
<p>Add to the fact that your can&rsquo;t have massive files on the device due to the tiny <span class="caps">HDD</span>. Sure you can upload 500Gbs worth of files, but they will have to be uploaded off a different storage device plugged to the laptop and God forbid you need to edit your <span class="caps">RAW</span> photos&hellip; That are saved online :/</p>
<p>I agree but you&rsquo;d have to think that the price of storage will be driven down over those 3 years by tech and competition.  If I was looking into buying large amounts of Dropbox storage for my staff I&rsquo;d have to look into this.  At that point the laptop is a bit of a throwaway though.  I can&rsquo;t think of someone that would get good use out of both a Chromebook and 1 TB of cloud storage unless Adobe is going to announce CS7 for Chrome OS soon.</p>
<p>That kind of thinking could get a guy in a lot of trouble. It&rsquo;s only a &lsquo;deal&rsquo; if you were actually going to buy that 1TB of storage for 3 years at the $50 monthly price.  If you weren&rsquo;t going to, then in the end you&rsquo;re still spending $1299-1500 more than you would have otherwise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply insane that they only threw in 32GB of storage in a $1,299 notebook.  No matter what cloud storage comes with it.</p>
<p>But how much does that cost you when your three years are up?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s normally $50 a month. So by order the Chromebook Pixel you are getting 1TB of Google Drive for 3 years at a big discount with a free laptop.</p>
<p>3 years of 1 TB Google Drive storrage is $1,800.</p>
<p>Yes, so if you&rsquo;re actually using that storage, in three years you&rsquo;re going to be stuck paying exorbitant prices for it.</p>
<p>Or, what&rsquo;s more likely to happen, you&rsquo;re barely going to use any of that&hellip; maybe 1/20th of it&hellip; and it turns out that it&rsquo;s a pure marketing thing.</p>
<p>So if you already pay for 1 TB of Google Drive for whatever reason, you could give Google $1,300 today.<br />
You would be prepaying for 3 years of GDrive at a $500 discount and you would get a free laptop.<br />
It&rsquo;s an interesting value proposition for a very niche user.</p>
<p>In 2 years time you&rsquo;ll probably be able to get 500GBs of cloud storage for free.  In 3 years time, you&rsquo;ll probably be able to get 1TB of cloud storage for free.  You aren&rsquo;t paying at a $500 discount, you are prepaying at an ever increasing premium because everyone knows, that storage <span class="caps">ALWAYS</span> gets cheaper.</p>
<p>I think the actual uses of a cloud drive of 1TB is perhaps very few. Cloud does have limitations of requiring network connection and bandwidth. Not to mention you need a device that can actually download the large files. A comparable external <span class="caps">HDD</span> is less than a tenth of the subscription price, available locally through <span class="caps">USB</span>, which is arguably a more widely available port than an internet connection.</p>
<p>or you could buy an actual laptop with similar spec (minus a bigger <span class="caps">HDD</span>/<span class="caps">SSD</span>) then go buy a 70$ 1 TB external <span class="caps">HDD</span> and come out cheaper no matter how you spin it with more capabilities.</p>
<p>For a random consumer, sure. That does not appear to be the target here. Everything they&rsquo;re saying says their aiming it specifically at high end individuals who want to go all out on cost.</p>
<p>That is an incredibly narrow addressable demographic.</p>
<p>I wonder what happens to your data if that runs out and you don&rsquo;t want to pay.</p>
<p>What Google&rsquo;s done for their current chromebook/drive offer (100gb for 2yrs), is after 2 years you still have access to whatever files you have uploaded, but you can&rsquo;t modify or add to them.</p>
<p>well if google says that this device is just meant to last you three years, figure in that you can get a new laptop with more storage by then.<br />
and since your 1TB is in the cloud, that means you can still access the stuff you had on it on your new laptop or device via the web. no issue.<br />
i think they are really encouraging people to go to the cloud on this thing. come to think of it, some of the already released chromebooks figure in close to the price of the free google drive storage.</p>
<p>Why would anyone get this over a MacBook Air?</p>
<p>The resolution.</p>
<p>At least until Apple debuts the Macbook Air with Retina Display.</p>
<p>$200 more gets you 13" Retina MacBook Pro with way more power (in terms of the OS, not the hardware itself).</p>
<p>Way more power? A bit more power. The Core i5 in this will be more than enough for ChromeOS.</p>
<p>Not only raw processing power, also an OS that can actually run real apps.</p>
<p>The word you&rsquo;re looking for is <em>Native.</em> Web apps are just as &ldquo;real&rdquo; as any other kinds.</p>
<p>Sure. Wake me up when there&rsquo;s an Adobe Creative Suite on the Pixel.</p>
<p>I think the word you are looking for is <em>Powerful</em>. Web apps like Google Docs may not be <em>Powerful</em>, but they&rsquo;re plenty &ldquo;real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever tried this ?<br /><a href="http://pixlr.com/editor/" target="_blank">http://pixlr.com/editor/</a><br />
Things like this are closing the gap between native and web apps pretty fast.</p>
<p>Well they are moving in that direction with the new stuff on the Dev channel. You can launch native apps instead of pure web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real apps&rdquo; are vastly overrated for today&rsquo;s common consumer.</p>
<p>Chromebooks in general have been slowly picking up speed over these past couple years. This Chromebook Pixel is just Google taking control into their own hands to build premium hardware to show everyone that they are fully behind the ChromeOS experience.</p>
<p>The common consumer isn&rsquo;t going to give a shit about most of the benefits this thing provides over the $250 <span class="caps">ARM</span> Chromebook. If they care enough about their computer to spend $1300 on it they&rsquo;re also going to want more than Chrome OS will provide.</p>
<p>Such as what? Sure they can go and get the rMBP, but then they don&rsquo;t have a touchscreen any longer.</p>
<p>This is a novelty project, like every other piece of physical hardware that Google creates in-house. No it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, which is what makes it kind of awesome <span class="caps">IMO</span>. If I were a rich geek I would have one.</p>
<p>Touchscreen is near-useless when your operating system is built around websites, most of which were designed around a cursor.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s other &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; products have a market. It&rsquo;s easy to see who a high-end phone for $300 off-contract is going to sell to. This, not so much.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I still want it though.</p>
<p>Why?  For a few hundred more you can have a rMBP which is a <span class="caps">WAY</span> nicer built machine running a full OS.  This would be a great product at half the price.  Right now?  It&rsquo;s a Q all over again.</p>
<p>How do you know it&rsquo;s &ldquo;more nicely built&rdquo;?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a <span class="caps">WAY</span> nicer built machine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think we were doubting the build quality of this. This looks as nicely-built as anything from Apple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>running a full OS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is what&rsquo;s in play here.</p>
<p>is this actually thick or it just looks thick?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <span class="caps">IBM</span> Thinkpad thick. They didn&rsquo;t shoot for a full-on <span class="caps">MBA</span> clone here.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have fat fingers, so web touch isn&rsquo;t an issue.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not true.  The Nexus 7 is quite popular as much more than a novelty project.  The same goes for the Nexus 4.  This is more like the orb thing they almost released, remember that, the $300 I think it was device that only streamed music similar to the $100 AppleTV?  I wonder if we preorder and they don&rsquo;t get enough demand those that preordered will get a free one just like they did with those orb things.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 is a little breakout star yes, but they intended for that to be the case when they decided to price it at $200.</p>
<p>Everything else like the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 10, the CR-48, and the Nexus Q you mentioned were never meant to be sales successes. Google isn&rsquo;t normally a hardware company, so when they do dabble in it, why not go crazy with something like this?</p>
<p>Why not make something successful instead?</p>
<p>Rich people don&rsquo;t want products that don&rsquo;t make sense anymore than less-rich people.</p>
<p>Most supercars don&rsquo;t make much practical sense. You&rsquo;re simply wrong to underestimate the buying power of the elite.</p>
<p>Bad analogy. The power of a flashy sportscar may not be needed (though they&rsquo;re fun to drive), but everyone can at least see that it has that power even if they think you&rsquo;re a flash git for spending all that money on it. But with this thing, you&rsquo;re paying a lot of money for something that does far less than things less than half the price. That doesn&rsquo;t make you look &ldquo;elite&rdquo;, it makes you look like you&rsquo;ve no idea what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>It actually makes even more sense as you delve into trying to combat the analogy.</p>
<p>This is the most-powerful Chromebook to date. It&rsquo;s the highest-resolution Chromebook to date. It&rsquo;s the prettiest Chromebook to date. And it&rsquo;s the most-expensive Chromebook to date as it follows.</p>
<p>The only real gripe with this Chromebook is that it runs ChromeOS, yet if someone prefers ChromeOS for any of its other attributes over Windows or <span class="caps">OSX</span> then it&rsquo;s a perfectly justifiable machine for them to purchase and own. Deal with it, don&rsquo;t hate.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>All of which would make sense if the market were only Chromebooks. But you analogy breaks down because people aren&rsquo;t saying: &ldquo;hey, my Chromebook is more capable than your Chromebook&rdquo;, they&rsquo;re saying: &ldquo;hey, my device is more capable than your device&rdquo;. And a Chromebook is never going to win that. The best it can normally do is come in ahead on battery life and this one fails abjectly at that because of the processor and the high-resolution screen.</p>
<p>We know that this device is catastrophically over-priced. You&rsquo;re trying to make the argument that for some people, your &ldquo;elites&rdquo;, they don&rsquo;t care if something is overpriced. But that&rsquo;s not complete. They don&rsquo;t care if something is overpriced if it is more capable or more trendy than other products. And this device cannot be the former and I severely doubt that it will be the latter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deal with it, don&rsquo;t hate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not hating and there&rsquo;s nothing I have to deal with. I have minimal emotional investment in this. I&rsquo;m just analysing.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a bit ridiculous to infer that anyone who buys this thing is some kind of luddite. ChromeOS on its own has attributes that some people may value over Windows or <span class="caps">OSX</span>, two platforms which have hardware spectrums from low-to-high. If Windows can go from $149 netbooks in Walmart to $1499 ultrabooks  in Microsoft stores then so can ChromeOS. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to claim there&rsquo;s not a market for this when the very purpose of this device is to broaden it.</p>
<p>Yes, but &ldquo;real consumers&rdquo; have absolutely no reason to pick up a $1300+ chromebook either.</p>
<p>That is exactly the problem.  You try to build this lightweight, browser based OS precisely because most services and app on the web are sufficient.  It runs on any computer, doesn&rsquo;t require local storage, and accomplishes 99.9999% of what the &ldquo;real consumer&rdquo; wants to do.  So why then build a $1300 version of that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but &ldquo;real consumers&rdquo; have absolutely no reason to pick up a $1300+ computer either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>fixed for you</p>
<p>&#8220;"Real apps" are vastly overrated for today’s common consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>lol. no.</p>

<p>If I was an executive of a company with accounts in the black and I solely relied on the google ecosystem, I would get this.</p>
<p>If I was to fault this device, I would say there&rsquo;s no need for it to exist.</p>
<p>yes if you were an executive you shouldn&rsquo;t be uploading sensitive documents online. even for an executive, especially so, a pure cloud based solution is the wrong solution. company secrets and all that jazz.</p>
<p>Yes there are.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have display manufacturers that would have production line ready for 3:2 display ratio and for that 2560&times;1700 px resolution at &lt;13" size.</p>
<p>Thats why laptops and tablets today have 16:9 format as it is dirty cheap and fast for manufacturers to make as they use same production lines for TV.</p>
<p>16:9 is terrible for laptops/desktops and even for tablets as most movies are already wider ratio than that. 3:2, 4:3 and 5:4 are way better for that purpose.</p>
<p>It all depends on what you do. Some people value vertical space, some value horizontal. I work in video production, lots of editing, coloring, and compositing, so I value horizontal space. Programmers dealing with a lot of code might value vertical space.</p>
<p>This. I do a lot of design and image editing on a Mac and prefer vertical space. Although when I occasionally do video production and visual effects, horizontal space seems to give better value for timelines and panels like you said. Ideally I&rsquo;d like to use one laptop for everything (watching movies, reading, browsing the web too), and personally I think like a 16:10 (8:5) aspect ratio is a nice happy medium. Obviously Google is much more web/consumer based, but I feel like they got the ratio right with the Nexus 10, not with the Pixel.</p>
<p>i value widescreens more as a designer. it&rsquo;s also invaluable doing simpler things like document editing as you can more easily display side by side documents.</p>
<p>Google is officially chrazy.</p>
<p>Nice superposition of &ldquo;Chrome&rdquo; and &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; Vlad.</p>
<p>Nice observation bud</p>
<p>you killed it</p>
<p>Nice portmanteau of &ldquo;Chrome&rdquo; and &ldquo;crazy&rdquo; Vlad.</p>
<p>Damn. That price&hellip;</p>
<p>Lack of storage aside, that looks like a really nice machine&hellip; for running something other than Chrome OS.</p>
<p>For that price, I rather get a full OS from Apple.  I can see $700-$800 for a premium Chromebook. But near Macbook Pro prices.</p>
<p>200$ and you&rsquo;ve got the rMBP13.  Why would anyone buy this&hellip;</p>
<p>If you are a student, $100 more will get you a rMBP</p>
<p>How could you say OS x is a full OS? You have a bit more programms to run but no way near as much as windows. Office is still the 2011 version, almost no games, business software run mostly on windows.</p>
<p>You should get a nice ultrabook if you&rsquo;re intrested in a full OS; with windows 8!</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>actually he says truth!</p>
<p>Actually, they don&rsquo;t. <span class="caps">OSX</span> is certainly a full OS. Ridiculous to say it isn&rsquo;t. They also based their definition of what determines if something is an OS or not on the quantity of programs available for it. They are spectacularly ignorant on the subject.</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>When I need Windows 8, I run it on a VM on my MacBook Air.</p>
<p>why do you need it? I know. To run professional programms, for example, in engeneering. Ihave 2 mac guys also in university who almost all day run w8,btw they very like it with good touchpad( as mac has one).</p>
<p>What kind of processor does it have? <span class="caps">ARM</span>? Atom? Core ix?</p>
<p>Pentium 2</p>
<p>To answer my own question: Engadget says it&rsquo;s a Core i5.</p>
<p>Says a dual core i5 on the product page. (<a href="http://goo.gl/7cAAL)" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/7cAAL)</a></p>
<p>it&rsquo;s called the pixel because that&rsquo;s how they calculated the cost i guess</p>
<p>Aw come on google i was expecting a &pound;500 machine, not 800+</p>
<p>More like &pound;1,000. <br />
$1,299 / 1.52 * 1.20 (<span class="caps">VAT</span>) = &pound;1,026.</p>
<p>Yeah good point. &pound;1000 is just too much for a device that runs a web browsers. I love my chromebook but and was excited for this but, no i wont be spending such a large sum on a device like that; even if it feels great.</p>
<p>Official price is &pound;1,049, score one for napkin maths.</p>
<p>Wow, they&rsquo;re letting you guys off cheap.  Normally you guys get gouged to the tune of 2x other countries don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 is &pound;239 here.</p>
<p>Mmmm, vertical screen resolution&hellip;How I have missed thee in this 16:9 era.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WHO</span>?<br />
Who would buy this?</p>
<p>the people that buy this will separate the fanboys from the enthusiasts.</p>
<p>i consider myself a fanboy&hellip; but i would NEVERbuy this&hellip; i think? maybe i can put another OS onto it? i mean i guess i only use chrome on my laptop anyway&hellip;. i have to think about it</p>
<p>You realistically can&rsquo;t put another OS onto it; it&rsquo;s only got 32GB for chrissakes.</p>
<p>So? OS&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t that big. Windows is very fat compared to others and it only takes 20 GB. Ubuntu installs to &lt;2. If you got rid of my games and the local copy of my music files (redundant anyways since they&rsquo;re backed up and in Google Music) I&rsquo;m only using about 9 GB and thats on a heavy use system. 32 gigs would be plenty for a linux users secondary computer.</p>
<p>If I just wanted a machine to run a lightweight distribution of Linux (which, do <em>any</em> of those currently support hi-res displays, incidentally?), this would not be the practical choice.</p>
<p>I am a huge Google fanboy and love ChromeOS but I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this even if I had the money.</p>
<p>Better question is why it needs i5? To run angry birds?</p>
<p>Someone already paying for 1 tb a year of google drive. Then the laptop is free, and they get a discount on cloud storage too.</p>
<p>A better question is, why do I want to rub my face on it like some sort of cracked out Joshua Topolsky?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to buy it, but lord, it is nice to look at.</p>
<p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin</p>
<p>Did not expect that</p>
<p>Hawt.</p>
<p>Is this the non-hating section?  I&rsquo;ll just pull up a chair&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="caps">WAT</span>? DIDN&rsquo;T <span class="caps">THEY</span> <span class="caps">LEARN</span> <span class="caps">FROM</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">NEXUS</span> Q?</p>
<p>Never heard of it.</p>
<p>Exactly</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait until they cut it in half and make another product out of it.</p>
<p>You mean cut it in half and make two 8" smartbooks instead? That&rsquo;s&hellip; novel.</p>
<p>Ty  g.    a f a  eyb ard c.  d be aw ward</p>
<p>So&hellip; you&rsquo;re saying I should just order this, so that they&rsquo;ll send me a free one when they decide to scrap the whole project?</p>
<p>Still not worth the risk&hellip; :-/ And I&rsquo;m a fan of Google. Really thought this would be down in the $800-900 range.</p>
<p>but&hellip;but&hellip; but it&rsquo;s google! It&rsquo;s so innovative !!! You&rsquo;ll be a coolest and most innovative guy ever ! Freedom !</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>another reason to go for the macbook air/pro. And that 4:3 ratio, its 2013!!</p>
<p>16:10 would have been preferable. I wish the 16:9 revolution never happened.</p>
<p>You have company. But hey, better than 4:3.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even 4:3, it&rsquo;s 3:2.</p>
<p>Who the hell uses 3:2?!?</p>
<p>iphones before #5.</p>
<p>Yes&hellip; phones.  That are held (mostly) vertically.</p>
<p>Right, they&rsquo;re held vertically&hellip; because vertical screen space is more valuable than horizontal space.  Which is why 3:2 &gt; 16:9.  The More vertical space, the better.</p>
<p>I never understood this. Normally tools on programs are to the left and right while we read and stack things horizontally.</p>
<p>&hellip;on a phone.  Vertical space is nice on a computer (16:10 is super popular among people in the know), but this is too extreme.  Maybe fine for a browser-only box, but it would be a joke for a real computer.</p>
<p>1) 16:10 is itself difficult to find<br />
2) This is largely a browser-only box,<br />
3) Even for a standard laptop, 2:3 &gt; 16:9 or 16:10.  I could see 4:3 being a happy medium, but those are impossible to find.  For anything that claims to be a productive device, vertical screenspace is more useful than pixels hanging out on your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>16:10 isn&rsquo;t a difficult-to-find aspect ratio. All of Apple&rsquo;s MacBooks aside from the 11" Air are 16:10, for instance.</p>
<p>Exactly. Not to mention the Nexus 10!</p>
<p>3: Web browsing is more productive with all the vertical space you can handle.  Multiple application window productivity benefits from horizontal space.  Since this is the fanciest browser you can buy for $1300, I can see how 3:2 makes sense.  Not the whole product mind you, but the resolution choice.</p>
<p>The aspect ratio makes sense for such a purpose, yes. The resolution choice doesn&rsquo;t, however, since much of the web isn&rsquo;t exactly optimized for high-<span class="caps">DPI</span> displays.</p>
<p>Text will look great.  But&hellip; $1300.  That price is still hard to grasp.</p>
<p>on mobile, vertical is more valuable because the physical real estate is much smaller regardless of resolution. you could perfectly read the same block of text on a widescreen laptop that just appears like grey blobs on the same resolution mobie phone.</p>
<p>context is important and it shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard to grasp.</p>
<p>On a laptop I&rsquo;d like my screen to be used for productive things rather than displaying an expanse of backdrop.  One 1920-wide window is a waste of space, while a 1920/2 is too narrow for productive use.  Vertical space is more useful than both.</p>
<p>Context is frequently invoked when people do not have a point to make.</p>
<p>but this&hellip; this is a laptop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And.&rsquo;  I believe you meant &lsquo;and.&rsquo;  &lsquo;But&rsquo; implies some conflict, which is not present here.  3:2 makes far, far more sense on a laptop than 16:9 does.  16:9 is good for portable <span class="caps">DVD</span> players, but not when you&rsquo;re reading or writing.</p>
<p>There is conflict here. We&rsquo;re talking about laptop aspect ratios and you brought the idea of that all the iphones before #5 were 3:2. We&rsquo;re talking about laptop aspect ratios. I never said 3:2 made sense, nor did I ever say anything about 16:9.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just saying we&rsquo;re talking about laptops here, which are a totally different experience than an iPhone.</p>
<p>There is no conflict.  I&rsquo;m talking about screens with useful space.  There is a common thread between iphone screens and laptops: vertical space is good.  Laptop screens are short on it, however.</p>
<p>ThinkPads use 3:2 as well.</p>
<p>Name me a ThinkPad that offers a 3:2 screen.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t problem what ratio the display is as GUIs have been for long time designed to be scalable. But those who really want to make <span class="caps">GUI</span> using bitmaps without any scaling possibilities&hellip; they are so out..</p>
<p>I hate my dual 16:9 screens at work. Dual 3:2 would be excellent.</p>
<p>Laughing my ass off at people who were claiming that this would be under $500. This is more ridiculous that Surface RT.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DOA</span></p>
<p>I am no Surface Pro fan,  for a number of reasons, but at this price, GO Surface pro.. Lol</p>
<p>Surface RT is what an iPad wants to be.</p>
<p>Tell us another one, do.</p>
<p>Only in your Microsoftie little mind. An iPad wants to be what it is, the best tablet on the market, it has no pretensions to be part tablet, part computer whilst singularly failing to be very good at either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Apple are happy to leave that particular concept to Microsoft.</p>
<p>lol. 1300 for a browser?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get the feel of a luxury car door opening and closing,&rdquo; says Pichai.&rsquo;"</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that what the surface people said?</p>
<p>And it hasn&rsquo;t really been debunked&hellip;</p>
<p>Build quality /= a good device.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have a good device without good build quality, but you can have good build quality without having a good device.</p>
<p>Many of my favorite devices have been those I can hack, alter and risk breakage without worrying too much about the replacement cost.  I&rsquo;d far rather have cheap and hackable than gold-plated and shackled-by-price.</p>
<p>Yes! lol These guys! We&rsquo;re being Pixel&rsquo;d!</p>
<p>What door on the Surface are you talking about?</p>
<p>Kickstand</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the same thing panos panay said about surface kickstand.</p>
<p>And, the price is wrong. Kudos, Google. If you can get someone to buy this, your marketing skills are better than I thought.</p>
<p>Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh myyyyyyyyyyy Godddddddddddddd.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another Nexus Q.</p>
<p>Should I buy it now and hope they send it to me for free?</p>
<p>So I can touch the screen and smudge the pixels I can&rsquo;t see&hellip;got it!</p>
<p>$1299 for a glorified webbrowser. Google, I like you, but this is bananas.</p>
<p>Hey Verge, why did you delete my comment :(</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to use this with my $9,600 Vertu Android phone.</p>
<p>To hangout with your imaginary girlfriend?</p>
<p>This looks truly amazing, but $1299 is far too much. Lop $500 off and I&rsquo;ll buy one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, actually I&rsquo;m starting to reconsider. Absolutely beautiful design, best screen around, great keyboard and trackpad. Put Ubuntu on it and you&rsquo;ve got a real laptop with all of those things. That might be worth $1299.</p>
<p>Buy a Dell XPS12. Beautiful hi-res screen, touch, thinner+lighter+faster+better battery, and it has a keyboard. And, oh yeah, a real OS.</p>
<p>I have no idea how this monstrosity exists.</p>
<p>And why Linux isn&rsquo;t a real OS? What it is missing so it would fill the requirements of &ldquo;real OS&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I think they meant that if you were looking for something to put Ubuntu on, the Dell is a better target than this thing, not that Ubuntu is bad. I took the &ldquo;real OS&rdquo; comment to be a comparison to ChromeOS, rather than a comparison to Ubuntu (at least I hope so).</p>
<p>But I hate Dell. And Windows. And this is noticeably cheaper then the 13" rMBP and has almost as good of specs.</p>
<p>You mean apart from the fact you can&rsquo;t run software on it?</p>
<p>Please read my previous comment, in which I said if I were thinking of buying one I would install Ubuntu on it.</p>
<p>Pay $200 more and you can have a rMBP that can boot <span class="caps">OSX</span>, W8, or Linux.  With a real store to go to for support, and even better specs (<span class="caps">RAM</span>, local storage).  This has no place in the market.</p>
<p>The rMBP is $1349 at MacConnection. So it is only $50 more!</p>
<p>It looks like a compelling bit of hardware that&rsquo;s crippled by a goofy OS (and lack of local storage). I suspect 90% of these will end up running a real Linux distro or be returned.</p>
<p>Who is going to spend this $$$ for a browser?</p>
<p>When I saw that price I had to read it twice, I was trying to rework the numbers to make it look right, no use.</p>
<p>I thought this was an April Fools joke when I first saw it. But then I realized it&rsquo;s mid-February.</p>
<p>That was my first thought as well</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Google and an Android die-hard, but: is this a joke? If I&rsquo;m going to spend that much on a laptop, it better be able to freaking use software.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WTF</span> just happened??!!</p>
<p>DOA. Incredible hardware but its still over $1000 for what is essentially a browser.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Google is expecting this to be a doorbuster in terms of sales.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an understatement. I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;d have to be clinically insane to pay that price.</p>
<p>If this is Googles vision of ChromeBooks then good luck Google, your going to need it.</p>
<p>hahahahajaja</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/06/28/Google_Nexus_Q_ports.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Too soon man ;__;</p>
<p><span class="caps">RIP</span>?</p>
<p>I see Google is early with their April Fool&#8217;s joke this year.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_manv9jmGSw1r9tn1n.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>insane pricing &ndash; I dont see who would buy this over say an <span class="caps">MBP</span>.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s cheerleaders would.</p>
<p>not even google&rsquo;s cheerleaders will buy this</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s always a cheerleader or two who will put out, regardless of whether it&rsquo;s wise to do so.</p>
<p>considering how price conscious google&rsquo;s fans are, it&rsquo;s hard to think they&rsquo;d back this&hellip; but then again ppl did attempt to buy the Q&hellip;.</p>
<p>And they call Apple fan boys sheep&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Core i5 processor and Intel&rsquo;s integrated graphics&rdquo;<br />
gah sucks, was hoping for <span class="caps">ARM</span></p>
<p>Yeah, I&rsquo;m not quite sure how different this is in terms of processor requirements from a Nexus 10&hellip;</p>
<p>There is a disconnect between Google sales/product people and the nation at large when it comes to income.    This may sound fine to someone that has a six figure income, but most of the world is far from this.</p>
<p>To be fair,  id bet that most folks rocking mba/mbp&#8217;s arent bringing in 6 figures.  And i bet alot of them only listen to music,  surf the web and watch videos.</p>
<p>Not totally defending google here,  but apple has proven that people will pay a premium for a nice product,  even if only to do basic things.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, but at the same time there are two types of people who purchase chromebooks. People who don&rsquo;t want to spend a ton of money and people that understand that it&rsquo;s a consumption device. The second group of people wont want to spend &pound;1000+ on a consumption device when there are other alternatives out there.</p>
<p>A lot of them develop software for Google and Google&rsquo;s products.</p>
<p>What a disgusting device. The only thing even remotely interesting about this is the resolution. Everything else has been done better elsewhere, even by Apple.</p>
<p>Care to expand? Or is that all you have?</p>
<p>Hm let&rsquo;s see. rMBP is thinner, has better battery life, has the <span class="caps">BEST</span> trackpad on any laptop (touchscreen is just a futile attempt by PC makers to compensate for their terrible trackpads), has more storage, can boost OS X, Linux, Windows, has superior customer support. And you can get it for as cheap as ~$1400 in the US.</p>
<p>Do I need to say more?</p>
<p><img title="LULZ" src="http://i.imgur.com/59Vt6.gif" alt="LULZ" /></p>

<p>Too fast for ya?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Where is Khalid when you need him</p>
<p>It looks like a <span class="caps">CRT</span> compared to the Air.</p>
<p>I think there was a typo. That 1 in $1299 wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be there.</p>
<p>That Apple tax in full effect&hellip;..oh wait</p>
<p>What <span class="caps">EXACTLY</span> am I paying for at that price point? This must be a damn joke&hellip;.smh Let me get back to work.</p>
<p>For an all metal notebook with an insane resolution touchscreen. Those panels can&#8217;t come cheap.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s way too close to the price point of a Retina <span class="caps">MBP</span> 13", which is already too expensive for the market&hellip;</p>
<p>Yup, this makes the 13&rsquo;&rsquo; rMBP look like an awesome deal, especially with the recent price cut. I&rsquo;m really happy this product is real, though.</p>
<p>Is it April 1 already?</p>
<p>The price is ridiculous, but if nothing else it&rsquo;s worthwhile for helping to break the tyranny of widescreens-on-every- laptop.</p>
<p>that will only happen if this thing sells. this thing is priced just right to stay on the shelves.</p>
<p>Sadly, you make a good point.</p>
<p>They can put <span class="caps">LTE</span> in a chromebook, but not in the nexus? cmon google.</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not a phone, if it&rsquo;s a phone then the carrier will have it&rsquo;s way with you.</p>
<p>Touchscreen laptops are pointless if you can&rsquo;t swivel them all the way back. The 3:2 AR is interesting though.</p>
<p>I use combo of keyboard and touchscreen when i have my surface in &ldquo;laptop mode&rdquo; with keyboard and kickstand out</p>
<p>No they&#8217;re  not.  Was just playing with my sisters last night and it was awesome.</p>
<p>Well that escalated quickly.</p>

<p>Guys we have a winner</p>
<p>Shut it down.  This guy won.</p>
<p>So who exactly is the target demographic for this again? I don&rsquo;t think even the biggest of Google lovers would shell out for this. Sometimes it seems like Google is just throwing shit against the wall just to see what sticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google has made a billion-dollar business out of &ldquo;throwing shit against the wall to see what sticks.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think they have much shame in beta-testing stuff like this.</p>
<p>Especially beta testing a consumer market device for $1299 and $1449. They better have some big updates coming for Chromebook OS to justify anything close to this price.</p>
<p>The CR-48 was a beta test.  This is a product.</p>
<p>This is a product with a beta price.</p>
<p>they were supposed to have stopped doing that when one of the boys came back to ceo the company. it seems it has slowly crept back into the company. even ms takes multi years to release random duds. google just keeps releasing them one after another.</p>
<p>they really need to focus. it&rsquo;s nt like their current products are anywhere near perfect. chrome has a harder time playing youtube videos and displaying their own image search than IE! and these are their own products.</p>
<p>Ah well, so much for that then, 500 of any currency is about where I draw the line for a laptop</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to get a laptop then</p>
<p>500 Japanese Yen equals<br />
5.37 US Dollar</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that was meant to be literal. More like the &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; of $500 rather than 500 InsertCurrencyHere.</p>
<p>50000 will net you something pretty nice, even with Japanese electronic prices.</p>
<p>I think it was intended as 500 of insert currency here but he wasn&rsquo;t thinking of countries like japan. But more 500 <span class="caps">USD</span>/<span class="caps">GBP</span>/<span class="caps">EUR</span>/<span class="caps">CAD</span>  etc,  just had to have a bit of fun with him</p>
<p>500 pesos?</p>

<p>I am the biggest Google fanboy there has been, and I would like to sincerely request other commentors not to say anything in Google&rsquo;s defense here</p>
<p>Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but isn&rsquo;t Chrome OS free? I remember setting up a VM with the OS a year or so ago. At least with Mac OS you aren&rsquo;t paying $1300 for a free OS! I honestly love their commercials for their $250 laptop, a perfect market for them to be in. $1300 is nuts.</p>
<p>Chromium OS is free and open-source. Chrome OS isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Quick, pre-order one &ndash; maybe you&rsquo;ll get one free like the Nexus Q!</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly</p>
<p>They are in stock, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a pre-order. You would be paying $1300 to browse the web on a high-res screen and it would ship to you in 3-5 days.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot &ndash; you can also play Angry Birds.</p>
<p>you can play angry birds with it? Wow so innovative.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t sell well, it may help to prove that the majority of chromebook&rsquo;s appeal is price, not functionality.  Same could be said for android tablets</p>
<p>And your point is? Cheap hardware wins, especially running a decent OS.</p>
<p>my point is that chromebooks are popular because of price not necessarily substance.</p>
<p>Of course they are. They have substance too, that was my point.</p>
<p>Eh, i think that you can justify a consumption device for &pound;300. I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a macbook because i&rsquo;d do the same things i&rsquo;m doing on my chromebook. Surfing the internet, watching films, listening to music and writing emails and documents. <br />
I remote desktop my pc if i need to do photo editing because the chromebook isn&rsquo;t powerful enough, but i wouldn&rsquo;t spend an extra 700 on a macbook or chromebook to do that.</p>
<p>Try putting iOS into an Galaxy S <span class="caps">III</span> body and see if it will see millions then. It won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Chromebooks?  Yes.  Android tablets?  Eh depends.  There are lot of em</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/8FxEa.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Oh man&#8230; This.</p>
<p>Oh man, I&rsquo;m laughing so hard I&rsquo;m tearing up! <span class="caps">ROFL</span>!</p>
<p>Only explanation I can think of for this is to compare it to the Glass Explorer edition. A pilot product for developers, as a model for future, cheaper devices. Still pretty bonkers though.</p>
<p>Are those other Chromebooks in the background?</p>
<p><img title="$1,299" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1266325/kobev.gif" alt="$1,299" /></p>
<p>Sorry, but I don&rsquo;t get the price.</p>
<p>What!?</p>
<p>I look at the pictures and when I read &ldquo;While it&rsquo;s a hair thicker than the MacBook Air&hellip;&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m thinking of really really thick hair. Really really thick.</p>
<p>Seriously! I was just about to post the exact same thing. That&rsquo;s like 2.5x as thick. Must have been veiled sarcasm.</p>
<p>Yeah. I when I read 32GB of storage and WiFi only at 1300$, I&rsquo;m thinking <span class="caps">WTF</span>. Seriously.<br />
1TB of online storage is good, but still. 64GB on-board at least.</p>
<p>they refer to the thickest point of teh <span class="caps">MBA</span>, not the tapered end.</p>
<p>Ah k. Not too bad. But still, it&rsquo;s the thickest point of the <span class="caps">MBA</span> for all the Chromebook.</p>
<p>I just compared the specs, and this is thinner. Weird&hellip;</p>
<p>I love my $250 samsung chromebook cuz it&#8217;s hot a great price for what it can do. This is outrageously expensive. I&#8217;d get one for $900 max as long as I can dual boot Linux on it. Otherwise, keep dreaming Google&#8230;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d just like to interject for a moment. What you&rsquo;re referring to as Linux, is in fact, <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux, or as I&rsquo;ve recently taken to calling it, <span class="caps">GNU</span> plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning <span class="caps">GNU</span> system made useful by the <span class="caps">GNU</span> corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by <span class="caps">POSIX</span>.</p>
<p>Many computer users run a modified version of the <span class="caps">GNU</span> system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of <span class="caps">GNU</span> which is widely used today is often called &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the <span class="caps">GNU</span> system, developed by the <span class="caps">GNU</span> Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.</p>
<p>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&rsquo;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the <span class="caps">GNU</span> operating system: the whole system is basically <span class="caps">GNU</span> with Linux added, or <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux. All the so-called &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; distributions are really distributions of <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux.</p>

<p>Hi, Richard.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t he have a foot to go pick or something?</p>
<p>Just . . . no.  Stop it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GNU</span> really gets more credit than it deserves. Why stop at <span class="caps">GNU</span>/Linux, when you can call it <span class="caps">GNU</span>/X.org/<span class="caps">GNOME</span>/Unity/Apache/<span class="caps">KDE</span>/Linux?</p>
<p>After all, many of the components I&rsquo;ve mentioned (like <span class="caps">KDE</span>, <span class="caps">GNOME</span>) have larger code bases than commonly-used <span class="caps">GNU</span> tools like glibc, gcc, coreutils, etc added together.</p>
<p>More obsessed with politics than solutions?  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;ll never win the desktop.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically a morbidly obese Macbook with a touch panel, that can only run web apps.</p>
<p>The argument that Macs are overpriced is now invalid.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Macs are still overpriced, this is just <em>more</em> overpriced.</p>
<p>Works offline?</p>
<p>This I want to know.</p>
<p>Of course not, it can&rsquo;t show ads without an internet connection.</p>
<p>Sure it can, with a 32gb local cache!</p>
<p>I hate to be that guy, but I would more likely just buy a 999$ macbook air, unless screen resolution was of absolute importance to me&#8230;</p>
<p>You can almost buy a macbook pro for this price.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DAT</span> <span class="caps">ASPECT</span> <span class="caps">RATIO</span></p>
<p>I really love that less wide aspect ratio. I hope more laptops use it.</p>
<p>Came to say this.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s basically a $1300 morbidly obese Macbook with a touch panel, that can only run web apps.</p>
<p>The argument that Macs are overpriced is now invalid.</p>
<p>late edit: didn&rsquo;t mean to post this twice so don&rsquo;t yell at me.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MAGNETS</span></strong></p>
<p>Wow, that price must include a couple of Google Glass prototypes, a Google selfdriving car and a Nexus 4.</p>
<p>&hellip;sure thing</p>
<p>Watching the video on Engadget it doesn&#8217;t look as near to the Mac book as it initially did so that&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>It atleast needs to be half that price&hellip;..and u say apple products are expensive.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/wsfa3eF.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t say Google isn&rsquo;t innovative, here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this case, they&rsquo;re innovating to answer a question nobody was asking: &ldquo;what would a super-premium Chromebook look like, and cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That depends on how you define innovation.  If you stick to the basic definition as the introduction of &ldquo;something new&rdquo;, then I will definitely say that nobody has ever introduced a Core-i5 3:2 Retina display laptop in a case designed like something out of 2004 running an OS that is only a browser.  However, when we have products that are already superior to this then it is hard to see it as innovative.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t get too snarky.  People fell all over themselves to purchase iOS devices that were demonstrably less capable than their contemporary competitors, to the same degree that Chrome OS is less capable than Windows or OS X.</p>
<p>But iOS provided superior usability by the introduction of Touch. Chrome OS uses basically the same concepts that PCs and Macs use but limits what the OS does.</p>
<p>iOS was not even remotely the first touch-based OS in smartphones.</p>
<p>Chrome OS is touch-driven, as well, something that no Mac can say (and few PCs can say).</p>
<p>Sure, this product probably will be a bust, but the idea that it doesn&rsquo;t resemble other ridiculously priced, stripped down products that went on to sell well is a bit silly.</p>
<p>Seriously?  Come on.  Chrome OS is touch-driven in the same way that Windows 7 was touch driven.</p>
<p>I think the problems that people had with touch on Windows 7, and have with touch on the Windows 8 desktop was exaggerated, but there&rsquo;s no question it was bolted on afterwards, just like here.</p>
<p>Chrome is touch-optimized.  Windows 7 wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that I&rsquo;m having a bit of fun with all of this.  The reaction to Google&rsquo;s proposition around this sorta proves the whole &ldquo;post PC&rdquo; thing is malarkey.</p>
<p>Yes it was.</p>
<p>I have an <span class="caps">ASUS</span> Windows 7 tablet.  Windows 7 certainly wasn&rsquo;t optimized for touch&hellip; the consumer preview of 8 was a godsend on that device.</p>
<p>Again, Windows 7 is just as optimized for touch as this Chromebook will be.  The OS supported touch scrolling / panning, and pinch to zoom.  (In fact, it was Chrome itself that didn&rsquo;t support those in Windows 7.)  It&rsquo;s touch thrown onto an OS that wasn&rsquo;t fully designed for it.  I mean, do you really think that the app shown here was optimized for touch with those small targets?</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/7732785/theverge-pixel-15_2040_verge_super_wide.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>In Windows 7 (and 8) at least you could change the size of any part of your desktop.  And touch worked great in apps that supported it:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f8iIU2RNO4" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f8iIU2RNO4</a></p>
<p>Sorry, but pinch to zoom was garbage on Windows 7.  Herky-jerky resizing in IE and other apps.</p>
<p>It was clearly a desktop OS with touch bolted on as an afterthought.  Even the touch keyboard was&hellip;. <strong>shudder</strong></p>
<p>I thank the tech gods for Windows 8.  <span class="caps">SUCH</span> an improvement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was clearly a desktop OS with touch bolted on as an afterthought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said that from the beginning, and Chrome OS looks to be identical in that regard.  That was my whole point in the first place.</p>
<p>Chrome still needs to get pinch to zoom to be any good in Win 8. Last time I tried it was still jerky and terrible. At least scrolling works now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll sell 3 of them. Brin, Page, and Scmidt will buy them.</p>
<p>Not likely. I don&rsquo;t think they even owned the Nexus Q</p>
<p>And <span class="caps">MKBHD</span></p>
<p>I understand your reference tech brother.</p>
<p>They will get it for free man.</p>
<p>I can see Brin and Page going halfsies on one though</p>
<p>Okay, everyone is being incredulous about the price. But are there any retina resolution, touch screen laptops out there right now, as we speak, that cost significantly lower than this?</p>
<p>From what I can tell, and please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but if they priced this lower, they would be taking a loss on every one they sell, yes? If that&rsquo;s the case, then it&rsquo;s like everyone wants all these different high-end hardware features, but they don&rsquo;t actually want to pay for them.</p>
<p>Probably, but Chrome OS is so limited it&rsquo;s hard to justify paying a premium price for the hardware it runs on.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s just that no one is happy. If they had just said &ldquo;you know, this is too expensive, we shouldn&rsquo;t make this&rdquo;, there would be people proclaiming how they wish they had. I mean, look at the promo-movie they had from a few weeks ago about this that everyone was calling &ldquo;fake&rdquo;, yet people were going on and on about how much they&rsquo;d just <span class="caps">LOVE</span> to have one of those things. Well, they made one, and they priced it probably right on the edge of any profit, and people are hating on it.</p>
<p>Go figure.</p>
<p>That sounds too much like common sense&hellip;. ;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go figure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the figure: $1500 for a web browser.</p>
<p>I would suggest you compare it to the Surface Pro. It&rsquo;s only lower on the Resolution but has a similar processor, a lot more <span class="caps">SSD</span> storage (which is still rather expensive) also a Touch Screen and can do anything this thing can &ndash; given that you can install Chrome on there. You also get a Wacom digitizer there which is also not really cheap. So yes: I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s to expensive.</p>
<p>But also getting a terabyte of online storage for 3 years for free&hellip;which comes out (at current Google Drive prices) to $1800 for that 3 years.</p>
<p>Meh&hellip;I really don&rsquo;t want either. I&rsquo;m just amazed that people that saw that leaked video a few weeks ago were falling over themselves saying how great it looked, how they wish it was real and how they&rsquo;d totally get one. Now that it&rsquo;s here, and probably on the knife-edge of cost margins, they don&rsquo;t want it.</p>
<p>there might not be any unicycles with a high quality bmw designed sunroof and even if someone designed it, i still wouldnt buy it.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand the purpose of this device. I love my <span class="caps">ARM</span> chromebook but no chromebook makes sense at $1300. I&rsquo;m baffled by this product.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2094/2212239186_6afb63d336.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Obviously they know they&rsquo;re not going to sell a ton of these. The point is to help shed the stigma that ChromeOS is for cheap products only and can&rsquo;t compete with &ldquo;real&rdquo; OS&rsquo;s. Think outside the box people.</p>
<p>Are you f**king kidding me?</p>
<p>thanks, but no thanks. i&rsquo;m perfectly fine with running chrome on my &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; product which can also do Photoshop, video editing and much more &hellip; for that money i can by a Retina MacBook Pro</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re purely planting a seed to change people&rsquo;s perceptions. Google is thinking about the big picture. ChromeOS is years from being competitive. People don&rsquo;t have to buy it. The fact that it exists is enough for now.</p>
<p>But I thought we were in a &ldquo;post-PC era,&rdquo; where simple and less capable devices (like this Chromebook and iPads) would replace all those nasty old-fashioned Mac OS X and Windows devices.</p>
<p>You mean to tell me that Apple is full of hooey?!?</p>
<p>&rsquo;grats.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was thinking that, perhaps they just looking to pitch a product at those that would look at a macbook, the smarts are in the software anyway.</p>
<p>Oh hey awesome, a high-quality Chromebook with an incredibly high-res display.  Nice to see the Google is finally get serious about Chro&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;$1,299&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;<span class="caps">BAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA</span> what?!?</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://silellak.com/gifs/CarCliff.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>An ugly looking Macbook Pro?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll just leave this here&hellip;</p>

<p>Marvelous :)</p>
<p>They are high for that price range or they desperately need a premium product for their upcoming Google Store.</p>
<p>Not going to sell and no way they will move at this price.</p>
<p>I think everyone at Google IO will be very happy when they get there Oprah moment and its this computer.</p>
<p>This comment thread is hands down the funniest thing I have seen on the Verge in weeks.</p>
<p>Seriously though, the price is all wrong. I appreciate the value of the laptop you are getting and the screen does have the potential to be awesome, but for that price.. My lord&hellip;  Google has lost the plot if they expect people to pay 1300$ for a laptop that needs always on internet connection to be used correctly.</p>
<p>Anyway, Moving on with my day.</p>
<p>if i had $1299 sitting around, i&rsquo;d rather put it towards a glass</p>
<p>Totally agreed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gifbin.com/983317"><img src="http://gifs.gifbin.com/082009/1250852526_kermit_bale_emma.jpg.gif" alt="funny gifs" /></a></p>
<p>yup</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t understand is that for a computer that only runs web and has close to nothing in it, it still manages to be a huge clunky thing. The MacBook Air does more, and has more in it yet its thin as hell&hellip;. So google what&rsquo;s your excuse? And do they honestly think this will sell that well?</p>
<p>It even has a better battery life! If Chrome OS doesn&rsquo;t get a significant revamp now, this product is going to go down in history as one of the most overpriced electronics ever</p>
<p>Well, there was the Q&hellip;</p>
<p>A $1299 web browser?<br />
Someone in marketing is sniffing glue.</p>
<p>I think this sums up their mindset pretty nicely:<br /><img title="Chromebook" src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3z1W3U0b261K0R313g0w/Schermafbeelding%202013-02-21%20om%2020.20.17.png" alt="Chromebook" /></p>
<p>/thread</p>
<p>Google you&rsquo;re drunk.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/KK4i0aK.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Yeah i don&rsquo;t think so. I wonder if it&rsquo;ll ever come down in price.</p>
<p>This is mind boggling.</p>
<p>Google is brilliant. I&rsquo;ve always had the desire to pay $1,300 for a MacBook Pro that only runs Chrome.</p>
<p>A chunkier macbook pro rip off with only 32GB of internal storage and 5 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>At this price, I&rsquo;ll shell out the extra $200 and get something like a Lenovo X1 Carbon Touch.</p>
<p>Maybe if it was a 17" laptop I would be more interested.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they learn from the Nexus Q that a ridiculous price for a small amount of features doesn&rsquo;t work?</p>
<p>I think this is the herald for a much better chrome OS experience</p>
<p>What a waste. Can I just get the monitor please?</p>
<p>I want that display in a real laptop with a real OS with decent storage 8GB of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and a decent graphics card.</p>
<p>Buy a Nexus 10 and you&rsquo;re getting pretty close to just having the display.</p>
<p>Lol I never thought of it this way! Nexus 10+Bluetooth keyboard. Better screen, better battery life, better operating system and less than half the price</p>
<p>Verizon <span class="caps">LTE</span>? So Google does play nice with <span class="caps">VZW</span> after all. Is it safe to assume the same network connectivity in the next Nexus now?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;a hair thicker&hellip;&rdquo; Are you guys seeing the same pictures above as me?</p>
<p>Aside from most of Google&rsquo;s products, which I find aesthetically beautiful, that notebook is brutally ugly and far too expensive for its price tag.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re basically getting a $500 discount on 3 years of 1TB of Google Drive with a free laptop. Sounds much better when you think of it that way.</p>
<p>Sure, but what are you storing in a 1TB Drive account?  Who does that appeal to?</p>
<p>And you only have 32GB of local storage. What kind of data do you have that would take up 1TB in the cloud, but less than 32GB locally?</p>
<p>I think this plays into the same thing they did with the Nexus 4. They don&rsquo;t see you as needing a 1:1 sync with whats available to you offline and what is in your drive.</p>
<p>I think Google is making a play to change users storage habits but they may be a little early. Someone like myself has bought into that with how I manage music on my phone now. It will be harder to get people to make that same change for all of their files.</p>
<p>unless internet is cheaper and more reliable in more parts of the world, I dont see this as a feasible solution for storing your content.</p>
<p>Definitely a good point. It actually wouldn&rsquo;t even appeal to me, my biggest use of space was music which is in the cloud for free. I would never need any more than the 25gb plan for Drive if I decided to use it full time. I actually get away with 3.5gbs of Dropbox now with no issues.</p>
<p>I just wanted to play sort of a devils advocate and look at the price from a different view.</p>
<p>It does, until you realize that it&rsquo;s probably cost prohibitive to maintain that storage that you&rsquo;ve grown so accustomed to in perpetuity after that 3 years.</p>
<p>use it as an s3 replacement ^^</p>
<p>&hellip;it sounds better if you&rsquo;re drunk too.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean it makes sense.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t learn a damn thing from the Nexus Q &ndash; another mind-bogglingly overpriced and under-featured product. I expect this to live about as long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s a hair thicker than the MacBook Air&rdquo;</p>
<p>You have some damned impressive hair, sir.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HAHAHAH</span> oh man when i read that it&rsquo;s only a hair thicker and then saw the photos I nearly pooped myself. The thing looks like my old Dell Latitude from 2004. Aside from the resolution, this thing seems like a step back.</p>
<p>dont get scroogled homeys</p>
<p>Probably the funniest comments ever&hellip;<br />
Never laughed so hard about gifs!</p>
<p>Google has lost their fucking minds. First the glass crap then this.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not too locked down, you should be able to use this as a Windows laptop. Seems like a good deal with Windows, right?</p>
<p>nop. you can get better laptops for that much money</p>
<p>Not with a non-wide aspect ratio, and not with that kind of res.</p>
<p>With 32Gb of storage?</p>
<p>So, I could purchase&hellip;</p>
<p>A Nexus 4 16 GB<br />
A Nexus 7 16 GB<br />
A Nexus 10.1 16 GB<br />
The new Samsung Chromebook<br />
A Kindle Paperweight</p>
<p>or this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Kindle Paperweight</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haha, nice typo.</p>
<p>Kindle Paperweight, you say? Where might I procure this mystical device?</p>
<p>Buy a Kindle Fire, wait a month. You&rsquo;ll have it!</p>
<p>Nice!! Just the recommend wasn&rsquo;t enough</p>
<p>Why wait a month, the Kindle Fire is out now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get the feel of a luxury car door opening and closing&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it the same thing panos panay said about surface kick stand?</p>
<p>The same suckers who bought the Nexus Q will be the same ones who purchase this thing. Can&rsquo;t see this lasting more than a few months on the market.</p>
<p>Maybe this has a touchscreen thats not enabled yet or it shits fairy dust. Either or. Can you even dual boot Windows on this not that I would?</p>
<p>damnit Google, why did you have to copy the stupid MacBook silver color, I absolutely hate that I can&rsquo;t use my MacBook outside w/out squinting&hellip;.give me matte black options.</p>
<p>just fyi&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Gogole</strong> also demoed a new Google+ app&rdquo;</p>
<p><img title="Swing and a miss" src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/838211/JohnsonSwingMiss.gif.opt.gif" alt="Swing and a miss" /></p>
<p>Google have been doing well with the Nexus devices, and then this. Well okay</p>
<p>It feels like they purposely sabotage their Nexus line of devices so they never sell too many.</p>
<p>Well, we wouldn&rsquo;t want that now, would we?</p>
<p>The laptop itself looks really solid and beautiful. I just don&rsquo;t think ChromeOS is good enough for a $1300 price. It&rsquo;s good as a model and maybe now Samsung and other manufacturers will step their game up and produce much better (but still cheap) Chromebooks. In my opinion, ChromeOS isn&rsquo;t worth anything above $500, if that. That&rsquo;s right now though, if they can add better features and make it more usable for a heavier user, then it might be worth more. On another note, the price doesn&rsquo;t really match what Google has been marketing the Chromebooks as, which is a basic laptop for a basic user. Bringing out this beast of a machine though, maybe they&rsquo;re working on something big for ChromeOS.</p>
<p>Why I should ever buy something like this?  For $1250 I can buy a MacBook Pro and get everything Apples ecosystem has to offer.  I could buy any number of higher-end Windows 7 or 8 laptops that offer limitless software options or I could buy 2 mid grade Windows laptops and a Nexus tablet.  All of these options can have Chrome installed on them for free and still access everything Google offers.</p>
<p>Hell, I could buy a <strong>Linux</strong> machine and still run Chrome&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>What gives?</p>
<p>Feels like .. Nexus Q</p>
<p>Maybe an update for native apps is in the works? Plenty of time between now and April.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of fail here from Google (which I totally did not expect) and some humorous gifs.</p>
<p>Man, what the hell is this?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an absurd price point for a product of this caliber. And that storage is absurdly low. I mean, I get that it&rsquo;s technically a cloud OS, but give me a break. I think Chome is a gorgeous operating system, but Google is really missing what people want from a device.</p>
<p>$1,300 for a web browser running on a Core i5 chip and 4 GB of <span class="caps">RAM</span>. You have to be kidding me.</p>
<p>For the 100th time, Chrome OS /= a web browser.</p>
<p>except it is.</p>
<p>Really, they could only get 4gbs of <span class="caps">RAM</span> in this thing? Gosh darn them.</p>
<p>I keep thinking if it was for 600-700$ with 128gb ssd, 16:9 with all day batterylife and maybe offer win8 drivers if u want to dualboot. that would be the perfect none apple laptop</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get tired of seeing content.  You know what I like?  Backdrop. Backdrop as far as the eye can see.  Whether it&rsquo;s a muted gray, a gentle gradient, a muted pattern or an animated gif, I need to see more backdrop.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>16:9 &ndash; because content sucks</strong></p>
<p>anyone noticed the lack of usb 3.0?</p>
<p>None of the Chromebooks have it.. maybe Chrome OS doesn&rsquo;t support it yet</p>
<p>uh yes they do. My chromebook has it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/chrome-os-devices/XE303C12-H01US-specs" target="_blank">http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/chrome-os-devices/XE303C12-H01US-specs</a></p>
<p>Ohh okay I stand corrected</p>
<p>Or for $200 more you can buy a retina MacBook Pro with full OS, almost the same resolution, double the <span class="caps">RAM</span> and four times the drive space. Yeah it doesn&rsquo;t have the touchscreen but the OS X is not made for it &hellip; just like the Chrome OS.</p>
<p>Or a multitude of ultrabooks.   OR <span class="caps">ANYTHING</span>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so confused.</p>
<p>or for a hundred less, a zenbook touch. the only thing the pixel would win at is resolution.</p>
<p>So at least some part of Google realizes that 16:9 sucks. Can we get a 4:3 Nexus, please?</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 and 10 aren&rsquo;t 16:9&hellip;</p>
<p>3:2 aspect ratio screen fail, and price fail.<br />
Also, with bad/no internet connection it essentially becomes a really expensive paperweight :P</p>
<p>3:2 aspect ratio is great</p>
<p>Everything but price is great about this device</p>
<p>If this were half the price, it&rsquo;d be great.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re charging by the pixel!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take a Glass at that price, but not a Chromebook.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the weight of this odd device?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You get the feel of a luxury car door opening and closing,&rdquo; says Pichai.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is the tech world just stealing each other&rsquo;s hyperbole nowadays?</p>
<p>Just Google</p>
<p>So if I order this, Will I get my money back like with the Nexus Q?!?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>Other than brand loyalty or ideological preferences, I can&rsquo;t see how is this any better than a McBook air!? I mean.. 1200 for a only internet device with limited software library!? why!?</p>
<p>How am I suppose to work on that? no dreamweaver, no monodevlop!? an I have to pay 1200 dlls &hellip; Common Google.</p>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s going berserk about the price, when that&rsquo;s not really the point. Yeah, the price is bananas, but the point is to give them to developers at I/O and establish Chrome as a potentially premium OS. And if they sell a few, well, that&rsquo;s gravy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, you must be blind. IT&rsquo;S A <span class="caps">WEB</span> <span class="caps">BROWSER</span>. <span class="caps">WEB</span> <span class="caps">BROWSER</span>. <span class="caps">WEB</span> <span class="caps">BROOOOOOOOOOOWSER</span>.</p>
<p>chrome OS =/ web browser&hellip;<br />
that said it&rsquo;s too expensive.  However wait until a macbook air comes out with retina display and see how expensive <span class="caps">THAT</span> will be.</p>
<p>The hardware looks good. If it came with a full OS, the price would be totally reasonable. But&hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t have anything against Chrome OS. It&rsquo;s supposed to be a stripped down OS for the masses. Putting it into a premium-priced product doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to me.</p>
<p>This could just be a marketing tactic, though. The hardware is pretty sexy, and it might get a decent amount of attention. People might see it and think &ldquo;that&rsquo;s cool, I&rsquo;d buy that if it were way cheaper&rdquo;&hellip; at which point they&rsquo;d find all the other Chromebooks and might pull the trigger.</p>
<p>Sorry&hellip;it&rsquo;s a pretend OS</p>
<p>You haven&rsquo;t used it. You are talking out of your ass.</p>
<p>why isn&rsquo;t it available in 16:9?</p>
<p>Because&hellip;.if you are primarily using the web browser, there is more content vertically than horizontally.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t know if I can ever laugh at Micheal Richards again</p>
<p>Google, you are drunk, go home. Now, if this was a fully functional device that ran Native apps that I need to use on a daily basis <em>and</em> could be used without an internet connection, then this would be an easy buy. But, alas, it is not. I don&rsquo;t see the normal consumer buying this unless they&rsquo;re ignorant of the fact that you can&rsquo;t do much with it.</p>

<p>Laugh now, but I&rsquo;ll bet you that in a year Google is going to be chomping at <span class="caps">MAC</span> and Windows market share.</p>
<p>You might want to step away from the cool-aid.</p>
<p>Sorry, who&rsquo;s going to buy this exactly?</p>
<p>A $1300 laptop that only runs web apps?</p>
<p>Concept fail!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Year of Chrome!</p>
<p>While I would not call this at all expensieve for such a well constructed machine I am surprised at the price considering the strategy google used when pricing the other nexus products.</p>
<p>The phone and tablet were positively cheap and priced at break even points with the philosophy that it was just a vehicle to get android into as many hands as possible. If that was the case here I can&rsquo;t imagine that the break even price would have been much more than &pound;700 not &pound;1000.</p>
<p>I do like that Google is getting into beautiful designs and (mostly) premium materials.  I don&rsquo;t like the price and the low expected battery life.  Quick Question: Where&rsquo;s the <span class="caps">HDMI</span> out port?</p>
<p>They went the same route as the Macbooks (Unfortunately). With the mini display port-out, you&rsquo;d have to get an adapter.</p>
<p>Or&hellip; you know, it&rsquo;s because mini DisplayPort is more capable than <span class="caps">HDMI</span>.</p>
<p>Checks calendar&hellip; Is it April 1st already?!</p>
<p>For whoever wants to go &ldquo;All-in&rdquo; with the cloud, this is the laptop to get&hellip;</p>
<p>Plus, it gives you 1TB of Drive storage for 3 years. At google&rsquo;s price of $49/month for 1TB, that&rsquo;s an $1800 value. If all you wanted was the cloud storage, then it&rsquo;s a no-brainer to buy this.</p>
<p>Or you could buy a $300 laptop that runs real software, sign up for cheap cloud storage and save a fortune!</p>
<p>Did they learn <span class="caps">NOTHING</span> from the Nexus Q?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a bit confused by all the &ldquo;I could get a MacBook or Windows machine for less than this&rdquo; people.</p>
<p>I thought we were in a &ldquo;post-PC era&rdquo; where Windows and OS X were destined to be replaced by iPads and other thin clients like this Chromebook, right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit surreal to see the Usual Suspects for that line mocking the Chromebook&rsquo;s tech specs next to those awful, nasty PCs that are &ldquo;part of the past.&rdquo; :)</p>
<p>yes yes google you did it. now rip off imac and also surface hardware.</p>
<p>And Panos&rsquo; lines, too.</p>
<p>I wonder where is it made</p>
<p>Ok.. wait for it.. Piece of crap.. period.. I&rsquo;d rather buy a Surface Pro with that pesky battery life which clearly justifies the price that this device just doesn&rsquo;t.. You&rsquo;ve got 239 ppi? Ha! So what? You don&rsquo;t even need that on the web right now..</p>
<p>1TB of Drive storage is 50$ monthly. So this package includes 1TB indefinitely ? Not bad.</p>
<p>(would wish Google Fiber came in the package though)</p>
<p>Will be a sweet gift at the IO2013.</p>
<p>3 years is not indefinitely.</p>
<p>Missed that totally. I&rsquo;d kinda expect it because of the price and the novelty of this thing.</p>
<p>Google had a good run with new videos of Google Glass, Nexus 4, updated Google Now, renewed design, Maps, etc. etc. and now they go and fuck it up by releasing this. Like wtf? They did the same shit with Nexus Q. Just when you think Google is dominating, they do something that leaves you scratching your head. Who is approving projects like Nexus Q and Chromebook Pixel?</p>
<p>I would be absolutely shocked if this thing sells more than 10.</p>
<p>Come on Google, seriously? $1,300? I really wanted a google built chromebook. But this was a huge let down. I wanted a google built google tv too but I was also let down earlier this year. Google has let me down twice this year.</p>
<p>I figure they&rsquo;ll dogfood the hell out of these. These will be an alternative to the standard laptops for Google employees. They&rsquo;ll be &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; to use these instead. And it&rsquo;ll probably work for a lot of what they do: development, collaboration, etc. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s good for the general consumer. Google can afford to do this. Joe Blow can&rsquo;t.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google&rsquo;s also including a full 1TB of Google Drive storage, per user, for three years, in the Chromebook Pixel&rsquo;s price.bq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A) I don&rsquo;t need 1TB of storage on a Chromebook. What do you use it for besides the internet and docs? Is there even a torrent client? I can&rsquo;t install my 200+ GB of Windows games&hellip;</p>
<p>B) Included in the price, by force? Gee thanks, no wonder your shit is too expensive.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FYI</span> at $50/mo for three years that is $1800, so it is obviously discounted, but it is also obviously a large part of this ridiculous price.</p>
<p>What would you even download with a torrent client? Can this read DivX movies?</p>
<p>DOA. Overpriced laptop with undercooked OS.</p>
<p>If you can sideload ubuntu on this i&rsquo;m kinda tempted.</p>
<p>32Gb storage&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be better of buying a <span class="caps">MBA</span>, except for the retina quality display.</p>
<p>Makes the 13" rMBP seem like a good deal in comparison.</p>
<p>200$ more for a full desktop OS, twice the <span class="caps">RAM</span>, 4 times the storage, dual video output, <span class="caps">USB</span> 3.0&hellip;<br />
Even neglecting the fact that it runs Chrome OS, it&rsquo;s a bad deal hardware-wise.</p>
<p>Why is it &pound;100 more in the UK?</p>
<p>The Chromebook just became even more pointless.</p>
<p>It was always a questionable value proposition to begin with. Why burden yourself to only being cloud?<br />
To save $200? And definitely not much weight gains given ultrabooks and macbook air&hellip;<br />
But at this price point&hellip; #%^!?!</p>
<p>HD 4000 seriously?<br />
MacbookPro 13: 2560 &times; 1600 = 4 Mio pixels<br />
Bad review score because of graphic performance. Even fast scrolling in a browser doesn&rsquo;t always work.</p>
<p>Chromebook Pixel: 2560 &times; 1700 = 4.3 Mio pixels<br />
More pixels, same HD 4000 graphics.<br />
You did not learned anything Google, right?</p>
<p>The Apple driver for the HD4000 sucks big time&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d certainly need to have your head in the clouds to put down that kind of money on what amounts to little more than a web browser.</p>
<p>This is terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s a hair thicker than the MacBook Air,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not in the photos, that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>I thought it would be about 600 or 700 bucks because Google sells hardware at cost. Apparently things have changed.</p>
<p>$1300 for a browser? This is terrible! Why don&rsquo;t they just slap it with Android and call it a day???</p>
<p>If this ran Android, I would buy it. As it is, it does much, much less than Android, so the price point is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Should have been 500-600 max. I really wanted to buy a nice chrome book from Google but cannot justify this price.</p>
<p>OK, can we install Windows 8 on this? Maybe a Hackintosh for those who prefer that?</p>
<p>It would make sense to buy it then.</p>
<p>Is Chrome OS optimized for touch? If that&rsquo;s the direction Google is taking it, what will happen to the cheap Chromebooks without touch?</p>
<p>oh good i&rsquo;m glad i could come to this comments section and not be the only one who instantly saw this and thought</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, google completely missed the point of it&rsquo;s Chromebook line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buy iPad 4 and brydge + for 719 $ instead. Better performance, better battery life, better touch optimization&hellip; nuff said!</p>
<p>The price seems about right as far as a premium laptop goes. I&rsquo;m just not sure why I would buy it over a Surface or a 13" Macbook Pro Retina. Whether you are in the Microsoft camp or the Apple camp, its fairly obvious that both of those operating systems offer more than just a browser.</p>
<p>Except premium laptops have quality 128 or 256GB SSDs, not 32 :(</p>
<p>If you think about it, most doubls in storage for flash storage are $100, so with 256gb Google might charge $1600</p>
<p>I knew they would screw up with the pricing again. Google never gets how to price a &ldquo;new&rdquo; type of product the first time. This should&rsquo;ve been a $500-$600 device with a quad core Cortex A15, not a $1300 with Core i5. Jesus, Google!</p>
<p>Exactly right, I have the current <span class="caps">ARM</span> Chromebook and its performance is fine. I&rsquo;ve also got it running Ubuntu :) Fanless and long lasting is clearly the way forward, all I want is a better screen and build quality.</p>
<p>If this had a quad core A15 (and yet still more storage) with the same battery it&rsquo;d be able to last for maybe 10+ hours. And be pretty much my ideal machine, at $600 ish.</p>

<p>I love how ignorant Google is, cant believe they think people other than die hard Google fans will buy this junk for its price when they can buy all the Windows 8 gear or a nice decent Macbook Air. As far as I know, an iPad is more productive than this crap.</p>
<p>A whole new level of fail.</p>
<p>Are Google <em>ever</em> going to do anything profitable aside from ad sales from search, like, ever? No? Oh, OK.</p>
<p><span class="caps">AOL</span> 2.0</p>
<p>Totally agree. This is a waste of Google&rsquo;s resources. Then again, they just want to compete with Microsoft on every level. Just look at the history of their products.</p>
<p>A history of their products is a history of failing at things. At least Microsoft make actual money from actual products.</p>
<p>the investors disagree.</p>
<p>what do investors have to do with this? as long as they make money from ads investors will be happy. so? read my comments again.</p>
<p>Also, investors liked <span class="caps">AOL</span> in 2000. But <span class="caps">AOL</span> failed to do anything successful outside its core business of walled-garden dial-up, and once they were out-innovated in their core business, it was all over. Ring any bells? Are you sure Google will never be out-innovated in search? <span class="caps">AOL</span> investors were sure in 2000. I remember a Morgan Stanley research presentation from 2000 entitled &ldquo;<span class="caps">AOL</span>-Time Warner: Back Up Your Truck&rdquo;. lol. That is why I said <span class="caps">AOL</span> 2.0. Do you get it now? Investing is about <em>predicting</em>, it is about the future, not the present.</p>
<p>Ok, you are quite uneducated. The investors only invest in their search and ad business. Without that business, Google does not have <span class="caps">ANY</span> money to waste making these failed projects like Chromebooks and Google+. The successful products that they have literally make them near no money. If they do, it is all 100% tied into ads.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s investor&rsquo;s know it has no competition for ads, so they invest. Not because they believe things like the Nexus Q and Chromebooks are cash cows. They invest because the company dominates in its field of work. On the other hand, Microsoft has a whole league of products that bring in their own profits, not all tied to Bing Ads or something (that does not even exist). The second that a company becomes the leader in online ads (meaning they will also have to be a leader in search), Google is gone for good</p>
<p>I know all the comments say the same thing, but really, given the limitations of ChromeOS, what could I do with this that I can&rsquo;t do with any other Chromebook?  With so many webapps using server side processing, will any experience be faster or better?</p>
<p>The best comparison I can think of is shelling out money for a 4K television and then watching some old <span class="caps">VHS</span> tapes on it.</p>
<p>It looks like a MacBook and a ThinkPad had a baby.</p>
<p>i like the form factor, its like an upgraded cr48</p>
<p>unfortunately they went with that old school HP silver/black combo that Apple uses now too.</p>
<p>its so played, lets go back to black metal or something more interesting please.</p>
<p>also&hellip;everyone is saying this is an unrealistic product because of the price to usability ratio, but apple was in the same boat and they eventually worked it out, i think google can too</p>
<p>Hey Larry, who is making the bad products now? Facebook, or you guys?</p>
<p>I"m sure it isn&rsquo;t a terrible product. Just terribly priced.</p>
<p>But I guess we were all a bit dumb hoping for a retina laptop under a thousand.</p>
<p>or I guess I was at least.</p>
<p>You can get refurb 13" retina for $1269 because of the price drop for new machines&hellip;</p>
<p>Try using this as a real laptop. Then fail. Dude this is a bad product</p>
<p>How? I remember the joke being for the last 4-5 years idiot college kids buying mac book pros just to go on the internet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the primary use scenario for any computing device and it does this perfectly well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with a 12.85-inch, 2560 &times; 1700 touchscreen panel, Google says it&rsquo;s the highest resolution display that&rsquo;s ever shipped on a laptop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 15" rMBP has 2880&times;1800 which is certainly higher than 2560 &times; 1700.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s pixel density that Google&rsquo;s referring to because @ 12.85", it&rsquo;s denser than the 13.3" rMBP by 13ppi (239 vs 226).</p>
<p>For what it&rsquo;s worth, resolution doesn&rsquo;t refer to how many pixels it can display, resolution is a linear measurement (that is, 239 ppi is resolution, 2560&times;1700 is not).</p>
<p>Yes, resolution is number of elements per unit of length (<span class="caps">PPI</span>, <span class="caps">DPI</span>, <span class="caps">PPCM</span>, <span class="caps">PPMM</span>, <span class="caps">LPMM</span>&hellip;).<br />
By the way, thank you for pointing that out, crowds needs some education in this field.</p>
<p>FALSE. &ldquo;The display resolution of a digital television, computer monitor or display device is the number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed.&rdquo; You are confusing resolution with pixel density.</p>
<p>Wow! It&rsquo;s juste like a fat macbook air, without the OS !</p>
<p>If we can hack windows 8 onto this machine, it might be good.</p>
<p>Nope, not the highest resolution laptop.</p>
<p>Those honors go to the Fujitsu U820 and UH900. (What, you thought I was going to say MacBook Pro 15.4"? I understand what &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; means, and it ain&rsquo;t framebuffer size.)</p>
<p>1280&times;800, 5.6", for 270 ppi.</p>
<p>Wow that price for that functionality&hellip; I think it would be a stretch for most people to pay $399 for a chromebook considering that it is nothing but a web browser.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s really funny: almost all the &ldquo;software&rdquo; that this thing will run shows ads.</p>
<p>Haha</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never ever see another pixel in your life,&rdquo; says Chrome VP Sundar Pichai.</p>
<p>Even the Chrome VP doesn&rsquo;t seem to believe these will sell!</p>
<p>Even dumber buy than macbook.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how a Macbook is very dumb&hellip; Mac Pro, maybe.</p>
<p>The fact that Google green lit this and the Q makes you wonder what projects they have worked on which haven&#8217;t made it to production</p>
<p>this is the best looking laptop available</p>
<p>put a better distro of linux on there and you&rsquo;ve got an incredible machine</p>
<p>This is proof positive that Apple&rsquo;s industrial design abilities go far beyond &ldquo;just make it a metal rectangle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to buy one of these, and Google is likely to lose quite a bit of money on this particular product because I doubt they will sell enough to sniff profits.  That&rsquo;s ok, they have more money than just about everybody and I think this is part of a larger strategy.</p>
<p>Chromebook Pixel is basically a &ldquo;halo&rdquo; product.  In conjunction with their rumored physical store presence, this will draw people to the store, they will purchase downmarket Chromebooks and use Chrome OS.  Chrome OS gains market share (as the Chrome browser is already doing) as the web replaces desktop apps and Google charges more for advertising on the back of more Google users resulting from the trifecta of Chrome / Chrome OS / Android.  Profit.</p>
<p>Seems like a really nice device.  Too bad they will most likely sell this in the Google Play Store.  Good luck getting support for that expensive laptop fellas.  Oh, and when you need to return it Google will immediately hold the full cost of the replacement on your CC until 15 days after they receive the defective pile of shit they send you.  That is how much they trust their customers.  Other companies only charge <span class="caps">AFTER</span> they haven&rsquo;t received the defective return over 30 days or something.  Not Google, they just assume you are a crook and charge you for the replacement.</p>
<p>Google Play Store support is the worst in the industry.  Can not recommend anyone buy anything from Google.</p>
<p>Also &ndash; commence Google stock jump to $1000 because ___________</p>
<p>No I will not be buying this. I love you Google. I&rsquo;m typing this on a chromebook right now. I have a nexus 4 in my pocket. But just no on this one.</p>
<p>Holy expensive! What happened to google making products affordable? I&rsquo;d rather get a supped up air for that price. It also looks like a 2002 macbook pro. I love the notification light though.</p>
<p>I feel like it all depends on how well they continue to upgrade Chrome OS and integrate it with all of their other services.  The concept of this device makes a lot of sense in theory, but with the current ecosystem they have, I&rsquo;m not entirely sold.</p>
<p>Thats not the point . Chrome OS is a thin client OS and drives on the concept of having everything in the cloud (internet) including its applications . Its for people who wanna do regular stuff eg web browsing , playing flash games and keep up with social network . And thats the market they need to concentrate with sub 300$ devices . I have no idea why would any one spend 1500$ for that when a 199$ device can do the same.</p>
<p>also most people who spend over 1k on laptops use it for productivity . Chrome OS doesnt have , photoshop , native <span class="caps">IDE</span> of any sorts , matlab , autocad etc etc and these are the apps one runs when the spend so much on a laptop.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lot of money up front but if you consider the fact that you&rsquo;re buying a solidly built, high quality, premium device that runs an extremely light, fast and constantly up to date OS (that updates for free in a regular fashion) it really isn&rsquo;t that bad of a deal. I mean, if you buy it next week for $1,300 and, barring any major hardware shifts or compatibility issues, you will essentially have a computer that is just a fast and fresh 5+ years from now as it was the day you bought it. That said, the price is still hard to swallow, pretty much seals the deal in me buying the <span class="caps">ARM</span> Samsung for $250.</p>
<p>If you call someone stupid for buying this then I guess you&rsquo;ll have to call the people who bought ipads super stupid.</p>
<p>Please, continue&hellip;</p>
<p>Look at the mirror</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot to pay for a browser</p>
<p>LMAO. Can&rsquo;t believe Google really think people will buy a browser book when people can get a 13-inch Retina Book or a Samsung Ultrabook for the same / lower price. Not an Apple fanboy but Google, this is not how you compete with companies like Apple and Microsoft.</p>
<p>I was expecting an <span class="caps">ARM</span> powered Laptop, no something with a fan<br /><span class="caps">WTF</span> with the pice: screen is below 13 inches, Chrome OS is far from done, HD4000 cannot handle well those resolutions.</p>
<p>My god this is such a bad purchase I&rsquo;m fairly certain I&rsquo;ll end getting one somehow. Such is my karma.</p>
<p>You must have screwed with some serious bitches to earn such karma !</p>
<p>I say this is their pump-fake.  Premium arm version is coming&hellip;. You know you want it, but can&rsquo;t buy it cause it&rsquo;s too expensive.  Soon enough Sundar&rsquo;s gonna be on stage and be all like, &ldquo;Bam! Now you Bitches can afford it! Check out this arm version with better battery for half the price!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the only way this makes sense. It&rsquo;s a crazy halo item that they know no one will buy, but at least it&rsquo;s more functional than the Nexus Q.</p>
<p>Unveil a Tegra 4 version for $500-600 at I/O and we&rsquo;ll go bonkers.</p>
<p>Your idea actually makes sense</p>
<p>I guess its something they can put in their potential store.</p>
<p>Whatever man&hellip;..Google&rsquo;s gone crazy! I guess they need something to sell in those new stores!?</p>

	<li>For everyone else&hellip; I guess we can hope for an affordable Tegra version at I/O.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, so they call it the Pixel and give it a very hi-res (touch)screen.<br />
What&rsquo;s it for then? <br />
Well, the web (mostly) isn&rsquo;t hi-res. Native apps? Nope, it&rsquo;s on Chrome OS, obviously.<br />
Media consumption? More, likely, if Chrome OS and the Android are somewhat merged (meaning that the Play Store and Chrome Web store would be too). SO <span class="caps">WHY</span> <span class="caps">DID</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GENIUSES</span> (intentionally ironic grammatical error) AT <span class="caps">GOOGLE</span> <span class="caps">GIVE</span> IT A 12.85" <span class="caps">SCREEN</span>? And a dodgy (3:2) aspect ratio.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;hair thicker&rdquo; than a MacBook Air? Might want to rethink that sentence.</p>
<p>take the top off and maybe <strong>then</strong> it&rsquo;s a hair thicker&hellip;and still</p>
<p>macbook is a curved design.</p>
<p>Dude&hellip;</p>
<p>Appearances can be decieving. The Air is like a dome, top and bottom&hellip;. It appears to be floating off the table, and makes the Chromebook float&hellip; but it&rsquo;s just <span class="caps">THAT</span> thick.</p>
<p>This laptop is 2 times thicker than the <span class="caps">THICKEST</span> part of the air.</p>
<p>When they say &ldquo;hair&rdquo; they mean rasta dreadlocks.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">MBA</span> is tapered. It gives the illusion of being thin.</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">HUNDREDS</span> hair strings thicker would do it though.</p>
<p>Woah!</p>
<p>Yeah, Ron Jeremy&rsquo;s pubic hair.</p>
<p>It is new Google elephant hair&hellip;</p>
<p>Wow. And the people have bitched about Apple&rsquo;s pricing all this time should be bitching about this. $1299 for a laptop with a browser based OS?! Are they dreaming?! Does it come with drugs that convince you it&rsquo;s a good purchase too?</p>
<p>Uh&hellip;I think you&rsquo;ll find in this thread:  they <span class="caps">ARE</span> bitching.  Quite a lot, actually.</p>
<p>Google Tax</p>
<p>Na people have the balls to bitch about Surface Pro. I bet people will be a little more sensable now that this crap beats the shit out of the Surface Pro in price and nothing else.</p>
<p>Step 1: Buy nice Thinkpad for less than this. <br />
Step 2: Install Ubuntu with GNOME3<br />
Step 3: Install Chrome. <br />
Step 4: <span class="caps">PROFIT</span>!</p>
<p><span class="caps">KDE</span> &gt; <span class="caps">GNOME</span>. openSUSE &gt; Ubuntu. Thinkpad is nice though.</p>
<p>To each their own. <span class="caps">KDE</span> is bloated crap, and I left years of OpenSUSE for Ubuntu. I <span class="caps">HATE</span> .rpm-based distros.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so disappointed.. :(</p>
<p>Only on price but still. There&rsquo;s no chance I would buy one now.</p>
<p>Me too. A premium $500 Chromebook would have been absolutely awesome and completely disruptive in the low-end PC market.</p>
<p>(Nexus 10 + Keyboard &ndash; Apps)*(3 Times cost) = Chromebook Pixel</p>
<p>This comment thread has been a great big trainwreck full of lulz.</p>
<p>I love Google but just no&#8230;</p>
<p>I love Google but that price makes no sense.</p>
<p>Article has a couple of things wrong, &ldquo;For the first time in a Chromebook, specs have been improved: with a Core i5 processor &mdash; rather than an <span class="caps">ARM</span> or Intel Atom chip &mdash; as well Intel HD 4000 graphics and 4GB of <span class="caps">RAM</span>,&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have a Samsung series 5 550 Chromebook. It has a dual core Celeron, not an Atom or <span class="caps">ARM</span>. It has 4GB of ram. It has Intel HD graphics, not sure about the 4000 part.</p>
<p>I just got my Chromebook a couple of weeks ago, so I&rsquo;m not ready to run out and get an updated version. But, if I were looking after my experienses so far, I would be seriously considering this.</p>
<p>Weird. I&rsquo;m happy to spend that much on a quality notebook, but I expect decent battery life and more importantly a real operating system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Google says it&rsquo;s the highest resolution display that&rsquo;s ever shipped on a laptop.&rdquo; Google obviously isn&rsquo;t aware of the 2880&times;1800 in the 15" rMBP.</p>
<p>Anyway, nice to see a good bit of hardware design out there, pity about the OS. Oops, sorry, pity about the browser. Forgot its not an OS.</p>
<p>This should have more hard drive space in it, ship with windows, and have a quick boot to chrome option.</p>
<p>The only other way to justify the price is if it had the battery last multiple days on one charge. I&rsquo;m willing to pay a premium on things, but what I get for the price just simply isn&rsquo;t worth it. I&rsquo;ll just buy a Macbook Pro with retina and have a couple less pixels.</p>
<p>Thumbs up to your idea, add 256gb ssd and windows dual boot and it would actually almost be worth it then.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t understand why google isn&rsquo;t licensing it out for that feature.</p>
<p>Macbook  Fail</p>
<p>That is a very, very strange product decision&hellip;</p>
<p>I seriously have no clue how this will ever sell, fairly unknown, early and not so versatile OS. 32gb of storage at that price point where almost anything else would be around a 256gb <span class="caps">SSD</span> (this is most likely not even an <span class="caps">SSD</span> either) Literally the only good thing about it is the screen but seriously, I&rsquo;ve us a W700 with an 11.6 inch 1080p screen and the resolution just didn&rsquo;t make a great difference, half of the time it hindered if anything, as i had to enlarge all my font (not that I wouldn&rsquo;t take it over a 720p screen).</p>
<p>That much for a glorified web browser with a metal wrapper. Huh.</p>
<p>IT <span class="caps">COMES</span> <span class="caps">WITH</span> 1tb oc cloud stourage, only usb 2.0</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;&rsquo;t pay for more $499.00, even at that i would cringe at spending that money on a laptop with an OS that is basically the Chrome browser.</p>
<p>ya 500-700 would be a faire price point</p>
<p>So&hellip;very&hellip;expensive. Put Windows 8 on it and it would still be overpriced. It&rsquo;s a web browser, for goodness sake! I wouldn&rsquo;t pay $600 for it!</p>
<p>The Apple Macintosh sold in 1984 for $2495 (not accounting for inflation). They sold 70k of them.</p>
<p>Whose complaining about price, vs ingenuity, vs Think Different, now?</p>
<p>Back then the Macintosh was a real computer. This is absolutely not.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning. Something big is going to happen at Google I/O and all will be clear. If I could install Eclipse this would be the perfect dev machine. All that gorgeous screen space in a small package.</p>
<p>Dat fingerless glove</p>
<p>Equivalent to $1600 in UK Play Store!?</p>
<p>This is a relatively nice box.  However, it totally goes against the economical Chrome Book concept.  I suppose Google wanted one really nice box out there&hellip;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a browser when all is said and done.  They should do a dual boot with Windows.  This would be a great Windows 8 laptop and with the dual boot (with a 128 GB <span class="caps">SSD</span> update), it might sell well.</p>
<p>PC makers do shitty trackpads.  My Macbook is a great trackpad.  This one appears to be really good.  It could be a good selling point for a Windows 8 box.</p>
<p>If you just assume that you can put Ubuntu on this, it becomes way more amazing.  It has pretty good hardware (amazing screen) and the price is competitive with a Macbook.</p>
<p>One caveat is that one might have to use <span class="caps">KDE</span> for <span class="caps">DPI</span> reasons.</p>
<p>This Apple fanboy is thrilled to see Google aiming high with design and quality.  The Pixel is obviously not a product for a casual user but it is gorgeous and it is a bold move.   And like the original Macbook Air has shown you gotta start somewhere with the price.   Less expensive products will come later.</p>
<p>Google really seems to be firing on all cylinders.  Opening their own stores to show off their native hardware and software experiences is a fantastic idea.  Get Samsung and Verizon out of the way and I&rsquo;m all in on Android.</p>
<p>So does anyone see this as a clear message the next release of Android or of Chrome OS will at some level unify the two operating systems?</p>
<p>It makes sense&hellip;combine the best of the two platforms and work towards a unified ecosystem.</p>
<p>May just be that Android 5.0 will have some sort of emulator for Chrome OS so you can run Android apps inside a browser&hellip;</p>
<p>But will it play crysis 3?</p>
<p>Srly tho, 1k for desktop gaming PC + 300 for a cool tablet (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_32gb_hspa_att" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_32gb_hspa_att</a>) and call it a day.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know who to believe with regards to the Touchscreen&rsquo;s responsiveness: the Verge, which has no hands-on review, or Engadget, which does have a hands-on review. Engadget is showing the device and says that the touchscreen is capable (which the video proves out). Seems like it&rsquo;s another case where The Verge gets a janky review unit and Engadget gets the juiced one.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WHY</span> <span class="caps">COULDNT</span> <span class="caps">THEY</span> <span class="caps">MAKE</span> A <span class="caps">MID</span> <span class="caps">RANGE</span> <span class="caps">CHROMEBOOK</span>,,!!!!!!! <span class="caps">NOOO</span></p>
<p>Does it cost that much because it was made in America?</p>
<p>I love this hardware. As a confirmed 16:9 hater, I love it even more! All it needs to ship with is an Ubuntu <span class="caps">DVD</span>.</p>
<p>If I can put ordinary desktop Linux on it and it&#8217;s as nice a piece of hardware as it sounds, then it sounds at least a little attractive. Any thing&#8217;s hard at that price though.</p>
<p>I really wish Google built a desktop OS that supported Adobe&rsquo;s Creative Suite. The path Windows is going down is bad, they need better competition &bull; Apple will always be marketed as a premium. Android is a pretty damn good OS, bring the simplicity of Android and take those elements to form a full fledged OS. Yeah it will take a long time but definitely worth it in the long run. I don&rsquo;t see a future of cloud only, privacy, security, upload speeds etc.</p>
<p>I am waiting for the Surface 2 and Surface ProBook that will announced in June or maybe earlier than that. Microsoft&rsquo;s new iteration of the Surface is going to shit on everyone iPad and all on thinness, power, and versatility..</p>

<p>I think this is pretty huge and MS and Apple are not feeling good about this at all. I&rsquo;m writing this on an X1 Carbon, pretty much the same hardware specs, for the same price, but a much lesser screen and I&rsquo;m thinking: whenever am I using this machine when I&rsquo;m not online? Answer: pretty much never. So OK, bring the cost down and make sure 90% of the most used apps are available from the cloud and I dont&rsquo;t see any reason why this would not become the next wave in computing. I&rsquo;m not saying next year. But give it 3-5 years and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we&rsquo;re looking at a similar shift as what Android (and <span class="caps">IOS</span>) has achieved. Just look at Mary Meekers report on OS share of Internet connected devices: WinTel went down from 90% to 35% in just five years. This is scaring the shit out of the &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; players (<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/windows-has-fallen-behind-apple-ios-and-google-android-7000008699/)" target="_blank">http://www.zdnet.com/windows-has-fallen-behind-apple-ios-and-google-android-7000008699/)</a>.</p>
<p>Way too expensive&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="caps">LOL</span> yeah they are not feeling good at all becoz their stomach is hurting from all that laughing. $1300.- for this device is like a kick in the stomach (of the consumer, not Microsoft or Apple).</p>
<p>If Google wants to compete on cost at the high-end, they will lose to Apple and Microsoft. That is not the strategy to take. And comparing this to Android is downright silly. The ChomeBook is not the next wave of computing (unlike the touch enabled smartphone and tablet) &ndash; it is merely trying to evolve an existing established category, there is no disruption here just evolution. And currently they are doing a bad job of it. Simple question: Why would I buy this ChromeBook over a MacBook Air or a Surface <span class="caps">PRO</span> 128GB? And saying it will only get better is not good enough becoz neither Apple nor Microsoft will be sitting still either.</p>
<p>I think pretty much the reason Google made this is so they can take the crown for world&rsquo;s highest resolution laptop from Apple.  I don&rsquo;t understand why anyone wouldn&rsquo;t just get a 13" rMBP over this.  Plus, the rMBP is $200 more for 4x the storage space and a far more capable OS.  I think Google just wanted to one up Apple in regards to the display, but not give a flying fuck about the actual product.</p>
<p>I see the problem&hellip;.from the google ts and cs</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pricing Mistakes</p>
<p>We try very hard to make sure there are no mistakes in the prices that appear on the site. In the unlikely event that a mistake happens you agree that Google will not be bound by that incorrect price, unless your credit card, debit card or other payment method in your Google Wallet account has already been charged. If a mistake is discovered and you haven&rsquo;t been charged yet, we will let you know the correct price and you will be given the option to continue with your order at the correct price or cancel it."</p>
<p>1200 for non-<span class="caps">IPS</span> screen and only 32gb hard drive?  Yeah &hellip; No thanks.  A Nexus 10 with a keyboard dock can probably do the same thing as this device at less than half the price.</p>
<p>Where does it say non-<span class="caps">IPS</span>? Can&rsquo;t think of any TN panels with such resolutions. Even Retina Macbooks have <span class="caps">IPS</span>-displays.</p>
<p>it has quite bad viewing angles, check verge hands on. worst product execution ever</p>
<p>A Nexus 10 can do a lot more actually. For one, it can run apps that are not called &ldquo;Chrome&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While I like the other chromebooks that price point is just too high for what they are offering. No <span class="caps">USB</span> 3.0 and 5 hour battery.  I am really interested to see what Google is thinking in doing this.</p>
<p>Why do you need <span class="caps">USB</span> 3.0 when you have Dual Band 802.11N&hellip; It&rsquo;s not like youll be pluging <span class="caps">USB</span> sticks to this very often.</p>
<p><span class="caps">USB</span> 3.0 is useful for lots more uses besides a wifi dongle.</p>
<p>That said, Chrome OS is limited with hardware support.</p>
<p>My point is that its on the $250 chromebook from Samsung. But not the $1300 chromebook from Google. Makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not that impressive. But it&rsquo;s an alright first entry for Google into the high-end notebook market. Sadly, the nice hardware just emphasizes the mediocre software.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not even nice hardware really. It&rsquo;s a beautifully designed chassis with a top-of-the-line screen. Everything else is middling to average hardware wise.</p>
<p>a screen with narrow viewing angles is not top of the line</p>
<p>And I though the Microsoft Surface Pro was overpriced :D Google is out of their mind, this is the most expensive and yet useless device ever made,</p>
<p>And people complain about Apple&rsquo;s prices. For $200 more, you get a 13.3" rMBP with nearly as many pixels, a faster full-voltage processor, 2 hours better battery life, twice the <span class="caps">RAM</span>, twice the storage, an OS with real applications, 2 <span class="caps">USB</span> 3.0 ports, Bluetooth 4.0, <span class="caps">HDMI</span> and 2 Thunderbolt ports. Sure there&rsquo;s no touchscreen, but touch seems more like a gimmick with a traditional notebook (it makes more sense on a convertible notebook or tablet design like the Surface).</p>
<p>Just so I have this straight:<br />
They made a premium laptop meant to provide the best cloud experience possible with a 3:2 screen because most websites scroll vertically?<br />
Then they give you 1tb of storage in the cloud for all your pictures and movies.</p>
<p>Almost every phone and camera shoot 720p or 1080p widescreen video and pictures. People also spend a lot of time on YouTube or video sites watching content that was created in 16:9.</p>
<p>How does using a 3:2 screen make any sense in that kind of world. There are going to be huge amounts of letter boxing on an already smallish screen when viewing multimedia.  This makes no sense.</p>
<p>I really was feeling like google was on a roll lately but this is just a turd! They should hide this destroy this thing immediately.</p>
<p>My camera shoots 3:2 pictures. Isn&rsquo;t that a regular ratio on camera&rsquo;s? Or otherwise 4:3.</p>
<p>Someone her on the Verge suggested a premium Chromebook a while back. Guess he got his wish. Good luck with that.</p>
<p>for $600. this is 2x the price</p>
<p>Can it run Crysis</p>
<p>According to my conversion, Pixel is &ldquo;thinner than&rdquo; <span class="caps">MBA</span>, its the tapered edges of the <span class="caps">MBA</span> that give the &ldquo;illusion&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s thinner. One could argue that the <span class="caps">MBA</span> &ldquo;volume&rdquo; is less. Pixel is heavier though.</p>
<p>13&rdquo; <span class="caps">MBA</span>:<br />
Height: 0.11-0.68 inch<br />
Width: 12.8 inches<br />
Depth: 8.94 inches<br />
Weight: 2.96 pounds</p>
<p>Chromebook Pixel<br />
297.7 &times; 224.6 &times; 16.2 mm Converted To Inches:<br />

<p>Why compare&hellip;one is a device that is actually useful and one is something else&hellip;</p>
<p>Hey now, I&rsquo;m sure that <strong>Macbooks</strong> are still useful to <em>some</em> people.</p>
<p>Why would I buy this over a Surface <span class="caps">PRO</span> 128GB &ndash; this ChromeBook is heavier, half the memory, none of the ecosystem and very few of the capabilities apart from being more expensive and less portable. And even if I don&rsquo;t want a Surface <span class="caps">PRO</span>, I would get a MacBook Air over this. No wonder Ballmer was chuckling derisively last week &ndash; I guess he knew what Google was launching today.</p>
<p>There is no reason to buy this unless you work for Google and in that case one would hope they would give it away to you for free</p>
<p>Wow.<br />
And it&rsquo;s a blatant <span class="caps">MBP</span> ripoff too.<br />
Hilarious. Why isn&rsquo;t anyone even trying to make an original laptop design anymore?</p>
<p>Is it too much to ask for Google to make their own 11" or 14" Chromebook, with <span class="caps">ARM</span> or Tegra innards, that has 10-12 hours of battery life and only costs $149-199? I don&rsquo;t need or want a retina touchscreen on a laptop powered by an i5 processor, especially one running ChromeOS.</p>
<p>Chromebooks themselves are a niche product at the moment, and making one that costs a chunk over $1000 isn&rsquo;t going to help it break into the mainstream. Sure the specs are impressive, but for what ChromeOS offers, this is a woefully terrible deal for any adopter.</p>
<p>You can get a fully loaded iPad (Retina Display, 128 GB hard disk, <span class="caps">LTE</span>, bluetooth keyboard) for about $1,000&hellip; And it will have tens of thousands of optimized apps with app support well into the future. The comparable device here is over $1,400 with only 32 GB of storage&hellip; Not seeing the value in some of these high end competitors to iPad / ultrabooks / laptops</p>
<p>Love it. Thinking of getting one. Chrome is the perfect OS for me, web browsing and Google Docs is all I do. If it means I can use it in a premium case and a beautiful screen, why not? People might be happy with their cheap Chromebooks but why can&#8217;t some of us who use it, have a premium option?</p>
<p>Why not just buy a MacBook for the same price and run ChromeOS off an SD card or <span class="caps">USB</span> drive then?</p>
<p>you are such a fanboy. just buy a premium laptop and install chrome on it. Anyone who buys this crap is retarded.</p>
<p>Got nothing to do with being a fanboy, how about I like it and want to use it? What I spend my money on is up to me! Why would I buy a macbook? Apple won&#8217;t get a penny of my money, ever!!! Sit your asses down &#8220;Fanboys&#8221;.</p>
<p>Can you name one that isn&rsquo;t a Macbook?</p>
<p>I think this review has the word Apple more than it does Chromebook.  Can you guys just review the unit without mentioning Apple.  I dont see what this laptop has in common with the Air at all!  Just review the pros and cons of this thing.  It looks interesting on many levels, but the price might be a bit much.</p>
<p>It would be hard since the competitor for this is the Air and various Ultrabooks.  As this is not a review I don&rsquo;t see your point?</p>
<p>this price sure made surface affordable</p>
<p>Lets just Guess the EU Price which probably is around 1400&euro; which should mean 2000$ in Sweden!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo;<br /><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35215630.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The OS to me seems a bit far from my personal use, also too expensive for what its capable of&#8230;</p>
<p>Just proves what an awesome deal the surface pro is&hellip;.if the verge rates the surface pro 7.5 this pixel thing should be around 4 max</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll never see another pixel in your life&rdquo;<br />
Rarely has more truth been spoken</p>
<p>good one!</p>
<p>3:2 aspect ratio?  Good buy viewing 2 windows side by side easily.  I&rsquo;ll take my 16:9 1080p screen, and the ability to easily snap windows side by side.</p>
<p>I thought Chromebooks were supposed to be cheap&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="http://creativebackend.com/pics/ceaser_nope.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><img title="Yeah, right." src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/63202a9f0c50bbcd7974eed898084108/tumblr_milgqffR2q1qj5p39o1_500.png" alt="Yeah, right." /></p>
<p>Touch screen in a laptop &hellip;.. try using that all day. <strong>arm falls off</strong></p>
<p>$1299 for a computer that can only operate on the web? That&rsquo;s a ridiculous pricepoint considering that the Macbook Air 13" and Pro 13" are $100 cheaper. Granted the display on the Pixel seems pretty interesting, high res, touchscreen, and not strictly widescreen, but I think I&rsquo;ll stick with a traditional laptop until the price comes below $1000.</p>
<p>Against a Macbook Pro then, +$100 snags you a retina, <em>touchcreen</em> display. That seems like a really good deal to me.</p>
<p>And when that 32GB of soldered in <span class="caps">NAND</span> memory has worn out, you throw your nice i5 processor, retina display, and 2GB of ram into the trash?</p>
<p>This actually makes the Macbook Pro looks reasonably priced.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NAND</span> doesn&rsquo;t wear out that fast&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://l.wigflip.com/a/BIdmvyPh/roflbot.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>To rip off the Steve Jobs analogy. This is Google trying to charge me for a truck, while selling me a car.</p>
<p>Got a chuckle, thanks. :-)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a Rolls Royce golf cart. Very nice and expensive, but you still can&rsquo;t do any real driving with it.</p>
<p>This seems genuinely insane.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great device for Windows 8, actually. Put there a Windows button and I&rsquo;m in.</p>
<p>A perfect machine for productivity tasks.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s that you say, I can&rsquo;t run either Visual Studio or Eclipse or Photoshop in a browser? The screen is outstanding but there&rsquo;s no use for them in a regular web page.</p>
<p>Why would anybody pay the premium for a Lamborghini, if you have to drive it with flat tires?</p>
<p>Add this to crapgadgets</p>
<p>This is the nicest laptop I&rsquo;ve seen since, well, forever.</p>
<p>Chrome OS currently does almost everything I would need it to. Sadly, not all of it. Yet. That day will come though, I&rsquo;m confident Google will get there soon.</p>
<p>Is it just me or does the screen on this totally look like 4:3 or something??</p>
<p>Not only is the $1300 Chrome book cheaper than the equivalent $1000 Windows laptop, unlike the Windows laptop, I don&rsquo;t have to relearn everything and convert all my data to the cloud.</p>
<p>If any of that made sense to you, you are definitely the target customer.</p>
<p>Maybe I don&rsquo;t know enough about Chromebooks, but I do know that Google&rsquo;s vision of the always-there internet connection is somewhat optimistic. I was at a conference last week and they supplied us with wifi, but it was damn-near useless&hellip; and if a Chromebook needs to be connected to do what it does then it would have been useless too. Also, if I have a Windows laptop, or a Mac, or a Surface Pro, or even an iPad or Android tablet I can install the Chrome browser. So why would I need a dedicated Chrome laptop when I could do everything and more with something else? I just don&rsquo;t get it&hellip; but happy to be corrected or educated.</p>
<p>3:2 Aspect ratio? I&rsquo;ll wait for the 1:1 thanks Google.</p>
<p>I would rather have that new asus zenbook touch 1080p thing, or a retina pro, or a 128GB <span class="caps">LTE</span> iPad, or all 3 nexii, or 2 <span class="caps">HTC</span> Ones, or any number of things that can do more than open chrome. $1300 is insane. $1000 would be too much. $750 might be appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>But can you upgrade the <span class="caps">RAM</span> or <span class="caps">SSD</span>?</strong>  All I want to know is if anything is soldered in.  If not, I&rsquo;ll buy it just to tweak it with another operating system.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something cool to think about:  Google is definitely selling the Pixel at cost or even below, just like all of their hardware. Apple&rsquo;s 13 inch <span class="caps">RMBP</span> is definitely bringing in a healthy profit. The <span class="caps">RMBP</span> is also cheaper (for the lowest spec version) than the Pixel and has equal or superior specs for the most part. The one that&rsquo;s $200 more blows Pixel out of the water.</p>
<p>For me this just highlights how ridiculously efficient Apple must be. I don&rsquo;t know why Google thinks they can beat Apple at their game right now (right down to making an Apple-esque product page, but in <span class="caps">BLACK</span> and making Pixel look like a Macbook from Minecraft) but it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s tough to see any company really beating Apple at their own game at this point. Samsung has had some success in mobile but it&rsquo;s come at an enormous advertising and marketing premium. I may never understand how companies can continue to follow Apple&rsquo;s lead so egregiously and hope to eclipse them that way. Apple got to where they are precisely because they looked at the lay of the land and said &ldquo;Okay, we can&rsquo;t win if we make this this or that, but if we tweak the formula and make something more uniquely ours and do a good job at it, then we at least have a shot&rdquo;. So many companies seem to focus on &ldquo;Wow Apple is successful, shoot, how can we make our products more like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google is charging $1,299+ for a web browser and try to sell it as a MacBook knock-off&hellip; Damn, I need to order my new MacBook pro wight now&hellip;</p>
<p>Google wants to make all the profit on Chromebook Pixel it supposedly loses on Nexus 4?</p>
<p>What a steal this is!!!!!!!  $1300 for a browser. Google you rock!</p>
<p>930 comments on The Verge = winning product / marketing strategy</p>
<p>it is more like terrible product became public very fast= humiliation</p>
<p>Not if 90% of those comments are things like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a steal this is!!!!!!! $1300 for a browser. Google you rock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1300$ for a web browser with 5 hours battery life and 32gb storage and 3:2 screen???&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, this machine is a joke. Surface Pro for me. Stick to selling ads Google.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I love Google/Android  but this is way too much money.  This product will flop really hard and should teach Google to never release a product this expensive again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful looking laptop, but I just don&rsquo;t agree with the compromises necessary to make it. Still, it&rsquo;s a solid starting point and I think it indicates that Google is taking hardware more and more seriously, which I like. I think Google is a very talented company that could have a lot to offer if they took hardware more seriously. But really, you&rsquo;re basically better off getting a 13" Macbook Retina unless you need/want ChromeOS for some reason&hellip;</p>
<p>So they name the OS &ldquo;Chrome&rdquo; because <span class="caps">GUI</span> chrome is the one thing they don&rsquo;t want you to see in the software, and they named the computer &ldquo;Pixel&rdquo; because pixels is the one thing they don&rsquo;t want you to see on the screen? I can&rsquo;t tell if their marketing department is being incredibly deep or just your run-of-the-mill stupid.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CLEARLY</span> a luxery item.</p>
<p>?1,300? To look like a MacBook Pro and browse  the web? Oh hell no! What?</p>
<p>This would have been good at $400.<br />
And i thought Google makes money not from hardware but from services..<br />
They just pull out a Joker out of this one, robs and laughs at (not with) you.</p>
<p>I think 600 considering its a bare-bones PC with no operating system. lol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This would have been good at $400.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a breakdown that seems just right,<br />
 Hardware $600.<br />
Online Storage $100.<br />
OS $600.</p>
<p>I paid only $20 for windows 8 an $10 for Office and I thought it was steep.</p>
<p>Ha, this machine is a joke. Surface Pro for me. Stick to selling ads Google.</p>
<p>1300$ for a web browser with 5 hours battery life and 32gb storage and 3:2 screen???</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>The meth problem in the United States has apparently reached epic proportions.  Google, get real. Nothing is more frustrating that watching a race between an invalid and someone who just refuses to win.</p>
<p>I had a feeling the Chromebook was real.  The voice-over artist used in the leaked video everyone was calling a hoax was too good; a voice like that doesn&rsquo;t come free or cheap.  At that price point, though, I&rsquo;m disappointed I was right.</p>
<p>This shit(price) is redonkulous</p>
<p>Guarantee Google makes like 100 of these things so that their &ldquo;sold out&rdquo; for months. I just don&rsquo;t know anyone willing to throw $1,300 away on an also-ran OS.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35230267.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that the Verge wrote that those were things that Apple &ldquo;popularized&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;invented&rdquo; or &ldquo;innovated&rdquo; because those design features began with Sony years before Apple tried them. Problem with Sony is nice designs are often just one or &ldquo;three-offs&rdquo; before they try something else entirely. There&rsquo;s no continuity with innovation when it comes to Sony.</p>
<p>I guess Google looked at its headquarters and saw that everyone had a MacBook. They had to make a browser for them. That&rsquo;s who the audience is.</p>
<p>The Chromebook Pixel&hellip;.brought to you buy the same jokers who gave you this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techfever.net/images/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/google-nexus-q2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Even Google isn&rsquo;t entirely sure what this thing was supposed to do.</p>
<p>If Google had only promoted it by saying &ldquo;spend 50 bucks a month on 1 tb of cloud storage and we&rsquo;ll give a Pixel for free&rdquo; I might have actually spent a hour considering it.</p>
<p><img title="Might as well..." src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AdTojLBR980/T0NreeIqXjI/AAAAAAAALkc/DJg7tRELi_k/s1600/money-drain2.jpg" alt="Might as well..." /></p>
<p>Could the promotional video be any more like an Apple promotional video? I&rsquo;m so glad they want to &lsquo;delight&rsquo; me&hellip; Google, you&rsquo;re just like Microsoft, another Apple wannabe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like a product straight from the tv series The Office.<br />
It&rsquo;s just sooo bad, everybody <del>guffaws</del> lols.</p>
<p>Holy Mother of overpriced white trash first world gadget.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35232896.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Wait so Google isn&rsquo;t Batman and Apple Bruce Wayne!?!   Google Robin Hood and Apple King Richard!? I need to sit down.  This is a lot for me to digest.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Pt12JLe.jpg?1?8895" alt="" /></p>
<p>Not only is the pricing and arguably the promo video apple like, but the company reps are even sounding like apple reps (based on the last three paragraphs of the article).</p>
<p>If google really wants people to take &lsquo;premium&rsquo; chromebooks seriously&hellip;&hellip;it needs to price it not more than thousand and with unlimited online storage (not just three years). Ofcourse it needs to have <span class="caps">LTE</span> too, nobody is gonna buy a 1300 dollar device that only runs on wifi.</p>
<p>I mean nobody is gonna buy even a 1000 dollar device that only runs on wifi</p>
<p>Guys. Guys. I have never in 6 months reading felt the urge to actually sign up. Having said that, This thread literally brought me to tears laughing. Mostly at you guys/ GIFs. But also this product. We will know how bad it is if it ends up on the google search homepage.</p>
<p>Im gonna keep hitting refresh.</p>
<p>This Chromebook Pixel is what happens when Google&rsquo;s engineers twiddle their thumbs, copy the MacBook Pro with 13-inch Retina Display, cripple it by removing features, then say it is original work and sell it at a higher price.</p>
<p>This is aimed at the Apple demographics of people with too much money and not enough sense. Bravo Google bravo. Now these people can walk around with $1,300 chromebooks and look the part.</p>
<p>1000th comment!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a Google&rsquo;s lame attempt to compete with Apple (by imitating it). Why doesn&rsquo;t Google make a <span class="caps">FULL</span> OS and put it on the market. This is a more respectful emplacement for millions of Google&rsquo;s admirers throughout the world. I&rsquo;m not deffending or supporting Apple here, far from that, actually, in my opinion Apple&rsquo;s not been the same since Steve Jobs passed away to the other side of life. It&rsquo;s now really lacking on innovation and creativity. But buying a &ldquo;web-browsing&rdquo; laptop for that priceis such a waste of money. <span class="caps">FAIL</span>!</p>
<p>Because Thom Yorke</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s so full of it. He earns millions of bucks and then complaints that other people also do so.</p>
<p>yep, he&rsquo;s succeeded in labeling radiohead worthless, even though they were a great band before.</p>
<p>I never found Radiohead worthless. They&rsquo;ve always struck me as a modern day Pink Floyd. But I do have to ask:<br />
Is Thom Yorke Playing Willie Nelson in a biopic?<br /><img title="On the road again?" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2013/2/22/1361552836773/Thom-Yorke-009.jpg" alt="On the road again?" /></p>
<p>Thom&rsquo;s side project, Atoms For Peace, came out a few days ago.  It&rsquo;s downloadable from Amazon, iTunes, and Google Play.  So I guess it&rsquo;s not <span class="caps">THAT</span> objectionable, hmmm, Thom?  Anyway, I don&rsquo;t find it useless, and I&rsquo;m enjoying the album (short as it is&hellip;) just as much as I would have if I had to go buy a physical copy.  More so even because of the instant gratification of purchasing it from my phone and not having to rip it on my computer.</p>
<p>Music stores also commoditize CDs and make money selling them&hellip;</p>
<p>Shit music has made music worthless.</p>
<p>Shit music has always been around</p>
<p>The experience has gone out of buying music &amp; its ownership.</p>
<p>Apple assisted that, but if it wasn&rsquo;t them it would be someone else. Not really sure what Google have to do with it, I&rsquo;m surely they barely register as a rounding error in global music sales, although I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Music has just become a weapon in an eco-system war between Apple, Google, Microsoft, Pandora, Spotify &amp; others&hellip; If I was a musician, I&rsquo;d lament that too.</p>
<p>Is there a way to reverse it? Not really, you can keep your music out of many digital catalogue like the Beatles did for so long &amp; Pink Floyd still do, but new artists can&rsquo;t do that. They just have to suck it up.</p>
<p>I still buy physical music, I get what Thom is saying, but I think it&rsquo;s inevitable &ndash; Or at the very least I don&rsquo;t know what the solution is, if there is one.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That is an excellent point, if that&rsquo;s what Thom means, then I agree, it&rsquo;s not really about the music any more, it&rsquo;s about how you can sync it on your phone then wirelessly broadcast it to your car radio. Wowie!</p>
<p>Before Apple, Google, etc., there were record companies and CD distribution channels fighting each other over territory and profits. Either way, the musicians were/are the pawns, so nothing has changed. The only way musicians can stop this is if they get famous and go the Louis CK route of self-distribution. People will say musicians don&rsquo;t have the clout and advertising power. Well, then welcome to working with record companies and tech companies again. You can either sell something locally or work with big companies and sell a lot of product.</p>
<p>I remember back in the 90s, David Bowie took the rights to the residuals from his catalog sales and worked with some financiers who sold bonds backed by those residuals.</p>
<p>Talk about commoditization!</p>
<p>god forbid technology advances to make it easier to listen to music! the horror!</p>
<p>in all honesty im not sure i get the sentiment. people have been selling music since forever. the process of how you pay has changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the big music baddies&rdquo; have been &ldquo;sucking the soul out of music&rdquo; for generations. this is nothing new, just a new face.</p>
<p>I always thought the bands only made real money by touring anyway.</p>
<p>That and payments from organisations like <span class="caps">ASCAP</span> or <span class="caps">BMI</span> if your music gets played on radio/tv/movies, but by that point you&rsquo;re already famous I guess. Someone like The Rolling Stones would be getting some pretty good cheques without touring.</p>
<p>You know the biggest money spinning song ever? Happy Birthday.</p>
<p>Not necessarily.  In the mid-1990s, Pearl Jam tried to flip that around and have cheap concerts subsidized by their record sales.  If memory serves correctly, they were charging $23 for a concert in Australia, while a CD album at the time cost $30.  (And fans would&rsquo;ve spent $90 on their three albums at the time.)</p>
<p>Now, the market insists on $10 albums and free Rdio/Spotify plays, but thinks $99 is reasonable for a non-<span class="caps">VIP</span> concert ticket.</p>
<p>Yes, because being able to just click on a song is so much less about the music than all the trouble people put up with to listen to vinyl.</p>
<p>&gt; Shit music has always been around</p>
<p>But shit music has never been so accessible.</p>
<p>The mid 70s&#8230;</p>
<p>Hey, Rush got their start in the mid 70&rsquo;s! Pink Floyd was at their height!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still hard to believe Rush has fans.</p>
<p>Rush fans unite! Bring down the flame hammer on this hater!</p>
<p>*cricket</p>
<p>Only one cricket?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe that people will say bullshit like this.  There are fans of all types of music that you like and don&rsquo;t like; best you just accept it now.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d feel the same way about some of the shit that you listen to.  Music is a personal thing and there&rsquo;s no point in slagging someone else&rsquo;s choices/enjoyment.</p>
<p>You just proved the point.</p>
<p>No, but you just proved something.</p>
<p>I agree with you.  I have to admit that I&rsquo;m one of the digital download types.  I rarely buy a CD anymore, but I do buy my downloads, I don&rsquo;t steal them.  However I&rsquo;ve recently gotten back into vinyl.  and it was good to see that the music industry as a whole had a sales increase in 2012, and that vinyl itself had a little over a 17% increase.  Just a drop in the overall bucket but still,  I wish that vinyl would make a huge resurgence. Because actual albums was the best format that ever existed.</p>
<p>Yes, an amazing experience of ownership, from buying &ndash; although that&rsquo;s impossible these days around here through to choosing what to listen to &amp; the listening itself.<br />
a physical object, a smell all sorts of indescribable things that add up to someone sticking an iPod on &amp; playing some background music you don&rsquo;t really listen to.</p>
<p>I still have my collection although don&rsquo;t have anything to play them on for now.<br />
I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day I do.</p>
<p>I still sit down and listen with no distractions to new albums with a pair of headphones on while flipping through the pdf that comes through with the album :P</p>
<p>So how is Apple, Google, Spotify, etc. any different than Tower Records, Sam Goody, Camelot Music etc? This was just another musician with too much time on his hands and someone close by to write down his thoughts. Technology has helped music become much more accesible than it has ever been. It&rsquo;s a give and take and the take is that crybabies like Thom who can&rsquo;t adapt or don&rsquo;t understand the current system will be butthurt.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an excellent point.  I mean in the old days of record stores you would browse for bands that you knew and buy what ever striked your fancy.  But you wouldn&rsquo;t pull out an album that looked cool, and buy it if you&rsquo;ve never heard of the band.  I can&rsquo;t even count the hundreds of albums I&rsquo;ve downloaded from iTunes by groups I&rsquo;d never heard of.  I&rsquo;ll check out one album on iTunes, then it&rsquo;ll give you the &ldquo;if you like this, here&rsquo;s something similar&rdquo; section.  I&rsquo;ve bought tons of albums that way after listening to the samples of the songs on iTunes.  Couldn&rsquo;t do that in a record store.  So I think that Thom is only doing himself a dis-service by not getting with the times.  He&rsquo;s only losing money by being stubborn.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t see the problem here.</p>
<p>Musicians have never made too much off of album sales.  Vinyl, CD, digital download, or streaming, the record companies get almost all of the money, not the artists.  As a musician, there is little to no financial difference.  If anything, it might help them, by making their music easier to access, and therefore growing a fanbase.</p>
<p>If anything the record co can&rsquo;t claim as much money for mfg/distribution.  Not that I believe for a second they haven&rsquo;t figured out ways to avoid paying artists more regardless :).</p>
<p>I think part of his complaint is that most people only buy individual songs now, rather than albums.  You&rsquo;re no longer creating an entire musical experience, instead you&rsquo;re positioning for individual #1 singles, which aren&rsquo;t part of a cohesive unit/artistic creation.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s different between the iTunes/Play model vs. CD distribution in the past.  Yeah, they sold singles before, but the ratio of whole albums to single sales was a whole lot higher back then than it is today.</p>
<p>Yorke wants people experiencing an entire album and artist&rsquo;s expression, rather than picking and choosing the catchiest bits.  It&rsquo;s a consumer-unfriendly stance though.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right it&rsquo;s completely consumer unfriendly.  But more than that, Thom&rsquo;s deciding that he doesn&rsquo;t want to sell individual songs.  He wants to sell the full album.  That&rsquo;s fine.  I only buy full albums.  I rarely ever buy an individual song.  But his stance will net him zero dollars.  In the long run even if someone buys certain songs from his albums, it&rsquo;s better than nothing, and will still add to the complete albums that he does sell.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d argue that it&rsquo;s actually consumer <em>friendly</em>. Gone are the days when artists would aim for one or two &ldquo;radio-worthy&rdquo; song and fill the rest of the album with filler. You couldn&rsquo;t just get the good songs; you had to buy the album. In a way, the good songs amortized the cost of the bad ones on an album. If consumers can pick and choose, there is immense pressure to make every song on your album good.</p>
<p>And singles were popular earlier before the whole &ldquo;whole album&rdquo; experience was popular.  It goes in cycles.  Perhaps instead the focus should be on creating albums that are worthy of the whole experience.  When I buy one song it is because the rest kind of suck.</p>
<p>This.  Artists know full well which songs are &ldquo;single&rdquo; quality, and on purpose they space those over multiple albums.  An artist might release 50 songs, but 90% of his sales will be from his top five songs.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with artistic expression, we know it, and Radiohead knows it.</p>
<p>He just does not chose to believe that only a small number of his &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; songs are actually good enough to warrant even $1.</p>
<p>Once in a while I&rsquo;ll cherry pick&mdash; and those are usually songs I get tired of soon enough anyways. If artists want to sell albums, they just have to make enough good songs for it to be worth it. Artists (labels?) can no longer fill up an &ldquo;album&rdquo; with a crap music lifted up by a couple of &ldquo;hits&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what the record companies pursued with cassingles and cd singles.  This is not the fault of the distribution method, its the result of short term profit focus rather than A&amp;R development by the record companies.</p>
<p>I see no reason to buy physical music, or even buy a CD. Why buy anything other than explicitly what you want?</p>
<p>buying physical music today isn&rsquo;t reflective of some past golden age, it&rsquo;s a dinosaur approach of luddism towards technology.</p>
<p>I buy the physical disc usually because I like to have a lossless master. I suspect it&rsquo;s simply a matter of time before lossless is more widely available for download. Crossing my fingers that Apple is working on this since they&rsquo;re doing away with built in optical drives.</p>
<p>Writing made storytellers &ldquo;worthless&rdquo;<br />
Printing made writing &ldquo;worthless&rdquo;<br />
Pictures made paintings &ldquo;worthless&rdquo;<br />
Recording made concerts &ldquo;worthless&rdquo;<br />
Film made plays &ldquo;worthless&rdquo;<br /><span class="caps">VHS</span> made Film &ldquo;worthless&rdquo;<br />
The internet made physical media &ldquo;worthless&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve noticed the pattern, but just to make sure there is no doubt what point I&rsquo;m trying to make:<br />
Technology often makes a medium more accessible and less exclusive, but it often raises the value of the  medium it is expanding. Broadway, Picasso, Game of Thrones, The Avengers, Illuminated manuscripts, are all more expensive than they ever were, and more respected than ever, and there is no need to feel any different with the current expansions of music.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s worthless? That &lsquo;h&rsquo; in Thom. Its F**king <span class="caps">TOM</span>!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a vestigial H.</p>
<p>Is that supposed to make it any less worthless?</p>
<p>Well, Thomas is a name&hellip;. at least Americans don&rsquo;t try to pronounce the TH as in &ldquo;THing&rdquo; like they do with the name Anthony (Antony!!! <span class="caps">ANTONY</span>!!! <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">HEAR</span> ME!!) lol</p>
<p>To anyone calling themselves Thom, I am going to pronounce it THom&hellip;.like thumb.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d probably just pick up that you&rsquo;re annoying and nod away at everything you say.</p>
<p>But the full name is spelled Thomas. Why take the &lsquo;h&rsquo; out when you shorten it?</p>
<p>Most Thom&rsquo;s given names are &ldquo;Thomas&rdquo;.  It makes more sense to shorten the given name than to shorten it and remove a letter.</p>
<p>Just remember not to call Mr Soprano &ldquo;Thony&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t though is it? It&rsquo;s Thom. It&rsquo;s up to him. He owns it.</p>
<p>Funny he should say that, because the only thing Radiohead has done that wasn&rsquo;t worthless was applying the &ldquo;pay what you want&rdquo; model for that album.</p>
<p>Troll rating is 8/10. Should you not be trolling, you&rsquo;re massively ignorant.</p>
<p>Radiohead are extremely overrated in my opinion. A lot of people disagree, still i have the right to think most of their work is worthless.</p>
<p>I think you have the right so say they are overrated. You have the right to say you don&rsquo;t like their music. You have the right to say their music is worthless to you. But the band is incredibly popular, critically acclaimed, and influential. To say they are worthless is trying to argue against those facts.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty clear if someone states &ldquo;XY is worthless&rdquo; he means &ldquo;XY is worthless to me&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You know suicide was popular in Jonestown. Popular doesn&rsquo;t always equal good. One direction and Beiber are popular too. I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re both worthless not only to me but to any living creature on this earth.</p>
<p>By definition, being popular means being not worthless to many people.</p>
<p>So? It&rsquo;s worthless to him.</p>
<p>Sure, and I&rsquo;m not arguing that.</p>
<p>The difference is that music critics across the board do not list &ldquo;My World 2.0&rdquo; in their top albums. Radiohead have 5 albums in Rolling Stone&rsquo;s top 500 albums of all time. That&rsquo;s on par with the likes of David Bowie, Bob Marley, Led Zeppelin and U2. You may not <strong>like</strong> Radiohead, but denying their unequivocal critical acclaim is ignorant. A band does not reach their status by being &ldquo;worthless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because critics are somehow more important than other people?</p>
<p>No it isn&rsquo;t. He has the right to say anything he likes, because we do not live in a police state. To paraphrase, you may disagree with what he says, but you must defend to the death his right to say it.</p>
<p>Yeah, except paraphrasing is supposed to keep the essence of the original statement in tact.</p>
<p>Also you&#8217;re incorrectly paraphrasing a misquote.</p>
<p>What Voltaire actually said was<br />
"Think for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too"</p>
<p>Who said anything about Voltaire? It was written by his biographer to capture the essence of his philosophy, which it does. In any case, the source doesn&rsquo;t matter, it makes a valid point which I have relayed perfectly intact by simply changing the case. Thanks for coming.</p>
<p>I have the right to call him ignorant. See where your stupid argument leads? (I also have the right to call your argument stupid, natch.)</p>
<p>Indeed you are, but you are wrong. He is not trolling nor is he ignorant. Because no one&rsquo;s taste in music is &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo;. That is absurd. You are confusing opinions with facts.</p>
<p>Likewise, my argument is not stupid, it is a clear logical argument.</p>
<p>Argument is allowed, but it has winners and losers. This is you losing.</p>
<p>Your troll rating is higher. If the guy does not like Radiohead&rsquo;s music, that is not trolling or ignorant. That is his opinion and his right. You thinking it is, is both trolling and ignorant.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo;, he made a statement that everything Radiohead has done besides a pay what you want album is worthless. I would say that music critics have unequivocally stated that the work Radiohead has put out has been some of the most influential for its time. Making a statement like, &ldquo;The Beatles made no contributions to Pop&rdquo; could be an opinion, or it could be made as a statement, but it can be proven that that&rsquo;s not true, just the same as it can be proven that Radiohead have made significant, meaningful contributions to music in their time and that is a consensus.</p>
<p>Ignoring facts is ignorant.</p>
<p>Music&rsquo;s &ldquo;worth&rdquo; is entirely subjective, therefore it is de facto his opinion.</p>
<p>Critics hated the Rite of Spring. Rolling Stone trashed Led Zeppelin through their whole career. So what? It&rsquo;s just an opinion. Music is music. There are no rules how you anyone should feel about it. Criticism is not definitive, it can be useful to whet the appetite, to suggest things, but in the final analysis it&rsquo;s all just an opinion.</p>
<p>What do you mean by &ldquo;The Beatles made no contributions to Pop&rdquo; precisely? Do you mean quantity of songs? Influence? What if I hold to be worthless the musicians they influenced? Quality? That is purely subjective.</p>
<p>Failing to understand the difference between facts and opinions is ignorant.</p>
<p><em>Failing to understand the difference between facts and opinions is ignorant.</em></p>
<p>So, genius, is that a fact or an opinion?</p>
<p>I see what he&rsquo;s coming at, but it has more to do with the people than others.  In Japan, the average spent on music is about $20 (I think) while in the US it&rsquo;s ($1).</p>
<p>In reality, music&rsquo;s worth rate is a log function.  As it becomes older, the less people are interested in it, excluding in rare cases, and in that case the worth is more in the consumer than on the artist.</p>
<p>Of course the less people are interested. God forbid they continue to do their job and make more music.</p>
<p>No sympathy for artists.</p>
<p>Never build your foundation on sand. It&rsquo;s your own fault when things start to wash away.   <br />
  <br />
I have no sympathy for the person who doesn&rsquo;t give themselves a way out. An &ldquo;Ace in the hole&rdquo; so to speak. In this day and age, you have no excuse to not be educated enough to have something to fall back on.</p>
<p>jesus</p>
<p>I would argue that for most people music has become essentially a fungible commodity. With &ldquo;free&rdquo; streaming of all but the most obscure bands out there, Internet radio, and hell, even commercial radio, there is more art out tere than people can consume in a lifetime. I rarely seek out specific songs anymore, but rather curated playlists, established DJs, and whatever iTunes slaps together on my genius playlist (of like 25,000 tracks). Easy and unfettered access to art necessarily devalues it.</p>
<p>We all know what happens when supply outstrips demand&hellip;</p>
<p>Not true. So not true. It isn&#8217;t that people become less interested, as you will see by the sales figures of bands that appeal to ages 30-50</p>
<p>It&#8217;s that new music is heavily marketed to teenagers, and teenagers alone and is marketed on sexuality not ability.</p>
<p>In defence of marketing to teenagers. Music marketing has realized that you bond to the music you listen to as a teenager is stronger than at any other point in you natural life. If you go through your parents&rsquo; and grandparents&rsquo; music library the majority of if it will probably be artists their age or slightly older.</p>
<p>For example, the artist Prince will sell out concert halls. His audience is primarily people in their late 30s to early 50s because they were teenagers when he became popular. My favourite artists are Jay-Z, Kanye, Biggie, Tupac, Mobb Deep, and the Wu. According to my teenage niece they are old school. But guess who has money to buy $90 concert tickets, cover charge at release parties, and LPs? She has a few bands she likes that I don&rsquo;t really care for but to her they are the entire world. If they are still around in 6-10 years she&rsquo;ll have her own money for concerts and release parties.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s worthless to the company, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s worthless to the listener.</p>
<p>Huge Radiohead fan.  I&rsquo;m going to disagree with Thom on this.  Piracy made music a commodity.  Apple and Google had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Piracy has a negative effect on music, but how does <span class="caps">NOT</span> paying for something make it a commodity? Companies creating fake images around &ldquo;artists&rdquo; only interested in money have turned music into a commodity.</p>
<p>It took away just about every barrier to entry.  You don&rsquo;t have to leave your house or pay for it.</p>
<p>But a commodity is something you pay for.</p>
<p>You look like an idiot  whose old girlfriend was a Radiohead fan and then dump you and fucked your best friend, by replying everyone in this post.</p>
<p>Other than that, &ldquo;Kid A | Amnesiac | I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings&rdquo; as a period of Radiohead are some of the greatest musical performances ever recorded.</p>

<p>lol. Just a topic i&rsquo;m very passionate about.</p>

<p>I love &ldquo;In Rainbows&rdquo;, but i don&rsquo;t like a single song from any of the other albums (yes, i have listened to all of them).</p>
<p>Wow. Fanboi much?</p>
<p>No i don&rsquo;t like Radiohead&rsquo;s new works. Those albums were released 12-13 years ago. I just have respect for those.</p>
<p>Again, fanboi much?</p>
<p>Nonsense. Piracy does not have a negative effect on music. It has a negative effect on music sales and record labels, but so has digitisation and the move to the 99p single track sale instead of £5.00 for three tracks.</p>
<p>If you look at how the price of gigs has outstripped inflation, there are a lot of artists out there once established that are raking it in. The problem is when you get artists that aren&#8217;t themselves willing to reinvest in new music.</p>
<p>Apple and Google are merely middle men. Anyone can be a musician now. Anyone can make mobile games now. Any one can start a blog now. Increase in supply drives the costs down. It&rsquo;s not rocket surgery.</p>
<p>I would pay to see some rocket surgery, that sounds amusingly bloody</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s just pissed because he has to tour to make money since he can&rsquo;t just rake in the cash because people are slowly realizing most music is crap and not worth buying, hell most isn&rsquo;t even worth streaming</p>
<p>Weird, I just paid $9 through one of these services for the new Atoms For Peace record&hellip; I&rsquo;m guessing the checks still clear for you even though it is &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; right?</p>
<p>Content is an umbrella term, how is this any sillier than the music industry <span class="caps">ITSELF</span> just calling it <span class="caps">PRODUCT</span>.</p>
<p>Sorry Thom but Apple and Google hasn&rsquo;t made music worthless. Napster made music worthless, it was cheaper and easier than going to the store to buy an overpriced plastic disc. Without digital stores by giants like those, more people would still be pirating.</p>
<p>People still are, but at a lower rate(?)</p>
<p>This is another stupid artist that is clueless about the business he&rsquo;s actually in presenting an argument that is entirely devoid of logic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Google and Apple make tons of money off music, and in doing so, pay the music industry (and therefore artists like me) <span class="caps">BILLIONS</span> OF <span class="caps">DOLLARS</span> A <span class="caps">YEAR</span> &ndash; a number that is actually <strong>increasing</strong> every year for the first time in over a decade!  They are <strong>clearly</strong> shitheads because of this, for reasons I cannot articulate, but have something to do with how much money they are making me!  Don&rsquo;t buy my music!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really great argument, Thom.</p>
<p>Yeah, lead singer for one of the biggest rock bands in the world over the last 2 decades knows nothing about the music industry. Meanwhile, Verge commentor and lead roadie for a shitty dive bar cover band educates us on how it really is.</p>
<p>Sometimes people inside the business can&rsquo;t see the whole picture as well as outsiders can. People (should) never judge their own work, they rely on others with a broader, neutral view. Same principle.</p>
<p>considering i just bought the new Atoms for Peace album in itunes, i think he&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>To be fair, he has a point. Though probably not in the way he intended. Take for example the fact that most of these online services replace dirty songs with clean ones. What is the agenda there? It&rsquo;s not to connect musicians with their audience, it&rsquo;s simply to lock users into a service and the service isn&rsquo;t as the artist intended, it&rsquo;s instead about servicing music to the widest audience in the &ldquo;safest&rdquo; of manner at a minimum cost.</p>
<p>Who cares what their motive for lock-in is? (I do, super annoying, but another subject)&hellip; these companies are putting money into artist (well, label) pockets that otherwise would not be there.</p>
<p>But if there&rsquo;s not even the integrity of giving users what the artists deliver to the labels, how can you expect artists to get behind that?</p>
<p>Dang &ndash; Thom&rsquo;s shooting lasers all over Google and Apple</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/be17d41a2d93e4c85e5bf7772dcc0017/tumblr_mixr1zaNGW1rdywzbo3_250.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Insert some lasers in that gif you got yourself a recommend.</p>
<p>I think the quote is taken a little out of context. I think he is referring to how music is no longer tangible and is just a thing that lives on your device with all your other little digital things that are free or cost $0.99. Its not a record or a CD you open up and listen to in your living room for the experience. It&rsquo;s a point you see a lot of &lsquo;older&rsquo; artists making these days. Jack White in particular.</p>
<p>Look guys, look, someone read the actual article, and applied thought! Get your pitchforks and torches!</p>
<p>Thom&rsquo;s strong suit is not in being a coherent conversationalist, but I think that you are right that this was the point Thom was trying to make.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s listening habits have changed because of streaming services and individual song purchases so that now the concept of the album is marginalized.</p>
<p>Indeed. Artists could just release singles these days, and no one would notice.</p>
<p>Why should I care about CDs, Albuns, Art or any other shit like that if I&rsquo;m interested in the <span class="caps">MUSIC</span> <span class="caps">ITSELF</span>?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to care about CDs, albums, or art. For several people, however, the album helps you enjoy the music. Some albums have a real nice flow to them and feel better than a playlist on a media player.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think this will be undermined in some way&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only way to &ldquo;undermine&rdquo; Apple/Google/et al would be someone that could sell the music for <span class="caps">LESS</span> overall. I&rsquo;m not sure there is a disruptive business model that leads to higher prices overall. Look at the current &ldquo;disruptive&rdquo; media companies Spotify and Rdio. By all measures artists get even less money from those services.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t get these artists. It is like they feel entitled to earn millions of dollars to play music. I mean, lets be real, they don&rsquo;t provide some incredible public service, they have talent yes, but so do professional (I don&rsquo;t know) hacky sackers and they don&rsquo;t make millions. Also, there are a ton of bands that never made it big that are equally good.</p>
<p>The problem is that these artists feel they got where they are because they are the best when in reality it is because they happened to become popular.</p>
<p>Another argument is the flashback theory, which I completely agree. Before records, eight tracks,tapes, minidisks, CD&rsquo;s, MP3&rsquo;s, and streaming services artists made their money from performing shows. Then distribution came along which, lets face it, was a cash grab in itself. But now we are supposed to feel sorry for them?</p>
<p>Hey Thom, you want more money, go play some Fu@king shows.</p>
<p>I say we boycott all the greedy mainstream artists along with the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> and support the Indy ones who are happy making any money at all.</p>
<p>good thing you did not release your new album on iTunes to stop that horrible commodifynig process in its tracks, Thom.<br />
oh wait. you did.</p>
<p>He just want the old days back. You know when a 10 track cd was $15-20 with a hit single and 9 crap songs effectively making a single song worth up to 20 times more than now when we can pick good songs from the bunch of crappy ones. Sorry for him but Apple, Google &amp; Amazon had make thing fair for consumer.</p>
<p>Really? if the&rsquo;re ever a band that does <span class="caps">NOT</span> fall under the 1 Hit + 9 filler umbrella it&rsquo;s Radiohead.</p>
<p>That is in no way his complaint. Radiohead have made far more money from their records recently than in the old days.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s &ldquo;cool&rdquo; to bash the big guns.</p>
<p>He is just trying to stay cool.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for Apple and Google monetizing music online then the industry would have collapsed years ago, and P2P and file sharing would have been the only way people get their music. Did he just forget about Napster &ndash; Morpheous?</p>
<p>Yeah, if this guy&rsquo;s so smart, why didn&rsquo;t he come up with some way to just sell music directly on his website or something. He&rsquo;s just mad that there&rsquo;s absolutely no way to sell music except for Apple and Google.</p>
<p>Seriously, I don&rsquo;t think this has so much to do with money, but how people relate to music now.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not smart at all. He is however a very talented musician.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.waste.uk.com">Umm&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he know what the term commodity means.</p>
<p>Music and newspapers were made &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; by the march of technology, not Apple or Google.</p>
<p>Thom comes off sounding pretty ignorant of the realities of the world here.</p>
<p>He has a point. Apple, Spotify and other Deezers pay artists less than the record companies did/do.</p>
<p>They just made use of modern technology. If Apple and Spotify would not have done that, there would have been others.</p>
<p>Sure thing. The old model &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a record, sell thousands/millions of them and sit on our lazy asses for 3 years&rdquo; is over. There have never been as much concerts as nowerdays. Sadly enough, the ticket prices doubled/tripled.</p>
<p>and before Napster, Morpheus, DirectConnect, etc&hellip; there was the CD writer!</p>
<p>So they made billions by making music worthless? What?</p>
<p>The ones that turned music into a commodity are labels creating fake images around &ldquo;artists&rdquo; who are only interested in the fame and the money, not in the actual music.</p>
<p>What made music &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; is the internet. If Apple and Google didn&rsquo;t exist, someone else would have done what they did. And if no one else existed, even more people would pirate music, making it even more worthless.</p>
<p>What does that even mean &ldquo;in order to commodify it, they had to make it worthless&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s an oxymoron. A commodity is something you pay for, thus not worthless.</p>
<p>Maybe there&rsquo;s some other type of &ldquo;worth&rdquo; than money. You pay money to get a commodity, and that&rsquo;s all you do with music now. It&rsquo;s just like buying shoes or apples. Music now has no &ldquo;worth&rdquo; outside the commercial transaction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying I agree with this, but I don&rsquo;t think he is misunderstanding what a commodity is.</p>
<p>While i agree with you, it seems to me like he means &ldquo;money&rdquo; when talking about music being worthless. Of course i might misunderstand him.</p>
<p>You did not misunderstood him. I work for the music industry &amp; individual artists. There is no such artist that makes music for fun. They want to make money so they can live their life as an artist. It&rsquo;s their work. They &ldquo;work&rdquo; differently, but they work. But we all work for money, don&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>There are a lot of poor artists who work for very little money and a lot of artists who have another job and don&rsquo;t earn any money with their art at all. Those people make music (or other forms of art) for fun, although &ldquo;passion&rdquo; might be a better word.</p>
<p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s clear those people do it for fun, because they don&rsquo;t earn anything. But does that mean everyone earning lots of money doesn&rsquo;t do it for fun? Who am i to judge?</p>
<p>Every successfull artist started one day &ldquo;for fun&rdquo;, for &ldquo;the passion&rdquo;. When things get serious and success (and money) come along, it&rsquo;s a human behaviour to try keeping things that way. I know quite some successfull belgian artists personally and they boldly admit that 2 shows out of 10 are really fun, the rest&hellip;<br />
There is nothing wrong with that. I started coding for fun. And I&rsquo;m not always having fun when coding to make a living. Every job is like that, or maybe I&rsquo;m wrong&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree. Still, it raises the question whether music created as a job has the same artistic value as music created with passion. You can write good code even if you are not in the mood, because it&rsquo;s mathematics. But art is emotion. You can&rsquo;t force emotion.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that Thom York makes music just for fun. Of course he wants to get paid. I just don&rsquo;t think that was his point here. I thought most artists made most of their money through concerts anyway.</p>
<p>I could be wrong though; maybe he just wants more money.</p>
<p>It was the record labels that &ldquo;commonditized&rdquo; music <span class="caps">LONG</span> before piracy or online distribution or <span class="caps">ANY</span> of it. Most artists never got any money from record sales anyway, they get it from the labels as an advance that they have to pay back which comes from they money they make touring and on album sales (which, let&rsquo;s remember, isn&rsquo;t much).</p>
<p>I really fail to see what point he is trying to make or what evidence he has to back it up.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I agree. Isn&rsquo;t the music industry making more money now that it has in many years? If it wasn&rsquo;t for music stores like iTunes, Amazon and Google Music making it easy to pay for music, piracy would be much worse. I think music subscription services should be more of a concern to artists.</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t music always a commodity?  It is a produced item that can be sold.  If anything, the digital age made music less of a commodity, and Apple/Google/Amazon reintroduced some sense of worth and value to the product.</p>
<p>I love Radiohead, but I don&rsquo;t think Apple is doing anyone a disservice with regard to music.  The democratization of access to the iTunes platform has, if anything, made the world of music a million times better.  I spent some time in the music industry, and I remember the importance of trying to get your album on the shelf at the local record store.  Without distribution, this was next to impossible unless you knew the owner.  Now the &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; can be accessed by every single artist that wants to be there.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s more rooted in access to music.</p>
<p>In days before we had digital distribution there wasn&rsquo;t as many avenues to finding new music as a consumer. You basically had what was given to you (radio), what you found on your own (record store) and what was recommended to you by people that, in theory, share interests with you (friends).</p>
<p>Now we have iTunes, the Play store, Amazon, Spotify, Last, Rdio, Mog&hellip; I could go on, but honestly creating an exhaustive list would take too long. Almost all of these services offer all three of the previously used discovery techniques.</p>
<p>What Apple, Google, Amazon, etc have created isn&rsquo;t a commodity (music has always been something that people want and are willing to pay for). They&rsquo;ve created competition in its simplest form. Consumers of music have access to ridiculously more than they ever have before. Therefor the consumer gets more picky.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Thom this means there are lots of people out there creating better music than him that have easy ways to get distributed (and discovered), so he gets the cold shoulder.</p>
<p>Says the guy that sold the MP3 album of &ldquo;In Rainbows&rdquo; for whatever price people wanted to pay.</p>
<p>Anyways, it isn&rsquo;t the distributors that have made music worthless, it&rsquo;s the technological advancements and price cuts that have lowered the bar for anyone to record a track in their bedroom with their laptop, upload it to Soundcloud and sell tracks on Bandcamp.</p>
<p>Music is cheaper now because it&rsquo;s cheaper to make and distribute: Welcome to technology.</p>
<p>Value is more than monetary. I think what he meant by music being &lsquo;worthless&rsquo; is that it&rsquo;s not making a connection with people anymore, its just being used to fill the space in the services and devices being marketed to us.</p>
<p>I kinda&rsquo; see what he&rsquo;s saying, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to do with him not making enough money. I probably spend more money now on music than I did in the past, but I find I don&rsquo;t actually listen to what I buy as much. Amazon will do some sale and I&rsquo;ll end up with like 5 albums that just end up on shuffle. Six months later I&rsquo;ll realize that I still don&rsquo;t know the lyrics to a lot of those songs (which have been diluted by continued music sales) and have no strong feelings about them.</p>
<p>As a kid\young adult getting an album was a big deal. I&rsquo;d listen to it over and over again and really think about what every song was saying.</p>
<p>Still, I don&rsquo;t know if this is a bad thing. I have a hard time believing that it is bad to be able to have easy access to all kinds of music for cheap.</p>
<p>I totally agree. I&rsquo;m really torn. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s great to be able to access almost every song you can think of, on the other hand you don&rsquo;t really listen anymore. That&rsquo;s why on the one hand i pay for Spotify premium, on the other hand i started to listen to vinyl again.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Before the advent of digital stores, an album was expensive. It was something you&rsquo;d save up for, so when you finally acquired it, it became something cherished. You also couldn&rsquo;t go on a shopping spree in a record shop unless there was a discount, so you had more time to listen to each purchase.</p>
<p>I think the ease of actually listening to the music has also got something to do with it. In the past you&rsquo;d go to the record shop, buy the album you want, walk back, tear off the plastic wrapper, opened the case, take out the CD/vinyl and pop it into the player (I know they are little things, but they all add up to the experience). Now it&rsquo;s a few clicks to buy an song or album and another couple of clicks to play it. You don&rsquo;t even flip through the digital booklet the album comes with anymore because it&rsquo;s such a faff in comparison. I don&rsquo;t want to knock on the digital audio file as a medium because I&rsquo;m not a Luddite (and because I&rsquo;m too young to be able to appreciate physical media), but I do agree that we spend less attention on our music because of it.</p>
<p>People keep saying that, but on the other hand&hellip; i still have vinyl records, and i don&rsquo;t spend any more attention listening to them than i spend listening to Spotify. Yes, you have to buy them, put them on, etc. But as soon as they are spinning, they disappear in the background. I&rsquo;m starting to think it&rsquo;s not the way we listen to music that&rsquo;s degrading the experience, it&rsquo;s all the other stuff we do while listening to music, it&rsquo;s the flood of content / information that&rsquo;s shoved in our faces all day long.</p>
<p>that title is pure trolling, poor effort Verge. this isnt news as it should be</p>
<p>fanboy alert!</p>
<p>^idiot alert</p>
<p>thom yorke never mentions either company in the article, though the reporter, tim adams, does</p>
<p>Thom Yorke should not speak about things he clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>and you, you do&hellip;</p>
<p>read the article, the verge&rsquo;s writeup is misleading</p>
<p>Its really the artists own fault, I have <span class="caps">ZERO</span>, and I by that I mean negative sympathy for them. They decided <span class="caps">YEARS</span> ago to crawl into bed with the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> and the <span class="caps">MPAA</span>.</p>
<p>Music was never worth $20 for a cd of 6 songs. Never. Just because it was an exclusive club to join due to artificial limits on distribution in the past does not mean they can ride that gravvy train into the 21st century.</p>
<p>As with any other commodity the freer the access to it, the lower the barrier to entry the more is availble the less it will cost.</p>
<p>They are just mad their gravvy train has come to an end and others can vie for the exclusive club. Like most (if not all) in the top socio-economic status, they want to keep the status quo, and will not hesitate to trample you to do it.</p>
<p>If these idiots had their way we&rsquo;d be renting the air we breath from them.</p>
<p>15 years ago, in Belgium, CD+booklet manufacturing costs were 1$ (one). Still, record companies (in this case Sony Music Belgium) kept on selling CD&rsquo;s for 20$. The artists were paid less than 1$/CD<br />
Where&rsquo;s the money?</p>
<p>Music was a commodity long before Apple and Google even existed.</p>
<p>Musicians and their record companies (whom they don&rsquo;t really need) get between 70 and 90 cents for every song that is sold on the internet.  I doubt they were getting anywhere near that per song when they were sold in CDs or LPs, after the retailers, distributors, and mfrs got their cut.  So yeah, they have to sell them individually, instead of forcing people to buy a whole album, which was almost always loaded with unwanted songs.  Tough life.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s what i thought when AC/DC complained they couldn&rsquo;t sell songs only bundled as an album on iTunes (which they actually <strong>could</strong> have done, but whatever): &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t release albums full of filling material then&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Every person with a job tends to think of their job as immutable &mdash; or at least that it <em>should</em> be immutable. I wonder how many people who lost their horse-related jobs to car mechanics when automobiles were introduced thought that the shift was an absolutely bad move for society to take.</p>
<p>Everyone wants the way they&rsquo;ve chosen to make money to stay exactly the same, so they continue to make money they way they&rsquo;re used to, but society moves on. It may seem unfair to you, and laws and barriers can be put up to make society still invest in your way of making a buck, but resentment will grow.</p>
<p>People want music the way they want music. Apple/Google/etc. didn&rsquo;t change how people <em>wanted</em> music, they gave the people a means of acquiring it in the way they already wanted it. Are they capitalizing off of that shift in public habits? Sure they are. But it doesn&rsquo;t devalue music any more than music was already devalued in peoples&rsquo; minds (if that&rsquo;s what really happened).</p>
<p>For the record, Thom Yorke nor the rest of Radiohead came up with the idea to do the pay what you want experiment. <span class="caps">IIRC</span> it was their manager that convinced them to do it, and shortly there after the band stated they would probably never do it again. So this isn&rsquo;t really new&hellip;</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s pissed the result of the pay-what-you-want experiment was that people don&rsquo;t think Radiohead is worth anything? ^^</p>
<p>Music had already been &lsquo;commodified&rsquo; by record labels and the likes of <span class="caps">HMV</span>. What difference does it make to consumers whether it&rsquo;s Google or <span class="caps">HMV</span> cashing in on a musician&rsquo;s work?</p>
<p>Is it really the tech companies?  Free music has been around a while now and really hasn&rsquo;t that devalued it?  Napster, torrent?  Why pay for something I can get free (moral issues aside).  What Apple did is make it more reasonable and more accessible.  Why make someone buy an entire album for one song.  This is exactly what consumers want (same for TV <span class="caps">BTW</span> &ndash; only charge me for shows or channels I want).  Consumers are what musicians need to make money.  I don&rsquo;t think that good musicians are in any way struggling, it has forced them to tour more vs make an album and just sit around raking in cash.</p>
<p>How did those poor musicians ever make money before the invention of music archiving? OH that&rsquo;s right! They <span class="caps">PERFORMED</span> their music live and got paid. Shrewd businessmen realized they could make money off of somebody else&rsquo;s hard work and the entertainment &ldquo;industry&rdquo; was born. Artists throughout history have struggled to make enough money to survive. They did it for the craft. It&rsquo;s only been since the middle of the twentieth century that it became a good occupational decision monetarily. Take a look at Gene Simmons. He envisioned the <span class="caps">KISS</span> marketing engine before they made their first record. It&rsquo;s not an easy subject to categorize and there is no easy solution.</p>
<p>Music has <span class="caps">NEVER</span> been valuable. In fact art has no intrinsic value. What is valuable is the distribution aspect of consuming art. If their is only 1 painting in a gallery and people like seeing it they will pay for to do that. If you could 100% copy that painting and teleport it to any where in the world, people wont pay as much as they did to see it. It&rsquo;s value drops because the supply is plentiful.</p>
<p>The was not a modern music business until companies figured out how to record and distribute it. First sheet paper, then vinyl, then magnetic tape. All moved by truck, sea and air. Thats what we have all been paying for for the last 70 yrs. Not the actual music.</p>
<p>Now we have digital distribution we can instantly get 100% clones of art for pennies, delivered straight to our phones and computers. There are not trucks, ships, planes or factories involved. So what &ldquo;cost&rdquo; is the consumer expected to pay?</p>
<p>Tom Yorke has figured out that it wasnt the music that made him millions, it was the scarcity and difficulty of delivering the product that made him rich.The economics of supply and demand define the price of everything, from bankers bonuses, to nurses pay. Music is no different.</p>
<p>no, its just that <span class="caps">YOU</span> dont find any value in music. you know the price, but value is a whole different thing, and clearly you do not understand the difference.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Thats hilarious. The &ldquo;value&rdquo; of art is anything you wish it to be. That&rsquo;s up to the individual. The &ldquo;price&rdquo; however is derived by supply and demand. Mr Yorke is complaining that the lowering of the &ldquo;price&rdquo; determines the value to the consumer. You and Mr Yorke seem not to be able to separate the two things, not me.</p>
<p>The industry that Mr Yorke has benefited from seems to think that price and the value of art are linked. They are not. That&rsquo;s what the problem is.</p>
<p>There are many countries in the world that do not have huge music industries that make musicians millions. Yet the people still make music, people enjoy it and everyone gets on with their lives.</p>
<p>Nope, Thom says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We were so into the net around the time of Kid A,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Really thought it might be an amazing way of connecting and communicating. And then very quickly we started having meetings where people started talking about what we did as &lsquo;content&rsquo;. They would show us letters from big media companies offering us millions in some mobile phone deal or whatever it was, and they would say all they need is some content. I was like, what is this &lsquo;content&rsquo; which you describe? Just a filling of time and space with stuff, emotion, so you can sell it?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The value he speaks of is not monetary, and his argument is much more open-ended than the verge suggests.</p>
<p>Oh music was commoditised a <span class="caps">LONG</span> time before it became easy to download it.</p>
<p>Christ, Radiohead used to be on <span class="caps">EMI</span>. They managed to commoditise it in the 60s!</p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t that why they left and started releasing their music independently?</p>
<p>Apparently $9.99 is worthless, because that&rsquo;s how much <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/amok/id587383295?ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Thom&rsquo;s new album</a> costs on iTunes, along with the rest of the albums in the Radiohead catalog.</p>
<p>What he is talking about is the commoditisation of music as a product instead of music being an art.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking nonsense. But that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s trying to say.</p>
<p>The irony of this being that music was always commoditised as a product instead of art. He obviously wants to block out anything pre-Dylan&#8230;</p>
<p>I became much more of a music nerd when I started buying digitally. Sorry Thom, I don&rsquo;t have the space for 1,000+ CDs.</p>
<p>I agree with him. Look at things like Spotify or Rdio. We don&rsquo;t value albums as before when using these services. When I buy a physical album, I listen the hell out of it, from the first to the last track, while looking at the booklet or album cover. And the anticipation when you have to wait to that new record to arrive helps to value it more, or all the trouble of going to some record store to find some hard to find CD. But the instant gratification of downloading something from iTunes or streaming it from Spotify&hellip; it&rsquo;s not same. You listen to it, then switch to another one, the discover another one, etc. It makes music less valuable, even disposable. I think Paul Miller wrote about this same topic.</p>
<p>Of course, digital has a lot of advantages. But I can&rsquo;t disagree with Thom in this point.</p>
<p>I disagree completely. The music I really enjoy, I still listen to over and over, it&rsquo;s just easier to access now. But I also get access to all the other mediocore music that I&rsquo;m not that interested in. That shit I listen to once or twice and move on&hellip; but the stuff I really like, the bands I really care about, I mark their release dates in my calendars and stream them over and over and over.</p>
<p>Nothing has really changed as far as listening habits and following favorite bands/arists except the medium.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always been that &lsquo;music from the soul&rsquo; type is hard to make money off of. If your&rsquo;e not purposely making music to appeal to the masses, it&rsquo;s nearly impossible to make a lot of money off of it. Is that what he&rsquo;s trying to change? GL.</p>
<p>Come on, <span class="caps">AAPL</span> and <span class="caps">GOOG</span> merely responded to the new era&rsquo;s entertainment needs. Physical media gets more outdated as time passes. Fast food &ndash; fast entertainment.</p>
<p>I should have better read it first :/ was too hasty with my comment.</p>
<p>I really dislike the idea that artists believe their is value to music, as in actual money. I&rsquo;ve done a few odd electro songs and always released them for free on SoundCloud, because making someone pay for an enjoyment or a hobby feels weird.</p>
<p>If I were to go full time on making music, I&rsquo;d still try to make it free and put it on streaming services; all you really need is fans, touring makes enough money.</p>
<p>Yes, music is available all around the world on the same day. At any time you feel like it. So?</p>
<p>The superstar era of music was short-lived. The &lsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s were a particular era. We have pop radio, the Hit Parade, and Rock. The long playing record became an art form, while the worldwide publicity system had just gotten up and running. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re making mass market teens anymore. It&rsquo;s not cool. And instead of promoters and radio play ruling everything, we have peers, streaming, music on the network. Apple didn&rsquo;t invent that, it just pointed the way things are going. I think we should have a lot of well-paying jobs for accomplished musicians. Teenagers like to have parties. Songs are forever. Figure something out instead of blaming your misery on anything external.</p>
<p>Britisher Please.  Napster, etc, did that.   Kids these days just use music as fashion and background music.</p>
<p>Apple and Google are competing with free.  Their services are a convenience.</p>
<p>Apple at least has iTunes LPs and Mastered For iTunes crap.  It&rsquo;s nothing like a vinyl listening session.</p>
<p>Breaking news! Musicians screwed then, are still getting screwed now! Full story at 11&hellip;</p>
<p>At the time of typing, Radiohead&rsquo;s album &ldquo;OK Computer&rdquo; is #12 on the Google Play charts.</p>
<p>Argument invalid. Next?</p>
<p>The namechecking of &ldquo;Apple and Google and all of the rest&rdquo;  comes from the pen of the writer , not Yorke. If Yorke had singled out Google and Apple it would have been in quotes.</p>
<p>Here is the actual quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want? I still think it will be undermined in some way. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me. Anyway, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace. The commodification of human relationships through social networks. Amazing!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Verge headlines this as a story when it&rsquo;s just a musician expressing genuine concern about something that means something to him.</p>
<p>In any case&hellip; I&rsquo;m enjoying the new Atoms for Peace album. I downloaded the leak, bought it on Google Play and purchased the physical copy.</p>
<p>Keep doing what you do Thom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m reversing.<br />
I&rsquo;m reverse running.<br />
I fall under the horses feet.<br />
All the things that I shouldn&rsquo;t see.<br />
Animal or Bird.<br />
Animal or Bird.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>I am pro-iTunes. I honestly believe it&rsquo;s paved the way for some great advances in the music industry&hellip;</p>
<p>- It opened the door for a ton of competitors. Not just fellow big names like Amazon MP3 and Google Play, but also smaller folks like eMusic and 7 Digital. Especially when Steve Jobs and his VPs got the labels to agree to killing <span class="caps">DRM</span>.<br />
- It made it extremely easy for artists to self-publish their music on a global scale. Before, you needed a label for that kind of reach. The only thing that would aid that is better store curation and discovery tools.<br />
- It helped to reduce the wave of piracy amongst normal, non-power users. It was far easier and less risky getting an album from iTunes than BitTorrent.</p>
<p>My love affair with music has only been aided by digital. It is getting easier and easier for me to maintain a great collection and listen to music at my convenience, meaning I listen to far more.</p>
<p>Where I can, I buy direct from indie labels, direct from bands via services like Bandcamp, or even help fund the albums by smaller acts I love on PledgeMusic and Kickstarter. And sure, in some ways cheaper digital purchases can reduce the emotional connection to a piece of music &ndash; impulse purchases are far easier now &ndash; but even that is beneficial to the art form. There is so much less financial risk for someone to explore new music nowadays.</p>
<p>Whatever he&#8217;s smoking, I want some!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s making him feel proud that they are acquiring one company a week. How is that always a good thing? Google just looks desperate for the NEXT BIG THING™ to not have to depend on advertising only.</p>
<p>how does that work with their new policy to concentrate on a few important products instead of trying out a lot of different stuff? are they only buying companies that are related to their focus? i kinda doubt that..</p>
<p>And hence why the startup community love Google. Every one dreams one day google will buy your startup and that is a good thing cause everything grows(silicon vally). Not some companies that charge a premium for the same Chinese made stuff, make a killing profit to sit on(and share holders)</p>
<p>Every company is free to charge a premium for Chinese made stuff. Ever thought that people pay the premium because it&#8217;s actually worth it? Buy a recent Apple product, use it for a few months and you will get the answer yourself.</p>
<p>Exactly. If Apple puts in the money for R+D and regulating strict manufacturing practices, then they get to charge a premium for the resulting (made in China) product, which is:<br />
a) extremely high quality<br />
b) holds its value over time (very very well)<br />
c) backed by Apple (not &#8216;carrier&#8217;) service support, which some of that &#8216;premium&#8217; you pay goes toward.</p>
<p>That is how you guys made fun when he said a while ago that Android will dominate, and here we are today. You don&#8217;t even know the arrangements they have going on but yet &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, so:</p>
<p>- Android becoming the primary platform for apps<br />
- Google TV taking over<br />
- around 24 new subsidiaries</p>
<p>&#8230; by 7th June 2012? Do you believe this?</p>
<p>And, in 6 months most devs will prioritize Android instead of iOS.</p>
<p>Well… not a chance.</p>
<p>Why is this so hard to believe? It&#8217;s definitely not certain but how can everyone be so against it? Isn&#8217;t the Android market share at around 45% right now? And consistently growing? If in 6 months it&#8217;s 50% why wouldn&#8217;t a developer target an OS with a customer base <em>millions</em> more than the next popular?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t spew that fragmentation crap either. Apps, not games, are not that difficult to make work for any of the modern versions of Android. What was that big developer who put out the graphic about Android fragmentation that people ran with, only for them to come out and say &#8220;wait we didn&#8217;t mean it was bad, we only had two developers code our Android app&#8221;? I want to say it was Twitter but that could be wrong.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Rovio say they made more money off of Ad-based Angry Birds on Android than on iOS? Or at least, something like that. Didn&#8217;t the company behind Pocket Legends say their Android version was more profitable than iOS?</p>
<p>Look. Whether it happens or not is another story, but you&#8217;re kidding yourself if you blindly assume Android would never overtake iOS in app development.</p>
<p>Besides, he said he could see it happening. He didn&#8217;t come out completely bullish on the subject.</p>
<p>Found what I was looking for:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/17941/android_ios_app_profit" target="_blank">http://blogs.computerworld.com/17941/android_ios_app_profit</a></p>
<p>its like saying 50% phones will have android ..who believes these kinda crap</p>
<p>sarcasm right?</p>
<p>I know right? sheesh</p>
<p>When you can spend this much time talking about the products that bring in about 3% of your revenue you can afford to be bullish.</p>
<p>I rhink it&#8217;s just fantastic that a company with billions in the bank can basically force consumers into adopting their failed products by paying manufacturers to put it on their TV&#8217;s.</p>
<p>If they can get it into people&#8217;s homes by brute force, developers will make it interesting. If anything I would just be glad that there is one unified platform. The current smart tv situation is much much worse. You always need a separate box for anything good.</p>
<p>Maybe in this case android could end the fragmentation of smart tvs.</p>
<blockquote>Maybe in this case android could end the fragmentation of smart tvs.</blockquote>
<p>You mean like how Android ended the fragmentation of smartphones?</p>
<p>Joking aside, it would be very nice to see an end to fragmentation, but in the case of smart TVs, I just don&#8217;t see it happening from Google. The only way I see fragmentation ending is if one company ever dominates the market. And there are too many incumbents for that to happen.</p>
<p>well, maybe it was the manufacturers like Samsung and HTC that pushed to make their OWN version of Android. I don&#8217;t think Google wanted to say no at that point since they wanted to SPREAD Android.</p>
<p>Now that a lot of people use some kind of Android OS, the Ice Cream Sandwich should be able to lessen the fragmentation. As more and more ICS phones come out, it&#8217;s going to unify everything.</p>
<p>I am guessing that was their plan?</p>
<p>Fragmentation is about more than custom UIs. With a custom UI it is still possible to be completely cross compatible with the functionality and applications that are built in to and run on other Android devices.</p>
<p>Fragmentation is about a phone you bought brand new two months ago not getting an update to the latest version of Android at the time of release, or ever for that matter. It&#8217;s about Motorola and Sony both admitting that <i>none</i> of their pre-existing phones will be getting ICS for months after it&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>Supporting a software platform with dozens of different phones running three or four different version numbers, all released within a year of each other is no good for developers.</p>
<p>Really, Schmidt? So within the next five months over 50% of new T.V.s available will have Google baked in? That&#8217;s not easy to believe, but okay.</p>
<p>Sony is on board. Vizio is getting on board. Word is Samsung is getting into GTV. Its very possible they could do the same thing with Android phones (become a top OEM) with GTV.  Who is left (that matters)? Toshiba? Sharp?  Just saying its possible.</p>
<p>Half is hyperbole. But you&#8217;re right, the top manufacturers will be supporting them in 2012 so there&#8217;s no reason they can&#8217;t take a chunk of the smart TV market.</p>
<p>Will <em>every</em> Sony have Google baked in? Every Samsung? Every Vizio? Or is each likely to stick a token toe into the water given Logitech&#8217;s highly publicized losses in the last year&#8217;s GTV rollout?</p>
<p>Given the lack of demand for existing GTV solutions, these guys would have to be crazy to offer GTV in even a quarter of their SKUs. It won&#8217;t be easy (read: mathematically possible) to reach 50% with those numbers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait for CES to see how aggressive the manufacturers will be. Sometimes its better to jump in the pool. Honestly, I hope they go all in. I just bought a Samsung Smart TV on black friday and something needs to be done.  I love the TV but the Smart party is seriously lacking in performance. Netflix is absurdly slow.  Im better off using my PS3.  They have a chance now to change the game instead of reacting to whatever Apple comes up with. Which im sure will be a simple and smooth experience.  I honestly would buy a Revue right now if GTV had the apps.  It makes no sense for the UFC TV app to allow you to order PPVs  on phones and there isnt a GTV app yet.</p>
<p>Any product manager worth a damn would stay far, far away from GTV given the proven failure, financially and in the court of public opinion.  Having said that, I&#8217;m sure the top notch product managers at Sony will dive right in.</p>
<p>Judging from reviews of the latest update,  the problem seems to be there is no content, not the experience.</p>
<p>And guess what, if they force it into every home, the content will come. If you were a developer, would you rather build an app for a universal platform or for every manufacturers proprietary smart tv framework. If they play their cards right, this might just happen. Though the timeline seems very short.</p>
<p>i agree with everything  you just said.</p>
<p>I am sure logitech CEO disagrees with you &#8230;</p>
<p>Logitech took a terrible approach to the product. Google didn&#8217;t have it completely ready, The content providers stripped away their products and killed it&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>There were a lot of reasons why GTV didn&#8217;t take off.</p>
<p>Shoe-horning it into every TV, with minimal to no added cost, is a much better strategy</p>
<p>Panasonic is a prettyt big player as well</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a 65&quot; Panny Plasma myself :)</p>
<p>The thought of Google TV and possibly having access to information/statistics regarding my viewing habits is making me cringe.</p>
<p>Here here!</p>
<p>Samsung, Sony and LG cover most TV sales globally. All they have to get is LG, and they&#8217;re golden.</p>
<p>Just seemed quick to me, that&#8217;s all. Who knows how long this has been in the works, I suppose, but I guess I would have assumed something of more substance would already have been revealed as to what we can expect. If something has come out, maybe I missed it, I haven&#8217;t followed Google TV so much lately. Mostly, talk of TV tech just bums me out, of all the tech envy I hold, I enjoy TV envy least of all, having just picked up a lovely 58&quot; Samsung less than a year ago.</p>
<p>I think they need to focus on making a compelling product before lining up hardware partners. At least, that won&#8217;t be sufficient.</p>
<p>My guess is that he meant 50 percent of TV&#8217;s with Google TV on them already will have users that actually use the services.</p>
<p>Or 50% of users of Google TV&#8217;s will be baked like he is</p>
<p>Or 50% of the people who own Google TV products won&#8217;t return them.</p>
<p>Or 50% of the people who own Google TV will be aware that they paid a premium for Google TV.</p>
<p>I got the 46&quot; Sony Google LED TV for 600 bucks at Best Buy a few months ago (granted due to a 4 hour pricing error but still). I got the tv cheaper than I could get a comparably sized LCD and I use the google apps every day.</p>
<p>Well, you said it was a pricing error, so I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re trying to say.</p>
<p>They can afford to lose money.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine their Google TV product being embedded without some great incentives from Google at this point, apps or not.</p>
<p>The incentive is that you don&#8217;t need to write a total OS for your TV and develop all the apps that they ship with currently. You just install Android and you&#8217;re done. It saves a lot of development costs for the manufacturers.</p>
<p>The problem&#8212;and the reason it&#8217;s been a failure, so far&#8212;is &#8220;to what end?&#8221; You can put Google TV on your new flatscreen, but why? Customers aren&#8217;t seeing a reason to shell out the extra $300. Many of those that thought there were good reasons used the service and changed their mind. The idea that Google TV has been going well and will expand even further is pretty hard to believe. Even TiVO is taking it on the chin.</p>
<p>An extra $300?</p>
<p>Maybe it was only because it was black friday, but my girl friend bought a 32&quot; 1080p LED Sony Google TV for only $50 more than this other 32&quot; 720p LCD TV she was considering. She really didn&#8217;t care that it had Google TV, in her mind she paid $50 more for it being LED and 1080p.</p>
<p>She loves Google TV and browses facebook/tumblr on it all of the time. The only problem with it, is that it is the only computer (yes I said computer instead of TV) in the house that you can&#8217;t stream TV over the internet on (e.g. hulu.com cbs.com). Stupid providers are blocking it because they &#8220;don&#8217;t have the rights to stream to TVs.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they move to a cheaper CPU, they&#8217;ll definitely get closer to all other devices. Today&#8217;s smart TVs already can handle Android. My 2y/o Philips smart TV is Linux based</p>
<p>The stupid providers are accustomed to having licensing deals and some pocket change to go with it.  Google didn&#8217;t want to pay anything, but they wanted to get something from their licensing deals with the t.v. manufacturers.</p>
<p>Those incentives Google is likely paying are a small price to pay for world domination.</p>
<p>True, it worked for Microsoft.</p>
<p>Mashed Potatoes</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just nip this one in the bud shall we&#8230;</p>
<p>Umm, so the majority of TVs are gonna have SOCs or Atoms built in by next summer.  That truly is news!</p>
<p>What do you think Smart/Connected TVs run on now? A little hamster running on a wheel?</p>
<p>They <em>already</em> use SoCs.</p>
<p>Smart TV&#8230; what an ironic term.</p>
<p>&#8230;but I missed the part where the majority of TVs are smart TVs.  Please find that for me, a cursory Google search seems to have missed that declaration as well.  And I should have clarified, even the smart TVs that exists run very rudimentary apps, and surely aren&#8217;t powered by anything remotely powerful enough to run ICS/Honeycomb and their apps.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about the TV thing, but I agree with the app development.  I think Android will be 1st in line soon and iOS second for developers.</p>
<p>Not anytime soon bro. While Android holds the largest smartphone marketshare,  the Android ecosystem still trails the entire iOS ecosystem. Developers look at ecosystems. Right now develop an for the iPhone and it works on iPod touch and to lesser extent on the iPad. Developers can also choose to make more money by making more robust iPad offerings and charging individually for it. They can also create a universal app that is paid for once and supports all devices. Apple leads in the tablet and PMP market and with iOS holding over 80% of the marketshare and that makes it very attractive to developers. It The iPod Nano and Apple TV both run iOS and could one day run apps, this would make the iOS ecosystem even more attractive. Not to mention the Mac, which many iOS developers now develop new apps for as well as more robust companion apps for their mobile app counter parts.</p>
<p>Right now Android only has Smartphone marketshare going for it,. Android Developers I know, like the ones that make Infinity Blade are waiting to see how Google address piracy on Android as well as Fragmentation with Ice Cream Sandwich.</p>
<p>If Google can address the fragmentation, Piracy, grab higher tablet share and maybe some TV share, it would become a very interesting platform for developers as it would more of connected ecosystem with more ways for them to make money.</p>
<p>Over 80% of Marketshare when including iPhone, iPod touch, iPad I meant. Apple can increase this by eventually expanding iOS to other segments such as Apple TV and more PMPs like the iPod Nano.</p>
<p>Piracy is just as much of a problem with with iOS and developing apps specific for iPad is also a form of fragmentation&#8230;</p>
<p>Android has greater market share, a huge and easy to use app market (which I believe you can make better margins on as a dev).  Why is that ecosystem any different than iOS other than it its strict control and limited device selection?</p>
<p>&#8220;iPad is also a form of fragmentation&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, we really need to define what fragmentation actually is.</p>
<p>Piracy is less of problem on iOS than is Android. These are not my words look up the developers that refuse to bring apps to it because of lax control.</p>
<p> iOS requires jailbreak that installs Cydia. 10% of iOS users jailbreak and maybe 5% of those jailbreakers go on to install the repo&#8217;s needed to pirate apps. Once you have the repo you have to search for the apps and download them from file sharing sites and then install them. You have to do this to update them as well. To most this is just to much of hassle except for the people that refuse to buy any software. On Android the process of piracy is much easier, plus there is also the risk of someone copying your app for malicious purpose.</p>
<p>They have smartphone market share and that is it,  Android has no significant Marketshare in the tablets, TVs, or  the PMP market yet.</p>
<p>iOS has an ecosystem of devices that give it a total marketshare of over 80%. Which is higher than the total marketshare held by Android. When Google catches up in Tablets, Android becomes more attractive to developers and if they get the TV thing off the ground that will be even better for developers.</p>
<blockquote>iOS has an ecosystem of devices that give it a total marketshare of over 80%</blockquote>
<p>Hey&#8230; How&#8217;s that cave where you lived for the last year?<br />
Latest numbers:<br />
Android &#8211; 200mil (45%)<br />
iOS &#8211; 250mil (55%)</p>
<p>There are apps that you see the Android updates first already &#8211; the new Netflix, for instance. I know there&#8217;s at least on other high profile one I&#8217;m missing.</p>
<p>When a developer pushes an update to a platform doesn&#8217;t necessarily reflect the developer&#8217;s feelings about that platform or how important it is to the developer&#8217;s business. It can (and often is) something as simple as having to wait for the App Store to approve the update, whereas the approval process for the Android Market is almost non-existent. What we&#8217;re talking about here is development for Android before iOS, which rarely happens. Instagram is still not on Android.</p>
<p>also.. only because more android phones are being sold, does not mean, that all the users actually use them as iOS users use their smartphones! the number of android users actually downloading and using apps (or even just browsing) is minuscule compared to iOS users.. which is also backed by many statistics..</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just a fair amount of fanboyism at play too, Instagram in particular.</p>
<p>There is no real reason for it not to be on the platform. It&#8217;s free, the way they make money can&#8217;t be &#8216;pirated&#8217;, with the APIs they&#8217;d need fragmentation shouldn&#8217;t be a major issue because those haven&#8217;t changed much at all.</p>
<p>You think the Instagram guys are keeping their App iOS exclusive right now is because they are &#8220;fanboys&#8221;? That&#8217;s a weird way to run a business.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called focus. They were a 10 person team and were focussed on properly scaling their iOS operation. And now they&#8217;ve hired 2 more devs who are working on the Android port. Apple fans are smart first (otherwise they would be buying Android crap), fanboy second.</p>
<blockquote>Apple fans are smart first (otherwise they would be buying Android crap), fanboy second.</blockquote>
<p>It certainly appears so&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>the approval process for the Android Market is almost non-existent</blockquote>
<p>How did &#8220;almost&#8221; get into that sentence? There is no approval process &#8211; period. There is automated malware scanning&#8230;.</p>
<p>I really doubt that. Android has a greater installed smartphone base and that&#8217;s about it. Profitability? iOS. Unified hardware specs, and addressable market? iOS. App attachment rate? iOS. Penetration in all three mobile categories (media player, phone, tablet)? iOS. Gaming? iOS. Overall OS installed base? Arguably still iOS (with iPad and iPod Touch, 250 million; Android, 200 million), but I&#8217;ll concede that that&#8217;s a toss-up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not hating; Android has its legitimate strengths such as hardware diversity, freedom of app installation, and some feature advantages (e.g. turn-by-turn). But its app scene is an unprofitable mess. But it&#8217;s a huuuge stretch to say that developers are going to suddenly prioritize Android.</p>
<p>How long till we have an update where he &#8220;clarifies&#8221; what he meant?</p>
<p>I give you&#8230; the new Ballmer!!</p>
<p>I always thought Ballmer was the new Schmidt. I think we&#8217;ll have to look at the history books to settle this one. Who started saying crazy stuff first? Anyone know?</p>
<p>Ballmer owns that title.  Eric is the padewan on that crazy farm.</p>
<p>I think he missed something. The majority of _______ TV&#8217;s is probably what he meant. Probably Samsung TV&#8217;s since Samsung is already so deep in Android.</p>
<p>I have to wonder, though, how Logitech&#8217;s public decision to drop Google TV and bash it for not selling units will affect TV deals.</p>
<p>Samsung is also deep in 3D and the current connected apps platform which ironically despite being shite has more apps than Google TV.</p>
<p>Eh, Logitech didn&#8217;t make any TVs, they made a computer that you connect to your existing TV and use it to stream content from the Internet. Considering sites like hulu.com block GoogleTV, it really wasn&#8217;t able to bring streaming from the Internet to your TV like it was supposed to. So at $300 you were better off getting a HTPC (you can get a cheap one for about $300) running Windows 7, and you would be able to stream content from the Internet (e.g. hulu.com) to your TV room.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;re looking to buy a new TV and there are two TVs, that are both 1080p, both are LED, both are the same size, but one has Google TV and the other doesn&#8217;t, and they cost the same, which one are you going to pick? Probably the Google TV one.</p>
<p>Nice trollface, Eric.</p>
<p>hahaha.. love it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind CEO being positive about their company, but better appstore than ios? majority of new tvs? come on man, thats a bit too far</p>
<p>A reminder: he&#8217;s not the CEO anymore.</p>
<p>Yeeesh, that was a bad one. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Does anyone get the feeling that Eric Schmidt is Google&#8217;s Joe Biden?</p>
<p>Remember guys&#8230; Google TV is a marathon. Not a sprint.</p>
<p>&#8220;He went on to say that the quality of apps in the Android Market was just around the corner from overtaking that of Apple’s App Store&#8221;</p>
<p>This seems like an even more insane thing to say. Based on what, Eric?</p>
<p>At least he believes in his company. That&#8217;s healthy.</p>
<p>Games are better on IOS but I have yet to year of an app on the iphone that I want that I can&#8217;t get on Android.  Also, the google apps on android are far better than anything apple provides.</p>
<p>Most New Tv&#8217;s already include Media options which are important in adding value to the customer. I can only imagine how expensive they are to produce . My question is why would a TV manufacture not use Google TV?</p>
<p>Differentiation.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Apple&#8217;s NFC patents revealed on some site early last year and then Google started claiming NFC capability in their 2010 summer developer&#8217;s conference. So how much impact has it made since the announcement?</p>
<p>And now they suspect Apple has something big planned in the TV space and they want to preempt that move. Google: It&#8217;s not about who came to market first. Get it?</p>
<p>this google madness has to end sometime &#8230; right? :|</p>
<p>Beware kids! We&#8217;ve got another Ballmer around!</p>
<p>Maybe he&#8217;ll throw eclairs instead of chairs. That would be sweet.</p>
<p>Schmidt is a major BS artist. No one takes him seriously.</p>
<p>Nothing of Google&#8217;s should be on the majority of anything.</p>
<p>Schmidt is not the CEO of Google, he is the executive Chairman.</p>
<p>Larry, Page is the CEO.</p>
<p>TV manufacturers make very little on them (Sony CEO says they lose money on every one). Making them Google commodity hardware like the phones is going to do what exactly?</p>
<p>I had no idea Eric Schmidt was still allowed to speak. Just as funny as ever, though.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why a ton of people who have never used a google TV continually rip on google TV.  I have the 46&quot; Sony and I absolutely love it.  Find me another TV that has an app store even close to as good.  If other major TV manufacturers get on board and have all of their smart tv&#8217;s running on the google TV platform it will explode faster than android did while starting on the G1/</p>
<p>brappl u absolutely RIGHT!!!!  I have Logitech Revue and me and my wife love it. GTV is best..</p>
<p>yeah, 3 of you love GTV, you should hug :)</p>
<p>I will hate to disappoint you guys but Eric is not Google CEO.  Just wait when Apple starts selling TVs and watch how everybody rush to use the free android. Don&#8217;t understand why you guys thing he is not being truthful.</p>
<p>Good. GoogleTV is cool but no one wants more boxes, put it IN the TV.</p>
<p>All who hate GTV ,please read reviews on Best Buy website and Amazon website. Using Logitech Revue from last three months and my whole family love Revue.</p>
<p>motorola made set top boxes</p>
<p>He does a lot of counting chickens, doesn&#8217;t he&#8230; Maybe he should do like Zuckerberg and only enjoy them once he&#8217;s got them by the legs.</p>
<p>Shoe salesman shills shoes. Details at 11.</p>
<p>I read bullish as bullshit&#8230; I think that kinda works better in a way :p</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s actually lost his mind.  That isn&#8217;t meant as sarcasm either.  Between what he said about Android and now Google TV, I seriously believe that someone needs to stage an intervention because this guy is either high as a kite or friggin insane.</p>
<p>its like saying 50% phones will have android ..who believes these kinda crap</p>
<p>From ~0% to 50% &#8230; in 6 months &#8230; that kind of crap.</p>
<p>I think he meant 50 people, not 50 percent.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/17941/android_ios_app_profit" target="_blank">http://blogs.computerworld.com/17941/android_ios_app_profit</a></p>
<p>I guess I missed the part where Android is an &#8220;unprofitable&#8221; wasteland for developers and iOS is a city with gold plated streets where money rains from the sky just for stepping inside the city walls.</p>
<p>Got the Logitech update today &#8211; the Revue&#8217;s  marketplace appears to have less content than the Sony GTV marketplace- which is weird and makes me thing Google doesn&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s doing. As to Eric Schmidt&#8217;s bold statement I think it was was poorly phrased or misinterpreted and he was actually trying to say that most of the television manufacturers will have a model with GoogleTV on it- which doesn&#8217;t seem that far fetched at this point as Sony, Samsung, Visio and LG have all announced at least one GTV modelright now. At CES I wouldn&#8217;t seem surprised if Panasonic and others join the fray while still promoting their own proprietary online app systems on other models of TVs and blu-ray hardware. I think apps on TV would be a great area for a universal standard using Google since the remaining mismash of  other TV apps appear pretty lackluster at this point. What&#8217;s an Intel 4400 SOC cost these days anyway? I can&#8217;t see not including it to raise your price $200, which is still cheaper than a crappy netbook/chromebook.</p>

<p>Under Promise and Over Deliver&hellip;</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the year for hardware innovation. I would rather see Android phones have greater tie in with the entire Googleverse thru Google now.</p>
<p>I want my phone to tell me when I am near my favorite restaurant and there is a deal or give me the Linkedin info of a guy I am meeting with.</p>
<p>Interesting, I see differently, at least on Android world.<br />
In terms of hardware, 2012 didn&rsquo;t brought anything really special from Motorola, Samsung or other players. Maybe Nokia, but them&hellip; Windows Phone.<br />
Now, just at the beginning of 2013, we get <span class="caps">HTC</span> One which is a marvel of engineering. 2013 looks extremely promise to the Android hardware market.</p>
<p>The SGS3 was from 2012. That was, and still is, a very impressive device.</p>
<p>We also had the <span class="caps">HTC</span> One X and the LG Nexus 4. Motorola&hellip; well, we had the next iteration of the Razr Maxx (HD version). That&rsquo;s the larger Android pieces I can think of. Nokia had a nice showing too.</p>
<p>Really, it was all very good hardware. The unfortunate part is that Samsung is the only one actually making any sales worth talking about. I think that&rsquo;s all everybody wants to see: more competition to the gorilla that is Samsung.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what amazing spectacle people expect to see every year. Everybody&rsquo;s devices are more or less iterative anymore. They all have high-resolution screens, plenty fast CPUs, big memory, etc. Apple got a taller screen but other than that, iteration. That&rsquo;s also a good thing. We&rsquo;re seeing a lot more power from everybody but it seems like people fully expect to be blown away every single year, and they don&rsquo;t necessarily need to be: even the cheap hardware is pretty fast next to what was considered high-end a year or two ago.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see Motorola make a return in a big way, though. <span class="caps">HTC</span> as well. More marketing efforts needed? I didn&rsquo;t think their hardware were &ldquo;flops&rdquo; by any sense of the word, after all.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t out my finger on it but the Moto designs just don&rsquo;t appeal to me. The <span class="caps">HTC</span> One X and Lumia 9XX models looked great in pictures but not when I went to the store and used them. The SGS3 and Note 2 were better in the store than in the pictures once I got to use it and felt better than most of the others.</p>
<p>Wow, I feel exactly the same :-) went ever i see people talking about the design of Nokia&#8217;s lumia phones I just don&#8217;t get it.. <br />
The lumia and n9 which I tested just didn&#8217;t appeals to me, and i will take a sungs or one&#8217;s at anytime ;-)</p>
<p>Coming from a person that has owned the GS3 I didnt feel it was impressive in the slightest. Samsung continually shows they are interested in copying Apple on software, but refuse to even try to make something great in hardware and it really shows. The GS3 was horrid (at least in my opinion) and the cheap brushed metal look made it even worse. Don&rsquo;t dress it up its nothing, but cheap plastic. I hate the way that Samsung devices creek they really don&rsquo;t feel like high end devices at all and as someone that used to really like Super <span class="caps">AMOLED</span> displays I have to say they look awful when companies like Apple, Nokia, and even <span class="caps">HTC</span> are wowing us with great displays. Samsung has really surprised me that they are even in the situation they are in when everything looks and feels cheap on their phones. TouchWiz feels like it belongs in a kids coloring book (which the high contrast of the <span class="caps">SAMOLED</span> display only magnifies this problem), and like I said the cheap plastic and how big their phones have become made it almost comical to use at times. I&rsquo;m hoping for something much more from them with the IV and Note 3 as <span class="caps">HTC</span> has clearly stepped their game up and their hardware is gorgeous.</p>
<p>Did Samsung kill your dog or something?</p>
<p>Did Samsung <em>buy</em> you a dog or something?</p>
<p>Are you Samsung&rsquo;s dog?</p>
<p>I keep hearing about this &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; plastic, yet the &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; plastic is used for a good reason. If you prefer the feel of glass or metal better, fine, but the plastic used is insanely durable and flexible, and it will stand up to lots of wear&rsquo;n&rsquo;tear. It by no means makes the device &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; or means it has a bad build quality.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer the &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; plastic over something like glass. It&rsquo;s the only reason I&rsquo;m not holding a Nexus 4.</p>
<p>Other than having been recently released from capture, and you just removed the blindfold, why do you need your phone to tell you you are near your favourite restaurant?</p>
<p><span class="caps">EDIT</span>: it just occurred to me you may be talking about restaurant chains. Never mind&hellip;</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand why Larry and Sergey would speak so enthusiastically about redefining UI and our interaction with devices and then wait two years to do anything about it. I want a moonshot!</p>
<p>One word: glass.</p>
<p>So is this a complete lie? <a href="http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/435031/20130214/telstra-exec-tips-motorola-x-phone-game.htm#" target="_blank">http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/435031/20130214/telstra-exec-tips-motorola-x-phone-game.htm#</a>.US-n1e6G18E or this <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/31/3937810/motorola-job-listing-confirms-x-phone-project" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/31/3937810/motorola-job-listing-confirms-x-phone-project</a> ?</p>
<p>Phones aren&rsquo;t designed overnight. If Motorola is working on an X phone and they are just now hiring engineers for it, then it will certainly be a long way off.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t an engineer, it was a product manager.</p>
<p>If he needs to think up the project first, then its even worse.</p>
<p>No a product director is sometimes the person who deals with production and getting it on the market.</p>
<p>If they are only just getting around to hiring a design manager then this &ldquo;X Phone&rdquo; is very early in development. I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt we dont see this thing for another 9-12 months if even that. It matches pretty close to this article.</p>
<p>It says that the first truly google inspired motorola phone is months out at aleast. fits right in with both your links.</p>
<p>Apparently they have 18 months of product that they have to drain so from May 2012, we&rsquo;ll have to wait until this November until the last pre-google products are completely drained and then from then hope for a Google inspired Motorola product. So no X phone until at least 2014&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be impressive like the <span class="caps">HTC</span> One is impressive. It&rsquo;s up to you whether that is <span class="caps">WOW</span>.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.product-reviews.net/wp-content/uploads/Motorola-X-Flagship-phone-for-2013-with-Android-5.0.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You like how the X also has a + in it? =op</p>
<p>Yes it is a complete lie. Because the X-Phone doesn&rsquo;t exist.  Nobody can say a damn thing about the phone except speculate on features that are not described.</p>
<p>It is going to be a rectangular device with slightly rounded corners.</p>

<p>&hellip;but I want the wow&hellip;</p>
<p>No surprise.</p>
<p>Going to be a while before Google&rsquo;s products go through R&amp;D and into production.</p>
<p>Until then it seems little more than keeping people busy &amp; things ticking over.</p>
<p>Hmm. Wonder where the X Phone rumor came from. A Moto employee exaggerating on what Moto are currently working on, perhaps?</p>
<p>Or maybe we&rsquo;ve all been a bit hasty, expecting to see the X Phone at this year&rsquo;s I/O. Maybe it&rsquo;s for 2014 release.</p>
<p>It takes 18 months to make the normal smartphone.  So if they started on day one of the purchase(I doubt they did) we would be about 9 months out.  More realistically we&rsquo;re likely at about 5 or 6 months out.  They could very well be working on the XPhone line like the rumor states but be far enough out that there is no reason to announce anything yet.</p>
<p>Thing is, I don&rsquo;t know if they started work on the X Phone the day Google formally acquired them; the day the deal went through. They could have been working on it before that, but since Google came in, they&rsquo;ve changed things around, changed things that weren&rsquo;t set in stone.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same in Formula 1 racing. If a new chief designer joins a team, he has to get all the current stuff the team are working on out of the way. So if he joins in May 2011, he&rsquo;s got to work on 2011&rsquo;s car and get it up to speed, but also inherit the designs for 2012&rsquo;s. 2012&rsquo;s design has been started, but things aren&rsquo;t set it stone, he can change some things. 2013 is the year he finally gets to work on something 100% his.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a similar situation here. Google inherited the Razr line, but it was too far along for Google to make any changes. The X Phone wasn&rsquo;t in production when the deal went through, but was already well along in the route to getting it to market; Google have changed things about it but not much. The phone after the X Phone is the phone that Google have full control over.</p>
<p>I want to hear more about your experience with Formula 1&hellip; is that what the Red Bull in your name refers to?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2tQeOcjqB0">Hmmmm&hellip;</a></p>
<p>This is also the case with Matias&rsquo; signing and Android design. Sound about right. Think he still considers his current work maybe half, or less than 50% of his total vision. I cannot wait for the next version, and hope Google somehow combines Android and ChromeOS. I rather user that across multiple form factors, or some parts of it.</p>
<p>ChromeOS will need some powerful native desktop apps to even be considered an option (Photoshop?). Still ordering the $249 Samsung Chromebook though &mdash; for light tasks and web browsing, it&rsquo;s main purpose as I see it.</p>
<p>Great analogy.</p>
<p>May 2014 is too far out for anyone to care about it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see <span class="caps">SOMETHING</span> by May I&rsquo;m sure. But this is disappointing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably just the next phone in the X series, aka Motorola Droid X3</p>
<p>This makes the most sense. The Droid X was in its day Motorola&rsquo;s flagship. They seemed to stop at the X2 which wasn&rsquo;t much of an incremental update to begin with.<br />
I gave up waiting an got a Note 2. It is basically everything I wished an X3 would be.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be hasty.</p>
<p>If not hardware, then Google can at least update the software in Moto&rsquo;s older hardware, no?<br />
The Moto Razr is still stuck in <span class="caps">ICS</span> while the Atrix won&rsquo;t even see <span class="caps">ICS</span>.<br />
Both phones have better internals than the Nexus S and can run and deserve to run the latest Android version.</p>
<p>Wow. I don&rsquo;t think Google needs 18 months from acqusition to change that.</p>
<p>Samsung <span class="caps">GSIV</span> it is then.</p>
<p>Meh, still would go Nexus 4 over it today.</p>
<p>Me too, but the camera is a deal-breaker so I went with the <span class="caps">SGSIV</span>.</p>
<p>Wait , you have the GS IV!?</p>
<p>Goddamned time travelers.</p>
<p>I traveled back in time to post this:</p>
<p>The plastic <span class="caps">SUCKS</span>!</p>
<p>I think you went through a wrong timeline there good sir. I just came back from S4 announcement, it&rsquo;s made of aluminum, and not plastic anymore. See the Galaxy S4 invitation poster? See the 4 is metallic</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L_GO6PII_ow/US85D56PfxI/AAAAAAAArXM/8ZljJ5IP1Dc/s1600/galaxy-s4-invite.jpg" target="_blank">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-L_GO6PII_ow/US85D56PfxI/AAAAAAAArXM/8ZljJ5IP1Dc/s1600/galaxy-s4-invite.jpg</a></p>
<p>Metal-effect plastic 4!</p>
<p>No, this time they were scared by Sony and <span class="caps">HTC</span> using much better materials, and so they step up their game this time and finally forgoes plastic. And since Touchwiz and build quality are the only major problem with Samsung&rsquo;s flagship, I guess they finally created the best smartphone ever. Except that their Touchwiz still sucks</p>
<p>God, I hope not.  I hate all these shitty metal phones.  Metal (particularly aluminum) dings, dents and scratches.  The GS3&rsquo;s polycarbonate shell is durable as fuck (from my personal experience of both materials, anyway)</p>
<p>Seriously, who decided that cheap malleable aluminum was a &ldquo;premium&rdquo; material?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not had experience with a Magnesium chassis yet.  It looks sexy, but I&rsquo;ll wait until I get a hands-on before I judge its durability.</p>
<p>No microSD card support so I passed.</p>
<p>Would still prefer an Xperia Z.</p>
<p>bang goes the X being unveiled at IO then :-(</p>
<p>It might still happen. Just won&rsquo;t be as impressive as we originally thought it would.</p>
<p>Read my reply to rougegoat; it might help explain my reasoning.</p>
<p>Yep good analogy with the F1 scenario. There is always a chance but all being equal its probably a november launch in time for the crucial holiday sale period.</p>
<p>november launch doesnt make an sense at all.</p>
<p>It has in the past: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/products/galaxy-nexus-gsm/2946" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/products/galaxy-nexus-gsm/2946</a></p>
<p>Why not? A Q3/Q4 launch would definitely make sense.</p>
<p>Finally! At least people will shut up about it now&hellip; Sometimes we have to use common sense when dealing with rumors.</p>
<p>Oh dear</p>
<p>That needs to change soon otherwise Google is going to loose Android to Samsung, Google needs to put Moto into overdrive to get a S4 competitor out there, the Rumored X Phone should be, but with this new report the odds look very grim.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve already &ldquo;lost&rdquo; Android to Samsung in a way. We should remember that Google bought Motorola to build up their patent portfolio first and foremost, and when they did that everyone was worried about Google playing favorites to Motorola. At least so far they&rsquo;re doing the exact opposite.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say Google has lost yet, the popularity of the S4 I think will determine it, the sad thing is Motorola has some of the best hardware out of all the Android Venders, strong build quality, good battery, good specs (for when the phones were released), good cell service. Motoblur is also the lightest of Android Skins, if Google can pull a new updated Handset with top of the line specs and on <strong><span class="caps">EVERY</span> <span class="caps">CARRIER</span></strong> then they could have a serious contender.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the popularity of the S4 I think will determine it,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The popularity of Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy line has increased every generation so far. It&rsquo;s not going to magically slow down all things being the same. Samsung is already the premiere Android brand in terms of mindshare. It&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s game to lose the longer they wait to do a proper Motorola phone the way you suggested.</p>
<p>What exactly are they losing?  People act like they buy Samsung phones because of the name on the back and not because it runs Android.</p>
<p>Per the <span class="caps">OHA</span>, Samsung can&rsquo;t compete against Android unless they completely leave the <span class="caps">OHA</span>.  That means they can&rsquo;t make Android compatible devices, and can&rsquo;t claim Android compatibility; they really can&rsquo;t even mention Android unless they are doing so in a competitive fashion.</p>
<p>They could fork Android, but could make no more Android phones from that point on.  They lose everything about Android that makes it good.  The closest thing to replace it would be Amazon&rsquo;s ecosystem, which sucks.  Beyond that, as Ubuntu, and all the other me-too&rsquo;s are going to learn, the conditions which made iOS and Android rise to dominance are unique and probably unrepeatable.</p>
<p>Samsung is at the top of the hardware game.  Google is at the top of the software game.  I&rsquo;m sure they each would prefer the other wasn&rsquo;t in a such a dominant position, but neither of them is in a position to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Samsung will play around the edges with things like Tizen which don&rsquo;t break their <span class="caps">OHA</span> agreement, but they will continue to make Android phones, because thats where their money comes from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What exactly are they losing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Per <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/25/4029446/google-worried-about-samsung-dominance-of-android">this reporting</a> by The Verge/<span class="caps">WSJ</span>, Google apparently thinks that they are losing control of Android to Samsung, or basically that Samsung has more Android leverage than Google would like.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People act like they buy Samsung phones because of the name on the back and not because it runs Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re buying them for both of those reasons, I never disagreed. Samsung will never drop Google as they continue to ride that gravy train, but that&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking about. If Google wants to try and keep Samsung in check then they need to take a more active role in the development of Motorola projects, but they don&rsquo;t appear to be doing so just yet.</p>
<p>Moto also has the most locked down hardware.</p>
<p>Hopefully they won&rsquo;t with Google in charge.</p>
<p>The only Smartphone I&rsquo;ve ever personally had die was a Motorola Atrix 4G, which had its radio die 1.2 years into ownership.  Definitely gives me pause on the &lsquo;build quality&rsquo;/QA front.  Just because something /feels/ nicer, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s actually better quality.</p>
<p>No X phone for you!!! Up next <span class="caps">HTC</span> One vs GS4. So far I&rsquo;m ready to click <span class="caps">BUY</span> on the <span class="caps">ONE</span></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still feeling burned from my old Samsung Vibrant&hellip; Bloatware and slow updates would stay my hand on either one.</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding like an Apple fanboy. I think I care more about software features and deesign than I do about raw specs.</p>
<p>You care about Software features and you&rsquo;re thinking about the iPhone? IPhone is very simple to use and has a ton of apps but features is something it doesn&rsquo;t have. Try the Gs3 or Note2 for actual features. Outside Samsung no one else is trying that hard to add actual features</p>
<p>I take it that you haven&rsquo;t lived with an iPhone recently? You might be thinking of iOS 2 or 3&hellip;</p>
<p>Even self proclaimed iPhone fanboys are starting to groan about iOS, being boring and less powerful than the latest version of Android: <a href="http://www.technobuffalo.com/2012/09/17/confessions-of-a-former-apple-fanboy/" target="_blank">http://www.technobuffalo.com/2012/09/17/confessions-of-a-former-apple-fanboy/</a></p>
<p>Ironic that Apple seems to have underestimated the power of design.</p>
<p>What &ldquo;features&rdquo; that aren&rsquo;t expected to be a part of the stock OS experiences does the iPhone have?</p>
<p>Passbook, garage band, imessage&hellip; off the top of my head. Plus all the features within those &ldquo;expected apps,&rdquo; features and integrations within their camera, iphoto, itunes, contacts and safari apps. There are probably more but I have never owned an iphone or ipad.</p>
<p>During a keynote, hours are spent outlining these things. Specs are mentioned, yes, but qickly.</p>
<p>Thats your problem; you have never owned an iphone. Apple is brilliant at marketing their novelties, but in the meantime apps cannot intercommunicate, making sharing a <span class="caps">PITA</span>; there is basically no touch UI input innovation since pinch to zoom and bouncing; the homescreen looks like a <span class="caps">PALM</span> OS device from 1996, no interaction at all, and Siri, which was purchased, has been left in the dust by Now. And then there is their big innovation for 2012: iOS Maps. They put 90% of their resources to work on an inferior homegrown app just for strategic reasons.</p>
<p>My G1 was laughed away by my iPhone owning friends only 3 yrs ago. I dont see them laughing anymore&hellip; I just hear their annoyances with the limitations that iOS brings on them these days, and their frustration with iCloud syncing issues.</p>
<p>Thats cool and all but&hellip; my point still stands that i care more about the software features and apps than i do about raw specs. Which was exactly the attitude Apple has had for a while. The Nexus 4 was top-spec phone when it came out. This new crop of flagship devices will no doubt eclipse those specs.</p>
<p>But will they have all the features baked into stock android? Or will those features be obscured or overlooked when the OS is skinned? What about when the next version of Android comes out. How long after the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 will the falgship <span class="caps">HTC</span>, Samsung and Moto phones finally be upgraded?</p>
<p>These are all questions that owners of iPhones and Nexus devices don&rsquo;t have to ask themselves.</p>
<p>Well if you buy Samsung&rsquo;s flagship, you don&rsquo;t really have to worry much. Heck, even S3 4.2.2 was leaked out already, and Xperia Z and <span class="caps">HTC</span> One both came with 4.1.2. And for a 2013 smartphone, that&rsquo;s pretty bad considering that S3 came out with <span class="caps">ICS</span>, then JB 4.1 and now getting JB 4.2 soon</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is basically no touch UI input innovation since pinch to zoom and bouncing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
<p>iPhone has plenty of features that Android lacks:<br />
AirPlay (dead simple universal media streaming to external devices)<br />
Game Center (leader boards, achievements, friend management, etc)<br />
iMessage (fully integrated, automatic data messaging with read/delivery receipts that replaces with <span class="caps">SMS</span> with no effort)<br />
Universal media controls (a media control widget that controls <span class="caps">ANY</span> media on the device, whether local, streaming, or playing to an external device)<br />
Siri (a voice controlled assistant capable of having conversations, rather than simply providing results, unless Google has vastly improved Voice Search since I last checked it out)</p>
<p>I would say the gs3 and note 2 have as many features that the average person wants as the iPhone.</p>
<p>I was more referring to the way that Apple markets the iPhone more on the shoulder&rsquo;s of iOS and the features therein rather than the aount of <span class="caps">RAM</span>, processor speed, etc.</p>
<p>Also, many <span class="caps">OEM</span> spec phones lack some of the basic features of stock Android because they are still on an older version. That&rsquo;s what matters to me.</p>
<p>And this is why I stick to Nexus devices. Owned the old Evo, then and original Epic. I felt the burn and won&rsquo;t even make those mistakes again. Went Nexus S, Gnex, and now Nexus 4. Going forward, I may just stunt and get each Nexus as well as each Google-inspired Moto device each year, and rotate em through the week.</p>
<p>Features don&rsquo;t change a market.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know,  the Razr Maxx HD&rsquo;s battery life continues to <span class="caps">WOW</span> me and let&rsquo;s be honest it&rsquo;s one of the most important features, it&rsquo;s just not a sexy feature.</p>
<p>I want to buy it, the only thing is its outdated compared to most phones hardware. My dad has it and that phone just dosent die.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not outdated at all. The phone has no lag, is beautiful designed, very well-made and is still on Motorola&rsquo;s update list, so why would you say it&rsquo;s outdated? In my opinion, it&rsquo;s the <span class="caps">BEST</span> smartphone out there, way better than the &ldquo;best-seller&rdquo; Galaxy S3, which looks like a cheap toy.</p>
<p>Update list meaning what exactly? You get updates 1 year after they are released as opposed to never?</p>
<p>&ldquo;X-Phone?! Pipe the F*$% down!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well guess Im getting the GS4 afterall.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WOW</span>, like Chrome Pixel and Nexus Q? Please let Motorola create more realistic product.</p>
<p>Chromebook Pixel pretty much defines &ldquo;<span class="caps">WOW</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow, they expect me to pay as much as a MacBook Pro? Wow, that screen looks like a Retina display?</p>
<p>Hardware is &ldquo;wow&rdquo; and the price matches, yes.</p>
<p>The screen, hardware is <span class="caps">WOW</span>. That price is more like, &ldquo;<span class="caps">WTF</span>?!&rdquo; lol</p>
<p>The device certainly warrants the price. It&rsquo;s the OS that&rsquo;s holding many back.</p>
<p>If I had the money I think I&rsquo;d go for the Pixel. The 1TB Drive storage is worth it alone.</p>
<p>In terms of what I need from a laptop, the Pixel delivers pretty much what I need, now that I think about it. It&rsquo;s the perfect companion for a desktop computer running MacOS or Windows used for work/gaming.</p>
<p>Stuttering Video? Dealbreaker for me&hellip;</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s something that could be worked on. <br />
It&rsquo;s quite obviously software related considering the hardware running the thing. The only question remaining is when Google will fix it. To be honest, I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s gone on this long.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure that a fix is coming soon. For example chrome on Mac OS X always had and has stuerring almost unusable pinch to zoom and they seem to not fix that either.</p>
<p>See, $999 price tag without the storage would have be sold.</p>
<p>That an ancillary service is the biggest selling point for the device speaks volumes, I think. It&rsquo;s gimped in a few important ways (storage, slow connectivity options). The biggest wow about the Pixel is that the hardware design is almost as good as a MacBook. Which is a big achievement, but there&rsquo;s not much to the Pixel beyond that.</p>
<p>And if I had the money I&rsquo;d get one (after a topped out rMBP). If only because success or failure, it will be a cool relic in 10 years or so.</p>
<p>Skepticism aside, I think the Pixel is a big milestone for the PC industry.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather pay $79 and buy a 1TB HD. 1TB &gt;Cloud storage&lt; is Overkill.</p>
<p>Not really. Definitely for most people. Having said that, Chrome OS is a little high up into those clouds for some people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d not be able to get any work done with the Pixel.  32GB of internal storage is a joke.  Plus the OS is mostly useless.  The 1TB storage is not worth the drawbacks imho.</p>
<p>But that has nothing to do with the quality of the device.</p>
<p>Chromebook Pixel isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;<span class="caps">WOW</span>&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just a really good laptop with awesome specs, premium design and OK software.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WOW</span> would be something like the Vaio Duo 11 or The Lenovo Yogapad. Something that we have never seen/experienced before.</p>
<p>The Chrombook Pixel isn&rsquo;t realistic?</p>
<p>Wait, you&rsquo;re calling the Nexus Q or Chromebook vaporware?! Weren&rsquo;t they actually on sale&hellip; like the Pixel is <em>right now</em>??</p>
<p>This goes to show you how little Google cares about creating the wow factor compared the amount of money Moto is still raking in.</p>
<p>If they really wanted to rock the boat, they would&rsquo;ve forked out the money to intervene in the pipeline and start creating awesome stuff from the get go.</p>
<p>Sounds like you don&rsquo;t understand how much work goes into making a single phone.  Generally speaking it takes about 18 months to go from drawing board to retail sales for a phone.  Google has owned Motorola for 9 months or so.  Since they had to do some major restructuring right off the back, I&rsquo;d say that they wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to start working on a phone to their desires until about three or four months into the purchase.  That puts us at about 5 months from that point.</p>
<p>If the cleared the pipeline without something new they would lose a massive amount of money.  Do you think any company could survive with 18 months of no sales?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you think Google had some engineers working on the X phone before the Motorola purchase? It&rsquo;s not   like Larry they just woke up in August 2011 (according to Wikipedia, when he announced the intent to purchase) and said, &ldquo;Well time to purchase a large phone company for very little reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it works like that when Moto had contracts with companies that had to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t Moto running at a loss? That&#8217;s the opposite of raking money in &#8211; more like shoveling money out.</p>
<p>So more shitty Droid products until 2015. Great. What an acquisition.</p>
<p>If these products are so meh, why don&rsquo;t they just cancel them?</p>
<p>Probably Verizon.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll have parts orders being fulfilled, factories machining and building parts&hellip; pipeline&rsquo;s a very apt term, as once something start dripping down it you can&rsquo;t just cut it off, lest it blow up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just not that simple, man. I, too, would prefer they just scrap everything day 1 and start with their own vision going forward.</p>
<p>There international (outside US) smartphone presence has recently dropped to nilt, Verizon is their last life line, and not a very good one. Gotta be horrible only chugging out just <span class="caps">CDMA</span> devices, does not give you much room.</p>
<p>Seems like for of an excuse for current poor sales and to deflect the blame from Google&rsquo;s management.</p>
<p>Nathan, Google acquired Moto in May 2012. Count months to 18 (might have to use our toes) and see where you end up.</p>
<p>What I don&rsquo;t get is why they don&rsquo;t kill the dead projects and start new stuff.  They could do that if they wanted.  They need to man up and just run Motorola and stop with this half measure.</p>
<p>Money?</p>
<p>Seems like every thinks phones are design and put to market in less than a yr.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d make a great salesman.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s rather keen on the word &lsquo;pipeline&rsquo;, though.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Google&rsquo;s pipeline included the Nexus Q and Chromebook Pixel, two overpriced products I would find a hard time seeing people buying in any large numbers.</p>
<p>Why do people keep acting like the Pixel and Q are the only two hardware projects Google has worked on? They have an entire line of Nexus phones and tablets as well, plus Glass, plus the CR-48.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the whole story fits the picture dagamer34 wanted to paint.</p>
<p>Because Google itself didn&rsquo;t design that hardware, they basically partnered with someone and slapped on a Nexus logo. Just look at how similar the Nexus 4 is to the Optimus G or the Nexus 7 to the <span class="caps">ASUS</span> Memo Pad 7. As far as I know, the Pixel and Q are 100% their designs.</p>
<p>Glass, the only other one they are fully created will clock in at $1500 to start.  I seriously wonder if Google is even capable of making cost effective products.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s $1500 for an early developer edition.</p>
<p>Well yes.  But that is the only one they have mentioned a price on.  Until they announce any other price what is there to go on.</p>
<p>The 1500$ Glass is not for the average consumer.</p>
<p>Cost effective for who?</p>
<p>For the average consumer, the price/value ratio.</p>
<p>Motorola needs to be killed off and then rebranded by another fresh name. It&rsquo;s products are complete turds</p>
<p>Not really. As I said on Android police: they&rsquo;re pretty much like Apple were before Steve Jobs came back and saved them. Great hardware, some great products, amazing history, but in danger of falling down the pecking order.</p>
<p>Google can fix that.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s problem has never been product design &ndash; it has designed several wow phones (Nexus line). Its problem has always been distribution, marketing, and services. Samsung not only produces very good phones, it also markets them aggressively in every country and secures the most important carrier partnerships. Google should get better in those areas.</p>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t all the Nexus phones partnership designs?  Google has not created their own phone from scratch yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Weren&rsquo;t all the Nexus phones partnership designs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe Google designed the Nexus devices, then the OEMs manufactured them.</p>
<p>Well at least for all the Samsung ones they were &ldquo;co-developed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Well, yeah. But Google at least had some part in the design process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pegging my hopes on a Google-designed Chromephone at some point in the future.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">RAZR</span> Maxx HD isn&rsquo;t all that bad. If it were running <span class="caps">STOCK</span> Android, wearing a Nexus nameplate, I&rsquo;d pick that device up over my Galaxy Nexus or the Nexus 4. In a heartbeat&hellip;</p>
<p>Tears. </p>
<p>Tears everywhere.</p>
<p>I like my <span class="caps">RAZR</span> Maxx HD tons! But why is everyone acting so surprised? Google has mentioned and empasized many times in the past that they&rsquo;ve inherited a huge pipeline that still needs to be flushed out. We won&rsquo;t see a &ldquo;Google&rdquo; Moto phone &rsquo;til 2014.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that when Moto was crankin&rsquo; out phones left and right, everyone was like &ldquo;<span class="caps">STOP</span> Moto! Just <span class="caps">STOP</span>!&rdquo; Now that they&rsquo;ve finally focused and streamlined their efforts, everyone is now like &ldquo;<span class="caps">WTF</span> Moto!? Why haven&rsquo;t you put anything out yet!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Damned if you do. Damned if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&hellip;and let&rsquo;s keep in mind of Moto&rsquo;s ties to Verizon. Google still has to deal with that whole mess.</p>
<p>This year, I promise you that. Even the stores&hellip; it&rsquo;s too, too many times some company exec has said one things and things changed down the link. It&rsquo;s only Feb&hellip; I/O in May/June, and potential for a new Nexus and new Moto device in the fall. Too much time. Even Google claimed last year that Glass wouldn&rsquo;t be out til next year, but just recently they said it will be on sale by the end of <em>this</em> year. So&hellip; there&rsquo;s the proof in the pudding, so to speak.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a good thought to keep in mind. However, I still wouldn&rsquo;t get my hopes up.  ;-)</p>
<p><span class="caps">THANK</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span>, <span class="caps">PICHETTE</span>.</p>
<p>I never jumped on the &ldquo;X Phone&rdquo; bandwagon because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nothing (specs? renders?) was ever leaked by a credible source.</li>
	<li>See #1.</li>
</ol>
<p>I get that everyone is excited about a Googlorola phone, but it was kind of silly how all of the X Phone nutjobs started frothing and posting &ldquo;<span class="caps">OMG</span> X <span class="caps">PHONE</span> or <span class="caps">GSIV</span>?!&rdquo; threads&hellip; over nothing. A figment of your imagination. Hype out of thin air.</p>
<p>What about the job listing at Moto? Mistake or trolling?</p>
<p>There IS an &ldquo;X-Phone&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m sure of it, but it&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; phone that everyone thinks it&rsquo;ll be.</p>
<p>Exactly. I&rsquo;m sure Google and Moto are working on <em>something</em>. I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s happening anytime soon, as we would have heard something other than the name &ldquo;X Phone&rdquo; floating around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="caps">OMG</span> did u hear about X Phone?!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I know! It&rsquo;s gonna be revolutionary!!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="caps">BASED</span> ON <span class="caps">WHAT</span>, <span class="caps">PEOPLE</span>?! I love Google and all but not everything they touch turns to gold. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to own a Motorola smartphone. The RAZR&rsquo;s are nice, very thin or very good battery life, but they don&rsquo;t sway me from anything else on the market.</p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p>Google and Moto are working on a phone? <em>Together</em>?! <span class="caps">IMPOSSIBLE</span>.</p>
<p>That alone is the culmination and totality of everything we know about this &ldquo;X Phone&rdquo;. Screen size? <span class="caps">CPU</span>? Internal storage? Renders? Employees quoted saying &lsquo;no comment&rsquo;? <span class="caps">ANYTHING</span>?</p>
<p>Is there <em>anything</em> other than the name? I mean, I could toss out the word &ldquo;Galaxy S V&rdquo;&hellip; <strong>IS <span class="caps">EVERYONE</span> <span class="caps">CREAMING</span> <span class="caps">THEMSELVES</span> <span class="caps">YET</span> OR AM I <span class="caps">NUTS</span>, <span class="caps">RIGHT</span>?!</strong></p>
<p>Seriously, we got the letter &lsquo;x&rsquo; followed by the word &lsquo;phone&rsquo;, and suddenly everyone is planning their next smartphone purchase accordingly.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>i P H O N E . 5 S</p>
<p>I just made every Apple fan cum in their tight jeans with that line. Sounds a little ridiculous, don&rsquo;t it? And heck, I could probably make a few guesses at specs on that one and be totally correct.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmmksg0z6o1qe0zy3.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>To me it sounds like the next batch of RAZRs will be Snapdragon 600s. Nothing wrong with that at all, but by the time they come out (typically towards the end of the year) the <span class="caps">HTC</span> One and GS4 will have been available for months with those specs or better.</p>
<p>One of my favorite phones though is the <span class="caps">RAZR</span> M, I hope they can build on that design. They&rsquo;d be the only one truly building a smaller screen power house. If they can build that phone with a 720P display and make it work with my T-Mobile Sim I would buy it now.</p>
<p>If they make something that tops the <span class="caps">HTC</span> one on the industrial design side I&rsquo;ll get it. Honestly the <span class="caps">SIII</span> great but I&rsquo;d rather have a quick (snapdragon 600), well designed (iPhone don&rsquo;t knock it it feels worth paying out of contract) and skinless android.</p>
<p>You know what would be &lsquo;Wow&rsquo;?  A flippin&rsquo; stock Android phone w/ <span class="caps">LTE</span> and a decent camera.</p>
<p>@google &amp; Motorola:when do we get wowed by google!!unit</p>
<p>If only there were something they could do about it&hellip; Some way they could have a say in what Motorola was making and doing&hellip;</p>
<p>As for the naysayer vs google.nexus main problem is how hard it is to get one,specifically the nexus 4.if google print play gift card of 400$for big chain store?lol google will be back to square one ,so first google will need to add higher value play card at the various super center on the planet .then they will need to try to keep back order low.</p>
<p>My money&rsquo;s still on a Motorola Nexus phone, come on if Asus can do the N7 in a few months(which is a brilliant tablet), Moto should be able to do something good.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HTC</span>, Samsung, and LG have made Nexus phones.. out of the major Android manufacturers.. that leaves Moto and Sony &hellip; Huawei and <span class="caps">ZTE</span> can be counted too, I gues</p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t count Huawei and <span class="caps">ZTE</span>, considering that China does not count Google at all. Their nationalistic, extremly right-wing government only protects their national brands and bans ours. Why should we not do the same? I personally would never buy from either companies.</p>
<p>fail</p>
<p>Droid 5 please ;-)</p>
<p>The article suggests it may be several months&hellip;October is several months away. The next nexus phone?</p>
<p>Not really surprising. I think Google realizes that hardware is much a longer process then software (can&rsquo;t put a droid together at a hack-a-thon :).</p>
<p>No X-phone at I/O? I am a little disappointed (the give-aways the last few years have been awesome), but I would rather they get it right then fast.</p>
<p>So the wait for a stock Android phone with <span class="caps">LTE</span>/4G continues.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be melodramatic but this is the end of the world.</p>
<p>Makes sense. I&rsquo;m not that upset about it, I never really expected to want another Motorola product after the Droid X.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the release of Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy S IV just weeks away, it seems rumors of a growing rift between the two may have been overblown &mdash; at least for now.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been &rsquo;Wow&rsquo;d&rsquo; by Motorola in quite some time (pre-smartphones)</p>
<p><span class="caps">AWFUL</span> <span class="caps">STATEMENT</span> by the <span class="caps">CFO</span>.</p>
<p>why?</p>
<p>publicly denigrating part of your team, adopted/acquired or otherwise, undermines your leadership with the haves (the &ldquo;good&rdquo; employees who have yet to be reamed) and alienates you from the have-nots (the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; employees likely capable of the effort you&rsquo;re after if only you hadn&rsquo;t publicly scorned them).</p>
<p>this is &ldquo;inside&rdquo; banter&hellip; if it&rsquo;s banter at all.</p>
<p>this is how a bad parent would deal with the adopted kid&rsquo;s undesirable habits.</p>
<p>Or, he&rsquo;s just telling it like it is, and not trying to paint a better picture then it really is, which imo is better than those who say good things to sell stuff.</p>
<p>Telling it &ldquo;like it is&rdquo; is valuable only to people who value spectacle over virtue.</p>
<p>There was no need to &ldquo;paint a better picture&rdquo; &ndash; indeed there was no onus on him to paint any picture AT <span class="caps">ALL</span>. An interview is not a legally constrained deposition &ndash; he was free to answer (or not answer) as he wished.</p>
<p>Inasmuch, he obviously wished to put a foot in his mouth, alienate 12.5 billion worth (the value of the purchase) of his combined company&rsquo;s business, and perhaps bring on the Osborne Effect on Motorola&rsquo;s products.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>This is not a child/parent relationship. These are all adults here. And as a designer, if you can&rsquo;t take criticism, you need to find another profession. Nevermind the fact that they (Motorola&rsquo;s Design and R&amp;D departments) should be well aware of the quality of their product without someone saying so.</p>
<p>Theres no reason to believe that those who designed the product are solely responsible for its quality. At some point those come across the desk of a high-level decision maker who has to cut corners in the name of cost or some other factor. Google likel has the advantage of not having to cut as many corners, thus making it easier to buoild the phone they want to build, rather than the phone they are able to.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;wowed&rdquo; by my Razr HD but I did pick it over the <span class="caps">HTC</span> One X and Galaxy S3 a few months back. It was actually my last choice going into it, but after holding the <span class="caps">HTC</span> and Samsung phones the build quality of the Motorola stood out. It feels about as solid as an iPhone, you can&rsquo;t flex the body anywhere like I could with the <span class="caps">HTC</span> and Samsung.</p>
<p>I would like for Motorola make stock Android available retroactively though. It would be nice getting updates the same day as Nexus devices.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Just the way I like it, but please, Verge, could you link to media files if you&rsquo;re going to use players that dont work in all browsers.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re so edgy and cool</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to see the first &ldquo;wow&rdquo; Googlerola device, whenever it comes.</p>
<p>The Samsung vs Google stuff strikes me as typical mainstream media overreaction in much the same manner as Apple &ldquo;missing&rdquo; ludicrous analyst expectations is the beginning of the end. Any business worth its salt is fully aware of its strengths and weaknesses (<span class="caps">SWOT</span> analysis 101), and the Android platform&rsquo;s increasing dependence on a single manufacturer when its foundations depend on spreading the load are by far Android&rsquo;s biggest weakness.</p>
<p>With the exception of Motorola, every Android manufacturer is hedging its bets right now. HTC&rsquo;s Android division is losing ground, and they&rsquo;re pouring resources into Windows Phone (and the reception they&rsquo;ve had from Microsoft gives Nokia reason to feel uncomfortable, but that&rsquo;s another story). LG has bought WebOS and has the option to try and revive a dead platform for insurance. Samsung plays around with Windows and is moving its low-end from Bada to Tizen.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s worst case scenario is everyone besides Samsung abandons ship and then Samsung forks Android and removes their services, or just drops Android for Tizen. Currently the chances of this chain of events playing out is low, but failing to plan for drastic change in the technology sector is suicidal &ndash; look at the fall of <span class="caps">RIM</span> and Nokia for evidence of what happens when you&rsquo;re caught unawares.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it but I&rsquo;m now considering selling my Galaxy Nexus for a Nexus 4. The GN&rsquo;s camera is just so abysmal that I need an improvement before my overseas trip to Europe &ndash; and I flat out refuse to buy a non-stock Android device.</p>
<p>Just put stock android, and promise to keep phones up to date in a timely manner, then you suddenly open up a brand new market.  Take the Razr V as an example, a mid range phone with decent specs released mid last year, is still stuck on <span class="caps">ICS</span> with no roadmap forward.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Pichette in a conference in Montreal, this guy is probably one of the secret ace in the Google Team. He is able to have his head in the cloud (for future of the company, strategy and vision) and still have his feet on earth while seeing the best in its employees &amp; people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll believe anything he&rsquo;d said without any doubt. Great man.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s said this many times before on investor calls, nothing really new here.</p>
<p>Guess i can sign my life away now that the mythical Xphone is nowhere in sight. <span class="caps">HTC</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> it is. Or maybe the Galaxy S IV&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..or maybe the Nexus 5.   <span class="caps">SMH</span>.</p>
<p>Must make Motorola employees feel great that Google believes upcoming Motorola lineup needs to &ldquo;drain&rdquo; like sewage. If I was a Moto employee, I&rsquo;d be thinking that arrogant ass released Google Q and Google TV&hellip;.another &ldquo;wave of innovation&rdquo; like that, and Moto will close shop.</p>
<p>Come on, Motorola employees know damn well their phones aren&rsquo;t selling (for whatever reasons) and can&rsquo;t be shocked or upset that Google wants to &lsquo;drain&rsquo; the pipeline of their new acquisition.  In fact that&rsquo;s not shocking at all.  All companies do that when they acquire others.</p>
<p>What would have made me feel terrible, were I a Motorola employee, was watching my bosses drive the company into the ground and devalue our work to such an extent that we had to be bought out by a software company.  I would have been thrilled at the acquisition, as it would mean I would more likely get to keep my job.</p>
<p>With Google laying people off and selling off parts of Motorola, the <span class="caps">CFO</span> should show more tact &amp; class when blabbing to press. He should just say that products of Google/Motorola collaboration won&rsquo;t appear until x quarter.</p>
<p>Remember how the Atrix got a 9.0?</p>
<p>Still can&rsquo;t believe that happened.</p>
<p>Josh is probably lucky he can&rsquo;t fire himself for that.</p>
<p>Surely it would make more sense for Google to just can the current pipeline and start over? Sure, it&rsquo;s a waste of the time and money already invested in it, but it seems to make more sense than just thinking, &ldquo;Oh well, we just have to put up with 18 months of crappy products that have already been started before we can do what we really want to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that&rsquo;s what a certain former <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Apple would have done&hellip;</p>
<p>Why?  I mean, they <span class="caps">ARE</span> currently working on pure Google/Motorola stuff.  But that takes  <span class="caps">LONG</span> time to complete.  Are you suggesting they just stop work on everything else, fire millions of people who no longer had a project to work on for the next year or so?  Wouldn&rsquo;t be any cheaper, they still have contractual obligations for parts from OEMs, distribution channels to keep open, etc.</p>
<p>And no, Steve Jobs would <span class="caps">NOT</span> have shut down all production and had a year and a half of down time while completely changing the company&rsquo;s direction.  Because while he may have been an arrogant douche, he was at least a smart business man.</p>
<p>I dont understand why does Motorola not expand itself globally..Some time back this was a hugely popular phone in Pakistan,people were literally crazy to have their phones. But then came the downfall and the whole market over here like the rest the of the world became  dominated by Nokia and Samsung. If only they could market themselves in countries like Pakistan with proper partnerships they can make alot of money&hellip;Success of Blackberry and Sony phones over here is a clear indication for companies like these to make further inroads as most of the market potential remains untapped</p>
<p>Android is &ldquo;meh&rdquo; to begin with.</p>
<p>Explain why? Not giving reasoning to something like this will make people mark you out as a troll.</p>
<p>He is a troll, no reasons whatsoever. Just a blanket statement which us peasants have to be take at face value.</p>
<p>As a moderator, my duty is to improve the comments through trying to make people better commenters. Just hiding his comment from view won&rsquo;t help him or anyone else. If his comment starts a flamewar, I will of course hide it and the resulting children comments. But not now; if we can, we want to improve the state of the comments here.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons: fragmentation, jerky UI, bleeding edge but useless tech (e.g. <span class="caps">NFC</span> that dropped by Samsung, and copy Passbook instead) to name some. And now Motorola, the tool they bought for extortion (but failed miserably) produced device below their standard? Which standard? If it is Android, which is &ldquo;meh&rdquo;,  it just like the pot calls the kettle black.</p>
<p>OK. Just a few counter-points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>produced device below their standard?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The devices that are in Moto&rsquo;s pipeline have been in Moto&rsquo;s pipeline before Google bought them. as I explained near the top of this thread, Google need to get rid of all the previous Moto stuff before Google can create a device that was 100% created with 100% their involvement.</p>
<p>A lot of people like Android, including me (although I prefer Chrome OS). That it&rsquo;s &lsquo;meh&rsquo; is your opinion, and I&rsquo;m not going to refute that: there are many many places Android needs to improve. The Android team at Building 44 in Mountain View know this too.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at the current snap shot shall we? Sony, which generally lags in phone releases, has outed their flagship. <span class="caps">HTC</span> is on its <strong>second</strong> 1080p device (<span class="caps">DNA</span> being the first). Samsung will out the S4 March 14th. LG has the Optimus pro G (or whatever the hell it&rsquo;s called). And Motorola has&hellip;..umm&hellip;&hellip;well&hellip;.nothing&hellip;..  Everyone is racing to get phones out of the blocks and Motorola is asleep at the wheel. Release something, <strong>anything</strong></p>
<p>Motorola genuinely  has no flagship phones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">HTC</span> is on its second 1080p device (<span class="caps">DNA</span> being the first)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, the Butterfly was the first.</p>
<p><span class="caps">DNA</span> is butterfly version of <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather Moto take it slow and get it right than release a phone now that is bad.</p>
<p>Fair enough but now a days its a race to get the phones out <span class="caps">ASAP</span>. <span class="caps">HTC</span> early release date means that by the time Motorola gets their phone out, they might launch a new and better phone making Moto&rsquo;s new offering already obsolete. Also, their older phones can now be discounted, have better mind share, have stable build etc. Its already a struggle for Motorola even before the phone is out. Motorola is the <strong>only</strong> phone manufacturer without a flagship offering. Everyone has one (except maybe Apple).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how typical android start screen looks like: a total mess.</p>
<p>I dunno. Doesn&rsquo;t the <span class="caps">RAZR</span> Maxx line have the best battery life of all the smartphones out there? Isn&rsquo;t it also fairly feature rich? From that alone, I&rsquo;d argue that they&rsquo;re the best out there, as long as the experience is decent, having not used one myself. In comparison, something like the Galaxy S3 is absolutely stunning, but everyone I know complains about the battery life, and depending on your lifestyle, you don&rsquo;t always have the opportunity to jack in somewhere.</p>
<p>Maybe he should read this:<br /><a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-atrix-hd-tops-user-satisfaction-poll-4-top-5-devices-run-android" target="_blank">http://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-atrix-hd-tops-user-satisfaction-poll-4-top-5-devices-run-android</a></p>
<p>I hope he is not using this as an excuse to change Motorola too much. I love the <span class="caps">RAZR</span> m/i and Motorola have been the only vendor to make phones with big batteries, slim bezels, slim profiles and their new software is decent.</p>
<p>I just wish they&rsquo;d being more of their products to Europe quickly (e,g, really disappointed that Photon Q , as well as QWERTYs from other manufacturers didn&rsquo;t make it). Moto used to be really popular in Europe, but recently for some reason they&rsquo;ve chosen to retreat into a US-only shell.</p>
<p>Seriously hope whatever they announce won&#8217;t make me regret my brand new One X&#8230;</p>
<p>A probable minor-ish update to ICS, with Jellybean? I can&#8217;t see it making you regret your purchase.</p>
<p>The thing is that Google&#8217;s updates are rarely so minor. I&#8217;ve been following these updates for a long time, and even the .1 updates usually have quite a bit of new features and improvements.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping this one doesn&#8217;t dissapoint. I&#8217;m particularly hoping to see some more UI enhancements from Matias Duarte.</p>
<p>My cousin bought a Galaxy S III five days ago. I&#8217;ve already warned him that he may well become obsolete already.</p>
<p>Are phone&#8217;s announced at I/O? and even if it is, that doesn&#8217;t change the fact he&#8217;s bought what will be Samsung&#8217;s flagship device for the next 12m</p>
<p>It&#8217;s widely believe they&#8217;ll be announcing a range of Nexus devices.</p>
<p>I thought that happens later in the year; the galaxy nexus wasn&#8217;t announced until  October, it would be weird to supersede it already&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yeah I seriously doubt they will show a new Nexus in the Summer.</p>
<p>January 2010 = Nexus One<br />
December 2010 = Nexus S<br />
November 2011 = Galaxy Nexus<br />
October 2012 = ?</p>
<p>I predict a September 2013 release for the 6th nexus phone (if you count the G1)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s technically not a Nexus but it is a Google phone and if I count it then I have to count the Google Ion which did launch at Google I/O in 2009.</p>
<p>No. That&#8217;s for November, and for Android 5.0. Android 4.1 is coming at I/O, and only the tablet will be announced.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any news of a 5.0 in the fall.</p>
<p>Me neither, think we&#8217;ll obviously see 4.1 tomorrow, wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s a 4.2 for the next wave of phones&#8230; 5.0 will be considerable while</p>
<p>No. They wont be announcing any phones at IO. Oems already shown thief flagship devices for the year nothing will be announced to undercut sales&#8230;. so no. The GS3 will be top end for the next 5 to 6 months in the android world</p>
<p>And even when they do announce a new Nexus phone this November, it&#8217;ll most likely be something with similar specs to the GS III. Like the Nexus S was with the original Galaxy S in 2010 and the Galaxy Nexus with GS II in 2011. So, the GS III will still be a top end even after 5 to 6 months.</p>
<p>True, but remember that both the Nexus S and the Galaxy Nexus were made by Samsung. If someone else makes the next Nexus phone, it could very well have better specs than the SGSIII &#8211; especially if that someone doesn&#8217;t have many other high-end android offerings yet.</p>
<p>The industry is very predictable man&#8230;. no new phones today.</p>
<p>I just hope they go back to using MicroSD cards.  I can&#8217;t even consider a new phone with only 32gig :(</p>
<p>Nope. That&#8217;s November.</p>
<p>Ah &#8211; thanks for the clarification.  Feeling simultaneously disappointed and inept.</p>
<p>Oh man, I HOPE! SAME DESIGN AS GALAXY NEXUS BUT OTHER COMPANIES HTC, ASUS, SONY&#8230;</p>
<p>I just meant in terms of the potential 4.1 Jelly Bean announcement</p>
<p>JB will be more minor code improvements.  Similar to Fryo to GB and Donut to Eclair.  The big jumps at the integer numbers.</p>
<p>yeah, clearly.</p>
<p>didier it make you feel clever? ^^</p>
<p>did it make you feel clever? ^^</p>
<p>There will be nothing obsolete about the S3 any time soon.  I mean the S2 is still getting updated to ICS long after it&#8217;s initial release.</p>
<p>Definition of obsolete: no longer in general use; fallen into disuse: an obsolete expression.</p>
<p>So no&#8230;a new update does not render every other phone obsolete.</p>
<p>Check out what a Googler just shared on G+. Jellybean sculpture is here! <br />

<p>After all that, the post has been deleted&#8230; But I saw it</p>
<p>Jellybean confirmed then</p>
<p>lol, it was deleted, but Google Developers just shared it and so did another Googler.</p>

<p>LOL</p>

<p><img src="http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/epic-fail-photos-monday-thru-friday-messiness-transcends-gender.jpg" /></p>
<p>Welp, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=H6dRbuL7D1w">looking at the live schedule on here</a>, I&#8217;d say that you are safe.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I think the topics for the week are going to be:<br />
- New version of Android<br />
- New version of Google Maps<br />
- How to make moar money: a developers story<br />
- HTML 5 is great, here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing with it (featuring gaming)<br />
- Improved YouTube API&#8217;s<br />
- Web as platform is viable, you&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>I hope what they announce makes you regret your brand new One X. And me mine.<br />
It would also be nice if they announced a proper update alliance.</p>
<p>Wow. 11:30 PM central time?</p>
<p>These time zones&#8230; I tell ya.</p>
<p>ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZING!</p>
<p>is that correcto or not?</p>
<p>Sorry about that, fixed!</p>
<p>I know! Here in Japan I have to wait another whole day!</p>
<p>so i wonder when ill actually be able to buy the tablet. im sure rigth ordering after the keynote is out of the question</p>
<p>Google- give us a price and date for your tablet. Thanks.</p>
<p>The difference will be that Google actually has a working, production ready, tablet instead of an early prototype.</p>
<p>dare I say, was that a shot at Surface?  Perish the thought.</p>
<p>My dream: Galaxy Nexus gets Jelly Bean from day 1, Nexus S in Q3.</p>
<p>gsm version will get it very quickly I&#8217;m sure. us cdma folks will probably be a month behind.</p>
<p>and by month you mean six, for Verizon to look at it</p>
<p>My dream&#8230; Someone other than Samsung making Nexus devices.</p>
<p>Asus is making the tablet.</p>
<p>Yup, but phones</p>
<p>They&#8217;re apparently prepping 5 Nexus devices made by different manufacturer&#8217;s, to be announced in October/November.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed&#8230; Would be awesome if the market was flooded with un-skinned devices</p>
<p>Yeah, it would!</p>
<p>Actually I dream of dual boot phones. Best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Dammit, that apostrophe doesn&#8217;t need to be there. *manufacturers</p>
<p>nothing was said that the 5 devices would be phones</p>
<p>The wallop street journal mentionned a rumor of 5 nexi manufacturer. It may become a reality soon!</p>
<p>unlocked Nexus phones in EU &amp; Asia have been enjoying this from the start.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping that Project Glass and self-driving cars will be available everywhere immediately following the keynote.</p>
<p>In truth though, I (not so) boldly predict that my Galaxy S II will become even further behind the curve with no help in sight from AT&amp;T&#8217;s end!</p>
<p>I think after a phone is a year old, it&#8217;s definitely time to start looking at Rooting and Custom ROMs. Manufacturer support after a year basically starts drying up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you will be able to get Jelly Bean on the Galaxy S II that is rooted in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been less excited about a Google announcement before&#8230; O_o</p>
<p>Microsoft got my soul with the announcements last week xD</p>
<p>Poor one^^</p>
<p>Oh don&#8217;t give your soul to Microsoft.  That tends to end badly.<br />
Getting dragged screaming down into hell and all of that&#8230;.</p>
<p>um, why would you <strong>read</strong> the live stream when you can <strong>watch</strong> it? <a href="https://developers.google.com/io?utm_source=io-site&utm_medium=emb-io&utm_campaign=io-site" target="_blank">https://developers.google.com/io?utm_source=io-site&amp;utm_medium=emb-io&amp;utm_campaign=io-site</a></p>
<p>Because someone (like me) is more interested in checking in every couple of minutes while they work rather than dedicating the whole amount of time to actually watching and paying attention.</p>
<p>Fair enough &#8211; I&#8217;ll be watching it @6:30PM (CET), so giving it my full attention.</p>
<p>You didn&#8217;t request off for this???</p>
<p>Because I can&#8217;t watch it at work (blocked). Even if I could, my boss would likely frown upon me watching a video feed instead of working.</p>
<p>Which is why I&#8217;m going home on my lunch break tomorrow to watch it.</p>
<p>wow. you are apparently excited.</p>
<p>something doesnt add up. in the live link from google there is a count watch that says the live event will start in ~5 hours.<br />
but according to the time in this article it seems that it is on two hours earlier&#8230;what is correct?</p>
<p>My prediction: this new Nexus tablet will be the giveaway to Google I/O attendees.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a zero entropy prediction.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>Is it just me or are they delayed?</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Lzm6O.jpg" /></p>
<p>Vic&#8217;s the man!</p>
<p>hes a pretty good presenter.</p>
<p>I particularly love it when he out and out Zings Apple. Someone&#8217;s got to.</p>
<p>Does he have a moon orbiting his head?</p>
<p>Yes, cos his brain is the size of a planet.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qyE0m.gif" /></p>
<p>Sorry Google, but I will watch Portugal-Spain tomorrow.</p>
<p>The keynote starts at 16:30 GMT, so it will likely be over before the match starts (at 18:45 GMT).</p>
<p>17:30</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>London isn&#8217;t on GMT, contrary to what you might think. At least not during the summer months.</p>
<p>Oh. sorry. It&#8217;s 07:30PM by Kyv, and the match will start on 09:45PM.</p>
<p>*Kyiv.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the Indian time?</p>
<p>I took the time to find out for you. It&#8217;s 10PM in India.</p>
<p>Usually about 2 hours after the time written on the invitation, from experience.</p>
<p>Dear VERGE, please do something like Engadget does to show the local time.</p>
<p>P.S: by the way the Indian time is 10:00 pm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/06/26/google-i-o-2012-kicks-off-tomorrow-get-your-liveblog-right-here/"></a></p>
<p>Yay!  <strong>2:30am</strong>!  That&#8217;s what I get for living on the wrong side of the planet.</p>
<p>Ummm&#8230;. I think I might just read about it when I get up in the morning.</p>
<p>Lets wait for yet another revelation of yet another tablet. Oh how exciting! We need at least two dozens of articles about it as well, just like the surface one got!</p>
<p>Well, yeah.  Of course.<br />
The</p>
<p><em>&#8230; I seem to have hit ENTER by mistake.  Ummm, what was I going to say again?</em></p>
<p>you can go to youtube.com/live to see the whole thing live.</p>
<p>So, Google will be announcing another tablet they won&#8217;t be able to sell in the US, then?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18605456" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18605456</a></p>
<p>Live streaming beings at 1:18ET but live blog starts at 12:30?</p>
<p>They like to talk about the whole experience, starting from getting there and waiting in line.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s what i figured but that&#8217;s a really random time for google to begin it&#8217;s live streaming. And is it really going to take over 45 mins to get in and sit down?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2/jtr.jpg" /> This is gonna be huge, this has been google&#8217;s mission for years.<img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2fj/fvx.jpg" /></p>
<p>Nice. Looking forward to trying it out on my way to Mildura this evening.</p>
<p>This was the only thing I was missing from my iPhone 5. Now that I have access to a decent Google maps experience I can wait patiently for iOS 7.</p>
<p><em>Yeah, a good reason to ditch Android and buy an iPhone, better maps.<br />
</em><br />
Covers head with hands and runs for the door&#8230;</p>
<p>He was not even mentioning Android. Why do you reply to him?</p>
<p>He replied to my comment and I replied to his&#8230;it is slightly off topic but I was just having a little joke about the fanboy wars.</p>
<p>The Apple maps icon just found a new home at last screen of my iPhone in a folder along with the stock app.</p>
<p>Thanks Google!</p>
<p>x2!</p>
<p>Poor guys sorting out their buttons and folders</p>
<p>I can see it now.</p>
<p>Before Google Maps for iOS: Man, Google is dropping the ball! What&#8217;s the problem?<br />
After: Lol now one less reason to change away from Apple, thanks Google!</p>
<p>Glad to see that the complaints about a native app will evaporate now.</p>
<p>The best thing Apple did with iOS 6 was remove Google maps &amp; YouTube. It allowed Google to make the Apps &amp; iOS more robust &amp; beautiful.</p>
<p>And most importantly free. (If you don&#8217;t discount the bad press, the efforts put into its own &#8220;Maps&#8221; etc.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually a really good point.</p>
<p>So Apple has the credit for this now?</p>
<p>Well yea.  Google would not have done a tenth of what they did with the new Maps app if they had gotten a free ride from Apple like they&#8217;ve been getting over the past few years.  Competition is good.</p>
<p>Google had nothing to do with the old app.</p>
<p>well, that&#8217;s completely untrue. You think apple wouldn&#8217;t have implimented turn by turn on iOS 5 google maps if they were allowed too?</p>
<p>insanity. </p>
<p>It <strong><em>was</em></strong> a good move by apple.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s generally accepted that Google did not want turn by turn on iOS in Apple&#8217;s Maps implementation with Google&#8217;s mapping data. Google wanted the feedback but was not getting it with Apple&#8217;s app.</p>
<p>Now that Apple dumped Google&#8217;s map data, Google is free to release their version of Google Maps with turn by turn. The difference is that Google was not getting the maps feedback from Apple&#8217;s Maps app but they do with their own map app.</p>
<p>Google is all about interacting directly with the user, giving them value in apps and services and getting data feedback about what the user is doing. Now they can do that.</p>
<p><strong>no</strong>, it&#8217;s widely known they got stuck over some major negotiating points, mostly latitude.</p>
<p>can you imagine the nerve of apple not wanting google to keep tabs on the current locations of their users? SUCH NERVE!</p>
<p>It is the consumer that makes the choice to allow for this location awareness. Apple in this case does keep tabs on the location of the user, but didn&#8217;t want to give google access to the same information.</p>
<p>Plus, Google can integrate their other services in the apparently now providing a better overall experience.</p>
<p>&#8230;in the app&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>but didn’t want to give google access to the same information.</blockquote>
<p>And why should they? Google is just another third party, like Rovio or Microsoft.</p>
<p>Because Apple obviously needs them to not get lost in the Outback of Australia.</p>
<p>Your reply has nothing to do with mines. So I assume it&#8217;s a mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s users&#8221;? They are people that happen to own an Apple-manufactured device. They are not <em>Apple&#8217;s users</em>, and Apple should have zero say in what they do on their own devices, or what location information they choose to share. Apple&#8217;s control (and influence) over the user&#8217;s behavior should end at the point of purchase.</p>
<p>I think this basic disconnect with regard to individual agency is one of the major differences between people that blindly adhere to Apple&#8217;s walled-garden worldview, and those who see it as an intentional impediment to free individual computing. The device is the user&#8217;s property, to do with as they like, and any attempt to curtail that freedom is an affront to the user&#8217;s rights.</p>
<p>Sure.  But having the DEFAULT mapping application directly feed into another company so they can data mine?  That&#8217;s just dumb.  Apple made the move they had to make, and Google has made theirs by releasing their app.  Now it&#8217;s up to each company and the users.  I don&#8217;t see how failure to give a certain company a leg up with first party app status on Apple&#8217;s own devices somehow impinges on &#8220;users rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was talking about Latitude, not Maps in general. Apple didn&#8217;t want the Latitude feature to be available to users, and Google did. It&#8217;s always disabled by default, even on Android.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by the &#8220;another company&#8221; thing. Why should Apple OR Google be entitled to mine the user&#8217;s data by default? Shouldn&#8217;t the user be able to choose which mapping service they prefer, and which features they desire to use, and therefore decide who gets to see their data?</p>
<p>Are you saying there would have been a way to use a Latitude enabled Google Maps program without actually submitting data to Google for Latitude?  Because I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;d have been opted in without recourse, in the default mapping application.  That would have been an unacceptable situation.</p>
<p>If you think Apple and Google data mine for the same purposes and intentions, then you&#8217;re not following the space.</p>
<p>Latitude is opt-in, it does not operate by default at all.</p>
<p>In fact, all location services on Android are opt-in. You can choose on initial setup whether you want Google to be able to see your location at all, and you can disable it after the fact if you change your mind later. This is separate from the GPS function, which can be used independently of the OS-integrated location-driven data services.</p>
<p>Latitude is separate even from that, and requires its own separate opt-in in order to enable it as a service. On top of that opt-in, Google also emails the user periodically to remind them that their location is being shared, explains the general risk around that sharing, and gives the user opportunity to change or disable it.</p>
<p>So no, it&#8217;s very far from &#8220;opted in without recourse&#8221;. Quite the contrary.</p>
<p>Good thing we&#8217;re talking about iOS here, and not Android then.  I thought you almost had a point there for a minute.  Unless you mean opting out of location awareness for Google Maps on iOS in order to avoid Latitude (or general location tracking for more than mapping results), in which case it would render the entire app pretty useless.</p>
<p>Latitude is separately opt-in within Google Maps. It&#8217;s totally separate from the normal location services needed for mapping. I&#8217;m sure it would be separately opt-in on Google Maps for iOS as well.</p>
<p>Forgive me for not taking &#8220;Porter is sure&#8221; as gospel truth.</p>
<p>So&#8230; Google would go to the trouble to put multiple layers of opt-in in place for its Latitude service for Android (and I believe for Blackberry), but you suspect that despite that history, you think they would opt-in users on Apple iOS by default. Is that what you&#8217;re saying?</p>
<p>In the sense that iOS doesn&#8217;t allow for layered access in that manner, yes.  Yes I am.</p>
<p>Right, because it&#8217;s not like Apple is getting into advertising or anything.</p>
<blockquote>"Apple’s users"? They are people that happen to own an Apple-manufactured device. They are not Apple’s users, and Apple should have zero say in what they do on their own devices, or what location information they choose to share. Apple’s control (and influence) over the user’s behavior should end at the point of purchase.</blockquote>
<p>i&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s completely ridiculous to take my words so far out of context. Next time quote me, don&#8217;t give me your thrown up interpretation of what you think i meant kid.</p>
<p>&#8220;that really grinds my gears&#8221;</p>
<p>Your words were, &#8220;can you imagine the nerve of apple not wanting google to keep tabs on the current locations of their users? SUCH NERVE!&#8221;.</p>
<p>You may not have meant it in that way, but the way you phrased it implies that you believe that A) the users are Apple&#8217;s, and B) that Apple has the right to know where those users are, and C) Apple has the right to dictate whether users are allowed to use third-party location-based software platforms.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get your gears in a grind. Be clearer in your statements if you don&#8217;t want to be misunderstood.</p>
<p>See, quoting me isn&#8217;t hard. Also, your logic fails. With my quotes it&#8217;s much easier to see that.</p>
<blockquote>can you imagine the nerve of apple not wanting google to keep tabs on the current locations of their users</blockquote>
<p>I have not said anyone belongs to anyone, i have not said anyone should get any data, i have said google shouldn&#8217;t get apple&#8217;s users data.</p>
<p>YOU IMPLY THE REST.  learn to talk to people in a forum. If you need clarification, ASK FOR IT.</p>
<p>Or go on a tirade and get called out.</p>
<p>My objection is the use of the phrase &#8220;their users&#8221; in reference to users who happen to own Apple-branded devices. It implies ownership and/or control, which are concepts that are central to the debate over Apple&#8217;s strategy with regard to users&#8217; rights over their own device and experience.</p>
<p>Again, I understand what made you upset (sigh). You state that like it&#8217;s fact. It&#8217;s not. My point was please ask for clarification before violently shoving your words in my mouth.</p>
<p>Which can be easily avoided, by quoting, or asking for clarification.</p>
<p> I don&#8217;t think &#8220;Apple&#8217;s users&#8221; is  bad usage at all.</p>
<p>For example: Apple doesn&#8217;t lightly share their user&#8217;s information with third parties.</p>
<p>Apple has users using their products. Apple exerts come control over how users can use Apple products, ergo, they are Apple&#8217;s users. Any Apple user cannot simply set any map app to be the default map app. This is control over how the user can use the product.</p>
<p>Most companies that produce software have some controls and limitations on usage.</p>
<p>The general complaint from my perspective is that Apple exerts control over how users can use Apple products, period. It&#8217;s anti-consumer.</p>
<p>If you think Apple exerts too much control over how people user Apple products, then the solution is simple: don&#8217;t use Apple products.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, the level of Anti-Apple vitriol in your comments leads one to conclude that there is more to it than just that complaint.</p>
<p>latitude is &#8220;opt-in&#8221;.  Please stop spreading FUD or provide links to where it states google maps is keeping tabs on my location without my consent.</p>
<p>Well now they will, by the means of Google Maps app.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not widely known. That is widely speculated.</p>
<p>(which would give them more than just your information, etc)</p>
<p>More? So they would have gotten your finances and first born?</p>
<p>Its actually mostly true.  Google provided all of the data but Apple developed the app using the APIs provided.</p>
<p>The sticking point was Apple wanted the advanced APIs that allow navigation, Google wanted more control.  Apple wouldnt give control (logically so since they were at war) so Google wasn&#8217;t going to give them all of the features.</p>
<p>How is that good? Now it has no native support: you click on the address in email  &#8211; you get it open in Apple maps, you need to copy it and toggle Gmaps. You need to send a pin in the email? The other person gets URL to wen apps not the app in iOS. It was a <strong>dicky</strong> move for sure. Not sure about it being good.</p>
<p>An easy solution: when you click on an address, a list of all mapping apps opens and you choose the one you like. <br />
The only remaining problem, is that you have to get an Android phone for that to work. But it&#8217;s not that hard.</p>
<p>no, they would have done the exact same thing except it would be more highly integrated</p>
<p>google didn&#8217;t refuse the features, they wanted stronger branding and more data and now, with the new app, they have it.</p>
<p>apple, in blocking google, accomplished nothing except tarnishing their brand</p>
<p>And stopping the flood of data to their largest competitor in the mobile space.  You know, little things like that.</p>
<p>im willing to bet at least 50% of iphone 4/5 users will have installed this within 3-4 months.</p>
<p>considering how much more (and higher quality)  data google is able to collect now, that&#8217;s a net gain.</p>
<p>or if you&#8217;re google, comparing it to the iphone 4s, launching with google maps on iOS 5, a 50% net loss of analytics.</p>
<p>Depends on who your apologizing for i guess. :D</p>
<p>By your own sources, the amount of data that Google got from old maps is very low. So if they get to track 50% of all iOS users any way they wish is still a win over very limited data from 100%.</p>
<p>Let alone, Android is providing more data for them on a higher mobility devices(smartphones vs tablets)</p>
<p>Those are some hard numbers you&#8217;re working with there.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a single app that&#8217;s installed on 50% of the iPhone user base.  Facebook maybe?  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see some adoption of Google Maps, but the Apple Maps app is actually a really REALLY nice app.  Just not the backend database.</p>
<p>The backend database is 90% of what matters. It&#8217;s also not something you can throw money at and &#8220;fix&#8221; overnight. It takes years of data refinement and raw human effort. That&#8217;s something Google has been very successful at by crowdsourcing via their MapMaker system, with many thousands of individual citizen mappers making updates and tweaks to the map based on their local knowledge.</p>
<p>Apple will find it very difficult to compete with that, even given years to do so, because they&#8217;re not a company that has (or I believe will ever) embrace the community collaboration model. Google Maps has become excellent on the raw power of community goodwill and many thousands of individual efforts to improve it for the public benefit.</p>
<p>If only apple used large existing mapping databases like openstreet maps and tomtom.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great, but it obviously hasn&#8217;t solved their problem despite massive amounts of money being thrown at it, or people wouldn&#8217;t be so excited about this launch. Most of the comments I&#8217;m seeing from people are basically giving thanks that they&#8217;ve been liberated from a grossly sub-standard experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big deal because of the fubbed launch and because gmaps is the gold standard.</p>
<p>Apple maps has improved 10x which has been noted, but keep commenting on something you don&#8217;t use.</p>
<p>When the competition is 100x better, getting 10x better still makes you 1/10th of the leader.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true, but gmaps are not nearly that.</p>
<p>OH WAIT.</p>
<p>And in return Google can now sell better ads.  Good job all around :D!</p>
<p>Speculating that 50% will have it installed in whatever amount of time is baseless and ridiculous.</p>
<p>I take it you don&#8217;t use and haven&#8217;t tried Apple&#8217;s Maps, but if you did, you&#8217;d know that it&#8217;s pretty good. Yeah, it doesn&#8217;t have as many data as Google maps, but it gets you from A to B, and will show what you&#8217;re looking for 9 times out of 10.</p>
<p> Depending on where you live, and what you use it for, it goes from mediocre in some countries where you really feel the lack of data (if you look for something in Baghdad for example, the data set is pretty poor) to pretty good. (The data sets for Scandinavia and the US are much better).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s fine for a basic mapping app, gets you from A to B, and a big majority of IPhone customers in Europe and the US (the one who like their iphone cause it &#8220;just works&#8221; will be fine with it, and WON&#8217;T INSTALL Google Maps. They&#8217;ll just click the inbuilt Maps App in their phone like they always have. If Google Maps gets installed to even a third of new iPhones, Google will be more than happy and it&#8217;ll be a great success for both companies.</p>
<p>(And feel free to cite an example with an obscure British or Australian town that you read online that Apple Maps can&#8217;t find, it takes away absolutely nothing from the point I&#8217;m making.)</p>
<blockquote>I take it you don’t use and haven’t tried Apple’s Maps, but if you did, you’d know that it’s pretty good.</blockquote>
<p><strong>NOPE</strong><br />
i live in vancouver. i tried it, it&#8217;s a joke.</p>
<p>Dublin, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki&#8230; been there, had to switch to Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>ENOUGH! I have never seen so many &#8220;homers&#8221; in my life! I have an Iphone 4 s and have used both Google and Apple maps. I can say 100% Apple maps is horrible! and doesn&#8217;t even show 1/4 of the places I&#8217;m put in. it is so bad I am eligible for an upgrade and leaning heavily toward a Galaxy phone. So anyone saying apple maps is good at anything is wrong and a lier and is just a sad homer. I live in Miami and can tell  you first hand it could not find multiple locations from there to Orlando. its horrible!  Case closed from an actual &#8220;non homer&#8221; user of both.</p>
<p>Seeing as how Google Maps is the most popular free app in the store in less than 24 hours of being available I think that flood was just delayed a bit.  And now they have LESS control over it, compared to if it was their integrated app.</p>
<blockquote>google didn’t refuse the features,</blockquote>
<p>that&#8217;s completely untrue. They did refuse the features because apple refused latitude.</p>
<blockquote>apple, in blocking google, accomplished nothing except tarnishing their brand</blockquote>
<p>Actually, because of it, apple maps has accelerated at a ridiculous pace, and now apple users have 4 free turn by turn maps to choose from, with all major mapping providers covered.</p>
<p>that doesn&#8217;t include navigon, tomtom etc.</p>
<blockquote>that’s completely untrue.</blockquote>
<p>What he said is semantically and factually correct. Google refused Apple&#8217;s offer, not the features.</p>
<p>Also it wasn&#8217;t latitude. Latitude is not beyond Apple&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>Please cite sources. I&#8217;ve read different.</p>
<p>Of course. Google is always in the wrong, stupid Google for wanting to make people on other platforms happy.</p>
<p>/googlehater</p>
<p>I think the biggest advantage is that they now can update whenever they want. All the built in apps require an OS update to change&#8230;something they should address in iOS 7 so that they can make smaller updates throughout the year (Other than point OS updates.)</p>
<p>I agree, except for this &#8220;robust &amp; beautiful&#8221; iOS experience you are talking about. hasn&#8217;t changed that much at all in years.</p>
<p>Hasn&#8217;t really had a need to.  iOS is an app launcher.  You&#8217;re not meant to spend time on the home screens, like you&#8217;re encouraged to do with Android.  You take your iPhone out, unlock it, open an app, perform your task, and lock it again.</p>
<p>So, if your task is to see your agenda for today (very common task, isn&#8217;t it?), you have to unlock the phone, find the calendar, run it, and then lock again.  Isn&#8217;t it easier just to see it on the main screen (or even lock screen)?</p>
<p>Actually it&#8217;s both bad and good.  Apple wanted to move away from Google. Google was &#8220;making money&#8221; of Apple users through their data use of Maps.  Apple didn&#8217;t like that, which is why they canceled their contract early with Google.</p>
<p>The best thing Apple could have done was put out a decent alternative Maps application that was actually useful and not half-baked.</p>
<p>Because Apple put out a bad product, Google came back in looking like the hero.  Apple looks bad, Google looks good.</p>
<p>-  Google has access to Apple users now.<br />
 - iOS users who moved to Google Maps are less likely to go back to Apple Maps in the future (People are creatures of habit).<br />
 - Google has an SDK available for iOS developers to incorporate Google Maps to the developer apps,.<br />
 - Developers are less likely to change back to Apple Maps since Google Maps is so much better.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a bigger win for Google and the consumer.</p>
<p>+1 (would have used the recommend button, but didn&#8217;t want to ruin the number)</p>
<p>Apple only removed Google map&#8217;s DATA because Google never had a native app before this one.  The old &#8220;Google Maps&#8221; actually was Apple&#8217;s not Google&#8217;s!</p>
<p>haha how does it feel to have your own platform provider make better apps for competing platform?</p>
<p>couple years ago i used to hate on apple and be a typical android fanboy&#8230; i don&#8217;t need to do that anymore google (android) is dominating the market.</p>
<p>my point is that i&#8217;m happy for them they got their gmaps.</p>
<p>Exactly my feelings. To the last word. :-)</p>
<p>I find no reason to not hate on apple when they&#8217;re still trying to pull a Microsoft and sue competitors out of business.</p>
<p>This is the problem. I don&#8217;t care about Apple or iOS. I do care about what they are doing, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;dominating the market&#8221;? Not in usage. And the majority of those phones are cheap 0$ phones that people like my mother buy.</p>
<p>Sounds like sour grapes to me&#8230;</p>
<p>Citation?</p>
<p>lol dominating? You must think Honda is dominating Mercedez too.</p>

<p>No, the blue line that keeps going up is Apple&#8217;s profits and value as a company. Thanks for supporting my claim though.</p>
<p>If by rising you mean plummeting, you would be correct.  Or are we talking about a different AAPL?</p>
<p>Yep&#8230; Dropping 20% in the last 2 months &#8211; riding value in the opposite land.</p>
<p>Um&#8230;they are if you&#8217;re taking sales.</p>
<p>Talking*</p>
<p>There are reasons beyond maps now why I stick to Android.</p>
<p>I prefer Android. The ability to change default apps like browser, keyboard etc&#8230; the fact 3rd party browsers aren&#8217;t forced to used an older layout engine or a gimped Javascript engine.</p>
<p>But now Apple has got rid of a few people I expect Apple to innovate more on the OS front too, if they can make some cool changes to the OS than I&#8217;d happily switch back.</p>
<p>I think Steve Jobs said it best &#8220;like giving someone ice water in hell&#8221;</p>
<p>Why the hate? Only the UI is better on the iOS app, by the looks of things. The actual function is a little worse; on Android you can download offline maps.</p>
<p>Like msl86 said: there are more reasons why I use Android than Maps. Like customisation.</p>
<p>Reportedly, Google makes a lot more money out of iOS than they do out of Android, so I guess they just know on which side their bread is buttered.</p>
<p>I think your quoting old information.</p>
<p>Better according to who?</p>
<p>Google Maps fits the Android design guidelines, and the new iOS app seems to do well to fit the platform it&#8217;s on.</p>
<p>Doesnt really matter.  Doesnt diminsh how awesome the maps app is we have had on Android for a couple of years now (and the improvements are minor on IOS) and ours is still integrated, its the default maps.  So the user experience is still great on Androids for the same reason Apple trumped up their maps.  I can bring up voice search (predates Siri) and say, &#8220;Take me to.&#8221;  Unfortunately Google still doesnt have the ability to integrate  with Siri like that.</p>
<p>How does it feel to know that Google Maps most likely won&#8217;t be coming to WP?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d much rather Android&#8217;s folders and WP&#8217;s giant list scroll&#8230;.oh wait.</p>
<p>That list scroll is the WORST.</p>
<p>In the world of iPhone there are no buttons.</p>
<p>Yes, my folder is full with Calculator, Clock, Calendar, Compass, Game Center, iTunes, Maps, Notes, Passbook, Reminders, Stocks, Weather and if only I could put Newsstand in there as well.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t toss it away just yet, notice the lack of voice commands and integration with hyperlinks. Also notice how deep into the menus you have to go for street views.</p>
<p>It has great data but makes a lousy hands free system which is what you want in the car.</p>
<p>This is the first release.</p>
<p>No doubt 1.1 will have offline maps, an iPad version (for the people who like mounting those things to their dashboards) and Google Voice integration.</p>
<p>Zagat, here I come!</p>
<p>But that is not good enough. Every single release of any map application has to be perfect and raise the bar on all previous map applications or it is a complete failure. I know this because I have read hundreds of post telling me that exact thing since the day Apple released Maps.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Yes, except here Google have released a new maps app which is in every way superior to the existing maps on iOS, it simply lacks a couple of features found on the Android version. On the other hand when Apple maps launched, Apple took an existing fully functional product and replaced it with something vastly inferior. This is what upset people, not that it wasn&#8217;t perfect, but that it was worse than what they had before, and they didn&#8217;t get a choice in having it or not.</p>
<p>It seemed to have primarily upset fandroids though.  Strange phenomenon.  I use Apple Maps for driving directions and it works fine.  I like GMaps for street view though&#8230;</p>
<p>No it primarily made &#8220;fandroids&#8221; laugh. It primarily upset iPhone users, who could no longer rely on their phones to get them where they wanted to go. Hence the vast number of complaints, tublrs, and websites about it. Or do you think that Tim Cook made a public apology to appease Android users?</p>
<p>i liked apple maps about 1000 times more than the old google maps personally, for one reason, turn by turn navigation, google maps for ios used to be truly awful, and this new app is what maps should have been 2 years ago, instead google didnt innovate because it was focused on android (perfectly reasonable) and apple stepped in and made due.</p>
<p>The previous version of Maps on iOS was an Apple built Maps app that used Google services for mapping.  Apple didn&#8217;t have built in Navigation, that wasn&#8217;t Google Maps.  This is the first Google Maps on iOS, give credit where it&#8217;s due.</p>
<p>Right, but they weren&#8217;t allowed to use turn by turn according to their agreement with Google. That&#8217;s why there was no turn by turn and that&#8217;s partly why they made their own maps app.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t give voice turn-by-turn because they wanted that map application has Google logo visible and that latitude comes with the maps as well then.</p>
<p>Apple rejected idea that application would tell user that Maps are from Google and that Apple users would use Google latitude service for location sharing and tracking among friends and family (user list who can see where they are, how long and how accurated data is).</p>
<p>If Apple would allowed Google logo to be shown on splash or in Icon or even somewhere in menu etc and allowed Latitude to come for iOS as well, it would got Voice Turn-By-Turn, vector maps and more data. Apple was responsible for Application for maps in iOS all the time. Google brought only the data and Apple didn&#8217;t want to offer anything else back than some basic data what Google couldn&#8217;t use to improve maps.</p>
<p>your post is intentionally misleading.</p>
<p>His/her post is accurate.  Go look at someone who didnt upgrade.  Its not Google Maps.  Its Maps, and it was developed/updated by Apple.  Google provided the back end.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so as to me it insinuates that apple could have added turn by turn.</p>
<p>interpretation is a bitch though, re-reading it; i may have jumped the gun.</p>
<p>Google Maps is what Apple maps should have been. Apple Maps failed big time and it embarrassed Apple to no end.</p>
<p>Sure there are a couple features that Google left out for now, but even without those features it&#8217;s still 100% better than Apple Maps would ever dream to be,</p>
<p>YES. </p>
<p>Google Voice integration? Does that mean Siri is getting kicked to the curb?</p>
<p>I think he means Google Search, which was just updated to be more &#8220;Google Now&#8221; like in that its a voice search.  You can download it too.  My coworker actually prefers it to Siri (but again its not a home button thing).</p>
<p>of course he did.. ?</p>
<p>a lot of people made it sound as if worse maps are a reason to avoid an iPhone&#8230;</p>
<p>Originally no navigation was, but that had primarily to do with how i used my phone.  For me it was a navigation system.</p>
<p>Just makes it so much better that an ad by Verizon and Motorola highlighting maps as a reason to buy their phone is the main add on the Verge right now.</p>
<p>Looks amazing. Google didn&#8217;t half-step with this. I know a few people who didn&#8217;t update to iOS 6 because they were scared of the maps situation. I don&#8217;t know if this is good for Apple or not, maybe a little embarrassing, but this is good for iPhone users.</p>
<p>It is definitely good for Google. They gather traffic data and get more people into using &#8220;Google+Local&#8221;</p>
<p>And now iOS users get two free premium mapping solutions instead of just one mature but woefully under-featured one.</p>
<p>Yes, now if I could only change default apps on iOS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been seriously considering a switch over to Android because of that very reason. I love iOS, but I would really love the ability to change default apps. Plus I&#8217;m a big fan of Jelly Bean 4.2 and it&#8217;s stark design language/UI.</p>
<p>But&#8230; I&#8217;ll probably just end up sticking with my iPhone. I love its impeccable build quality, incredible camera, seamless iCloud backup, compatibility with my MBA, overall UI fluidity and smoothness, and of course the brilliantly designed apps residing in Apple&#8217;s App Store.</p>
<p>Intents and the &#8220;share&#8221; hooks in Android are extremely powerful tools.</p>
<p>But definitely consider an Android device, especially if you haven&#8217;t seen one in a while. It&#8217;s just as seamless and impeccable as you describe your iPhone to be.</p>
<blockquote> It’s just as seamless and impeccable as you describe your iPhone to be. </blockquote>
<p>Having switched from a Galaxy Nexus to an iPhone 5, no it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s not even close, really.</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus? That&#8217;s a good comparison with a 4S. How about Nexus 4? Or a Note II? Ever tried the Nexus 7 or 10?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if Samsung devices are the best suggestions for &#8220;impeccable&#8221; build quality.</p>
<p>And a glass back LG phone is?</p>
<p>Plastic might feel cheap, but it really isn&#8217;t all that bad a material for a phone. Not that I even notice with my Samsung Galaxy S3, as I have a bamboo case on my phone, and before that I had a metal one or a rubber one.</p>
<p>Materials used != build quality</p>
<p>Jeebus,  Well said!</p>
<p>Honestly I think the S3 trumps the Nexus 4. I was really excited for the new Galaxy S3 Mini but sadly Samsung dumbed down the specs. Lets get a 4.3&quot; 720p Android monster Samsung, come on.</p>
<p>There are several of those already. Why do you need more?</p>
<p>My Nexus 4 running 4.2 is as smooth as my iPad and much smoother than my Nexus S running 4.1 (I guess it&#8217;s underpowered).  I don&#8217;t think &#8216;smoothness&#8217; is really a competitive advantage for iPhones these days.  Apart from brand recognition, I think the iPhone&#8217;s biggest selling point over Android phones is its form factor &#8211; for those who want a smaller phone.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m very curious about Google&#8217;s iOS Maps &#8211; the maps &amp; nav apps on Android have always been excellent so to hear they&#8217;ve been improved on is interesting.  The one thing that bugs me about Navigation is how deep the &#8216;traffic&#8217; layer is. I hope it&#8217;s less of a faff now.</p>
<p>The issue is that Android solves smoothness using raw hardware. Take Nexus S (or Galaxy S) and iPhone 4: It&#8217;s basically the same hardware (Sammy actually got a nicer GPU), but Android 4.1 on Nexus S is way slower than iOS 6 on an iPhone 4.<br />
That&#8217;s the issue with Android. The phone get old pretty fast.</p>
<p>(And I have few upgrade paths. Galaxy S owner and want a 4&quot; high-end phone&#8230; The closest I got is RAZR i &#8211; but without 4.2, no way)</p>
<p>Be honest now, have you really used an iPhone 4 with iOS 6? Apple devices slow down the exact same way every OS release. Just scrolling through lists shows a very noticeable drop in framerate compared to older versions of the OS.</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 4 with iOS 6 and I can vouch for your claim.</p>
<p>Yes, it does slow down, lol. My hardware can&#8217;t take the awesomeness! ajoiajdoijaopwijqwe</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just waiting on the next iPhone to be released (iPhone 5s maybe?), and I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll have USB 3 :P</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath for that if I were you&#8230;</p>
<p>Yep, and my only iOS device is an iPod touch with iOS 6 (half the RAM of iPhone 4).</p>
<p>It lags? Sure. Still better than almost the same hardware (double the RAM and better GPU) on Jelly Bean :(</p>
<p>The Nexus 4 is a Phablet. The Note II is a Phablet. The Nexus 7 and 10 are both tablets.</p>
<p>And none of them run anywhere near as fluid as iOS 6 on the iPhone 5, nor make as much sense for consumer use.</p>
<p>Nexus 4? No LTE. Way too large screen.</p>
<p>Note 2? No stock Android, way way too large screen.</p>
<p>Nexus 7? Dumb aspect ratio, not enough content on the display.</p>
<p>Nexus 10? Dumb aspect ratio, why is this device built for landscape mode?</p>
<blockquote>Nexus 4? No LTE. Way too large screen.</blockquote>
<p>Many don&#8217;t need LTE. The screen size is perfect for mel.</p>
<blockquote>Note 2? No stock Android, way way too large screen.</blockquote>
<p>You can get stock Android on it. It&#8217;s not a phone, but that&#8217;s a good thing. While I personally wouldn&#8217;t want one, the screen size is perfect for some. I have a friend who has one and he loves it.</p>
<blockquote>Nexus 7? Dumb aspect ratio, not enough content on the display.</blockquote>
<p>The aspect ratio is your opinion, 100%. I prefer the aspect ratio. That&#8217;s my opinion. There are enough apps for the Nexus 7 now. I&#8217;ve talked to people with a Nexus 7 and they love it. I&#8217;ve also talked to people who don&#8217;t like it. Moral of the story: it works both ways.</p>
<blockquote>Nexus 10? Dumb aspect ratio, why is this device built for landscape mode?</blockquote>
<p>Again, entirely your opinion. Android is built for 10inch tablets in landscape. I&#8217;d rather have it in landscape than portrait at this size.</p>
<p>Pretty much all of what you say is your opinion. I disagree with every single one. But that&#8217;s my opinion.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t make your opinion seem like fact, because it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p>How many people have you talked to that have an iPad, but don&#8217;t like it?</p>
<p>I have a friend who is an Apple lover, but doesn&#8217;t really like his iPad. He doesn&#8217;t have a use for it.</p>
<p>I know people who have iPad&#8217;s just because they&#8217;re Apple products. They don&#8217;t really use them or appreciate them; when I ask &#8216;why did you buy an iPad?&#8217; they answer &#8216;because it&#8217;s an Apple product, it&#8217;s cool, it&#8217;s awesome&#8217; etc.</p>
<p>Are you suggesting your friends are Apple products.  Is that a compliment or a dis?</p>
<p>I;&#8216;m guessing by that you mean &#8217;Are you suggesting your friends own Apple products. Is that a compliment or a dis?&#8217;.</p>
<p>I know people who own Apple products and people who own Google/Android/OEM products. It&#8217;s neither a compliment or a dis: it&#8217;s a fact. Some people I know have Apple products because they&#8217;re Apple products.</p>
<p>You mean the people that returned them to get an Android tablet? 3. But then again I don&#8217;t know that many people with tablets to begin with.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t they like it? Lack of GPS and software capability. It all depends on what&#8217;s important to you, I guess.</p>
<p>You seriously know three people who returned an <em></em>iPad<em></em> to get an Android <em></em>tablet<em></em>? That is amazing. I&#8217;ve never even heard of someone doing this, let alone known someone who did.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve heard of anyone doing that either, but I guess it&#8217;s possible. Usually people buy a tablet (for either platform) and, whether it suits them or not, try to justify their purchase because they don&#8217;t want the hassle of returning it.</p>
<p>I can say I bought an owned an iPad 2 for about 8 months. Couldn&#8217;t get over the trash that is iOS. Smooth, yes, but it SUCKS terrible in features and flexibility.</p>
<p>For some it may be great, but glad we all have options to suit us.</p>
<p>Thank you, really.</p>
<p>It seems that you are just talking without any basis in reality. Actually, the Nexus 4 screen, including the home button, is just as large as the iPhone 5 screen, including the home button. You will have to move your finger just as far down. Exactly the same length. Except in the Nexus 4, you get advantage of extra space when in full screen. <br />
It&#8217;s also a bit wider, but that&#8217;s not an issue since navigation buttons in Android aren&#8217;t only placed in the top-left hand-side of the screen. You have a back button which is WAY easier to press than navigation buttons in iOS.</p>
<p>Very good point.</p>
<p>A very good point by a nullpointer.</p>
<p>Congratulations you both just made me laugh.</p>
<p>Not really. The iPhone 5 must be, what, 4.5inches including the home button. The Nexus 4 is 4.7.</p>
<p>He was talking about the username&#8230;</p>
<p>My mistake xD. He did say &#8216;a nullpointer&#8217; though, which is slightly ambiguous My fault though :D.</p>
<p>The Note II gets long looks from my iPhone toting coworkers,  and a few of them are on the verge of switching.  So the size and display are definitely enticing to some people.</p>
<p>So yeah,  it&#8217;s a fablet &#8211; your point?</p>
<p>Nexus 4 is a phablet? That&#8217;s news to me.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s dumb about 16&#215;9 and 16&#215;10? Sure as hell beats 4&#215;3.</p>
<p>subjectivity  <br />

<p>I have a Nexus 7 and it lags more than my 4S let alone a 5.</p>
<p>I do too, and I see this all the time. Random stutters, slowdown, launcher locks and has to be force-closed. Happens randomly.</p>
<p>Yeah my launcher often just disappears and I have to open the app list to bring it back.</p>
<p>I was having lag issues, then I realized I only had 3 gbs of space left. After a clean up and wipe/reinstall of stock, it runs just fine again.</p>
<p>3GB is loads&#8230; if it takes 3GB of free space to run not like shit then they have serious issues.</p>
<p>just wondering what launcher you guys were using? (stock?)</p>
<p>Nova launcher here but I was completely stock until a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>Nova.</p>
<p>Nova here too, and it doesn&#8217;t really lag (at least not like pre-ICS devices) but it&#8217;s still nowhere close to an iOS device.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an Asus issue, not Android.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 runs stock Android, no ASUS software at all. So it is most likely an Android/Nexus 7 issue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an nVidia issue, as usual.</p>
<p>This is why I&#8217;m hoping ASUS and Google use Snapdragon S4 Pro in the likely Nexus 7 refresh at I/O &#8217;13.</p>
<p>As long as it&#8217;s not Google. IT&#8217;S NEVER GOOGLE.</p>
<p>Yap, thank the proprietary Tegra driver for this, unfortunately.</p>
<p>Check my comment above yours.</p>
<p>Yeah. I like the Tegra, I just wish nVidia would open up the development of the driver so it could integrate better.</p>
<p>Same here. Lag and smoothness DO count, because many people that I&#8217;ve given my Nexus 7/Android 4.2 to try, think that maybe they&#8217;ve done something wrong, or a tap didn&#8217;t register, etc. I haven&#8217;t personally seen the &#8220;Herky-Jerky Scroll Dance&#8221; this bad since iPh 3 or iPad 1 with iOS 5.</p>
<p>You can witness this for yourself on the comparison videos on YT: Nexus 7 vs. iPad Mini (A5 just like the iPad 2 and iP-4s). Apple sure does much more for the UX, with much less spec-tech available in their devices.</p>
<p>As for Maps: whatever works for ya. Apple Maps works here locally in Germany perfectly&#8230; for ME. No StreetView or transit here anyway, so no advantage for G-Maps.</p>
<p>Yeah I think a lot of the people who say project butter has removed all lag are only comparing it to past versions of Android and haven&#8217;t had any long term use of iOS.</p>
<p>As for maps. It&#8217;s google maps all the way for me.</p>
<p>The difference is iOS gives top processor priority to the UI layer where Android does not. iOS also implements some software tricks to make it smoother. Jelly Bean improved smoothness on Android and it&#8217;s pretty smooth, especially on fast hardware, unless there&#8217;s a background app eating up a bunch of CPU for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Having both iOS and Android devices I would say it&#8217;s a non-issue for both at this point. Good thing there&#8217;s choice in the matter.</p>
<p>Try iPhone4. It lags in many areas.(Own one, not happy. Prefer no lag on Galaxy Nexus)</p>
<p>When it comes to &#8220;less spec-tech&#8221;, you might want to look at the benchmarks that put Apple&#8217;s products as the highest spece&#8217;d mobile devices out there.</p>
<p>I have one too and it doesn&#8217;t lag at all.</p>
<p>Clearly you haven&#8217;t played with a Nexus 4 yet?</p>
<blockquote>Having switched from a Galaxy Nexus to an iPhone 5, no it’s not. It’s not even close, really.</blockquote>
<p>I agree from a software standpoint as well.  I have been a long time iOS user and have an iPhone 5.  I just bought a nexus 7 as my tablet and while the UI language has improved for android it still lags far behind my iphone 5 in speed and smoothness.  Not to mention my nexus 7 crashes about 5 times as often as my iphone does.</p>
<p>So your iPhone 5 crashes?</p>
<p>&#8230;and this troll is back.</p>
<p>Well considering how powerful iPhone5&#8217;s hardware is, it would be a surprise.</p>
<p>Wait, you can&#8217;t change the default apps in iOS? Wow&#8230; I&#8217;m glad I never experencied owning an iOS device. That would drive me absolutely insane. What if you install a different browser? Do all hyperlinks open in the default one? That sounds awful!</p>
<p>That sounds familiar. Like a problem a certain other company had way back in 1995 with forcing people to use their own browser.</p>
<p>You mean you couldn&#8217;t use Netscape on Windows?</p>
<p>Oh wait, you could. And could even make it the default.</p>
<p>There was a time when you couldn&#8217;t make it the default in Windows; when clicking a link in your email application always launched IE and no supported way to change it.</p>
<p>This was when the anti-trust suits started for Microsoft.</p>
<p>There was never a time this was true. The lawsuits were about not being able to choose if IE was installed or not, not which browser was used by default.</p>
<blockquote>You mean you couldn’t use Netscape on Windows?<br />
Oh wait, you could. And could even make it the default.</blockquote>
<p>that awkward moment when he google searches what he just wrote.</p>
<p>I know, right?  I&#8217;ve got Dolphin HD on my iPad &#8211; which is awesome &#8211; but every so often I find my self in Safari &#8211; annoying.  (I also dislike Flipboard&#8217;s browser too).</p>
<p>Eh. On iOS, it&#8217;s kinda Safari or Chrome that are the best, and both allow you to have apps to open in them. But it&#8217;s hit or miss, something iOS definitely needs. They need to also let their Nitro engine run in 3rd party browsers first though.</p>
<p>both need to happen, but if i got my magical xmas list, intents would happen before nitro.</p>
<p>Nitro is fast because it&#8217;s insecure by Appke&#8217;s standards. Only system apps are allowed to modify executable code in memory and have unsigned executable code.</p>
<p>Choosing a different browser doesn&#8217;t do a whole hell of a lot on iOS though. All 3rd party browsers are pretty much required to use Safari&#8217;s rendering and javascript engine. The only thing Chrome does in iOS is add some additional features such as bookmark sync and such.</p>
<p>The exception is Opera, which does all of its rendering on their cloud.</p>
<p>Chrome on Android is nothing great either. Bookmark and tab syncing are a couple of niceties, but no way to specify a default zoom level, no way to view all tabs and a few others. The main one for me is no default zoom level. I don&#8217;t always want large text Google!!</p>
<p>yeah, but it&#8217;s about 3 miles ahead of the stock browser,  in terms of rendering things properly, and javascript menu&#8217;s and whatnot working.</p>
<p>my 2c.</p>

<p>I was a long time iPhone user and switched from the iPhone 4S to a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and regretted it almost instantly. Sure being able to set default apps was a huge bonus but other than that Android disappointed me.. After 2 months I went back to iPhone and have never looked back again.</p>
<p>I agree that the Galaxy Nexus was a disappointment. My Galaxy S2 was much better IMO. Google basically agreed to let Samsung hamstring the device with inferior hardware.</p>
<p>My guess is that this will be in iOS 7. Given the restructuring of the iOS team I feel we will see some actual change for users this time.</p>
<p>Have you ever had deja, deja, deja, deja, deja vu?</p>
<p>maybe in the windows forum:D I think johnny ive replacing forstall in the UI dept pretty much guarantee&#8217;s visual changes.</p>
<p>What does that have to do with iOS 7 bringing defaults and intents?  I for one have been waiting for iOS to bring that since iOS 3. I think that change would dispel the whole &#8220;iOS is stale&#8221; argument.</p>
<p>I do agree iOS is overdue for some visual changes though.</p>
<p>sorry, i dont&#8217; think i had the best context, i was thinking your deja vu was in reference to:</p>
<blockquote>iOS team I feel we will see some actual change for users this time.</blockquote>
<p>which i took as visual. I agree completely about intents (which is defaults)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to get too deep into the mud, but they are two different but similar things.</p>
<p>Defaults is clicking on a picture and it opening in the app of your choice. Like a file association in windows.</p>
<p>Intents is when looking at that picture choosing where you want to push it. Like the share menu in Android.</p>
<p>Here is a forum post that puts it more eloquently:<br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/24/3384450/breaking-the-ecosystem-shackles-the-power-of-defaults-and-intents-in" target="_blank">www.theverge.com/2012/9/24/3384450/breaking-the-ecosystem-shackles-the-power-of-defaults-and-intents-in</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a similiar situation, I love my iPhone but Android is seriously piqueing my interest. The one thing that holds me back is the lack of a guarantee for future updates.</p>
<p>The ability to change default apps is pretty much the only thing I like about Android more than iOS (though I don&#8217;t like Android&#8217;s implementation of it).</p>
<p>&#8220;two free premium mapping solutions&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they get one free premium mapping solution and one free beta program.</p>
<p>Which one is the beta?</p>
<p>The one linked to Siri (beta).</p>
<p>Well two is better than one.</p>
<p>Which platform has one? Windows Phone?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming that was a jab at Apple Maps, but the first time I launched Google Maps on iOS I got a notice that it was a beta program and I should beware of bugs or incomplete data.</p>
<p>Exactly.  Google&#8217;s admittedly beta-form app is still light years ahead of Apple&#8217;s &#8220;finished product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weird, it&#8217;s almost as if one company has been doing maps for way longer than the other!</p>
<p>Yes.. What&#8217;s interesting is.. I wrote a review for the app on the app store but for some reason am unable to submit it&#8230; Anyone else having similar issue?</p>
<p>They will get published after some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;premium&#8221; and &#8220;woefully under-featured&#8221; are contradictory. It&#8217;s not just premium because there is an Apple logo shown somewhere.</p>
<p>No, I think he meant the G-maps on iPhone is premium while, the one on android is not. Must say it looks slicker on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Google maps isn&#8217;t premium on Android   Oh dear lord  before you taking Dieter&#8217;s word  as if he&#8217;s some prophet  here are a few tidbits he left out .    Google maps on iOS is not nearly as featured rich as the Android counterpart</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not iPad-optimized, for one. Layers are limited largely to satellite and traffic data, without extras like bicycling or terrain. You can&#8217;t quickly browse through local attractions without starting a search, or cache maps for offline use. Turn-by-turn navigation doesn&#8217;t provide a night mode, customizable map layers or manually specified rerouting&#8221;</p>
<p>So before taking Dieter&#8217;s word as Gospel you should understand he left out a few key points  when he declared Google maps on the iPhone the GREATEST  on any platform.</p>
<p>it clearly isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Yes it is.</p>
<p>this is now the best map &amp; navigation app on iOS. Apple looks pretty bad.</p>
<p>You do realize that this was done by design of Apple, right? They knew that if they kept giving Google a free ride on iOS, we would be stuck with crappy Maps app without turn by turn navigation and other necessary features being enjoyed by Android users.  Now we have the best of both worlds, an awesome Google maps app, and an Apple maps alternative.  The best part is that both apps will keep pushing each other forward.  This is great for consumers.</p>
<p>Apple built those maps using Google&#8217;s data. You can thank Apple for making it so crappy.</p>
<p>That old crappy Google Maps app was made crappy by apple unwillingness to share their user data. Now, since google (or rather apple) has effortlessly proven that making a map app isn&#8217;t as easy as it sound,  Apple gave up and give google what they want, your data.</p>
<p>Apple hasn&#8217;t really given Google anything.  Users voluntarily use Google maps, it&#8217;s not mandatory.</p>
<p>And why, exactly, should Apple share its users data with Google?</p>
<p>Apple is not in the business of enabling Google&#8217;s efforts to monetize your personal data.</p>
<p>Except that maps API on iOS results in crappy maps in third party apps.</p>
<p>This is great for Apple.</p>
<p>Hell, if they didn&#8217;t ditched Google Maps and did their own silly attempt in the first place iPhone users would never have had turn-by-turn or vector based maps or this freaking great app.</p>
<p>yes.. iOS now pretty good option in the maps apps, Apple maps, Nokia Here and now this&#8230; Also Here has the option of downloading and saving a part of the map area, I hope Google adds that feature to the app.</p>
<p>yes.. iOS now pretty good option in the maps apps, Apple maps, Nokia Here and now this&#8230; Also Here has the option of downloading and saving a part of the map area, I hope Google adds that feature to the app.Apple might be a little embarrassed but the biggest losers as per me would be the companies that make the paid navigation maps!</p>
<p>This is brilliant especially voice navigation. Apple maps I think is pretty much going to be not used much.</p>
<p>For the first time ever I used Siri in my car to get turn by turn directions (which are apparently now available in Australia, I thought that feature was still missing) to my destination. I was a little wary of the accuracy of the directions, but it worked surprisingly well. I&#8217;m sure Google maps will be my go-to app for manual navigation, but for handsfree use in the car, Siri is hard to beat. If only it integrated better into third party apps. Apple seriously needs to rethink all of the special privileges it gives its own default apps but blocks from third parties.</p>
<p>I agree. I&#8217;ve spent about 30 minutes trying out Google maps, and I actually can&#8217;t see switching from the standard maps app. The ability to just say, &#8220;Take me to Blah&#8221; and have instant voice turn by turn is vastly superior to trying to input the search.</p>
<p>Additionally, from what I&#8217;ve seen so far, it&#8217;s slower with browsing than the default map. The only thing that Google maps has (for my area &#8211; San Diego) that I like better than the default app is street view. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s 3 taps down now, whereas in the previous version, it was only two deep.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes Google maps so good on android. You can do all the voice stuff you mentioned and also have it bring up routes in Google now for places that you recently did searches for or looked up maps. Through the URL linking that Google is attempting to implement in iOS is the Google service integration of android. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see the next version of their iOS search app allow you to do the voice search and it pulls up Google maps.</p>
<p>With Google now, it will give you directions to places you go regularly (work, home, school) and to appointments in calendar before you even ask for them.</p>
<blockquote>With Google now, it will give you directions to places you go regularly (work, home, school)&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, that sounds like the most useless feature ever. You&#8217;re not really selling it to me :)</p>
<p>Directions are sort of pointless, yes. The real boon of Google now in this regard is the realtime traffic card for your commonly used places.</p>
<p>As a use case, I get up in the morning, check the traffic and see that the highway I travel to work is backed up more than usual. I skip my usual second cup of coffee and get to work on time. Though I could check traffic manually, it is certainly faster to have my phone tell me information I want rather than having to ask it.</p>
<p>Also, I discovered today, it throws a notification into the notification shade if traffic is unusually bad for some reason.</p>
<p>Cool feature.</p>
<p>Yep, love Siri and Apple Maps. And I guess I don&#8217;t get the hate for it either. I&#8217;ve used turn by turn on Apple Maps maybe 20 times and it&#8217;s worked flawlessly for me.</p>
<p>yeah, this has saved my ass multiple times, although in specific situations, where i&#8217;m not using a GPS (cause i know the basic route) then take a total wrong turn, that feature has allowed me to quickly figure out where i am and where to go while keeping all my attention on the road.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll still use it for getting back to my house from places I don&#8217;t know and getting to places with an address. GMaps will essentially work as a search engine for finding restaurants/places when I don&#8217;t know where I am specifically going.</p>

<p>Find me one GPS/mapping software that doesn&#8217;t have stories like this and I&#8217;ll give you all the mudkipz</p>
<p>Nokia Maps/Drive.</p>
<p>Because so little people use it.</p>
<p>source?</p>
<p>Really, you&#8217;re going to claim that&#8217;s perfect?</p>
<p>Perfect, no, but depending on the OS you&#8217;re using, its pretty damn good.</p>
<p>Then why was the Apple maps one such big news?</p>
<p>because it&#8217;s apple.</p>
<p>You are not wrong.  In the past when I read these &#8216;my sat-nav made me drive into a river&#8217; stories, I am always al little annoyed they don&#8217;t report the brand of sat-nav being used, but it is a fairly safe bet most were using either TomTom Tele Atlas, or Nokia/Garmin Navteq until a couple of years ago.  All maps have issues.</p>
<p>An urban road that&#8217;s not very wide vs a marker misplaced 70km away from the actual town and instead in the wilderness ( in the case of Apple maps.)</p>
<p>The Google maps issue is no way as severe. Sure, no mapping system is perfect, but Apple maps, at least outside the US, is by far the worst.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to reason with the Google haters. They think they&#8217;ve found a legitimate issue with Google Maps (even though we both know it isn&#8217;t) and they&#8217;re going to latch onto it for as long as possible.</p>
<p>That goes for all haters.</p>
<p>But the Google haters are out in full force today.</p>
<p>There is a woefully small number of people that dislike Google in the world.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;re all concentrated on The Verge&#8217;s comment system today.</p>
<p>Question, where exactly are all those &#8220;Google haters&#8221;? I see nothing but praise here towards Google.</p>
<p>Only this single link here and people start crying how much other people are hating their beloved company. I wonder who is the bigger fanboy here&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those awkward situations where everyone know&#8217;s he&#8217;s the same basic thing he claims to hate, but no one wants to bother engaging him. And having to take the higher road while he freaks out for 5 posts.</p>
<p>Anyone who 1. thinks there are an inordinate number of Google haters on the Verge and 2. takes the time to make 5 posts complaining about it has almost certainly lost perspective.</p>
<blockquote>woefully</blockquote>
<p>Oh! Are you sad that Google haters are less in number?</p>
<p>Oh, how I hate people who hate.</p>
<p>Just as I hate ALL people who generalize.</p>
<p>Same as the people that say Apple Maps is one big disaster.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t heard any complaints from anyone that has been using an iPhone, myself included.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s only the same if they agree with his viewpoint, duh.</p>
<p>In it&#8217;s current state, Google has no such severe mistakes.  But, if you used Google Maps back when it was new and in beta (as I did), there were much bigger issues.  My entire hometown of Woodbridge, Va had NO STREETS AT ALL in the original Google Maps.  I am happy to have a choice on my iPhone of Apple Maps (better integration and decent TomTom data), Navigon (for offline directions), Waze (for the best traffic info), and now Google (Street View, best data). There is no real winner to me.  They all have pros and cons.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s traffic data will improve greatly thanks to a decent iOS app.</p>
<p>The iOS app isn&#8217;t the best navagation app on iOS to be honest it doesn&#8217;t come in 2nd a solid 3rd though.</p>
<p>No voice commands and lack of integration make me stay with Apple maps, also having to do into 2-3 menus to get something done quick I think Navigon is a cool 2nd best in my book.</p>
<p>Your icon is the Apple logo. Pardon me for ignoring your comment about how Apple Maps is better than Google Maps.</p>
<p>read his post, and facepalm.</p>
<p>my god.</p>
<p>Thing is, back when it started, Maps was just in the browser. Google started at the right time, and are reaping in the rewards.</p>
<p>No sat nav mapping solution is perfect.</p>
<p>After actually <em>reading</em> the story, it is clear that Google Maps directions in this situation were <em>perfectly fine</em>. The issue here is that everybody is being directed through the same road, giving the road more traffic than had been anticipated for such a road. Hardly Google Map&#8217;s fault. And certainly <strong>not</strong> an example of wrong directions!</p>
<p>You might want to download Tom Tom, cause you might end up with no reception and therefore no maps depending on which way you are travelling.</p>
<p>tomtom is great.</p>
<p>i feel for android users who live in bad coverage area&#8217;s. If you leave your cache, you only have co pilot, which is awful.</p>
<p>Wow the reviews really suck. Google Maps plus Yelp integration for reviews would be perfect.</p>
<p>It is called &#8220;Google+Local&#8221;. Combining former Google Places and Zagat.</p>
<p>Google Places hasn&#8217;t turned out to be all it promised to be&#8230;</p>
<p>Apple Maps use Yelp.<br />
Not sure about Nokia/Bing/Here Maps</p>
<p>On WP, it uses a combination of sites.  TripAdviser being the most frequent to my eyes when you launch Nokia Maps.</p>
<p>It works pretty well where I live, there are reviews for everything&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not very good at all.</p>
<p>Yelp is useless outside US or even outside the big cities in US</p>
<p>Agreed, now if only it would request local access to my contacts so that I can enter in a persons name and it populates their addy.</p>
<p>That was exactly my thought.  I had to go to Contacts and copy/paste an address.  That sucked.  But yeah, that&#8217;s my only complaint.</p>
<p>They should be able to add this functionality in the next update.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that the case.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not going to happen, Apple will not allow deep integration on 3rd party apps. That combined with lack of voice commands is my main reason to stick with Apple maps, they&#8217;ve come a long way since release day. A year or two from now they&#8217;ll blow Google maps out of he water on iOS, they have the core foundation and deep intergration which Google Maps will never have on iOS.</p>
<p>In iOS 6, apps can request access to Contacts (among other things like Photos, Calendar and Bluetooth) and the user can &#8220;Allow/Deny&#8221; it.</p>
<p>The new Gmail app can access your Contacts to get e-mail addresses. There&#8217;s no reason Google wouldn&#8217;t be able add this to their Maps app.</p>
<p>Google maps won&#8217;t and can&#8217;t access address information outside of a contact such as on a webpage (where it might be most used by the way) or in an e-mail unless it&#8217;s contact related.</p>
<p>Google maps doesn&#8217;t do voice commands nor can it as it competes directly against Siri (see ToS for more details).</p>
<p>Google Maps even made it hard to get into street view where your driving 3 taps? Seriously? (totally fixable though) just poor implementation. You look at a gps app there&#8217;s a high chance that you might be driving why make it so you have to take your eyes off the road to do anything useful?</p>
<p>In short while I like this app because I can get decent data while stationary I&#8217;ll still use Apple maps on the go it&#8217;s just so simple to hold the home button and say Siri take me &#8220;here&#8221; and boom your off.</p>
<p>If only iOS users were given the option to choose which map app should handle a map request from other apps. Android does.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s really funny, because you&#8217;re essentially whining about the fact that Apple won&#8217;t let any 3rd party integrate with the OS, then blaming Google for it. You should really be angry about the fact that Apple won&#8217;t let you use the better maps app with Siri.</p>
<p>Yes, the Apple Maps will beat the 2012 version of Gmaps on 2015.</p>
<p>I like how Google shows you how long it takes to download an app on iOS. Well played, Google, well played.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because we get full apps on iOS. None of that downloading a small file, then opening that app and having it download what it needs.</p>
<p>Hope you were not trying to find the Denver Airport when you left:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kigiphoto/8269178965/in/photostream" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/kigiphoto/8269178965/in/photostream</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed for years that Google Maps has a problem with vague-ish search terms it shouldn&#8217;t. Airports are one of them.</p>
<p>Another that Google always struggles with is when trying to find a business that may also be a city name somewhere else. Inevitably when searching for Napa Auto Parts, just putting &#8216;napa&#8217; will pin me to Napa, CA. You&#8217;d think their heuristics would be programmed to suggest proximity first.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft will sue soon. With every month Google is adopting Metro UI design with every update of their software. before you know it, it will look like Windows 8.</p>
<p>Guessing there was an NDA for this? Anways this looks good, dare I say, better then the android version!?</p>
<p>In the video, Dieter says it performs better than on a Galaxy S III or Nexus 4.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t imagine how Google Maps could perform better on my Nexus 4. It&#8217;s speedy all around.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about the feeling. And you know the feeling on iOS is ALWAYS better no matter which version you&#8217;re on.</p>
<p>I tend to disagree. :-)</p>
<p>Seems like you are the only one.</p>
<p>Sorry, but in terms of snappiness  iOS has always been king. even with project butter on Android.</p>
<p>Looks so much better on my S3 though&#8230; plus my friends complain that the iPhone5 battery is horrendous compared to their old 4s&#8217;.</p>
<p>Than your friends contradict the various reviews and benchmark tests that confirming that the iPhone 5 has slightly better battery life.</p>
<p>Also, how does maps look better on the S3 when the iPhone is using the exact same data, on a brighter display with  higher PPI and better color accuracy?</p>
<p>But yeah, I get it. You just really don&#8217;t want it to be better on the iPhone&#8230;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re old enough to remember, perhaps it&#8217;s the way watching TV and movies on 27&quot; TVs was better than the more common 19&quot; screens. Though in the case of the S3 vs 4S, the 1280&#215;720 resolution helps even more compared to 960&#215;640.</p>
<p>iOS users don&#8217;t rely on mirroring to display movies etc. on TVs, so that doesn&#8217;t apply 1%.</p>
<p>I believe he is referring to an HD screen compared to an iphone users non-hd screen.  Has nothing to do with output to a tv.</p>
<p>i think you&#8217;re correct, (and MY comment doesn&#8217;t apply 1% haha) my apologies @Hallon!</p>
<p>I own a 4 and a 5. The 4 has better battery life than the 5, hands down.  Take a look at Apple&#8217;s comparison: <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone/compare" target="_blank">http://store.apple.com/au/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone/compare</a></p>
<p>The 4S has worse battery life than the 4 in every way and the 5&#8217;s cellular performance finally edges the 4 out. However, neither of the newer models can stand up to the standby life of the 4.</p>
<p>the sky is also blue.</p>
<p>I upgraded from a 4S to a 5 and the battery life on the 5 is at minimum equivalent if not better than the 4S.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned a 3GS, 4S, and now a 5, and the only time I had terrible battery life was on the 4S running 5.0. But when 5.1 was released, it got much better. On the iPhone 5, I&#8217;m consistently getting 2 full days of usage, even better than the 4S.</p>
<p>Also, I can&#8217;t wait until Google updates the Android version of maps with this interface. It&#8217;s definitely coming :-)</p>
<p>I hope it&#8217;s not coming.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s unfortunately right (at least in my opinion). I have a nexus 4, iPhone 5, and a GS3 here and I have to say it looks and feels better on the iPhone 5. Google went all out on this one I&#8217;m really surprised.</p>
<p>is the iOS version different (looks &amp; function) ? im thinking google gave iOS special treatment by building the software from scratch. who knows, google might upgrade android google maps in the near future so it looks and feels similar to the ios one.</p>
<p>because it isn&#8217;t  here are few points Dieter conviently left  out</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not iPad-optimized, for one. Layers are limited largely to satellite and traffic data, without extras like bicycling or terrain. You can&#8217;t quickly browse through local attractions without starting a search, or cache maps for offline use. Turn-by-turn navigation doesn&#8217;t provide a night mode, customizable map layers or manually specified rerouting</p>
<p>The android version is till mroe featured rich.   Don&#8217;t know why he felt the need to get all iPhone dreamy eyed.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using an iPhone 5. There&#8217;s no guarantee his comments will hold true with older iPhones, especially the iPhone 4 &amp; 3GS.</p>
<p>Yup. I tested it on my girlfriend&#8217;s 3GS. It lags. A lot.</p>
<p>Google Maps is definitely slow on my iPhone 4 (iOS 6). Things like zooming and rotating maps are very choppy, and are much more fluid with Apple Maps.</p>
<p><strong>This whole Apple Maps thing was completely overblown, and Nokia/Here/Bing maps is not really better (tested in Austria), but here is an image some people might consider fitting:</strong><br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/xobKH"><img title="Hosted by imgur.com" src="http://i.imgur.com/xobKH.jpg?1" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Apple Maps totally depends on which country you&#8217;re at.<br />
Same for all other maps.</p>
<p>But having the lack of data in their own country US will give it a really bad rep.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where in the US you live but Apple maps is flawless here in NYC.</p>

<p>I really miss the dedicated Send/End call hardware buttons.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure theres a widget for that :-)</p>
<p>Yes I have to say apple dropping google maps was the best thing that could happen (I didn&#8217;t feel that way until today although I&#8217;ve been completely happy with ios maps and haven&#8217;t had any issues. I think most would as well if they would just turn off 3D) as now we ios maps and (IMHO) the best mobile Google maps experience on any smartphone platform (yes I have my nexus 4 and gs3 here as well so I&#8217;m not basing my opinion on a fanboy rant).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure anything Google made is better on Android. I&#8217;m actually surprised Google made it this well, since considering the low expectations Apple maps and Nokia maps made in iOS 6.</p>
<p>Apparently not&#8230;the review is pretty clear that it&#8217;s better on iPhone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I can&#8217;t imagine Google going through all the trouble to make a new Maps app for iOS and intentionally making the experience worse than Android.</p>
<p>I would guess that their priority has been to get this out, and now they will update the Android version.</p>
<p>Most likely a Maps update for Android is coming, if you notice Google is streamlining the look of their apps across the board.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right on the money.  For example, their Currents update today is fantastic and has made me completely reconsider using the app.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we see a Gmail and Maps update in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Yeah Google sure loves that side swipe menu</p>
<p>Considering the new YouTube update, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they bring back that vertical menu they had briefly back into their search site.  That way they have this standard hidden left sided swipe menu across all their products.</p>
<p>Or you can bring it up via the tiny tab represented by three dots on the lower-right side of the screen. I much prefer this as it&#8217;s a one-handed operation. It&#8217;s just difficult at times to hit it.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m sure thats coming for Gmail.</p>
<p>Exactly. I look at the map and I saw the resemblance of Google Now right on the spot. Google has started to mature into a  design-centric company. Look at how Android platform has evolved since the introduction of Holo. Even the new Yahoo Mail app (I know nobody uses it) has the iOS version that looks like a port from Android (i.e. the holo-style theme).</p>
<p>I think Android 5.0 will start implementing some of the design elements seen in Google Now.</p>
<p>Sure hope so. Every day Android gets cleaner, simpler to use, and better to look at all around.</p>
<p>a blogger said &#8220;google is getting better at design much faster than apple is getting better at web services&#8221;. I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t intentionally make the Android version worse. The iOS version is just newer, so it has improvements. The article stated that Google would update the Android version too.</p>
<p>So Dieter is right?  It is cleaner yes..but better that will depend on the user</p>
<p>The thing is the app adornments are cleaner, but not the main thing the user looks at &#8211; the data.  Google maps have a lot of clutter compared to Apple maps.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t have an iPhone so I guess I can&#8217;t really compare with my G. Nexus. And Google map is not on my iPad either. But the iOS Google Map doesn&#8217;t provide the offline caching, which is a huge deal, at least to me.</p>
<p>It does cache maps offline, you just can&#8217;t select a portion to manually download, which I&#8217;m pretty sure you couldn&#8217;t before anyway?</p>
<p>I think people are making a big deal about it because offline maps is available in the Android version.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, Google&#8217;s Android apps aren&#8217;t anything to write home about &#8211; they&#8217;re all very plain and boring.</p>
<p>Different tastes and all, but I think Currents and the 4.2 clock look amazing.</p>
<p>I mean the Google apps, not the stock Android ones. Examples are Gmail (a bad shade of flat grey on flat grey on frikin grey) and Calendar (same as gmail).</p>
<p>The new currents app is definitely very nice though. Kudos to that.</p>
<p>Currents is a Google app. So is G+. So is Youtube.</p>
<p>They all look amazing, and is no where near &#8220;plain and boring&#8221; like you described.</p>
<p>Oh, ok.</p>
<p>someone else who likes the 4.2 clock who is +14? Yay!</p>
<p>I think almost all of the 4.0+ stock apps look much better than their iPhone counterparts.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not clear. It&#8217;s just one persons opinion.</p>
<p>True.  Google could have let Apple and its users rot&#8230;but the truth is Apple Maps would have gotten better in time.  Ultimately, Google wanted the user data.  Releasing it now was smart because everyone is currently wanting an Apple Maps alternative.  A bunch of iPhone users are now probably going to stick with Google Maps which means Apple Maps may have a harder time keeping up (without the user data).</p>
<p>Not everyone.  If you look at comments on maps in most places lots of people are happy with Apple maps, and Apple&#8217;s mapping software is still much better for directions on iOS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure some people will use Google&#8217;s app, but it&#8217;s so easy to just pull up Apple&#8217;s that Apple will have more than enough users to get much better very quickly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not waiting on an Apple&#8217;s maps alternative. What are you talking about?</p>
<p>This just further proves that Google doesn&#8217;t really care about the success of Android alone- all it cares about is getting its services into the hands of as many people as possible.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t prove that.  It proves that Google cares about bringing high quality services to as many platforms as possible.  Because in the end the more people use their stuff the more money they make.</p>
<p>it proves nothing more than Google can&#8217;t afford to lose billions of searches on a platform such as iOS, it&#8217;s still a poorly implementation of a maps app.</p>
<p>Voice commands? Three taps to get into street view, copy/paste to get any address in there? Yuk!</p>
<p>Poorly implementation of a maps app? It still by far much better than Apple&#8217;s offering. No voice commands and having to copy and paste addresses are issues caused by Apple not having an API for Siri and the lack of the ability to change the default application for things. And Google has made it so that developers of other maps can create address hyperlinks that WOULD open Google maps if tapped on. This is a workaround to Apple&#8217;s stupid lack of APIs in iOS.</p>
<p>And IMO. BIG IMO. voice commands if you aren&#8217;t driving is extremely gimmicky and douche looking.</p>
<p>It is not better than Apple&#8217;s offering.  Google could have supported voice commands &#8211; they do already in the Google Search app for iOS.  Also addresses are NOT a SIRI, issue, there&#8217;s a standard contact API that Google could have used to get access to contacts &#8211; that is a MAOR flaw that makes the app unusable for many people.</p>
<p>&quot; voice commands if you aren’t driving is extremely gimmicky&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah right that&#8217;s why Google includes them on Android.  What if you are trying to find your way to a place on foot?  Voice works great in that case, I can just hold my phone up to my head and ask where to go to get to a business.</p>
<p>You both are saying the same exact thing. Android exists to get their services in the hands of as many users as possible. Android by itself isn&#8217;t that profitable for Google at all.</p>
<p>How is that not exactly what I just said?</p>
<p>Yours wasn&#8217;t rah rah Android enough.</p>
<p>Say what? That doesn&#8217;t even make sense.</p>
<p>If you think that Google isn&#8217;t going to continue improving the Maps app for Android, you&#8217;re sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>Yeah I predict a major overhaul coming soon.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what he&#8217;s saying. Read it again.</p>
<p>I love that you try to construe that in a negative way- the company that can look beyond its own platform and has an inclusive view of who should be able to use their services is the one you&#8217;re going to dislike.</p>
<p>Amazing how much reading comprehension fail is in this thread.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to construe anything in a negative way &#8211; people (including me at some points) have been saying for a while that Google is putting crappy apps on iOS to get people to move to Android. This proves that Google&#8217;s focus is on their services and not really Android itself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how often I get attacked for being an Apple, Google, AND Microsoft hater because I don&#8217;t conform to one of the party lines.</p>
<blockquote> This proves that Google’s focus is on their services and not really Android itself.</blockquote>
<p>no it doesn&#8217;t. Apple has employed the &#8220;trojan horse&#8221; technique of getting you to buy one shiny apple product, and then wowing you with it&#8217;s interoperability with other shiny apple products.</p>
<p>Google could be doing the same thing with maps. Show them how good it is, so that they want to come through. Apple does the same thing with garageband, imessage etc.</p>
<p>however, as someone else who is truly cross platform, i feel for you on your last sentence. If you try to be fair, extremists on all sides will come out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good point, and definitely a better approach than delivering worse versions of an app on iOS to try and force people over.</p>
<p>Way to twist things to make Google look bad. Nice try.</p>
<p>Look at the G+ app. It was better when first released on iOS compared to the Android one, but now its the other way round after couple of updates.</p>
<p>If anything this means that Google will focus on making Maps app on Android look beautiful.</p>
<p>Google cares about acquiring the accumulated data of all its users, so it can drive ad revenue.</p>
<p>They are an advertising and data munging company masquerading as a tech company.</p>
<p>As has been said before and said often, if what you&#8217;re getting is &#8220;free,&#8221; you&#8217;re the product, not the customer.</p>
<p>For what the first 2 weeks please, Google Maps was useless for a good 8 months after release. In 2 years the Google Maps app will be that secondary app you might use for street view but lack of voice commands and any deep integration what so ever will kill this app.</p>
<p>Ever heard of an update?? You know..update the app and bring in new features and stuff. Crazy thought, I know!</p>
<p>The new Google+ app was released on iOS before it was released on Android. But as for the Maps, Google knew it had to release a beautiful app if it wanted to win people back (prove that Apple messed up)</p>
<p>Offhand, I&#8217;d say it looks more aesthetically pleasing than the version on my Galaxy Nexus. Having navigation baked in is a welcome feature too. Never understood why there&#8217;s a separate navigation icon on Android. It&#8217;s very clunky.</p>
<p>I kind of get it, as I use the separate Navigation app which starts as soon as I put my phone in its car dock&#8230;all accomplished through a NFC Tag.  It is much easier to start Navigation directly from there as your recent locations is more easily accesible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same app, actually, with 2 different icons/interfaces. You can begin navigation from within Maps, you don&#8217;t have to go find the Navigation icon to do it.</p>
<p>It certainly feels like 2 different apps, though. The Navigation interface hasn&#8217;t been updated since Gingerbread and sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>I actually despise this about Android, I don&#8217;t need several icons per app yet I&#8217;ve used so many that do this,</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way he could&#8217;ve taken that picture at the top right now, since it was light outside when it was taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the brief demo we saw earlier this week is any indication&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I know, right? Just imagine if it wasn&#8217;t daytime at the same time everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear that they had this in advance. Which is funny because they published the AllThingsD report that said Maps would be released tonight knowing full well that it was absolutely true. Makes me wonder about other &#8220;rumor&#8221; reporting in the tech industry.</p>
<p>For now. No doubt they&#8217;re cooking up an Android update as we speak.</p>
<p>Finally! awesome Google! Thanx!</p>
<p>Finally&#8230;</p>
<p>Woohoo!</p>
<p>And all is well.</p>
<p>Try (on your iPhone) going to any other Google app, then to &#8220;related&#8221; then to &#8220;more by google&#8221; then to &#8220;see all&#8221;  then download google maps, then enjoy :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m getting the same there here.  Will keep trying until it downloads.</p>
<p>I know this is weird, but using this link it worked. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8</a></p>
<p>the link itself works. email/text it to yourself.</p>

<p>Thank you Google, thank you!  I&#8217;ve held off updating until the map fiasco was over, finally over :-)</p>
<p>I has just updated my iphone4 to iOS6 today as well!</p>
<p>After you update try Apple&#8217;s Maps, and you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s actually better than the Google offering.</p>
<p>All I got was &#8216;the item you tried to buy is no longer available&#8217;</p>
<p>Not seeing it in Canada App Store&#8230;. :(</p>
<p>Still not coming up via search on my iPhone but I found a direct link!</p>
<p>Google Maps is even more epic than before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>WOW!!! Amazing!!!!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also getting the &#8220;no longer available&#8221; warning&#8230;server problem? Rollout issue? Apple fuckery? Any ideas?</p>
<p>Steve Jobs&#8217; soul has been integrated into iOS5. It&#8217;s probably just him reaching from beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Go to any Google developed app, scroll down and tap &#8220;Developer Info,&#8221; and Maps will be in the list. Just downloaded it now (9:02 PM PST)</p>
<p>Getting its no longer available. This sucks.</p>
<p>Go to any Google developed app, scroll down and tap "Developer Info," and Maps will be in the list. Just downloaded it now (9:02 PM PST)</p>
<p>Not seeing it on the UK store at all yet.</p>
<p>assuming the android update is around the corner</p>
<p>Really hope so. I would like a new UI on android 4.0+</p>
<p>Yep.  Strangely this whole phenomenon of bloggers screaming that Google apps &#8220;Are better on the Apple!&#8221; reminds of another time this happened &#8230; oh yes, the Google + app update.  Now the Android app is better and smoother than the iOS version (not by much, and that shows that Google does good work).</p>
<p>All in all, I think this article could have taken a lesson from that debacle and maybe simmered down the evangelistic tone.</p>
<p>Yep, and all 5 people who use Google + agree with you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s so funny. -me, a year ago.</p>
<p>Ironically a year ago was the last update anyone posted to Google +.</p>
<p>Now people can update to iOS6.</p>
<p>No. Lots of people are waiting for untethered jailbreak :P</p>
<p>Not as many as you&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>The favored son has returned.</p>
<p>The Verge writers must be rejoicing. Now they have one less point to concede to Android.</p>
<p>Not really. The problem is that Google Maps will always play second fiddle to any official Apple app because of integration with the rest of the OS. Tapping on an address in Contacts will open Apple Maps. Asking Siri for directions will open Apple Maps. And until iOS allows you to change default apps like Android, Windows 8, and Mac OS X can, other platforms will still be superior in that regard.</p>
<p>I agree.  Setting default apps &amp; having app-to-app communication is something iOS really should have to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Nonsense. Apple knows what&#8217;s best for you. That&#8217;s the whole point of iOS. Android, on the other hand, assumes that you, the user, know what app is best to use in a given situation.</p>
<p>Well if you put it like that, you make no sense at all unless you think all iOS users are idiots.</p>
<p>Actually, it makes perfect sense since it holds true for the majority.</p>
<p>no more than it does for any other OS</p>
<p>You said it yourself, and you couldn&#8217;t have said it better.</p>
<blockquote>That’s the whole point of iOS. Android, on the other hand, assumes that you, the user, know what app is best to use in a given situation.</blockquote>
<p>This is why I can never fully commit to either iOS or Android. One dictates how I use my phone, the other assumes I should do everything myself. And personally, I find the inability to customize iOS just as maddening as the need to customize Android just to have a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Ideally, there would be a compromise, a platform that offered the consistency, simplicity and polish of iOS with the ability to customize my experience without succumbing to the anything goes, hobbyist approach of Android.</p>
<p>But still, that&#8217;s a minor ding compared to not having the maps at all.</p>
<p>Conveniently Apple Maps can call out to Google Maps. This works great since I have no desire to build a new collection of Google Places and favorites when I already have those in my Address Book.</p>
<p>So I can ask Siri &#8220;take me to Bob&#8217;s&#8221; et al, and then when Maps comes up I hit the route button and select Google Maps. Not perfect but essentially I can tell the iPhone to use the right data set as I please.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly close to a &#8220;just send routes to this app by default&#8221; ideal solution.</p>
<p>And google should be able to update the app and ask access to your contacts in your address book.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Apple probably isn&#8217;t too worried about Google becoming the dominant maps program on iOS again. They will continue to work on their maps until they are as good as Google&#8217;s, and then <em>conveniently</em> wait until after that point if they are ever going to allow default app changes.</p>
<p>I do think there are few writers here that tries to be unbiased, but unfortunately, not all of them.</p>
<p>There are more that are bias than are not, that&#8217;s for sure. Most tech news sites have a pro-Apple slant to them, probably cause most journalists are bias towards Apple.</p>
<p>This is getting old.  I see an Android bias these days anyhow.   It is time for Fandroids to stop feeling sorry for themselves. android runs things now ..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an engineering student and one day I got lost in the liberal artsy part of campus &#8230; there were macs everywhere, like seriously 70+% of all laptops were macs.  It felt alien and weird.</p>
<p>So saying that journalists might have a little Apple brand loyalty is totally acceptable.  Also, people in general seem to have an Apple slant. I&#8217;m saying that because I just read that people are willing to pay a steep price for a fictional Apple TV, it&#8217;s like how people were somehow comparing the yet nonexistent iPad mini to the Nexus 7 &#8230; it was weird &#8230; the internet is weird.</p>
<p>You weren&#8217;t expecting there would be Chrome OS laptops everywhere were you? Cause that would be weird, and yet&#8230;. it is the internet</p>
<p>Nah, I got a Samsung Chromebook and it works for my daily romps.  However, I have a laptop for work stuff  &#8230; <strong>Sings praise to Thinkpad</strong> &#8230; and I would expect a wider range of devices.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that many people don&#8217;t make matrices and flowcharts when they buy a computer &#8230; now that would be certified crazy</p>
<p>Apple make products that people love, it&#8217;s not that weird is it?</p>
<p>You just proved his point about bias and you didn&#8217;t even realize it.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not bias if you look at all the products and decide that only one is the best, is it?</p>
<p>Macs, iPhones, iPads etc are all popular devices for a reason, they are well designed and provide a good user experience. Are there other devices that also do this? Of course. But liking Apple products doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re biased.</p>
<p>Oh, so popularity = what is best? Then Android would like to have a word with you.</p>
<p>Just saying. Popularity != quality.</p>
<p>&#8220;liking Apple products doesn’t mean you’re biased.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, but being steeped in a culture of Apple products is definitely something to consider. Bias isn&#8217;t always intentional or malicious, it&#8217;s sometimes a byproduct of upbringing.</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;m just commenting that I don&#8217;t really think there&#8217;s any real bias on The Verge. Of course there are subjective elements to reviewing anything, that&#8217;s part of the point, but I don&#8217;t think any brand gets inflated scores just for its name.</p>
<p>The people complaining about bias are usually the ones with long comment histories attacking one brand and defending another in my experience.</p>
<p>That is not the weird part.  The weird part is having a blind faith that anything Apple makes will be leagues ahead of everything else while in reality they only hot that point once in a while (still a good record, but they are not gods).</p>
<p>My example of the iPad mini speculation way before parts or any confirmation cropped up and comparing it to the released Nexus 7 is a prime example of this.  People were literally arguing about something they had no idea about, relying solely that one would have a fruit on it and another would not.</p>
<p>To reiterate, liking a product is not bias &#8230; preemptively liking products points towards some general bias.</p>
<p>Nope, not when historically the company that makes those products has a history of making good products. That&#8217;s not bias, it&#8217;s just common sense.</p>
<p>When comparing it a current great option, it is bias if the deciding factor is brand.  The reason behind it is not relevant.</p>
<p>It becomes destructive bias when that bias lingers into comparisons with other things and that has already popped up.</p>
<p>Damn do I need an edit button, I&#8217;m not even going to try and fix this.</p>
<p>Late nights really do hurt the good &#8217;ole mind.</p>
<p>Yes, it wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with more enjoyable products. At all.</p>
<p>/facepalm</p>
<p>Amazing how much people bitch about The Verge being biased here.</p>
<p>Funny how you say they are Apple biased but Microsoft fans say they are Androd biased.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like it here, just leave. There is no point of sticking around trying to win the fanboy fight of the century.</p>
<p>Another &#8220;no longer available&#8221; popup when I tried too</p>
<p>Prediction: Google Maps is so popular, it crashes Apple&#8217;s iTunes servers.</p>
<p>So what is the best time to download? Now or wait for a day? I don&#8217;t want to contribute to a mass DDoS attack</p>
<p>There are so many thousands of simultaneous downloads on the App Store at all times it isn&#8217;t going to make a difference,  it not even that large of an app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually not so sure about that. Never has an app been so hotly anticipated that it will probably make the news.</p>
<p>I update several apps a day and download new ones many days.  An additional couple megs isn&#8217;t going to make much difference when people are already constantly pulling data from the store.  Some days even large apps make it to the top of the charts (since that&#8217;s dominated by games which are much larger downloads).   I do expect google maps will be in the top list for of while if not #1.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Apple was ready for this.</p>
<p>Uh they&#8217;ve known about it for a least a couple weeks, no? :)</p>
<p>Maybe they thought people were cool with the Apple Maps.</p>
<p>Even if I were cool with them I&#8217;d still download it if its free.  I downloaded Nokia&#8217;s crappy app ;)</p>
<p>I doubt it, Apple wasn&#8217;t cool with Apple Maps</p>
<p>You know they approved the app right..?  Apple was probably behind the quick release for all we know,  we have no idea what these two are up to.  But I am sure it is not the schoolyard fight portrayed on blogs..</p>
<p>Apple knew perfectly well that Google would work on a third party app after they dropped it from default inclusion? Same as youtube?</p>
<p>Now Apple people can feel the pain that Android users went through trying to get a Nexus 4 :P</p>
<p>This is a win-win for all of us. Congrats Google, you finally did it.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my question: Apple is going to have to dump a ton of resources into its Maps offering. If people flock back to Google Maps and use it more than Apple Maps, is it wasteful for Apple to continue on with its Maps? In short, can Apple win this battle and should they even try?</p>
<p>Good Question</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have to &#8220;win&#8221; they just need to compete. More choices is better for everyone. Withou Apple releasing their maps we would not have a vastly improved Google offering.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stick with Apple maps because where I live it&#8217;s actually as good or better than google&#8217;s web maps for data and its integrated. I gain a lot, and lose nothing. There is no reason we can&#8217;t have both.</p>
<p>&#8220;more choice is better&#8221; : like when you can&#8217;t choose you default app for maps, for instance?</p>
<p>No, like when the app is actually available in the AppStore and the number of times there isn&#8217;t an app on Google Play :)</p>
<p>for info, google is about to beat apple at the &#8220;biggest-number of apps game&#8221;. Noticed how they no longer brag about them during keynotes recently?</p>
<p>Numbers don&#8217;t mean shit if the quality of the apps suck.</p>
<p>they will move on to quality. They would have every right too.</p>
<p>Are you able to chose a default app other than googles own maps on android.  If that&#8217;s what you wan than get a google device.</p>
<p>Totally agree with you. Google heals out on iOS for the longest so when apple took off maps apple forces their hand and the made a great app with features they didn&#8217;t want to include in iOS maps prior to ios6. This is a win for all consumers. I would even say a win for apple.</p>
<p>Tell that to their stocks&#8230;</p>
<p>Depends if Google was wanting more per client access than it will cost to fix.. which is the difference between infinite (over time) money and finite money.</p>
<p>Apple has, what do they claim. +200 million iOS clients in the field. Even at an annual access rate of $1 per client per year.. with more devices being sold it won&#8217;t take long before it = $1 billion dollars. Would it cost a billion dollars to make some decent maps, seems doubtful</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, can Apple win this battle and should they even try?&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably not, and yes, because competition breeds better products.</p>
<p>No. The majority of people won&#8217;t download the app because they either won&#8217;t care or wouldn&#8217;t have heard about Google Maps being out. We&#8217;re talking about the majority of smartphone users in general here. Plus there&#8217;s still an extra step to get to the Google app rather than use the native map which will still be used by default. Apple will still be gathering a lot more data from iOS users than Google.</p>
<p>No, I still want Apple maps. It integrates better with Siri and other services. Google maps will be for my transit and backup gps. If I can&#8217;t find a location on Apple maps then I pull up Google maps.</p>
<p>Until Apple allows Google and other 3rd parties to integrate with iOS there&#8217;s no chance Google Maps will overtake Apple Maps. But on a level playing field, I wouldn&#8217;t bet against Google.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s great about Apple Maps, you can integrate into it. For example there&#8217;s no transit directions until you install a compatible app. Once installed, you get a vastly superior experience with transit data direct from source.</p>
<p>It may also be a question of prestige. They will want to show that they are competent and relevant. You can&#8217;t have premium prices if you are not considered cool.</p>
<p>Theres no indoor maps, and it doesnt have offline caching the way that Androids Google Maps does&#8230;.. That makes it inferior in every way except for subjective ways on things like how it LOOKS to on person versus another&#8230;.</p>
<p>Its pretty disingenuous for them to say its better than the Android version when it literally isn&#8217;t, and is missing features Android has.</p>
<p>True&#8230;It is cleaner, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the Maps team is prepping us for a Major Android Maps overhaul.  Since Android Maps has more fetures and is more baked into the OS..it probably takes a little bit more time.</p>
<p>This is just the first release. I&#8217;m sure iphone users will be getting that in v2 or v3.</p>
<p>YOU GUYS KNEW THIS WHOLE TIME???</p>
<p><img src="http://4chandata.org/images/threads/122689_you-what-have-you-done.jpg" /></p>
<p>How you like dem apples!?</p>
<p>Finally&#8230;.Thank you Google</p>
<p>Hopefully the Android version is getting updated soon, because it looks way cleaner on iOS</p>
<p>So&#8230; Is there latitude integration like in the android app?</p>
<p>doubt it</p>
<p>No.  It is still a separate app.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bit redundant&#8230;</p>
<p>mapgate is finally over!</p>
<p>Well, not really. Apple Maps is still there. You just see those &#8220;gates&#8221; now because you&#8217;re on Google. ;)</p>
<p>One thing you should all know: the iOS Google Maps doesn&#8217;t have voice navigation. Still no full feature parity. My move to Nexus 4 seems better than ever.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used it but I have read the article. And I think it says that there is spoken navigation even when you are in other apps. I could be wrong though&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going by this: <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/12/12/google-maps-ios-report" target="_blank">http://mashable.com/2012/12/12/google-maps-ios-report</a></p>
<p>Gotta try it and see I guess.</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t allow Apple to put voice navigation in Apple&#8217;s version of the Google Maps app. This version of the app has it.</p>
<p>Ah. Ignore me folks lol.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m sure the Nexus 4 is still great :-P</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>According to the video is has to be enabled.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have to enable it. Just worked for me without issue this morning on my way to work.</p>
<p>Wrong</p>
<p>Maybe now my friend will upgrade from iOS <em>4</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>HA! My girlfriend still uses iOS 4.</p>
<p>Now we just need to pray for Apple to let us change the default apps&#8230; Or get rid from theirs. And hopefully navigation works in other languages and countries, not only the ones that Apple likes.</p>
<p>Well if it comes to that I hope they let us get rid of Stock, Weather and all the other forgotten crap I haven&#8217;t used since iOS2</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not downloading. It keeps saying that its no longer available.</p>
<p>This is sexual!</p>
<p>^Best comment on this page. +3 internets to you.</p>
<p>Sweet. Clean design and fast.</p>
<p>Time to ditch the web app. Adios!</p>
<p>Like many other posters, getting unavailable currently in the app store</p>
<p>Bah. No iPad support yet.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s down, clicking the link says its no longer available. Also searching the App Store yields nothing.</p>
<p>It always takes a few hours for apps to fully propagate the store.</p>
<p>Try (on your iPhone) going to any other Google app, then to "related" then to "more by google" then to "see all" then download google maps, then enjoy :)</p>
<p>Good catch, hasn&#8217;t poped up in the Australian store but it appears there.</p>
<p>I had to go to iTunes on my COMPUTER, search for &#8220;Google&#8221;, then click on any of their apps, say, Google Search.  Then on the top left you&#8217;ll see under the apps name, &#8220;Google Inc.&#8221;  Clicking that shows you all their apps&#8230;.its on the far right, a lower case g with the red location marker :-)</p>
<p><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8269110372_4d0e13ed7b.jpg" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaywontdart/8268042735/sizes/o/in/photostream/">Screenshot of the full details of the Google Maps app here, its 7MB in size</a></p>
<p>Just wait for it to propagate &#8230; this happens with all new apps.</p>
<p>I just got to download it &#8212; this thing is nice! I like how you can use the compass with street view, wow!</p>
<p>FYI, there is voice in navigation.</p>
<p>Still jailbroken on 5.0.1&#8230; And it requires 5.1.</p>
<p>So jailbreak on version 5.1.1!</p>
<p>Just upgrade to the latest iOS. You&#8217;ll soon get over your jailbreak attachment like I did. :)</p>
<p>Except that I won&#8217;t. ;) I like having BiteSMS, thanks. It&#8217;s the only really good reason I have to jailbreak at all anymore.</p>
<p>Now that this is here, and the new Gmail too, I no longer have any reservations about switching from Android and sticking with the iPhone.</p>
<p>Why does Gmail and Maps look far better on iOS? I hope Google spreads the love&#8230;</p>
<p>To what BB?</p>
<p>Only thing I can think of right now is Google wants to make peace with Apple, I had switched to my Galaxy Nexus but I switched back to my iPhone 5 because of GMail and Maps.</p>
<p>Long live Google, you cared for people and not competition.</p>
<p>Wow, I was definitely wrong when I said Google apps were only good on Android..<br />
 <br />
<blockquote>Google finally delivers what might be the best option on any smartphone — Android included</blockquote></p>
<p>This is what should have been done from the start. As a long time Apple fan/user, in my opinion, Apple never should have released their own maps solution until Google had its own standalone app on the store. The forced competition between the two companies has been great for consumers though. When Google was caught off guard by Apple&#8217;s removal of apps, it forced a hasty release of 3D maps on their end. Now Apple will have to play catchup to integrate a better mapping system in their OS which will also force innovation on their part. In the meantime, users of iOS can rely on the stability of Google Maps for commutes, transit etc. In my opinion, it is a win win for Android and iOS users alike.</p>
<p>Hssty?</p>
<p>Testing it on my iPhone 5 and my Nexus 4, it is definitely a bit more speedy and less laggy on the iPhone.  When you scroll fast, the Nexus 4 screen turns white, and then you have to wait a second for it to actually render the image.  When you scroll fast on the iPhone, the image stays, and the image clarifies a bit faster.   Both phones were on the exact same wifi network.</p>
<p>That said, the Android version definitely has a few extra features like offline mode, but pretty damn impressive for the competition.</p>
<p>I think it helps Google to test out this design and possibly bring some of it to Android.</p>
<p>Even Google&#8217;rs use iPhone, that&#8217;s why. I mean they&#8217;re Apple fans too. Probably everyone uses a mac and iPods over there.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not downloading saying no longer available</p>
<p>No iPad support&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;.Yet. It&#8217;s coming.</p>
<blockquote>it&#8217;s not designed to work on the iPad. Google says that will come later.</blockquote>
<p>I want Google Maps on my iPad and I want it&#8230;soon.</p>
<p>I want to see how fast Google Maps become&#8217;s the App Stores number 1 app</p>
<p>By tomorrow morning</p>
<p>Yep. </p>
<p>Yarp.</p>
<p>I tried downloading it, entered my password, then it said it was no longer available.</p>
<p>I now see why they did a night release&#8230;the are about to blow Apple&#8217;s servers up</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t blowing the servers up. It always takes a bit for new apps to propagate throughout the servers.</p>
<p>I actually still prefer Apple&#8217;s Maps for design. Google trying to put holo UI on iPhone just looks bad. It&#8217;s like designing an aqua UI on windows, or aero on Mac.</p>
<p>what aspects of the Holo design language do you not like?</p>
<p>On Android there is a long list of UI inconsistencies, quirks and, IMO just bad choices; in this app though, some parts just don&#8217;t &#8220;fit&#8221; I guess. I just prefer Apple&#8217;s aesthetic not just with the UI elements, but also with the map design.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a known Troll, ignore him.</p>
<p>Yes, how dare anyone offer criticism and opinion. Fall back in line lemming.</p>
<p>There are quite a few lemmings to choose from though, you could be a builder, or a bridge, or a bomb&#8230;</p>
<p>Someone that doesn&#8217;t like something that you like does not a troll make.</p>
<p>Ummm &#8211; I don&#8217;t use Android, but judging by this review, and other comments, I don&#8217;t believe the Android version of Maps or the rest of Android looks like this.<br />
I think the new gmail app, and this app look gorgeous.</p>
<p>The Google Maps for Android UI actually looks outdated in many places. The Navigation app isn&#8217;t Holo themed at all.</p>
<p>So do apps following the Holo guideline look like this? I was under the impression that Holo was more grey and often uses a bright blue as an accent. Gmail 2.0, the new Maps for iOS, and Google Now all look excellent to my eyes. If the rest of Android follows, then I may need to switch.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is Holo. It might have some elements of it, but Google seems to have created a new UI style for its services on iOS. The maps and gmail are really beautiful and different from their android versions.</p>
<p>But which do you prefer for navigation?</p>
<p>Congrads to iPhone owners on finally getting maps back.  For us Android users be patient I have a feeling our Google Apps are going to start changing. YouTube and Current&#8217;s show what design language Android is moving to&#8230;so we will see what happens.</p>
<p>Seems public transport directions aren&#8217;t working in Australia</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ausgeeks.com/2012/12/13/google-maps-for-ios-released/" target="_blank">http://www.ausgeeks.com/2012/12/13/google-maps-for-ios-released/</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s weird, they obviously have the data available.</p>
<p>Yeah, it launched here a few months ago and works fine on Android</p>
<p>Probably reflective of our public transport in general don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>It is working, sort of;</p>
<p>If you tap on a bus stop, train station or ferry wharf (example, try Sydney) it shows the timetables. If you do directions and tap the train icon at the top, it gives the directions via public transport. If you just tap the &#8220;Public transit&#8221; section in the sidebar, nothing loads and says it isn&#8217;t available in the region.</p>
<p>TL;DR &#8211; It works. Just don&#8217;t tap public transit in the sidebar.</p>
<p>It works for public transport directions here in Canberra but pressing the public transport buttons brings up a transit data not available warning&#8230;. Odd</p>
<p>Lies. Lies, lies, lies!<br />
It is &#8220;no longer available&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting that too!</p>
<p>&#8230;And I was so excited!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just the error message. Give it time.  If you&#8217;re in the US go to bed :)</p>
<p>Interesting&#8230;Search, GMail, Maps&#8230;I think Calendar is next..watch Google Calendar for iPhone coming soon.</p>
<p>Oh Chrome. Google is turning the iPhone into a Google Phone 1 app at a time,</p>
<p>Oh god I hope so. I hope they absolutely overhaul Google Calendar for web while they&#8217;re at it. Google Calendar on the web looks downright atrocious.</p>
<p>THE ROCK SAYS: Finally, the Google Maps has comeback, to iOS!!!</p>
<p>sadly im probably the only person that got this!</p>
<p>If you smell&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah if you were in a vegetative state throughout the 90s and early 00&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p>Google is literally the G.O.A.T.</p>
<p>Speed and fluidity aside, these are definitely NOT vector maps. Bitmap tiles are clearly loading at different locations and zoom sizes (and I&#8217;m talking basic view, not satellite view).</p>
<p>But maybe that&#8217;s location dependent. I&#8217;m in NC and the B-footage above clearly shows some vector 3D building display.</p>
<p>But I think this is the same data set as Android &#8211; vector buildings but with the majority of the mapset in tiles, unlike Apple&#8217;s inaccurate but all-vector data set.</p>
<p>You do realize that it can still be tiles, it&#8217;s just tiles of vector data instead of bitmaps.</p>
<p>If tiles of images are loading, it&#8217;s bitmap data.</p>
<p>Vector underlying it perhaps, but bit map tiles are more data to load than just the pure vector data set.</p>
<p>This is how apps are rolled out people, stop complaining <br />

<p>GOTY.</p>
<p>Never had an issues with apple maps in stl. It always got me where I needed to go. I&#8217;ll download google maps and see if there&#8217;s a difference. Other than lower quality voice. At least it&#8217;s there&#8230; Right? And free&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find it by searching. I went to this article on my iPhone to use the source link and found it in the app store but it will not let me download saying that the app is no longer available.</p>
<p>Low quality voice? Voice navigation seemed fine to me on my way to work this morning.</p>
<p>Anybody else having trouble downloading?</p>
<p>Yes, can&#8217;t get it in Connecticut right now. See it on iTunes but won&#8217;t let me download;  doesn&#8217;t show in iPhone or iPad app stores.</p>
<p>Down in DC, can find only by clicking a direct link and once there cannot download.</p>
<p>Go to any Google developed app, scroll down and tap "Developer Info," and Maps will be in the list. Just downloaded it now (9:02 PM PST)</p>
<p>Quite the secret this has been. TheVerge has a Google Maps package already to go the moment it&#8217;s set free.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unavailable. WTF?</p>
<p>So why is Apple allowing Google Maps on there beloved iPhone if they want nothing to do with them?</p>
<p>Why? Because they screwed up royally and they&#8217;re eating some humble pie.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the uproar if they&#8217;d found a pseudo-reason to keep this from landing in the app store!</p>
<p>They have plenty of Google apps on the App Store. The scaremongering stories were just link bait for those with special needs.</p>
<p>Because the iPhone supports non-Apple apps.</p>
<p>Think the better questions is why didn&#8217;t google allow apple to use its maps with these features when apple asked them before making the decision to ditch google maps.</p>
<p>Because Apple doesn&#8217;t make it&#8217;s money by knowing as much about you as possible. Google doesn&#8217;t want to give out features without a little user data honey coming back their way. No such thing as a free lunch. Apple is spending a fortune on a maps app that won&#8217;t really monetize for them the same way Gogles does.</p>
<p>Why would they?<br />
Apple was just licensing the map data from them. All the additional features are Google propriety features. They are free but not open source. Why would they just hand it over to Apple on platter? This is what many people don&#8217;t know. Maps and other Google apps are not open source. <br />
Google would want to have their own app with complete control over it if they are to give access to all features of theirs.</p>
<p>Where is it? :&#8217;(</p>
<p>I just downloaded it from iTunes and synced it that way.  Couldn&#8217;t find it in app store on phone.</p>
<p>Same here. No go when using the app store on my 4s. I had to sync using the computer.</p>
<p>I think Yelp just got scared&#8230;Hello, Zaggat ;)</p>
<p>Yelp is vastly more popular nowadays than Zagat.</p>
<p>time will tell</p>
<p>Time already did.</p>
<p>Nothing is forever.  Yahoo learned this the hard way.  Yelp integration in Apple Maps will go head to head with Zaggat integration in Google Maps.  As Google Maps has more users in desktop and in mobile, there is a huge possibility it becomes a major contender.</p>
<p>Except that Yelp is still relevant outside of Apple maps. Zagat? Not so much.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re both largely useless outside the US.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s unfortunate because Yelp is a scam. They&#8217;ve tried to extort money from my family and several of our friends for positive reviews on the site. They&#8217;ve removed several positive reviews from our businesses because we refused to pay them.</p>
<p>lol no. Foursquare &gt; Yelp &gt; Zaggat (who uses this piece of crap?)</p>
<p>Im sorry but a Zagat rated establishment is more reputable than Yelp.  Its like Rotten Tomatoes VS Roger Ebert. Or is it a piece of crap because its now owned by Google?</p>
<p>This, my friend, is called an opinion&#8230; It is commonly stated as fact, but in reality isn&#8217;t because people can disagree with it. Personally I take Rotten Tomatoes over an old crusty guy who thinks his word is gospel when it comes to movies&#8230; You know why? Cause RT/Yelp gives me multiple people&#8217;s opinions&#8230; Not one &#8220;expert&#8221;.</p>
<p>No, it was a piece of crap before and still is. No matter the owner.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id585027354?mt=8" target="_blank">https://itunes.apple.com/app/id585027354?mt=8</a></p>
<p>I just erased every other Maps app I had on my 4S before the download even finished.</p>
<p>My phone now has maps, moving up in the world!</p>
<p>W00t, SUBWAY DIRECTIONS!</p>
<p>Thank you Christmas Unicorn!</p>
<p>iTunes on desktop says it&#8217;s temporarily unavailable. App store on the iPhone says it&#8217;s no longer available.</p>
<p>LOL this is funny.on startup first time it has a big accept button to hit saying BE CAREFUL IT&#8217;s in BETA! Doh.  Better to be safe than sorry maybe Apple should of done this&#8230;﻿</p>
<p>Apple, why won&#8217;t you let me download Google Maps?</p>
<p>Go to any Google developed app, scroll down and tap "Developer Info," and Maps will be in the list. Just downloaded it now (9:02 PM PST)</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t do it anymore. No longer available.</p>
<p>I restarted my phone, then I could download it.  I&#8217;m not sure if was related or not.</p>
<p>It takes time to propagate across the world. Every app does this.</p>
<p>The video is kind of funny.  I thought maybe it was a Google promotional video due to the high hipster-fashion involved, but&#8230;  wow.  And the subway stop is the L, presumably Williamsburg.  Perhaps this is subtle humor, the models just look too perfectly Urban Outfitted.</p>
<p>The L is the best train.</p>
<p>If you mean one of the most consistently crowded, then yes.</p>
<p>if you like watching hipsters from the mid west get stared at angrily by real new yorkers.</p>
<p>/fucking bedford ave</p>
<p>Since when did this site start having novelty accounts?</p>
<p>Now update the android app with that pretty interface, and revamp the Navigation app. Google pls</p>
<p>Now waiting for an update to let it find addresses in my address book&#8230;</p>
<p>ditto</p>
<p>Prima facie, looks better than Android maps app on my Gnex. Much smoother and faster on my 4S. Secondly, a big improvement over maps on android, alternative routes appear in the maps app itself. In Android, you have to jump to the seperate Navigation app to see alternative routes which is stupid and absurd (Why Google has a seperate nav app in the first place is beyond me).</p>
<p>Now what is missing is offline. The SDK is great too.</p>
<p>Nice to know that the Navigation UI is still as ugly as ever. When is Google going to update it for Android?</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m assuming the people that said iOS maps is fine won&#8217;t be downloading this?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll download it to try it out. But Apple maps is better here in Denver than Google Maps is online, so it would be a step down for me as a default app.</p>
<p>Interesting</p>
<p>Better in the sense that I yelp was always better and more accurate than Google for things I searched for, geographic data for Apple maps is, as far as I can tell, perfect here, and google maps transit directions were wrong more often than right when I used it. Had to always go to the RTD site anyway.</p>
<p>Google maps are still top notch, but Apple wins on integration, and ease of use. And design, IMO.</p>
<p>Interesting. </p>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>To try it out, sure. But not with the immediate intention to make it my default maps app.</p>
<p>I see what you did there&#8230;..</p>
<p>Haha, took me a second to see it as well.<br />
Yeah, unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t even if I wanted to without jailbreaking, but I of course meant my go-to maps app.</p>
<p>Apple maps is fine and I downloaded Google Maps also. Running the two side by side seems Apple actually has better business listings in my neighbourhood thanks to Yelp and I prefer the look of Apple maps. I&#8217;ll be using Gpogle maps for street view and when I go to Mildura. And I&#8217;ll be using Mud Maps next time I go out bush.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re a sucker if you put all your eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>Nope,  I&#8217;m in a small town in the UK and Apple Maps works fine for me.</p>
<p>So I guess the thermonuclear war has been called off? Good for you guys. BFF again, I see.</p>
<p>I have a feeling some mapping specialists in Cupertino are getting chills up their spines&#8230; time to dig up those resumes, people.</p>
<p>Just got it. Found it by going into Google Earth on app store and then searching for related apps&#8230; Google Maps was the last app listed. Downloaded it.</p>
<p>Ironically enough they&#8217;re advertising a Motorola Phone on The Verge Homepage with Google Maps as the main selling point&#8230;</p>
<p>Adblock Plus will take care of that for you&#8230;  Thank god I still have control over what I see on the Internet.  How much longer that freedom lasts is anybodies guess.</p>
<p>Sorry for the off topic rant.</p>
<p>Ad blockers are lame</p>
<p>FALSE. ad-blockers are one of the greatest software utilities  ever made. the best part is you get so used to it being there and updating itself quietly that you are really only aware it exists when you visit a site in a browser without ad-block and you see a smattering of annoying flashy ads clogging up your screen and wasting bandwidth.</p>
<p>I like supporting the sites I visit by letting their ads display.</p>
<p>Call me old here but back in pre-2001 Internet the ads were simple and not intrusive or dangerous.  Bring me back those ads and I&#8217;ll remove adblocker.</p>
<p>Anyone else getting this? <br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/29Kck"><img title="Hosted by imgur.com" src="http://i.imgur.com/29Kck.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Me. :-(</p>
<p>I just exited the app store after about 5 minutes and tried again and it downloaded just fine</p>
<p>Next time try that prior to posting.</p>
<p>I got it just fine and dandy but after informing my brother he gets this&#8230;.rather unfortunate&#8230;</p>
<p>Traffic for sure, retry in a few moments.</p>
<p>Not trolling, but this is an incredibly embarrassing moment for Apple.</p>
<p>How?<br />
Was it embarrassing when google released Chrome? Gmail? Search?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, no.</p>
<p>Actually, no, no, no.</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m not sure if you remember this, but Apple dropped Google Maps to develop their own mapping system.  There were mixed reports about whether this was a surprise or not for Google.  Upon release, the new mapping system was torn apart by the tech media and interblog.  In the few months following, Apple fixed many issues, but Google quickly developed a superior app that was released today.  Chrome, gmail, and search are irrelevant because those apps were not endorsed and then abandoned by Apple.</p>
<p>I hope that helps you understand!  The internet can be a tough place for readin&#8217; stuff!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not superior for me.<br />
It&#8217;s not embarrassing for Apple that google released a maps app.<br />
It&#8217;s great for google. But it actually isn&#8217;t going to affect Apple much long term.</p>
<p>Oh so you&#8217;ve used it then?</p>
<p>Yes. I downloaded it already and messed around with it. It&#8217;s a very good app, but it&#8217;s not superior to Apples map in my area, or, at a glance, the few other cities I travel to often. Equal in some ways, lacking in others. A pretty even trade off overall. Apple&#8217;s turn by turn seems better, not only in routes, but also in integration (which isn&#8217;t exactly google&#8217;s fault)</p>
<p>I think it will effect Apple in the long term, because mapping data is based on user usage.  If a significant number of users move to Google for their mapping it will reduce the amount of mapping data Apple has in addition to reducing it&#8217;s accuracy.  I think as the months go by and people start collecting data on what mapping apps folks are using we will have a clearer picture.</p>
<p>Just like Chrome was supposed to completely kill how people used Safari on the iPhone?</p>
<p>Hmm I would have never predicted that, as Safari has a better browsing experience than Chrome.</p>
<p>Look at that, we agree on something.</p>
<p>Plenty of people did try and predict that though.</p>
<p>how so? seriously i&#8217;d like to know specific reasons why you feel that way.  my opinion couldn&#8217;t be more at odds.</p>
<p>when people talk like this i&#8217;m always left with the impression that they are simply are used to  established convention and mistakenly interpret that experience as  objectively &#8216;better&#8217; when it&#8217;s entirely subjective.</p>
<p>I would love to know the reasons as well.  I still hate IE and I used to use Safari day in and day out but I have a much better experience on Chrome than Safari.</p>
<p>I only use Safari on my iPhone to save animated Gifs. Other that, it&#8217;s all Chrome, all the time.</p>
<p>I think you may be living in a geek bubble I&#8217;m afraid. The vast amount of people out there won&#8217;t even know Google Maps even exist or care. In tech circles yes, it will get downloaded, but will this ever get more use than the default Apple Maps? No.</p>
<p>Most young educated people are aware of and use Google Maps.  Certainly ALL my friends with iPhones are aware of the Maps fiasco and since TIME even picked up this story, it&#8217;s fair to say the average person is now aware of the Google Maps app as well.</p>
<p>As of right now Google Maps is the top trend on CNN</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/trends/?hpt=hp_zite1_featured" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/trends/?hpt=hp_zite1_featured</a></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s over stories of a plot to kill and castrate Justin Beiber.</p>
<p><strong></strong>erhmm.. I think the embarrassing moment for Apple happened a while ago when they released their shitty maps app.. and then apologized for it and fired a few people &#8212; not their finest hour.</p>
<p>If anything, this is a better moment for them.. now iOS has a decent Google maps app (finally) as well as their own map option which isn&#8217;t that terrible for some users (depending on what services you need and where you live)</p>
<p>Google developed and released a superior app several months after being dropped by Apple.  Yeah, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s another goof up.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not trolling&#8230;. you&#8217;re calling like it is. Some people just can&#8217;t handle it.</p>
<p>Apple just got an app that is better on their platform than their maker&#8217;s platform. How is that embarrassing?</p>
<p>Er why?</p>
<p>Yet again Google makes their iOS version better than Android. Ughh&#8230;. this is incredibly frustrating for me as an Android user.</p>
<p>imo, the article was being a bit hyperbolic in extolling the virtues of Google Maps for iPhone. I&#8217;m sure Maps will be updated on Android soon enough.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder what Google&#8217;s end game with Android is. Am I just a beta tester? I makes me want to switch, but I can&#8217;t stand iOS.</p>
<p>They want to know everything about you and display ads to you no matter what phone you use.</p>
<p>Unless you use Windows phone though apparently.</p>
<p>Sigh. This is true. I like my lumia 920 but I really miss maps. Nokia maps is nowhere any good as Google maps. Hell even Apple maps is better here in Canada than Nokia maps.</p>
<p>Good thing I have my iPhone 4S as a backup phone. Hehehe</p>
<p>Ah, of course. I wish they could change their business model to something more&#8230; honorable?</p>
<p>Well, honorable is relative isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>I think 96% of their revenue is from display ads, and the more user data they have the more they can target the ads and keep ahead of their advertising competitors.</p>
<p>Apple represents a risk to Google because they control their platform so much, but in my opinion Facebook is the bigger threat. If they figure out how to do ads well with the data they have, it could take a big chunk of Google&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p>Yes, but I like it when things are a bit more transparent. As far as I know, Apple&#8217;s business model is just to sell me hardware locked into a particular ecosystem and keep me dependent on them.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s lets me do what I want, in return for information they can use to target ads specifically at me.</p>
<p>Now while Apple&#8217;s has this sickening dependency ring to it, it&#8217;s somewhat more transparent than Google&#8217;s. At face value, I know exactly how much I am worth to them. Google on the other hand, heaven knows.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re lucky that you&#8217;re free to buy or use these products and services or not.</p>
<p>Apple makes great hardware with a matched OS, on iOS you have a little less control than Android, but some prefer the usability, some don&#8217;t. If you don&#8217;t like your Mac, iPad, iPhone, return it, or buy a competing device. There&#8217;s no lock in.</p>
<p>With Google you can use their free services or not. If you do you get generally unobtrusive ads displayed. It&#8217;s an amazing time to be interested in technology, there&#8217;s no point in being overly loyal to one company or another.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not overly loyal to one, I use a Mac and I love my Nexus 4. With that being said, my point is that the amount of information Google has about me is disconcerting and I feel uneasy that my choice of Android is making it easy for them to grow their data farm of me.</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel the same way, but I still use GMail, Maps, Reader etc I don&#8217;t know what the answer is if you&#8217;re really concerned about your privacy other than not using their services. But Google at least don&#8217;t release your information to third parties, unlike Facebook (Which I don&#8217;t use for this reason).</p>
<p>Having used both Android and iOS devices extensively, I can say conclusively that this whole Apple &#8220;dependency ring&#8221; as you call it is a myth. Never once have I felt locked into Apple&#8217;s ecosystem. Switching from iOS to Android or OS X to Windows and back is as painless as switching between any other platforms. I really don&#8217;t see where people get this idea that you&#8217;re locked into Apple&#8217;s ecosystem if you use their devices.</p>
<p>That really depends on the user and what they need their phone to do.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s services aren&#8217;t cross platform. iTunes, iBooks, e.t.c</p>
<p>itunes is, the DRM&#8217;d movie / tv shows aren&#8217;t. iCloud is all based on standards, (webdav/caldav/carddav etc.)</p>
<p>iTune&#8217;s&#8230;meh&#8230;.Google Music isn&#8217;t really cross platform, but at least there is a Web App.  You get none of the above with iTunes.  So I don&#8217;t consider it cross-platform on the mobile side.</p>
<p>iCloud is not cross platform.</p>
<p>iCloud is not cross platform.</p>
<p>could you tell my nexus? Cause i got the calendar on it pretty easily. It uses standards for a lot of services.</p>
<p>sorry, the beginning was meant to be in box quotes, but i failed.</p>
<p>No matter what happens android users will have the best maps&#8230; Apple can decide tomorrow to pull the app. Google will take care of Android. Whoever argues that Google doesn&#8217;t have the best maps on iOS is just going themselves.</p>
<p>Going =fooling</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t the review say this is the best maps option on any device?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way Apple will pull this app, and Google have a great incentive to provide apps on all platforms, user data and advertising.</p>
<p>Just like apple pulled other apps that they thought replicated functions. We don&#8217;t know what apple might do. Its their ecosystem.  You must know something I don&#8217;t. Google is now just another developer to apple. Apple has more power over Google. All Google can do is crank out awesome apps that people love on iOS. If it gets pulled all Google has to say is apple pulled it not us.</p>
<p>Apple had to publicly apologise for their Maps app. That is a big deal for a company. There&#8217;s no way they will risk further tarnishing their image by pulling this app.</p>
<p> Sorry I can&#8217;t agree with on that.</p>
<p>Apple has a specific and prominent section in the App Store dedicated to 3rd party Maps. No, they won&#8217;t pull this app.</p>
<p>Calm yourself.</p>
<p>That was their old excuse, but really the only type they limit now, is browsers.</p>
<p>As any former or current  XP user knows, that&#8217;s a vulnerability area&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah evidently we do know something you don&#8217;t. Like if Apple wanted to &#8220;pull it tomorrow&#8221; they just wouldn&#8217;t have allowed it in the AppStore in the first place.</p>
<p>Because has never pulled an app?</p>
<p>Not for any reason you&#8217;re implying would happen here.</p>
<p>If you say so.</p>
<p>Apple hasn&#8217;t pulled apps for &#8220;duplicate functionality&#8221; for a good while now. Their policy on the app store has improved but you&#8217;d prefer to not believe that so that Apple remains clearly evil?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how people that don&#8217;t use Apple products always know the most about them?</p>
<p>same as it ever was. there are plenty of misinformed people in the apple camp too,  my dear.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s their ecosystem they can do what they please. How is that evil? I would do the same.</p>
<blockquote>Just like apple pulled other apps that they thought replicated functions</blockquote>
<p>You must be talking about iOS 3.</p>
<p>I use iOS. Also other platforms. And it has happened recently. Not just iOS 3.</p>
<p>How is it better. You need to chill its just an app in which I&#8217;m sure the android client has a nice big update coming soon. Even that the android version is really good.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right.. Can&#8217;t wait</p>
<p>The same thing happened with Google+. They updated the iOS version first but when they updated the Android version it was better. Give it time.</p>
<p>I was able to download it! I had to go on iTunes. I&#8217;m excited. :D</p>
<p>I wonder if Google would have added turn by turn directions to their maps app had Apple not done <em>their </em>maps app..</p>
<p>it looks like it all (eventually) worked out in the end.</p>
<p>competition.. it works.</p>
<p>Yes perfect example of why competition always benefits the consumer.</p>
<p>The previous version of maps.app (google) was still coded by Apple IIRC, but plugged into gmaps through the usual API.</p>
<p>Yup&#8230; It all turned out well for Apple in the end. Besides their own Maps App (Which lets face it: Was never even half as bad as people, who for the most part never tried it, made it out to be) they have a much improved Google Maps available now.</p>
<p>Finally, downloaded. I guess Apple&#8217;s servers are hit hard.</p>
<p>No. Christ people are clueless.<br />
Every app released on the App Store takes time to propagate.</p>
<p>I still think their servers are getting hit hard.  The probably didn&#8217;t scale up capacity for the release of the Maps app like they do for new versions of the OS.</p>
<p>This is a tiny app compared to some of the games that are also very popular.</p>
<p>That is why its trending on twitter right? What iOS game has actually trended at 9:30PM</p>
<p>I mean tiny in download size, not popularity.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if the app store couldn&#8217;t handle the load, but it&#8217;s well known that apps take a while to become available worldwide.</p>
<p>Basically that is what I am saying Apple&#8217;s servers cannot handle a huge load like that in the middle of the night.  Look it happens, &#8230;it is what it is, none of us work in Apple&#8217;s Data Center, so it is whatever.</p>
<p>You might be right, but the worldwide spread of apps for download is known to take a little bit of time and the issues people are reporting seem consistent with that.</p>
<p>Ummm, the amount of bandwidth this app is using is a blip on the radar of Apple&#8217;s servers in the overall scheme of things.</p>
<p>The video embedding that the Verge uses is maddeningly unpredictable.</p>
<p>Will there be an iPad version?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it will come. Example was the Youtube app, proper iPad support came later.</p>
<p>Google told Pogue the iPad version and offline maps are coming.</p>
<p>Was waiting for this&#8230; only to find out it&#8217;s not available in my country (SL). Assholes!</p>
<p>I think people are more excited to see Google Maps on iOS more than the release of the iPhone 5.</p>
<p>+10000000</p>
<p>^ Fanboy</p>
<p>sorry but i  would switch to wp8 when it comes in an unlocked phone.  I dont carry a fan with me nor do i hand fans to people that sell them.  Dont knwo what youre talkgin about.</p>
<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/BFnJ+" /></p>
<p>in Canada&#8230;. wut?</p>
<p>Move that closer to a major city like Toronto and you&#8217;ll see Traffic and Transit info.</p>
<p>I believe this is a non issue to many on this post, LOL.</p>
<p>Finally ! <br />
It&#8217;s not design for iPad but I don&#8217;t care anymore ! Download NOW !!!</p>
<p>Google Maps on iOS is trending on Twitter..craziness</p>
<p>Wow, the number of comments&#8230; you guys really had an issue with the maps app that badly? Thank goodness I live in an area unaffected by this &#8220;huge mistake&#8221; (as far as I know). Congratulations to those getting the experience they want and deserve. Without outcry no changes will come, thanks for demanding more.</p>
<p>Actually a large chunk of the comments are taken up by Android fanboys wanting their 15 minutes of fame which they surely will not find in any Android app article.</p>
<p>Not really&#8230;</p>
<p>I would believe that not nearly as many people were grieved by this Maps as it has made out to be. I say that because I hear it from non-owner sources: Android users, news outlets, and others. However, the people (myself included) that use their phone on a daily basis have never encountered a problem where they went &#8220;Ah damn Apple Maps!&#8221;</p>
<p>Granted, where I live doesn&#8217;t rely on mass transit, and I am sure those people in NY/CA are feeling it more. However large those places are (well, dense I suppose), that&#8217;s not ALL of the US nor all of the world. I&#8217;m willing to bed the number of people who are actually bothered by it is quite small and only getting smaller. Seems like it became some sensation and running joke than a real widespread problem. Yes, I understand it affects everyone, but not everyone the same.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re just jealous of the new iOS maps and gmail. LOL so much better than the Android version.</p>
<p>They have the two finger tilt axis backwards&#8230;really weird.</p>
<p>You can tilt with two fingers.</p>
<p>Sorry, the performance is disastrous on an iPod touch 4G. I know it&#8217;s not the fastest device, but it&#8217;s far from the fluidness of the iOS 5 app. Hope it will improve soon, cause the data is miles better than Apple Maps solution.</p>
<p>Performance isn&#8217;t great on an iPhone 5 either. Google have got some serious optimising to do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really well done. Great job, Google.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as smooth as Apple&#8217;s vector map implementation — it seems to be about half the frame rate of Apple Maps on iPhone 5, but that&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>On iPhone 4 it is <em>very</em> stuttery.</p>
<p>Not that keen on the vertical &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; buttons that bring up action sheet views. They look more like grippy drag handles, not an ellipsis.</p>
<p>Those are minor issues though, a very impressive app otherwise.</p>
<p>Yeah, browsing/zooming/rotating maps on an iPhone 4 in Google Maps definitely stutters.</p>
<p>Its been tested with iOS SDK tool, its getting almost half the FPS as Apple maps. And I could tell right away :(<br />

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dQTLD.png" /></p>
<p>This was the only must have I had left on Android. Nothing&#8217;s holding me back from buying a Googlefied iPhone now.</p>
<p>It ain&#8217;t any better than iMaps. This thing says my work building is in the wrong place.  And a giant warehouse next door is supposed to be Payless Shoes.   The welding station next door is supposed to be a Family Dollar?  ahahaha.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad this is an improvement for some of you, but it&#8217;s no less of a joke than the other one on my iPhone.</p>
<p>whatever dude, go back to your Yahoo maps.</p>
<p>Past your bedtime?   Touchy much?  There&#8217;s several blocks near downtown not even on the map.  I&#8217;ve been sending Google error reports for YEARS and they don&#8217;t fix anything.  I think they are good in bigger cities, but in rural areas, you&#8217;re better off stopping at the laundromat asking for directions.</p>
<p>You know you can fix them yourself?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. You just have to move to Sunnyvale, CA, get a job at Google, work your way into the mapping division, and then make the change.</p>
<p>Simple.</p>
<p>Okay, I&#8217;ve been using this app for a good length of time, and I have to say Google is really making gorgeous, well designed apps. I don&#8217;t know if Matias Duarte is the reason Google has stepped up their software design in the last year or so, but whatever the reason, I&#8217;m very glad it happened. Looking at Google&#8217;s iOS apps, and some of it&#8217;s Android apps (Google Now/Voice Search, Google+, etc), I can&#8217;t wait to see what the next major version of Android will be like.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t assume that it&#8217;s the work of one person. There are many people that work on the UI and you&#8217;re discounting their work by pinning directly onto one person.</p>
<p>Downloaded and installed. Looks and works great! Patience everyone, it&#8217;s being rolled oud slowly on App Store.</p>
<p>Samsung just got burned by Google, so much for the map attack ads by Samsung and 24 hours later Google maps in the appstore.</p>
<p>Yeah, they really must be crying right about now.</p>
<p>Samsung had maps ads?</p>
<p>Google: Designing and building better apps for their competitors platform than their own.</p>
<p>Not really, but if it makes you happy, go ahead and feel that way</p>
<p>But, but&#8230;.The Verge said&#8230;.</p>
<p>As someone who has championed Apple Maps from the beginning (I really do like it), this is clearly a better offering. I prefer the polish on Apple&#8217;s version (feels more native), but Google has them beat handily on features.</p>
<p>How so? They&#8217;re pretty much on par feature wise. Ignoring integration and background capability; which is pretty important for navigation.</p>
<p>Google has transit directions, Apple has yelp (here in the US yelp listings are better than Zagat 95% of the time) a few trade off here and there both ways depending on what you want out of your maps app, but I&#8217;d hardly say it &#8220;clearly is better&#8221;.</p>
<p>I disagree with the yelp statement</p>
<p>Perhaps the differences are geographic. Zagat has been pretty irrelevant for a while though. At least in comparison to yelp, foursquare or even FB</p>
<p>I just find that yelp has almost too many reviews. Sure yelp reviews everything and anything and will have 1000 reviews per any given place but I actually like a smaller community where I can actually trust the reviews. I mean do I really need a review for every Denny&#8217;s? Not really. There&#8217;s just a lot of junk to sort through with yelp. But like you said could be location based. (I am in the us)</p>
<p>Since when is more data a negative?<br />
You don&#8217;t need reviews for every Denny&#8217;s; but you&#8217;re also not surfing Yelp reading every listing like a newspaper article&#8230;at least I hope not.<br />
In many things a smaller community is better. In something like a ratings system for businesses, more is always better.</p>
<p>Nokia is so far behind on mapping in the US.  Their POI is not so hot.  Microsoft need to take a vested interest in making mapping better on Windows Phone.</p>
<p>I can only wish for Google Maps on WP. It may take years.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll get right on it when they stop bleeding money.</p>
<p>Well MS needs to get in there and fix the problem.  Bing mapping might have better data right now then Nokia.  They did promise Nokia Maps on all phones but that won&#8217;t cut it.  It has to be a join venture to make any type of impression.</p>
<p>Right now Nokia maps is like Google maps from 2009.</p>
<p>I gave Nokia&#8217;s app a chance but now with Google Maps being out it&#8217;s time for it to go.</p>
<p>There already is a Google Maps App (not from Google)</p>
<p>I tried it but its OK.  Maybe a little better than Nokia Maps.  But nothing compares to full native app support.</p>
<p>Works fine on 4GLTE &#8212; quick pop-up. i&#8217;m on AT&amp;T in Dallas with the iP5 and could&#8217;t be happier. I run a hair salon and clients ALWAYS ask how to get to my salon. I ask them for their address, then back things up. it works.</p>
<p>It certainly suffers performance issues on my iPod Touch 4th gen. No complaints, but this is a case where Google Maps runs faster on my Android.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s your phone? Because the 4th gen touch is two year old hardware that was lacking in RAM even then.</p>
<p>Comparing maps on note2 vs ipad 3. There isnt any significant difference between the 2 regarding speed. In fact scrolling is smoother on the note2. Theverge again is heavy on the hyperbole<br />
the ability to access navigation seems to be better on ios</p>
<p>Funny how this &#8220;focus on content&#8221; and &#8220;do away with all interface elements&#8221; thing is what we used to describe Apple a few years back.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have the chance to try this out yet (I only have iPad), but it looks really really nice.</p>
<p>The lack of offline maps and iPad compatibility means I still don&#8217;t have a single full-featured maps solution.</p>
<p>Hopefully Google updates this sooner than later.</p>
<p> I was wondering if Apple could improve Maps and Siri before Google Maps hit the apps store. But I don&#8217;t think anyone except people like us that read tech news will bother to download it.</p>
<p>I think you are very wring a lot of non techies have heard about the maps debacle and now google will be in the headlines and #1 in the app store many people will download it. The apple maps problems were internationally documented. Late night shows made fun of it. And now Google maps will be in the news. Tons of regular folks will have this downloaded by the end of the week. And its trending on twitter</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda funny how Google never gets this amount of attention when it comes to Android-related stuff.</p>
<p>No one care about second place*.</p>
<p>I know its not really second place anymore but thats the narrative in most peoples heads and its really hard to break a narrative.</p>
<p>It still won&#8217;t be used more than the default maps app.</p>
<p>Apple just had its ass handed to it by Google, again.</p>
<p>one thing i don&#8217;t get is why can&#8217;t maps on iOS show the direction you are facing with an arrow head like google map on Android. Is that a design choice?</p>
<p>Ok&#8230;I&#8217;m just thinking the Apple Maps fiasco caused a big uproar and probably overshadowed the iPhone 5 release.  In addition caused Apple to apologize for the first time in&#8230;well forever..and resulted a huge shake up within the higher ups. I think all of that might make Google Maps on iOS one of the biggest tech stories of 2012&#8230;just my thoughts</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kinda creepy how you&#8217;re so invested in how much attention one iOS app is getting.</p>
<p>Not sure how that is related to my comment</p>
<p>Woo!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t download though. Stupid servers.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really important to understand the entire picture. While yes, everyone wants to focus on Apple&#8217;s Maps and how subpar they are compared to Google&#8217;s previous offerings or their newer, stellar app, let&#8217;s not forget one thing &#8212; Apple accelerated this.</p>
<p>Apple wanted turn-by-turn for a long time but Google would NOT give it to them. Google wanted more data from users, Apple wouldn&#8217;t give it to them. There was an impasse here and neither side would relent. So Apple said, you know what&#8230; we don&#8217;t need you Google, we&#8217;ll do our own. Sure it will be painful at first, and people will bitch and moan (and they did), but the end product will be worth it.</p>
<p>Google lost a lot of people using the native app for Maps when iOS rolled its own. Not everyone hated Apple&#8217;s Maps, I would venture to say a lot of people in the US didn&#8217;t mind the slight inconveniences they had. Google knew they would have to make a Maps app, they know they are only valuable as long as they are omni-present. So they did, and what do we have here? Apple got their rival&#8217;s turn-by-turn for free. They got awesome Maps, for free. Instead of HAVING to give user data to Google, it&#8217;s an opt-in (whatever the app itself collects) and limited by the OS.</p>
<p>So as much as you all want to say, LOL GOOGLE PWNS APPLE, this quality of an application more than likely would not have come to iOS without this big of a push from Apple. Definitely not turn-by-turn for sure.</p>
<p>I agree with most of your points but I actually think if Google maps were separate from the os from the beginning turn by turn would of been there earlier. Apps desperate from the os are just better and updated way more frequently. Who really knows but I really do think Google wants their products equally great and feature rich on all relevant os&#8217;s .</p>
<p>Google was holding out on Apple because they THOUGHT Apple wouldn&#8217;t dare try to roll their own and Google does have one of the best (if not THE best) maps out there. So it was used as a bargaining chip and Apple figured it was time to be more future-focused (vector maps &gt; tile based maps) and an API to boot.</p>
<p>Now Apple has Google giving them their best work for practically nothing because Google HAS to be on iOS to keep that userbase.</p>
<p>So firing one of their execs and having back lash from former employees was part of the plan? Think you&#8217;re giving too much credit.</p>
<p>Forstall&#8217;s leave was more than likely due to his attitude rather then the projects he managed. Siri was not a failure, it was a huge selling point for the 4S and a lot of people bought it for that (your opinion aside, that is reality).</p>
<p>Maps was (and still is) a work in progress. Apple knew it would be and perhaps they should have branded it as such more. But that is Apple I suppose, it&#8217;s not rare for them to launch software half-baked (see: Final Cut Pro X), iTunes 11, etc. While it is easy to fault Maps for it&#8217;s database issues, it does have notable merits. Vector maps are superior in rendering, zooming, and data usage compared to tile maps. Having an API that developers can tie into is also another. Turn by turn is what Apple needed to keep their maps functionality up to date. The actual database could still use some work but Apple is not standing still there.</p>
<p>The problem with Apple&#8217;s Maps is that they should have done it a year ago and that way it&#8217;d be much more mature now. I&#8217;m not saying Apple&#8217;s plan to get a good Maps app was this, but this is definitely a side effect of a competitive market.</p>
<p>OK I see your point.</p>
<p>Functions and looks fantastic on my iPhone 4S. <br />
Well done Google. <br />
I have shelved the Apple Maps app alongside Stocks.app, Weather.app, etc.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s iOS/web design language is definitely mature and beautiful now. I personally prefer this design language over Apple&#8217;s, Microsoft&#8217;s, Android&#8217;s, and anything else out there. It makes Apple&#8217;s built-in apps, with their gradient headers and skeuomorph switches/buttons look absolutely dated. I can&#8217;t wait to see them apply these learnings to the Android OS.</p>
<p>Yeah, the skeuomorphic elements in maps really irks me</p>
<p>Everybody wins.</p>
<p>Except the Apple Maps guys.</p>
<p>Even those get some pressure off their backs.</p>
<p>I was always saying it was best for google to redo it&#8217;s YouTube and Maps apps themselves for iOS and have it as an app store app so it gets updated more than once a year and has the freedom google wants that apple doesn&#8217;t want them to have in terms of branding.</p>
<p>Google saves Apple yet again.</p>
<p>Google saves Google, again.</p>
<p>Engadgets hand on gives a better impression.  Good read <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/13/google-maps-for-ios-hands-on/">http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/13/google-maps-for-ios-hands-on/</a></p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t the Android version look that good? I can&#8217;t wait for Key Lime Pie when we get the Google Now/Google+ interface everywhere. That is such a beautiful exercise in design. Simple, yet more than effective.</p>
<p>Playing around with it now&#8230;<br />
It definitely isn&#8217;t smoother than Apple maps. I do like how much easier it is to find places.</p>
<p>One thing i didn&#8217;t find in the new Google Maps for iOS is that if you choose to go by trains or buses, it&#8217;ll only show you the route, but not step by step guide on the map, just a text based one.<br />
Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m the only one have this problem.</p>
<blockquote>how data and design<strong> beat</strong> Apple</blockquote>
<p>Wow! There&#8217;s something you don&#8217;t hear everyday.</p>
<p>Google maps looks good but in no way it beats Apple maps design. Data &#8211; hands down but design, not quite. It&#8217;s close though.</p>
<p>P.S &#8211; I hate Google app&#8217;s icons. Their app designs are so much better now but the icons are still shitty. Hate chrome, gmail, maps icons.</p>
<p>Oooookay. I&#8217;m gonna assume Apple&#8217;s designs beats everything in your opinion? To be honest, even when I liked the iOS, I hated the default UI.</p>
<p>Wow, it makes the Android Google Maps look like crap. (hey, I said &#8220;look&#8221;, so no hate please). Hopefully the next Android Maps update looks like this.</p>
<p>It actually takes so many cues from Google Now that it makes me suspect this is the &#8220;new&#8221; Google design language that is also going to make  its way on Android system-wide come Key Lime Pie(it is essentially Holo Light, right?)</p>
<p>Good job!</p>
<p>Has anyone tried accelerometer -helped street view?  It is the most awesomest and smoothest implementation of the feature that I&#8217;ve seen anywhere.</p>
<p>Really glad Apple took the decision to allow a Google Maps app, for the sake of its users. No doubt Apple will continue to work on their app and won&#8217;t want Google as a competitor on their own platform when it&#8217;s finished. So, could this be a temporary thing?</p>
<p>The days of Apple kicking legitimate apps off iOS are long gone, fortunately. Google Maps will be in the app store for as long as Google wish it to be, which I imagine will be essentially forever.</p>
<p>Fantastic that this is now here, but.. performance is pretty disappointing. I&#8217;m on an iPhone 5, and yet the scrolling is laggy and far from the slick 60 frames per second we got in the old Google Maps app, and now get in the Apple Maps app.</p>
<p>Obviously data is king and so this is now my map app of choice, but I hope Google can make it run better with future updates.</p>
<p>Also, the navigation looks pretty weak. I tried my route to work and it ignored my regular route and instead sent me on terrible route through heavy traffic.  Not so smart.</p>
<p>This is bad for apple maps. One thing apple needs is data from areas that it doesn&#8217;t have. With Google maps now those people will use the better data maps (google) causing a bad chain effect for apple.</p>
<p>soooo&#8230; Apple Maps was heavily criticized for not providing public transportation directions.</p>
<p>now, with Google Maps&#8230; I still can&#8217;t get transit directions&#8230; in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Dude! use the MTA website for more accurate directions!!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for MTA bus/train schedules, I recommend the L.A. Metro Alerts app, or go to NextBus and save it to your homescreen. If you&#8217;re after schedules for other L.A. County bus lines, e.g. Santa Monica, Culver City, Torrance Transit, etc., they&#8217;re not in NextBus as of the last time I checked, so I recommend just going to their websites for the maps and timetables, and downloading whichever schedules you need. That&#8217;s what I did on my iPhone 4 when I had it, and I do it on my G-Nexus now.</p>
<p>Ha ha. This is so good for Google. Now they can have all of the user data which Apple didn&#8217;t want to give in the first place.</p>
<p>All this amazing Google services on iOS makes me realize how much of a badass phone would we have had if Google could have been a partner with Apple on iPhone. I mean I understand why they had to go create a mobile OS but imagine a phone with Apple&#8217;s hardware and even software chops and Google&#8217;s amazing services like gmail, maps, google now.</p>
<p>Sigh. One can dream.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s what would have happened if Google hadn&#8217;t decided to release Android. They&#8217;d probably be making a lot more money from it too.</p>
<p>I just downloaded it. Now all I need is an iOS device to put it on.</p>
<p>Hahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahaha</p>
<p>Must be dumb, I can&#8217;t find Street View..</p>
<p>Took me a while too. Swipe up.</p>
<p>Thanks, but for some reason that didn&#8217;t work either.</p>
<p>Very glad it has arrived. I just wish there were biking directions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that great. What&#8217;s the big deal. It is still better in my GNex.</p>
<p>the UI is going to be implemented for android. if my hypothesis is correct then google is using apple user as their laboratory lab, to check whether the user likes the UI, does it need anymore improvements and is it stable</p>
<p>Works great, but basically what happened was Apple wanted turn-by-turn, Google said PAY UP! with cash and more user info, Apple said NOPE! Then Apple went and spent billions to make its own Maps, and failed pretty hard&#8230;.and Google eventually put maps on the iphone with all the great features anyway now without the money or user info&#8230;SSssssOOOOOooo nobody wins. Even the user lost out on a better unified experience. Tech politics is stupid.</p>
<p>to the Asgard!</p>
<p>NOW THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT! My hats off to everyone at Google today they make a great achievement and seriously show everyone else how its done! <strong>applause</strong></p>
<p>So&#8230; no offline mode, still &#8216;the best map option on ANY smartphone&#8217; ?<br />
Meh</p>
<p>Different opinions by different tech sites. Engadget claims it&#8217;s still not as good as Android&#8217;s. The Verge says it&#8217;s better on iPhone. Yet from my experience so far I&#8217;m gonna have to side with the former&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lltzgnHi5F1qzib3wo1_400.jpg" /><img src="http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lltzgnHi5F1qzib3wo1_400.jpg" /></p>
<p>Overall, this is a pretty good offering. For me, it won&#8217;t replace the default app for general use, but it will stay loaded for some special use cases. Everything below is based on use cases for an iPhone 5 in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>Pros:<br />
- The location data is unquestionably the best around. Google&#8217;s invested a lot in its mapping, and it shows.<br />
- The vector tiles are a huge improvement over the previous (iOS 5) maps app.<br />
- The overall design is clean and (mostly) consistant with Google&#8217;s other recent offerings like Gmail, Google+, etc. Some of the language differs from Google&#8217;s other offerings (two finger swipe to open the menu, for example).<br />
- Streetview. Enough said. Regardless of your view of the mapping data and how it works in your location, no one else is even close to being able to offer this.<br />
- Voice navigation is a welcome addition. The voice is clean, and easily understood. Will likely sound more natural than Siri to most users, at least, it does to me.<br />
- Traffic data is superior to Apple&#8217;s maps thus far, in limited use.</p>
<p>Cons<br />
- Biggest issue for me: no ability to integrate with Siri. I don&#8217;t use Siri for much, but for navigation while driving, it&#8217;s a godsend of a feature. Not being able to voice navigate handsfree while driving makes this a non-starter for me when compared to Apple&#8217;s app.<br />
- The performance on my iPhone 5 is unquestionably slower than the default maps app over the same WIFI network. Over LTE, I have the same experience. I suspect this is simply an issue of Google having more data to push to the user.<br />
- The design language is inconsistant. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t use the proper language for iOS (such as when trying to share a destination, which should normally bring up a list of ways to share in a default window), but sometimes it simply doesn&#8217;t work the same way Google&#8217;s other offerings do. The menu is on the right instead of the left. The button to open menu options is at the bottom right instead of the top left. Etc.<br />
- Obviously, it cannot be used as the default app. This isn&#8217;t really a ding against Google&#8217;s implementation so much as it&#8217;s a problem with the inability to specify different default apps in iOS.<br />
- The sharing options are extremely limited. Locations can only be shared to message, mail or clipboard. Apple maps aren&#8217;t much better, but do also include twitter and facebook as default options.<br />
- Yelp&#8217;s location reviews are vastly superior to Zaggat in my area (US, San Diego). Your mileage may vary.<br />
- Shake to send feedback is on by default. I&#8217;m not sure who thinks that&#8217;s a good idea in an app that will be open while attached to a car while driving. You should turn this off no matter what if you use Google Maps.<br />
- No night mode. Why both Apple and Google are both missing this is <em>beyond</em> comprehension. It&#8217;s like no one at either of these companies has ever driven with their phone on at night. Bright white screen + car dashboard + driver field of view = crazy.</p>
<p>Good point on night mode. It&#8217;s infuriating nobody implements it. Although you could get a little bit of it by reversing the screen white on black.</p>
<p>Hmm. In the Android-version it&#8217;s quite dark by default. This is how it looks (and when there is no instruction the screen will actually dim automatically, so it&#8217;s even darker then).<img src="http://i.imgur.com/mEzQp.png" /></p>
<p>Actually Android is light during the day and then switches to this darker view at night. I deliver pizzas and use Google Navigation all the time on my Android phone so I know this is true. It actually will make the transition from light to dark while in use if you happen to be using it at the right time.</p>
<p>Oh, didn&#8217;t know. Nice feature!</p>
<p>this has been standard on GPS&#8217;s in general for 10+ years. TomTom 6 (think win mobile 5.5 days) did this for me:D</p>
<p>Yeah that is really a GPS staple,.</p>
<p>ummm not true,  Google Navigation automatically goes into Night Mode.</p>
<p>Dieter &#8220;forgot&#8221; to mention that.</p>
<p>I wonder how many employees at Cupertino have just moved their Apple maps app to a far flung folder away from the home screen, and in its place installed google maps!</p>
<p>Now I feel my iphone 5 is complete. Thanks Google. And that&#8217;s how Maps should be done Apple. Learn from competition instead of suing them.</p>
<p>One of the highlights was that the navigation works when your not in the app, hmm I wonder where that feature came from&#8230;<br />
Bam!<br />
My Nokia lumia 920 has had that feature when nokia drive ever since Iv&#8217;e had the phone.</p>
<blockquote>We didn&#8217;t get a chance to fully see driving navigation, but Graf says that it still works even if you&#8217;re not in the app. Google has utilized the standard iOS &#8220;Local Notification&#8221; feature to provide you with spoken, turn-by-turn directions via a notification even if you&#8217;re on the lock screen or in another app. In fact, Graf told us, Google didn&#8217;t get any special access at all — it&#8217;s a standard iOS app using standard iOS APIs.</blockquote>
<p>This paragraph was written in something of a surprised tone, which I find odd, because satellite navigation apps have been running in the background since iOS 4, which came out in June 2010.</p>
<p>For anyone who&#8217;s counting, that was before Windows Phone 7 was even released, never mind the Lumia 920.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s that, a week?</p>
<p>Yeah I&#8217;m sure Google copied that feature from Nokia.</p>
<p>/facepalm</p>
<p>It may not be as fast/fluid as Apple Maps, but there is NO denying Google Maps for iOS is much better. Arguably even nicer than on Android.</p>
<p>So has anyone figured out street view? wait, is that even possible with the app?!</p>
<p>swipe up</p>
<p>Currently testing maps on my wife&#8217;s iPhone 5 right now. I won&#8217;t lie, Dieter might be right about it being slightly better than on my Nex4. I&#8217;d expect an update to the nex4 though.</p>
<p>with Google Maps out now, there is even more compelling reasons to switch to the iPhone.</p>
<p>Maybe, but not that many people had huge issues with Apple Maps in the first place.  In addition Android users are not on Android solely for Maps.  Android Fans just used the mapping differences to start arguments with Apple Fan Boys.</p>
<p>Wow Google did a good Job</p>
<p>Looks good, but I&#8217;m one of the folks who put off updating to ios6. Still not sure if I should. I use Waze for turn by turn</p>
<p>What reason is there to <strong>not</strong> upgrade? Waze will still work, you&#8217;ll have the new stuff like Passbook and a better version of Google Maps  &#8212; win / win, no?</p>
<p>I am on iPhone 4 and it feels sluggish :(</p>
<p>Yeah, same here. Hopefully future updates will fix this since Apple maps runs smooth on the iPhone 4.</p>
<p>Ohh look I get voice turn by turn on Google Maps on my iphone 4, something the trash that is apple maps supposedly cannot do.</p>
<p>The entire app performs like garbage on the iPhone 4 though.  Why would Apple release an app that can barely function? Exactly. They don&#8217;t.  Now you know why? Just because it can be done, doesn&#8217;t mean it should.  With great power&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say Design beat Apple.  Data, yes, but the clean UI, vector tiles and lack of advertising was a direct take from Apple&#8217;s play book.  And I&#8217;d go further to say that if Apple is beaten, which is a very early call, then it was Google&#8217;s years long head start that did it.  Apple is still collecting rudimentary data.</p>
<p>It is kind of hard to collect enough data to catch up, when a significant amount of your users are moving to a different mapping app.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a bad first attempt, but the pitch/yaw has a very limited angle compared to Apple&#8217;s Map&#8217;s app and bizarrely Google have inverted the direction to pitch up/down which is baffling. On the Apple app I can tilt the camera to see much further into the distance. Also Google&#8217;s app doesn&#8217;t appear to be displaying terrain in 3D like Apple&#8217;s map where you can see hills and slopes very clearly. I don&#8217;t really want to have to switch to Google Earth for that. Mount Everest looks a lot more impressive when it&#8217;s not flat! ;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s wrong with the Verge&#8217;s iPhone 5, but on mine Apple&#8217;s Maps are much, much smoother. Also the omni-present search box on Google Maps is very intrusive and much less minimalist compared to the search box on Apple&#8217;s app. And of course there&#8217;s no 3D flyover in Google&#8217;s App yet.</p>
<p>Certainly I&#8217;ll be accused of being a blinkered fanboy for not immediately singing Google Maps&#8217; praises, but for me Apple&#8217;s maps app still does more of what I want that Google&#8217;s app. The one redeeming feature for Google is StreetView which I do find very useful and Apple would be wise to find a way to get proper feature parity on that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about the data. Deal with it.</p>
<p>I agree. Apple&#8217;s design is nicer, but yes, Google still has the best map data set and search results.</p>
<p>Great! Now when I search for Hyde Park I&#8217;ll no longer be taken to somewhere in Sydney (I live in London and my iPhone should really know that by now).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got the double tap zoom, nice, seem way more intuitive for single handed operation!</p>
<p>The data set is clearly better, but no third party transit info means no transit info at all for me &#8230; and the app itself is not particularly optimized, smooth or intuitive. It feels like a web-view (the actuall web version feels faster) and pisses all over iOS interface guidelines. The choice is nice i guess, but I&#8217;m not switching to it just yet.</p>
<p>iOS 6 here I come!!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for the Android update :)</p>
<p>The verge has to give it to apple, even in this situation they have the balls to say that gmaps on ios is better than on android&#8230; it is getting tiresome to see then lickng apple&#8230;</p>
<p>So far pretty much all reviews are saying the same. live with it.</p>
<p>like who&#8217;s  Engadget had said google has left most of the premium features on Android</p>
<p>there is no off line<br />
no bicyle<br />
limited layers<br />
no might mode<br />
no customizable direction field.</p>
<p>Dieter was prehaps a little too giddy at first before digging in .</p>
<p>Sweet, and I just bought my iPhone 5 on monday and don&#8217;t ever have to use apples offering!</p>
<p>You should give it a shot. It&#8217;s actually a lot nicer than Google&#8217;d offering in several ways, despite it&#8217;s lackluster search results.</p>
<p>&#8220;This map is wrong, but it&#8217;s prettier!&#8221;</p>
<p>with this Google Maps, Apple&#8217;s losing it.</p>
<p>No, not really. The Google Maps app is nothing special, honestly. I don&#8217;t see how you concluded that Apple is &#8220;losing it&#8221;.</p>
<p>And, honestly, I urge all iPhone users to opt-out of sending anonymous location data back to Google so they can&#8217;t use any of it for Mapping data (given their horrible privacy violations that they&#8217;ve used to build up their data initially).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say that Apple is winning it for being the platform with the best version of Google Maps!</p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;m one of the few who actually prefer Apple Maps.  I think the interface and design is better and more intuitive.  Not to mention as someone who travels everyday and relies on Maps I&#8217;ve yet to get lost or have issues.  In fact Apple Maps have saved me time on several of my regular trips, which I have the routes memorized on by showing me shorter routes.</p>
<p>We just moved from Oklahoma to Tennessee and used Apple Maps the whole way without issue.  Since neither my wife or I know this area we use Apple Maps a lot to navigate to places around town and we&#8217;ve yet to have issues.</p>
<p>I agree, I also tend to like the new Apple Maps. The app itself is great. However, I did notice inaccurate data here and there, which did bug me, however I still much prefer its functionality over the old maps app. I especially love turn by turn navigation and in fact I use it exclusively now instead of relying on a dedicated navigation app, which cost me 79 bucks once.</p>
<p>As for the new Google Maps app, I haven&#8217;t tried it, yet. However, I&#8217;m finding it a bit curious to claim it to be the best designed maps app on any platform while saying that it might not be immediately intuitive in the same article.</p>
<p>You are not alone.</p>
<p>Same here and I&#8217;m actually pretty disappointed after getting hyped up by this article. My first thought was &#8220;this&#8230;is&#8230;laggy&#8221; It&#8217;s not like we didn&#8217;t have alternative map apps, we already had the Nokia and Waze maps on my iOS devices.</p>
<p>Do Google Maps/Navigation/Place Search work offline?</p>
<p>Not available in Turkish App Store, sigh&#8230;</p>
<p>Laggy on iPhone 4.</p>
<p>Transit information not working in all areas.  Prior to Apple Maps the old Google Map provided me with transit info. Not sure why it isn&#8217;t working my region any more</p>
<p>Works better than Android xD</p>
<p>when is apple going to release maps for android devices?</p>
<p>apple fans/users desperate for a google app? that says something about how shit ios6 maps are</p>
<p>Sorry, have you been asleep for the past few months? That&#8217;s the whole point&#8230;</p>
<p>Praise Jesus!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still not Waze.</p>
<p>good on google for getting this out. Not that the iOS version before was that great, but I bet they lost a lot of future data with the move on apple maps.</p>
<p>Personally I don&#8217;t really care for maps on my phone. I&#8217;d still rather use a dedicated gps. Even if those aren&#8217;t as up to date. When I&#8217;m driving I need my phone to be open as a phone. Walking around a city, this is great though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Google Maps for iOS is the best-designed maps app on any platform and challenges even Google Maps on Android for speed. That sounds like hyperbole, but on the iPhone 5 the new Google Maps app seems faster and is definitely better-designed than even Google Maps on Android.&#8221; Discuss this..  ALL comments should be focusing on this paragraph and nothing more.. Ill start.. Why google?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s just me, but Dieter looks so hurry using the app that make me uncomfortable watching the video. App looks good, but I really want to see a calmly hands on, not this. D:</p>
<p>The best part of Google Maps on iOS is that I won&#8217;t have to hear the tech pundits whine about the lack of Google maps on iOS.  I&#8217;m definitely not grooving with the 2x version on the iPad and with the exception of playing with Street View on a rare occasion, I don&#8217;t see much reason to use this app over the native Apple map, and Waze is much more useful for navigation.</p>
<p>A few months ago, iOS didn&#8217;t really have good, free turn-by-turn navigation options. Now, iOS has many good offerings (Apple Maps, Google Maps, Nokia, etc). I&#8217;ll probably be using Google Maps more (initial searches work better), but Apple turn-by-turn navigation has served me well on the iPhone and iPad in recent weeks. Because of Apple&#8217;s aggressive moves, iOS users now have a better map experience overall&#8230; That will help them keep selling iOS devices, which is the end goal here</p>
<p>Sorry, I know that Verge (and the rest of the tech blogs) are clearly biased toward Google but this app is far from the best&#8230; it&#8217;s just&#8230; &#8216;meh&#8217;.</p>
<p>The design is nice but limited and the fact that you can&#8217;t initiate navigation by Siri, save recent places, or search by nearby stores is a serious limitation.</p>
<p>If you think this is the best then that&#8217;s just pretty sad and you&#8217;re obviously struck by your Google blinders; I&#8217;ll stick to iOS maps and Waze, thank you very much.</p>
<p>Maybe, in time, Google Maps will get there but this version clearly misses the mark into making the app &#8220;something special&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s meh is iOS6.</p>
<p>How so? If you mean the maps, I&#8217;m not sure how you can say that &#8211; the turn by turn is much nicer then Google&#8217;s version (though I prefer Waze) and you can control everything by Siri.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking about iOS6, in general, well then you can&#8217;t just say that and not back anything up about why you feel that way&#8230;. considering it&#8217;s just an operating system.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s quite funny, I don&#8217;t think anyone would ever claim that The Verge and other tech sites favor Google over Apple.  that is quite laughable.  In fact it&#8217;s the opposite  Apple has always been the darling of the Verge Staff and most tech sites like BGR, AllThingsD etc.</p>
<p>Just look at this piece, even when priased Google&#8217;s efforts he still can&#8217;t help but throw in an iPhone is better  message claiming that the iPhone version is better than the Android version</p>
<p>And while I&#8217;m sure Google Maps is certainly the best Mapping and navigation option on iOS   there are few important distinctions that Dieter left out when proclaiming the iOS version as KING of ALL PLATFORMS</p>
<p>such as  <br />
&quot; It&#8217;s not iPad-optimized, for one. Layers are limited largely to satellite and traffic data, without extras like bicycling or terrain. You can&#8217;t quickly browse through local attractions without starting a search, or cache maps for offline use. Turn-by-turn navigation doesn&#8217;t provide a night mode, customizable map layers or manually specified rerouting. &#8217;</p>
<p>The Android version is still more featured rich and more intergrated into the UI and OS  so for someone who is a Google fan boy don&#8217;t you think Dieter would have included those points?</p>
<p>So please  to Dieter  iOS is still the Apple of his eye.</p>
<p>Just tried it on a iPad the UI is bad, its slow, and it incessantly keeps bugging you to signup for Google services at every turn not a good user experience (nagware).</p>
<p>Your comment makes zero sense. The Android version is not optimized for the iPad either and yet you are using that as an example of how the iOS version is supposedly inferior.</p>
<p>Welcome back to iOS google.  We were lost without you.</p>
<p>Yes, I too am glad that Google found its way back us.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter, still can&#8217;t change default app links.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s map program works fine where I live. I have already stopped using all the other Google services, so there is no reason at all to bother with their maps.</p>
<p>Um&#8230;? The only reason why the iOS version would need to swipe anywhere is because they don&#8217;t have a menu button. Android version has a semi-transparent menu button on the bottom. We don&#8217;t need to swipe anywhere.</p>
<p>The person talks in the background? The person also talks in the background on Android. Just tested it. =.P</p>
<p>So now it just comes down to features. Of course Android would win. No need to point out the added features.</p>
<p>And the only reason why it would be &#8220;faster&#8221; is the way the app is made. If two apps at perfect creation was made on both Android and iOS, the iOS version would run faster. That&#8217;s just going to happen, a perk of iOS. It&#8217;s the way the app has to be made.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see this version as &#8220;better&#8221;. I would not want that. LoL!! There is too much &#8220;stuff&#8221; missing. The main thing I&#8217;m jealous of is the ability to have different directions instead of one set direction. I&#8217;m jealous. I want that. I hate having to study the map to avoid reroute from the freeway. LoL!!</p>
<p>I used it on my way to work this morning on my iPhone 4.  It worked brilliantly well.  Voice over was awesome, the voice quality was great.  It worked awesome when I was out-of-app.  My bizarre route to work was listed as a possible route (extra bonus).  The few turns it wanted me to take, but I did not want to take were re-routed perfectly.  And, when I got to work the app turned itself off automatically to save on battery life.</p>
<p>Stellar Job Google!!!</p>
<p>Sounds just like Apple Maps.</p>
<p>I would love to hear the sound of Apple Maps on my iPhone 4, believe me.  But for some reason Apple decided to mute it for stubborn users like me still on ancient 2 yo technology.</p>
<blockquote>and quite frankly the best-looking mobile maps experience on the market today</blockquote>
<p>where can i find verges other mapsw reviews from other vendors?</p>
<blockquote>It may not be immediately intuitive to everybody</blockquote>
<p>So why is it supposed to beat Apple Maps on design then?</p>
<blockquote>Where Android&#8217;s Google maps experience has no fewer than three different options menus visible on the main screen,</blockquote>
<p>what do you have against options? I&#8217;m not some grandmother who get flustered if there are more than 2 buttons. Give me the options easily accecible and I&#8217;ll figure out what I want, how about that?</p>
<p>and FYI; those (4 actually) options are Settings, Layers, Local/POI) and navigation. I don&#8217;t see a problem with them being there, rather than behind some obscure swipe menu</p>
<p>Nice but next time please fix your lighting when doing a video. You can&#8217;t see much here because of all the glare.</p>
<p>Apple spent a lot of money to make Google do your work, your own map application for ios. Everyone at Apple must be happy with this situation, because the App Store has great options now.</p>
<p>Now how is &#8220;faster&#8221;  I would ask? It is a huge step backwards in terms of frame rate, responsiveness, control and aesthetics from Apple maps, at least on older phones like iPhone 4. Frame rate never gets above 5-10fps, where Apple maps gives 30+ constantly, regardless of location complexity.</p>
<p>Google maps like Nokia maps UI and speed wise are not a good experience in iOS, however most Geeks and tech pundits will excuse it. (is nagware the future?)</p>
<p>I did find a MAJOR FLAW in the app.</p>
<p>I dropped my son off at school this morning and entered my work address. The app offered three different routes to take. I selected one of them with the intention of seeing what would happen if I chose a different route while driving, a manual reroute.</p>
<p>The app stubbornly tried to get me to go back to the route I had selected, even when I was less than 2,000 feet from my destination using a different route. It wanted to take me FIVE MILES away from where I was to get to back to the original route I chose that was way out of the way. Instead of the app recognizing that the new route was a shorter distance and a more direct route, then offering to reroute me, it continued to tell me <em>&#8216;make a u-turn&#8217; </em>every second it could. It was crazy. If I were somewhere where I was unfamiliar with the territory, this would have been a very bad decision to accept the route&#8230;.the app should &#8216;know better&#8217;.</p>
<p>I think Google needs to take a peek at that and offer an option where it says <em>&#8216;We found a shorter distance, do you want to use it?</em>&#8217; and then I can hit a huge button to accept it or dismiss it and continue on my path.</p>
<p>Street View, oh how I&#8217;ve missed you!</p>
<p>Figuring out public transit when I go into San Francisco just got a whole lot easier! No more trying to use the browser. Now if google could just figure out that the Cal Train hasn&#8217;t stopped at the Atherton station on weekdays since about 2007 it would be even more awesome.</p>
<p>Does a street view appear when you show up at the destination? I was always jealous of that from my android friends.</p>
<p>How&#8217;s it been performing for all the 4S and 5 users?  The scrolling has been pretty laggy on my old 4.</p>
<p>Yet again google gives people another reason to not switch to android.</p>
<p>By making Google Maps on iOS better than Google Maps on Android? Sorry, I fail to see how that will tempt anybody to switch to Android&#8230;</p>
<p>Then again, if you have an Android phone, you&#8217;re kinda used to apps sucking and the best stuff coming out for iPhones first, so App quality can&#8217;t be your first priority.</p>
<p>The only reason I can see for anybody trading in an iPhone for an Android device is:</p>
<p>A: They&#8217;re poor and can&#8217;t afford an iPhone anymore, need something cheaper or&#8230;</p>
<p>B: They hate long battery life, and want an Android phone where the battery runs out after 5-6 hours use.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t question Googles data, but the speed and UI are not particularity good?</p>
<p>Here, have some Haldol, looks like you need it. Visit your doctor first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I said.</p>
<p>Dammit. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve felt iPhone envy but it is starting to creep back up on me.</p>
<p>Give in man! You know it feels good&#8230;<br />
I just dumped my HTC One X and am switching, come along to the dark side!</p>
<p>Nah</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never seen anyone do a two-finger swipe using their middle and ring fingers.  That was weird to watch in the video.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty sleek. My only complaint is that it doesn&#8217;t access your contacts.</p>
<p>Yeah baby. YEAAAAAH!!! <strong>Austin Powers&#8217; voice</strong></p>
<p>haha&#8230;.I just know Google Maps and Navigation is on my Galaxy S2, and ready when I need to use it. Been like that for over three years now.</p>
<p>You could see this iPhone reviewer is really excited and very relieved that he&#8217;s finally got proper maps and navigation on his iphone.</p>
<p>Shame man, I only realize now how deprived these poor iphoners are!</p>
<p>Dieter for sure uses Android. He also used to run a site about webOS, so I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s ever used an iPhone as his primary device. Stop treating your phone choice like a religion.</p>
<p>So now there are TWO great, free mapping apps with navigation on iOS, besides all the paid ones.</p>
<p>Really, why anyone would get anything else than an iPhone is more and more of a mystery.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Android or WP7 phones are fine if you need a cheap feature phone replacement. I&#8217;ve had both HTC OneX and SGSII myself. But there&#8217;s still really only one premium smartphone out there and it still the iPhone.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried Nokia Drive? The fact that you can download navigation maps from virtually any country and use your device as a proper GPS unit is a MAJOR plus that just can&#8217;t be ignored. I recently took a vacation in Jamaica, I pre-installed the Jamaica maps before I left. When I got there I put my phone (L920) in Airplane mode (to not incur any type of charges) and used the Navigation flawlessly.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve tried Nokias Maps on iOS. I don&#8217;t like the layout much, but its an alright map app.</p>
<p>It has the same feature btw, that you can download whatever you want and use it offline. Google Maps can do that too. Nifty feature&#8230;</p>
<p>Actually your iPhone is a feature phone replacement&#8230; Android can do more than iOS ;-)</p>
<p>See&#8230; trolling isn&#8217;t that hard.</p>
<p>If Google can simply give it away for free then why were they charging Apple for it all these years?</p>
<p>While I like Google as a company, this gushing article shocked and horrified me by failing to mention Waze. Waze, as every sauve person knows, is a free piece of software that uses crowdsourcing to both keep their maps uptodate and to tell you where traffic jams, police etc. are on the road whilst it also routes you around these hazards. There is no better software for the job than Waze, and to say that Google is the pinnacle of the technology is to do a diservice to your readers, not to mention naive</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t stand the Waze UI =(</p>
<p>I&#8217;m torn. I&#8217;ll definitely use the new maps app, but after this whole censoring debacle I&#8217;ve also switched to searching with Bing so as to send a message about the inefficiency of their new search algorithm, one which borders on censorship and imposing a moral code on their information. So it&#8217;s an odd feeling. But then again, with a company so omnipresent as Google, it&#8217;s practically impossible to stop using everything they offer.</p>
<p>I know what you mean. The only Google service I use is Reader for RSS syncing.</p>
<p>I know I may be wrong for saying this, but:</p>
<p>This is <em>sad</em> that Google had to fix what Apple couldn&#8217;t. Granted, I have never had a iPhone and therefore never experienced the whole &#8220;iOS6 maps problem&#8221;, but from what I read, it was bad&#8230;really bad.</p>
<p>Did Apple not have a good version of &#8220;Maps&#8221; in iOS5 or something? It seems mind-boggling to me that Google had to fix the simplest problems (tbh, I don&#8217;t get how Apple could have messed up the maps app THAT bad, but <strong>shurgs</strong>).</p>
<p>And now they are saying that the iOS version of Google Maps is better than Android&#8217;s version? I&#8217;m sure Google will release a update to the Android version so both OS&#8217; can be on the same boat.</p>
<p>@VampiricPradaig</p>
<p>I can tell you haven&#8217;t tried it, because they&#8217;re not THAT bad. <br />
(Most of the criticism has probably been from people who haven&#8217;t tried them either)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using them ever since I&#8217;ve upgraded to iOS6 and I haven&#8217;t been lost yet. The built in navigation gets you from A to B, and while I don&#8217;t get as many results when I search for something as in Google Maps, but nine times out of ten I find what I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<p>(Now a lot of this depends on where you live. I&#8217;m in Scandinavia, and the data here is ok. Not great but adequate. As long as you live in Europe or the US, you would probably be fine using only apple Maps. That might not be the case in other parts of the world&#8230;)</p>
<p>Honestly, while there&#8217;s more data in Google Maps, if I had to choose between the old Google maps and Apple Maps with the builtin navigation, 3D maps, etc. I would prefer the Apple Maps.</p>
<p>But now we get one great mapping app (The new Google Maps) and one alright mapping app (Apple Maps) so everyone, users, Apple and Google can be happy!</p>
<p>Google didn&#8217;t &#8220;fix&#8221; anything. Google&#8217;s just had a 6 year head start on mapping and since most mapping issues are fixed via crowd sourcing having been the default map on the most popular smart phone platform for most of those 6 years for the longest time certainly helped Google.</p>
<p>Actually Google did fix Apples huge public relations nightmare. Even the Pro-Apple mainstream press dumped on the screw up from Cupertino. Apple is very lucky to have Google to bail them out.</p>
<p>Bail out of what?</p>
<p>My question now what is the benefit of an iPhone 4S and 5 other than Siri that occasionally works one extra line screen.  My best personal technological decision of the year was not providing iPhone 5.  I see no need to upgrade to future iPhones at the moment.</p>
<p>What you get in iphone5? How about an awesome screen, a faster CPU/GPU than any Android phone and battery life that last all day?</p>
<p>Also the software is much better IMHO.</p>
<p>I got tired of Android for the above reasons, got rid of my SGS2 and HTC OneX and am getting an iPhone 5&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m much in your boat. I have a 4S and I have no pressing need to upgrade to a 5, I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;ll upgrade to the 5S(or whatever it is). Ultimately, the 5 is &#8216;better&#8217; in every respect. From the speakers to the microphones to the radios to the physical dimensions. It is easily twice as fast as a 4S so all your Apps will load almost immediately. But if you don&#8217;t find the 4S to be slow( I don&#8217;t) then it&#8217;s kind of a wash.</p>
<p>If I could think of an analog with the Android world. It&#8217;s a bit like the Galaxy Nexus vs. the Galaxy S3. The G. Nexus is significantly slower on paper, but plenty of people still love it because it is fast &#8216;enough&#8217; to where it doesn&#8217;t feel slow.</p>
<p>Ultimately, for as cool as all of our gadgetry is, there is also a threshold where your own usage does not exceed the limits of the device you are using, even if that device is 2 or 3 or even 5 or 6 years old, at that point, upgrading just isn&#8217;t a priority until something stops working.</p>
<p>meh, no offline function so will wait. Apple Maps has actually been working ok for me.</p>
<p>Me too&#8230; I really think most of the criticism is from Android fanboys who&#8217;ve  never tried Apple Maps.</p>
<p>Is Apple Maps the best mapping App ever? Nope. But it&#8217;s an alright app, and just fine for most people.</p>
<p>The argument is a valid one. Apple maps suck bad. My iPhone 5 is a decent phone, but when one travels for work as I do, Apple maps are useless and dangerous. Google Maps as implemented on my iPhone 4S, are just spectacular. The arrogance of Apple has bit them in the ass again.</p>
<p>Oh, and Siri is actually great on my iPad Mini, and I really prefer a screen between 4 and 4.3 inches&#8230;</p>
<p>My question is: If you are looking up an address in your browser and click it for a map, is the Apple map automatically used and can you set the gmaps app as a default instead? The same question goes for if someone texts you an address. Obviously the way it used to work was any address would automatically open in the google map feature.</p>
<p>If you click a web address to Google Maps iOS simply loads up the mobile web version of Google Maps. It&#8217;s definitely not ideal. Maybe Google will figure out a way to force Google Maps links to launch the app. I believe other apps have this capability.</p>
<p>On my iPhone 4S, the new Google Maps is no faster, and arguably a hair slower than Apple maps, it&#8217;s nothing to really talk about at least the difference is so minor. The maps are obviously more detailed in many ways, but I am a little disappointed my neighborhood as well as the towns bordering it are just as riddled with inaccuracies as they were on Apple&#8217;s maps(again, it&#8217;s kind of a wash because while Google maps get some things right, Apple maps gets others right).</p>
<p>There is no denying that Google maps are overall better in just about every metric, but after all the hoopla and all the hysterics, using the new Google Maps app for a bit and trying to test it to see how it compares directly to Apple&#8217;s Maps the difference is not dramatic. As far as what I need a map to do, the usability is virtually identical, and while I understand a lot of this simply has to do with where I happen to live, I&#8217;m content to know that regardless of which software I choose(and I have other maps apps on my phone as well, mind you) it&#8217;s likely to be just fine. I like maps.</p>
<p>Sorry, but it does have a lot to do where you live. Living in a major metropolitan area, I was hamstrung by Apple&#8217;s Maps. I literally &#8220;hallelujah&#8217;d&#8221; when Google&#8217;s Maps were released today. Since I upgraded to iOS6, it has been nothing but misery. I&#8217;ve downloaded all sorts of band-aid apps to make up the deficiencies. Finally, I can get rid of all the extraneous transit apps, navi apps and POI apps&#8230; I got all I need in one app now. Thank you, Google. You saved my iPhone 4 from complete obsolescence.</p>
<p>Google saves Apples Arse again! <br />
After the rather immature &#8220;I&#8217;m going thermonuclear on Google&#8221; Threat of the departed Steve Jobs, it&#8217;s proof positive that Google is a far classier company that Apple ever was. <br />
I find it positively pathetic of Apple do pull such a stunt as to get rid of Google maps to begin with. <br />
It just goes to show you that Android has Apple paranoid and freaked out.</p>
<p>Your knowledge of technology history isn&#8217;t very deep. Google has done plenty of classless things, as has Apple. For example, Google backtracked on net neutrality, which was egregious. And it undercut web video standards by creating WebM instead of using H264 like everyone else. Google is a great company, but it has its flaws, just like Apple, just like Microsoft, just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Going to an open video format like WebM is not &#8220;classless.&#8221; There&#8217;s plenty of reasons why people should start looking at adopting it rather than H.264. For a long time, Beta was the widely used video format. Doesn&#8217;t mean that it should be.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve missed the point.</p>
<p>So we have another maps app now for iOS.  This is going to come in handy to those who use transit directions a lot (assuming you are in a city where Google has transit coverage).  From a POI search perspective for phone directory lookup, I prefer Google because I already know which listings are stale in Google&#8217;s data in my home town and which are missing (I use Navigon for those).   Apple Maps tripped me up in that regard because if I search for a phone number I am not accustomed to the flaws in Apple&#8217;s POI database.  Mostly Apple Maps has missing stuff while Google Maps has more POI&#8217;s but I encounter stale ones (i.e.: businesses that no longer exist).  Anyway, I now have one more app to lookup POI&#8217;s with, but I think the comment that the &#8220;design&#8221; of this app is superior is slightly mistaken. The design of Apple Maps in iOS 6 has never been the problem &#8212; it has been the data and the fact that it had flaws that users were not already accustomed to.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind that it doesn&#8217;t go to Google maps when I click a contact address because I never do that, but the should at least have bookmarks so when I&#8217;m in the app I can type a friend&#8217;s name and their address will come up. Also needs a satellite/normal hybrid view.</p>
<p>iOS Maps was a total nightmare and the first thing I did in the morning was to install the new Google Maps app. It is fast, usable and good looking. It looks like Google is getting better at designing products.</p>
<p>All I want are amazing Google Apps on my iOS devices &#8211; no Android needed here! BTW this is the 999 comment I win an iPad!!!!!</p>
<p>I am the 1000th comment. What price do I win?</p>
<p>No love for WP?</p>
<p>Google outmaps Apple, world keeps spinning!</p>
<p>Conclusion:<br />
Rather than continuing develop Android that gain nothing except for Samsung, it&#8217;s better to develop good iOS App. Google&#8217;s mobile revenue from iOS is 4x of Android, despite Android install base is 3x iOS.</p>
<p>Verge&#8230;.you have never criticized Google for its USELESS Offline mode, it is very unprofessional. You probably just tested it by turning data/WiFi off on Android and saw &#8220;yep, it works. Now to other things&#8221;. You need to get around and actually use it, do some journalism.</p>
<p>The offline mode on Android is useless because you cannot search the cached location. So for example you cache London because you&#8217;re going there. In London your friend tells you do to go some_street 101, you have no way of finding where that street is unless you&#8217;re going to pan around the entire city, street by street (i.e. impossible). Even then you won&#8217;t get your number.</p>
<p>The only thing that&#8217;s somewhat useful on Offline mode is you know where you are on the map, but you can&#8217;t even receive the address.</p>
<p>Yea but it&#8217;s better than no offline mode at all.</p>
<p>I wonder how this release will affect the development of Apple maps.  Many of the corrections they&#8217;ve made over the last months have been on user feedback, if everyone&#8217;s back using Google Maps what are they gonna do?</p>
<p>I have to mention that the performance of the app (general interface &amp; UI) is pretty bad on an iPhone 4. The article mentions that that this app is well designed in terms of performance, but I have to disagree, things like the sliding menu is really slow and choppy. Pinch/Zooming on the map itself is also slow compared to the native Google Maps app in case of iOS 5.<br />
Although it&#8217;s faster on the iPhone 5, there&#8217;s lots of room for improvement. Google&#8217;s new YouTube app is much better performance wise, for example the sliding menu is a lot faster.</p>
<p>It contains Android code, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>I put the MApple app straight in the folder marked with a &#8216;.&#8217;(a full stop) along with all the other useless apps I cannot delete.</p>
<p>It would appear that the &#8220;split map-and-sheet&#8221; view is only available on the iPhone 5, with its larger screen. I think Google just gave me the first compelling reason to upgrade from my iPhone 4&#8230;</p>
<p>The problem I&#8217;m having with the google maps (which I&#8217;m sure has been mentioned here) is that it&#8217;s not connected to my iPhone contacts. <br />So the fact that I live in the north east where Apple maps has god coverage, I think I will continue to use it. <br />I&#8217;ll probably keep google maps on my phone for street view for now. I do really like the design of the google maps app though.</p>
<p>Oh well… Apple took it a bit too far when they thought they could keep the project in house, become independent from Google and still do well! In fact not just well but beat the competition on a field where G maps has years of experience?!?? I think that’s an excess of corporate confidence. And the truth is that there are a bunch of emerging apps out there that do a great job and yet receive not enough attention! I think these two are some good examples <a href="http://www.mevvy.com/tools/inrix-traffic/" target="_blank">http://www.mevvy.com/tools/inrix-traffic/</a> or <a href="http://www.mevvy.com/tools/waze/in" target="_blank">http://www.mevvy.com/tools/waze/in</a> the end why fuel the giants when we all need business and specially startups???</p>
<p>How does an article about &#8220;maps&#8221; have over 1000 comments? Well, I guess here is another one.</p>
<p>It recalculates your route when you make a wrong turn. Amazing.</p>
<p>Wait Apple maps doesn&#8217;t do that!?!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87EAT3N_f9Y">Apple To Fix Maps by Rearranging Earth&#8217;s Geography</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of seeing Apple fail.</p>
<p>that two finger swipe is kinda a gimmick. just use a layers button!~</p>
<p>Now we only need Google Now for iOS.</p>
<p>I just downloaded it yesterday &amp; for some reason the blue dot that is supposed to pinpoint my location  has never been closer than 50 feet of my actual location. I&#8217;m looking at it right now &amp; it thinks I&#8217;m one block west of my current location. I&#8217;m calling it a draw with Apple maps.</p>
<p>The design is very Apple-y!!!</p>
<p>are you being sarcastic? It&#8217;s nice looking, but the design is not very apple at all. In fact google went out of there way to not use system buttons. Everything is designed to look more google-y.</p>
<p>*their not there. Edit, wherefore art thou?</p>
<p>Edge swipe to menu is Window phone copy right down to the 3 little buttons.</p>
<blockquote>The &#8220;new experience&#8221; is actually a familiar one — the design shares much of the aesthetics of the new Gmail 2.0 app for iOS.</blockquote>
<p>Does that mean it is a shitty web-app like the new Gmail? It doesn´t look very responsive in the video&#8230;</p>
<p>(would try it myself, but no iPad version yet&#8230; pff)</p>
<p>Google maps is way better!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know for you but I only need 1 finger to get to the layers menu.</p>
<p>It is a bit laggy at times on my iPhone 4S as well but I&#8217;m willing to forgive this at the moment given that it is only version 1.0.</p>
<p>I dont know about them beating Apple in design as I think both apps look great. I am very glad to see Google finally paying attention to app design and consistency. Googles app are looking better every day. While I am not a fan of Android, I am a fan of Google and their services. Sure wish these 2 companies could come to terms. They would surely make a great team.</p>
<p>Great news, just need to upgrade to iOS 6 , hope it s better than Apple Maps&#8230;</p>
<p>Looks like google copied window phone edge swipe for extra menu right down to the 3 little buttons. Window phone still looks sexier.</p>
<p>This is a massive bitchslap from Google to Apple! I like!</p>
<p>bitchslap? I don&#8217;t think Apple cares that much. It let it through the app store. Maybe it was more of a firm handshake. Possibly unnerving but civil.</p>
<p>Did anyone notice it kills battery faster than any other apps.</p>
<p>What is with the lack of information in both the new Apple maps and Google maps?<br />
Look at how much more info is visible without zooming in on the old maps. Sure, new google maps looks prettier, but seeing which way streets run is really useful to me. It&#8217;s the fastest and most reliable way to orient myself when getting out of a subway. The compass can be slow and wonky, especially around tall buildings.</p>
<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/e599f287028c679f6f867ab9961cf03d/tumblr_mf59rceFOI1qjpurdo1_1280.png" /></p>
<p>There are street names missing in both versions at that zoom level, but the new one seems to be missing more even though it&#8217;s zoomed in further.</p>
<p>Google to Apple: &#8220;First!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple is going to blow this away.</p>
<p>Evidence?</p>
<p>None.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5lM_KefDkg&feature=related" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5lM_KefDkg&amp;feature=related</a> &#8211; owned by Apple.</p>
<p>haha.  NO!</p>
<p>Let me add:</p>
<p>The 3D in the demo you referenced looked very similar to the kind of Stuff we&#8217;ve seen before.  I think Bing actually had better looking 3D imagery.  If you compare closely, the images in the Google demo look a lot better.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the process that Google is using seems very thorough.</p>
<p>And expensive. And for a limited number of cities.</p>
<p>Thorough nonetheless.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the evidence that this will &#8220;blow&#8221; away anything Google&#8217;s doing?</p>
<p>The hundreds of times Apple blew everything away ?</p>
<p>yea man iCloud blows away all other cloud services. Ping is where its at for social. /s</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Ping ? I&#8217;ll have to check that on Google Wave&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>the funny thing about wave is that it never came out of beta and was invite  only. At least wave features have been creeping into gmail. Ping on the other hand has completely launched.</p>
<p>Google Beta is not the same as what everyone else calls &#8220;beta&#8221;.</p>
<p>So which beta does Siri fit in?</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ve thoroughly established that both companies have had hits and misses.</p>
<p>Oh i completely agree. Just trying telling that to some of the other people on this site.</p>
<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed this #TeamGoogle vs. #TeamApple argument! Kudos to both parties :)</p>
<p>[p.s. before some clever person says it, I am fully aware this is not Twitter]</p>
<p>Vapor ware until it ships.  So is an Apple solution.  What do you think will ship first?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry but your mature responses and questions do not belong in this thread.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t even announce a ship date. Are APIs available to developers to experiement with?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d bet a pizza that whatever Apple shows off will be released to devs. I could be wrong, though</p>
<p>mmmmm, pizza</p>
<p>I&#8217;m siding with whoever wins the pizza.</p>
<p>Google has APIs for pretty much everything. So yeah, with Google you can be sure there will be devs playing with it.</p>
<p>Which is why they need to announce these things ahead of launch. People should start thinking about ideas already.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s the first-time-we-launch-something-as-a-beta beta.</p>
<p>So they&#8217;re not that different from Google. Except Google has done it before.</p>
<p>The one that doesn&#8217;t last for 5 years.</p>
<p>So what IS the time limit on beta products?</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s length of time for beta testing is normally for a year till forever.</p>
<p>Lets see when Siri is actually out of beta.</p>
<p>Next week? (Well until iOS 6 is out of beta)</p>
<p>Google Wave was amazing. No one mentions that Facebook interface today is a rip-off Wave interface&#8230; not to mention that Wave was really interesting regarding security, openness&#8230; but users were not ready.</p>
<p>I found myself wishing Wave existed last when during a mass email with a group of friends. Not sure whats stopping them from adding more features from it to gmail.</p>
<p>The problem with Wave was not the users, it was that it was glitchy, unreliable, slow, and sucked at mobile. Wave wasn&#8217;t ready, and the problem was largely that it didn&#8217;t effectively fix the problems it claimed to.</p>
<p>I never experienced the first three, but the last one is a definite yes.  Most of the time I used it, I had a Blackberry( I know ).  But when I finally picked up an Android in May &#8216;10 and realized there wasn&#8217;t a native app for Wave, I was like &#8220;WTF?&#8221;  When Google starts work on a new product the web app team and Android app team should begin work side by side and inform each other.</p>
<p>Back to the subject at hand, I thought Wave was an excellent product that like Twitter, needed high profile people to use and enjoy and find the best use cases for it and then let those bring in the mainstream users.</p>
<p>If Facebook&#8217;s interface is a direct ripoff of Wave&#8217;s interface, then Wave must have been horrible.</p>
<p>Last I checked Google Wave was not a search engine. Your logic is flawed and your point is invalid.</p>
<p>Aww, man! Here I thought I had the best argument on this comment thread.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try harder next time.</p>
<p>(Hint: The verb &#8220;check&#8221; does apply to things other than Search. For example: I&#8217;m checking The Verge right now.)</p>
<p>Thanks for that. But again, your point remains invalid. The (verb) &#8220;check&#8221; &#8211; thank you, is not what implied a search. Take another look.</p>
<p>Have you heard of Google+?</p>
<p>Hundreds? Really?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s quite a lot on YouTube, search C3 Technology.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlelVaxctI0&feature=youtube_gdata_player" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlelVaxctI0&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see anything there that &#8220;blows&#8221; Google Earth away&#8230;</p>
<p>this is at LAST YEAR&#8217;s CES&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaahKhvO_E4" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaahKhvO_E4</a></p>
<p>Who needs evidence when you have gospel?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Apple&#8217;s goal is to blow this away.  Their goal is to wean themselves off of Google.</p>
<p>And make Google lose a couple hundreds of million users in a month. Harsh.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they wish to make them lose ALL their users. Whether they&#8217;ll do it is a different story.</p>
<p>no, just the Android ones. And Tim Cook is considerably less set on that than Jobs was</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s what I meant. Until Apple decides to provide a search engine&#8230;</p>
<p>They already have something in the works &#8594; its called Siri.</p>
<p>You are aware that Apple makes use of both WolframAlpha and Google with Siri right? Its not really a search engine&#8230;</p>
<p>with Siri a HUGE portion of Searches will NO LONGER go to Google Search like they used to&#8230; all that will happen with each revision of Siri is direct connection to more and more data base and services.. completely bypassing Google.. if the absolutely can&#8217;t find anything then sure&#8230; Google it..</p>
<p>I do believe you overestimate how much people use Siri.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much Siri is used today.  The existential question for Google is how much of their search business will be lost to intelligent agents (or whatever the heck you want to call Siri, ignoring the voice UI) in the future.</p>
<p>This makes a much stronger case than Bing ever did that Google needed something like Android to avoid losing their search business to existing platform owners like Apple and Microsoft.  Samsung&#8217;s dominance and Amazon&#8217;s fork throw a wrinkle into the strategy, but business on this scale is never static.</p>
<p>Are you on crack??</p>
<p>Why, are you looking for company in the back alley or something?  Is there something specific you object to in my comment?</p>
<p>Siri is NOT a search engine. Maybe in the future. But not now.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not about google.<br />
sure, Apple and Google aren&#8217;t getting on, but it&#8217;s about autonomy. Apple doesn&#8217;t want to have to rely on technology provided by a competitor.</p>
<p>this is entirely reasonable, and won&#8217;t stop people from using gmaps.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s google making sure that the Android map app remain significantly better than Apple&#8217;s maps app that&#8217;s forcing Apple to switch.</p>
<p>Do we really believe that Apple will have found a way to replace Street View without doing the hard work of driving all of those miles? Of course not.</p>
<p>No one believed that android would be able to compete with iOS without any experience in desktop computing.</p>
<p>Who the fuck is &#8220;they&#8221; ?</p>
<p>Them. Obviously.</p>
<p>He never used the word &#8216;they&#8217;?</p>
<p>Apple just buys companies that do have the experience. Like they did for their touch interfaces and for Siri.</p>
<p>I believe Apple can do it if they want to. They have a little bit of spending money in the bank these days. They also might take the approach of just building a really solid basic mapping application with a great UI and leave the fancy stuff up to others. Maybe they&#8217;ll surprise everyone and say &#8216;oh BTW we&#8217;re going to keep using Google StreetView to compliment our maps&#8217; and you get the best of both worlds. We&#8217;ll find out next week.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t money, it&#8217;s time. You can&#8217;t solve all of your problems by throwing a bunch of money at it, otherwise Apple should have zero problems with any of it&#8217;s offerings (iTunes is still a horrible mess).</p>
<p>I agree about iTunes. As far as time . . . . It&#8217;s been 4 years since android 1.0? And more than 5 years since the first iPhone was announced. Wouldn&#8217;t that be enough time?</p>
<p>lol!</p>
<p>Its a Maps application, its hardly going to be ground breaking or innovative. As long as it gives precise directions from A to B, then im happy.</p>
<p>I wish Apple would integrate turn by turn Navigation first. I don&#8217;t need to know how to get there in a plane. Just a car.</p>
<p>Since the WHOLE REASON Apple doesn&#8217;t have turn-by-turn nav, along with other much requested features like cached maps that don&#8217;t work off-network, is Google restrictions on map data, you might be a little more enthusiastic about Apple trying to DEAL with these problems rather than simply whining.</p>
<p>I mean, Jesus, half this thread is <br />
&#8220;The food there sucks.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, and the portions are so small.&#8221;</p>
<p>More power to them to make their own solution. When they do, Google could simply update the app with all those features to match Apple&#8217;s, beat it because they&#8217;ve already done all the hard work, and keep their users.</p>
<p>Google just added offline map caching to the Maps app, one less thing for people to whine about, now what&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s excuse?</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s terms of Service still disallows offline caching, Google can readily add it to their own apps and services because they own the data, but everyone else are forbidden to do it.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t need to blow this away..</p>
<p>For once Apple is in a win/win situation when it comes to Google. Google can&#8217;t ignore iOS, so they&#8217;ll need to release this for iOS as well as for Android &#8211; and since iOS is such a significant portion of mobile web usage, it will have to be good.</p>
<p>Apple, on the other hand, isn&#8217;t going to release a maps app for Android &#8211; so even if Apple does only 1 or 2 things better than the Android map solution (which is typically how Apple rolls) &#8211; iOS users will be the only ones with the choice to use either one.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re right.  Google can be idealistic though, and if there is some kind of idealogical reason to not make Good Maps for iOS, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if google takes it.  They still hold their core competency on iOS, which is search.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not really how Google works (in my opinion)</p>
<p>Google just wants everyone to use their services &#8211; that&#8217;s how they make their money. They don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re on an iPhone, Android, Mac, PC or a toaster oven.. as long as you&#8217;re using their services, they have a path towards monetization.</p>
<p>If they fall asleep at the switch and make a sub-par service for iOS &#8211; they&#8217;ll loose..</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t make a better version for Android &#8211; but the iOS version will need to be good as well.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree.  I suppose what I&#8217;m worried about is the side of Google that decided to remove h264 support in Chrome, for example.</p>
<p>It only needs to be a tiny bit better than the built-in maps.</p>
<p>Well the Android Google Maps is way better than it&#8217;s iOS counterpart. It gets all the new stuff first regardless. I think the situation is similar for Google. Apple can release a new maps, but Google can match or surpass (most likely surpass) Apple&#8217;s efforts and remain right where they are. Unless Apple blocks all Map apps and provides navigation for free and closes all other competitors out of their market entirely.</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;Apple Difference&#8221; is that they&#8217;ll find a way to make the maps app more than just a replacement for Google but rather something more tangible that adds to the iOS lexicon.</p>
<p>Google adding 3D is nice but ultimately what does all this pretty-ness do that changes the way users interact with Google Maps? If it means waiting 30 seconds for all these pretty graphics to load users will likely stick with the top-down, standard view because ultimately they just want to get to where they&#8217;re going. Same goes for Apple.</p>
<p>If I have to wait for the graphics to load as a pan and zoom I won&#8217;t bother using the 3D view.</p>
<p>Cool story bro.</p>
<p>(Not only have you not used EITHER product, we don&#8217;t even know what Apple is doing.)</p>
<p><img src="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/8379/officespacekitmat.jpg" /></p>
<p>&#8220;idealistic&#8221;? I thought the correct word was &#8220;jerk&#8221;. <br />
&#8220;Google can be a jerk though&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>And this is to contrast with which company?</p>
<p>I seriously hope that Apple doesn&#8217;t come out with an awesome mapping application, that can only allow be used on tiny handheld screens (ipads not withstanding). Although I&#8217;m sure if they actually do provide desktop access, it will only be available on Lion and above.</p>
<p>Definitely.  Here&#8217;s to hoping that there is online support.</p>
<p>almost certainly not going to happen. Apple doesn&#8217;t give away web services. You pay to play.</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Yeaa boi I love being an Apple products user. We get Apple&#8217;s good stuff AND Google/Microsoft&#8217;s good stuff. Hehe</p>
<p>How does your view account for iOS not having Google&#8217;s navigation offerings? Or Chrome browser? Or native Gmail?</p>
<p>And the minority using Apple will love it as always.</p>
<p>&#8220;"As a whole, there have been 316 million cumulative iOS units sold to date&#8221;</p>
<p>nice minority</p>
<p>But those on the devices no longer supported will not receive the new map functionality.</p>
<p>new devices are vastly outselling old. Mostly on the grounds that you can still buy them. Apple don&#8217;t give a shit about devices you can&#8217;t buy anymore.</p>
<p>and you have to be some sort of tech-sadist to insist on keeping your 3g, since upgrading is either cheap or free.</p>
<p>The iPhone 3GS (despite how well it might actually work) will almost surely get iOS6, since it&#8217;s still being sold as the lower-end model&#8230; Being the 3GS a 3-years-old model, I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a pretty good &#8220;average&#8221; for old devices support.</p>
<p>What makes you so sure the 3GS will get iOS6? The 3G wasn&#8217;t supported by iOS5, and the 2G wasn&#8217;t supported by iOS4.</p>
<p>What makes me pretty sure is plainly stated in my previous comment: They are still selling the 3GS, and they won&#8217;t stop supporting it that soon. <br />
Obviously iOS6 on the 3GS may possibly suck as iOS4 did on the 3G, but I believe they&#8217;ll do it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Right now they are selling the 3GS, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see it discontinued when the new OS and phone come out. iOS 5 was already a pretty horrible experience on my old 3GS.</p>
<p>They will discontinue the 3GS when the 2012 iPhone&#8217;s released, and no doubt discontinue supporting it with the latest OS at the same time too. They&#8217;ve moved to a 3 model support with iOS.</p>
<p>I would expect iOS 6 to support the 3 existing iPads and the 4, 4S and 2012 iPhone</p>
<p>You mean the 3 year old devices? Since that is how long they appear to offer support for mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apple and all it&#8217;s sheep can suck a fat one.</p>
<p>Apple is going to blow this away?  Really, because Microsoft has most of the prior art here and pioneered the technique of using non-special shot pictures to construct 3D architectural imagery.  Previously, modeling in pseudo-3D required very carefully setup shots to extract enough data from a couple camera snaps.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Photosynth is vastly superior to both Apple and Google&#8217;s implementations.  Google&#8217;s main thrust is making similar technology good enough to be better than what is currently available plus expanding the technology to a wider geographical basis.  This takes a lot of work, and Apple has proven over and over again that they will not do long term hard work and maintenance on a project.  Even Siri is a shadow of the release date technology showcase because they don&#8217;t want to keep putting enough money into server time.</p>
<p>Google has demonstrated the willingness to invest in new technology on a large scale as well as maintaining it.  Following Jobs&#8217; return, Apple has consistently shown only a willingness to package and market the work of others.  The Newton is a perfect example.  The technology was evolving too slowly, so he killed it.  The iPad was only released when Samsung and a few other vendors had made the hardware cheap and miniaturized sufficiently to make Jobs happy.  There was actually nothing new or revolutionary that Apple did, they merely packaged it up nicely enough for consumers to want it.  That isn&#8217;t technology development, merely great marketing.</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynth" target="new">Photosynth.</a></p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t believe 3D will be the biggest aspect of whatever Apple&#8217;s newest thing.</p>
<p>well, apple has to catch up quite a bit in terms of navigation, map readability (if they do indeed switch to OSM) and navigation. If they manage to do all that, that would already be a huge step</p>
<p>This is amazing. Google should&#8217;ve done this a long time back.</p>
<p>Hurry up Google Maps on iPhone. :D</p>
<p>&#8220;Google should’ve done this a long time back.&#8221;  And they should have used quad core chips in all their phones years ago if we are re-writing how new products come about.</p>
<p>Did Google release this already?</p>
<p>nop, is just a promise right now.</p>
<p>This technology isn&#8217;t new, in fact it is exactly how the 3d mapping company that Apple bought operates.</p>
<p>Neither Google or Apple is first with this tech.  I think the real test will be who is able to actually implement it in a way that is usable by the average person.</p>
<p><img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/s3iljm.png" /></p>
<p>This is dumb. <br />
(a) APPLE are not making  a big deal about 3D maps, because Apple never comment about ANYTHING before it is released. It is media companies (like The Verge) that are making a big deal.<br />
(b) The 3D maps are quite likely a cute but unimportant part of new maps. The parts that people actually will care about are turn-by-turn nav and persistent caching. Both of these were not available to Apple because Google specifically restricted them from the Apple TOS. Your cartoon refuses to acknowledge that reality. If a company is asked by its customers, literally every day, &#8220;why can&#8217;t your product do X? Android does turn-by-turn. Nokia does persistent caching.&#8221; isn&#8217;t it obvious that the moment they have the power to do so they are going to change this situation?</p>
<p>&#8220;Your cartoon refuses to acknowledge that reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>LMAO.</p>
<p>Favorite thing on the internet today.</p>
<p>I disagree with one point, that 3d maps are cute and not useful. I find them useful, and I doubt I&#8217;m a unique case. 3d is very useful for scoping an area out that you&#8217;ve never before visited and helps with orientation once you are there. Top down satellite maps just don&#8217;t go far enough.</p>
<p>Oh jesus, a ragecomic, I&#8217;ve been concerned about the declining quality of the Verge community for a while, but this has just destroyed all hope.</p>
<p>The annoying part will be when Apple sues Google for &#8220;copying&#8221; their maps and 3d mapping app in a month or so.</p>
<p>If Apple makes a patent claim it would be based on patents that have been filed for some time now, although presumably Google isn&#8217;t defenceless in this area.  The fact that Google managed to get a press conference out ahead of WWDC doesn&#8217;t mean anything from a legal perspective.  Their PR &#8220;First!&#8221; troll is pretty amusing, though.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re getting at something else than a patent suit with your &#8216;suing for copying&#8217; notion, some clarification might be in order.</p>
<p>With regard to patents, it really doesn&#8217;t matter when Google holds its press conference.  It matters when the idea was invented and filed.  I don&#8217;t know who owns the rights to the ideas here, but if Google took patent ideas without license, they may be liable for infringement.  I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll find out soon enough.</p>
<p>How crazy is it that every comment above is all from the first comment? Its a huge, impossible to understand, chain. Just try to figure out what comment is a reply to what comment as the comments start to out-dent again.</p>
<p>I hope some of the Verge staff stumble into an article like this and see how impossibly hard to follow the commenting system is on this site.</p>
<p>seriously.. comment folding!!!</p>
<p>You need the Spice to be able to successfully navigate through folded comments.</p>
<p>Either the Spice or The Distributed Comment Internet Project.</p>

<p>What browser are you using? Apparently none of the 3 most popular?</p>
<p>Agree, it&#8217;s kind of funny though, that what stands on the site.<br />
&#169; Nokia, C3 Technologies<br />
C3 Technologies is the first to do it and Apple recently bought that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Google and Nokia products, so don&#8217;t get me wrong.</p>
<p>And next week everyone is going to only talk about Apple.</p>

<p>click on 3d maps. nokia anounced this 1 year ago.</p>
<p>Does not work in Ubuntu Chromium&#8230;</p>
<p>C3 (the company that Apple bought) showed even better than this actually running on an actual product at CES LAST YEAR..  can you read? Google says &#8220;coming soon&#8221;&#8230; Google was outdone by a tiny Scandinavian company with a few guys working on it.. and it&#8217;s STILL not an actually released product yet..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, you must not be aware what is SAAB then.</p>
<p>This product was never released either, so how could Google have been &#8220;outdone&#8221;??</p>
<p>It actually was&#8230;but not for a phone, and only in Sweden.</p>
<p>This technology has been used for a few years by a local &#8220;google map&#8221; type of website here in Sweden. But the 3D portion of the site was removed when Apple brought C3.</p>
<p>I am talking about the mobile product shown at CES. Everybody already knows about the sites using this technology.</p>
<p>Nokias 3D mapping is using C3 Technologies&#8217;s technology&#8230; So it&#8217;s a actual product though only on specific browsers.<br />

<p>Well Apple apparently bought the company that Nokia was using (or going to use?) for their 3D mapping.</p>
<p>Looks awsome, looking forward to using it on my iPad. <br />
Also looking forward to see what apple shows us at WWDC.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for a better maps experience and since google is now obviously developing it&#8217;s own google maps app for iOS I can totally see that happening.</p>
<p>As for Apples own rumored maps service, competition is always good but currently google is a gigant in this area and my money&#8217;s on google for the time being. I assume there&#8217;s a reason why apple never implemented all of googles map features in the stock iOS app, that would put apple in a bad light when they annonunce their own maps service if it can&#8217;t compete with google maps on equal grounds.</p>
<p>Google will come out with an iOS app.. as well as google navigation.  its just a matter of how long Apple drags their feet before allowing it into the app store.</p>
<p>Given the fact that many other companies have mapping and navigation apps in Apple&#8217;s store, I think it is unlikely they&#8217;ll want to invite political scrutiny by dragging their feet on a Google Maps app.  I&#8217;m prepared to be surprised, though.</p>
<p>And Apple cares about political scrutiny since&#8230; when?</p>
<p>Since they&#8217;re not stupid enough to invite a Microsoft-scale antitrust beatdown, presumably.  Any evidence to the contrary?</p>
<p>Sorry, but since when does Apple hold enough market share to actually abuse it?</p>
<p>Since <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-11/u-s-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple-hachette.html" target="new">April</a> anyway.  I&#8217;m guessing you could use that googley-tubes thing to find previous situations where governments rattled the antitrust sabres at Apple over <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/08/fcc-opens-investigations-iphone-app-discrimination" target="new">one thing</a> or <a href="http://gigaom.com/apple/norway-itunes-drm-war/" target="new">another</a>.  Are you going to say Apple didn&#8217;t care about any of that?</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; Passive aggressive ad hom. Nice.</p>
<p>Context is &#8211; apps in AppStore, legally apps on mobile platform. Apple is not in any dominant position in mobile platforms.</p>
<p>eBooks thing is about collusion, not market dominance abuse. <br />
iTMS is actually the dominant music store, specifically was in Norway in 2008.<br />
3 years of FCC investigation and no outcome whatsoever.</p>
<p>Your original question to me was, &#8220;And Apple cares about political scrutiny since… when?&#8221;</p>
<p>My answer is that Apple is not stupid, they&#8217;ve had to deal with political scrutiny before, and therefore they&#8217;re going to be careful about inviting more of it by doing something like blocking Google Maps.  Especially when they&#8217;ve allowed a wide range of other, similar apps.  And yes I got a bit edgy in my answer, but I don&#8217;t see why I should have to explain something that would be obvious to anyone who has the business sense that $deity gave a shoeshine boy.</p>
<p>I doubt Apple is any more interested in blocking this app than they are interested in blocking competitive e-readers from iOS.</p>
<p>Apple never implemented all of the Google Map features because Google would not let them.  Google was angling to make the Google logo more prominent on the maps for instance, in return for allowing some access to feature&#8230;</p>
<p>That looks absolutely kickass compared to Nokia 3D maps.</p>
<p>we dont know so far, for sure they chose the best looking pictures. it&#8217;s basically the same principle, but newer technology, so, yes, it is probably more accurate. but still, nokia maps are pretty kickass</p>
<p>On an iPad? I mean I get it but at least show it on Android too, jeez it&#8217;s your product.</p>
<p>i think there was a certain reason why they showed the demo on an ipad&#8230;</p>
<p>I understand that to like show that even with Apples new map service they wills till be completive, but they only showed a screenshot of it on Android no demo. Tells me maybe the focus was on iOS. They explicitly said they have problem getting it on a wide array of device it&#8217;s just a matter of time, this tells me iOS first, Android after.</p>
<p>It is rumored that next week at WDC12 apple is going to announce that they are dropping google as the maps provider in iOS (apple recently aquired C3 technologies, a mapping company).</p>
<p>Google demoed this on an ipad to stick it to apple.</p>
<p>C3 technologies is just a 3d mapping company.  In fact their technology operates exactly like how Google&#8217;s new 3d service is portrayed to work.  I wonder if Apple is licensing their technology to google in order to get better access to google&#8217;s 2d map data.</p>
<p>For their future maps app</p>
<p>Is no one understanding I know all that?  I am very up to date but sticking it to Apple isn&#8217;t the answer it&#8217;s improving your own platform not theres.</p>
<p>I think it says the exact opposite, apples customers will get to choose between google maps or apple maps, which is a plus for both users and apple.</p>
<p>Did you expect them to say it IS a problem getting it on a wide array of devices?</p>
<p>Well yeah&#8230; because thats what they said. They talked about all the different type of code</p>
<p>It was only to make the ipad crash several times in front of the audience^^</p>
<p>Yeah, it actually crashed on the iPad during the presentation.</p>
<p>It is a test app&#8230;</p>
<p>^ from Apple</p>
<p>ikid :D</p>
<p>They showed another demo on an Android devices.<br />
The big big difference between Google and their competitor is that Google is a web company first.<br />
Google wants to be on all devices.<br />
Mostly because that&#8217;s how they are making money.<br />
The&#8217;re not making money by selling Android or Chrome OS devices.</p>
<p>People keep misunderstanding me, I understand everything you just said. they need to be on iOS never did I say shouldn&#8217;t ever. I said they should of demo&#8217;d Android too. Which they should have done no one can debate me they shouldn&#8217;t, it was only a 30 second demo just show it to be. The offline maps on the Galaxy nexus is something we could already do with labs that demo didn&#8217;t matter THIS demo mattered and it&#8217;s incredibly annoying that didn&#8217;t at least show Android.</p>
<p>I think they wanted to reassure investors &amp; partners they will still have a presence on iOS in the future.</p>
<p>Wow, the quality of the 3d models was really impressive!</p>
<p>Hmm, so this is Google Earth not Maps? I don&#8217;t really use Earth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll come to Maps as well as Earth.</p>
<p>Ah, okay. Cool.</p>
<p>They should combine maps and earth</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>So.. a more advanced version of birds eye view from Bing Maps? Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>I actually like birds eye view on Bing Maps, but those are pictures taken by flying by.  They don&#8217;t actually make them 3D, which is definitely a difference, and a large step ahead.</p>
<p>i prefer the Bing way of doing it, personally. Gives a much better view of things that aren&#8217;t necessarily buildings. Also, birds-eye-view currently covers far more than a few cities.</p>
<p>oh seriously ?<br />
this new technology is absolutely stunning. it is nearly a millenia dream realised. Microsoft Maps were just a google maps with fewer feature last time I checked.</p>
<p>you can love microsoft but don&#8217;t be blind!</p>
<p>ha&#8230; I don&#8217;t love microsoft at all, just happen to think birds-eye-view is a pretty awesome feature available <em>right now</em> in a mapping app. Based on the article and the pictures provided by this article, it made it seem like the new 3D maps by google were only going to apply to urban buildings. With bing, you can get a much better sense of the terrain and the height of trees and other structures (especially in non-urban areas) than standard aerial views provide . You should try it sometime.</p>
<p>BEV is acceptable technology for the moment, but it doesn&#8217;t begin to compare to real 3D modeling like the one displayed here. And there&#8217;s no reason to think Google will not eventually expand 3D maps to rural areas as well.</p>
<p>I think you need to go try Bing Maps again, this appears to be a direct copy of it.</p>
<p>Not really. Bing BEV only shows certain angles. It&#8217;s not really 3D.</p>
<p>With this you can rotate the map in real time. Unlike BEV where you only have 4 angles.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of Google Earth? I guess it&#8217;s like the digital version of owning a globe&#8230; which I don&#8217;t. Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>To sell more ads, dooo</p>
<p>Research?</p>
<p>3D is only good for surveying, stalking. They should innovate more on turn-by-turn, transit and other stuff.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re just trying to slow-down the inevitable avalanche of Apple fans who will scream how awesome 3D maps are when Apple switches to their own maps.</p>
<p>This is so freakin&#8217; sweet</p>
<p>I think Google will be allowed to sell a Maps application on the App Store.  Apple&#8217;s new maps system will become the framework for developers to use.</p>
<p>If Apple allows them to sell Google Maps on iOS&#8230;..</p>
<p>Once again, why is this tech not being cross licensed to an open world video game concept?</p>
<p>They do, but only for the US Army</p>
<p>Looks great but&#8230; how does this help me navigate the world? If I want to see Paris, I&#8217;d rather fly there, not visit on my iPad.</p>
<p>No denying it&#8217;s cool and extremely innovative&#8230; but how does this help me live my life better?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember the part of the presentation where they said that they made this so that no one will want or need to travel again.</p>
<p>I never said that&#8217;s what it was for&#8230; but I&#8217;m still trying to figure out&#8230; what is it for? Google Maps is useful&#8230; but how does this 3D view, and all the money they spent flying planes over the world taking photographs&#8230; how does that benefit me or you?</p>
<p>Psst&#8230; Your brain is capable at recognizing tall landmarks and operates in 3 dimensions.</p>
<p>Would you rather spend hundreds of dollars flying out to the end of the world just to see what a monument or building looks like?</p>
<p>Kinda, yeah. ;)</p>
<p>I&#8230;. don&#8217;t even.. know how to answer this.</p>
<p>I know&#8230; it&#8217;s almost impossible to figure out what this 3D map is for, right?</p>
<p>can you afford a fly by over Paris every times you want ? <br />
If yes then it&#8217;s totally useless.</p>
<p>When I want to see a landmark in France, I hop on my private plane.</p>
<p>I am the 1%.</p>
<p>Most people can&#8217;t afford to just take trips to random cities they&#8217;d like to see.  It makes your life better because you can see every city in the world at no cost.</p>

<p>Oh I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t realize I was being an idiot because I was trying to understand what this was meant to be used for other than the gimmick of being able to see a 3D image of our world.</p>
<p>No doubt that it&#8217;s very cool, but again&#8230; no one has answered this question&#8230; How does this help me? What is the point of this 3D map?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of pictures on a 2D map? All we really need is street names, really.</p>
<p>But having 2D pictures enhances how we find things. It&#8217;s easier to see landmarks on a street to note how to get from A to B, or to find stuff nearby.</p>
<p>A 3D map is just an enhanced 2D map, except it works from more of a human perspective. We don&#8217;t see the world in 2D, so seeing it in 3D will simply enhance the ability to find where we are and how to get places.</p>
<p>Also, the hope for &#8220;vertical location&#8221; in the article sounds really cool.</p>
<p>Thank you for not being a condescending Verge commenter. Nice to see that there are still a few out there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried using Google Earth to plot a few trips, and found the directions very confusing and not very useful. Having a top-down view with left and right is much more user friendly when driving, not to mention I don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s safe to be enjoying 3D maps while driving.</p>
<p>I can understand using it to find your way when on foot, but I still don&#8217;t see how it would benefit me at that point. All I need to know is if I&#8217;m going NSWE&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just a luddite though&#8230; I just know that if I were an investor, I&#8217;d wish they spent more time improving their products in ways that the majority of users would benefit.</p>
<p>It depends on how you process. I can look at a map with lines for streets and find my way, but my memory is stimulated by visuals, as I suppose many are. Whenever I go for a map, I look for landmarks before right and left turns. It makes it much easier.</p>
<p>Recently, I moved to college in Louisville, KY. While the 2D maps are really helpful in the country, the &#8220;top-down&#8221; look in the city doesn&#8217;t really help. The 3D is really helpful to find these landmarks, and get a feel for what a drive will look like.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t begrudge you for that. Thanks for your thoughtful reply.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t see the point. 3d is cool, but if I want to go from A to B, I&#8217;d view it from the top and not from an angle. It&#8217;s way way easier for people to see how to go from A to B if they view the visualization from the top. The &#8220;3D enhances the 2D experience&#8221; is partly true but at the cost of huge expenses? For minimal improvement in user experience? And the visit a landmark shit people are saying, normal pictures work nice, too, if I want to get a feel of the place. If it turns to yearning, then I visit. I don&#8217;t mind if the implementation is cheap, but Google will be spending millions to acquire this data. What&#8217;s the point? It doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>PS. By contrast, Apple&#8217;s new maps will probably be more about turn-by-turn navigation and the other stuff Android maps have that Apple can&#8217;t have because of the ToS restrictions. The acquisition of C# is totally justified.</p>
<p>I like how they showed all the humanitarian things that google maps is used for. Tell me if apple even gives a crap about anyone else. They dont use their tech for anything other than their own products.Look at them constantly trying to sue other companies. Buncha douches&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a different business model. Apple makes money by selling hardware. To do this, they need to have exclusive features and designs. Google makes money by selling ads. To do this, their services must continue to be innovative and ubiquitous on the Internet. The nature of these differing models causes Apple to be very protective of their patents and Google to wish them to be freely propagated.</p>
<p>Using your own tech for your own products to make your own money is not being a douchebag, it&#8217;s the way business works&#8230;</p>
<p>Did you guys take that picture with Instagram?</p>
<p>Nokia announced the same thing one year back ! ! <a href="http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/04/19/ovi-maps-3d-the-world-is-not-flat/" target="_blank">http://conversations.nokia.com/2011/04/19/ovi-maps-3d-the-world-is-not-flat/</a></p>
<p>I see it&#8217;s done wonders for their business!</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not automatically generated using plane. Nokia modeled it.</p>
<p>No, actually. The Nokia models are generated much in the same way Google&#8217;s are/will be, using a variety of photographs taken of a building from lots of different angles. It seems that Google has taken the same basic procedure and optimized it further.</p>
<p>You know, I&#8217;m betting that the real loser in this battle won&#8217;t be Apple or Google- it&#8217;s Bing Maps.</p>
<p>Nah, I can see Bing Maps getting better with some technology partnerships with Nokia (who owns Navteq)</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you&#8217;re right- Microsoft seemed to be one step ahead of the game a few years back and was demoing some great tech (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCPzji_-2Oo" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCPzji_-2Oo</a>) but has struggled to bring it to market.</p>
<p>So, isn&#8217;t this &#8211; auto generated 3d from satellite/plane images &#8211; exactly what C3&#8217;s tech is all about? Can&#8217;t wait to see who will do a better job with it.</p>
<p>Exactly what I&#8217;m surprised no one is bringing this up.  It&#8217;s seems that the two technologies are exactly the same.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think maybe some sort of cross-liscensing deal between the two so Apple could get better access to Google&#8217;s 2d map data.</p>
<p>I highly doubt Google would be looking to get into another patent battle with Apple regarding this tech, but it clearly seems to be doing the exact same thing.</p>
<p>Preemptive Strike on Google&#8217;s part, the problem is nobody is watching.</p>
<p>Apple, if they do indeed have something worth showing next week with their own maps, will be showing it to a third of the planet :)</p>
<p>You watched.</p>
<p>D&#8217;oh!</p>
<p>so this is why google sold sketh up becouse it ddint need it anymore for google earth&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yep, makes perfect sense now.</p>
<p>Yeah Verge, Pictures doesn&#8217;t cut it &#8211; could we get a movie please.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Douyfa7l8&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Douyfa7l8&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>
<p>Thanks for the link. It is pretty damn impressive looking.</p>
<p>Lol great video but the music made me feel like I was about to play a high def version of sims&#8230;</p>
<p>What is the &#8220;300 million people&#8221; statistic referring to at the end of the photo gallery?  I&#8217;m guessing users, but mobile, web, combined? Monthly, daily?  Looked for this in the article but did not see it.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s referring to the fact that 300 million people will be able to see their home in this new 3d technology by the end of the year or something like that</p>
<p>I anticpate Apple&#8217;s maps are going to actually take us inside buildings and peoples homes.</p>
<p>Google already does that.</p>
<p>So this map software looks really good, and im sure apple has something in the works that is really good too. but i cant think of how it would be better than this&#8230;. 4D maps?</p>
<p>That would be turn by turn navigation. They should get that working ahead of some gmmick like 3D mapping yes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why they felt they needed to do this now. Google I/O is in a few weeks, and maybe by then they would have had more than an extremely crashy tech demo.</p>
<p>Offline maps is great, but isn&#8217;t a new announcement, neither really is their evolution of 3d mapping. I&#8217;m not saying they aren&#8217;t nice updates or important for Google, but it just comes across as desperate when I see little reason for them to be.</p>
<p>They wanted to show themselves as the leaders in mapping before Apple could announce they are dropping Google.</p>
<p>Well yes I mean I get the premise, I just don&#8217;t like it. They&#8217;re already widely regarded as the leader in mapping.</p>
<p>Here they are rushing something based on Apple&#8217;s schedule. If anything, announcing something they feel is superior shortly after Apple at I/O would seem more effective to me &#8211; like &#8220;oops, looks like you guys are missing out on this awesome new maps stuff we just officially unveiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much of a difference 3 more weeks would&#8217;ve made in terms of presentation quality. Relax.</p>
<p>its because of whatever Apple announces next week for mapping. My guess is Google will actually release its Google Maps/navigation for iOS at Google IO</p>
<p>That is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Glad to see that it will be available on iOS (as long as it doesn&#8217;t crash like in the demo, lol). iOS users will win, but having both Google and Apple as choices for maps. Too bad it&#8217;s no the same in reverse for Android users.</p>
<p>Google Maps for Android is already the best, so we&#8217;re not complaining.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps3d.svc.nokia.com/webgl/index.html" target="_blank">http://maps3d.svc.nokia.com/webgl/index.html</a></p>
<p>Nokia’s 3D Maps that is powered by C3 Technologies</p>
<p>Compare C3&#8217;s SF city hall to Google&#8217;s version, C3 is better looking IMHO.</p>
<p>what worries me more is Google&#8217;s recent patent for location based actions&#8230; how will that affect iOS</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad to see Google fall like this.  You can tell the great technology companies from the mediocre ones: the great ones say &#8220;this is what we&#8217;ve done&#8221;, while the mediocre ones say &#8220;this is what we will do&#8221;.</p>
<p>If Apple has something like this, the announcement will typically be followed by &#8220;Available today&#8221;, or &#8220;Shipping in two weeks&#8221;.  They don&#8217;t announce anything until it has a delivery date, and usually a pretty close one.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if they realize it, but Google is putting themselves in the company of such greats as 2010&#8217;s RIM and 1990&#8217;s Apple.  This is not an enviable position to be in.  &#8220;Coming soon&#8221; is just a dream.  Anybody can put out some nice graphics and say &#8220;Coming soon&#8221;.  Until it&#8217;s shipping nobody can guess if it&#8217;ll be a big hit like Docs or a dud like Buzz.</p>
<p>thats how google works. They announce a product, then put it out before it fully completed, then improve it as it goes along.  Google is not apple get that through your head. Both of them have different systems of releasing a product and both of them are successful at it.</p>
<p>But this is not what Google is doing.  They&#8217;re not putting it out yet.  They&#8217;re pre-announcing a-la Microsoft.  It&#8217;s the whole, &#8220;you may have released it first, but we announced it first!&#8221; thing.  Super annoying.</p>
<p>And when Apple announces their in the WWDC, will it be avaliible then or will it be ready for iOS 6?</p>
<p>WWDC is a developer conference.  They announce two kinds of things there.  One is things that developers use to build software, like a new Xcode, and those are typically available right away.  The other is platforms and interfaces that developers will build for, like a new Mac OS X, and those are typically distributed as developer previews to WWDC attendees.</p>
<p>Since mapping is part of iOS, if they have a new mapping app for iOS 6, then it will probably be in the next iOS dev preview.  It&#8217;s admittedly in a bit of a funny place because it&#8217;s an end-user app and not something that devs really need to use or integrate with.  Another difference is that iOS 6, when announced, will probably have a much more definitive release date than &#8220;soon&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apple tends to not announce unless it&#8217;s close to shipping.  They won&#8217;t announce a product before it is ready.  Google is very much tyring to pre-empt Apple and steal mind share.  They should have waited until after WWDC imho.</p>
<p>Google tells the world what they are working on. Apple leaks things and &#8220;loses phones in bars&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which is the more professional option?</p>
<p>Stop being a sourpuss. If the product&#8217;s great, guess what? <strong>It&#8217;ll BE great</strong>, whether it&#8217;s announced 2 weeks before or 200 weeks before. Right now it seems like Google just pissed on your Apple-loving sensibilities by launching a preemptive salvo.</p>
<p>So this is why Google has sold SketchUp &#8211; for better and more amazing technology.</p>
<p>Bet the thousands of people who donated their time to make millions of structures for free are a little ticked.</p>
<p>This is one of their killer apps (Maps, Search, Gmail)</p>
<p>Apple could possible hit them right in the mouth with their own mapping solution. If they bring something better and more integration, this could be a big problem for Google revenue</p>
<p>If not, then Google will continue to dominate with the superior product</p>
<p>This is really really cool, but I wonder how often one would really use something like this?</p>
<p>For example, Nokia, Bing, Google all have had areal views for a while and they all have some form of 3D view (even if this is an improvement).</p>
<p>Yet, anytime I&#8217;m trying to look up where something is or how to get someplace, all I do is look at the 2D illustrated version. Even areal view gets annoying, forget 3D views&#8230;</p>
<p>GPS Navigation + this = Perfection</p>
<p>No videos?</p>
<p>Which company (apple or google) has already launched a successful and revolutionary mapping app?</p>
<p>Enough with the Google/Apple bashing garbage.</p>
<p>Google and Apple are both working on 3D maps, and like Bing vs. Google search, there&#8217;s not going to be all that much difference. Apple has bought a lot of data and companies to get their map application done. Apple is doing maps because they don&#8217;t trust Google to keep their iOS applications up to date. After all, iOS is just another competitor to Google.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t care about 3D mapping. All I can say is that if Apple doesn&#8217;t release turn-by-turn directions in their up coming iOS Map app, it&#8217;s a big fat fail no matter how mouthwatering wonderful their 3D effects are.</p>
<p>Hey instead of working on 3D effects that will wow us for the first five minutes, why not:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fix the address data? Take Jersey City&#8217;s waterfront, all of the addresses are messed up. They&#8217;re off by blocks. In my neighborhood about 20% of the addresses are incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Fill in street view. I depend upon street view to verify addresses because the basic addresses in most maps are not accurate. However, there are too many things in the way to see buildings. Take cars. In New York, most streets are alternate side of the street parking. That means that there&#8217;s always one side of the street that&#8217;s car free. Why not come back the next day and do the other side of the street?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Finish the other GPS like features. I don&#8217;t use my Garmin anymore, but I do miss many features that are still not available in Google Maps or the other phone GPS mapping apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;re working on address location data. They&#8217;re starting to use ReCAPTCHA to read the house numbers from street view images to pinpoint locations.</p>
<p>Put this in video games. Now.</p>
<p>I wonder how good this looks when you get up close to the buildings. It&#8217;s fine to have a texture that maps a whole building in a postage stamped screenshot or long distance flyby) but in a game when you &#8220;walk up close&#8221; to that building it still would need to look good.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s just 4 days now and world is gonna see this and probably the whole world in 3D on iOS! :)</p>

<p>Something something Google Apple comment.</p>
<p>#Google4Life</p>
<p>Hopefully it will have a bakery serving the latest version of Android.</p>
<p>Genius! How about <span class="caps">ALL</span> versions of Android?</p>
<p>I could go for that&hellip; Key Lime Pie would be my Ultimate fav on that menu though!!</p>
<p>HA! And with Google entering and taking over many sectors of the business and tech world&hellip; a chain of bakeries too?</p>
<p>They should start calling versions of chromebook os after drinks and they could have their own in-store cafes serving up froyos and tea, honeycomb and cola and key lime pie and hot chocolate</p>
<p>Rotating menu?!?!</p>
<p>Sadly I think that would be impractical. Can&rsquo;t see the carriers allowing it.</p>
<p>&hellip; not without stamping their logo on the dishes and running all flavors through a rigorous approval process. Then they&rsquo;ll throw on toppings that you didn&rsquo;t ask for and won&rsquo;t let you order anything else for 2 years.</p>
<p>Lol, good.  Alas, on mobile.</p>
<p>f*ck them already. they just need to give unlimited traffic for 10$ a month and shut up</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip; that&rsquo;s not going to happen. Shoot for $50 maybe? $75 would be a start right?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that unrealistic. I&rsquo;m getting unlimited everything for 100 <span class="caps">NIS</span>. My carrier is now offering unlimited everything for 50 <span class="caps">NIS</span>. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of about 12 <span class="caps">USD</span>. No contracts, no ETFs.</p>
<p>Yes but covering the Negev just means towers along the highways. The rest of Israel is the same size as the coastal part of southern California. So if carriers only had to cover San Diego to Santa Barbara and inland as far as Palm Springs, they too could charge $12.</p>
<p>But america has also much more people so that should compensate for that.</p>
<p>The US is the 178th densely population country in the world. Brazil, Russia, Australia and Canada are less densely populated, but that&rsquo;s about it of the large nations.</p>
<p>Is that your only problem? The finnish <span class="caps">LTE</span> is getting overran by russian aviation signals, resulting in <span class="caps">LTE</span> free zones in the country. All because the EU can not get their facts right before standardizing technology.</p>
<p>I think It can happen eventually, I mean if one of the big carriers doesn&rsquo;t do it. It creates a huge window of opportunity. I could easily see some international carriers setting up shop and undercutting the big guys. Maybe even a data only service that starts on tablets and such and then when things go volte or voice over data, they&rsquo;ll be ready to go and serve up phones everywhere.</p>
<p>Uh&hellip;.$T-Mobile?</p>
<p>Are you talking in the US or every country? I assume you are talking US based on context; the US has a lot of network area to cover so $10 a Monty is highly unrealistic&hellip;</p>
<p>Why not? They let places like WalMart, Target and Best Buy sell their respective devices.</p>
<p>It would help in a big way in explaining to customers the difference between pure Android and &lsquo;software enhanced&rsquo; versions of Android.</p>
<p>It would be a huge boon for everyone since the employees could be specifically selected based on their knowledge of the various brands without too much dilution from competing OSs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge difference between selling devices, and allowing any version of Android to be put onto any device.</p>
<p>I think roessnakhan and jordan.mcrae were talking about an actual bakery serving jelly beans, ice cream sandwiches, etc, not a place where one can install said android versions onto one&rsquo;s devices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure they were talking about installing android versions</p>
<p>but this idea is roughly a bajillion times better</p>
<p>so yes if they could do this i&rsquo;d be officially on board for whatever retail store they want to make</p>
<p>Carriers won&#8217;t allow? Good thing the UK networks don&#8217;t have that much sway.</p>
<p>An in-house bakery of the updates would be awesome!</p>
<p>like ikea!</p>
<p>Hopefully by then I&rsquo;ll be able to get the Nexus 4 bumper there.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will have real customer service. Google is a nightmare to deal with if you have ever bought anything from then.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://hittingthelearningcurve.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/dilbert20071112.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Maybe I didn&rsquo;t have to deal with them when it was truly as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but I had to deal with them when I ordered my Nexus 7 when it was first released.</p>
<p>I had one of the the early adopters&rsquo; problem of a raised glass lip on one side. I filled out a quick description of the problem online and was called within a minute. I talked to someone very friendly, and I was off the phone within 10 minutes. A new Nexus 7 was on the way&hellip; although it took a few weeks due to supply issues.</p>
<p>I had a pretty pleasant experience with support. Really, I think Google&rsquo;s problem was/is timely distribution, correctly estimating possible demand, and generally just being suckface at the hardware game in general. Their current lineup is solid and the hardware itself is very good, though. They&rsquo;re pretty new at it, so I&rsquo;m not all that surprised, but I would have thought it would have been at least a little better than what it&rsquo;s been the last year or two.</p>
<p>I think they&rsquo;ve had some serious wake-up calls though lately. Let&rsquo;s hope the Motorola guys can give some advice for next time. If there&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s clear: people are affected by first impressions. More focus should be delivering on that first impression when dealing with tangible products that can&rsquo;t be seamlessly updated to fix major bugs within hours or days of discovery, but instead take several weeks to months to deal with supply issues and to iron out some wrinkles in the manufacturing process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>although it took a few weeks due to supply issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have never had a consumer electronics company treat me like that. That is why I hate paying Google for anything.</p>
<p>But that isn&rsquo;t customer service, that&rsquo;s just being sucky at estimating demands. If you don&rsquo;t have the supplies, you&rsquo;ll simply have to make your customers wait.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have never had a consumer electronics company treat me like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently you&rsquo;ve never had to wait for an in-demand Apple product?</p>
<p>Even Apple succumbs to this when their demand is high. They&rsquo;re much better at restocking supplies, but they&rsquo;ve been at it much longer too.</p>
<p>All I&rsquo;m saying is customer service issues != supply issues.</p>
<p>Instant gratification  Will be the death of this nation</p>
<p>Laziness is the mother of invention</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the US, fine.</p>
<p>Anywhere else in the world, good luck (particularly since the US staff don&rsquo;t understand European distance selling regulations).</p>
<p>Mmmm donuts</p>
<p>A la mobile&hellip;</p>
<p>With every device you buy, they should serve you the appropriate Android version free.</p>
<p>Well a majority of what they serve would be stale day olds. The second most wouldn&rsquo;t. E fresh but at least likely not spoiled. A small percentage would be fresh, but a typical muffin would be the size of a pie plate.</p>
<p>A Google Store&hellip;.. where everything is always out of stock&hellip; genius?!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the vast majority will be stale leftovers from old versions so as to mirror the dynamics of the actual Android platform ;)</p>
<p>Apple Store Clone</p>
<p>Not really &ndash; Google&rsquo;s Chrome Zones are quite different to Apple Stores.</p>
<p>Yeah, obviously elements will be similar but there&rsquo;s no point in not diversifying the experiences.</p>
<p>Why? Because it&rsquo;s a store?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you know that only Apple can have stores?</p>
<p>It is a fact that Apple really invented Stores. Look at all these rounded corners ! They are only here thanks to Apple !</p>
<p>What rounded corners? It&rsquo;s all about glass cubes!</p>
<p>Google stores should have rounded corner storefronts just to mess with the iFanboys.</p>
<p>They need to make pyramidal stores for people not to consider them as Apple store knock offs.</p>

<p>Stop kidding yourself, this is obviously a shameless copy of the Apple Store. To start with, that room is a rectangle. <strong>How do you explain that?</strong></p>
<p>Not to mention that the room contains air in it. Coincidence?</p>
<p>the department of redundancy department approves of this post is approved.</p>
<p>Stamp!</p>
<p>That stamp is not bureaucratic enough! That post requires at least 4 more stamps!</p>
<p>Stamp!</p>
<p>I bet the rectangles all have 90 deg interior angles too!</p>
<p>Sue them!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s many more colors though!  :)</p>
<p>Apple iPod had colors!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Apple must have invented colors&hellip;</p>
<p>But then again, Apple copied seemingly everyone else that has ever had a store before&hellip;</p>
<p>Everybody place your bets on what they will title their rip off &ldquo;Geniuses&rdquo;. Data Men? Lol. ;)</p>
<p>I imagine they&rsquo;ll use a term with a little less branding bullshit, like &lsquo;employees&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ya cause doing something in a way that actually resonates with customers, leaves an impression, and rolls off the tongue nicely is just BS!</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>If anything they&rsquo;ll copy the &ldquo;Geek Squad&rdquo;, which existed way before the &ldquo;Genius Bar&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Googlers?</p>
<p>So, they cannot even have their stuff in stock on their own online store, and they want to open a b&amp;m retail store?</p>
<p>At least in a b&amp;m they&rsquo;ll know what they have in stock.</p>
<p>It also would be a great way to try out the devices before making an order or preorder. But I also agree that they would need to get their supply chain in order before making such an attempt.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s in stock in their warehouses that&rsquo;s even more of a worry&hellip;</p>
<p>You assume a lot. An algorithm will tell them what they have in stock. And offer ads while you wait for a live person to verify.</p>
<p>Would be nice still in case you have a problem and need an exchange or service.</p>
<p>Showrooming. </p>
<p>They explicitly said the only reason the Explorer edition was so expensive was to make sure only serious interests were involved.  I truly doubt the end product will be that expensive.  Doubly so since they&rsquo;ve stated in the past it uses roughly Galaxy Nexus level internals.</p>
<p>But apparently Glass won&rsquo;t use Android &ndash; it&rsquo;s Chrome-based, which is incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>Android doesn&rsquo;t really have anything to do with the hardware of it.  It can still use Galaxy Nexus level <span class="caps">CPU</span>, radios, etc without having to ever even approach Android.  It will be interesting to see how they&rsquo;ll work together though.  I mean, I would love my phone&rsquo;s notifications piped out to my glasses.</p>
<p>That is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard that, although I haven&rsquo;t been following Glass closely, but you&rsquo;re right that is very interesting.</p>
<p>Also, this makes me think they don&rsquo;t want to work exclusively with Android devices, which does make sense.</p>
<p>Are you sure? Why did a compliance specialist from the Android team sign Glass <span class="caps">FCC</span> documents and why are they addressed from the Android teams building 1600 if it&rsquo;s not running Android?</p>

<p>The operating system software used in the glasses will be Google&rsquo;s Android.<a href="#fn6">6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which refers to this NY Times Article: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/technology/google-glasses-will-be-powered-by-android.html?_r=3&" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/technology/google-glasses-will-be-powered-by-android.html?_r=3&amp;</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Wikipedia. Take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>And the NY Times&hellip;</p>
<p>I wish I had the link but I remember reading an article that on average wiki was <span class="caps">MORE</span> accurate than even the encyclopaedia Britannica and others, a quick Google search can prob bring it up.  I think they said it was more accurate Cuz it was up to date when ever  anything happened.</p>
<p> For its study, Nature chose articles from both sites in a wide range of topics and sent them to what it called &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articles&mdash;one from each site on a given topic&mdash;side by side, but were not told which article came from which site. Nature got back 42 usable reviews from its field of experts.</p>
<p>In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts, in the articles. Of those, four came from each site. They did, however, discover a series of factual errors, omissions or misleading statements. All told, Wikipedia had 162 such problems, while Britannica had 123.</p>
<p>That averages out to 2.92 mistakes per article for Britannica and 3.86 for Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The good thing about Wikipedia is that you can easily verify if the article has sources, regardless of what is written in it.</p>
<p>Chrome &hellip; aren&rsquo;t we talking about crunching a lot of JavaScript then ??  I would have thought that is gonna take a bit of cpu but &hellip;</p>
<p>You will still get Google Now though !!</p>
<p>Also it is a prototype. It is a lot more expensive (per unit) to make say 1000 then it is to make 100,000)</p>
<p>god, please hurry. once you factor in tax and shipping it adds another $50 to a nexus 4.</p>
<p>About $33 for me. MD</p>
<p>Ya, just depends where you live. My tax and shipping was $14.62. HI</p>
<p>Lol importing that to my country with shipping costs less overall than your tax :)</p>
<p>Will I receive an ad as soon as I walk in?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Google makes most of their money from advertisements.</p>
<p>I think barely clever, obvious jokes shouldn&rsquo;t be encouraged.</p>
<p>The entire store is an ad. Every store is an ad for the products they are selling, or is there something I am missing?</p>
<p>No, there will be ads in the walls.</p>
<p>     unless you and the Store are in a desert,  you Will see Ads on the highway there</p>
<p>It is funny how Verge compares this to Apple Store yet this actually is to target Microsoft in PC space with their Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The Microsoft store is based on Apple&rsquo;s success as well, so not really.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see what you said is relevant, sorry.</p>
<p>Apple were the first technology company to really get into controlling their own retail experience. Many people predicted it would fail, but actually it has been incredibly successful for them, and they make more money per square foot than any other retail stores in the US.</p>
<p>It also allows them to avoid the Best Buy etc gatekeepers who might recommend products on bad information, or just because Best Buy want to sell more of something. And control how their brand is presented to people.</p>
<p>Microsoft have started using a similar strategy for their retail presence, and now Google are apparently joining in too. Not too complicated, but my comment was a little short perhaps.</p>
<p>Apple maybe the first one to start this but that does not mean Google is targeting them. Your point does not make any sense. It is like saying Ford/Daimeler made the first car and Ferrari entered to market because of Fords of success. Chromebook is targeting low-end Windows laptops and with a retail presence google will try to build awareness. This has nothing to do with apple</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t notice you said targeting.</p>
<p>Either way, they are obviously working from the same playbook, and working to compete with Microsoft and Apple as they are competitors to Google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple were the first technology company to really get into controlling their own retail experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is factually incorrect. Gateway did this in the early and mid 90&rsquo;s.  Gateway sold Gateway computers, monitors and keyboards in their Gateway stores (not Dell, not Apple, not <span class="caps">IBM</span>, not HP just Gateway computers). Apple is not the first to do this.</p>
<p>OK, Google and Microsoft are obviously so inspired by Gateway&rsquo;s retail success that they feel that they should play in the same space&hellip;thanks for the correction.</p>
<p>Stores were invented eons ago. Nobody&rsquo;s stealing ideas or being inspired from anybody about this.</p>
<p>Just go have a drink and relax.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying Apple have a copyright on opening a retail store, but it was very unusual for a technology company to open a brand specific store when Apple started doing it. It was widely expected to fail, but has been a massive success for them.</p>
<p>The whole pop-up store concept has also provided a lot of inspiration for brands who who want to promote their goods in a unique way without the baggage of the old department stores.</p>
<p>Now, other technology companies see the benefits of doing it this way, controlling your brand image and distribution channel has a lot of benefits. It makes sense for companies to look at what their competition is doing and take inspiration from what works, that&rsquo;s how business operates in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t Sony have Sony Style stores (or whatever they called them) before Apple? Keep in mind that I may be mistaken about this one.</p>
<p>At least in Japan I&rsquo;m pretty sure they had those kind of stores quite a long time ago, before the Apple stores I think, I&rsquo;m not sure how widespread they were though. Maybe in Japan they were more about showing upcoming technology too, rather than just selling the range of their products.</p>
<p>Sony copied apple of the future.</p>
<p>Sony made a Time Machine, traveled to the future, copied Apple Stores.<br />
And in all this, they stole the design for the Time Machine from &hellip;&hellip;(gasp) Apple.</p>
<p>They still have some open today.</p>
<p>I still remember those cow-patterned boxes lol</p>
<p>Lol yeah that worked out really well. It was one of the main reasons why some people thought Apple was going to fail. If you ever walked into one of those old Gateway stores you&#8217;d have seen how much inspiration Apple took from them&#8230;none. About the only thing they shared in common were that they were both stores that sold tech stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About the only thing they shared in common were that they were both stores that sold tech stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;. right. That&rsquo;s what they do. They have their own images to sell, after all. Those <a href="http://9to5google.com/2013/02/15/to-get-products-into-more-hands-google-will-open-its-own-stores-by-the-end-of-the-year/">Chrome stores</a> look <strong>very</strong> Google-y. What&rsquo;s wrong with that?</p>
<p>I think one of the main reasons the Gateway stores failed is because you didn&rsquo;t really need them. Gateway was a major brand and was found everywhere. Their computers were incredibly easy to fix, and hardware nerds were a dime a dozen.</p>
<p>Apple has a different situation, and they&rsquo;ve played on that very nicely.</p>
<p>Google faces an entirely different problem than both of them, and I think this is more of a necessity for Google in order to educate customers and to let customers play with their hardware before purchasing.</p>
<p>The first tech company to have their own retail space? Have you ever heard of a company called <span class="caps">IBM</span>?</p>
<p>Yes, I know other technology companies has retail operations earlier, but in the last decade or so it has been Apple who has reinvented retailing for consumer technology with their retail stores.</p>
<p>The article at that well known Apple fanboy site 9to5 Google (linked to from the article above) discusses the Google move in the context of the apple retail stores:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently, Apple <span class="caps">CEO</span> Tim Cook told analysts that Apple Stores were more than just stores, they were the face of the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we would have been nearly as successful with iPad if it weren&rsquo;t for our stores. It gives Apple an incredible competitive advantage. Others have found out it&rsquo;s not so easy to replicate. We&rsquo;re going to continue to invest like crazy. The average store last year was over 50 million in revenue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Google may now understand that if it wants to roll out a whole new product category like Google Glass, it is going to have to dive into Retail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn&#8217;t reinvent anything, they went back to a traditional model and then fed people enough marketing BS to make them believe it was something new.</p>
<p>They did reinvent the way retail can work for a consumer technology company, no matter what you want to believe. The way those stores work is perfect and it was designed at leats in part to get around the problem that Google are trying to solve, how to get people to experience products in a favorable environment.</p>
<p>Why is is so hard to admit that Apple can do something innovative?</p>
<p>The further people get from Best Buy and the employees they hire that know nothing, the better.  I had one tell me that I had to buy the extended warranty on the tablet I bought because oil from my fingers would eventually get through the screen and destroy the touch sensors.  Needless to say, I didn&rsquo;t buy the extended warranty.</p>
<p>The same goes for both of your comments.</p>
<p>The Apple stores were actually based on the Gateway Country Stores of my childhood. So there is that.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right&hellip;. because apple doesn&rsquo;t sell laptops in their stores.</p>
<p>yep, they dont sell $299 laptops</p>
<p>Way to cherry pick.</p>
<p>the microsoft store doesn&rsquo;t either. It&rsquo;s all ultrabooks in there.</p>
<p>This is an odd move. They&rsquo;re going to be in the same position as MS where they&rsquo;ll mostly be selling another company&rsquo;s hardware. I don&rsquo;t see it being very successful.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that Google has no idea what to do with their money.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably less about selling a high volume of devices and more about establishing themselves in a retail area, which increase mindshare.</p>
<p>This. And having total control over their brand and how it is presented, ie. not is some dingy corner of a tired department store.</p>
<p>I could understand that angle but it&rsquo;s also a lot of money to spend in accomplishing this. Not only that but I would imagine that they would have to sell a lot  let&rsquo;s say Chromebooks and Nexus to make it profitable since they don&rsquo;t live on the huge profit margins that Apple has with each product sold.</p>
<p>True. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll start making higher margin devices? The Glass will be pretty unique and if it&rsquo;s popular they could charge a premium for it.</p>
<p>Even if it stays at the level of bluetooth headsets, there are still many people who wear them around.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re completely neglecting X products, Glass, or any other potential products.</p>
<p>Google makes their money on ad revenue though &#8211; they don&#8217;t depend on a high profit margin from their products. Not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>They can also sell Chromeboxes and Google TV sets, in addition to their Nexus and Chromebook line ups. They can also sell other devices that complement their services, just like Apple sells non-Apple branded printers and software.</p>
<p>I see it as being a bit different than Microsoft having physical locations, due to the fact that Google&rsquo;s current line of products (especially the Nexus line and eventually Google Glass) is a much more coherent line of devices. Microsoft stores seem a bit silly because Microsoft is really only known for it&rsquo;s Windows OS, Xbox and only sorta kinda Surface. While Google&rsquo;s products are made by other producers, they are still definitively Google where-as people don&rsquo;t think of things running Windows as being Microsoft in any way.</p>
<p>I think both companies want to be perceived more like Apple, as a brand that has hardware and software to offer.</p>
<p>I suppose it&rsquo;s a matter of opinion, but I feel the Google store would very much be like the Microsoft store. Google to date, does not manufacture any products. They&rsquo;ve used Samsung, Asus, LG, <span class="caps">HTC</span> and Acer to make their devices, much like Microsoft. Microsoft actually manufactures mice, keyboards, physical copies of Office/Windows Xbox, tablets, and their video game studios make video games. By comparison, Microsoft&rsquo;s store has a bit more relevance than Google, for now.</p>
<p>We know that Google is going to come out with mobile devices under Motorola and possibly even Chromebooks of their own. It&rsquo;s going to make sense.</p>
<p>While this may be true, what are the added benefits of incurring cost for physical stores? They can ship their Motorola phones to other stores and allow them to house their phones for far less. The same idea applies to their Chromebook as well. Why would a company designed around online advertisement invest in a physical location to sell products other companies already offer?</p>
<p>Because the Motorola X and Glass are going to offer bizarre UI features that will be best demonstrated by a trained employee. Plus, it will provide all the benefits of Apple stores (direct supply management, customer support, messaging control) and also serve as a personable place where people can associate Google with a face rather than an amorphous entity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google to date, does not manufacture any products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither does Apple.</p>
<p>Apple has and is about to start doing so again.  They only started outsourcing in the early 2000&rsquo;s.  They are also opening a plant again in the US for the mac mini.  This was even mentioned during the State of the Union.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not seeing how Google is any more of a hardware company than Microsoft at this point. Not even close. They don&#8217;t have anything as remotely as successful as Xbox. If anything, most of their hardware-related adventures have been complete failures.</p>
<p>&hellip;like the Nexus 7? And the Samsung Chromebook?</p>
<p>Google isn&rsquo;t in the hardware game. they want to spread google products far and wide. I get what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>I remember once Bill Gates was asked about rampant piracy in China. He responded (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing), &ldquo;If they&rsquo;re gonna pirate something, I&rsquo;d rather it be our products.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google needs branding and showroom awareness. they don&rsquo;t necessarily need to get into selling consumer electronic hardware.</p>
<p>The biggest roadblock to Google&rsquo;s success with this is having product in stock.</p>
<p>I think it is pretty clear that Google will be getting into hardware soon.  They don&rsquo;t really have a choice. The Android ecosystem will soon be closed and Samsung will venture off by themselves. Google knows this and is trying to get the pieces in place before it is too late!</p>
<p>Maybe then I can get the orb&hellip; for some reason, Google has cancelled my past two attempts at ordering one. Same credit card and same address that got me my Nexus 7 and then my Nexus 4. Gonna try <em>not</em> ordering via Chrome on my Nexus 4 when I get home to see if that&rsquo;s the culprit.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for Chicago</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll go to a much more populated place&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; like Kansas City</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re smart they would.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long thought that, while a Google store would certain have their products on site, to be truly Googley, it should be less of a store and more of a technology interaction space, like a fancy, computer/web-centric children&rsquo;s museum.</p>
<p>Like their supposed meeting rooms with hammocks and turned over row-boats.  I could see them just being awesome places for kids and enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>google opening up hackerspaces that happen to sell stuff?</p>
<p>I doubt it would make for a successful retail place, but that does sound awesome.</p>
<p>Hopefully they won&rsquo;t look as hideous as the one in the picture o.O</p>
<p>They should theme it after their online services.</p>
<p>Oh great, tons of google stores that are perpetually out of stock! lol</p>
<p>Just make sure and have Nexus phones in stock and i support the idea&hellip;</p>
<p>Walk into a Google store and you get tagged with a Bar Code</p>
<p>Surprise,  you are for sale!!!</p>
<p>You heard it here first folks, Google supports human trafficking and slavery.</p>
<p>Apparently they incite lunatic trolls as well.</p>
<p>Bar codes? At least be somewhat topical in your derision.  They&rsquo;d use a qr code.<br /><img title="privacy matters" src="http://goo.gl/KJCxh.qr" alt="privacy matters" /></p>
<p>i&rsquo;m tempted to scan it, but I&rsquo;m scared.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s for a CNet article, headlined &ldquo;Congress not happy with Apple&rsquo;s response on privacy concerns&rdquo;.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d use <span class="caps">NFC</span>.</p>
<p>This is wonderful news to me&hellip;.was just thinking a couple days ago how Google really needs a proper storefront to start unifying their hardware with their software business.</p>
<p>Google: Please give classes for people to show how good your service integration really can be&hellip;.oh, first, make your integration between services as good as it <em>should</em> be.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the problem? I have no issue with service integration.</p>
<p>Oh great just send me a message via Google. Not using Gtalk, or Google+, or Messenger, or Voice, just Gmail.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>I feel there are definitely better ways to do things&hellip;..I would love to see:</p>
<p>Google Drive host:</p>
<p>-My automatic Android phone backup<br />
-My pictures, so that when I put them in a photos directory in Google Drive it goes straight to Picasa/G+</p>
<p>-The ability to bring up Google Drive online and see all of this data in one clean view</p>
<p>**Ultimately, I feel there&rsquo;s a disconnect between Google services and Google Drive.  To entice the average user to move to cloud hosted files, they need to see a seamless experience like they experience on their computer.  Right now it&rsquo;s a cluster of Google drive, Google Play Music, Google+ Photos, and YouTube and no real connection between any of them.  I think they can do better to make it a unified experience&hellip;..</p>
<p>&hellip;..just as how I would love to see messaging be completely unified, as ammonkapow stated below.</p>
<p>I am passionate about this as I use the majority of their services, and do feel like they shine in the SaaS industry, but right now it feels like a kid on <span class="caps">ADD</span> with all of different portals.</p>
<p>Your phone and pictures (via Instant Upload) already get backed up to Google. Why would you want it counted toward your total space?</p>
<p>Great idea for Google. Maybe some X phones and product accessories too.</p>
<p>ugh, it just looks like a poorly designed froyo place.</p>
<p>&hellip; in Sweden.</p>
<p>And I bet you still wont be able to buy a Nexus..</p>
<p>Admitted google fan boy&#8230; Awesome! Hope they open one in Austin this year.</p>
<p>Well there goes my theory of a massive Google Fiber rollout which would double as Google stores.</p>
<p>That looks so ridiculously 90&rsquo;s tacky.</p>
<p>They only have four hardware products&hellip; and all their software products are.. online&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be one big.. empty.. store&hellip;</p>
<p>Still &ndash; maybe I&rsquo;ll finally be able to find an accessory for my Galaxy Nexus&hellip;.</p>
<p>They could sell a few Android devices, a few Chrome laptops, plus accessories and when Glass is released it could be the best way to sell those.</p>
<p>Few people will buy a new product like that without getting a feel for it, so selling through a retail channel that they control would make sense.</p>
<p>That depends. They have 4 different models of Chromebook, the Nexus 4, 7 and 10. They could also sell many different unlocked phones, owning Motorola could come in handy there. There&rsquo;s also the Google Glass mentioned in the article. The Apple store is essentially. phones, tablets and Macs. A Google Store could have the same product mix.</p>
<p>I think they should just be showrooms with a lot of tech &ndash; a lot of google WIPs so tat people can get a glimpse at the future.</p>
<p>They need to reinforce their brand on a grassroots level and retail showrooms might be helpful.</p>
<p>Samsung is actually killing them in mobile &ndash; to the point where Samsung is synonymous with Android as opposed to Google. This is a problem for them.</p>
<p>Microsoft has a similar problem of course.</p>
<p>Showrooms have been tried.  They tend to not work if you cannot buy anything there.</p>
<p>Google should just buy RadioShack.  The company is tanking so they could acquire it cheap and they&rsquo;re located everywhere, so google would have a strong retail presence.</p>
<p>All the Radioshacks in my area aren&rsquo;t necessarily located in prime locations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see Radio Shack fade away. They exist to over charge you for replacement power cords.</p>
<p>But what about when you need batteries on Christmas Day?  :(</p>
<p>Maybe they could buy it relatively cheaply, but transforming a huge number of existing retail outlets with existing employees and contractual obligations into brand new stores would be very expensive.</p>
<p>that wouldn&rsquo;t be as cheap as you infer.</p>
<p>So following their model of &ldquo;success&rdquo; with Android, they&rsquo;ll build 10000 stores, make zero profit, and be declared the winner in retail right?</p>
<p>I doubt Android is as unsuccessful as you claim. Anyway, there&rsquo;s certainly about to be an onslaught of Google products with Motorola, Glass, Chromebooks, etc.</p>
<p>Google don&rsquo;t make any money directly from Android. Samsung seem to be the only company really making money from that OS.</p>
<p>But Google do make a lot of money displaying ads on all platforms.</p>
<p>this is hogwash. youre mixing up the aosp with google android. oems pay for googles services, google takes massive cuts from the play store + entrance fees. with android growing in popularity the eco system will print money for them.</p>
<p>what you mean is, aosp is for free, thank goodness, and a few of their apps have ads, like youtube. most still dont (gmail, gtalk, gplus, gmessenger, currents, vids, play, books, music, goggles, translate, drive, chrome, gnow, etc.)</p>
<p>Remember they want people to browse the web. They make money from mobile ads on the web.</p>
<p>of course they want that- but they do not create android so that people can browse the web and humpty dumpty bump into their ads. (-:</p>
<p>Google make hardly any money from Android directly, almost all their revenue is from advertising. The Play store does make them some money, but not much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the other revenues from Android? What other revenues from Android? Google Play is, from what I can see, the only way Google makes money off Android. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not nothing, but it can&rsquo;t be a huge money maker for Google. I&rsquo;m no finance expert, but from the actual <span class="caps">SEC</span> filing Thursday, I think Google Play revenues&mdash;Google&rsquo;s cut from app sales&mdash;must be mixed into the &ldquo;Other Revenues&rdquo; line, which totals $1.525 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, which is a little over 4% of consolidated revenues.<br /><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/android-a-bad-deal-for-google/240009359" target="_blank">http://www.informationweek.com/android-a-bad-deal-for-google/240009359</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>most still dont (gmail, gtalk, gplus, gmessenger, currents, vids, play, books, music, goggles, translate, drive, chrome, gnow, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use a lot of those, but Gmail definitely has ads, and they are very prominent in the Google Search interface, to the point of annoyance for me.</p>
<p>If they sell the devices themselves, there&rsquo;s no reason why they can&rsquo;t make a profit on their own phones. Just needs advertisement.</p>
<p>your point was that google created android to sell ads, because supposedly they do not otherwise make any income from it.</p>
<p>gmail has no apps. in fact most gapps have no ads.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://android-emotions.com/wp-content/flagallery/google-nexus-10-interface/google-nexus-10-gmail.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>or i must be blind and i see them not&hellip;.</p>
<p>Android drives profit in google ads.</p>
<p>Android will make them $5 billion this year:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3005821/fast-feed/tablet-ads-earn-google-5-billion-2013-alone" target="_blank">http://www.fastcompany.com/3005821/fast-feed/tablet-ads-earn-google-5-billion-2013-alone</a></p>
<p>No, that article says that displaying ads on tablet devices will bring in $5 Billion Revenue, doesn&rsquo;t mention Android at all, and you can be sure that a large chunk of that revenue is from ads displayed on iPads.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Google is paying Apple $1 Billion for them to default to Google as the search, as the article mentions.</p>
<p>there are many definitions of success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll assume you haven&rsquo;t made Mark Zuckerberg money. Does that mean you&rsquo;re a failure?</p>
<p>That was so funny it&rsquo;s not even funny.</p>
<p>Awesome! Hope they open one in Berlin!</p>
<p>This was inevitable. But if they are serious about this they will need to spread them pretty fast in US and around the world. If it takes them 10 years to open 100 stores, then that&rsquo;s not very good&hellip;</p>
<p>Imagine the insanity of having an Apple Store, Microsoft Store, and a Google Store in the same mall (ideally, right across from each other)&hellip;</p>
<p>Why would that be insane?</p>
<p>That would probably make a lot more sense for all those companies than having all their devices displayed on a rack at Best Buy or whatever and a teenager recommending the device based on how much commission he/she will get from the transaction.</p>
<p>He may mean insanely awesome!</p>
<p>The insanity rests with Microsoft and Google they won&rsquo;t make any money at all.</p>
<p>Just like Apple won&rsquo;t make any money on retail at all&hellip;.oh wait.</p>
<p>I would want fanboys grilling each other as they loiter before the temples of their respective corporate gods.</p>
<p>It would be tense, and security guards on Segways would have to make frequent drive-bys to keep the nerds from doing impromptu drop tests to determine once and for all whose glass is truly gorilla.</p>
<p>I think buying out Radioshack locations would be their best case scenario to get their foot in the market. <span class="caps">BUT</span>, what they really need is customer service.</p>
<p>Google stores could be interesting but I question the long term viability of the venture. Google doesn&rsquo;t have the best reputation when it comes to customer service or availability of devices. Retail is an entirely different way of doing business and it&rsquo;s very competitive. I hope they start out slow and put proven people in charge of establishing their brand. The funny thing is &ldquo;success&rdquo; in retail for Google may involve just breaking even if it means they build awareness of their ecosystem. Unlike most retailers Google doesn&rsquo;t really need to make the stores profitable.</p>
<p>Power to you, google.</p>
<p>cool. looks like playschool.</p>
<p>Good idea to get physical presence. Trying something in person is always a great way for me to decide what to buy. I&rsquo;d really love if each store has a Fiber Experience section. They&rsquo;d have to simulate the gigabit connection but it would get the point across.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;d have to simulate the gigabit connection</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Connect to the internet and the employee leans over your shoulder and tell you how much faster it would be if it was Fiber?</p>
<p>Or show a video of a download bar moving really quickly?</p>
<p>This is some huge stuff. Google really needs to get hands on with the customer. A lot more people will buy the products if they can play with it. I realise that this news wasn&rsquo;t big enough to be front and center of the verge&hellip; How typical that they hide some Google/Android news deep down in the bowels of the website where some people will never go.</p>
<p>I hope they are not squared since apple has a patent on that.</p>
<p>It looks like a damn daycare center with those ridiculous kiddy chairs</p>

<p>Gotta wonder how Samesung will react to Google stores&#8230; They&#8217;re already copying Ap&#8230;. Er I mean opening their  completely unique looking  retail stores&#8230;</p>
<p>Why would they have any reaction? It won&rsquo;t affect them at all.</p>

<p>The thing looks like it was designed by Fischer-Price.</p>
<p>Apple Stores are starting to become like Walmart. Way too many people who have no idea why they are even there to begin with.</p>
<p>Sony, Microsoft and Google all need to start expanding their retail stores.</p>
<p>I gather you have never set foot inside neither an Apple store nor a Walmart, based on your keen observation&#8230;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re there for salad dressing.  Right?  Right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Way too many people who have no idea why they are even there to begin with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s the whole point of the store. Try to draw as many people as possible long enough to be goaded into buying something they didn&rsquo;t really want.</p>
<p>I dunno, I was wrong about the Apple stores and they turned out to be blockbusters&hellip;.</p>
<p>But, I see this as a mistake, they&rsquo;re already alienating manufacturers with the Nexus products, this may be the end game for Google, to actually become a serious retailer of Google branded products, and screw the members of the <span class="caps">OHA</span>.</p>
<p>If I was in charge of Google, it&rsquo;s what I would do though, promote Motorola and Google devices.  Heck, I&rsquo;d kill Moto as a brand and rename it Google.  Stop the internal firewall crap and go for serious retail sales under the Google brand.</p>
<p> I think Google&rsquo;s biggest worry with Android is the 800Lb Gorilla named Samsung which dominates Android profitability.</p>
<p>Google are in danger of losing their control to Samsung, who will gradually take over Android if they&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
<p>Samsung can&rsquo;t take over Android, as it is Google which owns it. Ultimately they dictate the direction it takes. What Samsung seems to be doing is trying to transfer their brand recognition over to their own proprietary OS; whether it will prove successful remains to be seen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no reason why Google can&rsquo;t do with Motorola/Android what Samsung did.</p>
<p>Because Google has done so much with Motorola.</p>
<p>Also Android is open source&hellip; Samsung can do, almost, what they please with it&hellip; they could do exactly what Amazon did, make it their own with their own app store even.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ultimately they dictate the direction it takes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is it Open Source or do Google control it? It&rsquo;s a little bit of both actually. The core code is open, as Amazon have shown, but the branding and the most important apps are Google&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Samsung are spending billions advertising and making billions selling their Android flavoured devices. They are obviously using the Android name, but Samsung is becoming synonymous with Android in many people&rsquo;s minds, and is probably a more recognised name for the average consumer.</p>
<p>If Samsung felt that it was in their interests to do so, the could quite easily fork Android and create Android compatibel devices but where the OS is controlled entirely by them. Will they? I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Dear Google</p>
<p>Colors work differently in retail environments than they do on websites (unless your market is children).</p>
<p>Why follow what Apple has been doing? Why not go one step further and let me borrow the Chromebook for a week? Take out some insurance to cover the losses incurred from those that do not return it. (Even if some are stolen, you still have yourself a customer. Or you can disable it over the internet and decrease such incidents.)</p>
<p>How about a pay-as-you-go model? There are a lot of future customers that don&rsquo;t want to pay $400. Maybe $19 a month is more attractive for them. Tell them it comes with a free email address, free online storage, free word processors and such. (No I&rsquo;m not kidding. There are a lot of people that are clueless about this sort of thing.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point in trying to follow in Apple&rsquo;s footsteps. Why not <em>take the moonshot</em> and appl-y it to this new venture?</p>
<p>Think different.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Your competitor</p>
<p>To be fair, Apple followed in Gateway&rsquo;s steps with the retail locations.</p>
<p>When&rsquo;s the last time you&rsquo;ve seen a Gateway Country Store&hellip; if you&rsquo;ve ever seen one?</p>
<p>The point is, this isn&rsquo;t Apple&rsquo;s model. Retail is retail. Some companies will succeed at it. Some will fail.</p>
<p>Let you <span class="caps">BORROW</span> a chromebook? <span class="caps">LOL</span>. <span class="caps">WOW</span>.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;"Let you <span class="caps">BORROW</span> a chromebook? <span class="caps">LOL</span>. <span class="caps">WOW</span>.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>We could have said the same thing with the practice of putting all the products on the table and letting anyone play with them. (Not that Apple came up with this idea. But they certainly popularized it. Now everyone does it.)</p>
<p>Trying it out for a week isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing. Potential customers may think, &ldquo;I only have one week so I&rsquo;m going to try to use it as much as possible.&rdquo; Hopefully by that time, they&rsquo;re hooked.</p>
<p>Apple kind of one upped it with the open/free wi-fi at all the stores early on.  But really what Apple did was take all the bits and pieces others did and combined them in a non-halfassed way.</p>
<p>apple sells &ldquo;premium&rdquo; products. part of what makes apple stores so successful&hellip; <span class="caps">MARGINS</span>.</p>
<p>there are no margins on chromebooks.</p>
<p>Chromebooks cost nothing. a 14 year old can buy one with what he makes on his weekend job. you don&rsquo;t showroom around that customer and you don&rsquo;t do dedicated retail around that customer. Google&rsquo;s problem isn&rsquo;t convincing people to use their products.</p>
<p>A couple of things: this suggests that google might go deeper into hardware. A TV product, nexus phones and tablets, a nexus chromebook &ndash; Motorola&hellip;. they have a small portfolio that you can show off in a retail showroom.</p>
<p>Google needs to become better at being a forward facing company. Right now they&rsquo;re primarily a B2B and they have very poor brand messaging. I can see these retail spaces being innovative no-pressure showroom spaces showing off the present and future of google. Sort of mid-to-long term advertising installations if you will. With people lounging &ndash; playing with things&hellip; Google Geeks being really informative about google products and instructing people on how to get the most out of them.</p>
<p>Investing time, energy, and effort into lending out chromebooks is juice not worth the squeeze.</p>
<p>Selling expensive hardware is not what makes Apple Stores successful&hellip;<span class="caps">ANYBODY</span> can sell expensive products. They key is selling people on the entire experience. If Google can convince people that the way they envision their products to be used is a pleasant one, they will have plenty more problems keeping anything in stock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>part of what makes apple stores so successful&hellip; <span class="caps">MARGINS</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the use of the word &ldquo;<span class="caps">PART</span>&rdquo; and restate your assumptions.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with Android users?  These stores look like they are designed for children.  Looks like a play area at Burger King.</p>
<p>I hate it when I&rsquo;m shopping somewhere and there are a lot of colors&hellip;.. Don&rsquo;t they know that adults such as myself only take these establishments seriously if they coat everything in a cliche coat of beige?</p>
<p>I cannot be seen spending money in a store with bright colors. All the <del>kids</del> people at <del>school</del> work would laugh at me.</p>
<p><img title="pot meet kettle" src="http://theapplecollection.com/iMac/images/color-imacs.jpg" alt="pot meet kettle" /></p>
<p>The store look kind of reminds me of duplo blocks.  I am a little skeptical because Google still has not shown themselves to be any good at dealing with customers.</p>
<p>that looks like a chromebook section of a best buy store.</p>
<p>They have chromebook sections?  I&rsquo;ve not stepped foot in a Best Buy in about 3 years.</p>
<p>Yes they do.</p>
<p>Wow. I wonder if my local BB even has a Surface on display yet.</p>
<p>If Google wanted to sell more products, they&rsquo;d just make them available online internationally, and improve availability in the US. Physical stores are entirely unnecessary.</p>
<p>Physical locations play an important role imho.  Look at the Apple Stores.  You can touch and use the devices, get service right there, take classes, ask questions.  Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power physical interaction has.</p>
<p>Google does need to improve their online presence as well but the two are not exclusive imho.</p>
<p>No, Google needs to improve availability of their products; there&rsquo;s no problem with desirability. Physical stores are a solution in need of a problem.</p>
<p>This makes sense to me if they open one or two of these stores wherever they are offering Google Fiber.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re telling me that Google is going to run a store where the items are always in stock, I&rsquo;m all for it!!! I can finally get a Chromebook!</p>
<p>I imagine they&rsquo;ll build off of their tremendous success in customer service/support.<br />
Oh wait&hellip;<br />
I guess they&rsquo;ll just direct customers to workshops where a <em>group</em> of users just try to help each other.</p>
<p>Sweet, how do I get a job working here?</p>
<p>How about opening these stores in the neighborhood of Apple Stores? Would be interesting to see two giants head-on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some space near the Microsoft stores&hellip;</p>
<p>Well hopefully their ripoff of the Apple Store wont be as blatant as the Microsoft Store. Those fools even used the same ID badges, desks, and flooring. Last time I walked by the Microsoft store I went in and asked them where the iPads are. When they schooled me like the idiot customer I am, I said, &ldquo;Are you sure this isnt the Apple Store? You&rsquo;re positive on that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh ok, well thats why they call you guys the geniuses!&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Each product will have a little note next to it that reads &lsquo;Out of Stock&rsquo; followed by photos of each device&rsquo;s accessories as placeholders because the real ones won&rsquo;t be made for another 6 months.</li>
</ul>
<p>So basically Google is opening a showroom&hellip;&hellip; man, BestBuy is not going to like this.</p>
<p>Hopefully they don&rsquo;t just copy Apple like Microsoft did. If so, then I may check one out if Chromebooks become more mature and Glasses become a reality&hellip; and i&rsquo;m living in a fantasy land that has a proper Apple or Google store&hellip;</p>
<p>This is actually quiet impressive.  Looks like i&#8217;ve seen similar imagery in a movie- the new Dark Knight, Batman?</p>
<p>So where can I order?</p>
<p>Absolutely amazing. Is there a way to magnify the light in to a small high temperature solar panel to boost energy? Or is there a limit in efficiency as of today?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the orb is 3 feet in diameter based on the photo at the end of my post. If the density of glass is 2520 kg/m^3, then that orb weighs approximately 2225 lbs with the appropriate conversions.<br />
<img src="http://www.designboom.com/weblog/images/images_2/rodrigo/august/andreRawlemon/ball_10.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not to mention the cost of producing an optical grade 3 ft. diameter glass sphere.</p>
<p>or around 1 t for us SI guys</p>
<p>Good lord</p>
<p>what if its only a glass shell that are filled with a liquid that have the same IOR</p>
<p>still heavy as hell. cheaper to make maybe. but at least it could then be filled at the site.</p>
<p>the idea isn&#8217;t really that novel.. but if he has idea how to actually produce it on the cheap, then that&#8217;s different.</p>
<p>It is filled with water.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a big marble.</p>
<p>I remember seeing something similar but on a micro scale so  as to eliminate the need for Huge  balls like this :-) something like the following<br />
<a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address=115x82433" target="_blank">http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=115&#215;82433</a></p>
<p>Looking at this conference room:</p>
<p>Am I the only one thinking about <strong>burning ants with magnifying glasses</strong>?</p>
<p>In this case the casualties would probably be some Marketing Execs though&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>the casualties would probably be some Marketing Execs</blockquote>
<p>So much classier than using an ED-209.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier to use a curved mirror?</p>
<p>Probably not. The liquid medium acts as a better diffusor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by that?</p>
<p>Brainfart on my part. For some reason I thought they were using the spheres to make nice diffuse lights.</p>
<p>yes.</p>
<p>YES! It&#8217;s like MYST in real life!</p>
<p>I am able to create those in mass effect</p>
<p>Someone please tell James Bond to not destroy it.</p>
<p>I remember seeing a similar project in Brazil I think, though on a far smaller scale. They filled water bottles with water and  set them into roofs to provide diffuse lightning.</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s just as  a light-bulb substitute, to get light indoors (right?), this is about collecting solar energy.</p>
<p>The project in Brazil was called &#8220;Liter of Light&#8221; and it&#8217;s not about concentrate sunlight: recycle plastic bottles are filled with water and bleach and thanks to a chemical (I think but anyway I don&#8217;t know which) reaction they can bring light inside houses/favelas as powerful as a 50/60 Watt light bulb</p>
<p>These and solar panels. &gt;</p>
<p><strong>This is my next</strong> pair of glasses!</p>
<p>I would so pay loads of money for this!  :)</p>
<p>This sounds pretty damn cool, but one would hope the WIP device they release to the masses as the final product won&#8217;t blind anyone.</p>
<p>Contacts please, but YES finally.  Been waiting for some tech like this since Terminator-2.</p>
<p>The contacts are coming. At this point, it&#8217;s mostly trying to miniaturize the electronics necessary.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting for that stuff for a long time, too. That&#8217;ll do great until they come out with eyeball replacements <b>which I will immediately sign up for</b>.</p>
<p>Why not go a step further an tap directly into your visual cortex? Too invasive? ;)</p>
<p>The downside is that I don&#8217;t think the tech is there to make these look like a regular pair of glasses (presumably the goal). They&#8217;ll probably end up looking ridiculous like the gaga Polaroid glasses.</p>
<p>Worth it.</p>
<p>Good thing thick rim glasses are in style right now.  The timing couldn&#8217;t be better.  ;o)</p>
<p>How logical would it be to put a radio on your head for several hours?</p>
<p>Yeah, I for one wouldn&#8217;t much care for having active radio signals that close to my skull for extended periods.</p>
<p>They say prolonged radio signal exposure on your head can cause brain cancer. How true?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just wear it two hours at a time to write my exams.</p>
<p>Shut up and take my money!</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s nearly time to throw money at our screens again.</p>
<p>So subtle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take those ridiculous things OFF!&#8221;</p>
<p>#sixteencandles</p>
<p>I would get these in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><img src="http://gifs.gifbin.com/052011/1306235605_men_in_black_putting_on_glasses_fail.gif" /></p>
<p>Sounds awesome as long as you manage to get them on.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Hipsters now have a reason to wear seemingly useless glasses now.</p>
<p>If this leads to a Terminator-esque vision of the future then you can count me in! :D</p>
<p>Google wants you to be a Superman while still looking like Clark Kent.</p>
<p>Maybe they&#8217;re using <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/13/heads-up-lumus-shows-off-720p-see-through-video-glasses/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29" target="new">these </a>bad boys. <br />
(720p, See-Through Video Glasses)</p>
<p>What would be the point in wearing them again?  I&#8217;m interested in knowing when we would use them.  While studying, while in public, while driving, while at work.. when?</p>
<p>Also I think any hardware made by Google like glasses would require an Android phone (kept in pocket) for the processing.</p>
<p>point of wearing? easy, augmented reality (AR).  overlay data for near by places, overlay navigation via google maps. realtime public twitter feeds or local place finding. could be annoying if not done well but could be very powerful. one could perhaps remove the display part from your phone and use the glasses to display GUI.  You could control phone like a normal touchscreen and at same time save major battery life by not having a lcd running on the phone/base part.</p>
<p>oh yea, and they can help you see if you need glasses ;)</p>
<p>just my .02..</p>
<p>And the best part is playing games by using the glasses.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;swill be so much better.</p>
<p>I respect your opinion</p>
<p>Just wait until we&#8217;re talking about glasses marketshare like smartphone marketshare.</p>
<p><strong>cough</strong> cancer <strong>cough</strong></p>
<p>also, low amounts of radiation tend to dull out your thinking patterns :-)</p>
<p>This thread has been invaded by psuedoscientists.</p>
<p>Has anyone here made the connection to the glasses in Daniel Suarez&#8217;s awesome book &#8220;Daemon&#8221;?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for this to happen.</p>
<p>Surely more like the glasses in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Light">virtual light</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what this sounds like to me.</p>
<p>Are these legal to wear while driving?</p>
<p>They will be, for about seven seconds after they are released.  I&#8217;m sure the TOS you have to manually accept when installing the phone software will explicitly state that they are, under no circumstances, to be worn while driving.  The litigation potential here is outrageous, and Google&#8217;s legal team isn&#8217;t staffed by idiots.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much the first thing I thought of, too.  Google goggles are a novel concept, but somebody&#8217;s gonna mess up. Bad.</p>
<p>An idea that a bajillion times better than 3D glasses.</p>
<p>Well, technically, they still are 3D glasses, just of the active projection variety.</p>
<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4782567057_e7e6f9d63b.jpg" /> <br />
Next Step</p>
<p>Sounds super cool, but there&#8217;s so much detail missing from this news, it&#8217;s hard to get too excited. Primarily, how exactly is this supposed to work? How will this HUD know what I want to see at a given moment? How can a handful of dedicated buttons tell these glasses that I want to use Google Maps to figure out what trains will take me from Union Square to Lincoln Center? There&#8217;s a huge middle step missing here between the desire of the user and the end result display on the glasses that takes this out of the realm of sci-fi and into reality. This article also says it&#8217;s coming out of the Google X labs, so isn&#8217;t it likely &#8220;prototype&#8221; means something entirely different to them?</p>
<p>A very valid point about the interface. I think that other than using the few buttons to filter specific categories, (entertainment, travel, dining, factoid, etc) I think we could see a Siri like voice control. It may be a little creepy to see someone talking to himself without even a Bluetooth headset in but it could work assuming the software is designed to interact that way.</p>
<p>Voice command seems to have come a long way. It may just be at the point where it is powerful enough to pull off this kind of control</p>

<p>I am the only one who thinks this sounds super crazy?</p>
<p>No it <strong>is</strong> crazy.</p>
<p>So you can look forward to everyone you talk to periodically unfocusing their pupils and adopting a slack-jawed constipation-like facial expression as they ignore you to check their tweets.</p>
<p>Just wait until scientists find out how to redirect all of your motor impulses into a cybernetic surrogate. You&#8217;ll be slack-everything in a pod!</p>
<p>Google Rose-coloured glasses. See what they want you to see.</p>
<p>I would replace my glasses with these. If&#8230;..I&#8230;&#8230;had&#8230;.the&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.money.</p>
<p>No interface, just ads.</p>
<p>Game on ladies and gentleman.</p>
<p>Lets hope they unleash multiple Nexuses,  Nexii, etc&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>Also Nexus Q at 99$.</p>
<p>Unless they moved Nexus Q production to China, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see it at that price any time soon.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s pathetic how Google keeps trying to follow Microsoft and shadow every single big Windows Phone 8 event. First they copy the Lumia announcement event with their lame Motorola show, now they announce an event for WP8 launch day. For a company that is supposedly leading the mobile phone market it&#8217;s pathetic to see them so worried about a competitor with such a small share. It makes Google look really insecure and afraid that they are trying to steal the limelight from Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>That or they&#8217;re just following the &#8220;launch on the same day as the Mossberg/Andy Rubin Allthings Dinterview&#8221; thing they&#8217;ve been doing since the Nexus S.</p>
<p>Android event? Wont this just be a rehash of whatever Apple announced in September?</p>
<p>I think you have it backwards.  Based on the last couple of years I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a preview of what Apple will announce next September.</p>
<p>I only regret that I have but one recommend to give for this comment.</p>
<p>Very funny. Or I&#8217;m sure you think it is, anyway.</p>
<p>I love my iPhone 5&#8230;. But brainse&#8217;s comment was funny and true&#8230; Android is and will be ahead of the curve for years to come&#8230; Apple is ahead of the smartphone experience polish and will be for a long while.   I broke 3 iPhone 4&#8217;s got 2 free replacements from apple paid $160 for the third one. I work construction and my business revolves around my phone.  Don&#8217;t be a fanboy just be a fan.</p>
<p>So Project Butter, Nexus Q and Google Now is ahead of the curve? Is the curve just a circle?</p>

Both platform had thier security issuses.<br />

You don&#8217;t have to use them.<br />
<blockquote>less apps that work like shit</blockquote><br />
You don&#8217;t have to use them.<br />
<blockquote> less apps that were developed by thirteen year olds</blockquote><br />
No, it is good, that even a thirteen year old kid don&#8217;t have to spend his complete money to have the chance to build an app.<br />

There was only one overhaul&#8230;<br />
 <blockquote>iTunes</blockquote><br />
No need for iTunes.<br />

Oh, the FIRST point where I can agree, wow&#8230;and it is also the last one&#8230;<br />

It think you mean light as a feather, and Android, too<br />
<blockquote>  and etc etc etc.</blockquote><br />
So, somethink like: Open Source, Free Development Tools, Google Now, Asus Transformer, Flash, Alternatives to the System Apps  (like Firefox, K9Mail, etc.), Google Maps, no censorship, ,small devices, cheaper devices,  Widgets, Notifications, Alternative Stores for buying Apps, eBooks and Movies, etc etc etc.</p>
<blockquote>NFC, Navigation, Choice, HDMI out, Google Ecosystem, Downloading apps outside the store, USB charging and access, Bigger screens, etc etc etc….</blockquote>
<p>NFC, Choice (with regard to hardware), HDMI out, USB Charging, Bigger Screens are all hardware.</p>
<p>Android is not hardware. Furthermore, you can charge via USB.</p>
<p>That leaves:<br />
Google Ecosystem &#8211; arguably not quite as polished as iOS<br />
Downloading apps outside the store &#8211; why is this required?</p>
<p>Oh and I missed navigation.</p>
<p>Google are working on their iOS app, for most people Apple maps are fine, and there are numerous free navigation apps on iOS such as Waze. You also have maps.google.com.</p>
<blockquote> for most people Apple maps are fine</blockquote>
<p>for most people Google maps is excellent</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the one saying that there are issues with a particular version.</p>
<p>Android&#8217;s Google Maps app is commonly regarded as the best Maps and Navigation app in the industry, bar none.</p>
<p>I agree, but I maintain my original points:</p>
<blockquote>Google are working on their iOS app</blockquote>
<blockquote>You also have maps.google.com.</blockquote>
<blockquote> for most people Apple maps are fine</blockquote>
<p>To say that maps.google.com is as good of an experience as the Android Google Maps app is just ignorant</p>
<p>Feel free to quote my comment where I claimed that?</p>
<p>(Seriously, why can&#8217;t people in the internet read).</p>
<p>HDMI out and Google ecosystem?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to list Android pros, at least try to name areas that Apple doesn&#8217;t completely dominate.</p>
<p>In what way does apple &#8216;dominate&#8217; in ecosystem or HDMI???</p>
<p>Apple and Google have about the same no of apps and all the important ones are on both.</p>
<p>HDMI? Eh, I have a HDMI out on my tablet which I can directly plug in to the TV&#8230; WITHOUT proprietary cables or any other hardware.</p>
<p>It comes down to what you use your&#8217;s for, for me personally&#8230; apple just don&#8217;t match google&#8217;s offering.</p>
<p>Please explain what equivalent iOS has to Google Now.</p>
<p>Time waste to take anyone who names himself &#8220;1 Infinite Loop&#8221; serious. That guy is always the first in line in front of Apple stores when a new piece of iTrash comes available. Seen him posting nonsense under each article, specially under competitor-related articles.</p>
<blockquote>Seen him posting nonsense under each article</blockquote>
<p>And yet you don&#8217;t have enough facts to refute me? For shame! :P</p>
<p>I just busted your anti-Metro useless comment. Why did you post?</p>
<blockquote>Please explain what equivalent iOS has to Google Now.</blockquote>
<p>Siri. And yes, yes, Google Now has Cards. Get back to me when one of them becomes useful.</p>
<p>Sorry but even without taking cards into account, there is no competition between Google Now and Siri.</p>
<blockquote>there is no competition between Google Now and Siri.</blockquote>
<p>Feel free to provide evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re mixing up Google Now and Google Voice Search.<br />
Google Now doesn&#8217;t &#8220;have&#8221; cards, Google Now <strong>is</strong>  the cards.</p>
<p>I can confirm this, since I desactivated Now on my phone and I still have access to the voice interface. Google Now is a service that use your search history and your location (and location history) to come up with information that might be relevant to you, before you even ask. Nothing like Siri.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s own video explanation of Google Now includes the voice search capability.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed.<br />
Like their Chrome ad include Google+ sharing or Street View capabilities.<br />
Android had voice search capability long before Google Now.</p>
<p>Chrome is different because Chrome is deliberately a portal with which you access other content. Anything that you can access via Chrome isn&#8217;t a feature of Chrome, it&#8217;s just a way of demonstrating it.</p>
<p>Voice search doesn&#8217;t demonstrate Google Now, it&#8217;s <strong>part of it</strong>. Google Now as a concept is essentially a context aware system of organising information. Being able to specify verbal notes, reminders to be triggered when you reach a particular place is very much part of that.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is where Siri and Google Now are similar, because they are both context aware and can trigger reminders when you reach a particular place.</p>
<p>Voice search doesn&#8217;t do that. And by the way, Apple had voice search long before Siri, too.</p>
<p>On my Galaxy Nexus there&#8217;s no &#8220;Google Now&#8221; app&#8230; only a &#8220;Google&#8221; app.<br />
Voice Search and Google Now are two different and independant activities of this app, so Voice Search is not part of Google Now, and vice versa.<br />
I know why a lot of people and even some tech writers get confused about this, it&#8217;s because Voice Search and Google Now both use Google&#8217;s Knowledge Graph to present informations in cards.<br />
That confusion is understandable, and it&#8217;s only to make it clear that I replied to you.</p>
<p>Of course Voice Search doesn&#8217;t do that, it&#8217;s not part of Google Now. ;)</p>
<p>Pretty bored of this argument, but:</p>
<blockquote>Of course Voice Search doesn’t do that, it’s not part of Google Now. ;)</blockquote>
<p>It DOES do that in Google Now. Thus we can say that Google Now doesn&#8217;t simply &#8216;incorporate&#8217; Voice Search, part of the functionality of the Voice Search in Google Now is part of what Google Now is. Meaning that Google Now isn&#8217;t just a series of cards, which has been my point.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, Voice Search is a big part of Google Now. I know that most of Google Now is the cards, and I&#8217;ve said all along the iOS app doesn&#8217;t have this, but iOS does have the Voice Search elements.</p>
<p>It sounds like you didn&#8217;t read my comment.<br />
As you answered me in another post, the app is not &#8220;Google Now&#8221; but &#8220;Google Search.&#8221;<br />
A lot of people, even tech blogs writers, tend to mix up those things. What some of them call Google Now is actually Google Search.</p>
<p>Let me explain it again to you:<br />
Google recently announced <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html" target="new">Knowledge Graph</a>, it displays a card with a summary of most important informations about your search query.<br />
This is not linked to a mobile app, it&#8217;s available on any device and any browser, on the right side of Google.com results pages.</p>
<p>Then they brought it to their Google Search mobile app by:<br />
- Updating the Voice Search feature with cards and spoken answers.<br />
- Creating a brand new independent feature, called Google Now, that automatically displays contextual informations in cards, in the Knowledge Graph style, and doesn&#8217;t need nor allow any kind of voice interaction.</p>
<p>So whether you like it or not, Google Voice Search is not a part of Google Now, they&#8217;re both part of Google Search.<br />
Yes, iOS has Voice Search.<br />
No, it doesn&#8217;t have Google Now.</p>
<blockquote>Yes, iOS has Voice Search.<br />
No, it doesn’t have Google Now.</blockquote>
<p>They are not distinct, for the reasons I most clearly explained in my previous post.</p>
<p>Part of Google now is the contextual awareness of Google Search.</p>
<p>It has Google Now minus the cards, as I said all along. All your long rant does it talk about how the cards are separate.</p>
<p>If you remove the voice search from google now, you could still use it exactly as it is. The voice only allows you to put the input in via voice rather than typing. Google now is not the same as the voice search.</p>
<p>Anyways&#8230; I dont really care just thought i&#8217;d add my comments :)</p>
<p>They are distinct.</p>
<p>Almost all Google services have had &#8220;contextual awareness&#8221; for quite a while.<br />
Maps, Latitude, Google+&#8230; even the <strong>desktop</strong> version of voice search:<br />
<a href="http://s7.postimage.org/shxjzjior/Desktop_voice_search.png" target="new"><img src="http://s7.postimage.org/shxjzjior/Desktop_voice_search.png" /></a><br />
(you can click on all images to see it better)</p>
<p>All these services, though they have &#8220;contextual awareness,&#8221; have nothing to do with Google Now, which is only available on mobile devices.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t keep on denying facts eternally&#8230;<br />
Look at that screenshot of the Android&#8217;s Google Search app:</p>
<p><a href="http://s8.postimage.org/h3y2ari1x/Screenshot_2012_10_19_11_36_49.png" target="new"><img src="http://s8.postimage.org/h3y2ari1x/Screenshot_2012_10_19_11_36_49.png" /></a></p>
<p>You can see the search section in the upper part, with text and voice features, and the Google Now section below (it&#8217;s easily recognizable: it&#8217;s the part that is absent of the iOS version of Google Search).</p>
<p>Now take a look at these screenshots of the settings of Android&#8217;s Google Search:</p>
<p><a href="http://s8.postimage.org/6ie6yrbqd/Screenshot_2012_10_19_11_38_28.png" target="new"><img src="http://s8.postimage.org/6ie6yrbqd/Screenshot_2012_10_19_11_38_28.png" /></a><br />

<p>Do you have that on iOS? No you don&#8217;t, because it&#8217;s a <strong>distinct</strong> feature that&#8217;s <strong>not present</strong> in the iOS version.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go even further.<br />
Look at how I can turn off Google Now and still be able to use Voice Search, and how the app looks different then:</p>

<p>Google Now and Voice Search both have &#8220;contextual awareness,&#8221; Google Now and Voice Search both use Knowledge Graph style cards, but they&#8217;re two different and independant features that can be used without the other.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have Google Now on iOS.</strong></p>
<blockquote>Android had voice search capability long before Google Now.</blockquote>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t provide answers. It was just Voice Actions, fundamentally no different than Voice Control or TellMe (yes, yes, VA was first).</p>
<p>All three of them sucked because all three of them required syntax and that pretty much kills any simple voice control for the masses. Now only TellMe sucks. :P</p>
<p>Technically, all language requires syntax.  You can&#8217;t just stick verbs, nouns, etc in just any order and expect people to understand what you&#8217;re saying.  Well, you can, but to green jumped cowboy brightly.</p>
<blockquote>Technically, all language requires syntax.</blockquote>
<p>I mean commands that you have to learn and say exactly when I&#8217;m criticizing those three instead of speaking in a more natural way that includes flaws. &#8216;Play me some Ramones&#8217;.</p>
<p>Ah, it does? Just watched it and must&#8217;ve missed it. Still, it doesn&#8217;t matter. For all intents and purposes, Siri-like part of the voice recognition or whatever anyone wants to call it <em>is</em> Siri like and will be considered as part of Google Now, unless people decide to dig into the technical details.</p>
<p>Ok, you seem to be technically <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/">right</a>. &#8216;Technically&#8217; because from everything I&#8217;ve read about Google Now previously and using it myself, there&#8217;s no visible differentiation between Google Now and &#8216;Voice Actions&#8217;, if it is still called that.</p>
<p>My point still stands either way though (as I&#8217;ve said, the Cards are the most useless part of the equation until it gets better).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you that most of the cards are useless for my specific use case, but it&#8217;s pretty cool when my phone buzzes and I have a notification telling me to leave slightly early because traffic is backed up.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that the title of the event is &#8220;The playground is open&#8221; on a Google Now style background indicates they may be providing an API to the cards, in which case I expect Google Now to become a whole lot more interesting.</p>
<p>Not that this needs to be an Apple vs. Android pissing match, but given Apple&#8217;s tight control over it&#8217;s own products (which is often a good thing), it seems unlikely that they would take a similar step with Siri in the near future.</p>
<p>Well Apple already has taken some steps with restaurant dining, movie information, and sports scores on Siri.  I would imagine at some point they&#8217;ll have to open the API up to everyone. There&#8217;s just too much potential there not too.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been done in the &#8220;Apple way&#8221;. Pick what they think is best for the consumer and then decide for them. It&#8217;s an excellent way to start things off and to showcase the potential, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily indicative of them planning to open it up.</p>
<p>I agree that it makes sense to open it up. I just don&#8217;t see the current integration as an necessarily pointing in that direction.</p>
<p>Not trying to argue that your opinion isn&#8217;t valid, just trying to clarify mine.</p>
<p>Google Now is a predictive interface, Apple&#8217;s is not. That&#8217;s all you really need to know. But if you really want your phone to make witty comments back to you thats fine too</p>
<p>They are very useful already.  The traffic cards to common places I do and appointments on my calendars as well as reminder for when I need to leave by based on traffic.</p>
<p>That alone is a killer feature for someone who doesn&#8217;t sit in front of the PC commenting all day.</p>
<blockquote>The traffic cards to common places I do </blockquote>
<p>I search for various stores all of the time. Google Now gave me most or all of what I searched for with that card. I hated that. I didn&#8217;t want to go to most of those places.  (The fact that it syncs with desktop Chrome is very nice and futuristic though).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll get more useful and intelligent though for more people as time goes by.</p>
<blockquote>That alone is a killer feature for someone who doesn’t sit in front of the PC commenting all day.</blockquote>
<p>Mac, iPhone, and sometimes I go days without visiting, Mr. 793 posts and counting. ;)</p>
<p>The card was very useful for me last weekend. Me and my girl went shopping at a town an hour away and lost track of time. I heard my phone, checked, and saw that we needed to get going if we were going to make it back home in time to see Ron White&#8217;s bit. We would have been late or have completely missed it if it weren&#8217;t for that notification.</p>
<p>Considering I had to miss our last planned weekend due to work, I was very grateful for the feature. Saved me from having another ruined weekend with my girlfriend.</p>
<p>I also use Google Now to let her know about Cardinals games. She thought about getting an android phone but I talked her into getting the iPhone 5 since that&#8217;s what she knows and enjoys. My Nexus 7 is still sort of foreign to her. So I figured, why fix something that isn&#8217;t broke (also I&#8217;m not a fanboy)? She loves her iPhone but appreciates the features on my Nexus (because she&#8217;s not a fangirl). See how it&#8217;s done &#8220;1 Infinite Loop&#8221;?</p>
<blockquote>The card was very useful for me last weekend.</blockquote>
<p>The same feature the guy above mentioned. Any other unique features that have come in handy?</p>
<blockquote>I also use Google Now to let her know about Cardinals games.</blockquote>
<p>Are you talking about what Siri can do?</p>
<blockquote>See how it’s done "1 Infinite Loop"?</blockquote>
<p>See how what&#8217;s done? That you talked her into sticking with a certain phone? I don&#8217;t do that. I <strong>never</strong> do that. My advice is <strong>always</strong> to use whatever anyone likes and works for them. If it&#8217;s not good enough for you, then look for something else. I told a dev <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3436922/windows-phone-8-sdk-developers-secret-features#118830193">somewhere</a> on here a while back to stick with Microsoft until they had the Surface in hand and then see if it works for them, as opposed to switching all the way over into the Apple ecosystem because they were disappointed in Microsoft for some reason.</p>
<p>Such a thing would be stupid. This guy had invested thousands and seemingly his career in Windows. He should at least wait for Microsoft&#8217;s last chance, as I called it.</p>
<p>Sure I think Windows 8 on tablets is going to crash and burn, but that&#8217;s just my opinion. People should see whether or not something works for themselves. Which you seemingly didn&#8217;t do with your gf who was seemingly genuinely interested in Android over her iPhone.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#8217;t make assumptions if you&#8217;re not good at it. ;)</p>
<p>I think his point was that a more balanced response could show the positive <strong>and</strong> negative points for a given technology and therefore be more persuasive.</p>
<p>&#8230;but then we wouldn&#8217;t have as much fun.</p>
<p>I left out info in order to make the post shorter but the fact was her complaints with Apple were minimal and non-consequential to iOS as a whole. Her battery hadn&#8217;t been holding a charge over a couple of hours and was waiting for the new iPhone. I had mentioned that could have been easily solved if they would let you remove the back, but that she&#8217;d have to send it in. That idea apparently made her consider Android because of silly things like that (even though my Nexus has the same issue). Then she got aggravated with the long wait for the iPhone 5. The reason why I assured her to stick with Apple and to be patient was because she had spent hundreds of dollars on iTunes and every time I offered to rip the music so she could use another device she just said &#8220;nah, whatever&#8221;. She didn&#8217;t want to lose all of that obviously. Also the time she had spent with my Nexus 7 she seemed kind of lost and always wished it was as &#8220;simple&#8221; as her iPhone since that&#8217;s what she knows and loves. For her switching isn&#8217;t worth it as she has no interest in learning something new just to get around waiting a couple of weeks when she&#8217;s already waited months. I didn&#8217;t talk her into anything, more or less just assured her not to make a hasty decision based on aggravation.</p>
<p>My friend recently switched to Android and has the exact same story as my girlfriend. She hates it because it doesn&#8217;t work the way she thinks it should and she lost all her music from iTunes. I didn&#8217;t want my girlfriend to make the same mistake. My friend got talked into an Android phone by another friend of mine who like me dislikes many of Apple&#8217;s decisions. What is right for us is not right for all however, and most people simply don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>tl;dr: I didn&#8217;t talk her into it. I simply assured her that waiting a couple of weeks for the 5 was not a dumb decision but in fact was the most logical for her.</p>
<p>Also you&#8217;re the one who seems deadset on completely erasing the cards existence (by diminishing its importance) from Google Now just so you can consider Siri competitive.</p>
<p>I would never come to you for a reality check.</p>
<blockquote>Also you’re the one who seems deadset on completely erasing the cards existence (by diminishing its importance) from Google Now just so you can consider Siri competitive.</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve used Google Now for weeks. I didn&#8217;t find it helpful. It&#8217;s just a hint at what it can be. Like Siri and its conversational technology, which Google Now doesn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>This has always been my belief. I can provide a link to an old thread showing so if you want..</p>
<p>Also, question, does it show European footy teams if you&#8217;re in the US now? Just wondering. Could never get it to work for Barca FC.</p>
<p>I shall raise my hand and say that cards are useful for me.</p>
<p>Your argument is now invalid.</p>
<p>Just checked the address from where I&#8217;m meeting my gf on google maps. Card will be ready on my phone with navigation when I leave to meet her in a few hours.</p>
<p>It keeps track on my favorite football teams. Just got a card about Bayern Munchen&#8217;s next match.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just two useful cards I have gotten today. Sooo, not useless.</p>
<p>Get back to me when Siri becomes useful (It&#8217;s just a toy for lonely people).</p>
<p>The sports cards are very useful, as is the traffic/time to a location card.  Those were there from day one. Which card do you use and on which device do you use it?</p>
<blockquote>Please explain what equivalent iOS has to Google Now.</blockquote>
<p>Google Now (minus the cards) is available on iOS right now.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s basically saying &#8220;Google Now (minus Google Now) is available on iOS right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cards interface is Google Now, it&#8217;s a predictive service, based on your search history. Not a search engine, that is just called Google.</p>
<p>Google Now&#8217;s <a href="http://www.google.com/landing/now/" target="new">own promotional video</a> includes Google Search. The voice has also been known as &#8216;Google Now&#8217; for a long time now, refer to the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-adding-google-now-like-feature-to-ios-apps-2012-8" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/google-adding-google-now-like-feature-to-ios-apps-2012-8</a><br />
<a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/08/08/google-soon-adding-siri-google-now-like-functionality-to-its-ios-search-app/" target="_blank">http://9to5mac.com/2012/08/08/google-soon-adding-siri-google-now-like-functionality-to-its-ios-search-app/</a></p>
<p>Crucially &#8211; the Google Now available on iOS is contextually aware, so it&#8217;s not just straight search as you mistakenly make out.</p>
<p>Also, consider it a response to this previous comment:</p>
<blockquote>Sorry but even without taking cards into account, there is no competition between Google Now and Siri.</blockquote>
<p>The fact that they&#8217;ve integrated their own voice search functionality into the service still does not change the fact that Google Now is a predictive service, and is not<em> just</em> Google Voice search with a new name.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall ever saying it is &#8216;just&#8217; Google Voice.</p>
<p>I said that iOS has Google Now minus the cards.</p>
<p>What an absolute ridiculous statement. The cards is the main part of Google Now. You can&#8217;t just say it&#8217;s the same, as long as you remove the main part of one of the products.</p>
<p>1 &#8211; I didn&#8217;t say cards isn&#8217;t the main part.<br />
2 &#8211; I didn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s the same. I said it does everything apart from cards. I passed no comment on whether it&#8217;s the same or how important cards are.<br />
3 &#8211; Why do you think it&#8217;s incorrect to say that it&#8217;s the same bar X feature? It&#8217;s correct, however important X feature is, because I&#8217;ve explicitly stated that it doesn&#8217;t do feature X.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not correct is the name.<br />
To simplify matters, Google Now is precisely the feature that iOS doesn&#8217;t have, that you call &#8220;cards.&#8221;<br />
What you call Google Now is the Google Search app, with the Voice Search feature that also uses Knowledge Graph cards.</p>
<blockquote>What you call Google Now is the Google Search app,</blockquote>
<p>Erm, no. I haven&#8217;t said iOS has &#8216;Google Now&#8217;. I said it has &#8216;Google Now minus the cards&#8217;. The added condition clearly denotes a different set of features, the name is irrelevant anyway.</p>
<p>Then it doesn&#8217;t have google now!</p>
<p>Remove voice search from siri&#8230;. unusable.</p>
<p>Remove voice search from google now&#8230; still usable</p>
<p>No, the fact that you added &#8220;minus the cards&#8221; doesn&#8217;t make it right, iOS doesn&#8217;t have Google Now <strong>at all</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>Google Now is just the feature that shows informations and notifies you <strong>without you doing anything.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not &#8220;Google Now (minus the cards)&#8221; you should have said, but &#8220;Google Search (minus Google Now).&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>IOS doesn&#8217;t have Google Now.</strong></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the name of the iOS app?</p>
<p>Google Search.</p>
<p>Yep.<br />
It&#8217;s not the &#8220;Google Now&#8221; app.</p>
<p>Because that changes what it does?</p>
<p>Most ridiculous argument ever.</p>
<p>I never said there was an app called &#8216;Google Now&#8217;.</p>
<p>You keep on saying that Voice Search is a part of Google Now.<br />
That&#8217;s plain wrong.<br />
You&#8217;re mixing up the Google Search iOS app with the Android exclusive called Google Now.<br />
Google Now notificates and shows cards without you doing anything.<br />
There&#8217;s no trace of it in the Google Search iOS app: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ4mdrlWYM" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cZ4mdrlWYM</a><br />
Nothing in the title, nothing in the video, nothing in the description&#8230;</p>
<p>*exclusive feature<br />
*notifies</p>
<p>Thats not an apple product</p>
<p>Does that mean Apple users can&#8217;t use it?</p>
<p>Those are perfect examples. Google not only meets Apple but they go above and beyond them. Apple cannot realistically catch up to Android due to the open source nature of the programme.</p>
<blockquote>Google not only meets Apple but they go above and beyond them.</blockquote>
<p>So the Nexus Q isn&#8217;t $300 crap? Ok.</p>
<blockquote>Apple cannot realistically catch up to Android due to the open source nature of the programme.</blockquote>
<p>This is the most ridicolous thing I have read all week. You are obviously either new to tech or just naive.</p>
<p>1. In what world are you living in that Linux is better than OS X and Windows?</p>
<p>2. In what world are you living in where Google develops Android in an open manner? I.E. Google develops Android, <em>then</em> they release the source code. There are no kids in basements helping them out with new features.</p>
<p>3. Name the open source alternative that&#8217;s better than Photoshop or Final Cut Pro (X) or Gmail or Google.com or you get the idea?</p>
<p>1. Even as you speak, your comments are sent and kept on a Linux machine, instead of an OSX or Windows machine.</p>
<p>2. Really? Why don&#8217;t you dive into the source and send a few patches. Because AOSP receives about 100 independent contributions every month and almost half of them are merged into the master tree.</p>
<p>3. If Photoshop never existed, GIMP would be much better product than Photoshop now is.</p>
<blockquote>1. Even as you speak, your comments are sent and kept on a Linux machine, instead of an OSX or Windows machine.</blockquote>
<p>My fault. Let me rewrite what I said.</p>
<p><em>In what world are you living in that Linux is better than OS X and Windows for regular people who need to get shit done.</em></p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve used Linux for years, kid.</p>
<blockquote>Why don’t you dive into the source and send a few patches. </blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m talking features, not patches.</p>
<blockquote>Because AOSP receives about 100 independent</blockquote>
<p>That few? Wow.</p>
<blockquote>If Photoshop never existed, GIMP would be much better product than Photoshop now is.</blockquote>
<p>You really like making ridiculous comments, eh? Let me try my hand at one.</p>
<p><em>If Hitler had died, there would have never been a World War 2 either, I guess, as long as you ignore all the other pissed off Germans at the time.</em></p>
<p>Damnit, I&#8217;m too logical.</p>
<p>&#8216;If blank hadn&#8217;t had happened, then blank would&#8217;ve have happened&#8217; comments are usually stupid.</p>
<p>And if open source is as great as you proclaim it to be, then what&#8217;s stopping it from destroying alternative commercial projects across the board? Last time I checked, Linux was around before Windows solidified its monopoly. And is, um, still around today.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ you sound like a blind fanboy.</p>
<p>The fact that you defend a company blindly doesn&#8217;t make your ego better, Both iOS and Android have their own exclusive features and both lack some that the competitors have (But I must admit iOS lags a bit behind on the features list)</p>
<p>Linux systems can also be miles better than OS X and Windows over a wide gamut of things for getting stuff done, You just need to know how to use it properly</p>
<p>His name is 1 Infinite Loop. &#8220;Blind fanboy&#8221; about sums it up. You are wasting your time here.</p>

<p>Here and there. Gotta leave out by 1.</p>
<blockquote>Jesus Christ you sound like a blind fanboy.</blockquote>
<p>With facts on my side.</p>
<blockquote>The fact that you defend a company</blockquote>
<p>Defend what exactly? This specific thread is about open source vs commercial closed source. So technically I&#8217;m defending commercial closed source or more accurately logic and reason and capitalism.</p>
<blockquote>Linux systems can also be miles better than OS X and Windows over a wide gamut</blockquote>
<p>Servers, managing a network, web browsing (for security reasons), and easy updates. That&#8217;s not a wide gamut.</p>
<p>But feel free to list where else Linux beats Windows or OS X for mainstream users.</p>
<blockquote>Defend what exactly? This specific thread is about open source vs commercial closed source.</blockquote>
<p>dumbo, This specific thread is about Google&#8217;s announcement. <br />
Not open source vs commercial closed source.</p>
<blockquote>This specific thread is about Google’s announcement. </blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s about many things. Idiot. (If you&#8217;re going to insult someone, just insult them. No need to make it kid friendly.)</p>

<p>You got the hang of it!</p>
<blockquote>You are hijacking an android article</blockquote>
<p>Welcome to The Verge.</p>
<p>Or maybe you think that the only comments on an article should be filled with praise? I certainly don&#8217;t. And I know <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/12/3316830/iphone-5-release-date-specs-features-price-announcement/in/3081013">you don&#8217;t either</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and a reminder. This is my first reply in this thread. My reply was on topic with what I replied to. Everything else has sprouted from it. :P</p>
<blockquote>So Project Butter, Nexus Q and Google Now is ahead of the curve? Is the curve just a circle?</blockquote>
<p>I prefer thought over fanboys any day of the week. All fanboys ruin the ability for those who like tech not just brand X tech, to have intelligent discourse. You (fanboys) are the lowest common denominator of a public forum. It is a shame too because you seem to be marginally intelligent but you refuse to use it in a productive manner.</p>
<blockquote>I prefer thought over fanboys any day of the week.</blockquote>
<p>That makes no sense. Therefor I can only assume that you&#8217;re doing your best to string two words together and that reading the rest would be a waste of my time.</p>
<p>Good night. :)</p>
<p>Linux (in specific Ubuntu) has caught up to Windows and Mac a LOT, however it will never completely get there because it doesn&#8217;t have the commercial backing that the other OS&#8217;s get. Doesn&#8217;t mean open source isnt as good.</p>
<p>Look at:</p>
<p>Apache vs IIS<br />
PHP vs .NET</p>
<p>I know my preference &#8211; doesn&#8217;t always mean open source is better but it does normally mean (depending on the number of interested parties) that things get done faster and released faster.</p>
<p>It depends on what you are trying to get done. If you&#8217;re hosting a website, Linux gets shit done better than OSX and Windows. You never specifically said &#8220;as a desktop OS&#8221;.</p>
<p>Patch doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean something small or a bugfix. Any contribution to an open source project is a patch. You can add a significant feature to AOSP. But sure, it is unlikely that they will accept an implementation of something major from a single person. But OEMs contribute major features to Android.</p>
<p>The reason GIMP is worse than Photoshop isn&#8217;t because it is open source. Besides, GIMP is pretty good.</p>
<blockquote>You never specifically said "as a desktop OS".</blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s make something clear for future reference. I <strong>only</strong> care about consumer electronics.</p>
<blockquote>The reason GIMP is worse than Photoshop isn’t because it is open source.</blockquote>
<p>It <em>is</em> worse though because it only has kiddy money backing it.</p>
<p>My boss used a terrific phrase to describe Linux, &#8220;Linux is only free if my time is worthless&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let me guess you and your boss work at BestBuy? It would have to be some level of  lowly &#8220;tech&#8221;  to make a statement with so much ignorance, and to think it is terrific.  I guess there are many people who can&#8217;t see the tech landscape past their all-in-one computers.  Linux and open source has transformed the world and goes derided and misunderstood by most consumers.</p>
<p>How about LTE support, larger screens (16:9 aspect ratio) full HD?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit the iPhone has a lot more polish than most Android devices, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Android is usually first when it comes to implementing to technologies.</p>
<p>Those are hardware features.</p>
<p>Android is not hardware.</p>
<p>hardware using android</p>
<p>But the hardware is what is good in those points, not Android.</p>
<p>No Android phones have full HD. An unreleased model was revealed yesterday.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s hardware, not Android features.</p>
<blockquote>How about LTE support</blockquote>
<p>I think only one of those phones didn&#8217;t have crappy <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/13">battery</a> life on LTE.</p>
<blockquote>larger screens (16:9 aspect ratio)</blockquote>
<p>Yep.</p>
<blockquote>full HD?</blockquote>
<p>As important as the difference between 720p and 1080p to your grandpa.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right though. In hardware, Android OEMs are often first with some new technology <em>nowadays</em>. It&#8217;s their way of differentiating. But I think that being <em>better</em> is more important. And I rather <strong>wait</strong> for LTE with good battery life then use Smart Actions and various Rules to try to eek out decent battery life while also using 4g. ;)</p>
<p>You may gotten the idea that I think being first is important because of my reply to someone who obviously thought being first was important (going off memory here).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t. I believe that being the best all-around is important. And I love consistency.</p>
<p>People like &#8220;1 Infinite Loop&#8221; make reading Verge comment unbearable.</p>
<p>God, I know. I can&#8217;t stand it when people have differing opinions than I. Ughhh.</p>
<p>Nice try using sarcasm&#8230;.</p>
<p>Having differing opinions is different. Thrusting your opinion on others is &#8220;unbearable&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a single comment and was attacked for it. After that point he&#8217;s been defending his first point, and adding in a little sarcasm for good measure. It&#8217;s everyone else that are thrusting their opinions on him just because he isn&#8217;t agreeing with your premise.</p>
<p>A simple, &#8220;good point, but lets agree to disagree&#8221; would have prevented this entire conversation</p>
<p>What the removal of Google maps from Android? I don&#8217;t think so. LOL</p>
<p>Better reason why they are doing this: Talk about a way to screw WP8&#8217;s news status</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re worried. It&#8217;s the Nexus time of year. Which just so happens to be the same day Windows Phone 8 event is being held.</p>
<p>Right just a coincidence, well we&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s anymore lame insider jokes about Kin at this biggest event of the day. Hopefully the jokes not on the attendees again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure Google have had this planned for a while, since it&#8217;s more-or-less the same time they&#8217;ve used for previous Nexus announcements. But sure, they&#8217;re worried about WP8 if that&#8217;s what helps you sleep at night.</p>
<p>I know Nexus phones are usually unveiled in October, but the same exact day as the WP8 launch which has been known for a very long time seems like too much of a coincidence. Especially since Google/Motorola just did the same exact thing to WP8/Lumia in September with the participation of Eric Schmidt. Schmidt seems quite fond of trolling Microsoft with his gang of four nonsense too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s late October, every major player is trying to squeeze in their own announcements without being bruised. We&#8217;re going to see a bucketload of tech news these coming weeks and it&#8217;s simply prudent of every party to  ensure they get the lion&#8217;s share of the coverage by cock-blocking everyone else.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obviously simply expedient for Google to coincide these dates (assuming it was deliberate), and doesn&#8217;t speak to how &#8216;threatened&#8217; they might feel.</p>
<p>I really like your profile pic. Classic.</p>
<p>Google is not threatened but they are definitely trying to get their news out first so that they can also be in the news on that day.</p>
<p>They know that WP8 will get the lions share of the coverage on the day, they just want to make sure they they are not completely left out of the news on an important day.</p>
<p>I think by unveiling a bunch of new Nexus phones and new Android features your goal is more than just get some headlines. I think the goal is to overshadow Windows Phone 8 unveiling completely.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>However, the WP8 launch is just part of the &#8216;major&#8217; launch that MS is doing. Google can&#8217;t match the bigger picture yet in terms of full-featured services that MS offers.</p>
<p>Aside from office what full featured services can Google not match?</p>
<p>Google does not have a widely adopted desktop OS, it has something that isn&#8217;t even competing with OSX.</p>
<p>Google is the internet. In that sense, it integrates perfectly well with my Windows machines, my Linux machines, and, if I had them, my OSX machines.</p>
<p>They have 1 maybe 2 Nexus phones lined up but what they do have lined up is a 10 inch Nexus Tablet by Samsung as a direct competitor to the iPad and The Surface</p>
<p>The &#8220;gang of four&#8221; stuff was rather accurate though.</p>
<p>You might be more find of Apple CEO Tim Cook, &#8220;&#8230;there&#8217;s a horse in Redmond that always runs&#8230;&#8221;, that&#8217;s more hopeful :-)</p>
<p><a href="http://mobile.theverge.com/2012/1/24/2730972/tim-cook-phone-market-isnt-a-two-horse-race-theres-a-horse-in-redmond" target="_blank">http://mobile.theverge.com/2012/1/24/2730972/tim-cook-phone-market-isnt-a-two-horse-race-theres-a-horse-in-redmond</a></p>
<p>Nah the gang of four comment was specifically done to dis Microsoft which is why all questions and commentary following the comment revolve around the absence of Microsoft. And hysterically he even left MS out of the top 6 or 7 tech companies indicating that eBay, Paypal, and Twitter were more important than Microsoft.</p>
<p>Tim Cook&#8217;s comment about the horse in Redmond that always runs was complimentary. He was being questioned as to whether it was a two horse race between Android and iPhone and he said no, Microsoft always competes and can&#8217;t be ignored.</p>
<p>Be honest, if you asked ten people on the street which tech companies were the best, do you think you&#8217;d get an answer much different to &#8220;the gang of four&#8221;, Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon?</p>
<p>Apple devices are beloved globally, the last ten years have belonged to them, they&#8217;ve become the biggest public company in the world.</p>
<p>Google holds the internet together, and they constantly innovate new technologies.  Everyone uses Google products.</p>
<p>Facebook is where people live their lives.  Over a billion users.  Walking down the street in any developed city, you&#8217;ll see ads mentioning &#8220;like us on Facebook!&#8221;, hear people talking about Facebook, and using Facebook, most likely on either an Apple or Google OS device.</p>
<p>Amazon is an incredibly big company, that&#8217;s killed off more &#8220;bricks n mortar&#8221; buildings than you could shake a stick at.  The Kindle is well known and loved.</p>
<p>In the 2010&#8217;s, would people mention Microsoft now at all?  I live my life without Microsoft products, most of my friends do likewise.</p>
<p>What have been their big products in the last ten years?  Windows XP, Vista and 7?  Office 20-whatever?</p>
<p>Riveting stuff!</p>
<p>At the very end of 2012, they&#8217;re releasing some big products, they are again trying to make it in the Post PC world, they are relaunching a new Tablet orientated platform, and even going the Apple/Nexus route of directly stepping into the market.</p>
<p>Until November 2012, you can&#8217;t really accuse them of having huge exciting products in the last few years.  I doubt they would spring into mind as an innovative and market leading company.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how 2013 goes, onwards and upwards!</p>
<p>i think so.</p>
<p>Well the media and interviewees certainly didn&#8217;t think Schmidt&#8217;s statements made sense and was intentionally done as an attack on Microsoft. The last Vergecast podcast even called them out on this.</p>
<p>And no I think very few people would list Amazon and Facebook as the best tech companies. Recently there was a poll done that said most Americans believe Facebook is a fad, couple that with the fact that their IPO was one of the biggest failures in recent history. Amazon bigger than Microsoft? I think it&#8217;s hard to make a credible case for that. Amazon is certainly a competitor to Microsoft in cloud storage/services, but in most respects Amazon is seen as more of a competitor to Walmart than Microsoft.</p>
<p>The guy put Twitter, eBay, and Paypal before Microsoft. It was a massive troll, stop trying to make sense of it. He actually claimed last week that Chromebooks were more significant for consumers than anything Microsoft is making.  Dude is free to say what he wants, but he sounds ridiculous. Schmidt happens.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s not forget Google&#8217;s nasty response to the Nokia Windows Phone agreement: &#8220;Two turkeys don&#8217;t make an eagle.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/11/nokias-elop-responds-to-googles-two-turkeys-tweet/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/11/nokias-elop-responds-to-googles-two-turkeys-tweet/</a></p>
<p>Google fans have to really bury their heads in the sand to miss all the Google trolling against Microsoft. Not saying it doesn&#8217;t go both ways (Gmail man?), but to pretend like there isn&#8217;t serious intentional public animosity between the two companies is absurd.</p>
<p>It definitely goes both ways with both taking valid points and turning them up to 14 where they get all distorted and lose all meaning. The point Schmidt was trying to make is valid. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t really revolutionized the way we interact with technology or information significantly in quite a while at least as far as the average consumer is concerned.</p>
<p>Tell me what has Google done to revolutionize technology. Microsoft makes the best keyboards/mices. They make the Xbox, have the most used OS and the fastest growing OS. It&#8217;s obvious we see many MS haters on the verge and obvious since most of the writers themselves are MS haters. Apple has not done anything innovative since the iPhone, Ipad is just a bigger iPhone&#8230; What has Google done? nada! Yet MS has the best and most exciting R&amp;D branch of any company. So please&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, I am not an MS hater &#8211; I actually am excited about what they having coming down the pipeline, but really keyboards and mice is the first thing you lead with?<br />
Google has done quite a bit to revolutionize technology &#8211; just look at all the &#8216;free&#8217; services they offer. I&#8217;ll take maps for example, which with their efforts they may have single-handily revolutionize/destroyed the dedicated GPS market. To marginalize their impact on technology is pretty ridiculous on your part.<br />
With Apple, your honestly going to mention keyboards and mice with MS&#8230; and then off-handily say that Apple hasn&#8217;t done anything since the iPhone and the iPad. These two devices have been only introduced in the 5-6 years&#8230; what exactly has MS done with the keyboard and the mouse that has changed the way we use them in that time span? If anything, Apple&#8217;s recent mouse with its touch scroll wheel &#8211; which works with gestures has done more to push the direction we are going with that product.  And please don&#8217;t say that the iPad is just a bigger iPhone. What do you think is pushing the whole tablet craze right now? Bottom-line, people wouldn&#8217;t have a Windows Surface RT tablet or a Nexus Tablet without the iPad.<br />
Microsoft is doing a lot of good things right now, and they definitely have everyone&#8217;s attention. Just settle down with the MS flag a bit.</p>
<p>Just talking internet/online services: <strong>IE</strong> is still the top browser, <strong>Bing</strong> controls 35% of search in the US, <strong>Hotmail/outlook </strong>is still most used webmail worldwide, <strong>Skype</strong> is the top VOIP service in the world, <strong>Xbox Live </strong>is the top subscription gaming service, <strong>Xbox video </strong>is the #1 video service in the living room, <strong>Office 365 </strong>and Lync and Azure and on and on. Suggesting that Microsoft is not relevant in the online space is absolutely absurd.</p>
<p>When you add in the fact that Microsoft dominates the PC market with close to 90% OS market share and has had the top selling game console in the US for 2 years you just start scratching the surface of how ridiculous the claim is.</p>
<p>I use Twitter, I like Twitter a lot, but Twitter has a long way to go before they claim to be on the level of a Microsoft. It would be nice if Twitter could figure out a business model for starters. Right now Twitter is no more relevant than a Skype or YouTube.</p>
<blockquote> IE is still the top browser</blockquote>
<p>IE fell from its top position.</p>
<p><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/" target="_blank">http://gs.statcounter.com/</a></p>
<p>Did you know that Statcounter is not representative?</p>
<p>Can you provide a link that is more so?</p>
<p>That supposed to be @trololler</p>
<p>For example netmarketshare counts unique site visitors and calculates the worldwide stat with weighted country data (contrary to statcounter). On the other hand, it monitors much less web sites than statcounter.</p>
<p>This is a subjective optinion, but I think the real markeshare is more near to netmarketshare&#8217;s estimation.</p>
<blockquote>They make the Xbox, have the most used OS and the fastest growing OS. </blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but the fastest growing OS by far is Android. Soon (2013) it will be the most used OS also.</p>
<p>Lets not call other people &#8220;fans&#8221; or talk about &#8220;trolls&#8221;.  It only angers people up, like talking about &#8220;YOU conservatives just cant&#8230;..&#8221; or &#8220;YOU liberals all wanna&#8230;.&#8221;.  Nobody likes being labelled either way, and more often than not, you&#8217;ll be MISlabelled! :-)</p>
<p>Its not &#8220;trolling&#8221; if they&#8217;re telling the facts as they are.   When The Verge report on Company X and mention its kinda not doing well, having lost a billion odd dollars in the last quarter, is that &#8220;trolling&#8221;?</p>
<p>Its true that Microsoft has reportedly been feeling the pressure from Google market strength, yes.  Ballmer himself, the freaking CEO has lost his mind over them, <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2005/09/ballmer_throws_a_chair_at_fing_google.php">literally throwing furniture about his executive office!</a></p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Prior to joining Google, I set up a meeting on or about November 11, 2004 with Microsoft’s CEO Steve Ballmer to discuss my planned departure….At some point in the conversation Mr. Ballmer said: "Just tell me it’s not Google." I told him it was Google.<br />
<br />
At that point, Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room hitting a table in his office. Mr. Ballmer then said: "Fucking Eric Schmidt is a fucking pussy. I’m going to fucking bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. I’m going to fucking kill Google." ….<br />
<br />
Thereafter, Mr. Ballmer resumed trying to persuade me to stay….Among other things, Mr. Ballmer told me that "Google’s not a real company. It’s a house of cards."&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Google on the other hand?  When have Google flipped out about a Microsoft product trying to compete with them?</p>
<p>That quote recalls an event in late 2004.  Imagine the world of 2004&#8230;&#8230;.the hottest tech on the streets were Apple iPods, and the Motorla V3 RAZR.  What was Microsoft doing back then, selling Windows XP and Office?</p>
<p>If thats the pressure CEO Ballmer felt back then from Google, just imagine what they feel now, that Android has absolutely overwhelmed them in the Post PC era, and with Windows Phone where it is.</p>

<p>Wait &#8211; you think most people think Facebook is some kind of fad?  That everyone will have just forgotten about it in&#8230;.a months time?</p>
<p>I work in an Antique and Secondhand store, a family business.  Started by my grandfather, my father bought in, and now I work restoring furniture in my workshop, often listening in live to The Vergecast and The Verge Mobile Show.</p>
<p>We decided to run a new round of online advertising to help our family business.</p>
<p>Where do you think we turned to?  Where would <strong>you</strong> choose to advertise?  We&#8217;ve done radio commercials years ago&#8230;.but radio isnt exactly vibrant, regular people do not listen to the radio anymore, and increasingly television is dying too.  Certainly not worth the great cost and hassle.</p>
<p>Print media?  Dead, hell, my city of 50,000 can no longer even print our own daily newspaper here anymore, The Southland Times is printed 200 kilometres away (over 2 hours drive).  Huge cost, dying market, not worth it.</p>
<p>We advertised online, and where do you go?  Google Ads, for search?  How many people does that reach, and how many people are likely to just happen to search for &#8220;Antique furniture in Invercargill&#8221;?</p>
<p>Facebook is the place to be for advertising.  Everyone in my city who uses Facebook in their web browser has a chance to see our ad.  It costs a couple dollars a day, from a maximum set advertising budget.  Simple, cheap, and wide scale.  Its lovely having people come in and say they saw our ad on Facebook.</p>
<p>In ten years time will we all be using Facebook, through Google Glass?  Who knows.  Presumably not.  Empires crap out over time, eh?</p>
<p>Amazon is one of the most innovative and popular businesses of recent times.  Well worth reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com">their Wikipedia entry</a> for a quick history lesson.  THIS is how you sell products well in the 2010&#8217;s.</p>
<p>You mentioned Twitter, eBay and Paypal.  I wouldnt think of those companies off hand, like the the big four, but they are all undoubtably big and important.</p>
<p>More relevant in day to day life than Microsoft?  Well, I used Twitter today on my phone, used it twice on my computer yesterday as well as on my phone&#8230;.have been arranging a new podcast episode with contributors through Twitter&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;eBay is not really in New Zealand, we use our own auction site <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/">TradeMe</a>&#8230;.its the largest site in the whole country, one of the few markets where a local entrant booted out the global auction standard eBay.</p>
<p>I used Paypal today to pay for another advertising order, its the default online payment standard, it protects your credit card details, and costs nothing for buyers.  Its fast, simple and everywhere.</p>
<p>The last Microsoft product I&#8217;ve used is Skype, and its not particularly enjoyable to use anymore since the &#8220;recent&#8221; UI changes (a year or so ago!)</p>
<p>The big four listed are very influential, very popular and massively profitable companies.  They deserve their ranking.</p>
<p>umm&#8230; maybe something called the xbox 360,  pretty much the pioneer of centralizing pc media content and services, in the living room</p>
<p>How many regular consumers think of that use of an Xbox? The point is that when you think of some of the biggest things to change our lives in the past few years not too many things come up from Microsoft. Yes they have had successful products but have they revolutionized the way people interact with each other on the internet (Facebook and Twitter), have they changed people&#8217;s perceptions of mobile computing (Apple and their iPad), have they brought smartphone technology from a business focused tool for the rich to the masses (Apple and Google)?</p>
<p>What has Microsoft done to truly change the way we interact with the world in the past 5 years? Google, Apple, Facebook all have.</p>
<p>LOL Are you serious?!</p>
<p>I am one of those people who&#8217;d be asked in that survey and I would list Microsoft as one of the top tech companies and I&#8217;m very sure many of my friends would as well (And we&#8217;re the young adult, just graduated from teens group).</p>
<p>-XBOX<br />
-KINECT<br />
-WINDOWS<br />
-ZUNE<br />
-OFFICE<br />
-SKYPE</p>
<p>Plus I bet the majority of those man-in-the-street people you question wouldn&#8217;t list Facebook and Amazon as tech companies because they don&#8217;t know much about them besides using their services.</p>
<p>Facebook is a web page. And could be a fad like MySpace, etc.</p>
<p>Microsoft software runs on 90% of the world&#8217;s computers, especially in enterprise. Furthermore MS has 12 Billion-dollar businesses, and is far more diversified than Google (advertising) and Apple (70% of profits from a single product). To dis it in a gang of four or 6 or 7 is a clear jab, or Schmidt is borderline insane.</p>
<p>The translation of Schmidt&#8217;s latest antics is: he&#8217;s afraid of MS more than anybody else. MS in their own words said that WP8 is going after Android and BB (not iPhone), and Google has failed at making a dent in desktop OS (Chromebook) and productivity (Google docs), both MS entrenched businesses. Furthermore they compete on search, cloud, maps, etc., Isn&#8217;t it extremely clear that Schmidt is simply talking shit to discredit his biggest and most dangerous competitor, afraid that MS could find the next business to entrench themselves in?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that he&#8217;s necessarily afraid.  However, he&#8217;d be a fool not to take Microsoft seriously, and not to everything in his power to counter their attempts to grow marketshare.</p>
<p>RIM used to say that iPhone was not a threat, and was merely a passing fad, and sat back and did nothing to counter Apple&#8217;s gains.  Look at where RIM is now.  Microsoft isn&#8217;t in anywhere near as strong a position as Apple was, but they have the money to stay in it for the long haul, and can shove nearly unlimited quantities of cash at it.</p>
<p>Microsoft may not be a threat today, but they could become one, and Microsoft would like nothing better than to take over every market Google currently leads.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t expect Amazon in the slightest.</p>
<p>Really? I can see why you&#8217;d think the desktop OSs used by 90% of the world is boring, but there&#8217;s no way you can discount Microsoft as a major player in technology.</p>
<p>If you think the internal analysis at Google agrees with what Schmidt says, you&#8217;re wrong. Even if W8 is a failure, 0% market penetration Microsoft will still be a major player in technology, and that is just not going to happen.</p>
<p>For every person on the planet that knows what Facebook and Amazon are there are 3 that have USED Microsoft products.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get what kind of kool-aid your drinking but it must be potent. One billion users, LOL there are somewhere along the lines of  4. billion computers out there, want to break down into percentages and then figure out how many are Windows?</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a Post Pc World! that&#8217;s marketing speak. PC&#8217;s are not going no where and the many people I know that have Ipads only use it temporarily and when doing work they use their laptops.</p>
<p>amazon over windows?</p>
<p>no. i cant elaborate right now, but i disagree.</p>
<blockquote>Be honest, if you asked ten people on the street which tech companies were the best, do you think you’d get an answer much different to "the gang of four", Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon?</blockquote>
<p>I just need to say that Amazon isn&#8217;t that known here in the Netherlands and probably most of Europe except the UK.</p>
<p>Mainly because they don&#8217;t even do business there, but this guy thinks the world ends at the coasts of California and NY.</p>
<p>Add Germany as an Amazon stronghold in Europe. If you look into a DHL truck in Germany you will most certainly find a huge amount of Amazon packets.</p>
<p>Sans 2012 -</p>
<p>Windows XP<br />
Xbox<br />
Xbox 360<br />
Windows 7<br />
Windows Phone 7<br />
Zune (and its services)<br />
Office 2003, 2007, 2010<br />
Bing</p>
<p> And now we come to 2012 where Microsoft are in position to have a massive ecosystem in place, phone, tablet, server and PC. Hardly a fail.</p>
<blockquote>What have been their big products in the last ten years?</blockquote>
<p>Exchange server, Active Directory, MS SQL Server, Terminal Services, Sharepoint, XBOX.  You may not need these as a simple consumer, but to many enterprises there are no truly viable alternatives on the marketplace.</p>
<p>This event will be a real Yawn. What&#8217;s new? Android same old same old. WP8 = New. Android = old, iOS &#8211; Ancient.</p>
<p>Too bad that in this case &#8216;new&#8217; hasn&#8217;t helped sell devices.</p>
<p>Not yet, however Microsoft has never lost on anything. They just keep coming until they win. They will again, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Heres hoping.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t hope. They never lose, it&#8217;s only a matter of time.</p>
<p>yes, we got that&#8230; Chill !!</p>
<p>LOL, OK. Hope you got the pattern</p>
<p>Only time will tell. And so far&#8230;.eh.</p>
<p>Its a dead cert</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>look it up</p>
<p>No. Just save me the time.</p>
<p>sorry on skype call</p>
<p>I looked it up. You failed me with your Skype call. I had to open another window. Damn you :-/</p>
<p>could&#8217;ve used a tab.</p>
<p>err&#8230;Zune? Maybe it will rise from the grave and keep coming?</p>
<p>Problem is after decades ON search they still underdog. On music player, the market vanished before they win. Saying that they always win just a matter of time is bizarre. It&#8217; s meaningless if it will be forever until all the galaxies on the universe melted.</p>
<p>Zune. Nuff said.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 7.  Nuff said.</p>
<p>This is even less true. Smartphone market is in its infancy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll say that at this point that&#8217;s more like a pre-teen.</p>
<p>Still more to learn, but knows right from wrong.</p>
<p>Not entirely. Google is creeping up to nearly 1 billion Android devices. That&#8217;s a hell of a lot.</p>
<p>True that market died before they could take it over but they would have if it existed.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>when did you last buy an ipod?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s completely irrelevant. Zunes were around for years and failed to gain any traction. iPods (and other MP3 players) are <em>still</em> selling like hotcakes.</p>
<p>You may want to come back to planet Earth.</p>
<p>what are the  other mp3 players that sell like hotcakes?</p>
<p>I just meant MP3 players in general.</p>
<p>Smartphones?  My best guess.</p>
<p>Hotcakes?  Hardly.  iPods sales are in continual decline.</p>
<p>And before the cancelled the zune, almost every reviewer preferred the zune.  With time in a hot market, it would have made it.  Or so I hope&#8230;.</p>
<p>1% of 10 trillion is still 100 billion. Just because something is in decline doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t selling in huge numbers.</p>
<p>when will the planet earth have 10 trillion population?</p>
<p>bit.ly/sQHqP4</p>
<p>bingo</p>
<p>Also Vista and Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Oh, and that time they lost to the US Government</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget the gem of Windows millennium that&#8217;s they basically steeped off the face of the Earth. Lol</p>
<p>In losing Vista was more successful than all Mac OSes and more than ChromeOS can ever dream of being. #TrueStory</p>
<p>Also, Window Vista and the Kin. You can say &#8220;well they fixed it with Windows 7 and Windows Phone&#8221; but that&#8217;s just like saying if you keep throwing things at a wall something will eventually stick.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like baseball you only get a finite number of misses until you&#8217;re out. Microsoft has a lot of cash and a lot of people locked in so they can afford a few flops but that won&#8217;t be the case in perpetuity.</p>
<p>MS just bored from that kind of market (mp3), It leaves it for less smart companies, like Apple, let they do that toys for monkeys, there is no science in it. MS has more intelligent projects to care about.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right. That Zune just creamed everyone in the music player market&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh wait..</p>
<p>Kin.</p>
<p>Zune says hi.</p>
<p>Zune has gone on to interate into both Windows Phone and Xbox Music.</p>
<p>Yeah I was talking about the music player that went on to iterate into extinction.</p>
<p>And I was talking about how the Zune&#8217;s interface eventually replaced the Windows based Windows Mobile interface to become Windows Phone&#8217;s interface.</p>
<p>^LOL. Nice one.</p>
<p>Google will have over 1 billion activations early next year. Calling it now.</p>
<p> I predict there will be a bigger android installed base then Windows installed base by the end of next year</p>
<p>Sounds like Microsoft will have made a lot of money then.  : P</p>
<p>Touché.</p>
<p>Even while they lose, they win. Diabolical.</p>
<p>As a consumer or even a developer, why do you need to care if MS is making money or not?</p>
<p>As long as Android is increasing in popularity, I don&#8217;t give two sh*ts about how Google is doing. In the end, their services are going to gain more users anyway.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s cool making money at others expense.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s modern business at its finest.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not being sarcastic. This is my serious face</p>
<p>:-|</p>
<p>The most obvious sign of an astroturfer is placing ludicrous emphasis on corporate profits.</p>
<p>Or market share.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft can use that money to keep pushing competition in a diverse range of products.  Even if you don&#8217;t use their product in each race, it will at least spur their competitors to continue innovating.</p>
<p>Microsoft are pretty much the only company providing any real competition for search, even if it is a loss maker for them.  Their initially loss-making foray into consoles resulted in the Kinect, which is an excellent product.  And some of the good stuff from WP even ended up making it into IOS (camera from lock?) and Android (unified people hub).</p>
<p>I believe you mean:  Than, not Then.</p>
<p>Then denotes a period of time/time marker.  Than denotes a comparative statement.</p>
<p>Yes I did lol. Voice dictate ftl =0(</p>
<p>How is WP8 anything but an incremental upgrade to WP7?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s running on a completely different kernel. It&#8217;s the first time that Windows phones have ever used the same NT kernel as Windows PCs/tablets. Things like native code, DirectX and Windows applications are now code compatible between Windows PC and phone.</p>
<p>This is possibly the biggest and most significant upgrade that Windows mobile/phone has ever received.</p>
<p>That means diddly squat to consumers.  Consumers who have, to date, completely ignored Windows Phone.</p>
<p>It means diddly squat to consumers that Windows Phone is going to be code compatible with the most popular software platform in the world? Major game engines and middleware programs have already been announced for WP8 like Unity 3D an Havok. Major game titles like the entire Angry Bird series have been announced and Gameloft&#8217;s top games like NOVA 3 and Asphalt 7 have been announced along with major mobile game series like Draw Something and Words with Friends. Angry Birds Star Wars is going to be available day and date on WP8. The point is that things are already starting to change massively for consumers on WP8.</p>
<p>I agree with you that consumers don&#8217;t understand why this change is so important, yet. But they will understand the result of this change which is that the best games and apps are going to be available for Windows Phone much more often now. And WP8 might be capable of a few tricks thanks to DirectX that Android and iOS are going to be salivating over.</p>
<p>"Oh, boy! Native code! I’m <em>so</em> buying Windows Phone 8!" &#8211; No average consumer, ever</p>
<p>Way to miss the point. It&#8217;s what is the result of that ability that is important. WP7 being stuck on Silverlight and XNA only was like trying to fight with both hands tied behind your back. Tons of code and game engines and apps that have been written for Windows PC/tablet is now useable on Windows Phone for the first time ever.</p>
<p>The result is a much better software ecosystem.</p>
<p>The kernel doesn&#8217;t matter at all to native code. My old ass Moto Q running WinMo 5 (same kernel as WP7) is &#8220;code compatible&#8221; with Windows on desktop &#8211; hell, it&#8217;s also &#8220;code compatible&#8221; with Android, desktop Linux, and OS X at the standard C/C++ level. Because that&#8217;s the whole point of programming languages and APIs, they create abstractions. The standard C/C++ API hasn&#8217;t changed for something like 20 years now.</p>
<p>DirectX is nothing special for phones, the mobile gaming world is already entrenched in OpenGL ES. And your windows apps will <strong>NOT</strong> run on WP8 &#8211; hell, they won&#8217;t even run on Windows RT (what the $500 surface tablet runs)</p>
<p>Unity 3D, Havok, and Unreal Engine have already been announced as coming to WinRT. So that&#8217;s a huge change from Windows Phone 7 and anything that came before it.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say Windows apps would run, they run with minor modifications.  I said the code would be useable on Windows Phone 8. Windows Phone 7 could not use C/C++, etc. Now a developer can use the code and game engine that they created for a Windows app or other platform on WP8, this makes a huge difference in the amount of software and level of quality in software that you will see on WP8 compared to WP7.</p>
<p>Windows 8, Windows RT and Windows Phone 8 all share a common run time environment called WinRT. This unification of the platform has never occurred before and being able to leverage the platforms is of no small significance to the software ecosystem or it&#8217;s developers.</p>
<p>Windows Phone will be another webOS; popular with enthusiasts but it won&#8217;t sell in any numbers worth mentioning. The only thing that&#8217;ll keep it going will be Microsoft&#8217;s refusal to admit failure.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what you think. Just watch. Microsoft isn&#8217;t Palm/HP.</p>
<p>This is true however, Microsoft has yet to regain the ground they lost in the smartphone arena.  This isn&#8217;t their first effort in the smartphone market place. Their efforts haaven&#8217;t produced much fruit thus far. The leaders are well established, it will be hard to displace the kings of the hill.</p>
<p>I find Microsoft fanboys day dreaming of Apple and Google feeling threaten hilarious. Microsoft is the one that needs to show something really amazing in their show, otherwise nobody will care. They are not a relevant player in the smartphone market yet, even Bada outsold Microsoft&#8217;s WP7 last quarter xDDDD.</p>
<p>Thing is, Google and Apple are certainly &#8220;threatened&#8221; or at least realize that WP posses some threat. It&#8217;s just good business to never dismiss your competitors. Schmidt may do it in front of reporters but you know that Google is always keeping up with what is going on over at Redmond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying Microsoft won&#8217;t show something great, I really hope they do. I&#8217;m merely saying it isn&#8217;t a relevant player, which is stating a simple fact.</p>
<p>Bada didn&#8217;t outsell WP7 last quarter and Bada has been cancelled by Samsung; it&#8217;s replacement Tizen has also been delayed.  Nice try though.</p>
<p>Hey I agree with you that the pressure was on Microsoft and they could easily fall on their face without any interference from Google. The question in my mind is why is Google so nervous that they decided to intervene on the Lumia 920 announcement and now the WP8 launch.</p>
<p>Keep in mind these companies know a lot more about what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes than we do. If WP8 is such a big joke why is Google using it&#8217;s Motorola and Nexus events to try to overshadow WP8?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fact. While Bada has been cancelled, the remaining phones outsold WP:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=2120015" target="_blank">http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=2120015</a></p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>&#8220;keeping up with&#8221; is <strong>extremely</strong> different from &#8220;threatened&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Google nor Apple is in any way threatened by Microsoft. They are certainly watching, but more with a curious look and a maybe a snicker.</p>
<p>Get real, a $2 billion ad campaign for the next Windows OS could easily disrupt Google and Apple&#8217;s big plans for the tablet market. Is it going to destroy them? No, but it could put a huge kink in their plans. Android is already on shaky ground in the tablet space, their phone OEMs are getting sued and patent licensed into a position that makes Android unprofitable for them, and Apple has a long history of being overtaken in markets that they pioneer.</p>
<p>The companies being threatened is a compliment of competence. If they weren&#8217;t threatened by Windows 8 and WP8 then I&#8217;d say they were run by incompetent people. Tim Cook even said it himself regarding the mobile phone space, this is not a two horse race.</p>
<p>And apple/google or other companies will not spend anything on ad campaign? Android partners are unprofitable? Samsung just made a profit of 7.2Billion on the back of Galaxy sales. How about Nokia? How much profit did it make this Q?</p>
<p>Please keep your xDDDDs and general nonsense to your GChat conversations. I gave Google a pass for the Motorola event, if you wish to be fooled a second time then you&#8217;re the idiot.</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t need your passes, nor does Apple.</p>
<p>Then tell me why was the Motorola event scheduled to the exact same day as the Nokia event? And now this? I think it was surely a coincidence. ;)</p>
<p>Dude&#8230;..it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like Googles event will over shadow the Windows event&#8230;.oh wait&#8230;.</p>
<p>no it won&#8217;t. Period.</p>
<p>yes it might. Exclamation point.</p>
<p>el oh el. Smiley face.</p>
<p>Ampersand.</p>
<p>I think the weird thing, whether it does overshadow or not, that Google feels the need to do this. Why do they need to announce new Motorola and Nexus phones every time there is a big Windows Phone 8 event?</p>
<p>I think it gives more credibility to Windows Phone by reacting in this way. Android is killing Windows Phone in sales, why target Microsoft so aggressively if they&#8217;re not a threat?</p>
<p>Why is everyone saying that Google does this every time?</p>
<p>Hasn&#8217;t it only happened once before? Please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. I didn&#8217;t bother scouring the Internet.</p>
<p>2 events in 2 months, Google schedules their big Motorola and Nexus events for the same day as WP8/Nokia unveilings.</p>
<p>Yes it&#8217;s sad enough that it happened even one time, that it&#8217;s becoming a pattern is really strange.</p>
<p>Maybe Ballmer and Scmidt had some kind of fight recently to provoke all this?</p>
<p>Ballmer didn&#8217;t wipe the sweat off the exercise bike at the gym and Schmidt got angry because it was his turn next.</p>
<p>There should be an unfunny flag :P</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Nexus event is always around this time of year and every major tech company is cramming events in the 20 somthingth of October. Oct 29 was also widely rumored for a while. It&#8217;s not Google&#8217;s fault MS chose the same day.</p>
<p>Yes I understand that products are always announced in September and October. However Google controls Motorola and Nexus events and has scheduled them after Microsoft WP8 event dates are announced for the same exact day. And the last time they did this it was done in an overt fashion. They told journalists it was &#8220;the biggest event of the day&#8221; and they booked a terrible band called the Kin to play.</p>
<p>Every time chairman Schmidt goes on AllthingsD he trashes Microsoft. Last week he actually told them that Chromebooks were more relevant to consumers than the Surface or Xbox.  :-D</p>
<p>Google shouldn&#8217;t have to go out of their way to avoid MS events. This was planned for a long time. Maybe last it was a dig at MS but there&#8217;s no sure way to know. And you&#8217;re on even thinner ground this time.<br />
I don&#8217;t understand why MS fans always see a conspiracy in everything.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a conspiracy. Google/Schmidt hates Microsoft. A conspiracy implies multiple parties working together surreptitiously .</p>
<p>Why do you care so much?</p>
<p>First, no, Google doesn&#8217;t hate Microsoft. They don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re innovative/one of the &#8220;big four&#8221;.</p>
<p>Second, no, a conspiracy doesn&#8217;t mean multiple parties working together.</p>
<p>Google does HATE Microsoft and vice versa. And both for good reason I might add.</p>
<p>Google and Microsoft are not friendly competitors at all.</p>
<p>Conspiracy does involve multiple parties:</p>
<p><strong>con·spir·a·cy</strong></p>
<p>• An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act.<br />
• A group of conspirators.<br />
•Law. An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.<br />
• A joining or acting together, as if by sinister design: a conspiracy of wind and tide that devastated coastal areas.</p>

<p>What a joke. You actually believe that? &#8220;iSheep&#8221; are heaven compared to Google loyalists.</p>
<blockquote>However Google controls Motorola and Nexus events and has scheduled them after Microsoft WP8 event dates are announced for the same exact day. </blockquote>
<p>Nope, MS scheduled on top of Google&#8217;s announcement. Google&#8217;s announcement is coinciding with All Things D, which was announced ages ago and isn&#8217;t run by Google. Andy Rubin has been listed as a speaker on Oct 29 for a long, long time now &#8211; well before MS&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>A few things, this also coincides with Andy Rubin&#8217;s stop at All Things D where he typically shows off the new Nexus phone and talks about the new Android build.</p>
<p>This also allows for iPad mini rumors to die down a little.</p>
<p>And really, Schmidt may not have publicly called WP a threat but no good businessman is going to get in front of a microphone and extol how threatening a competitor is and give them free publicity and a defacto stamp of approval. Google is playing smarter and perhaps a little dirtier than Apple, they know it could easily become a 3 horse race if they don&#8217;t beat Microsoft back at every chance they get. It&#8217;s business you kick the competitor while they&#8217;re down until they can&#8217;t get back up and then you tape them to the floor.</p>
<p>Not rumors of the iPad mini but Buzz. In addition, it would be crazy for Google to want to be last to announce something or first with 3 big announcements in such a short window.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know did the Google event overshadow the Nokia Event?  I&#8217;m trying to remember what received all the comments and hype on Theverge and engadget.  Can someone remind me?</p>
<p>I sincerely hope someone pointed out to this guy that the two events do NOT fall on the same day. Surface comes out on the 26th, and the Android event on the 29th. All I see are people engaging him in this ridiculous discussion.</p>
<p>The Windows Phone 8 release date is the 29th of October.  The 26th is for Windows 8 and the Surface.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been known to be late October for a LONG time. I think the date planning was more the other way around. but eh, not like it really matters, everyone will look at both on the tech sites anyway.</p>
<p>Cry me a river, WP8 is not going anymore.<br />
For fucks sake, Lumia 920 is  ATT exclusive &#8211; RIP Nokia</p>
<p>Dude what are you talking about?. . . Oh let me guess Apple is soooooo insure because they have an event so close to Microsofts event? That&#8217;s your logic right? just shut up.</p>
<p>Apple is a little scared of Windows 8 launch and the big tablet push, sure. But at least they&#8217;re not purposely scheduling their events for the same day and trying to claim it&#8217;s the biggest most important event of the day.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Apple is scared at all. They&#8217;re going to keep selling 10+ million iPads per quarter even with the Surface. I think Google is more concerned since the surface is much better than every single Android tablet to date. I have yet to see anybody claim otherwise.</p>
<p>Apple could have announced the iPad mini at their iPhone/iPod event a few weeks ago. They want iPad mini launch to be right next to Surface/Windows 8 launch. You know that there&#8217;s going to be a ton of coverage for the Windows 8 launch and Microsoft is spending a huge amount on advertising for both Surface and Windows. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s controversial to say that Apple is having this event during Windows 8 launch week just to make sure they steal some headlines and mindshare. This is a very unusually late product announcement time for Apple. And it&#8217;s a good move on Apple&#8217;s part, it&#8217;s smart, but it would seem really petty if they scheduled all their big events for the same day as Microsoft as Google has been doing these past couple of months.</p>
<p>Uh no. Im tired of all these crappy laggy malware infested abdroid tablets wasting space at best buy. Time to clear out the coasters and make room for a real pc/tablet. I don&#8217;t need an android tablet, I can already check email and surf the internet on my phone.</p>
<p>Lol.</p>
<p>I actually agree with what you are saying. Is not about fear, is about mind share. MS was going to have the whole end of Oct. with a flood of launches, and the tech sites would be mostly about MS stories. These announcements are meant to counter that.</p>
<p>They are concerned about losing mindshare and marketshare to Microsoft this holiday season. I&#8217;m not saying they think they&#8217;re in danger of going out of business, just saying they don&#8217;t want iPad to get overshadowed this holiday season by Windows tablets and PCs.</p>
<p>I agree but unless theres some new innovating product from these two companies I think there just trying to make us think they want to ride the coattails when in reality they realize there announcements for the most part  are meaningless releases about meaningless products. Im not talking about quality but ipad mini and nexus phone&#8230;oh goodee. Save your time and just send out a press release&#8230;.or email.</p>
<p>iPhone and iPad events have always been mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro is  a completely different proposal. It might indeed have its uses, mainly as a notebook replacement for lightweight users, one that doubles as a somewhat portable tablet, but it&#8217;s market niche is a completely different one.</p>
<p>The regular Surface is a joke. Seriously, laughable hardware, laughable price-point, no ecosystem. I&#8230; really, there&#8217;s no other words. Joke. Bad one.</p>
<p>The point is that Surface is expected to sell 3-5 million units this quarter according to analysts and Surface is getting a half a billion dollar ad campaign independent from Windows 8&#8217;s own $1.5 billion ad campaign. It is ridiculous to say that Apple is not at all concerned with what Microsoft is doing.</p>
<p>You may not like Surface, but that&#8217;s besides the point.</p>
<p>Yes, and the whole reason why Google and Apple are planning events around the same time is to steal media attention and buzz from these devices and hopefully have Microsoft end up wasting advertising money. It&#8217;s really nothing dirty, it&#8217;s all just basic competitive strategy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if it feel&#8217;s like I&#8217;m stalking your posts, you just seem to be at the end of some of the threads I find interesting. haha</p>
<p>&#8230;quarter according to analysts and Surface&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;to analysts and&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;analysts&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; ANALYSTS &#8230;</p>
<p>. . . . A N A L Y S T S . . . .</p>
<p>You have to love people like yourself. Laughable hardware? David Pierce said <br />
<blockquote>During the tour in Redmond, I was able to actually touch and use the Surface for the first time. In general, the experience is what you&#8217;d expect — the device is light and solid, smooth and fast, with impressive touch response and a gorgeous display</blockquote><br />
The same price point as the ipad is laughable? As far as ecosystem, it already has a better tablet ecosystem than android tablets?  Don&#8217;t understand why people like you are so threatened.</p>
<p>Is what you&#8217;d expect &#8211; that is, nothing more. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s laughable. If you&#8217;re going to put it at the same price point as the market leader, you better have a very compelling product. The Surface isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not compelling what, because you&#8217;re so much more into the ipad and android tablets? I guess when Topolsky did his ipad vs windows 8 comparison on a tablet, and said there were a lot of things that he loved about it&#8230;he was talking out of his ass.</p>
<p>Saying that there are things you like about something is a bit different from saying it&#8217;s a compelling product, you notice.</p>
<p>Are you serious? I don&#8217;t know why you need to play this semantics game just so you can try to rationalize not liking a product.<br />
Products that are compelling are usually ones that have a favorable mix/ration of things we like about them and things we don&#8217;t like. I wonder why Nilay didnt find the note 10.1 compelling? Probably cuz there were more things about it that he disliked vs liked. Let&#8217;s not play this game&#8230;</p>
<p>I like almost everything on a Lamborghini Aventador, yet I bought none. I&#8217;ll let you think about it for a second.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the dumbest analogies I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>I think the median americans imcome is $58k per year. A 500 purchase to 58,000 income isn&#8217;t that big of a deal. I guess if you were making a $46.4 million a year an aventador wouldn&#8217;t be a substantial purchase either.</p>
<p>Oh, and for reference, the Surface is nowhere near the Aventador.</p>
<p>Your missing the point&#8230;.all and I mean all w8 apps will work on surface rt/pro&#8230;..you do realize they will make w8 apps for the pro that will work in rt?? I agree the pro is better no doubt about that but win rt was not dreamt up overnight, theres a reason for that. I only really need backwards compatability for printer drivers&#8230;.but I plan on buying a wif/Bluetooth/nfc printer from hp&#8230;.heh</p>
<p>But if you drop the backwards compatibility from the equation, the support to legacy applications, why would stay with Windows? If you&#8217;re going to start from a clean slate, why do it on a platform that&#8217;s yet completely unproven versus another that&#8217;s the market leader? Hard proposal.</p>
<p>Im just talking RT here. You sound like a power user to me and this is where I believe MS needs to make clear for the consumer, the difference between the two. So, for me I don&#8217;t need legacy programs only office,w8 apps and media consumption. BTW, Im getting the pro as well when released. Its not unproven I have been using it on my phone for 1 year now. yes its a different/better kernel but the same experience but better. When I first used W8 on my laptop I didn&#8217;t get it&#8230;.after 3 days I loved it and wished it had a touch screen. Yes theres a learning curve but its not as drastic as some say it is. eventually all the players, Apple and google included will have to do this, MS is just ahead of the game.</p>
<p>How can anyone said that the Surface I better than any Android when the only time they saw it was when Stephen Sinofsky showed it crashed when opening Internet exporer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the same day.  26th vs. 29th.  I&#8217;m not trying to be a stickler, but you&#8217;ve said this multiple times this thread and it&#8217;s worth setting the record straight.</p>
<p>The WP8 launch event is scheduled for the same day October 29th.</p>
<p>Then they are either doing it at All Things D like Google is, or they are trying to schedule over Google&#8217;s announcement as Andy Rubin was listed as a speaker on Oct 29 for a long time now.</p>
<p>Your an idiot Roku.</p>
<p>Google is NOT scared or worried about sorry ass Microsoft. Nobody is worried about Window 8 or there tiny ass market share. Lol. Window phone is dead in the water. Google is following there launch / event windows, has NOTHING to do with Microsoft lol.</p>
<p>Saying Moto event was the biggest event of the day and hiring the Kin band. Yeah it&#8217;s all just a big coincidence.</p>
<p>Hiring the Kin band?</p>
<p>You think that means anything?</p>
<p>Sigh&#8230;</p>
<p>It definitely does, what other reason would there be? Google and Microsoft are giant dbags to each other. They frequently take jabs at each other and produce videos or make off the cuff comments to trash the other. It&#8217;s kind of petty but fun to watch.</p>
<p>Not as fun as watching the fanboys stick up for their respective sides.</p>
<p>Tiny ass markt share of windows 8? On what planet do you live?</p>
<p>Your word betray you total fear.</p>
<p>As far as I know their market share is even worse on other planets.</p>
<p>Yes the question is which of those planets does he live on, because it&#8217;s obviously not Earth.</p>
<p>Earth, probably, as Windows 8 has 0% market share ATM.</p>
<p>Definitely its around 1% even before launch.</p>
<p>Even the so-called disastrous Vista has bigger market now than OSX after three years of decline (dropped from 20+%).</p>
<p>What people seem to be forgetting is that a very large portion of enterprises are waiting for WP8 so that they can ditch Blackberry. With the inclusion of management through SCCM2012, domain capabilities, and corporate app stores, WP is going to gobble up a tidy market share indeed.</p>
<p>This is a hipster site, do not confuse them.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re*</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be smart-ass use correct grammar.</p>
<p>Your right. I think that they scheduled it for an earlier date but due to malware and a laggy OS it landed on the twenty-ninth&#8230;.this is when they went ahead and shut down the android tablet that was running there calendar for events and called it good.</p>
<p>How do you know they hadn&#8217;t planned it long ago and just announced it?</p>
<p>Maybe they did, but to me it&#8217;s about being professional. Microsoft announced their event first well in advance. The classy thing to do would be to move theirs just a little.</p>
<p>What google has done here just come off as childish.</p>
<p>Sorry but it doesn&#8217;t come off as childish to me. You don&#8217;t let your competitors dictate your schedule.</p>
<p>If they did deliberately schedule at the same time, that&#8217;s their choice and a valid business strategy.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing a vital bit of information, but the original WP8 launch was going to be part of the overall Microsoft Launch event (windows8, Surface, etc) of which I&#8217;m still going to next Friday (26th).</p>
<p>Windows\Surface is on the 26th, WP8 is on the 29th.</p>
<p>Ahh please, let me guess you are MS fan. They announced their last Nexus event around this same time.</p>
<p> This event might be Google&#8217;s version of Apple&#8217;s Game Center for Google Play? You heard it here first ladies and gentlemen; just sayin&#8217; ;-)</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xbNiHge33Qw/UH9f6Sr0lcI/AAAAAAAAQ64/o3pR0jfklTc/s512/Google+Play.jpg" /></p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Version of Apples Version of Microsoft&#8217;s XBL?</p>
<p>This is an old rumor, but would be a new killer feature and proof that Android can innovate at a faster pace than Apple.</p>
<p>You got the colors wrong. Apple used the Windows flag colors in the exact order, except they have the 2 yellow squares on the red part. Google would go ahead and copy the Windows flag colors in the exact order.  <br />
<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e6/Game_Center_logo.png" /><br />

<p>Because Microsoft clearly own Red, Green, Blue and Orange.</p>
<p>Because an icon or trademark is clearly defined by just the colours it uses.</p>
<p>Sometimes, yes. ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/blog/2007/11/04/beware-t-mobile-owns-the-color-magenta/" target="_blank">http://www.colourlovers.com/blog/2007/11/04/beware-t-mobile-owns-the-color-magenta/</a></p>
<p>Hah. That is ridiculous :-)</p>
<p>Um&#8230;I was more than sure the Motorola event was a Verizon event. So that would be Verizon more so than Motorola.</p>
<p>Google Now looks eerily familiar&#8230; WP live tiles. Imitation is the best form of flattery I suppose. Looks pretty sharp, I&#8217;m checking this out for sure.</p>
<p>How do they look like live tiles? I don&#8217;t really see it at all except that they&#8217;re rectangular.</p>
<p>There you are then. It&#8217;s <em>obvious</em>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a picture?</p>
<p>Its more like Microsoft&#8217;s fault for announcing the date like half a year ago. Other companies don&#8217;t wait half a year to release products for a reason. It will let competitors to have time to react to your product.</p>
<p>Its like on a football field, where your goalkeeper left on box, and the ball is right in front of the goal, its not the opponents fault to kick the ball into the goal.</p>
<p>Plus Google always announce their flagship phone end of the year in October mostly</p>
<p>Who cares? The more competition and events the better. Its exciting to have multiple events to look forward to.</p>
<p>Thankfully I could give two shits less about whatever garbage Microsoft is trying to peddle.</p>
<p>I agree to a point. It&#8217;s obvious that Google is being, well, obvious about the competition of WP even though it&#8217;s not anywhere near Android in the mobile space.<br />
However I think this is great in a way. Battle of the best in my opinion. This happened last time with the Nokia event and it&#8217;s largely agreed that the Nokia event was more interesting than the Motorola event. Hell even the Nokia event had controversy and that made more headlines than the Motorola phones. <br />
At this point it&#8217;s also largely agreed that MS might have killed all the hype for WP8 by not showing the consumer features back in June/July. If there aren&#8217;t any new features to show on the 29th, IMO I think google deserves to have all the attention that day. <br />
I say this being the proud owner of a Lumia 900 and soon Lumia 920.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a dumb move for Google. 1.) It legitimizes WinPhone as a competitor by attacking it. 2.) It gives Microsoft even more incentive to try to win the news cycle again. The Sr. Director of Marketing for Microsoft is taking note of this publicly on Twitter. 3.) There&#8217;s going to be some less coverage for both events because journalists are divided covering both.</p>
<p>Microsoft has nothing to lose in the mobile space. Google has a lot more to lose.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like purposely throwing a party for a group of friends at the same time someone else is throwing a party, it&#8217;s kind of a dick move.</p>
<p>Pathetic like a fox.</p>
<p>no to mention the rumored wireless charging in this next Nexus. Lumia 920 too much?</p>
<p>Why would the company with the leading phone software be insecure about the company with the distant-third phone software?</p>
<p>Google probably tried to find a day in October/November when MS <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> launching something W8/WRT/WP8-related, and there wasn&#8217;t one.</p>
<p>I totally agree man. It&#8217;s not like MS is making millions off of Android with lame patent agreements right or releasing direct ads to compare Google search to Bing or printing ads saying how Google is misusing our data to promote themselves. I mean its the only thing that would warranty such a low blow from Google. Oh wait?&#8230;</p>
<p>I see it as them completely disregarding windows phone as a competitor.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a competitive tactic, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s pathetic.   What I think is pathetic is the way Microsoft extorts money from Android OEMs in the form of &#8220;license agreements&#8221; to prevent them from going to court over their &#8220;intellectual property&#8221;.</p>
<p>Limelight? Gaslight maybe :) Though you&#8217;re right, if Google feels the need to actually compete with MSFT, as opposed to just turning the knife&#8217; that is pathetic. How the mighty have fallen eh? Back in 95 they had the stones, now they have tap dancing&#8230;</p>
<p>You know, I think Google should release two Nexus Q models at $99 and $199 for example (or how ever much the difference in cost to produce would be). They should be mostly, if not completely identical in features, the only thing separating the two models should be the place of manufacturing. They exist right now as an experiment and as an attempt to bring more manufacturing back to the US. But it&#8217;s definitely too expensive right now, compared to how much a Roku costs for example.</p>
<p><em>If</em> they were able to bring the US production cost down to a reasonable price, I don&#8217;t see why they shouldn&#8217;t release two identical models, but make it <em> completely clear</em> to people buying them what the only difference is &#8211; manufacturing location. It&#8217;s not a cash-cow for Google &#8211; I doubt they&#8217;re making any real money off the Nexus Q project right now. As I said before it&#8217;s an experiment. This would ensure more adopters, since people that thought it simply was too expensive before can now buy it, but people who think the fact that it&#8217;s produced in the US is the most important can still buy one of those.</p>
<p>Everybody wins.</p>
<p>or randomly decided to sell it at a huge loss and somehow make up profits selling content&#8230; I mean, you have to have gotten the content it uses from google anyway, so they might be planning on that down the line maybe?<br />
idk, I doubt it&#8217;ll ever be that cheap</p>
<blockquote>you have to have gotten the content it uses from google anyway</blockquote>
<p>I think this is incorrect information.</p>
<p>The Q could be the ultimate &#8220;Android on a stick&#8221; peripheral.</p>
<p>I would be fine to pay $199 if it handled all the media streaming it does now, add Google TV (which should not add any cost to hardware, right?).</p>
<p>One of the few features I am jealous of iOS users is Airplay.  Google, please make it dead simple to share media between Android devices.</p>
<p>This is what I&#8217;m jealous of. Which is why I want a $99 Nexus Q.</p>
<p>Yeah, Google needs an Air Play alternative or at least try to get manufacturers of accessories to jump on the NFC+Bluetooth Pairing bandwagon.</p>
<p>and accessories.</p>
<p>LOADS of accessories for any apple product.</p>
<p>im struggling to find a folio to keep my nexus 7 and documents together in  my bag.</p>
<p>Multiples of Nexus is just Nexus.</p>
<p>Nexuses</p>
<p>Nexii.</p>
<p>Well, this was informative.</p>
<p>Now all we need is Amazon to hold an event for a phone and all four big names/ecosystems will be revealing something in the span of a week.</p>
<p>Facebook has an event that week?</p>
<p>Lets hope they give it something other than the QuickTime logo&#8230;</p>
<p>The plural of Nexus is Nexus. As awkward as that sounds.</p>
<p><img src="http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i57/2/10/17/frabz-One-One-Nexus-Two-Two-Nexus-Three-Three-Nexus-Theyre-are-all-Nex-6e7ca4.jpg" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so awkward.  The pronunciation is more like &#8220;one nexus&#8221;, &#8220;two nexoos&#8221;.  So there&#8217;s at least some difference, albeit not in the spelling.</p>
<p>Nexusen.</p>
<p>Nexi</p>
<p>interesting. But you don&#8217;t think nexoos sounds awkward? neck-soos&#8230; neck-soos&#8230; Nek-sooohs&#8230;</p>
<p>Nexae</p>
<p>either nexi, or nexii. its latin, 2nd declination</p>
<p>I hope for a better interface with an Airplay equivalent and third party apps.<br />
But looking at the invite, it seems like Google Now will get a few more features no?</p>
<p>The playground is open could be interpreted as multiple nexuses.</p>
<p>Poor Windows 8 announcement. :(</p>
<p>*Windows Phone 8</p>
<p>Well if this turns out like the lame Motorola press conference on Lumia day, then I think we&#8217;ll be saying poor Android again.</p>
<p>The Verizon DROID RAZR MAXX HD LTE is certainly not a Google Nexus. Just look at the names. This aint a Verizon event, this is the big boys. Don&#8217;t think this is going to be anything like Moto</p>
<p>Well, Motorola didn&#8217;t have to fake anything at their press conference.</p>
<p>Calling it the biggest event of the day was a pretty big fake out to everyone in the media.</p>
<p>Except they didn&#8217;t need to bullshit what their products actually do.</p>
<p>No all the shit was reserved for the products themselves.</p>
<p>That explains why big bird was wearing gloves I take it.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/5310746/axv1734_large_verge_medium_landscape.jpg" /></p>
<p>The only BS here is your comment b/c the functionality is proven to be real, what more do you need to see?</p>
<p>A White Van, A Steady Cam and a Sound guy. But, that comes bundled with every Lumia 920, right.</p>
<p>Neither did Nokia. Their product does what it is said to do. The ad that was &#8220;faked&#8221; was a demonstration of OIS technology, a technology that is found only in the 920 when it comes to phones, but everyone got their undies all bunched up and cried foul. There have been many videos and demos of the 920 and all it&#8217;s pureview technology being precisely what Nokia has billed.</p>
<p>Then they should have shown what it could actually do instead of hiring 3 guys and a white van to simulate it.</p>
<p>Droid RAZR M <strong>the fullscreen phone</strong>. Right&#8230;</p>
<p>leave the Droid alone, I feel sorry for it.</p>
<p>Between the new iPhone 5,  Galaxy S3, new Galaxy S3 Mini, iPad mini, Kindle Fire HD, Nexus 7, Nexus 4,  $99 Nexus tablet&#8230;.Windows 8 and WP8 will not going to gain any significant market share.</p>
<p>The Galaxy SIII Mini is the last gen one right? Why is it in that group?</p>
<p>I think Windows 8 and WP8 will surprise us. (Whether it&#8217;s a good surprise is still up in the air.) Windows 8 will gain significant market share, but it might not matter. WP8 is finally on currently gen hardware, and I think it has a great chance of increasing its user base, but probably won&#8217;t set the world alight with its market share.</p>
<p>Regardless, just like Apple of a decade ago, they don&#8217;t need to have more than 5% to be successful.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft has sent a panic through the likes of Apple and Google. With Lumia 920, HTC 8X, Surface, there is a reason they are all rushing to get a product in before Windows lands.</p>
<p>Apple nor Google is going to flinch at ANYTHING from Microsoft. WP8 isnt gonna do any significant numbers and there market share isn&#8217;t gonna move strides either. Apple and Google has the mobile game on lock, and Apple is steadily taking the PC market away from Microsoft&#8230;</p>
<p>Good point but if companies think like you, they will never be successful.  You really think Apple ang Google are not scared of Microsoft having the holiday season to themselves? You must be kidding. They either try and jump in with products or risk losing significantly to new Windows devices.  But any way, if they happen to attempt announcing that LG Nexus we read about, it will be even more one sided than we saw on 5th September.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get surprised that some people simply don&#8217;t realize a simple fact: it&#8217;s Windows. Doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s good or bad, Windows 8 will sell millions and millions on the first weekend. Just because it&#8217;s Windows. Every single new computer will come with it.<br />
Six months from now, a very significant part of the consumers will already be familiar with Metro, and all the UI Microsoft is introducing. When these consumers come to a store, don&#8217;t think they will look at Windows Phone 8 like they did with WP7. Just because now, they will know Metro. This changes everything.</p>
<p>Consumers are going to <strong>detest</strong> Windows 8 on their new computers.  Microsoft risks backlash and negative sentiment towards Windows Phone that wouldn&#8217;t have existed in the absence of W8.</p>
<p>The door swings both ways.</p>
<p>Dear Oracle, foretell my private future too pls :D</p>
<p>Nobody likes Windows.</p>
<p>False</p>
<p>I love OS X but it it not remotely taking away marketshare from, MS in total.</p>
<p>In the consumer market it&#8217;s growing, but the enterprise will continue to dominate.</p>
<p>Symbian may be panicking, but I really doubt Apple or Google are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to miss you people when WP8 fails and you all slope off in embarassment.</p>
<p>Serious question. What&#8217;s so great about nexus devices. Other then the nexus one the build quality for them haven&#8217;t been that great, the battery haven&#8217;t been good at all, and the cameras aren&#8217;t good either. I know because my buddy had one. Ohh and god forbid you get it through a carrier then it will take forever for upgrades</p>
<blockquote>What’s so great about nexus devices</blockquote>
<p>Pure Android experience, quick updates, Google support, no bloatware, gets better over time, and many other reasons</p>
<p>Yea&#8230;unless it isn&#8217;t a Verizon carrier model.</p>
<p>Unlocked.</p>
<p>A verizon nexus is still better than any other non nexus device. They are only second to an unlocked nexus.</p>
<p>The vzw GNex isn&#8217;t really a Nexus. It&#8217;s more of a DROID, labelled as a Nexus.</p>
<p>Essentially (and unfortunately), what most Android phones are not.</p>
<p>Lmao, bloatware . I thought that&#8217;s what android was all about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not logical to apply what you&#8217;ve seen with your friend to all users. I&#8217;ve gotten the Nexus One, Nexus S, and now I have the Galaxy Nexus and I just love it. Big, clear, and super responsive screen, direct OTA updates, beautiful design compared to others and most of all it&#8217;s untouched by manufacturer. Pure Android, pure Google, pure clean experience.</p>
<p>Camera is great for me, battery lasts for a day and a half or only one day when heavy HSPA+ usage. It&#8217;s a fantastic phone.</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus on Sprint&#8230; plenty of updates so far (and insanely easy to root if I want them faster). Falls on concrete only make small, unnoticeable scratches, and curved screen means it&#8217;s very tough to crack if it falls on a flat surface. Battery life is at least a day. The camera sure could be better, but it&#8217;s plenty fine for my needs.<br />
Do more research, or get better friends.</p>
<p>Well, the Galaxy Nexus is still arguably the best phone in the market a year on, and each software update only makes it better.</p>
<p>The editor in chief would certainly tell you that.</p>
<p>I much prefer my iPhone 4 to my Galaxy Nexus, but would totally support the notion that Android is the mainstream market choice barring Apple, and that the current Nexus device will be the best available.</p>
<blockquote>Serious question. What’s so great about nexus devices.</blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ve asked this several times in Nexus articles. Give it a rest.</p>
<p>The end of this month is turning out to be sick&#8230;3 major tech companies betting the farm on new concepts</p>
<p>Realllllllly hoping that if this is a hardware announcement the Galaxy Nexus price drops even more. I have the Verizon model and my contract is up soon. May be time to jump ship to a budget prepaid carrier like Straight Talk or get on that $30 T-Mo plan since I almost never actually talk on the phone.</p>
<p>All I ask for is phone similar to the S3&#8217;s specs, with stock android. I don&#8217;t care who makes the thing to be honest, as long as I get a great screen, a better camera than the Galaxy Nexus, and great battery.</p>
<p>Trololololol?</p>
<p>hard to say. MS knew Google would have the event towards the end of october&#8230;</p>
<p>all i know is that The Verge is going to be stretched lol</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be fine, josh will go to the google even and the rest of the staff will go to the apple event and finish the week off talking about the ipad mini&#8230; /s</p>
<p>They simply have to defrost 3 clones of Mr. Topolsky and send them to the Google, Microsoft and Apple events.</p>
<p>he will go to Apple and Google event i bet you.</p>
<p>Tom and Ross and maybe Dan Seifert will go to MS event</p>
<p>Ahah ! &#8220;Get your little Topolsky action figure !&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmm actually it sounds pretty creepy typing this :D</p>
<p>I hope Topolsky does not go to any MS event, cuz he is completely ignorant at that area.</p>
<p>Oh please&#8230;</p>
<p>Grow up.</p>
<p>Why, cuz you are a Topolsky fanboy? Don&#8217;t tell that he is an MS expert&#8230; (I don&#8217;t even consider him as a tech expert) &#8230; because that would be the joke of the year.</p>
<p>So because he doesn&#8217;t use it as his daily OS and doesn&#8217;t like many things about it that makes him completely ignorant?</p>
<p>What platforms do you use?</p>
<p>No, he is telling bullshit in articles, thats what it makes him look ignorant.</p>
<p>Android 4 and Windows 7/8. But why is that relevant?</p>
<p>So you don&#8217;t use iOS/OS X, I assume that makes you completely ignorant about them?</p>
<p>Pray tell what this &#8216;bullshit in articles&#8217; is.</p>
<p>Yea, I do not consider myself an iOS/OSX expert, and this is why I wouldn&#8217;t make any article about them, because probably I would make myself look stupid. Contrary, that&#8217;s exactly what he has done serveral times.</p>
<blockquote>Yea, I do not consider myself an iOS/OSX expert</blockquote>
<p>Is very different phrasing to &#8216;completely ignorant&#8217;.</p>
<p>I could say I was ignorant to write a good article.</p>
<p>WayAway &#8211; Other than to annoy the hell out of trololler, what exactly is your point?</p>
<p>To point out how absurd he was/is, waste of time of course.</p>
<p>josh is a terrific journalist and is very opinionated but most of his opinions in regards to Microsoft are not based on facts.</p>
<p>For example he was saying how first gen windows phones had 128 or 256 MB of ram, but they clearly had 512 MB which at the time was the highest on any smartphone and maybe 6-10 months later android phones arrived with 1GB of RAM.</p>
<p>He doesnt like microsoft which is understandable as these things are a matter of choice. but for reviewing/reporting on a product, you need to have a complete understanding of the product.</p>
<p>when he review the Lumia 900, he didnt know about Zune pass or Office integration, this is not me accusing, he said it in the vergecast which is available for people to go and listen.</p>
<p>I love josh. i like his humor, jokes and the direction he is choosing for The Verge. But as a Microsoft fan and as a gadget fan in general, i dont think he should review microsoft products, specially when there are more experience editors in regards to MS products on the verge team.</p>
<p>If David Pierce, Tom Warren, Ross Miller, Sean, Dan or even Dieter Bone review WP8 devices, i&#8217;ll be happy, dont get me wrong, i love to know Josh&#8217;s opinion on WP8 devices, but I dont want him to review it.</p>
<p>but if he decides to, im just gonna read it with a large bag of salt.</p>
<p>&quot; he doesn’t use it as his daily OS&quot; <br />
This is one factor, yes.</p>
<p>Verge Bunshin no Jutsu! :D</p>
<p>Remember when they &#8220;spontaneously&#8221; had their Verizon event on the same day as Nokia &amp; Microsofts?  Everybody is getting mighty antsy for something thats supposed to be a huge failure and flop (WP8 &amp; W8).</p>
<p>exciting times!</p>
<p>More <strong>Google Now</strong> awesomeness please</p>
<p><img src="http://androidandme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/google-now.png" /></p>
<p>Where did you find this? My Google Now doesn&#8217;t look like this.</p>
<p>looks like the image is from here: <a href="http://androidandme.com/2012/07/applications/video-highlights-google-now-capabilities-with-47-questions/">http://androidandme.com/2012/07/applications/video-highlights-google-now-capabilities-with-47-questions/</a></p>
<p>looks like WP7</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t:<br />
<img src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/5224654/google_now_update_cards_large_verge_medium_landscape.jpg" /></p>
<p>check out google before and after introduction of WP7 and Metro design language and you will see how much influence WP has had on android.</p>
<p>believe me, i know. I have a galaxy Nexus!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for the next Nexus! :D</p>
<p>The playground is open = multiple nexus?</p>
<p>Hopefully one by HTC!</p>
<p>With the glorious screen from that 5 inch HTC J Butterfly they just showed off in Japan last night?</p>
<p>Swoon.</p>
<p>stop it, you&#8217;re making me all hot and bothered.</p>
<p>Oh Yes! Please.</p>
<p>Oh baby yeah!</p>
<p>Same screen but cut smaller.</p>
<p>Just as dense, but lower res/size.</p>
<p>likely!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s been their slogan to promote the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Relating to Android&#8217;s opensource&#8217;ness&#8217;? thought that was old news</p>
<p>What? Why on earth would it be referring to that? They&#8217;re trying to sell phones, not impress a Linux convention.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to dream.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll just be the Nexus4 this side of Christmas, else we&#8217;d have heard leaks (not the Sony Nexus X fake) maybe another phone next quarter.</p>
<p>Nexus 7 storage bumps</p>
<p>Android 4.2 with further tweaks, mainly security.</p>
<p>Google Now becoming even more powerful.</p>
<p>If you can come up with a connect their you can draw a line between any two items and come to the answer you want to hear.</p>
<p>The event is taking place at Basketball City in lower east side NYC.</p>
<p>Could the Basketball courts location and the playground slogan be related?</p>
<p>Updated Google Now, 4.2 update, and new Nexus 4 along with Nexus 7 prices decreases (Storage bumps).</p>
<p>Sounds incredible.</p>
<p>Maybe&#8230; but 4.1.2 was JUST released, so I guess they&#8217;ll announce a few features at least. Should be interesting to see how they follow up the Apple event and the release of Win8/Surface RT.</p>
<p>there is usually a tiny bug fix update before the big one</p>
<p>Wow, and I thought September was an overwhelming month!<br />
I wonder if the invitation&#8217;s Google Now style means anything.</p>
<p>I think that metro, flat thing is their jam now like Microsoft</p>
<p>IB El Goog announcing 32GB Nexus 7, fully revamped Nexus Q and 3 Nexus phones. Everyone goes crazy.</p>
<p>But will the final Nexus Q be indeed assembled in the US?</p>
<p>I think it will be hard to get it priced the way it should be while assembled in the US. I wouldn&#8217;t say $99, but maybe around $129 to $149.</p>
<p>And, oh yeah, they end the event by saying: &#8220;Oh, and I almost forgot, you can start pre-ordering all of these things right now. Shipping in two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then the whole internet crashes. Forever.</p>
<p>Dude it&#8217;s still waaay too early to think the nexus Q is coming back, it just got released and recalled over the summer.</p>
<p>Here comes the new Nexus.</p>
<p>Nexi?</p>
<p>One can hope so.</p>
<p>Nexus is a 4th declension latin word. Thus, the plural of Nexus is Nexus.</p>
<p>I be a grammar <strike>nazi</strike> roman.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to google that word, hold my coat.</p>
<p>Yep, I get what you&#8217;re saying&#8230; have never studied latin, but I believe you would be right there. Technically.</p>
<p>you should bing it&#8230; you&#8217;ll get a better answer /troll</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what that means. But I want to. Please inform me.</p>
<p>Nouns have &#8220;declensions&#8221; which tell you how to add endings to form thoughts.</p>
<p>agricola is the latin word for farmer. So the Latin word for multiple farmers is agricolae. The word for &#8220;to the farmers&#8221; is argicolam.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agricola" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agricola</a> if you want to read more.</p>
<p>Agricolam is the singular accusative, not the dative plural. You&#8217;re looking for agricolis (where the second i is long).</p>
<p>&#8220;Romani ite domum&#8221; (&#8220;Romans go home&#8221; &#8211; Monty Python/Life Of Brian reference)</p>
<p>&#8220;Pie Jesu domine, dona eis requiem. /Smack/&#8221; (More Monty Python)</p>
<p>LOL I&#8217;d forgotten all about that one. Hilarious&#8230; I love Monty Python.</p>
<p>Was wondering this, <br />
have no idea what 4th declension latin word means but it sounds legit</p>
<p>In language you conjugate verbs and decline nouns. If you&#8217;ve ever studied a foreign language you might remember learning verb charts that tell you the ending of each verb. Same thing happens with nouns.</p>
<p>Source: Studied Latin for a little</p>
<p>You should see all the noun declensions in Finnish and and Estonian (15 in Finnish and 14 in Estonian, I think). Truly a sight to behold&#8230;</p>
<p>*remove one of the &#8220;ands&#8221; (need edit button).</p>
<p>Thank you. I love you.</p>
<p>I always thought it was in the first, but if you bother to post it here, I&#8217;ll believe you ;)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nexus#Latin" target="_blank">http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nexus#Latin</a><br />
Looking at this, it could either be 2nd declension: so Nexi<br />
or 4th declension: so Nexus<br />
Everyone&#8217;s right!</p>
<p>yeaaaaaaaaaaa&#8230;.I really hope we see multiple nexus devices..</p>
<p>Every time I see Google Now stuff, I think of it like a command. Google NOW</p>
<p>Serenity NOW!</p>
<p>Netscape NOW!</p>
<p>I always think of Spaceballs. <br />
&#8220;When?&#8221; <br />
&#8220;Just now. We&#8217;re at now, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened to then?</p>
<p>We passed then.</p>
<p>When?</p>
<p>Android 4.2 here we come</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to love how all these companies cluster their announcement so close to each other&#8217;s. It&#8217;s time for Tech Announcements- Fall Edition!</p>
<p>So how many new nexus?</p>
<p>So far the ones I believe are the Nexus 4 by LG and I dearly hope for a nexus 5 by HTC and of course the new nexus 7 prices and storage sizes.</p>
<p>I still hold out hope that Sony have a nexus device of some kind.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why does google have to have its events on the same day as the the windows phone events ?</p>
<p>Because if they can steal a competitor&#8217;s thunder, why wouldn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>Exactly, it is a good business move.</p>
<p>Holy cow, this month is getting better and better!</p>
<p>Hopefully Eric Schmidt pulls a Steve Jobs and orders 400 coffees for The Verge staff. They&#8217;ll surely need it!</p>
<p>And makes some more&#8230; interesting statements</p>
<p>When did Steve Jobs ever do anything like that? Not saying he didn&#8217;t, just can&#8217;t recall.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SaBjMHtQqo" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SaBjMHtQqo</a></p>
<p>Too excited! We all know it&#8217;ll most likely have something to do with the Nexus phones but I really hope they have some Nexus 7 news at the event.</p>
<p>Omg omg omg. It&#8217;s the new Nexus phone.<br />

<p>Boom goes the dynamite&#8230;.</p>
<p>Google will surprise me with a HTC J Butterfly Nexus?</p>
<p>In our dreams.</p>
<p>:-(</p>
<p>Wet dreams&#8230;</p>
<p>I was hoping this was a Google Now Easter Egg. But instead, all I got was playgrounds on a map.</p>
<p>Disappointed.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>Holy crap. Most epic tech fortnight ever?!?</p>
<p>Is that invite interactive?</p>
<p>Anyone know how to attend? Would love to see this in person.</p>
<p>U need to be part of press and be invited&#8230;.</p>
<p>Not allowed but like all Google events its gonna be streamed on YouTube in 720p.</p>
<p>OMG WHAT CAN IT BE!? Nexus iPhone!?!?!</p>
<p>I think a Nexus iPhone would cost at least 800 dollars because the demand would be that intense.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t this happen back in June with the Surface/Windows Phone 8 week and Google I/O the week after?</p>
<p>And Apple&#8217;s event just a couple weeks before both of those. It&#8217;s like they planned this together&#8230;</p>
<p>Hopefully we can all get a slice of some Key Lime Pie</p>
<p>Doubt it, just 4.2 with beefed up Linux security &amp; app security too as per the 4.2 rom leaks on AndroidPolice. <br />
Obviously will be some user noticeable tweaks too, but I doubt KLP</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t gone through the whole 4.2 dump yet (lol)</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s teardown was about security but what about the other days? Or have you forgotten about the quick settings. And at the end of the security tear down they said something about a new gallery and some other things. So they haven&#8217;t gone trough the whole update yet.</p>
<p>Hopefully 4.2 includes some innovative features for Google Now &#8212; they are using it as the invitation.</p>
<p>I want Google Now <em>as</em> my lock screen, not just accessible from my lock screen!</p>
<p>Thank you El Goog.</p>
<p>Yes yes yes! I&#8217;m waiting with credit card in hand! Hopefully the Nexus 4 same day via Play Store and Gnex and nexus 7 updates. Make this a good holiday quarter el goog!</p>
<p>Oct 23, iPad Mini.<br />
Oct 26, WIndows 8.<br />
Oct 29, Android + Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re forgetting Microsoft&#8217;s BUILD conference, which is also October 30 &#8211; November 2.  Probably not many big announcements there since it&#8217;s after the other two Microsoft events, but you never know.</p>
<p>Apple should put off their Mini announcement for a week.<br />
Move it to the 29th as well.<br />
Just to show their Marketing muscle.  &#8220;You other guys can announce all the stuff you want, but the cream of the press will come to see us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;cream of the press&#8221;<br />
made my day</p>
<p>Oh dear.  I didn&#8217;t think of it that way.<br />
Well, sometimes they do.</p>
<p>Oct 23, iPad Mini.<br />
 Oct 26, WIndows 8.<br />
 Oct 29, Windows Phone 8+android.</p>
<p>Fixed.</p>
<p>What is the aqua color thing in the sky, just below to the left of the sun?</p>
<p>Oh, it&#8217;s a plane. I thought it was a &#8220;4&#8221;</p>
<p>Bring it on, Google! My credit cards are looking pretty lonely with a zero balance right now!!! Hopefully whatever they announce will be available directly from the Play Store.</p>
<p>Yes!  Ready for Android 4.2!</p>
<p>Comments like this crack me up. 97% of android devices don&#8217;t even have 4.1. 80% don&#8217;t even have 4. Well over 70% are on 2.&#215;.</p>
<p>Enjoy being one of a few hundred thousand people running 4.2 on your either brand new or (possibly maybe) 11 month or less old, carrier unlocked nexus device that no real person owns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile more than one hundred million people are already running iOS 6. (And the maps work just fine here, thanks)</p>
<p>Android is totally winning.</p>
<p>Who cares man, loosen up. Jellybean is awesome, we&#8217;re all waiting for the refresh. If you bought touchwiz instead of android you must have had a reason and would not appreciate jb anyway, you most likely believe scott forestall should be androids lead designer and you love homebuttons. Enjoy your glossy mess and stop whining.</p>
<p>The Apple guy might be trolling and i won&#8217;t deny updates for your OS are always cool, but if Android users are really &#8220;waiting for a refresh&#8221; while Jelly Bean is not even 4 months old&#8230; he might have a point.</p>
<p>software is evolving. 4 months is an awfully long period and realeasing a minor up is about time. this is why you buy android, no?</p>
<p>But what do I care about what other people are running?  I chose that updates matter to me, so I buy Nexus devices.  I don&#8217;t care if every other Android device is stuck on Android 1.6.  Android is about choices, and I chose to be on the bleeding edge of software instead of hardware.</p>
<p>Although with the LG Nexus 4, we&#8217;ll be on the bleeding edge of hardware as well</p>
<p>You know what dude ?</p>
<p>You seem really uptight in there‚ just fart a bit :)</p>
<p>AndroidLove ;)</p>
<p>Lol wut?</p>
<p>Well, he is waiting for a Nexus devices, which guarantees future updates. Your &#8220;stats&#8221; mean nothing in this context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nexus device that no real person owns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you need proof this guy is trolling&#8230; it&#8217;s right here.</p>
<p>Not really. Nexus sales are very low.</p>
<p>hopefully these nexuses/nexi  come subsidized on all carriers</p>
<p>Another event?! I think I just geekgasmed.</p>
<p>And she say, &#8220;Hell yeah. Hell yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fu** Yeah! Google, bring that A game baby or I&#8217;m on the Lumia 920 bandwagon!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve considered the same, actually.</p>
<p>So did I, but then I remembered it ran WP8.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a bandwagon, it&#8217;s real thing. The 920 just has it all</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really curious to see how Google has outdone themselves since the Galaxy Nexus &#8212; although if the rumors of numerous Nexus devices from multiple OEMs are true, then Android&#8217;s <em>pure</em> flagship gets a bit muddled (but, if true, please include HTC,; they&#8217;ve outdone themselves recently). One exciting bit is if the wireless charging is true &#8212; and with Nokia and LG/Google now using a standard &#8212; maybe future phones start to include wireless charging and the prices for charging stations come way down. From the Pre&#8217;s accessories to these new batches, $50 to $100 is quite expensive just to replace a cord. But I&#8217;d like to see the day when <em>every</em> phone has wireless tech &#8212; very convenient and lately I&#8217;ve been misplacing the cord and even dropping my damn phone (straight onto tile) :\</p>
<p>So please enthrall me Google. And usually their Nexus devices ranks amongst the best.</p>
<p><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m52tp39pRc1qdjg8qo4_500.gif" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll troll-late:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the mighty foot of Android crushing the Microsoft event.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>It did last time Motorola (not even real Google) did. By 5pm, Microsoft was at the bottom of the fold. (or off the first page entirely)</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t. You should check Google trends, Motorola failed miserably.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no one talks about the Motorola phone these days.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not at all surprising that there are all of these announcements, since we&#8217;re getting into the holiday gift-buying season. Although&#8230;way to leave it until the last second, everybody.</p>
<p>My question is: how many of these things getting announced will be available within one to two weeks MAXIMUM? We know the iPad mini will be. Anybody else?</p>
<p>The surface rt, and probably other windows 8 devices. And windows phone&#8217;s are seemingly on track to be available around then too. And nexus devices might be too</p>
<p>It would be awesome if they show the entire Nexus lineup and they are given to tech sites for reviews promptly after. They need to release them quickly during the holiday season. I&#8217;d like to see  Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony &amp; LG all make Nexii.  Nokia prob won&#8217;t, at least for now.</p>
<p>But will the &#8220;Nexus 4&#8221; AT LAST have FM radio?<br />
(Many high-end phones don&#8217;t have FM radio &#8211; every iPhone, every Nexus, most high-end Motorola phones&#8230;)</p>
<p>Probably because <em>no one cares</em>. You have local storage and streaming services for music, use them.</p>
<p>But not every mobile network in the world has unlimited data plans.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what the local storage is for.</p>
<p>Go to play store and get an app.</p>
<p>The Tunein app streams local radio.</p>
<p>Bless you. Sadly I think FM radio on phones is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Please have a more compelling Nexus product than the LG one. I literally cannot get myself excited about that thing and I really want you to excite me, Google.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/nexusae0_upload-1_thumb.png" /></p>
<p>love the live-stream.</p>
<p>I know! Verge has a great live-blog but nothing beats live video stream.</p>
<p>Hells yeah! Verge does a good live blog but I&#8217;ll take live stream any day of the week.</p>
<p>Google to Apple and Microsoft: The game starts now.</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t been going on for 4 years already?</p>
<p>Fingers, legs and everything else crossed for a Sony Nexus Phone – iOS is getting pretty boring now.</p>
<p>No kidding. I have a LTE Galaxy Nexus and I can&#8217;t wait to see Google&#8217;s next monster.</p>
<p>Forget Microsoft, forget the overpriced Surface, and the fragmented, confusing versions of Windows 8, I&#8217;m stoked for this Google event! Go Android!</p>
<p>Windows 8 is fragmented?  What the hell does that make Android?</p>
<p>No&#8230;.legacy. Oh wait&#8230;.their the same.</p>
<p>I think we can forget about the 90% of Android phones grouped by  Gingerbread and Froyo phones. Then actually the fragmentation is not that bad :D</p>
<p>Less seriously fragmented?</p>
<p>Lol what? Ignoring the fact that the first part of your sentence doesn&#8217;t even make sense,  why can&#8217;t it be go Android and go Windows Phone?</p>
<p>How does the first part not make sense?</p>
<p>Surface is not overpriced. Windows 8 is not fragmented.</p>
<p>So by &#8220;doesn&#8217;t even make sense&#8221; you mean &#8220;isn&#8217;t true&#8221;?</p>
<p>I had once thought that The Verge only went crazy over Apple events, but I&#8217;m glad to see they&#8217;re not biased. Well, at least everyone except for Nilay, anyways lol</p>
<p>Haha so true. You can see him fight his fanboyism when josh criticizes anything about apple that nilay didnt think to criticize first</p>
<p>Honestly I would say then verge is the least biased blogs by a long shot.</p>
<p>Google Now Hell YEAAAAV</p>
<p>All Nexus shall be revealed.</p>

<p>SAMSUNG GALAXY NEXUS 2 &#8211; WHERE ARE YOU!!!<br />
THE ONLY NEXUS PHONE ANYONE CARES ABOUT!!!!!!!!<br />
I LOVE MY SAMSUNG GOOGLE GALAXY NEXUS, BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED. <br />
IF THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS<br />
1. Make the GALAXY NEXUS 2 look damn sexy (iPhone of htc butterfly japan sexy) anything but sgs3!!! that thing is cheap and ugly as anything! tacky!<br />
2. 8mp camera, good camera, good sensor, good lens!<br />
3. more ram more speed<br />
4. full hd screen<br />
5. some cool nifty features we can use<br />
6. andorid 4.1 or 4.2 stock<br />
7. 1080 screen<br />
and there you have the best phone ever!</p>
<p>I have actually been extremely disappointed in the galaxy nexus.   I find the screen lackluster and fuzzy, the battery to last a horrifically short amount of time (even with the extended battery), calls that mute my microphone at random, and general cheap feeling of the device.  However, it was a nexus device &#8211; and getting jelly bean was awesome.</p>
<p>yeah right, so weird ay because i have heard such mixed views on the galaxy nexus, my one that i got from mobi city has honestly been incredible, no issues to date and man i love the screen ay, one of the crispiest screens i have used. Haha my issues are opposite to yours &#8211; i still don&#8217;t have android 4.1! thats my problem ay</p>
<p>It&#8217;s features could be better (especially the camera) but the screen size is perfect and it never has lag. ever. which frankly is hard to believe for an android phne. I love mine.</p>
<p>The only way I don&#8217;t buy a new Nexus is if its made by Samsung.  I need a break from the company after 3 years of Samsung Android phones.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>1. Please calm down.<br />
2. Specs are dead! Didn&#8217;t you get the memo?</p>
<p>3. You want it to have a HD screen <em>and</em> a 1080 screen? Greedy&#8230;</p>
<p>So many great tech announcements, so little money.</p>
<p>I know that feeling bro..</p>
<p>Great avatar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got 99 problems, but a fat wallet ain&#8217;t one of them.</p>
<p>Interesting.. Really excited for this, as a playground usually has multiple people playing on it. Multiple nexus devices, anyone?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same slogan they used for the Nexus 7 launch.</p>
<p>Stop spoiling everyone&#8217;s fun with your mundane truths!</p>
<p>Something tells me the focus will be the Google Play Store, aka the content store, not necessarily the devices.</p>
<p>Agree think it&#8217;s content based</p>
<p>Imagine if it actually turns out to be that. My god that would be disappointing :|</p>
<p>Multiple Nexus phones. No expanded storage in any of them. Will keep my S3 hahaha</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s this Google company? Never heard of them. I know of Apple and MS. What&#8217;s Android? :-)</p>
<p>The real war begins now Apple empire vs Windows 8.</p>
<p>Microsoft is always late and will be forever. <br />
Apple, google is where the modern smart devices race is &#8230; MS is stuck with their PC era and win 8 is not going to suddenly turn the tide in their favor.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re in for a surprise&#8230; MS has a great product in the Surface. They&#8217;re going to be pushing those hard! I think they&#8217;re going break through with the Surface same way they push their way to the top with Xbox brand.</p>
<p>Windows 8 is going to get everyone on board with their Microsoft app store and MS is definitely going to steer a lot of app develop towards ARM processors either that Intel Midfield architecture will dominate mobile processors. But yeah Windows Phones and Windows 8 are going to be able to sync in almost all the same ways iOS and OS-X gets along. Don&#8217;t forget 90% of computer users still uses Windows.</p>
<p>Google needs a real computer OS and some laptop hardware to compete with Apple and MS. Android apps just aren&#8217;t good enough and Chrome is a non-starter.</p>
<p>&quot; I think they’re going break through with the Surface same way they push their way to the top with Xbox brand.&quot;</p>
<p>You mean it&#8217;s going to take seven years, two generations of product, and initial losses of millions of dollars?</p>
<p>Ooooh that&#8217;s dirty Google, why do you have to follow every Windows Phone event?</p>
<p>Every?</p>
<p>Really? Apple and google both don&#8217;t care about a 3%market share OS.</p>
<p>Last year, their event was hosted by both Google and Samsung,</p>
<p>On the invitation this year, its all Google, with no LG logo in sight. I really hope that implies that there are multiple Nexus devices coming.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an Android fan, but Goog, really, just a little too blatant.<br />
If it turns out to be some minor update to Google Now, it will backfire.</p>
<p>No way this isn&#8217;t the new Nexus event. This is approximately the same date as last year.</p>
<p>October 29th will be the day to end all days. Wow! How are sites going to attend all of these events in one day?</p>
<p>All the staff draw straws. Shortest straw gets first pick of events. Highly scientific stuff.</p>
<p>AND IT&#8217;S JOSH&#8217;S ANNIVERSARY.</p>
<p>Sorry, didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d been reminded for a while.</p>
<p>Current wish list. <br />
Ohh Baby. <br />
Technology overload. <br />
1. XPS ONE 27 Touch maxed out<br />
2. 13 inch mac book pro retina<br />
3. go pro 3 black edition<br />
4. htc butterfly j<br />
5. microsoft surface pro <br />
Ohhh my&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/28542358.jpg" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get doing it the same day. Doesn&#8217;t Google risk doing to themselves what they think they are doing to Microsoft? What if MS blows us out of the water somehow and the majority of the media sets this event off to the side? Just wait one day Google. I guess the real question then is if 4.2 is right around the corner and when these/this device(s) actually launch. Also how long will it take for the Note 2 to get 4.2? Where is my Nexus Note?</p>
<p>I think Google knows the chances of MS blowing anyone out of the water are about 1%. As Nilay says, all the signs are the big secret of WP8 is&#8230;. nothing.</p>
<p>Can I get a 5&quot; 1080p HTC Nexus?<br />
Promise I won&#8217;t ask for anything else this year.</p>
<p>If only it were 4.3&quot; and had a bigger battery, I&#8217;d buy it in a heartbeat!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to punch my mother in the face if they do not release this!</p>
<p>what time is this on in australia anyone who wants to do the math for me as I&#8217;m lazy and it&#8217;s my birthday :)</p>
<p>Oddly, there&#8217;s a Yahoo Answers for <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100307162403AA1awPO" target="new">10am est to Australia</a> which gives you the answer in all the Australian timezones. Keep in mind that we&#8217;re in Daylight Savings Time now, and it looks like you may or may not be. HTH.</p>
<p>The end of this month is going to be insane. There are way too many awesome gadgets coming out.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if they all turned out to be shit?</p>
<p>This is going to be REALLY fierce (and interesting).   All these events and announcements packed near the end of the month, when holiday season is due to be starting soon.  It seems to have already started&#8230;</p>
<p>Please please please let there be multiple Nexus devices.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>It has been over a year since Google purchased SageTV. Sage was such terrific PVR software. I really hope this event utilizes that acquisition&#8217;s assets and knowledge.</p>
<p>A Google TV device with a cable card tuner and DVR would be my next.</p>
<p>Maybe they will announce how they have secretly had Google TV in all the TVs sold this summer, just like Eric Schmidt said. And now they will activate them remotely.</p>
<p>If I could steal everyone else&#8217;s recommend and remotely activate them, I&#8217;d do it for this.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;ve renamed the Google TV program &#8216;Skynet.&#8217;</p>
<p>I wish they would have the cast of yo gabba to come and present the new nexus..  God that would be awesome..  They could even sing and shit..  Amiright</p>
<p>My predictions just for kicks:<br />
Oct 23 Apple iPad mini in different colours (and maybe Mac minis). And just one more thing Retina MBP 13&quot; (please).</p>
<p>Oct 29: Google &#8211; hmmm  &#8211; definitely something voice enabled. Playground &#8220;open&#8221; could be update to Play store to include lots of new content with voice search capability.</p>
<p>Or could be new maps app for iOS and WP8&#8230;</p>
<p>Maps for iOS would be cool but it&#8217;s clearly an Android event. Maps for WP8? Why bother?</p>
<p>My guess is updates to Google Now, Intro the Nexus Program, tell us storage bumps to Nex 7, and then show off the LG Nexus.  I&#8217;m thinking there will only be one phone to announce right now, but maybe they&#8217;ll tease more coming in early 2013.</p>
<p>Aside from hopefully alluding to multiple Nexus manufacturer&#8217;s with &#8220;playground is open&#8221; tagline, I hope that it also alludes to an open API system for Google Now. I think since Siri debuted the biggest request has been for it and by extension GNow has been an open API to integrate into other people&#8217;s apps. It would be a huge step for Google to do this before Apple and I&#8217;d love to see what great app designers could do with access to a comprehensive service like Google Now. Just off the top of my head, it could instantly yield a Passbook competitor.</p>
<p>If they are going to release multiple nexus Devices this is what should happen IMO:</p>
<p>1 . Galaxy Nexus with newer hardware. (dual core s4, 8mp camera). Unlocked for $199-$250 max.<br />
2. Mid range Sony nexus X. (Dual Core s4, 32 &#8211; 64GB, 13mp camera). Unlocked for $299-$350 max (32gb).<br />
3. High End LG device that has leaked (Quad core, 2gb ram etc&#8230;). Unlocked for $399-$450 max.<br />
4. High End HTC Device based on the butterfly or whatever. Unlocked for $499-$550 max.<br />
5. All of these devices need to be offered on carriers in the US subsidized as well. ($49.99-$199.99)<br />
6. Release date needs to be within a month of announcement (None of the Verizon G-Nex bullshit)<br />
7. Sell unlocked models at retail stores (Best Buy, Amazon, Radio Shack, etc&#8230;) and on Play store.</p>
<p>On a side note I would like to see Google TV Version 3. I love it as it is but there are still bugs. and it needs more apps.</p>
<p>Yes, I want to see specific release dates&#8230;none of this &#8216;ships in mid quarter 4&#8217; garbage.  Give me a specific date!</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons Apple is so successful. They announce products that other than a few exceptions come out within 2 weeks.</p>
<p>Google actually sold the GNexus at retail stores in the UK, and it never worked. They just didn&#8217;t stand out.</p>
<p>They stood out as being obnoxiously huge. I met one GNex owner who said he&#8217;d never have ordered it if he&#8217;d realised just how vast it is.</p>
<p>heh watch Microsoft whip out the Surface phone. Game over.</p>
<p>yeah, that probably would put them under.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s wittily implying that the Surface tablet will lose money.</p>
<p>everyones tryna cock block windows 8.</p>
<p>Why on the same date as Microsoft? It&#8217;s gonna be media overload.</p>
<p>it didnt used to be like this but apparently these major corps are trying to outdo each other.</p>
<p>Really Google? Windows 8/Lumia 920/Surface FTW!</p>
<p>Yeah, MS is definitely building their ecosystem up! Having a Lumia 920 and a Surface would be pretty sweet! They&#8217;re probably going to continue to integrate Xbox into the equation as well. MS is definitely not out of the game. They got a lot of commendable tools to work with and enough money to blow to make stuff happen.</p>
<p>I really feel the Microsoft supporters on the Verge are becoming more thoughtful recently.</p>
<p>I thought the whole Sony thing was determined to be a fake? Anyways, looks like the 29th is going to have a little of something for everyone. Microsoft fans are going to hear about WP8 and Android fans are going to hear about Android&#8230;.what&#8217;s the big deal if they hold an event on the same day? As far as I can tell, they&#8217;re going to have different audiences. I&#8217;ll be curious which coverage will be splashed more on the The Verge front page, however.</p>
<p>Anyways exciting times regardless! I&#8217;m actually quite excited that it&#8217;s not a OEM joint event (like Samsung and Googles unpacked event last year), which means we&#8217;ll probably see updates to the Nexus 7 and then LG&#8217;s Nexus unveiled.</p>
<p>The Google now playground is open? Sounds like they&#8217;re launching a google now api, which would be awesome!</p>
<p>Or something like the long ignored Playstation Suite thingie will be folded into core Android.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it will be Nexus.  It ought to be something big enough to steal a bit of blog headline space from MS, but nothing that actually <em>matters</em> that is okay being overshadowed by MS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The playground is open&#8221; was the slogan used to advertise the Nexus 7. This event will surely have a Nexus announcement but it probably won&#8217;t be the only thing.</p>
<p>Awesome cant wait</p>
<p>been waiting for this. count me in for the next nexus device, sight unseen</p>
<p>Does it bother anyone else that the &#8220;search bar&#8221; is not centered?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s going to be a 32GB Nexus 7 and possibly a price drop of the 8GB and 16GB to fit the 32GB, that would sell me a tablet easily. Don&#8217;t disappoint, Google!</p>
<p>I can peek thru my Windows 8 and see whats going on in this playground.</p>
<p>Just give me LTE &amp; 32GB of storage. Make this contract on Verizon worth its last year.</p>
<p>If there is a new OS version announced, here are my predictions:</p>
<p>1) Some copy of Game Center<br />
2) Some copy of Passbook<br />
3) Some copy of Flyover<br />
4) Some copy of Apple&#8217;s Turn By Turn gorgeous design<br />
5) Some copy of Airplay</p>
<p>Before the personal attacks commence, make sure you copy/bookmark this list somewhere so that you can see who was correct.</p>
<blockquote>1) Some copy of Game Center<br />
2) Some copy of Passbook<br />
3) Some copy of Flyover<br />
4) Some copy of Apple’s Turn By Turn gorgeous design<br />
5) Some copy of Airplay</blockquote>
<p>1)Wouldn&#8217;t mind, though I would prefer it come from a 3rd party like a real Steam for Android.<br />
2)Does it do any more than Key Ring? I&#8217;m not terribly familiar with passbook.<br />
3)Google Earth<br />
4)I like our turn-by-turn<br />
5)DLNA</p>
<p>Going to throw a hail mary here and say they&#8217;re going to announce Key Lime Pie.</p>
<p>Apple and Google are both trolling Microsoft.   And the sad part is, it&#8217;ll work,  the Apple invite go more news hits than the surface pricing.</p>
<p>Google is probably trolling Microsoft, but please leave Apple out of this.</p>
<p>I have been reading rumors of late 2012/late October iPad Mini launch since Dec 2011. From a quick search, here is an article from May of this year:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/7inch-ipad-mini-track-october-release-200-price-point" target="_blank">http://www.imore.com/7inch-ipad-mini-track-october-release-200-price-point</a></p>
<p>And the Oct 29 date for Google has been floating around the internet for months. The Nexus event is always around late October.</p>
<p>No, its already a strike two for Google beginning with Google/Motorola event timing in the same date as Microsoft/Nokia&#8217;s. This is starting to look less of a coincidence.</p>
<p>Anyway, Google and Motorola looked pretty dumb and cheap going head to head with the runaway winners of the day last September.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t assume Google chose the Motorola date. Their PR is pretty seperate. Schmidt was there but he has nothing to do except talk crap at events. It&#8217;s not like Page was on stage.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if you said &#8220;The playground is open&#8221; into Google Now</p>
<p>Whoa. Nexus owners, try!</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45677595/Screenshot_2012-10-17-20-50-17.png" /></p>
<p>Booooooring</p>
<p>So, there&#8217;s no credible leak to make me think there are multiple Nexus devices. But I&#8217;m hoping the phrase, &#8220;The playground is open&#8221; lends to the idea that the Nexus program is &#8220;open&#8221; to other OEMs.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>perfect sense, that&#8217;s it really</p>
<p>Hopefully they have more to show than pinch to zoom in Gmail.</p>
<p>Well, &#8220;the playground is open&#8221; seems to suggest multiple Nexus phones and it just being a certification.</p>
<blockquote>The event&#8217;s timing is significant for being on the same day as Microsoft&#8217;s own Windows Phone 8 launch, something that doesn&#8217;t seem to weigh too heavily on the minds in Mountain View.</blockquote>
<p>I bet the Verge Team is going to have a blast.</p>
<p>I think Windows RT might have been successful if Microsoft had priced the surface at about 299. They don&#8217;t need to make a profit right away. They need to get market share. If they don&#8217;t have market share, they won&#8217;t gain enough developer support to put it in parity with Apple. As far as WP8, I don&#8217;t  think it will gain much traction.</p>
<p>Yes, you do need to make a profit, going low like Google and Amazon gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>I think WP8&#8217;s success also depends on the success of Windows 8 and the surface. If Windows 8 catches on, WP8 has a really good chance, considering a couple of OEMs are now onboard. Windows RT tablets look a lot more polished and thought out than any other, even the iPad, and that is minus the Surface Pro which promises more. Just the right branding and advertising can make the Surface the ultimate gadget, i mean most people buy iPads just because they are iPads. That&#8217;s what may let down the Surface, it needs to be a thing. The pricing is not the best but iit is very very reasonable. Windows 8 RT rocks for a tablet</p>
<p>W8 will catch on. It will be in every new, or 90% of them released. The way to the phone is through the pc&#8230;muhahaha</p>
<p>I expect a 32GB and cellular Nexus 7 announcement, among other things.</p>
<p>This would have been fun if they &#8216;accidentally&#8217; timed it along Apple&#8217;s iPad mini event. Bullying the little guy in the mobile space is just too childish of Google.</p>
<p>Oh come on. Microsoft is a vast, bloated monster of a company. It made its founder the <em>richest man in the world</em>! Stop feeling sorry for them.</p>
<p>Its NEX-mas time!!!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get why all WP fans are always so crazy. The way I see it is the best one will win the limelight and if your so confident in MS (some are too confident tbh) then whatever Google does shouldn&#8217;t matter in the least.</p>
<p>For me personally it just makes things easier. I get to know what my next phone is in a quick amount if time</p>
<p>Well said.</p>
<p>With my One X&#8217;s JB update and all the tech news, the second half of October should be very interesting.</p>
<p>Boy have I been looking forward to this message! I can&#8217;t wait to see what the next Nexus device(s) will bring! It&#8217;s time to toss out my iPhone and get a new kick ass android phone in stead :D</p>
<p>I want HTC Nexus based on WHITE OneX dammit!</p>
<p>Business is business.They know that people are more interested in Android related news rather than windows phone 8 related news. We already know what the new Lumias will look like so I can assume that the excitement is not there anymore. On the other hand, we still don&#8217;t know if Google will release 4.2, multiple Nexus, or a new Hardware. And Google knows how to make a show (remember Google IO)</p>
<p>promising to &#8220;not do evil&#8221; does not equal promising to not compete.  if Google is in a position to steal Microsoft&#8217;s thunder on the 29th, then they would be stupid not to.  Microsoft may not have been much of a threat in the mobile space until now, but they certainly will be soon.  if i&#8217;m Google, i do everything i can to mute out Microsoft&#8217;s launches.</p>
<p>my hopes for the day are&#8230;<br />
1.  immediate spec bump to Galaxy Nexus while maintaining $350 off contract price.  hoping that&#8217;s what the GT-i9260 is all about.  if so, i&#8217;d buy that day.<br />
2.  announcement of new Nexus devices coming soon.  we know what&#8217;s coming.  announce them before every last part is leaked&#8230; please.<br />
3.  immediate price reduction of Nexus Q.  take a loss on it to gain some market share.  for everyone&#8217;s sake.</p>
<blockquote>3. immediate price reduction of Nexus Q. take a loss on it to gain some market share. for everyone’s sake.</blockquote>
<p>You would need to outsource manufacturing to China for that.</p>
<p>GT-i9260 is the Samsung Galaxy Premier not a Nexus.</p>
<p>so, 32 gb version of the event will come later?</p>
<p>This is going to be gooood.</p>
<p>My hopes for Oct. 29th:</p>
<p>1. The LG Nexus &#8211; a phone we&#8217;ve seen thoroughly over the past few weeks&#8230; from photos taken by the phone (confirmed through reported EXIF) to full on reviews of prototypes. Will Google/LG have anything that will surprise us about the phone? I sure hope so.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.gizmodo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lg-nexus-4-name.jpg" /></p>

<p>2. Google Now &#8211; I&#8217;m fairly certain Google Now will now allow you to turn off wi-fi, bluetooth, etc. Maybe add college sports? Not really sure what else they can add, but surprise us Google!</p>

<p><img src="http://oi45.tinypic.com/2e64uue.jpg" height="640" width="360" /></p>

<p>3. Android 4.2 &#8211; By far the most important thing. Will Google add some key features to their already amazing OS? Maybe unify G+ Messenger &amp; Google Talk? And then integrate that into SMS/Google Voice. Also making our OS even more buttery smooth would be awesome.</p>
<p>4. Nexus 7 &#8211; Almost certain that the 32gb Nexus 7 will be revealed. Kinda hoping/wishing the current 8gb gets dropped down to $99&#8230; :P</p>
<p>5. HTC Nexus &#8211; This is more of a wish but&#8230; I really hope Google stuns everyone by revealing a Nexus device based off of HTC&#8217;s J Butterfly. The same 5-inch screen with On-Screen buttons?! Beautiful.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.htc.com/managed-assets/jp/smartphones/htc-j-butterfly-htl21/marquee/HTC-J-Butterfly-HTL21-3V-white.png" /></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s do this.</p>
<blockquote>4. Nexus 7 – Almost certain that the 32gb Nexus 7 will be revealed. Kinda hoping/wishing the current 8gb gets dropped down to $99… :P</blockquote>
<p>If Google has inventory it needs to get rid of before the launch of the 32GB version, that might not be such a crazy hope/wish.</p>
<p>Telia here in Sweden removed the Samsung G Nexus from it&#8217;s lineup yesterday/today. Guess they&#8217;ll be adding the new one in the up coming weeks. I&#8217;m officially excited, pretty certain I&#8217;ll be buying the new Nexus.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be really amazing if they dropped the price for the 8GB Nexus 7 to 99$. It&#8217;d be a great move &#8211; &#8220;we are loosing money on these devices, but we want to make them available to a lot more people in order to motivate developers to create more great tablet apps for our platform&#8221;. They finally got the software right, they finally got the hardware, now get your ecosystem right. &#8220;The playground is open&#8221; even suggests the event will be about Google Play.</p>
<p>I can see $179 or $159 even&#8230;but not $99.</p>
<p>Unless they have something to wow the world, WP8 is getting all the attention</p>
<p>WP8, which has already been extensively previewed and for which the major hardware has already been shown, is going to &#8220;wow the world&#8221; how exactly?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all hardware, not software or apps. Microsoft isn&#8217;t letting anyone close to them or partnered with them to touch a Windows Phone 8 phone.  Something big could be in the works.</p>
<p>No, there have been software previews too. Sure, the weird silence <em>could</em> mean there&#8217;s something big in the works. But epiq.one seems to feel WP8 is guaranteed to get all the publicity even if there isn&#8217;t. That seems&#8230; dumb.</p>
<p>No. On launch day journo&#8217;s will seemingly only then give full reviews. Meaning the Internet is going to be full of WP8 coverage &#8211; unless Google has a trump card.</p>
<p>No one has come out with a full software preview. Repeat: FULL software preview. If the user experience is what Microsoft is promising then a lot of influential people will call the 8X / L920 / AtivS the best phone they&#8217;ve used &#8211; and this will come as big news considering the iPhone 5 is already circulating.</p>
<p>Remember: Google is holding an event which is likely an announcement of some sort. Microsoft is releasing actual hardware to the public.</p>
<p>Who says that Google won&#8217;t be releasing new hardware to the public as well?</p>
<p>Retailers.<br />
They might announce new hardware but its not on sale on the 29th of October. Not even Apple can announce and start shipping/retailing on Day 1 / Day 0</p>
<p>Exciting month!</p>
<p>What would really rock my world would be an Android 4.2 or 5.0 that can compete with Windows RT on tablets and scaling to larger screens!  I&#8217;ve played around with docking my Galaxy Nexus to my 27&quot; monitor and external keyboard and mouse at home, and it&#8217;s alright, but the experience leaves a bit to be desired.  Windows RT or Ubuntu on Android would scratch that itch, but I&#8217;d really like to see Google tackle the dockable OS problem head-on.</p>
<p>I hope this isn&#8217;t Key Lime Pie as my HTC One X is only just now getting Jelly Bean this month.</p>
<p>Yes, let&#8217;s delay updates to the Android OS because your manufacturers and carriers refuse to update your devices in a timely fashion. Next time, go Nexus.</p>
<p>umad bro?</p>
<p>The Verge really needs collapsible comments!</p>
<p>The invite makes reference to Google Now and says &#8220;The playground is now open&#8221;, which makes me think: what if  Google is opening up the development of Google Now cards to others? Like Apple let other developers create widgets.</p>
<p>Google Now is good. Put the right APIs in place to let others make use of the core features Voice Search and let them go crazy and create more useful cards while Apple keeps adding features to Siri at corporate pace.</p>
<p>Wow three events from the three Juggernauts within a week of each other.  Here are my predictions.</p>
<p>Apple will of course release an iPad Mini..and&#8230;well their other stuff, but the iPad Mini will be the highlight.  I also think they will release the New iPad with the new dock connector.  As we have seen in the rumor mill the pricing will be 249, 349, 449&#8230;.8GB, 16GB, 32GB respectively.  There will be oos and ahhs and the usual Apple related post event news.  Then the barrage of &#8220;Apple Has Just Killed all other tablets&#8221; commentage will start.  It will be shortly lived.</p>
<p>Then the Windows 8 event&#8230;&#8230;.well&#8230;&#8230;not many people will pay attention to it.  However it will be some nice hardware, I&#8217;m almost positive&#8230;but this is almost a little too late for Microsoft, and the Apple will dominate tablets commentage continues&#8230;for like an hour.</p>
<p>Then the Google event.  If you noticed Google likes having last word on all these events.  I expect a crap load of mobile devices.  I expect them to announce APIs to developers for Google Now, announce at least 2 new Nexus Phones&#8230;probably 4.  Announce the Nexus 7 32GB model at the 249.99 Price Point, and Announce a Samsung Nexus 10 Tablet at a 299.99 and 349.99 Price Point.  So that 4 Nexus Phones (LG, Samsung, Sony, and HTC) and 2 Nexus Tablets (Nexus 7 by ASUS and Nexus 10 by Samsung).  Now what might be a nice surprise is revamped software on the Nexus Q with a pricepoint of 149.99.</p>
<p>So best case scenario Google will announce like 7 devices, worst case scenario is about 3.  Anyway it goes the Apple IPad mini will start looking very dull and that tablet domination commentage will basically stop.</p>
<p>Stop playing with my emotions man! I have no money!</p>
<p>Hope there is some news on google play gift cards coming to United Kingdom</p>
<p>Anyone thinks that the tagline &#8217; the playground is open&#8217;  May as well refer to the fact that Google might start to really tackle gaming on android? By that I mean provide a more integrated gaming experience, a bit like Game centre for iOS. I personally hate having to sign up for a different account every time I installed a multiplayer game.  I surely hope that there are updates to the odd other that Google now, even though I don&#8217;t expect a great deal since Jelly Bean is still nascent.</p>
<p>I know about him here in australia. His first company went to google for millions! It was a very big deal and I think that the university even got a sizable return from the sale!</p>
<p>His face is plastered on University of New South Wales PhD program billboards everywhere here in Sydney. GO STRAYA!</p>
<p>Sounds like Local Scout/Google Places to me; probably with a bit of Foursquare and Foodspotting rolled in.</p>
<p>His new project sounds exciting because there isn&#8217;t one go to thing right now.. for me personally. I just wish it won&#8217;t be &#8220;only american&#8221; like most comparable services existing now. Could it be that hard to open this concept to Europe, (all of it not just Germany and the UK) and make it work?</p>
<p>I would think the issue with doing that would be its  a smaller market and probably different laws spanning across boards could be an issue. Only guessing but i can see that being a potential issue for start up companies. You want to hit a large market and in the US you can do that.</p>
<p>Good article, was unaware of his work.</p>
<p>Thanks Mike.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s about the money.</p>
<p>Well he&#8217; s probably already a multimillionaire at this point , so it might not be.</p>
<p>proud to be Israeli</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>Proud I adopted a dog.</p>
<p>lol&#8230; LOL&#8230; wrong time to say that isnt it&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested to see what his newest project will be, also, this is a written article.</p>
<p>Correction:<br />

<p>Isn&#8217;t there already an &#8220;Urban Compass&#8221; app in the App Store?  <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1150892/urbancompass.html" target="_blank">http://www.macworld.com/article/1150892/urbancompass.html</a></p>
<p>Smart guy &#8211; but his team isn&#8217;t that inspiring in terms of a more public/consumer internet startup &#8211; lots of engineers with tech backgrounds &#8211; not much on the UX side.  Maybe their data will be that compelling &#8211; we&#8217;ll see &#8211; but having a CEO  and COO that were previously at Goldman doesn&#8217;t seem like a start-up with a lot of credibility.  All smart guys &#8211; but again, almost zero consumer experience.</p>
<p>What if they&#8217;re outsourcing the design work! This is just a fresh new startup! His last startup that got sold to Twitter had amazing designers!</p>
<p>Bill Nguyen</p>
<p>Why is he even working? He should be getting paid just for being so handsome.</p>
<p>That is not a small number!</p>
<p>That is a big number!</p>
<p>Yo Apple. No need for a 7&quot; tablet, Google&#8217;s got this. ;)</p>
<p>I think Josh just justified my purchase. Thanks a bunch.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LjFmr.gif" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for more tablet centric content. I&#8217;ll pass for now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still not better than an iPad in terms of it&#8217;s battery life, screen, wealth of content &amp; apps made for it&#8217;s size. The iPad still reigns supreme in that division &amp; if Apple comes out with a 7&quot; version of the iPad 2/3, I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;d still be a better buy than the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>haters are always going to hate&#8230;..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not hating, it&#8217;s just not that amazing. It&#8217;s big Galaxy Nexus with updated software. A cool device but it&#8217;s just not better than the iPad.</p>
<p>The iPad is 2½ times as expensive. It really does sound like you are hating.</p>
<p>Quality costs money dude.</p>
<p>Sure but not everyone wants quality for a higher price. Apple themselves have dipped into this before and I expect them to do it again. The second any 7&quot; tablet has real market success they will be right there either with a 7&quot; iPad or, more likely IMO, something more like a 5-6&quot; iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Exactly. Also, between an 8GB iPod touch for $199 and This awesome Nexus 7, the N7 is the better buy, no matter what you say.</p>
<p>Quality costs money, yes but it doesn&#8217;t cost as much as Apple used to forward to customers in the cost. Think. They were able to become the richest company in the U.S from their product sales. It&#8217;s no secret that Apple sells at an astronomical markup. Everything they&#8217;ve ever sold they make a giant profit on. Why? Because they&#8217;ve tricked certain people into thinking they are the best items on earth and if you own one, you&#8217;re cool/smarter/better than others. As human beings, many of us secretly want to feel that way. Apple has remarkably played this up so potently as to trick their fans into paying the highest premium for their devices. That is an impressive feat.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it obvious that they are selling a perception more so than quality if they&#8217;re able to make those kinds of profits?<br />
What you&#8217;re likely getting is a device with similar guts as the competition, save for a metal casing and the fallacy that it&#8217;s of better quality than the competition. But you refuse to believe that, and so the fanboy emotions get all heated.</p>
<p>Of course folks will have to justify buying iDevices until they bleed; if you buy 1 of 2 items for more money and they are in reality, equal to each other in design and makeup then you&#8217;d be labeled a sucker. No one wants to be a sucker, especially if they believe they are better than someone else. God forbid.</p>
<p>To each his own I say. I like to see the quality and function in all tech. The Nexus 7 is impressive for the price, and if Apple can release a 7 iPad with similar specs for a similar price then that will only be better for us all as consumers.</p>
<p>I just want to point out that having a bunch of money sitting in a bank account does not make you &#8220;the richest company in America&#8221;. It just means you have the most cash.</p>
<p>The iPad is 2 ½ times expensive because Apple chooses to have incredible profit margins. Google is making that sacrifice. The iPad could be a $300, maybe $250 device if Apple didn&#8217;t care about it&#8217;s margins, what would be the end result then? Or is the screen size still a big enough difference to not warrant a comparison. I&#8217;m not hating, I&#8217;m stating my opinion.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s $500. Your argument of &#8220;could be&#8221; doesn&#8217;t matter. The iPad is $500, this is $200. This is a fantastic bang for its buck.</p>
<p>Yes it&#8217;s a great bang for it&#8217;s buck, that isn&#8217;t my argument. My argument is that it is still not better than an iPad, which is truly isn&#8217;t, in it&#8217;s whole.</p>
<p>My argument is that it is, on the whole, for its price.</p>
<p>I believe, even at it&#8217;s price the iPad 2 would still be a more worthwhile &amp; full featured device to but at $400.</p>
<p>buy*</p>
<p>The problem with there is, the iPad 2 only support iOS 6 lite. You don&#8217;t get all of the OS features like the iPad 3.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s still twice as expensive, with a lower resolution display thant the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>iOS 6 &#8220;lite&#8221; as you like to call it doesn&#8217;t take away from the hundreds of thousands of useful creation &amp; media consumption apps available. On top of what Apple already provides. The screen is another issue. But even with the inferior screen you still get an overall better &amp; more useful device.</p>
<p>Wow you really are trolling a review about the Google Nexus 7 pretty hard. I always feel like someone has done something incredibly right when someone like you has to come out of the woodworks and defend your precious iPad so hard when it&#8217;s nearly irrelevant to this article.</p>
<p>Then let&#8217;s hope for Google&#8217;s sake that your feeling is totally off since no device in competition with the iPad has been very successful at all.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t they have a 10&quot; one? What&#8217;s the deal with Android phones being huge and their tablets being small?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.slashgear.com/google-nexus-10-reportedly-in-pipeline-29236412/" target="_blank">http://www.slashgear.com/google-nexus-10-reportedly-in-pipeline-29236412/</a></p>
<p>The reason is simple, the biggest cost of the tablet is the screen.  No Android vendor can match the cost and the quality of large retina display.  So Google is going to the cheap and inferior small display route!  People ought to know why 40&quot; HDTV costs more than 20&quot; TV.</p>
<p>Of course they can.   It&#8217;s not like Apple makes the display themselves, Samsung does.  And Samsung is also an Android vendor.</p>

<p>Because 10&quot; tablets make no sense.  You can&#8217;t fit them in any pocket or purse, and if I&#8217;m going to carry something extra around with me, it&#8217;s going to be an air or ultrabook because they are WAY more versatile.</p>
<p>You can fit the 7&quot; in your pocket? That&#8217;s nuts.</p>
<p>yes.w</p>
<p>&#8220;You can fit the 7&#8221; in your pocket? That’s nuts.&quot;<br />
Yep, it fits nicely in my back jeans pocket or a coat pocket.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t know how people fit a note into their pockets.</p>
<blockquote>Because 10&quot; tablets make no sense</blockquote>
<p>You are seriously arguing that 10&quot; tablets make no sense? After the success of iPad?</p>
<p>Look the Nexus 7 is a <em>great</em> tablet, and the 7&quot; form factor is very nice. But don&#8217;t say stupid things like &#8220;10&#8221; tablets make no sense.&quot; That is just plain false.</p>
<p>Just because something sells well doesn&#8217;t mean people continue to find the device ideal after purchase.  Especially when something is marketed as hard as the iPad in a market that changes as quickly as technology.</p>
<p>You think everyone that bought a snuggy still uses it and finds it to be better than a microplush blanket that can be had for a few bucks less?</p>
<p>10&quot; tablets did make sense when the iPad first came to market because they were much more portable and had much better battery life than any laptop.</p>
<p>However, in today&#8217;s market you can get a thin laptop in the same price range that competes on battery life but gives you extra versatility.  (and everyone that I know that had 10+&quot; tablets now find themselves migrating back toward macbooks and ultrabooks.)</p>
<p>So why buy a 10&quot;+ tablet in today&#8217;s market?</p>
<blockquote>10&quot; tablets did make sense when the iPad first came to market because they were much more portable and had much better battery life than any laptop.</blockquote>
<p>I think you completely miss the point. A 10&quot; tablet may not make sense to you, but they make perfect sense in the current market: <em>they are still selling extremely well — as in, right now. They are orders of magnitude more popular than any other tablet.</em>.</p>
<p>When they stop selling well (we&#8217;ll see when that happens), it&#8217;s fine to say they don&#8217;t make sense. But currently they make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I sold my iPad for $275 (considering Apple is selling them for $299, that&#8217;s pretty good.) because it was just too big. At 225.77 (after shipping and taxes), I bought the Nexus 7 8GB. For me, 7&quot; will be perfect. It&#8217;s small enough to truly be portable, but big enough that I can see with squinting.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because phone apps don&#8217;t look good on a 10&quot; screen. But on a 7&quot; they are passable.</p>
<p>Being huge is being different from the tiny iPhone, being small is being different from the big iPad.</p>
<p>Toshiba has an Android tablet bigger than any iOS device.</p>
<p>They probably feel a Chromebook would be the better choice for bigger sized devices?</p>
<p>Android apps market growing quickly with buit-in google products and services. I thought it&#8217;s not the issue anymore?? The new jelly bean has offline GPS and better voice search quality than Siri as I read the review.  199$ is a real deal. I&#8217;ll buy 2 for my family intead of the ipad2 anytime</p>
<p>The problem is the severe lack of tablet apps.</p>
<p>atleast normal apps can adapt to the screen instead of having to be magnified</p>
<p>Every time I hear someone say, &#8220;severe lack of tablet apps,&#8221; I get confused &#8212; do regular non-tablet apps not work on tablets? Just because they aren&#8217;t <em>optimized </em>for tablets, doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t work at all. There&#8217;s a big difference between core functionality and extras &#8212; as far as I can tell, Google Maps works the same on a phone, just that the detail window is a separate  fragment in the tablet-optimized version. I don&#8217;t get why Josh and so many others have to complain, as if when you buy a tablet, you literally only have 100 apps to choose from.</p>
<p>Help me out here, tablet-app-shortage people, what am I missing? Obviously it would be <em>nice </em>to have every app optimized for tablets, but what keeps you from using &#8220;phone apps&#8221; on a tablet?</p>
<p>Not true at all. My Transformer Prime was filled with mostly tablet apps.</p>
<p>Not as many as ios doesn&#8217;t automatically mean severe lack.</p>
<p>That is a ridiculous &#8220;problem&#8221; without specifics.  The iPad 2 is getting 99% of iOS 6.  If you can explain which lacking features make an iPad 2 with iOS 6 a poor device, you might have an actual argument.  Is there even anything other than Siri the iPad 2 won&#8217;t get with iOS 6?</p>
<p>Siri gets 99% of Apples advertising time on the telly&#8230; So, is it really insignificant? Facetime for 3g is also disabled for some unexplainable reason.</p>
<p>And the lower resolution at twice the cost is a ridiculous claim? How about last gen internals then? :)</p>
<p>But the iPad 2 already didn&#8217;t have Siri.  So I guess since people have used it with iOS 5 &#8220;Light&#8221; they won&#8217;t exactly think iOS 6 is any &#8220;lighter&#8221;? :)</p>
<p>I bet the last generation internals can keep up with this tablet in just about anything and will power software that just won&#8217;t be available for this tablet for quite a while.</p>
<blockquote>But the iPad 2 already didn’t have Siri. So I guess since people have used it with iOS 5 "Light" they won’t exactly think iOS 6 is any "lighter"? :)<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>We are talking about <i>new&lt;/&gt; devices here. People might not quite understand why one iPad gets Siri, but not the new one they bought, just because it was cheaper.</i></p>
<p>The last sentence is , to be fair, pure guessing/wishing from your part.</p></blockquote>
<p>I ¤&amp;&quot;#&amp;%# hate this lack of edit. :)</p>
<p>Let me help you then:</p>
<p>I fucking hate this lack of edit. :)</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>I think people are pretty prepared to understand that buying a cheap device in a given product line has fewer features than the more expensive one :)</p>
<blockquote>I think people are pretty prepared to understand that buying a cheap device in a given product line has fewer features than the more expensive one :)</blockquote>
<p>Not when in every other computing ecosystem where those features are a result of software.</p>
<p>When it is software, you expect to be able to upgrade to the better features down the line.  There is no reason the iPad 2 can&#8217;t run Siri or Facetime 3G.  The buyers should in fact be able to purchase those apps.  In every other computing environment this is considered normal.</p>
<p>Apple is continuing their alienation of value conscious buyers by crippling their own products.  I had hoped that Mr. Cook would get rid of that attitude at Apple following Jobs&#8217; death.  Unfortunately this has not been the case.  Growing up in the 80&#8217;s I saw that attitude which permanently turned me off from Apple back then.  It is actually a bit of a surprise to me that Apple&#8217;s company character has not improved, especially given their success.</p>
<p>The main difference will be that the iPad 2 as a crazy abundance of tablet apps, and the Nexus 7 doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The iPad 2 gets almost every iOS 6 feature, including Flyover.</p>
<p>Too bad it&#8217;s still twice the price of the Nexus 7, which has a higher resolution and better chipset.</p>
<p>Your logic so far are good, but for general people.  BUT. Google OS is still better for me when I want to do more than just consuming content.  I say this as a owner of an iPad 3 and a Galaxy Nexus.</p>
<p>Like Garageband or a full office suite, of which Google tablets have neither?</p>
<p>99% of ppl are fine with what Google docs provides.  Garageband? Niche at best</p>
<p>99% is a number you pulled out of your ass&#8230;</p>
<p>Much like what digitalbobby pulled out of his ass about not having a full office suite?</p>
<p>Heh, so it&#8217;s justified to lie when it suits your opinion eh? Regardless, he&#8217;s right, 99% is just pulled out of his ass. You&#8217;re right too, but the fact you attacked the one person that made a true statement shows you likely care more about your liar&#8217;s opinion than the truth.</p>
<p>So he provides an example of content creation, and you dismiss it because he&#8217;s right? Cool.</p>

<p>What were you saying again? Do we need to bring up that Google Docs now has offline editing enabled?</p>
<p>Those are all clunky. In fact, Polaris is probably the best, and it has nothing on Pages and co.</p>
<p>You have got to be joking. Polaris Office is a full MS Office compatible suite. Pages is just a pretty looking version of a rather primitive text editor like Wordpad.</p>
<p>Polaris office is lightyears ahead of Pages. It&#8217;s not even in the same league</p>
<p>Lol&#8230; have you even used the office equivalents on iOS?  They&#8217;re clunky, feature lacking,  pieces of crap.</p>

<p>Probably the best office app on Android.,</p>
<p>Since when does the iPad have full office suite? I assume you mean MS Office?</p>
<p>well&#8230; you can purchase the iWork apps (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) on the App Store.</p>
<p>Me and a lot of people I know who owns an iPad, didn&#8217;t get the Garageband and full office suite from Apple. I use my laptop for Office. iPad ain&#8217;t really designed for that. Maybe the Surface is. But not the iPad.</p>
<p>please shut up.</p>
<p>Perhaps. But it&#8217;s harder for me to share the iPad with my wife than to buy 2 of these and not have to worry about that.</p>
<p>At least you won&#8217;t have to worry about buying apps for either device, too, because there are none! ;)</p>
<p>Wrong. There are 600K apps in the the Play Store, and most of them would run in Nexus 7 just fine. Maybe most are not tablet optimized, but it will run. And it won&#8217;t look like the iPhone Apps in the middle of your iPad screen. You just don&#8217;t have any idea.</p>
<p>I have close to 100 apps on my iPad and there&#8217;s only one app that doesn&#8217;t have an iPad version: Speedtest.net. Running it on iPad gives me an app with tiny black borders around the edges. It&#8217;s annoying, but no big deal for the few instances I need to use it.</p>
<p>The point is that there&#8217;s almost no apps that AREN&#8217;T tablet optimized for iPad. On Android, it&#8217;s the opposite.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s got Chrome, the best browser out there (citation needed)!</p>
<p>Not trying to get into the middle of the circle-jerk, but so does iOS now.</p>
<p>We now return you to your regularly scheduled platform flame-war&#8230;.</p>
<p>How many times can the same comment be said by the same person in the same thread? Thank you, Shenmue.  Reading it this time made it perfectly clear, finally.</p>
<p>What&#8217;cha hiding from your wife? ;)</p>
<p>You should buy an iPad and then place it on your altar.</p>
<p>The $400 iPad2 has half the RAM, less than half the CPU speed and a lower display resolution for twice the price.<br />
Unless you are an Apple fanboy, it isn&#8217;t worth it at all.</p>
<p>iOS is less resource intensive than Android. That means it needs less battery-draining RAM and CPU to eke out the same performance. And it has perhaps a hundred times as many tablet optimized apps as Android. I&#8217;m not trolling, but to say the iPad 2 isn&#8217;t worth its price is silly. It&#8217;s the cheapest way to get access to the iOS tablet ecosystem.</p>
<p>When $400 is the cheapest way to an ecosystem, you know you&#8217;re in the wrong ecosystem.</p>
<p>Tuan X: If you want to spend $400 for a slow tablet go ahead.  If you want something fast and will respond when you touch it. I will buy this tablet at half the price.</p>
<p>How would a tablet that is twice as much with a lower resolution screen and a slower processor/gpu be a better device to buy? I fail to understand your logic. If you just want a tablet for web browsing, media consumption, and reading (which are the main reasons an average consumer buys a tablet), then why would saving $200 dollars and getting a more feature-rich tablet be a bad idea? Please enlighten us.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t you heard? There are millions of tablet apps on the App store and only one on the Play Store. Obviously it is impossible to develop tablet apps for Android, it has nothing to do with the fact that the worst offenders have hundreds of terrible programmers and designers.</p>
<p>Shut up dude. I own an iPhone and a MBP but I&#8217;d be the first to admit that you&#8217;re a fucking troll.</p>
<p>Price is independent of it&#8217;s usefulness.</p>
<p>nobody argues on that. but, still, in this world, money matter. I am a apple &#8220;guy&#8221; with MBpro and iPhone, but I (I mean, &#8220;I&#8221;, not &#8220;everyone&#8221;) have no use for a $500 tablet, as I would use it only for browsing / mail and as reader, so the app portfolio is no issue for me. The nature of my work forces me to stick with a &#8220;PC era&#8221; device. but I can see the benefits of a much more portable 7&#8217; cheap tablet with very solid specs.</p>
<p>so it is individual, for me. a &#8220;worse&#8221; $200 device is actually better than the &#8220;better&#8221; iPad, because I simply have no use for it (tried it).</p>
<p>there is no overall &#8220;winner&#8221; and price does matter a lot, especially with such comparable specs.</p>
<p>Great, and a Honda Accord isnt better than a BMW 535i. Doesnt mean that the honda is probably a very smart decision for a lot of buyers</p>
<p>Except in this case of your poor attempt at an analogy the Honda is faster, has a nicer engine/interior and drives better. The only thing is you can&#8217;t brag to your friends about your Ipad&#8230; I mean your BMW.</p>
<p>@Tuan X &#8212; Firstly, it&#8217;s pretty hard to base your arguments on hypotheticals.  Secondly, It&#8217;s a bit ridiculous to compare a $500 tablet to a $200 tablet.  It&#8217;s like comparing a Kia to a Lexus, BMW, etc. and saying &#8220;The Lexus has more options, a better interior, etc. than the Kia.&#8221;  DUH! It costs 2.5x more, and when something costs more, people typically expect more as well.  Very weak argument my friend&#8230;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about the ecosystem, however, which is far more fleshed out on iOS.  Not hardware features, software.  And you&#8217;re totally missing that.</p>
<p>Comparisons between this and the iPad are inevitable, but in all honesty that&#8217;s not really fair.</p>
<p>They have completely different form factors and are in completely different price brackets.</p>
<p>As for the whole tablet app vs phone app thing, I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s so big of a deal either. This tablet is not that much bigger than any of the android phones, I&#8217;m sure flipboard looks great on it, netflix looks great on it, chrome looks great on it, gmail looks great. I don&#8217;t know about you but that&#8217;s really what I want a tablet for. I have a laptop if I need anything more.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not competing with the iPad. Yes it&#8217;s an Android tablet, but it&#8217;s competing with the Kindle Fire, hence the low amount of storage and emphasis on getting/streaming everything from Google Play/Cloud; just as the Kindle Fire does with Instant Video and eBooks and the like.</p>
<p>&#8220;IN IT&#8217;S WHOLE.&#8221; is what you said. price would be considered in this. gNex 7 wins, handily.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to argue with your opinion over whether it&#8217;s better or not&#8230;but to say it wins handily shows some heavy bias.</p>
<p>the iPad is just better in terms of Screen resolution, Apps and maybe a better build quality. Definitely not the OS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an iPad user only because of the Apps. But there are a lot of things that my Nexus S is better.</p>
<p>simple examples: <br />
1. When I want to share a URL, other than to Twitter&#8230;how would I do that in iOS? How much easier is it to do in Android? You probably don&#8217;t know don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;m in the photo gallery app of my device and finds a photo that I would like to edit in a third party app or share to Instagram, how would I do that in iOS? How easy would it be to do in Android? You also probably don&#8217;t have an idea don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>1. Copy the URL. iOS6 does FB integration.<br />
2. Open the editing app, and wow! Look at all of your photos right there, ready for editing!</p>
<p>iOS 6 won&#8217;t even be available till October if last year is any indication.</p>
<p>1. No. In iOS &#8212; From the browser, it&#8217;s copy the URL. Home button or &#8220;switch App gesture&#8221;. Open the other App. Paste the URL. Then Share. Home again or &#8220;switch App gesture&#8221;. Back to browser and continue reading.</p>
<p>In Android &#8212; From the browser, hit share, select which app you want to share it, done. You&#8217;re still in the browser, continue reading.</p>
<p>Also, in Android FB integration and other Apps  integration have been there since forever. So iOS6 what&#8217;s to get too excited about that.</p>
<p>2. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re in editing app already, not from the photo gallery app when you suddenly find a photo that you&#8217;d want to share. <br />
Well, in Android &#8212; it&#8217;s just as easy as Number 1.</p>
<p>As a whole, regardless of price, the iPad would be a better  device. But that&#8217;s not a valid argument b/c ultimately price is a huge factor in consumer choice. So comparing a $500 device against a $200 one isn&#8217;t a very effective argument.</p>
<p>For people with a ton of money, they can buy an iPad. Or hell, pick up both. For the rest of us, there&#8217;s now a valid offering in the $200 price range in the form of the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>and a Ferrari is better than a Civic.</p>
<p>But in this case the Civic is faster than the Ferrari, has a nicer engine/interior and drives better. You just can&#8217;t brag to your friends about your Ipad&#8230; I mean Ferrari.</p>
<p>That is entirely dependent on what you plan to use it for, is it not?<br />
For $200 if you get the same functionality that you as a user would get from an iPad, at a much reduced price, then for an individual it can be better than an iPad.</p>
<p>iPad 3 starts at $399.</p>
<p>On what planet?</p>
<p>hmm. I goofed.</p>
<p>what&#8217;s an iPad 3?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no such thing.</p>
<p>Is so.  I just bought mine a couple months ago.  Sweet screen, too ;-)</p>
<p>technically no. According to apple it is &#8220;The iPad.&#8221; or New iPad. NOT iPad 3.</p>
<p><img src="http://i306.photobucket.com/albums/nn266/nhatural/ipad.png" /></p>
<p>Thanks. Dunno what I was smoking.</p>
<p>iPad 2 is for sale at $399.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s where I tripped up.</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/173/576/Wat8.jpg?1315930535" /></p>
<p>but he has a point, if people are comparing &#8216;specs&#8217; then spec for spec iPad would seem to be better consider google in selling this at a 0% profit margin.</p>
<p>That is a LUDICROUS argument. Apple is a hardware company, first and foremost. In terms of revenue, the hardware makes up almost their entire revenue pie. Google is a SERVICES company. Google&#8217;s not really that vested in hardware. Google can basically care less about making money off the hardware. Why? Because it&#8217;s not their core business. Their core business is to track users and making a TON of money from that tracked user data. Google&#8217;s point with the Nexus 7 is to gain a larger user base, pure and simple., The larger their user base, the larger their revenue stream from selling user tracking data.</p>
<p>Basically two completely different types of businesses. Do you think Google doesn&#8217;t care about ridiculous margins? Google cares DEARLY about ridiculously high margins except for Google, the margin is in the business of selling the data they get from tracking the user. It&#8217;s just like Microsoft, Microsoft could care less about making money from hardware. Heck, the whole point of Surface for Microsoft is to bring out a great product to support their upcoming Windows 8 in which competitors will finally have to compete with a QUALITY piece of hardware rather than sitting on their toosh churning out generic and badly designed pieces of hardware over and over again just because it&#8217;s easy and comfortable.</p>
<p>Fantastic. Completely agree, People need to think about business strategy. Additionally, Google is entering the tablet market late, and being a loss leader much wiser than using a premium pricing strategy right now.</p>
<p>Late? The market has only just opened. Apple might be on their 3rd gen device, but no one had released a serious competitor to the iPad till 18 months ago. Apple were early, they ignited the market for these devices!</p>
<p>The tablet market is barely born!</p>
<p>&#8220;Google can basically care less about making money off the hardware.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, so they are able to care less, which means they do care. Got it.</p>
<p>That read just as Stewie would say it.</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />
Using &#8220;Could care less&#8221; and &#8220;never fails to disappoint&#8221; are instant indicators of some serious fails in logical thinking.</p>
<p>It tends to be an international difference. We Brits tend to use &#8220;couldn&#8217;t care less&#8221;  whereas in the states I see a lot more people writing &#8220;could care less&#8221;, intending to mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Oh certainly. They might intend to communicate the same thing, but they&#8217;re actually communicating the exact opposite, which is why its a a logical fail in misunderstanding both syntax AND irony.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because Americans are idiots that don&#8217;t understand grammar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, smart Americans don&#8217;t say dumb things like &#8220;could care less&#8221; because they understand the implication of the combination of words instead of just thinking it&#8217;s an idiom that makes no sense other than that everyone else gets you.</p>
<p>Google is not a SERVICES company, Google is an ADVERTISING company.</p>
<p>well, advertising is a service.</p>
<p>by that logic Apple is a phone company</p>
<p>No, they are a computer hardware company. You know, you are what you earn money from.</p>
<p>yes most of their revenue is from iPhone/iPad</p>
<p>Indeed.  The Nexus line is not intended to suceed in terms of making money of hardware. It&#8217;s intended as a look guys, this is what a good peice of android hardware is. Now please make ones similar or better and sell our services for us. And if you don&#8217;t, people will buy ours.</p>
<blockquote> the margin is in the business of selling the data they get from tracking the user.</blockquote>
<p>For the umpteenth time, they do NOT sell your data to advertisers.</p>
<p>But overall, good comment.</p>
<p>They do, just not packaged directly.</p>
<p>No, they don&#8217;t. They don&#8217;t sell personal data. What they sell is analytic data (i.e. &#8220;people of age X who live in city Y might be interested in product Z&#8221;). They sell statistics, which are based on personal data, but not the personal data itself.</p>
<p>lol, &#8220;they sell personal data, but not the personal data itself&#8221;</p>
<p>Makes a lot of sense&#8230;.</p>
<p>They sell personal data, whether it&#8217;s the statistics they&#8217;ve gained by using the personal data gathered or not, it&#8217;s still the sale of personal data.</p>
<p>I agree that the Nexus 7 is certainly no iPad. But for someone who&#8217;s willing to try something that&#8217;s not iOS (Yes, some people don&#8217;t like iPads) and can&#8217;t afford a $400-$500 price tag, the Nexus 7 is a great choice and probably the best non iOS tablet around. <br />
It was not meant to compete against the iPad. but the Kindle Fire. Although if Google comes out with a 10 inch tablet that runs as smooth as this one and with a lot more content and apps designed for it, I would argue that it could easily match the iPad.</p>
<p>Hell, even for people who want to use iOS, if they can&#8217;t afford the iPad, then the Nexus is a better deal. Until there&#8217;s an iPad that costs $200, people who can&#8217;t afford it will be drawn to less expensive options. Particularly when said less expensive option offers most of the features of the iPad anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making that sacrifice&#8221; = &#8220;knows the only way to sell this beyond those of us predisposed to it  is to undercut on price&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not sure if it is a matter of sacrifice. As a traded company, Google has to make a profit. I think Asus is making a profit on the device, while Google will make a profit on selling content. Asus did the best hardware they could for that price.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to sell at slim margins when you can save on R&amp;D costs by imitating your competitors&#8217; innovations.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re about equal in the bang for buck barometer.</p>
<p>Verge will compare Nexus 7 to other 10 inch tablets, but not the ipad. I think its just to keep you apple fan-boys happy, but the lack of a head to head speaks volumes.</p>
<p>The reason it&#8217;s cheap because Google isn&#8217;t paying for patents. Nokia will sue first and Apple will do the same.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not meant to compete with the ipad &#8211; so this entire argument is specious.</p>
<p>Always humorous because the iPad is a giant iPod touch, in reality.</p>
<p>And this is a slightly bigger Galaxy Nexus. What&#8217;s your point?</p>
<p>No. Not at all.</p>
<p>How not? It&#8217;s not even really a resolution bump! This is almost to the Galaxy Nexus as the first Galaxy Tab was to the Galaxy S phones&#8230; Well, no, those had far more in common. But it&#8217;s still more comparable than the iPad to iPod touch thing, which is overdone. Especially since the retina display bump on the iPad.</p>
<p>Other than size, how does the iPad differ from the iPod Touch?</p>
<p>There are several things I can do on my Galaxy Nexus that I won&#8217;t be able to do with the Nexus 7. Would you say that the iPad is just a larger iPhone?</p>
<p>No because the iPad runs hundreds of thousands of Apps that the iPhone doesn&#8217;t, that are built from the ground up to run on a 10&quot; screen. The Nexus 7 on the other hand runs standard Android phone apps.</p>
<p>Much as the iPad is a giant iPod touch, yes, this is a giant galaxy nexus.</p>
<p>No, it isn&#8217;t. And if you believe that than all android tablets are big android phones. Especially now with jelly bean</p>
<p>I own the iPad 3 and I must say it is literally a big iPod touch which isn&#8217;t a bad thing. It&#8217;s just ironic that Android is now getting crushed for having &#8220;just a bigger phone&#8221; OS on there. If the experience is great (like the iPad) why get bent over it?</p>
<p>Form factor wise, yes.<br />
However, functionality wise. No.<br />
The real estate alone on the screen is enough to differentiate it, and the apps that are develop to use that extra space are testament to that.</p>
<p>Try Spotify for iPod Touch/iPhone then try the iPad version and you can instantly see the benefits.</p>
<p>Try a music listening app to determine how beneficial tablet apps are vs phone apps?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Tuan X:<br />
This is not a Galaxy Nexus with new software.<br />
My Galaxy Nexus does not have a quad core Tegra3.<br />
My Galaxy Nexus screen definitely is not scratch resistant.<br />
Updated Software and an updated OS are different things, this has both.<br />
The OS updates coming directly from Google on this one (no carrier or OEM to delay things), means this will be getting a new OS every six months for at least 18 months.  My VZW LTE Galaxy Nexus won&#8217;t be updated nearly as quickly.</p>
<p>You are correct it is not an iPad. But, my new iPad (3rd gen) has its own set of issues.  The retina display is more pixels than the GPU can handle readily. Any creative app (Sketchbook Ink. etc) is extremely laggy when trying to use.</p>
<p>ON POINT!</p>
<p>actually, btw, Verizon GNex got Jelly Bean yesterday, and it is awesome =]</p>
<p>i think he means an OT update not XDA ;)</p>
<p>Actually, The Verizon Galaxy Nexus got a ROM rolled from a preview release  OTA&#8217;d to devices given away at Google IO. Then people worked to get LTE, and also WiFi issue resolved.</p>
<p>JB hasn&#8217;t been released to the public,  and the ROM you mentioned is far from official.  That being said, it is awesome in many directions. Fast, responsive, Google Now is surprisingly useful. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Consider me shocked if Verizon actually releases this to the Xoom, and to the LTE GNex anytime soon.</p>
<p>Google says they will have it ready to roll out by mid-July, who knows when Verizon will push it OTA.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see if the RAZR or RAZR Maxx get this before the GN.  Considering those both have plenty of proprietary and skinned changes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll never see JB on the RAZR, we&#8217;re lucky it&#8217;s getting ICS,  just ask Droid 3 owners.</p>
<p>Preach on, brother. I own both as well and can say each one has it&#8217;s pros and cons, just like anything else.</p>
<p>my dear fellow, we all get it, you are a &#8220;connoisseur&#8221; of finer things and we all apreciate your enduring admiration for iThings, but please don&#8217;t leave 201 comments like a douchebag, ok? Thank you.</p>
<p>It it was, then Apple might as well pack up and stop selling iPads for the duration of the year. For 200$ there are limitations on how much value you can get, even if its ridiculously good.</p>
<p>Lol, Mr Fanboy, how is the iPad not just a blown up iPhone? infact every review of the iPad when it was launched, their biggest complaint was that it was no different than the iPhone except for a bigger screen</p>
<p>Oh because there haven&#8217;t been 200,000 apps specifically designed to use the real estate the iPad provides since that has there&#8230; <strong>facepalm</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t throw that bollocks reasoning around when accusing people of being FanBoys. Pot, kettle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big Galaxy Nexus with updated software&#8230;. and the ipad is a big iphone with some upgrades&#8230;</p>
<p>You know, the iPad was knocked at release for being nothing more than a big iPod touch&#8230;so if that is the worst criticism of the Nexus 7, then I think the Nexus 7 is on the right path.</p>
<p>and the ajipad is a big itouch so what´s Up!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re hating man, I agree with you. I am excitingly waiting for Nexus 7 to arrive to my house, but I have no plans to ditch my iPad with LTE, the content for it is just to rich. It seems people think that all developers do is target the apps for the screens size but that is not the case. They get to experiment more and play around with the U.I., gestures and insert different technology to their apps that just couldn&#8217;t be possible on a phone. This makes the iPad apps a much more engaging experience and different from the very same apps available on the phone version.</p>
<p>So why did I get a Nexus 7? Well, I do love iOS and always will. I also have a soft spot for Android as well Windows Phone and most likely always will and I want to see how Project Butter improved things and I really need a small tablet just to take to the couch and to the can with me that is better than the Kindle Fire and this is it.   I would have just waited for Jelly Bean on Gnexus but the screen shattered recently and I sold it as is. I also hope HTC is making the next Nexus, but I could live with a Motorola Nexus as well. Man 2012-2013 might be an expensive year for me.. Next iPhone (iPhone 4s resell value take care most of that cost), Next Nexus (as long as it is not Samsung again) And maybe a beefy Windows Phone.</p>
<p>I guess you forgot the iPad is just a big iTouch&#8230;</p>
<p>Well the iPad was a bigger iPhone with updates software and hardware&#8230; Just saying. Lol.</p>
<p>Remember when everyone said the iPad was a large iPod? Funny how things never change. <br />
<blockquote>I’m not hating, it’s just not that amazing. It’s big Galaxy Nexus with updated software. A cool device but it’s just not better than the iPad.</blockquote></p>
<p>The exact same thing was said about the iPad when it was announced / released. It&#8217;s just a giant iPhone&#8230;</p>
<p>Taking this, &#8220;I’m not hating, it’s just not that amazing. It’s big Galaxy Nexus with updated software. A cool device but it’s just not better than the iPad.&#8221;</p>
<p>And saying this about the iPad, &#8220;I’m not hating, it’s just not that amazing. It’s big iPod with updated software. A cool device but it’s just not better than the Nexus 7.&#8221;</p>
<p>It really is amazing considering the price of it. It isn&#8217;t trying to be better than the iPad. It&#8217;s showing what you can get for a fraction of what you would pay for an iPad. I own an iPad 2 and still preordered the Nexus 7. I&#8217;m taken with the idea of a 7 inch tablet plus I was won over by seeing some of the games that were tailored specifically for Tegra 3 that actually look better than those on the A5x.</p>
<p>And so is Ipad a larger version on Itouch&#8230;</p>
<p>looks like you&#8217;re pretty well versed. I suppose you accidentally left out the tablet&#8217;s quad-core processors, outstanding battery life, and a high-resolution display. I suppose the premium-feel and portability of the tablet counts for nothing. I&#8217;m sorry, but keep buying your iDevices and be stuck in your Apple bubble. Not hatin&#8217;, just saying.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t compare the two. But what I can tell you is, if Apple made a 7&quot; iPad, it would not even come close to this.</p>
<p>I can also tell you that if Google releases a 10&quot; Nexus tablet, it will be much better than the iPad.</p>
<p>And stop the &#8220;lack of apps&#8221; myth already. Android has more than enough tablet apps &#8211; just because there&#8217;s (unfortunately) no special section in the Play store, that doesn&#8217;t mean those tens or hundreds of thousands of tablet optimized apps aren&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>Congrats, you responded to his ridiculous claim with your own.</p>
<p>Of course you can compare the two. It&#8217;s a tablet. I believe the reason they created a 7&quot; version &amp; not a 10&quot; was because they  knew they&#8217;d be directly compared to the iPad if they did. They chose to target easy tablets to best (The Fire &amp; Nook), &amp; they did best them. But it&#8217;s simply NOT better than an iPad, yet. It needs a better dedicated App selection, a better screen, better battery life &amp; a lot more content. It&#8217;s marketed as a media consumption device specifically to avoid comparison to the iPad which is just as much content creation as it is media consumption.</p>
<p>They created a 7&quot; as that&#8217;s where the opportunity is. The Kindle Fire proved that.</p>
<p> A 10&quot; would be a whole different headache and unnecessary for what this device is bringing to the table in terms of features, software and ecosystem.</p>
<p>I agree. I don&#8217;t think Google is ready to be compared to an iPad yet. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think they bothered with a 10 yet.</p>
<p>Google wants to wrestle back lost market share from the Kindle Fire, which used a forked version of Android.</p>
<p>The Kindle Fire didn&#8217;t really prove much of anything.</p>
<p>How has it not proven anything? There&#8217;s large demand for a 7&quot; tablet and the Kindle sales have proven that.</p>
<p>Well given the fact most people have to budget for things and like things cheap and Amazon is a huge brand with TV ads and the largest marketplace on the Internet it was easy to get it in front of billions of people world wide. They also even had retailer partnerships for it and a consumer base from it Kindles, a brand people already trusted. They had a strong presences that help sell the device.</p>
<p>Google has the brand thing down, but they also need to promote it online and offline as well get it into some stores. I doubt really anyone outside of the geek circle really has a clue to what it is at this point unlike the Kindle Fire.  Google would be smart to partner with Verizon and a Hotspot device for it like Apple did with the original iPad at the very least that way it is opened up to a bigger consumer base and faster.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever read so much that was true yet such utter bullshit at the same time.</p>
<p>People can&#8217;t like the Kindle Fire better than the iPad? They would <i>ONLY</i> buy a Fire tablet if they are budgeting or too stupid to shop around?</p>
<p>God damn that&#8217;s some serious fanboy logic you&#8217;ve got going there.</p>
<p>It became the hottest selling Android based tablet, didn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s a pretty ignorant statement.</p>
<p>Exactly. There is a big market for 7 inch tablets.<br />
There are two markets for tablets.<br />
The 7 inch market and the iPad.</p>
<p>Amazon had quite impressive sales of the Kindle Fire at the end of last year.  Along with that, they managed to cut Google completely out of the application market by releasing their own application store.</p>
<p>Long story short, it seems like a sensible move to go after them, to avoid a fragmented ecosystem run by every device manufacturer and cellular provider.  I&#8217;m sure direct iPad/Nexus competition will happen, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like a focus.</p>
<p>any % of market share for android tablet is a competition with iPad. they all fight in the same ring, but google is clever enough to figure out it is more easy to first &#8220;take over&#8221; the 7&#8217; market as apple is not there yet. it is much simpler for now to build the nexus brand and lure more android tablet app devs there first and then, with some solid base, to attack iPad directly with an 10&#8217; nexus.</p>
<p>from what we know, I think one day google will take over this market just as they did at the smartphone market. at this point, the competition is ONLY about the content, the OS is just as good as iOS and they actually can push better specs devices for less money. to me, it is a matter of time. on the other hand, apple is less and less flexible in development, as it is tied down by the success of iPad. google has nothing to loose and the hunger for experimentation is evident. I used to take the android as iOS rip off, but I think this year is the turning point and android is getting better, more dynamic and with more and more of original ideas. yes, samsung is ripping off heavily, but google is at least truing to do it&#8217;s own things and many of them are maybe half baked, but impressive in concept.</p>
<p>A 7 foot and 10 foot tablet would be cumbersome&#8230;</p>
<p>Microsoft sold something like that under the name &#8220;Surface&#8221; :) It&#8217;s now called something different.</p>
<p>A flyweight and a heavyweight fight in the same ring but no one thinks they are fighting against each other&#8230;</p>
<p>Reality Check.  There is one tablet market, with a finite amount of dollars consumers have to spend in it.   Every sale of one tablet not only takes away from another&#8217;s sale of one tablet&#8230;it also takes away a customer for the foreseeable future as the vast majority  will likely never leave the competitors ecosystem.  Therefore, anyone attempting to claim they don&#8217;t care about a subset of that easily scaleable tablet  market,   are ignorant of reality (posters) or putting on a Public Relation stunt until they enter it under guise of not entering it (Apple, reduced price of ipad 2).</p>
<p>In addition, getting a foothold in 7&quot; is hugely important for when a 10&quot; nexus is released and when such 7&quot; users go to buy their next tablet.</p>
<p>Which leads to my next point in resposne to everyone who has posted it or is even thinking it&#8230; no one is likely to switch once they begin down the ios or Android path, so spare us of all the irrelevant statements implying the competitor&#8217;s os is just not good enough for you to switch.  This is a fight for those new to the ecosystems-first time purchasers.</p>
<p>This is such a ridiculous argument you&#8217;re trying to uphold. Are you going to tell me you can compare a $20,000 Toyota to a $50,000 Lexus? Of course you can, but can you tell me it&#8217;s a fair comparison? <em>They&#8217;re both cars</em>, just like the Nexus 7 and iPad. A $200 tablet requires sacrifices, which in this case are the screen and battery.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s different? They target different niches in the market, and in this case, a niche where there was more opportunity. Perhaps an iPad 2 is the better purchase, but you&#8217;ll get 2 decent media consumption devices for that price.</p>
<p>Wait, what? I can&#8217;t get a Porsche GT3 for Honda Civic money???</p>
<p>At the end of the day, both cars still get you from point A to point B.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not where you&#8217;re going, it&#8217;s how you get there.</p>
<p>The internet just looks better on an iPad when compared to an Android tablet. Don&#8217;t you know? The roads just look better when I&#8217;m in my STi instead of my sister&#8217;s plain old Impreza.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Road looks much better in my Evo compared to your STi /s</p>
<p>And at the same speeds with similar efficiency!</p>
<p>Or a Nissan Leaf to a Tesla Model S?</p>
<p>Are you gonna start comparing netbooks to gaming laptops as well?</p>
<blockquote>It needs a better dedicated App selection, a better screen, better battery life &amp; a lot more content.</blockquote>
<p>So&#8230; Does that statement make MacBook Pro with Retina display a laptop with a not good enough display?!?!?!?!<br />
Also it&#8217;s better than an iPad, simple because you can run 2 applications side by side at the same price!</p>
<p>Or you can look at it for what it really is.  It&#8217;s a 7 inch tablet that&#8217;s meant to usurp sales from the Kindle Fire.  Amazon is the only Android &#8216;OEM&#8217; that has managed to sidestep Google&#8217;s rules and it uses its own App Store to sidestep Google Play.  Why wouldn&#8217;t Google want to target that device?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not marketed as an iPad competitor because it isn&#8217;t one.  Google isn&#8217;t stupid.  There is no tablet that is an iPad &#8216;killer&#8217;.  Everyone knows that in the tablet space the iPad is king right now.  Google isn&#8217;t trying to take out the most popular tablet.  They&#8217;re trying to take out the most popular ANDROID tablet.  And the Nexus 7 is perfect for that IMO.</p>
<p>You can sit here all day and hoot and holler about how the iPad is better and how they didn&#8217;t make it 10 inches because they didn&#8217;t want to compete with it&#8230;but unless you&#8217;re completely nuts you have to understand that was never their intention.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>How do you &#8216;know&#8217; this? <br />
Are you a witch? Don&#8217;t come to our website with your black magic and devil worship. Be away with you.</p>
<p>Oh, can I have next week&#8217;s lottery numbers?</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a witch?&#8221;</p>
<p>I almost fell out of my chair.</p>
<p>What app store are you looking in?  And I can&#8217;t wait to see how many accessories will be avalible for this, probably close to none. And what happend to the update alliance they made such a big deal about last year. Good luck getting an update, nexus or not.</p>
<p>I get timely updates on my Galaxy Nexus. What exactly do you mean &#8220;good luck getting an update&#8221;?</p>
<p>The troll is strong with this one.</p>
<p>Nexus means updates direct from Google. You won&#8217;t need the update alliance to work.</p>
<p>talk about a reality distortion field.</p>
<p>TIL there are hundreds of thousands of tablet optimized apps for android. Why didn&#8217;t google just say so?</p>
<p>Oh that&#8217;s right, because there aren&#8217;t that many.</p>
<p>Assuming the rumoured 7&quot; iPad is based on the iPad 2, with the same resolution display and SoC, then on specs at least the Nexus 7 will completely blow it away. Far, far faster CPU/GPU, and a higher res screen. Plus more RAM too.</p>
<p>Then again iOS has far more tablet apps, but you have to offset that against the price of the Nexus, and the superiority of Android. I say that as an iOS user who is sick of Apple&#8217;s failure to do anything of note with iOS, &#8211; they seem only capable of ruining the UI with hideous skeumorphic design and of course, ripping out Google Maps to use their own vastly inferior maps.</p>
<p>The Nexus looks pretty damn tempting, and I don&#8217;t even need a tablet. (I have an iPad, and rarely use it)</p>
<p>Not to mention in a few months after this monster&#8217;s release the android ecosystem should be considerably buffed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll take more than months to match the Tablet App ecosystem of Apple. The Nexus 7 may blow away a 7 in iPad as far as screen resolution is concerned but it won&#8217;t in terms of software options &amp; hardware, I assume, will match that of the new iPad more-so than the iPad 2. Making it, in my opinion, still a better buy as it&#8217;ll have a lower price point as well.</p>
<p>Why do I hear that evey year?  It&#8217;s allways it&#8217;s comming, it will be better with the next update and so on. Keep up the faith maybe in 20 years you will have that. But not now or the near future.</p>
<p>Android has gotten leaps and bounds better. Or are you just blind to that fact?</p>
<p>And yes, it IS fact. ICS blows Gingerbread out of the water and Jelly Bean is even better than ICS.</p>
<p>I agree. JB is the first time I&#8217;ve looked at android and thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s as polished as iOS.&#8221;</p>
<p>I probably won&#8217;t be going full android, but I may save my pennies for a Nexus 7.</p>
<p>I think he&#8217;s talking about Android tablet apps, which so far have failed to happen.</p>
<p>There actually is a ton of tablet optimized apps for Android. So yeah ,things really did change a lot.</p>
<p>I guess the benchmark app is Garage band. Which indeed is &#8220;missing&#8221; (or rather &#8220;not available&#8221;) on Android. Maybe Google should make something like that to get this nonsensical argument out of the way.</p>
<p>Not going to happen until google fixes their audio layer. Way too much latency.</p>
<p>Jellybean already takes care of that issue.  13ms latency for audio.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll wait and se on that, they said that with the Xoom, Transformer and tab 10.1.</p>
<p>None of those were released with Android 4.x which is leaps and bounds better than Android 2.x and 3.&#215;.</p>
<p>They said that about 3.0 when the Xoom was released.</p>
<p>And I experienced Android 3.0 which sucked. I have ICS on my Xoom and now Jelly Bean on my Galaxy Nexus and I can safely say it&#8217;s far better than Honeycomb.</p>
<p>Even Android users recognize that Honeycomb was a half-assed attempt at a tablet OS.</p>
<p>As Matias Duarte would call it, &#8220;it&#8217;s an emergency landing&#8221; OS. They needed to get something out&#8230;fast!</p>
<p>Android 3 on a tablet was leaps and bounds better than 2.x on a tablet.<br />
BUT Android 3 was the first version designed for actual tablet use!<br />
ICS and Jelly Bean are the first chance to make changes since this.<br />
People do realise that don&#8217;t they??!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m fairly sure I&#8217;ve seen benchmarks that show the PowerVR GPU in the iPad to be &#8216;better&#8217; than the Tegra, the benchmarks presented here <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6054/google-nexus-7-mini-review" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6054/google-nexus-7-mini-review</a> appear to show this, but of course the software used to test could be completely skewed to the iPad.</p>
<p>Benchmarks do show speed and fillrate, which are generous on the new iPad no doubt.  What it fails to mention is how limited graphically the PowerVR chipset is in what it can render, while the tegra chipset has its roots in nvidia&#8217;s PC architecture so it has shaders and can run much more complex geometry.  Games play equally well on both, but the tegra 3 has more graphical flair and effects.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t kid yourself. The 7&quot; ipad, just like the iTV has been rumored for years. Just like the iPhone mini&#8230;and on and on and on.</p>
<p>These things will never happen. Stop trolling this article with such nonsense.</p>
<p>The iphone mini? You mean it can actually get a smaller screen than it has now?</p>
<p>Specs and performance are two different things.  Superiority of Android?  Stopping there.</p>
<p>Ok, so the whole point about iOS having more tablet optimized apps goes out the window if they scale back to a 7&quot; screen.  One major reason iOS Devs are able to optimize apps for tablets is because they only have 1 screen size to deal with.  Android however has a multitude of tablet sizes making app scaling and optimization more difficult.  If Apple busts out a 7 inch iPad they will have to either stretch iPhone apps, shrink iPad apps, or develop a specific version for the new 7&quot; screen.</p>
<p>Well then I guess its a good thing that it wasn&#8217;t intended to compete with the iPad huh?</p>
<p>i think this is a great tablet, it seems like google knocked it out of the park, unfortunately content is what makes a tablet and if you don&#8217;t have it it doesn&#8217;t matter how good your tablet is, the good news is that can all be fixed with time</p>
<p>huh? So your saying this tablet doesn&#8217;t have content???</p>
<p>What about Google Play? Movies, Music, TV Shows, Books, Magazines. <br />
What about Netflix and Hulu? They run on Android tablets. <br />
What about the Kindle and Nook Apps? They also run on Android. <br />
What about the Audible App? it runs on Android. <br />
What about podcast?<br />
What about 600,000 apps? <br />
What about a huge number of fantastic games?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t 2 years ago. Android has come a long way. Apps and games have come a long way.</p>
<p>God I really hate this about tech. People get these ideas in their heads early on, and it&#8217;s so hard to shake an idea once it&#8217;s formed. The idea that Android doesn&#8217;t have quality apps is completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>There is a ton of content available for this and all the other Android tablets. I think instant streaming is the only thing the Fire has over other tablets. But where Android is seriously lacking is in developer support, at least where tablets are concerned. I do think the Nexus 7 will go a long way to getting developers interested but there are other considerations, like the revenue model Google uses vs Apple&#8217;s. I would be surprised if the big guns, like Facebook, Twitter, etc aren&#8217;t already working on versions of their apps that take advantage of this form factor, but there are other touchstone apps and developers, like Flipboard, that need to move in and make the effort.</p>
<p>maybe i should have clarified, not as much content as the competition, also i can&#8217;t download google play content from germany (if there is a fix for this can anyone help?) so the ipad is a better solution for me (and torrent isn&#8217;t an option out here because they actually punish people with a fine in the mail, i have seen it first hand)</p>
<p>it has enough stuff to start. i t will grow by time.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a competitor to the iPad, nor is it intended as one. If Apple do produce a retina display sporting 7&quot; tablet (a form factor they have ridiculed) and it is competitive on price, then yes, it might be the better buy. Google are obviously trying to develop the Android tablet market with this release, the intention is to make the platform worth the developers&#8217; time. By all indications this could be the machine that does it for them. This is a very smart move.</p>
<p>its a completely different market, its a media consumption device, which the N7 is not</p>
<p>It depends on what the consumer needs.</p>
<p>I`m an Apple freak, there are two iPads in my house a 1 &amp; 2.<br />
Niether work for me as I want a tablet for lazing around surfing the net &amp; reading and they`re just too /bigheavy.</p>
<p>I`ve been waiting for a good quality 7&quot; tablet since the first iPad came out.<br />
I think this is the one.</p>
<p>Exactly why I ordered one.  The iPad is great.  It&#8217;s just not a great couch surfing/bed reading device.  This is.</p>
<p>one handed thing is what makes this right. i completely agree.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not aimed at the iPad. At all. It&#8217;s a $200, 7&quot; tablet. How could that possibly be construed as remotely comparable to the iPad, except in the minds of click-baiting tech writers?</p>
<p>This is a Kindle Fire competitor, and there it succeeds with flying colors. Any mention of the word &#8220;iPad&#8221; in a review of the Nexus 7 &#8212; particularly in the headline! &#8212; should immediately tell you that the article is not worth reading.</p>
<blockquote>if Apple comes out with a 7&quot; version of the iPad 2/3, I’d argue that it’d still be a better buy than the Nexus 7.</blockquote>
<p>It will also be twice the price, which would make it no competitor at all. It would be a different product aimed at a different user base.</p>
<p>You mean a different income bracket</p>
<p>You have no clue what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>
<p>Sure the iPad&#8217;s better in many ways.  But the price is just not justifiable if you don&#8217;t have a use case that involves iPad productivity apps (I don&#8217;t mean Facebook&#8230;I mean Pages, Garage Band, etc.).  All those tablet apps are useless if you have no specific need for productivity apps on the iPad.  If you&#8217;re buying an iPad to browse and check Facebook, then the iPad really is a bigger iPod Touch for you.</p>
<p>250 000 apps.  Big deal.  I don&#8217;t have a quarter million bucks to spend on apps.  I care only about the apps I use regularly.  On a daily basis those apps are the browser, GMail, Maps, Flipboard, Pulse, Facebook, Twitter, etc.  And guess what?  These will work fine on this device.</p>
<p>Do I care that some aren&#8217;t optimized for tablets?  Not in the least.  As long as they are functional, it&#8217;s fine.  If functionality is as good as it is on my phone, what am I really missing out on?</p>
<p>The iPad&#8217;s size also comes with disadvantages.  Namely weight.  Try reading in bed with an iPad.  It sucks.  And how likely are you to really carry around an iPad compared to a smaller device like this?</p>
<p>None of this is to say the iPad is a terrible device.  It&#8217;s an amazing device.  But you really have to ask yourself if it&#8217;s worthwhile spending $500 if all you&#8217;re going to do is browse, read eBooks, watch movies, etc.  Different ballgame if you&#8217;re going to use iWork, iLife or other real tablet software.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still considering getting an iPad, cause it&#8217;ll integrate well with my iMac,  Apple TV, Airport and iPod.  But the Nexus 7 has effectively quelled the temptation for another year.  I can now wait for the iPad to hit the specs I actually want&#8230;.I was supremely annoyed that Apple gimped the new iPad with a VGA front facing camera.</p>
<p>As for Apple making a 7 incher, I&#8217;m not going to say never, but I can&#8217;t see it happening.  First, they&#8217;d be spitting on Jobs&#8217; grave.  Next, Apple is just not competitive in the shallow end of the pool.  Nothing wrong with that.  It&#8217;s just not in their DNA.  Asus has slim margins on this.  Google is selling at cost, hoping to get more profit from content.  If you think of Apple&#8217;s margins and the likelihood that Apple would offer a slightly better device (better casing, few missing hardware pieces, it would probably be $300.  The gulf between $200 and $300 is huge for consumers.  So it either won&#8217;t sell all that well, or would steal iPad 2 sales, or both.  A pointless proposition for Apple when they are selling every iPad they can make.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2/jtr.jpg" />I&#8217;m amazed by the engineering of this devide. <img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2fj/fvx.jpg" /></p>
<p>its $200. Holy fuck, and it&#8217;s been said and done, Google is no longer trying to compete. Also. No shit iPad is $500. You can buy 2 Nexus 7 for the price of 1 iPad.</p>
<p>True, it is hard to compete with apple especially when according to Hipster #1 @7:15 Google &#8220;makes youtube&#8221; thus their issue streaming HD content is odd.  This is a 1st party alternative to Amazon who has all the infrastructure it needs to eat away at some mountain view money.  They could really care less about supporting it, they just want to have something in place to make kindle folks on the fence go google instead of amazon and not even know they aren&#8217;t getting anything but skinned android, gingerbread none the less.  Doesn&#8217;t matter, fire&#8217;s sell and google wants an android OEM to get a piece of it.</p>
<p>You are comparing Apples with peaches son.. How on earth would you expect a 190 dollar device to be equal to or heck even better than an iPad that costs 300 bucks more?</p>
<p>Since it cost less than 1/3 the price, I don&#8217;t think you can compare them even in the slightest.  It&#8217;s a high quality tablet that hits a perfect price point for people looking for a tablet that don&#8217;t want or need a $600+ tablet.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it hilarious how every time there&#8217;s  a positive review of an Android product the Apple fanboys have to jump in and tell us how it&#8217;s still not as good as an iPhone/iPad etc? Frankly we don&#8217;t care! We&#8217;re here to read about the Nexus 7, not Crapple.  I bought a Nexus 7 and I couldn&#8217;t be happier. Everyone who has seen it is impressed and many are seriously considering buying one. Personally I find Apple products to be way overpriced and incredibly boring. Your opinion here is completely pointless. If you want Apple that&#8217;s fine but we really don&#8217;t care that you think it&#8217;s better. Don&#8217;t go away mad, just go away.</p>
<p>That, and the lack of 4G is a deal killer for me. I don&#8217;t want to have to tether&#8230;</p>
<p>A well designed app shouldn&#8217;t be tablet centric. Look at Google+. That&#8217;s the ideal way to do it. But iOS users think that having to pay for an iPhone version AND an iPad version is a feature, when it is actually FRAGMENTATION.</p>
<p>is it just me or do gifs speed up the longer i look at them</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s just you.<br />
Go see a doctor ASAP.</p>
<p>You might be dying.</p>
<p>Same, I&#8217;m gonna get one despite already owning an iPad. I haven&#8217;t yet tried anything android flavour, so it will be nice to try it out.</p>
<p>I carried an iPad to and from work in my previous job and as much as I love the iPad I think a smaller tablet is much more convenient.  But I think I&#8217;ll wait to see Amazon&#8217;s response before I buy.</p>
<p>I think the only way for Amazon&#8217;s next offering to be relevant is for the OS to be built on Android 4.&#215;. Otherwise, no amount of hardware will warrant the purchase.</p>
<p>If they neuter the UI like they did with the Fire, the specs won&#8217; t matter much.</p>
<p>The screen resolution certainly matters.</p>
<p>I like that thought. I think the Nexus 7 will be my &#8216;out in public&#8217; tablet (if I like it). I&#8217;m always scared to lose, damage or have my expensive iPad stolen.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s response will still be a skinned tablet stripped of all it&#8217;s Googleness. And the Google stuff is the best part. It probably won&#8217;t have Jelly Bean and instead be based on ICS, and even so it will be so customized that ICS won&#8217;t even matter.</p>
<p>The fire won&#8217;t get things like Google Now and the new notifications. It won&#8217;t be a &#8220;complete tablet&#8221; the way the Nexus 7 is.</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think it matters what Amazon does, it won&#8217;t be better than this as long as they layer it with their own skin and subvert the heart of Android.</p>
<p>At this point, the KF is only relevant if you&#8217;re a hardcore Amazon fan.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say the Kindle Fire 2 matches the Nexus 7 specs (I doubt it&#8230;) which should you get?</p>
<p>KF for maybe the discounted Prime membership.  But that&#8217;s it.  With the Kindle Fire you are locked into Amazon&#8217;s App Store.  And you&#8217;re stuck on their version of Gingerbread when in about a year (well shorter than the life of the device) most users will be on Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean and most developers will start coding apps and games at this level.</p>
<p>Get a Nexus 7 and you can just download the Amazon App Store and access Amazon content.  Yet, you&#8217;ll still get all the native Google Apps.  And you can access other content stores.  Win-Win.</p>
<p>If all things are equal I&#8217;ll get the Nexus, even if they arent&#8217; that equal.  I&#8217;ll get the KF only if it&#8217;s much better&#8230; nah fuck that, I bought my teen a KF and it kind of defeats the purpose of android.  Ok I&#8217;m getting this.</p>
<p>Man, Android adoption is totally rate is totally tied at the hip with two-year contracts, so unless something crazy happens like we&#8217;ve never seen before ICS wont be dominant until 2014. There&#8217;s a very dedicated and loud group of people who are early adopters but not enough to force a landslide change. I&#8217;m inclined to believe it&#8217;s got to do with the retail cycle. Not saying it wont be more present in a year, but just its just got off to real whimper of a start. Look at the wayback machine for comparable data: <a href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/20110801000000*/http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html" target="new">2010/2011 snapshots</a></p>
<p>You realise the KF2 is right around the corner don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Amazon Video. That&#8217;s the differentiation. The leaked .apks still don&#8217;t work on anything other than a fire.</p>
<p>I was thinking the exact same thing.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly.. I think I&#8217;m gonna preorder this baby sometime this weekend.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly</p>
<p>Interesting times! Google owns the 7&quot; space, Apple has 9.7&quot; and Microsoft will probably nail 10.6&quot;.</p>
<p>pretty good assessment.</p>
<p>How do they own the 7 inch space with a tablet that isn&#8217;t even out yet? Must be all the other success they have had with other tablets.</p>
<p>Well, the Kindle IS built on Android and it is by FAR the most popular 7&quot; tablet available so by proxy Google does own the 7&quot; space.</p>
<p>So you know haw many fires have sold then?  You must have numbers to back that up?</p>

<p>Want more?</p>
<p>Do you have any article that also mentions wombats?</p>
<p>why do fools fall in love?</p>
<p>Sure.  How about actual sales numbers from Amazon?</p>
<p>What?  They&#8217;re not available?  So everyone is just guessing?  Yep.</p>
<p>Yes, everyone is just throwing out random numbers. It&#8217;s ok, you don&#8217;t have to believe it as long as the investors do.</p>
<p>HA!</p>
<p>9.7&quot; and 10.6&quot; are the same market.</p>
<p>Apple won&#8217;t make a 7&quot; tablet anyways.</p>
<p>1. They won&#8217;t sacrifice enough design and quality to get to $199<br />
2. They won&#8217;t sell something at a low enough profit margin to get to $199<br />
3. They hate adding new resolution support to their OS and only do it when they have to. (Although I suppose a 7&quot; at iPad 2 resolution would make sense)</p>
<p>They can make a premium one and charge more, people are always willing to pay more for apple.  the fans know with apple you get a premium product at a premium price.  And then there are those that will buy anything apple puts out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I see happening. Apple releases a 7&quot; iPad in the fall with the launch of the new iPhone. Same internals as the new iPad, and a retina display arround the same DPI as the iPad. It will probably replace the iPod touch, and will always trail the newest iPad as far as internals go, but it will always receive the features of the version of iOS released w/ the iPhone.</p>
<p>And it will start at $250 with $100 jumps for larger storage.</p>
<p>And they would also suddenly be directly compared to products like the Nexus 7. And comparing a great product at $199 to a great product at $299 or higher would usually end favorably to the cheaper product.</p>
<p>Not to mention that this is just silly. Apple will never release a 7&quot; tablet. Give it up. Stop talking about such nonsense that will never happen, has never even been remotely likely to happen.</p>
<p>The product at $299 comes with 250,000 apps while the $199 product has phone apps.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a new iPad for $299?</p>
<p>Phone AND tablet apps.</p>
<p>That is unless the 7 inch tablet market is a resounding success, and it results in a loss of sales for the 10&quot; iPad.</p>
<p>Would they really though?</p>
<p>If Apple makes a 7 inch tablet, it&#8217;s going to be at least $300.  It still won&#8217;t be competitive with this.  And it might cannibalize some higher margin iPad 2 sales.</p>
<p>Premium customers will just buy the iPad 2.</p>
<p>But this is where you&#8217;re wrong. Apple&#8217;s products aren&#8217;t &#8220;premium&#8221; in quality or specs, they&#8217;re &#8220;premium&#8221; only in their price.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t even make a laptop that could be compared to a PC laptop that&#8217;s half the price and twice the specs.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on their computers. They&#8217;re a complete joke compared to what you can put together in 10 minutes for 1/4th the price.</p>
<p>Yes of course, let me just go put together a laptop of the same quality and thinness of the MacBook Pro.. oh wait, I cant.</p>
<p>Yes Apple products cost a lot, but don&#8217;t be so silly, the build quality is amazing and nothing matches it. I wish I could find a PC manufacturer who made something remotely similar.</p>
<p>The products are premium in that they are made from excellent materials, the designs are superb and so is the detailing.</p>
<p>This is the same as in many other sectors &#8211; there are cheap and expensive options. The expensive options will tend to have much better materials/detailing etc.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to like or want Apple products, but dont be so silly as to suggest they are somhow the same as a plasticy cheap items, or that you can easily go buy a machine with the same build quality/</p>
<p>Then again people are different &#8211; you probably dont see why people like Mercedes/Porsche/Aston Martins, and think a souped up Astra is somehow the same</p>
<p>Well done Google. This is really a solid device and an amazing price &#8211; granted, it needs a little work, but don&#8217;t all products at launch?</p>
<p>If I weren&#8217;t so heavily invested in the Microsoft Ecosystem I&#8217;d hop on this! (I&#8217;m waiting on Windows 8 Devices :X)</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with your statement. I really hope Google pushes out a Nexus 10 next year though!</p>
<p>I agree, of course I would say let them, so Google can sure Apple like they sued Samsung. Seriously, the lawsuits they began against Samsung don&#8217;t have any teeth. Anyone remember the Prada came before the iPhone?</p>
<p>Your comment makes no sense.  Google hasn&#8217;t sued anybody, they were sued by Oracle and won.  Apple sued Samsung, and every other android manufacturer, probably hoping to stop android by proxy.</p>
<p>Oh joy. Another copycat tablet, just in time for the next round of patent-infringement summary judgements and preliminary injunctions. What will Google replicate next?</p>
<p>Full screen tablet and phone? Check. Smooth and responsive touchscreen software? We&#8217;re still working on that one. Hardware with an Apple look and feel? Sort of. Siri-like, female personal assistant with attitude for US voice search? Check, but we had to go with a sci-fi knock-off voice with less personality, fewer answers and more advertiser responses.</p>
<p>Inexpensive, AppleTV-like media box? Check, but it&#8217;s actually kind of pricey and looks more like a Magic 8 Ball. First-rate App Store and ecosystem? Um, hold on there, chief. Legendary Apple quality, desirability, tech support and customer sevice? Err, wait a second.</p>
<p>Google spyware that tracks every online activity, notifies advertisers and is &#8220;open&#8221; for hackers? Check. Check. Check.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get why most people just wouldn&#8217;t get an original &#8211; the Apple iPad or iPod Touch. In fact, I believe they will. And if Apple does release a 7-inch tablet in the fall, as rumored, I pity the developers and buyers who settle for this, or other knock-offs. This device may interest  Amazon cheapskates and Android geeks, but I can&#8217;t imagine it will motivate the masses, especially Apple buyers who expect the very best.</p>
<p>Finally, I also wonder why the Googlopoly is producing a smaller tablet that won&#8217;t fit into standard, double-DIN automotive dashboard openings. Why 7.85 inches? Why not 7 inches? Oh well, what&#8217;s another product or two that slightly misses a target market&#8230;</p>
<p>Hostile much?  Dude, chill.  Choice is good.  Anger is bad.  Be cool.  R-E-L-A-X.</p>
<p>These Google devices are all about tracking your online activities. You pay for the &#8220;low-cost&#8221; &#8212; with your privacy. See: &#8220;How a lone grad student uncovered the Google privacy scandal&#8221;:<br />

<p>Indeed, the Verge team is being generous to Android today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a $200 tablet that&#8217;s basically an Ipad without a 10&#8217;&#8217; screen.  I&#8217;d say that warrants some praise considering the price point of an Ipad.</p>
<p>Indeed, old chap. I&#8217;d say, I want one myself.</p>
<p>Holy magicarp, is this the first android tablet that has sccored a bigger number than 8?</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.videogum.com/files/2012/02/shocked3.gif" /></p>
<p>Well.. Second&#8230; <br />
<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2601558/asus-eee-pad-transformer-prime-review" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/1/2601558/asus-eee-pad-transformer-prime-review</a></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best score, they have given to a tablet ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing the new iPad at 9.3</p>
<p>Its amazing that the Nexus 7 scored an 8.8 despite scoring so low on the camera, battery life and ecosystem sections. If it would have had a good rear camera and a bigger battery that thing would have easily crossed the 9 mark. But on another note, Engadget has the battery on the Nexus 7 lasting the same as the iPad in their battery rundown test.</p>
<p>Overall scores they give are not an average, not even a weighted average.</p>
<p>Which is a great thing, because if it got a lower rating just because it didn&#8217;t have a back-facing camera&#8230; I&#8217;d be pretty ticked. Like Josh said, &quot; If you’re one of those people who likes to snap pics with their tablet — first, shame on you.&quot;</p>
<p>Camera should have been lower.</p>
<p>Why? It has a front-facing camera, which is the camera that matters.</p>
<p>Supposedly the battery life is over 9 hours. This is the thing with quick reviews like this. They don&#8217;t really get a good grasp of battery life. But the stated battery life is over 9 hours. That&#8217;s great for a 7&quot; tablet and right up there with the iPad.</p>
<p>The camera is a front facing camera. Intended for video chat and not for picture taking. So of course it&#8217;s not given much weight as I&#8217;m sure it does great for what it&#8217;s intended to do&#8230;.Video Skype, Google Talk Video messages, etc.</p>
<p>Verge rated the battery at 6 hours and Engadget around 8. Your milage may vary.</p>
<p>If you play video, the battery life will probably be well over 9 hours. For CPU intensive tasks like web browsing, the battery life is a lot shorter.</p>
<p>Except it&#8217;s BETTER than an iPad without a 10&quot; screen. Huzzah!</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t compare them with such different screen sizes. I&#8217;ve owned a 7&quot; and a 10&quot; tablet, I can tell you those are totally different things.</p>
<p>Would it be better than an iPad if they had the same screen size? Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>Just add a 1080p or better display and raise the price point to 250$ for the 8Gb version and I&#8217;d say that is undeniably true, now that Android is such a mature operating system.</p>
<p>but then you could store one tv show, and run out of space&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a better screen would cost less than $50, thus giving Google a bigger margin and allowing for more storage. I mean 8 gigs of storage probably costs like $5 or less, so i can&#8217;t imagine it would be a problem.</p>
<p>Ah, such a naive view. For a start, panels of that density are harder to come by. Then you&#8217;re pushing the GPU harder &#8211; can it keep up? You&#8217;re pushing the battery harder &#8211; how do you balance battery life? What seems like a simple layman &#8220;just add a better screen with no consequences!&#8221; actually has a lot of effect on the entire device&#8217;s cost and design.</p>
<p>Just look at the iPad 3 for this in practice &#8211; The display is lovely, but it can&#8217;t game to the same visual quality as the iPad 2 and it takes twice as long to charge for the same run time.</p>
<p>Compromise is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>Well the 3rd gen iPad can game with much better visual effects than the iPad 2 at iPad 2 resolution.  Just not with the same visual effects at 3rd gen iPad resolution :)</p>
<p>One of the reasons I&#8217;m buying the Nexus 7 and holding off for the next iPad.</p>
<p>True. Not naïve, just barely conscious 3AM haha<br />
I wish I didn&#8217;t agree. I JUST WANT A RETINA 7in TABLET, JEEZ.  ):</p>
<p>2013 Nexus 8 specs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not better than an iPad. It&#8217;s close, but not quite.</p>
<p>ipad isn&#8217;t quad core cpu&#8230;. its a DUAL core CPU with a QUAD CORE CPU. The nexus is a quad core CPU (really 5 cores) with a 12 core GPU!</p>
<p>Your CPU comparison has some merit as they are basically the same architecture.  It would be interesting to see which real world applications benefit &#8211; I haven&#8217;t seen it yet but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s out there somewhere?</p>
<p>Your GPU comparison is completely meaningless.  The 12 cores in the Tegra 3 are not as powerful as a quad core PowerVR SGX543MP4.  You can not just count cores across different architectures and make any kind of assumption about performance.  Counting transistors would be a step in a better direction.</p>
<p>You are discounting the architecture though, the tegra 3 is based off of nvidia&#8217;s pc line-up and thus comes with programmable shaders that the PowerVR lacks, so the tegra can actually have more effects with less effect on performance.<br />
The only real feather in the PowerVR&#8217;s hat is its ability to push pixels, the fill rate on it is very very high.  While the memory bandwidth is the limiting factor for tegra 3, which is why in the newer implementations it gets faster ram and has no trouble with the higher resolution of the transformer pad infinity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s basically an ipad without the 10&quot; screen <strong>or the 250,000 tablet specific apps</strong>.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s a kindle fire without the quality controlled amazon app store to keep the crappy, non tablet apps from showing up.</p>
<p>Tablet specific apps is a dumb idea. Apps should adapt to the full range of devices. As Duarte explains in the interview.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s incredibly annoying to have different apps for each device.</p>
<p>As a phone and tablet app developer, I disagree with you in part.</p>
<p>There are a certain number of my apps I just would not want people to run on their phones, because it would guarantee a worse experience (coding apps, painting apps, for example). And I wouldn&#8217;t want to be responsible for that poor user experience.</p>
<p>Also there is one game we have developed that can just not be played on a phone — as it requires four simultaneous touches with two hands. Anything lower than a 9&quot; screen for that game is very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But for a large selection of apps (especially information consumption apps), having them run on both phone and tablet is a very good idea.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s another matter. Sure you can restrict apps from being used on certain devices.</p>
<p>The point is that IF an app is supposed to run on the full range of devices, you should not have a different app for a small phone, big phone, 7&quot;tablet and then a 10&quot;tablet. One app should simply be able to work on all those. It should also work pretty much the same way on all these devices. Just use the extra screen real estate for combining functionality on a bigger screen.</p>
<p>Again I agree in part — I think the app should be the same for both tablet and phone devices (i.e. universal binary or whatever). But some apps need drastically re-designed UIs to work on a smaller (or larger) screen.</p>
<p>Look at Apple&#8217;s iPhoto, Keynote, and Numbers apps. They&#8217;ve re-imagined the workflow for them when they run on iPhone. It&#8217;s really good, and well thought out (I was amazed that Keynote was actually usable at phone size). These are very complicated applications, and they really need a lot of thought about how you approach them at different sizes. The tablet interface for iPhoto on a phone would be ridiculously cluttered and would just not work.</p>
<p>So for a lot of simpler apps, I agree with you — they can mostly preserve their form and show more content. But when you get to more advanced and complex interactions you start to need dedicated designs for different device forms.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say more content, but more functionality. Like showing a menu in a column on the left for a tablet device  (in landscape orientation!) and have the menu on a separate screen from the content on a phone.</p>
<p>True, though I think it goes a bit deeper than optional menus. Sometimes the app&#8217;s design needs to be started from scratch for an alternate form factor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve done this a few times with the universal apps I&#8217;ve developed — I was able to reuse some code (individual views) but the best result came when I went back to the design stage and threw everything away. Then thought about how my users would approach the app on a different device, what emotions they would feel, how much time they would have, and so on.</p>
<p>So in the end you essentially design two apps that share some implementation code. I don&#8217;t think this is a bad way to do things, you end up creating a very focused experience on every device you support.</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>Twitter on a phone works great with just a single column table view.  On a tablet (even 7&quot;) every tweet becomes only a single line long, and is a pain to read and looks ugly. Go to 10 inches and it is even worse.</p>
<p>Phone apps are designed with a single pane of content as that is about all you can fit. A tablet should have more than that.</p>
<p>Yes, so add more columns on a tablet. What&#8217;s your issue?</p>
<p>You are only correct in regards to apps that have both phone and tablet apps separately available, rather than unifying.</p>
<p>I was predicting the score would be 8.4, but I don&#8217;t think 8.8 is too high. It&#8217;s pretty incredible what you&#8217;re getting for the price. If they sell a lot of these which they likely will, there will be pressure for devs to get their Android apps working great on tablets.</p>
<p>If they sell a lot? <br />
I pre-ordered two just on the announcement. <br />
Google/Asus has hit a home run on this Tab.</p>
<p>Two isn&#8217;t a lot ;)</p>
<p>(yes, lots of people are excited, and I&#8217;ll probably buy at least 1 for my mom, but the verge could all buy 1 and it wouldn&#8217;t sell &#8220;a lot&#8221;. The metric these days is in the millions. Let&#8217;s not ramp the expectations too high, considering how little known success Google has had with their other Nexus devices.)</p>
<p>But with the phones there were other choices that were as good or better and cheaper.  This kicks every android tablets ass. anyone who&#8217;s been holding out will probably jump on this one. j</p>
<p>But most people probably won&#8217;t even know it exists.</p>
<p>In the video review, Josh browsed to the NYTimes, where there was a prominent ad for the Nexus 7. Not Apple-level marketing, but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be at least some consumer awareness.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s remember who makes all those advertisements you see on web pages appear&#8230; I think Google can make their tablet known.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Nexus is one of the best phones available. It was the best phone at the time. Since it&#8217;s so much cheaper than the Galaxy SIII and One X, I&#8217;d say it still is the best option for most people buying a smartphone now.</p>
<p>Yet they aren&#8217;t selling much Galaxy Nexii. Or at least not nearly enough as they should be selling based on the merits of the device.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not accounting for the fact that there are no carrier restrictions or favorites being played against them now. All the previous nexus devices were pretty much ignored by carriers that were supposed to be selling them. I would bet that Google sells more nexus 7&#8217;s by Christmas than all nexus phones combined up to this point.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2/jtr.jpg" />Some apps scale fine from Android phones to tablets but having a developer specifically spend time to make those tablet apps perfect is what he means. You obviously have never compared iPad apps to Android tablet apps otherwise you would not be so defensive. <img src="http://www.mynewcarquote.us/it2fj/fvx.jpg" /></p>
<p>Google is giving him cash, so what&#8217;d you expect?</p>
<p>What&#8217;re we gonna do?!</p>
<p>Prepare for Android tablet domination</p>
<p><img src="http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs47/f/2009/226/8/f/MechWarrior_Mercs_Wallpaper_6_by_Mecha_Master.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m calling it now. 1.5 million activations by Christmas</p>
<p>Double that just in the US.</p>
<p>I think he means per day&#8230;</p>
<p>Has to.<br />
Kindle Fire did over a million in a short Christmas shopping window in the US alone.</p>
<p>This&#8217;ll blow that away. Although I expect Google &amp; Asus will keep the numbers close to their chest for competitive reasons.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll need a serious ad campaign to get more of these to the general public&#8230;  It&#8217;ll sell well through tech enthusiasts and word of mouth, but I hope Google can augment this with some quality advertising.</p>
<p>A singe, very popular android tablet other than the kindle fire can work wonders for the ecosystem this year.</p>
<p>They seem to have some bricks &amp; mortar deals arranged already and it&#8217;s only 48 hour old. You are right, they&#8217;ll need marketing, but am sure it&#8217;s coming.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a better advertisement than the front page of <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>? I&#8217;m betting it shows up there for a while</p>
<p>no they won&#8217;t. it&#8217;s not even a Google made product. But accepted that they can crush anyone&#8217;s marketing by having this on their home page, if they want to.</p>
<p>Apple and Google don&#8217;t build their products either, but this is a Google BRANDED product made by Asus for them.</p>
<p>To all intent and purpose this is a Google product.</p>
<p>Dude we&#8217;ve been preparing for this for years now, it&#8217;s getting kinda boring.</p>
<p>Hmm sorta on the ropes about the score. While the Android tablet ecosytem is improving I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s to point where the device can capture an 8.8. Other ecosystems don&#8217;t usually get this pass. Pretty good tab though especially for the price.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the ecosystem. The lack of tablet apps is a myth. The number of Android apps that are designed for tablets is huge.</p>
<p>I think 7&quot; is the size where both phone and tablet apps could work.</p>
<p>a dual panel for productivity apps like email, even though everything are too smushed and busy, it works. phone app like twitter, content a bit sparse, but it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s why google went with a 7&quot;er. It&#8217;s the 16:10 aspect ratio that makes me curious, I hate 16:9 including computer screens.</p>
<p>This write-up says otherwise.</p>
<p>The &#8220;lack of tablet apps&#8221; on Android is a bit overstated.  The Twitter app is always thrown out there but no one ever mentions the alternatives that <em>are</em> optimised for tablets (e.g. TweetCaster, Plume).</p>
<p>That said, the situation still needs to improve.  Between the Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, there&#8217;s no excuse for developers not to optimize for tablets now.</p>
<p>The Twitter app is just one example, but it&#8217;s an important one. If you ask people about the things that people actually want to do on a tablet, they want simple things. Nobody cares about hundreds of thousands of apps; they want to read, browse the internet, check Facebook and Twitter, and they maybe want to play games. This tablet will do all those things, but the Facebook and Twitter apps suck, and iOS has better games. So, it&#8217;s really only good at 2 out of the 5 things that people actually want to do.</p>
<p>In games you can&#8217;t say it doesn&#8217;t have good games, particularly cos of it&#8217;s Tegra Chipset.</p>
<p>Chipset doesn&#8217;t matter if it has to run the phone app version.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called the Tegrazone, you should check it out sometime.</p>
<p>Seriously why should I have to? This is the problem. Only tech readers even know about this tablet. Even less know that the tablet area of google play has improved, and even less care. Apple puts out high quality apps all the time for each device. You shouldn&#8217;t have to hunt and seArch for the good ones. They should be front and center, like on the amazon app store.</p>
<p>Android hasn&#8217;t had an OS worthy of developing tablet apps for. You people, yes you people, keep dogging it as if the ecosystem will remain stagnant.</p>
<p>Everything changes, even your beloved iOS and iDevices.</p>
<p>My point is amazon was smart enough to add some quality control. They made it easy like apple. Google hasn&#8217;t even tried, it seems.</p>
<p>As a dev I can tell you it is not that there aren&#8217;t any &#8220;worthy&#8221; tablets, the problem is discovery.</p>
<p>Those with tablets will never find your tablet optimized app, making it not worth the effort. If google had some kind of &#8220;tablet optimized&#8221; designator than adoption would increase, I guarantee it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s missing the point a little bit. I shouldn&#8217;t be able to download an app on a device it wasn&#8217;t made for. I know you can open iPhone apps on the iPad, but by not trying to make the apps work and rather just scaling them in a weird looking way, Apple kind of shamed devs into updating for the new size quickly. In contrast Google made sure devs supported multiple <em>phone</em> sizes from the beginning, so when tablets started arriving the the designs technically worked, nobody seemed to bother making them work better.</p>
<p>The Android Tablet app system is a bit weird.  There are apps that have technically been updated for a tablet that sucked, like Google+ before the update, but then there are apps that work perfectly even when they&#8217;re not updated, too.  The bottom line is that you can&#8217;t just search &#8220;tablet&#8221; on the Play Store and get all the good apps.</p>
<p>Supporting multiple screen sizes and densities is a real pain. Even though they&#8217;ve got it pretty standardized the emulation just isn&#8217;t good enough, and it feels like there&#8217;s a huge hidden expense there. You really can&#8217;t get a good look of how somethings going to feel without having the device in your hand. Buying all those devices with modernish components and standard screens is almost looking like a necessity. It&#8217;s just not good enough not have something you can feel as a frame of reference.</p>
<p>Our designers also hate it.</p>
<p>When we do iOS apps the designers give the programmers pixel perfect comps of how they want the UI to look, how they want it to move. Their vision gets recreated exactly.</p>
<p>Then when we do Android apps, the most common thing that happens is the iOS design is jammed into the Android system (usually due to client budget constraints). However on the rare occasion we&#8217;ve had more time to spend, the programmers are happy to create flexible layouts, but the designers lament their loss over exact placement, having to use tile-able textures, (and probably until now, lack of something as good as Core Animation on iOS).</p>
<p>Also the HiDPI thing on Android is handled atrociously — they have a lot more DPIs to support, to be fair. But the simplicity of iOS&#8217; automated @2x system is just so easy. We have scripts that we run over our asset folder to generate all the retina and non-retina content. With Android dev that&#8217;s a lot harder due to some of the whacky middle-range DPIs and requirements for everything to be resizable.</p>
<p>quite simply put building an android app is more like building a pc app rather than a dos app supporting only 320&#215;200 and 640&#215;480.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s harder for the designers, sure. but it&#8217;s a lot more future proof.</p>
<p>I understand and value that aspect of it. But so far I have not really seen it done well on Android — I haven&#8217;t seen apps equivalent to some of the most beautiful and usable on iOS. When you let designers have their way, sometimes they make really great things.</p>
<p>Also I question the usefulness of &#8220;future proofing&#8221; apps that are generally priced from $1 to $10 (or mostly free, as is the case on Android). Apple has shown time and time again that they can make their developers jump through hoops. Introduce a new resolution? Every developer is on it immediately, updating to the new system.</p>
<p>I agree with your point when it comes to PC apps. But for devices like the iPad, as a developer, I would be happy to re-write or re-build my app when a brand new Apple device is released (every few years, say). Because it leads to more sales, and forces me to keep my customers happy.</p>
<p>Coding and programming is not sacred — we don&#8217;t have to future proof it and keep it around. Throwing stuff out and starting from scratch can sometimes be the best thing you ever do for your products.</p>
<p>The real problem is that Twitter doesn&#8217;t feel that the Android tablet platform is important enough to optimize their own app. Same with Facebook and Flipboard. If they would bother, why should smaller developers?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t think that Android get smartphone apps is out of the goodness of developers hearts. Supporting an app costs time and money whereas doing nothing does not.</p>
<p>I find the iPad version of Facebook to be as useful as Facebook on any Android tablet.  Sure, it may be a little prettier, but aside from that, I don&#8217;t see any benefit.</p>
<p>But&#8230;but&#8230;but&#8230;it&#8217;s not tablet specific! OMG!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tablet optimized.</p>
<p>It takes a very long time to develop an app let alone retrofit it to add functionality, and much like anything else in Android learning how to do things for tablets is time-consuming commitment. Even though I think the Nexus 7 looks promising is spending three months just learning tablet functionality a good use of time? Unless you&#8217;re designing from ground up you&#8217;re almost certainly going to be introducing new bugs you don&#8217;t know how to fix.</p>
<p>Not to mention the word &#8216;developer&#8217; is consistently misused. It&#8217;s like when people talk about OEMs without knowing what they are. On android you&#8217;ve got companies with product teams adding to their service with apps, you got solo guys who develop for search results, there&#8217;s studios producing and managing projects for clients, and there&#8217;s also solo guys who offer a service and are their own product team. That&#8217;s a lot of different scenarios you got to account for. It&#8217;s shit, although most people and companies aren&#8217;t going to add a feature unless it pays them handsomely.</p>
<p>The main problem is finding the apps. They exist, but it&#8217;s hard to see which ones are designed for tablets. And a phone UI just doesn&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>Guess that is where we disagree.  I think the phone UI cuts it in most situations.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even close to 250,000 huge.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t apps, it&#8217;s discovery of them.</p>
<p>There are 600,000 Apps available. Only a few are optimized for tablets, but all the phone-centric Apps work perfectly fine, a lot better than iPhone-Apps on an iPad, even more so on a 7&quot; tablet.</p>
<p>Except for I&#8217;ve never had to use an iPhone app for the iPad. The stuff I wanna use on a tab;let always has a native version. Which thank god that&#8217;s not an issue since the iPad is now at 2048 &#215; 1536. But I disagree that they look fine on the tablet. Do they work? sure&#8230;. but they are far inferior than a native tablet app most of the time.</p>
<p>Eh I just got an iPad and I was shocked to run into apps that are only available to the iPhone. The experience is similar on both platforms, except Apple makes a huge deal out of it and screams THIS IS NOT A TABLET APP and for me that makes my experience much worse than just scaling like Android. It feels as if I&#8217;m not even supposed to use the app at all on iOS.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s to encourage developers to update their apps. It&#8217;s what Google should be doing, too.</p>
<p>Except the way you build apps for iOS and Android is drastically different. On both accounts devs are either being lazy or don&#8217;t have the time/funding. One companies approach is to make my end experience not so hot, the others is to make it tolerable. Usually Apple is out for the consumer, but I feel in this scenario it&#8217;s reverse.</p>
<p>Such as? I have over one hundred apps on my iPad. Only one is not a universal or iPad only, and it is a specific todo list app.</p>
<p>I mean cool story for you and your apps, but my experience is different. There are certainly more tablet specific apps in iOS, but some big ones like Tumblr seem to come to mind. I don&#8217;t download them all, just stumble across them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing you didn&#8217;t use Spotify till about 3 months ago?<br />
Facebook only released their iPad app last year&#8230;</p>
<p>sure if you count skinds, widgets, lock screens, launchers as apps. I don&#8217;t see any quality, amazing apps on Android. Most are just ported from iOS and look rediculous in Android UI.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&#8217;t want fine apps, they want the best apps. Thats why android will never be as good as iOS. They really don&#8217;t care to be the best.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve preordered one because it looks cool to play around with, but I&#8217;d agree with you. 8.8 seems way too high. Clearly it&#8217;s not time to stop giving Google a pass.</p>
<p>Apparently an &#8220;incredible lack of developer support.&#8221; still nets you a 7/10 for ecosystem.</p>
<p>Windows phone, which has an ecosystem where MSFT is being forced to write apps for big companies in house because those companies have no interest in developing for windows phone, also got a 7. And then people complained it was too low.</p>
<p>Are you telling me that you honestly feel that the ecosystem for a 7&quot; android tablet is worse? Bearing in mind if you watched the video you should notice that phone apps work remarkably well due to the smaller gap between 7 inches and 5 inches.</p>
<blockquote>Are you telling me that you honestly feel that the ecosystem for a 7&quot; android tablet is worse? </blockquote>
<p>What? Not at all. Josh was 100% correct in his assessment of the WP7 situation and obviously Android tablets aren&#8217;t <strong>as</strong> bad.</p>
<p>But when a paragraph is dedicated to app support or the lack thereof and features the words &#8220;suffers from an incredible lack of developer support&#8221;, &#8220;mainstream apps &#8230; have yet to be updated to an appropriate tablet-friendly design&#8221;, &#8220;not working 100% correctly&#8221;, &#8220;aren&#8217;t optimized for the tablet in any way&#8221;, &#8220;.hopefully that&#8217;ll be changing soon&#8221;, and &#8220;A problem Gogole needs to tackle&#8221;, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be expecting a 7/10 for ecosystem and 8.8 overall.</p>
<p>ICS and Jelly Bean are very, very good OSes, but it&#8217;s been 18 months since Android hit tablets, and mainstream apps like Twitter still don&#8217;t have an acceptable tablet layout.</p>
<p>Is the app situation as dire as WP7? Or the Blackberry/Playbook? Or WebOS? Of course not. Can you run phone apps just fine? Absolutely. But Josh is still giving Google a pass when it comes to the app ecosystem &#8212; something that will be very important particularly in non-US countries where Google Play doesn&#8217;t offer the the same breadth of content as it does in the US.</p>
<p>Windows phone got a 7 for ecosystem, this got a 7 for ecosystem. If you think this score should be lower what you are saying is you feel that the android ecosystem is comparatively weaker than windows phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we can critique the overall score until we actually use the product, saying the review is wrong when you haven&#8217;t even seen the tablet for yourself is stupid. When deciding if you can trust a reviewer, be IRA movie reviewer or a tech reviewer find some products you are familiar with and read their reviews on those products that you know well and see if you agree. If you agree then you can trust the reviews on the products that you haven&#8217;t used by that same person. I have done that for Josh so I personally trust his scores.</p>
<p>The ecosystem and software are the only things we can talk about. The tablet app selection is poor but the phone selection is decent and phone apps work very well on his particular form factor. I think a 7 is reasonable, especially when you compare it windows phone which you have to do with reviews. It does not deserve worse than windows phone in my opinion.</p>
<p>Windows phone got a 4 for ecosystem, and there are hardly any GOOD android tablet apps available. I think its fair to say that ecosystem should be lower, you are reviewing a tablet after all, not a phone. (I still pre-ordered this to play around with though)</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t the point that Apple essentially force you to target iPhone and iPad seperately but combine it into a Universal Binary, whereas Google have an API add-on called Fragments that tries to do the work in a fuzzy way?</p>
<p>If the API is used, you don&#8217;t need to target an Android tablet, it just works.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how it works to be honest (yet), but i&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s like screensize &amp; platform targeting in CSS.</p>
<p>You do sort of need to target tablets (whether to start a new screen or place it on the same screen), but its not too difficult to get a basic master/detail set up</p>
<p>Because just about every phone app scales up and typically gives you more information on the screen then it would on a smaller screen.  So, right off the bat, you are benefiting from the larger screen.  So while Apple does have a lot of tablet apps, many of them are probably just manually scaled up versions of their phone apps.</p>
<p>For example, the new Podcast app from Apple.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/7sme4ul" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/7sme4ul</a> .  The tablet optimized version is just a manually scaled up phone version.</p>
<p>Yeah but then take a look at something like iPhoto, Keynote (or any of the iWork apps). The UI is <em>completely</em> overhauled for the phone size. And it needs to be —</p>
<p>A Podcast app doesn&#8217;t need much special treatment, because you consume with it. It just needs to show pretty pictures and let you choose a cast.</p>
<p>But their productivity apps have an amazing amount of thought put into both the phone and tablet versions. They are <em>entirely different</em> in their designs, yet still meet the same goals.</p>
<p>when you say other eco system, you mean ios? Cause there is no other eco systems for tablets&#8230; WP/RIM etc are all dead in this space!</p>
<p>WP = Windows Phone? That&#8217;s for phones.</p>
<p>Windows RT is for tablets. Kinda hard to ignore.</p>
<p>HP is going to ignore it &#8230;</p>
<p>Good for them. Their hardware was cheap shit even at high-end, and even then most of them looked like Apple ripoffs.</p>
<p>Also, have you seen the Touchpad?</p>
<p>(PalmOS is no issue, the hardware is.)</p>
<p>WTF is RT? Is this another Windowz XP crap?</p>
<p>I think I just shat my pants.</p>
<p>Well, at least it won&#8217;t get 400,000 viruses.<br />
Poor Compy.</p>
<p>This is how I felt when Sergey Brin took the stage. <br />
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ifkZVqobqag/T-3HqebQRrI/AAAAAAAAMC4/EJsw-S80vck/s700/12.jpg" /></p>
<p>i stole this&#8230;just letting you know this&#8230;haha</p>
<p>haha, the one on the right is far more cheesier than on the left. At least the one on the left had a working piece on technology, not some plastic gimmick, even though it was a movie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong Bad, did you get a virus?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes&#8230; very yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a Tablet with no apps. Nice!</p>
<p>:S</p>
<p>no apps? really?   nice try&#8230;.</p>
<p>Lets not forgot that this is a pure Google Tablet that will get upgrades and love directly from Google. The main reason i want it…It is a NEXUS! That’s it, pure and simple. Love the price, love android, and of course the Google ecosystem. I’m ordering 2 of them.</p>
<p>I feel like the scoring system means little since the average is 7.75, not 8.8&#8230;why even bother?</p>
<p>This tablet is going to kick Kindle Fire out of the market. Anyways help me out in making my blog better, donate on this link please <a href="http://igg.me/p/134639?a=751826" target="_blank">http://igg.me/p/134639?a=751826</a></p>
<p>I want one.</p>
<p>At this price, I think I can justify getting one for myself AND a few family members.</p>
<p>play.google.com</p>
<p>it is not that easy if you live in Europe&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;.it is with American friends :D</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for this&#8230;. can&#8217;t afford an iPad but this gives me all the power of the iPad, more portable form factor and still a HD screen for 2/5ths of the price!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still lacking in the app department, so a full iPad replacement it is not.</p>
<p>Considering the only apps I use are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and a few games which are already on my Samsung Galaxy Tab anyway, I&#8217;m sure I could get Shadowgun and more on this tablet. I already have an iPhone so I can still use both app ecosystems. Doesn&#8217;t need to be a full iPad replacement anyway, it is $300 cheaper!</p>
<p>Agree. However, what I feel is so awesome about the iPad is that I can leave my laptop at home a lot of the time. I&#8217;m yet to see a 7&quot; tablet that changes my mind about them, but for the price&#8230;.I&#8217;m seriously considering this one. The review and the price help it a lot.</p>
<p>With this device and a VNC app, do you think you could leave your laptop at home?</p>
<p>You might find that 7 inches is better after you get used to it. Using 7 inch talents before I hated it at first but then felt the size was a sweet spot because you can fit it in a big pocket, it fits in one hand etc. it&#8217;s perfect for reading books and watching movies.</p>
<p>I envy you though, the iPad has never been ale to be a laptop replacement for me. The better web browsing experience often isn&#8217;t enough to convince me to take it with me very often. My phone does the trick, i bring it with me if I am going on a trip but it&#8217;s not a daily thing for me. That&#8217;s why I am excited by the Surface, I feel that could honestly be a laptop replacement, meaning you can be productive on it.</p>
<p>you summarized my thinking perfectly</p>
<p>Exactly. Right now it feels like the sweet spot is to own a laptop and a 7&quot; tablet. 10 inches right now feels like a s trange compromise between the two. 10&quot; tablets need to come closer to being laptop replacements if they want to stay relevant.</p>
<p>Hehe.</p>
<p>For me, right now it feels like the sweet spot is to own a small smartphone and a 10&quot; tablet.  7&quot; right now feels like a strange compromise between the two&#8230; ;)</p>
<p>I suppose thats why they all exist!</p>
<p>Well I would agree with you if the 10&quot; device was a surface because then it matters but for me the extra 3 inches on the ipad is a lot of inconvience for not a lot of gain. Books and magazines and movies look better on the 7 inch form factor in my opinion and thats what these devices are all about. If we are talking typing a document etc then yeah I can definitely see 10 inches being important but the iPad can&#8217;t do that (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says, I am a student, I seriously tried, it doesn&#8217;t work.)</p>
<p>You think magazines look better on a 7 inch than a 10 inch?  I&#8217;m not sure I understand why, but as CTRLALT said, that&#8217;s why they all exist.</p>
<p>For me, right now it feels like the sweet spot is to own a big smartphone and a laptop.</p>
<p>I really doubt a 7&quot; screen will be that much useful  than a 4.7&quot; screen. Especially since I can do pretty much everything that I would do on a 10&quot; tablet already on my GNex.</p>
<p>I find I prefer actual web browsing on my iPad but I prefer certain websites on my other devices (primarily Youtube on OS X/ Linux &gt; iPad) but for watching my subscriptions it&#8217;s pretty good. I wish they&#8217;d overhaul the Youtube app on iOS to make it sooo much better, I think I could use the iPad more.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t need to envy, I said, most of the time. The Surface&#8230;well&#8230;that&#8217;s a whole other subject. Let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;ll wait about a year before getting a Metro product. I have no idea about their ARM vs. Intel, Metro Apps, etc. There&#8217;re so many unanswered questions, that only time will tell. Just one man&#8217;s opinion though.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s all you use then there are probably better things you could spend $200 on.</p>
<p>No offense, but $200 is pretty  much impulse buy category.</p>
<p>Like 1/2 of an iPad 2? or 2/5 of an iPad 3rd generation?</p>
<p>Not only do you have most games, i love android tablets because you don&#8217;t have to buy the same app twice. <br />
A lot of people don&#8217;t think of this when they say &#8220;no tablet apps!!!!&#8221;. This is actually better. You&#8217;re not paying twice for a tablet and a smartphone app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve purchased lots of high end games for my smartphone like GTA and they work great on the tablet. No need to pay for a tablet version.</p>
<p>For a significant (and growing) number of iOS apps, this is not an issue either.  Many apps are universal, and include both a phone-optimized AND a tablet-optimized version for one price.</p>
<p>further fragmentation of Android OS.</p>
<p>what app  is it lacking that you want?</p>
<p>Nexus 7 is far better than iPad in every way except for the lack of Game Center and the resolution isn&#8217;t as good.</p>
<p>Ok, the fanboi in you is showing. We all know this isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m curious &#8211; what&#8217;s Google Play like outside of the US? In Australia it&#8217;s pretty bare &#8211; no TV shows, no Music, Movie rentals only.</p>
<p>here in the Netherlands, we only have apps&#8230;</p>
<p>Here in Brazil, we only have access to Apps too.</p>
<p>I guess you need to come to America! We have compulsory health insurance! &quot;&quot;Give me your tired, your poor,<br />
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free and watch Tv on a Nexus tablet&quot;<br />
(apologies to Emma Lazarus)</p>
<p>Most western countries have a state medical system so your taxes are higher but you are gaurunteed coverage or compulsory health insurance and have had for a long long time because their governments actually look out for their citizens and their electorates are smart enough not to critise the government for something that is clearly better for them.</p>
<p>Now talk tech, this is a tech blog.</p>
<p>Singapore, Hong Kong and Switzerland have such low taxes most americans can&#8217;t even imagine it, yet, they all have universal coverage (and in switzerland you don&#8217;t have a state owned health system). Not only that, but Singapore spends 1/4 per capita of what the US spends in health.</p>
<p>Just making a joke, mon frere. Easy does it on the lecturing!</p>
<p>Apps only in Sweden too. I think the only countries that have <em>anything</em> beyond apps are the English-speaking ones, with US being the only one having everything.</p>
<p>Outside America, most of the countries only have apps.</p>
<p>In France we have already the movies and books should come soon, too</p>
<p>in italy we have apps and books, but rumor is that movies are coming pretty soon..</p>
<p>I think outside US they&#8217;re still working out licensing deals.</p>
<p>We get Books and Movies in the UK, although Goolge really seems to be pushing Google Play with dedicated devices such as the Q. I think one reason the Q is US only for the time being is that most of the world has limited Play content. I would guess, and hope, that Google will be planning on expanding Play across other countries in the not too distant future and get Android in homes across the world.</p>
<p>Overpriced books and movies :(</p>
<p>Movies and Books are no different in price to iTunes. Granted Kindle is cheaper but Amazon subsidises quite a few of the books. Play Books just needs more content here!</p>
<p>Really? I find that books in the Play store are usually less expensive than their Kindle counterparts.</p>
<p> Not really googles call, it&#8217;s the publishing houses etc. I am sure google is doing their upmost to try and get it expanded but the houses are resistant. Even apples selection isn&#8217;t complete outside the US, it&#8217;s annoying</p>
<p>Also maybe the movie studios and publishers aren&#8217;t big monoliths like here in the States and you have to cut deals with each individual company.</p>
<p>In the UK, we have movies, apps, and books. I&#8217;m using Google Music as I type this, but that&#8217;s only because I used a proxy to get an invite when it was still in beta. I can&#8217;t buy anything from Google Play yet, music wise.</p>
<p>Hoping we get magazine stuff soon. Pumped about that; hope Engadget put their <em>Distro </em>on there. Only thing I like about Engadget.</p>
<p>Or you could just, you know, download the Distro app.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a magazine. Why not put it in the magazines section of Google Play?</p>
<p>From the demo magazines looked identical to paper magazines. Distro is different, it&#8217;s an interactive magazine style app which admittedly is what magazines on a tablet should be but judging by the examples the shown that&#8217;s not what magazines are to them. To them magazines were static pictures that you could zoom in and out of.</p>
<p>Here in the pihlippines, only Apps are currently available.<br />
I went to the nexus 7 page yesterday only to be met with a Not yet available in your country page.</p>
<p>I really hope Google delivers this internationally as it is an automatic sell for people in the know, and at the current price range, it will shit bricks, literally.</p>
<p>Considering the track record of Nexus devices, I don&#8217;t see why Nexus 7 won&#8217;t be available  in a broader range of countries. Only issue, however, is the availability of content. :/</p>
<p>Just move in to the states. :)</p>
<p>How is that helpful? Seriously why do you feel the need to waste your time with such a pointless reply? I live in Australia, should I sell my hundreds of thousands of non-existent assets  and move to &#8220;the greatest country on earth&#8221; (it&#8217;s not) just for better choice of content from one of several services. Grow up.</p>
<p>I know video games are much more expensive in Australia, how about apps? do you know if you get charged more for them also? <br />
PS. Us Americans can be silly please don&#8217;t hold it against us.</p>
<p>So, what you are saying is that not only do you not get TV Shows and Music from Google Play, but you a;so don&#8217;t get jokes.</p>
<p>Oh so sorry, I didn&#8217;t realise that you knew RangersK personally and you can speak with such authority when confidently justifying his unhelpful suggestion as a joke.</p>
<p>When someone complains about the state of such services in their country, you don&#8217;t just mock them with implausible solutions and let other people justify said comment as a joke.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure he was kidding&#8230; I don&#8217;t think you were looking for that kind of level of advice from this comment section right?</p>
<p>in Germany we get Apps &amp; Books<br />
and my Xoom got 4.04 today &#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s not like there are any hardware differences between The US Wifi version an the EMEA version &#8230;<br />
sorry for the rant</p>
<p>I really hope this makes a big dent in the tablet market. In my opinion, this is the only Android tablet that is worth my money (and it is so cheap!). I really want this to push Apple with competition.</p>
<p>The new Asus Transformer Infinity is also a option that seems to be very interesting &#8211; more expensive, but also bigger and with a lot of interesting features (like the usual keyboard dock)</p>
<p>I love both of those tablets, but I&#8217;m going to hold on to my AOKP Touchpad another month or two to see if Samsung announces an Exynos 5 powered Galaxy Tab.</p>
<p>I think this is a huge win for Google. More powerful than the iPad, but still smaller and way cheaper!</p>
<p>Smaller is an objective fact. Cheaper is an objective fact.</p>
<p>More powerful. Hmmm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s close enough really. When you account for the massive resolution of the iPad, this easily keeps up with it (and outperforms it in some ways).</p>
<p>It is barely more powerful in processing power (which iOS needs very little of), but Anand tested the new iPad and its graphics were about 3.7 times better than Nvidia&#8217;s Tegra 3. In real world benchmarks including the display, the iPad performed graphically about twice as well. So it is not really close.</p>
<p>You are missing the point.  The new iPad also has 2-3 times more pixels to push.</p>
<p>Maybe you should read his comment again.</p>
<p>Oh, it wasn&#8217;t clear.  He said Anand tested the Tegra 3, not that he tested the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>The 3rd gen iPad is horribly under powered for creative apps.  Try using sketchbook ink, art rage etc. they are barely usable.</p>
<p>See, this is a better discussion.  What does &#8220;more powerful&#8221; even mean without respect to particular functions?</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s less usable for that type of content creation &#8211; a struggling processor or a smaller screen? I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a clear cut answer to that question.</p>
<p>Can I also point out that one of the reasons those art apps are so frustrating is the lag in the capacitive screen. As far as we know, that hasn&#8217;t improved here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue the inaccuracies of the screen, coupled with the severe lag in rendering makes it entirely useless for the effort. Meanwhile a smaller screen with less lag, or even lower res may be useful. I can&#8217;t say if the Nexus 7 is &#8220;more&#8221; powerful until I try it. But I was surprised at how poor the performance of the &#8220;best in class&#8221; tablet was.  If you charge a premium make certain you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Entirely useless? I&#8217;m not sure the extremist language is fair. Isn&#8217;t it enough to say that you find it useless?</p>
<p>I repeat: I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a clear cut answer to this question. Different people are going to value different things from their experience, which will mean that some will <em>prefer</em> the iPad and some people will <em>prefer</em> the Nexus 7. Is it possible for you to concur with that?</p>
<p>it definitely is not &#8220;more powerful&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really good device (maybe even &#8216;iPad class&#8217;&#8230; that&#8217;s up for debate), but comments like that make my head hurt.</p>
<p>The review does lead the reader to believe it&#8217;s just as powerful. I don&#8217;t agree, but that&#8217;s the spin of the review.</p>
<p>Perhaps more powerful than the iPad 2 you could argue.  Not the new one&#8217;s GPU however.</p>
<p>A consideration is that it should need about 1/2 the GPU power for the same performance, just because it&#8217;s driving so many fewer pixels. The comparison is kind of moot though &#8211; so long as performance is roughly in parity, no consumer cares about power.</p>
<p>it&#8217;ll be great for people who don&#8217;t need much out of their tablet, and hopefully this helps drive the surfaces arm version price down, but I&#8217;s still chose the iPad for the screen alone. My iPad continues to bum me out that 16000 monitors are still like a grand.</p>
<p>Great review. Looks like Google have finally nailed it. Solid performance, portability, features and most importantly, <strong>price</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking forward to this.</p>
<p>Yeah I wish had this instead of my Fire.</p>
<p>To Ebay!</p>
<p>*eBay</p>
<p>Amazon Video on Google Play and I&#8217;m buying one.</p>
<p>someone pulled the APK from the fire but supposedly on works at the Fire&#8217;s resolution. Also no streaming over 3G</p>
<p>Google Play is crappy in Australia, but if Google eventually improves that, this could be interesting. I only want a tablet for magazines (WIRED, and some AU ones), occasional movies and music and web browsing, like The Verge. This tablet sounds great for US people, but the iPad still kills it and, as a content consumption device, that&#8217;s fatal.</p>
<p>Definitely agreed here. I jumped on the AU Play Store went &#8220;Really? That&#8217;s it?&#8221; with such limited storage it&#8217;s a bit of a tough sell if that&#8217;s all we have access to.</p>
<p>Surely Google can open the Magazine store here and allow submissions. Even if it&#8217;s slim pickings, at least give us something rather than no magazines at all.</p>
<p>You have access to anything you want to put on the tablet. That USB port is there for a reason.</p>
<p>8/16GB is nowhere near enough. And sticking an external HDD in (Assuming it supports that?) kind of defeats the purpose.</p>
<p>External HDD, yes. SD/MicroSD, feasible with a USB OTG cable and a card reader.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not ideal, but given how the latency of dealing with external storage has historically been a failing of performance with Android, you can see why they&#8217;ve done it.</p>
<p>Streaming would still be nicer and, as usual, Google has been taking it&#8217;s time going global. Not even the UK has Music.</p>
<blockquote>Google has been taking it’s time going global. </blockquote> <p>That&#8217;s because there are &#8220;1 million&#8221; separate copyright holders. This is more a problem with international copyright law than Google&#8217;s unwillingness to roll it out.</p>
<p>They have to make sure it&#8217;s profitable before incurring the cost of expanding it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also located in Australia and while it would be nice to have a better offering with Play, the fact that you can just dump any old media file on the Android tab and it will play is a big deal to me.</p>
<p>This might not make getting new content as easy as the iPad, but if you already have a whole lot of content in differing formats this has got the iPad beat.</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s just my opinion.</p>
<p>Stop ur whinging, try NZ&#8230; oh wait, no google play, therefore, no damn Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Android is looking very tasty now and this is coming from an Apple fanboy</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t go that far &#8211; this device is certainly looking very tasty, especially compared to the absolute RUBBISH most Android OEMs are pumping out.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing what this year&#8217;s Nexus is like!</p>
<p>Agree. Feels like the hardware and software were meant for each other.</p>
<p>At this price, why choose? Get both!</p>
<p>Now if only the stupid developers would make apps for it!</p>
<p>Calling them stupid helps your argument. Especially when the smart money is developing for the iPad.</p>
<p>Which app are you actually missing?</p>
<p>When did you last check? A year ago perhaps?</p>
<p>Looks like I&#8217;m finally getting a tablet! Great review as always.</p>
<p>Ok, this DOES make up for the lack of a Vergecast tonight. This was a great review! I wonder though, will Emoji work cross-platform now? I would like to send my android friends police car icons and the like. That would be nice.</p>
<p>Thanks for the late-night review Josh!</p>
<p>Well, if your friends have a messaging app like Go SMS, you already can. But to answer your question, yes.</p>
<p>This has the potential to become ubiquitous at this price tag, watch out Kindle, watch out ipad&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, but only if they advertise it.</p>
<p> I think this will sell like hotcakes if they can make it in enough numbers, every cat, dog and biped is gonna have one&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sad that they&#8217;re not making a model for spiders.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t someone think of the arachnids?</p>
<p>Thats what third parties are for&#8230;.</p>
<p>Wonder when will it get launched in Asian markets.</p>
<p>Google Now is great right now, but I think it would be so much more useful on a device with a data connection, like a smartphone. With a persistent connection, Now will know where you are on a commute to help you navigate and will better be able to know where you are. When I have this on my smartphone, I think it will be great!</p>
<p>Exactly what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Im using Google Now on my Nexus right now. And it works amazingly well. The way it predicts some of your patterns is freaky..</p>
<p>Great. Now the government is going to sue google for knowing too much.</p>
<p>$199 is not equal to £159.  I want one (even though I have an ipad3), but why do people in the UK always have to pay a premium?</p>
<p>The first price I came across for this tablet in Finland was 449€.. <strong>sigh</strong></p>
<p>Because the UK imposes extra tariffs on technology items. Blame your politicians.</p>
<p>Because of VAT, amongst other things. At 20%, and assuming googles conversion to £, that puts it in for us at about £153, and thats not including other taxes payed by Google which would push up that extra £6</p>
<p>It is not really too much of a premium and not one I am complaining about. Although my Bank account is now&#8230;where did that £199 go?</p>
<p>This is a really, a truly excellent bit of kit. Can you imagine what it is going to be like when Tesco start churning these out? Based on Tesco&#8217;s recent grab as a content provider, they have the potential to get behind something like this and all they need is a confirmation that the Tesco Digital store is pre-installed. Or even offer a small credit for it. I can picture millions of these being marched out of superstores across the UK up to Christmas.</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t get Tesco Digital pre-installed, its a Nexus. But yeah, giving away a voucher would be a very good idea.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure they are equivalent when you consider all of the tax you pay (and the fact that tax isn&#8217;t included in the $199)</p>
<p>£159 for this is still a good deal &#8211; even more so considering how many companies would have just swapped the $ for a £.<br />
Google just did the tablet competitor how it needs to be done &#8211; regardless of how good the product is (personally, I think this is being sold as being something less than it really is), there needs to be a concession to the fact that there are plenty of people that refer to any tablet as an &#8216;iPad&#8217;, just as vacuum cleaners get called &#8216;Hoovers&#8217;.</p>
<p>Ebuyer are doing the 16GB model for £199 inc. VAT &amp; delivered.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s cheaper than Google will sell it once tax &amp; shipping are applied, as it works out as ~£193 once taxed &amp; converted before shipping.</p>
<p>But Ebuyer probably will not offer the £15 Play credit will they? So that means buying direct is still the best value for the moment. Even QuidCo won&#8217;t offer a better deal&#8230;</p>
<p>That $199 is before tax. Remember it&#8217;s after the sale for some reason in the US.</p>
<p>Yup&#8230; because sales tax rates vary from state to state.  Within each state, sales tax varies from city to city.  If you are not in the city (rural), then your sales tax is usually even less.</p>
<p>So no site displays prices with tax in the US (but it is not uncommon to show the sales tax AFTER you put in your shipping information).</p>
<p>Some online retailers, Amazon comes to mind, will try to find loopholes in sales tax laws to not charge you tax at all (except in states where there is an Amazon wharehouse).</p>
<p>*warehouse</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&#8217;s the reason. What a shame you don&#8217;t have the same tax rate across the country.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happens when you have things like regional differences in a large country. Some people don&#8217;t want many local services and some people do, and the taxing flexibility allows the country to have a variety (also creates huge problems in some areas close to boundaries).</p>
<p>So have Google done away with the whole tablet UI found on all the other Android tablets?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still there for 10&quot; devices &#8211; seems 7&quot; devices use this now.</p>
<p>Yep, still on 10&quot; devices.</p>
<p>Or is it going away in Jellybean? (not sure)</p>
<p>Nope, it&#8217;ll still be there. Maybe modified, but still there.</p>

<p>Thanks Josh for convincing me to order it!</p>
<p>It looks like a genuinely good piece of hardware.  It&#8217;s too  bad Android&#8217;s tablet ecosystem is so woefully lacking.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will turn enough heads to change that.</p>
<p>This is literally the perfect tablet.  Its size is correct and it&#8217;s price is definitely correct.  Once more and more apps are optimized for this tablet, we&#8217;re going to be looking at one amazing device for an insanely low price.  Google had to start somewhere and this thing looks amazing.  I&#8217;d buy one right now if I could and I never felt like I wanted an Ipad because I didn&#8217;t feel like it was worth its price.  This looks worth its price easily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only missing app support. Kind of a big deal, depending on your perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah, because the app support will remain stagnant right? The iPad app support had to start somewhere&#8230;</p>
<p>I want one&#8230;</p>
<p>How is Flipboard on tablets like this?</p>
<p>It might be okay on a 7in tablet, but they don&#8217;t have a very good 10in experience (it&#8217;s just a blown up phone app)</p>
<p>Hardware looks good but Play really sucks and there are still not enough tablet optimized apps.</p>
<p>Play&#8217;s good in general, it&#8217;s just tablet apps are sparse right now.</p>
<p>plenty of apps for this size of device. because of the kindle fire and tab 7, ziio&#8217;s etc.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not many. Apps that use Fragments (like the app I&#8217;m helping make, Boid) look OK on tablets because they use Fragments.</p>
<p>Except we can&#8217;t get Boid on Tablets :(</p>
<p>Extract the apk (there&#8217;s loads of Chrome extensions to extract a free apk directly from the web Play Store) and use it :)</p>
<p>A tablet UI for Boid is coming very soon!</p>
<p>Was totally sold that my first tablet was going to be an iPad 3 until this was announced. Very excited!</p>
<p>When visiting The New York Times&#8230; <br />
<blockquote>Oh, that&#8217;s cute. A Nexus 7 ad. </blockquote><br />
Great review, Josh. This will most likely be my first tablet. Google has certainly stepped up to the plate.</p>
<p>yea its gonna be my first tablet too :)</p>
<p>How would media that I own get sync&#8217;d to the tablet?  Couldn&#8217;t see any mention of that in the review ( unless I&#8217;ve missed it&#8230;. ).</p>
<p>Mostly over the air. All the media apps have an option to &#8220;Pin&#8221; content which downloads them and makes them available offline. Otherwise the device will stream from the cloud. Only real exception to this is Music (if not uploaded to Google Music, so for users outside of America) &amp; Photos (although a lot can be done from the device w/ Picasa &amp; Google Plus) which are done using MTP which is a standard camera/MP3 Player USB protocol</p>
<p>Ah, that&#8217;s cool, thank you!</p>
<p>16GB isn&#8217;t much, but it&#8217;s more than enough a few movies ( and the UK store doesn&#8217;t seem to have a vast range&#8230;. ).</p>
<p>It definitely turned out to be worth waiting for. Going to get myself one for sure. Great job guys.</p>
<p>It definitely looks like a best Android tablet device to date, but is it better than iPad? Nope, Apple still has App Store/iTunes Store etc&#8230; And, do not forget that it&#8217;s 10-inch which is much better for home casual usage and it is not that big carry around&#8230; And better battery life&#8230;</p>
<p>So, if you are looking for cheap, but good device &#8594; Nexus 7. If you are looking just for the best device &#8594; iPad, even the old one.</p>
<blockquote>So, if you are looking for <strong>inexpensive as well as</strong> good device → Nexus 7</blockquote>
<p>FTFY</p>
<p>Looks good but Google removing any chance of HDMI connectivity is really cost cutting gone mad.</p>
<p>Agreed. Not even a dongle? :-/</p>
<p>Maybe we&#8217;ll see a Nexus 7+ in the future?</p>
<p>The microUSB may be HDMI. Dunno, probably not, but you never know.</p>
<p>I meant MHL. Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>slams head against desk</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping they make a Pogo dock for this that has full size USB and HDMI. MHL is fine if you&#8217;re just going to hook it up to a TV, but I want to connect a USB wireless mouse and keyboard at the same time, and as far as I know MHL can&#8217;t do HDMI and USB host at the same time.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not MHL, Engadget confirmed it on their review. They said there&#8217;s no way of getting HDMI.</p>
<p>Unless you buy a Q. . .</p>
<p>but even that doesn&#8217;t screen cast&#8230; sigh.</p>
<p>Yep.. I&#8217;m really confused by this, especially because the original Asus tablet this was based on had mini HDMI, so it should be a matter of a $0.05 connector.</p>
<p>Yep.. I&#8217;m really confused by this, especially because the original Asus tablet this was based on had mini HDMI, so it should be a matter of a $0.05 connector.We&#8217;ll probably even see the solder pads in the circuit board once someone does a teardown.</p>

<p>Oops not sure what happened there..</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s undoubtedly the best 7&quot; tablet and quite possibly the best Android tablet, I did find it that hilarious that Josh shifted up the score by a full point. The scores average out to 7.75, and that&#8217;s with a very generous ecosystem rating.</p>
<p>i doubt &#8220;camera&#8221; for a tablet is weighted as heavily as &#8220;softwre&#8221;</p>
<p>Bottom line is Josh has clearly exercised his power in the final score. While this is a very compelling device, I worry that the adjustment may not stay true in the long run. 8.8 is a seriously high score for any product, and a score not reached by any flagship Android device this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;More times than not, the Verge score is based on the average of the subscores below. However, since this is a non-weighted average, we reserve the right to tweak the overall score if we feel it doesn&#8217;t reflect our overall assessment and price of the product.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you said, Josh obviously decided that the average was not an accurate reflection of his experiences, and the fact that the product is only 199 dollars also goes into it. On the podcasts they have been talking about how future promise also is put into account (the Lytro), and how products can be improved due to their price. What I got out of this was Josh in effect saying at this price point and with the inevitable push from Android into the tablet space, the Nexus 7 is the best option for someone looking to get into the Android space and wants prompt updates.</p>
<p>This is not a minor tweak, it&#8217;s throwing a respectable device into a highly-exclusive club of products with ~9.0 scores. As I&#8217;ve iterated elsewhere, price has commonly been ignored during reviews, receiving a footnote &#8211; many devices are in fact played down because they don&#8217;t measure up to &#8220;competitors&#8221; that are priced hundreds of dollars above the device. If someone told me a product scores a 9/10, I wouldn&#8217;t think that there are still serious questions to be asked regarding the platform and ecosystem (similarly, I didn&#8217;t expect an 8.0+ score for any Windows Phone Mango device for the same reason).</p>
<p>You got around 6000 developers who now own a nexus 7 tablet, so we are bound to see more tablet optimized apps</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really too early to say &#8211; it didn&#8217;t happen with the Galaxy 10.1.</p>
<p>The Galaxy 10.1 started with Gingerbread which is a terrible OS for a tablet, as was Honeycomb. With ICS rolling out (hopefully in a timely fashion) to more and more devices especially tablets, don&#8217;t bet on the tablet ecosystem remaining stagnant as it has.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re getting confused.  The Galaxy Tab 10.1 is the one that Google gave away a year ago to I/O attendees.  It came with Honeycomb.  The guy you&#8217;re replying to is pointing out that a large number of developers received them for free, so it clearly takes more than just giving away free tablets to developers in order to get them on board.</p>
<p>There WAS an earlier version of the tab which only had Gingerbread.  IIRC it was the only one released by a major manufacturer that used the &#8220;phone&#8221; version of the OS.</p>
<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, I think the problem with the Galaxy Tab 10.1 may have simply been that even a blind man could see that Honeycomb was rushed out as quickly as possible with little regard to whether it worked well.  What developer would want to put their support behind that?  Even ICS had a fair number of obvious oversights that JB needed to correct.  It also wasn&#8217;t a proper &#8220;Nexus&#8221; device and there was a clear sense at the time that Google was promoting it only because it was the best they could offer, not because they were satisfied with it.</p>
<p>Also &#8211; and now I&#8217;m just getting into personal opinion &#8211; I&#8217;ve never liked the 10&quot; form factor.  I&#8217;ve tried about half a dozen of them, including the iPad 2 which is the lightest one AFAIK.  But even so, they&#8217;re all too big, heavy, and awkward.  You can&#8217;t really hold it with one hand but to interact with it you need to.  The keyboard&#8217;s obnoxiously huge &#8211; thought that&#8217;s something easily rectified with Swiftkey 3&#8217;s tablet version.  It&#8217;s too big to really be portable.  In short, I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an ideal size for anything intended to be a portable device.  5 to 8 inches is more reasonable, and 7 makes a great compromise.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m disappointed the Nexus 7 doesn&#8217;t have expandable storage or HDMI output, I gave it some thought and I think the reason these are missing has nothing to do with cost cutting.  If Google included them, they would be cutting the legs out from beneath all of their OEM partners.  A tablet with every conceivable high-end feature, the lightest 7-incher so far, and being sold almost for a loss?  That would piss some people off.  How could anyone possibly compete with that?  I doubt even Samsung could beat that without taking a loss.</p>
<p>gotta minus all the ones on ebay and the ones taken home by techblogs</p>
<p>Average of scores is 7.75, but overall score is 8.8? huh? Or am I doing something wrong?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>Clearly, some are not as important as others.</p>
<p>This is a bogus assertion; looking at the breakdown of subcategories, to have the product anywhere near 8.8 would require the sparse two 9/10s to be weighted very, very heavily. The answer is that Josh adjusted the score, as he is entitled to.</p>
<p>The camera got a 6? Really?</p>
<p>And i say this because:<br />

<p>Way to go, Josh.</p>
<p>Fantastic review, as always, although as a review for an ebook reading device, I found the lack of 50 Shades of Grey reference is a little disappointing,</p>
<p>Take my money Google!  I put jelly bean on my nexus.  It&#8217;s nice. Can&#8217;t wait to use the tablet.</p>
<p>Dear google.  Let me buy, please.</p>
<p>I just got my credit card out to buy this thing, and was met with a &#8220;seller does not accept payments from your location&#8221; message. W.T.F., google? For someone who wants a piece of the tablet market, you sure are making it difficult for me to support you.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m in Zimbabwe. I&#8217;m in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. And my card is a Bank of America card.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kind of humorous that you can&#8217;t buy a product intended for the US with a &#8220;Bank of America&#8221; card. (granted, you aren&#8217;t here, but still&#8230; I think you can see what I am getting at)</p>
<p>Yeah. At first I figured it was a problem with my local bank&#8217;s card. (Newegg won&#8217;t accept my international Visa, for example). I then tried my all-american card. No dice.</p>
<p>Google has been really problematic for us Puertorricans. I can&#8217;t publish paid apps in the market, while people from a lot of other places in the world can. If the Android device is not a phone (with a U.S. network IP address) and location is enabled, we can&#8217;t buy apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=16845">Cannot purchase paid apps from market on Asus EEE Pad Transformer.</a> I opened that issue more than a year ago. Still no official answer.</p>
<p>I had the same issue yesterday when I tried to pre-oder the Nexus 7. My registered address had US as country. I edited my address so that PR was now the country and it let me pre-order without any problems. Hope this helps!</p>
<p>PS- On the google play store it clearly says PR is supported so try to change your address to see if you&#8217;re successful and keep us posted!</p>
<p>Couple of things though. The OS seems like a blown up phone version. Where is the tablet layout?<br />
Some apps are showing the tablet layout though, so that is nice. Is the Android tablet layout definitly out? <br />
Another thing? Does the homescreen/launcher support landscape layout, or is it portrait only?</p>
<p>The tablet layout is still around for larger devices, Google decided that the phone layout worked better for this. After playing with a couple 7 inch tablets in the store, I kind of agree.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s portrait only, but I&#8217;m guessing you can install another launcher if you like. Still annoying.</p>
<p>That is so stupid. Same on the Galaxy Nexus, no landscape in the launcher. Plugin a MHL dongle and BAM, there you have landscape suddenly. I really think for a tablet they should have landscape on the homescreen, even if the OS uses a blown up version of the phone layout.</p>
<p>Yeah I agree, I wish they let you choose orientations.</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus dock and I&#8217;m personally glad the launcher stays in portrait, because landscape totally wrecks the widgets.</p>
<p>Android needs a better landscape widget experience, because it&#8217;s borderline awful.</p>
<p>Custom launchers can do landscape, although the dock still stays on the left or right.</p>
<p>I am really disappointed that they didn&#8217;t use the tablet layout for the home screen. To me it looks retarded with the phone layout.</p>
<p>Nice review.</p>
<p>My only worry is how OEMs Willard carriers will screw up Jelly Bean and the low pricing business model when offering such a tablet with LTE.</p>
<p>Verizon&#8230;.I&#8217;m looking at you&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s going to take a long time for the Nexus 7 to become available in more countries as Google hasn&#8217;t made a lot of content deals outside of the US and UK. And considering the low price point is made possible by the ecosystem bringing in the money, it would make no sense for Google to release the tablet in other countries.<br />
Maybe we&#8217;ll even have to wait for the Nexus 7 eventual succesor. Which sucks., because I really want it.</p>
<p>Hopefully this can push Amazon to release an Amazon Video app for all other Android devices.</p>
<p>Wooooooeow!!!! The world is coming to an end. Am selling my Rezound and getting the galaxy nexus and the nexus 7! From now on its pure Google, the way Martias Duarte intended it to be!</p>
<p>glad i pre-ordered</p>
<p>Considering it only had four months to be made this is pretty amazing.  I&#8217;m sort of on the fence about its lack of camera,  but I&#8217;ve always got a phone with a great camera so I guess it&#8217;s in no way a deal breaker.  What a great price!</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t made in 4 months.  It&#8217;s an ASUS tablet that already existed, which Google snatched up at the end of it&#8217;s development.  They added a new graphics card and motherboard in a few months.</p>
<p>Er I&#8217;m an idiot, I mean they dropped in a brand new SOC.</p>
<p>I know, I hadn&#8217;t read that article before this comment (above) was posted. I&#8217;d still say it&#8217;s a great price, and I&#8217;m very very close to pre-ordering. (I&#8217;m afraid of my own bank balance.)</p>
<p>Same I&#8217;m about a day or two from pre-ordering myself&#8230; I have a Galaxy Nexus though and the 7 inch tablet is so close to my own screen size.</p>
<p>It would make a nice complement I think. I&#8217;ve got a Sensation (4.3&quot;) and a Macbook Pro (13&quot;). 7&#8217; sits quite nicely, especially as a road going device. I&#8217;ve been looking for ages for something like it. Damnit. I just convinced myself.</p>
<p>Just one concern for the Nexus 7, I feel Google really missed a  huge opportunity to  incentivize developers to create tablet specific apps but instead by having phone apps scaled up, the tablet specific offerings in Google Play will remain weak. Other than that, kudos for Google IO and creating a very compelling android tablet.  I hope Amazon has something up their sleeve for their Kindle Fire update.</p>
<p>Android still clearly has issues with tablet&#8217;s UX. As Josh shows in the video, simply rotating the device wrecks a good UI. You also still have apps like Twitter that are literally a big phone UI.</p>
<p>Android doesn&#8217;t want &#8216;tablet only&#8217; or &#8216;tablet specific&#8217; apps, but clearly they need to do a bit more work to create a better overall user experience for tablet users with their strategy. I don&#8217;t see any technical reason why it can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<p>I think the point of this review is to say that the Android tablet experience is no longer poor. It has gotten better, and surely one of the most important factors in a review is price. A good cheap product will obviously score high. We&#8217;re not all made of money&#8230;</p>
<p>Ooops&#8230;wrong comment resposnsce&#8230;</p>
<p>Did you mean to respond to my comment? It would kinda fit.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe not.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t want tablet specific apps, but they do want apps that scale based on display size. What they don&#8217;t want is &#8216;[insert app name here] for tablets!&#8217;</p>
<p>The same principle applies to premium,  pro or paid apps: Google don&#8217;t want them in Google Play. Just use in-app purchases; in the long run you theoretically make more money anyway.</p>
<p>Unrealistic expectations. This is exactly how this conversation will go down.</p>
<p>Google: Here is a suitcase full of money. Please design your twitter app specifically for tablets.</p>
<p>Twitter: so let me get this straight? You designed Android to scale different screen sizes and resolutions but you don&#8217;t want me to use it? You want me to design an App specifically for each if these screen sizes? 3.5, 3.7, 4, 4.3, 4.7, 4.8, 5.3, 7, 7.7, 8.9, 10.1, and 13 inch screens all with different resolutions?</p>
<p>Google: yes I do because Apple fanboys keep on bringing it up and we want to eliminate this perceived weakness which really isn&#8217;t one.</p>
<p>Twitter: screw you.</p>
<p>No that&#8217;d be a terrible movie to force developers to only create tablet apps.  Developing apps for 4.0 look much better on tablets &#8211; the scaled up problem you see now is largely a result of developing for Gingerbread.  Regardless &#8211; giving out thousands of Jellybean tablets to devs will certainly be a kick in the pants.</p>
<p>8.8 seems a bit high, especially when you consider how dismal the Android tablet app experience is.</p>
<p>I can totally understand that it&#8217;s an 8+ given the review, but it feels you might have been a bit kind because of its given price.</p>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;m super excited to see if Google can translate an awesome product like the Nexus 7 into tablet space success and maybe even a Nexus 10.</p>
<p>I think the point of this review is to say that the Android tablet experience is no longer poor. It has gotten better, and surely one of the most important factors in a review is price. A good cheap product will obviously score high. We’re not all made of money…</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good practice to factor in price into review scores because consumers will use the scores to do some basic comparison.</p>
<p>Why buy a 9.3 tablet that cost $500 when you can get an 8.8 that cost $200? Is that 0.5 points really worth that $300?</p>
<p>I hope you see what I mean by that.</p>
<p>I see your point but as a consumer, price does count. The $200 might be the difference between your kids getting new shoes and so you factor in the cost implications of your purchase. Thus, your 8.8 really does mean more because you weigh the benefits and problems up to find the middle ground you are happy with.</p>
<p>You have to factor price in the review. At least a responsible reviewer would. Not that I think Josh or anyone on the verge is a responsible reviewer but that is not the point.  The value is just as important as the display to some people and SHOULD be included in any decent review.</p>
<p>If consumers compare it the way you suggest, then they are stupid. The Nexus score of 8.8 should already factor in the price. If it was $519 like the iPad then it would most likely get a 7.8 or 8 tops. If the iPad was $199 like the Nexus 7, then the 9.3 would scale to a 10 easily. That is how consumers should look at reviews, they shouldn&#8217;t ignore value at all.</p>
<p>The only areas I would ignore in reviews due to my uses would be camera. In fact, I place value ahead of display and ecosystem probably.</p>
<p>great review, the score is justifying the device, I&#8217;m buying the device for sure, but hopefully it&#8217;ll has more tablet optimized apps in the future</p>
<p>Wait, Android&#8217;s homescreen is more &#8220;iOS-like&#8221; because it can auto-arrage the <strong>widgets</strong>? Is anyone noticing something wrong with that sentence?</p>
<p>Nope &#8211; auto arranging home screen items has been iOS behaviour since day one.</p>
<p>Auto-rearranges apps too. Josh just used widgets as the example because it works better with widgets, because they resize themselves etc.</p>
<p>Does anyone seem to know if an MHL HDMI adapter will work with this though from the microUSB port? The web appears to be bare&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not. Engadget had it in their review.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />
And POO GOOGLE! BOO HISS!</p>
<p>I still bought one&#8230;</p>
<p>Looks like Microsoft might have to subsidise their Surface with app profit after all. LULZ</p>
<p>Maybe the Surface based on Windows RT, but not the Surface Pro. If I were even considering the Surface Pro (based on functionality and cost), I wouldn&#8217;t even be thinking about a Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Android can&#8217;t do what I (or most people that &#8220;need&#8221; Intel CPUs) would be doing on their Windows based devices. (without a remote connection)</p>
<p>I;m in Japan&#8230; BRING IT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111</p>
<p>Asia needs some love.<br />
Philippines is waiting on this.<br />
But that&#8217;s just me.</p>
<p>This would compliment my iPhone wonderfully.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what i&#8217;m thinking.</p>
<p>Josh, you&#8217;re great, but do you really think that the screen-squeeze-test matters in this age of feather-touch capacitive displays? I could understand the logic back when we were poking the Nokia 5800 with a stylus, but those days are gone. On a similar note, should you really be criticising a tablet for a thick bezel after countless hours gripping tablets and e-readers by spacious, half-inch borders? I think the heuristic that bezel=bad is dead as far as handheld devices goes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen those two gadget blog memes on The Verge before and I&#8217;m surprised to see them now.</p>
<p>I know its not an average of the separate scores, but 8.8 is a hell far waya from the 7.75. Should it be an iPad the comments would explode &#8230;</p>
<p>Granted some of the scores are more important than the others, even putting the top 4 scores for screen, performance, software and design together gives you just 8.5. This is bullshit josh, I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s merely because every category should be price-based. It&#8217;s just utter non-sense that this screen at $200 bucks got an 8. The 7 on battery and well, are you seriously telling me a 6 on camera should be given the same weight as software.</p>
<p>Their scoring system is bullshit, but the score is about right, this tablet is clearly the best tablet after the iPad (considering the price), and in some ways, it&#8217;s a much better deal. You can buy 3 of these with the same money you buy a 32 GB iPad.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is many reviews here do not feel price-based; lower-end devices which may make more compromises than necessary get absolutely hammered, and the lower price point is often mentioned in passing. If price point is going to become a real factor in these reviews, then The Verge has to work on a more consistent system.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s a different story if you talk percentages, but think about the number of laptops which were pitched against MacBooks that were hundreds of dollars above the price point of the laptop.</p>
<p>If there was a score for price, I imagine that would&#8217;ve shifted the average quite a bit.</p>
<p>I agree, but as i stated above even if you pick the highest marks it gets it nowhere near 8.8. Makes one wonder why he even bothered with the partial scores at all.</p>
<p>To provide an at-a-glance feel for how good particular properties of the tablet are, if you&#8217;re interested in those specific areas?</p>
<p>I think the extra points are given for the fact that this is finally a 7&quot; done right. There&#8217;s been a lot of crap that&#8217;s come before it and now, under the watch of Google, the 7&quot; has come good.</p>
<p>The tech press want to see a competitive landscape and if this failed, it could potentially be game over for Android on tablets. The platform that cried wolf. It makes sense for The Verge to give an extra boost to this as it does everything well, and if it sells could create a longed for alternative to Apple&#8217;s dominance.</p>
<blockquote>However, since it is not a weighted average, the editor reserves the right to adjust the average to better reflect the overall assessment of the product, including <strong>how the price fits.</strong></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>This is not adjusting, this is throwing the scores out of the window. I&#8217;m not disputing this tablet deserves 8.8, but the review should support the score at least a bit.</p>
<p>While understand what you&#8217;re saying. The review reflects the score, the problem seems to the sub scores.</p>
<p>I believe they should make an effort to get users to know that not only it isn&#8217;t a weighted average, but also that they don&#8217;t believe at all that camera and speakers, for example, are just there for reference and are absolutely secondary on a tablet review. It will probably go like this Software &gt; Screen &gt;&gt; everything else.</p>
<p>The first Android tablet that I want, and can actually afford!</p>
<p>As lovely as this looks, right now I own a 7&quot; last-gen Android tablet that I&#8217;ve been using as my <strong>sole</strong> device for 2 years.  Looks like I&#8217;ll have to wait for the ZTE T98 for a current gen device that can do it all (rear camera, 3g data,  phone)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so tempted to switch from my iPad 2 to this!</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t afford both? Jesus, it&#8217;s only a weekend&#8217;s hard labour, and the Nexus 7 is paid for&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>Android design chief Matias Duarte told me that the idea was to mimic &#8220;Steve McQueen&#8221; style driving gloves </blockquote><p>Oh Topolsky, what a name-dropper.</p>
<p>Yeah, this only makes me more excited for my Nexus 7 being delivered. ROLL ON JULY.</p>
<p>Pretty awesome little tablet, but the lack of a music service in the UK, and a general paucity of content in the rest of the English-speaking world beyond the USA and UK, is going to hinder it IMO. Nevertheless I am seriously considering either this or a W8 tablet, even as a British user. If they could get Google Music sorted out for a European release, that would be a great first step. I do really like Play Books, though &#8211; it deserves more success given Google&#8217;s efforts with digitising the world&#8217;s library.</p>
<p>There is a way around this if you can be bothered. You can&#8217;t purchase from Google music but you can set up streaming. I know it&#8217;s annoying and you shouldn&#8217;t have to spend five minutes to get it to work but it is possible. <br />
I&#8217;ve done it, and now i can&#8217;t wait for my Nexus 7.</p>
<p>Aye, I&#8217;ve done it as well.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still a pain that I can&#8217;t buy anything from the music store. :(</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a real chink in google&#8217;s plan if they&#8217;re selling the device at stock.</p>
<blockquote>As a consumption device, Google has gone <em><strong>along</strong></em> way to filling some of the gaps in its ecosystem, even down to giving users new widgets that put their content front and center.</blockquote>
<p>Gramar trolling.</p>
<p>Bring me a 10,1&quot;.</p>

<p>Seems like a great tablet, but no way i&#8217;m going smaller than 9.7 inch (iPad). <br />
It&#8217;s time for the Nexus 10.</p>
<p>I just preordered because others here did and I don&#8217;t want to feel left out.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kinda sad :(</p>
<p>Not really. It&#8217;s worked for me my whole life.</p>
<p>Forever Alone</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s describing forever alone at all.<br />
He seems to be describing most of society actually.</p>
<p>Looks great. I&#8217;m gonna buy this one day!</p>
<p>So&#8230;the only reason to buy a Fire now is not knowing about the existence of this, right?</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that is completely the case.<br />
If you have Amazon prime and really enjoy watching stuff on a 7&quot; tablet then Fire is your choice.<br />
Though with rumors of new Kindle announcements within a month or so it might be a silly one to make now.</p>
<p>well you can get refurbished or used Kindle Fires for a lot less than 200 but you could also just buy a Cheapo Ainol tablet from china if you really wanted to pinch pennies and didn&#8217;t care that your hardware will be outdated or crap</p>
<p>Why no microSD? It is a hd tablet, it has to hold a bunch of hd movies :(</p>
<p>In fact it can&#8217;t hold a single TV show&#8217;s season!</p>
<p>Yeah, i&#8217;m kinda bummed about this lack too.  It&#8217;s making me look into setting up some serious cloud storage for all of my media</p>
<p>Will the nexus work in countries that google currently aren&#8217;t shipping to? I am thinking of getting my hands on one of these puppies&#8230;.I think it hits a nice spot between price, weight and specs for e-reading&#8230;&#8230;any tips for getting this when it ships &#8211; or do I have to go &#8216;eBay style?&#8217;</p>
<p>i would buy one.. but in germany google play ist just APPs and Books.. <br />
we dont have music<br />
we dont have movies<br />
&#8230;.<br />
..</p>
<p>if you want a good ecosystem,  there is just apple.. and this sucks</p>
<p>Agree. If I lived in the US I would&#8217;t of thought twice about pre-ordering one. But in Germany? Not only that there is no content.. there isn&#8217;t even hope for any to come in the future.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>In the screenshot of the notification area (and in the video about 2:30) the string HTC EVA_UL36C2 is shown at the bootom of the notication area. Does anyone else think its strange that it says HTC???</p>
<p>That is the name of the wifi network that Josh was connected to at the time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m assuming he was tethering from an HTC phone at the time.</p>
<p>Adding a MicroSD would have made it a much easier decision. But instead they placed Transformers and many magazines I&#8217;m not interested it.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting that the review would have come out this soon, thank you josh!</p>
<p>It seems like some people are mad at Google because twitter has not made any tablet version of twitter for Android . Odd. If a Dev  doesn&#8217;t want to do it, then so be it. It is the same for any os.</p>
<p>Ipad still has access to some apps which are phone formatted, so deal with it.</p>
<p>It is odd that an app as major as twitter would not be updated though.  And this is a review over what&#8217;s available to a customer of the tablet.</p>
<p>Point made though, I don&#8217;t know why Twitter won&#8217;t make an optimized version.</p>
<p>nice device.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m just wondering how much money they are making on this device. if the margins are razor thin then how much after sales support will there be and how sustainable can the Android tablet market be if other Android OEM&#8217;s can&#8217;t beat this device.</p>
<p>The problem with android is the OEMs.  Is this going to brake 3 times in one year like my current Asus computer did.  My iPad 2 has never broke on me.</p>
<p>How do you know? This is a tablet not a computer, it has about 10* less parts, and is made just as the iPad is. How are you so certain its gonna fail you?</p>
<p>Where is the 64GB Nexus 10?</p>
<p>This is gonna push the Android ecosystem so much&#8230; Just look at the Kindle Fire, it doesn&#8217;t even run normal Android, yet people have stuffed it with apps.</p>
<p>For me the price is great, i wish it had 3g or gps, but the price i can live without it. $200 tablet thats not complete junk. And will get direct google updates, cant beat that at all!</p>
<p>If Asus do a Nexus 7 + (with cellular) this will be an instant purchase.</p>
<p>It does have GPS.</p>
<p>Correct &gt; Sansung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for this to arrive! I love Amazon/Prime and all that but I&#8217;m glad I waited this one out. I can always just log into Amazon/use the app anyway :P</p>
<p>I pre-ordered mine day one. I&#8217;m excited to say the least. I sold my Kindle Fire to help fund this latest purchase, so I&#8217;m without a dedicated e-reader for a couple of weeks, but I have the feeling it will be worth it.</p>
<p>More of a general Q, in Jelly Bean 4.1, is there a decent file system?<br />
One thing that would be ideal would be I able to access photos, music and files on a NAS drive in their actual folder rather than through a media app? I dont remember being able to do this when I had the Archos G9 80 with Honeycomb.<br />
For purely web use, email and streaming music, how does BB Playbook compare? The 16GB Model is basically the same price of £169 over here for the 8GB Nexus 7 . Tempting.</p>
<p>just use ES file explorer</p>
<p>Thanks, that looks spot on!</p>
<p>Really, REALLY impressed with the Jelly Beans. UI looks like something one can pile works in, not just a pretty face with redundant animations that got in the way of works. Ooh and wow only last a few hours, you know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still iffy on them changing up the tablet UI to match the phone UI. It just looks awkward to me.</p>
<p>A rear facing camera would have really sealed the deal on this one.</p>
<p>Agreed. Probably couldn&#8217;t happen at this price  point though.</p>
<p>Agreed, though I would not mind paying a little extra for that.</p>
<p>I think&#8230; I need one of these. As soon as possible.</p>
<p>Vlad would have given this tablet a 6/10.</p>
<p>iPad 2 is still better</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is any information about an international release (Germany)?</p>
<p>Great review Josh , i like the long video review for the curious people who don&#8217;t want to read all the review (which i did at the end )</p>
<p>Maybe in the next tablet review the writer could tell more about what the device is actually used for and why it&#8217;s better at it than your phone or laptop?</p>
<p>I think they are expecting most people to figure out that the screen is a little bigger than your phone and the whole thing is smaller and less cumbersome and less intrusive physically than your laptop.<br />
Also, while a lot of people do have smart phones not everyone does.<br />
And you could buy this tablet and use it on your couch on your wifi (where most tablets do get used) for the price of a couple of months charge for a smart phone data plan.<br />
And a laptop is a crappy way to read in bed in a prone position.<br />
I could go on and on with obvious stuff but&#8230;</p>
<p>Email, web browsing, videos, ebooks, gaming, light productivity.</p>
<p>Anything else? If you can&#8217;t figure out what to use a tablet for, they&#8217;re not for you.</p>
<p>So stoked, can&#8217;t wait till my device gets delivered. This hopefully will sell really well and developers will start making apps designed for the 7 inch for factor. This is basically to jump start the android tablet app selection (and obviously the ecosystem purchases).</p>
<p>What is the point of Google Now if this doesn&#8217;t have a cellular connection?</p>
<p>Wifi, use your phone as a hotspot</p>
<p>It will be somewhat less useful then on devices which are always connected.<br />
But you have to remember that 4.1 isn&#8217;t only for this device.<br />
It&#8217;s just that this device is launching with it.<br />
&#8220;Google Now&#8221; is a much bigger play in the long run.</p>
<p>*then should be &#8216;than&#8217;.<br />
But of course there should also be an effing &#8216;edit&#8217;.</p>
<p>The same people on this forum called the original iPad a big iPhone or iPod Touch. Now this thing, which truly is just a big phone, is a justifiable purchase. The kicker is most of you already have 4&quot;-5&quot; phones running the exact same apps. Clueless as to who this for really. I think it&#8217;s only a suitable purchase for those carrying a flip phone, can&#8217;t afford a real tablet, and still who want access apps while at the airport or in the bathroom.</p>
<p>I would normally agree with you, but for the price. £159 makes this a justifiable purchase for the times (albeit few) where this is a bit better than your supersize phone or your heavier 10&quot; tablet / Ultrabook.</p>
<p>Not for everyone,but for quite a few.</p>
<p>The context is not the same.<br />
That was then, this is now &#8211; as the saying goes.</p>
<p>I do agree with you though that you seem to be clueless about it.</p>
<p>I own a Galaxy Nexus, Motorola Xoom, and a 15.6&quot; laptop. I just pre-ordered this because the Xoom will be given to my parents and I feel 7&quot; is a better form factor for how I was using the Xoom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve pre-ordered mine.  Now WHERE IS IT GOOGLE!!! I hate waiting&#8230;</p>
<p>Does a GPS chip + &#8220;offline&#8221; Google Maps mean that you can download map data on WIFI and then use the GPS to get your current position on it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes &#8211; but it won&#8217;t do navigation turn-by-turn for you offline.<br />
But it will show your position.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be picking one up.  I&#8217;ve wanted to try my hand at Android development and this is the first decent opportunity IMO (for someone that already has an iPhone and iPad).  $200 but it&#8217;s a real Google device that will get first class updates, and the type of market penetration that warrants apps to be specifically developed for it.</p>
<p>Also might make another nice toy :)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s weird how all of the comments so far are ignoring the elephant in the room: Amazon.</p>
<p>- Rumors are swirling about Amazon bringing out a Kindle Fire 2 any day now. Which will probably be as good as or better than the N7, hardware-wise. And maybe Amazon will surprise us with their next version of Fire-Android which will a few killer features that Jelly Bean lacks.</p>
<p>- It won&#8217;t surprise me at all if Amazon undercuts the N7 on price. Because that&#8217;s what Amazon does.</p>
<p>- Google has a <em>terrible</em> track record for selling hardware directly. Everyone seems to assume that they&#8217;ll magically do better this time around. Maybe. Or maybe this will be Google&#8217;s usual trainwreck of screwed up orders, slow shipments, and poor customer service. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>- Overall, my guess is that the N7 will enjoy a brief moment of fame, then will be forgotten when the KF2 eclipses it. It might be worth buying as a collector&#8217;s item. I think it&#8217;s moment in the sun is right now, today. A month from now, it will be a technological footnote.</p>
<p>You might be right. I really don&#8217;t understand why they want to kick Amazon AND OEM&#8217;s in the groin for a tablet that they are not planning on selling as a mass market product (only online), at no profit, and as recent analyses has shown, very little profit from online ads, app sales, etc. Seems like a really good way to destroy relationships and tease Amazon into a reaction.</p>
<p>They are not going to be sold only online.<br />
And Google is a search company foremost at the moment.<br />
But in its crystal ball it easily sees that things like facebook and IOS appstore and Amazon&#8217;s ecosystem are becoming more and more prominent and do not offer full access for search.<br />
Google has to get into these spaces to be able to keep doing what it does or in a few years or ten it will have found itself completely shut out and shutting down.<br />
Google does not need other manufacturers at this point as much as they need it.<br />
It has Motorola now and if it needed to could very quicly pivot to a top-to-bottom company just like Apple is.<br />
I don&#8217;t think that is their plan but it is a hell of a backup situation for it to have.</p>
<p>I thought I in the review they will only be sold in the play store? If thats not the case, than this has to be a success on the iPad scale to risk alienating OEMs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see what the ecosystem has to do with creating hardware. They can do that for OEMs. Although I have to say that I think Google vastly overestimated Android revenue. Also, for those companies you mention, the ecosystem is not the main source of revenue. What is the play then? They have a mobile ad company that can be found in iOS apps , right? What good does controlling the ecosystem do them?</p>
<p>Google might be needed by OEMs, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too late to create a competitor. A lot of OEM&#8217;s already have some content deals in place. Apps might be a problem, but android doesn&#8217;t exactly have a surplus of apps, and if they are easily ported then there goes that advantage. This might be the time to introduce a great tablet OS.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with you on Motorola, I think Google has very little faith in them as a hardware company. But that&#8217;s just speculation. Google has to be EXTREMELY sure that entering the hardware space will be a success before they pull that stunt.</p>
<p>Gamestop in the US has already announced they will be selling it and are in fact taking pre-orders for it.<br />
I doubt they will be the only one.<br />
For Amazon the ecosystem certainly is the main source of revenue.<br />
It isn&#8217;t for Apple, but if you think that 30% they take off the top if of no interest to them then I would disagree.<br />
The problem is that Google sells ads.<br />
And to effectively sell those ads in the future it needs access to data &#8211; because that is the way the ad industry is going.<br />
It also needs to be able to be in a place where people will see those ads.<br />
If Google can&#8217;t search the resources that people are looking for then it will cease to have screentime/presence to sell the ads.<br />
Facebook is closed and doesn&#8217;t allow search by Google.<br />
Amazon marketplace and Apple marketplace are also places where people spend time and give information &#8211; which google probably can&#8217;t search well.<br />
That is why Google needs Google+<br />
I don&#8217;t think it has huge interest in the revenue from Play just like that money isn&#8217;t the primary thing on Apple&#8217;s plate right now.<br />
But it needs to at least have competing products in these areas in the long run so it can harvest data and place ads, etc&#8230;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what Google is doing with Motorolla.<br />
Maybe it will even sell it as has been rumored.<br />
But I don&#8217;t see why.</p>
<p>Say you are right about other companies simply doing their own OS.<br />
I don&#8217;t actually think you are but let&#8217;s say so.<br />
So say this fall Samsung and Asus and Acer and HG all announce that they will cease making Android devices and are forming a partnership which will use its own OS.<br />
Well &#8211; Google would be royally screwed.<br />
But they wouldn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
Because with Motorolla in their back pocket they could pivot almost instantly.<br />
Certainly within one product cycle anyway.<br />
They could not only still have Android hardware out there but they could leverage the same strengths Apple does.  That means fragmentation and difficulty of porting the OS to 20 kinds of hardware setups etc all go away.</p>
<p>Like I said, I don&#8217;t think it is their intent.<br />
The way they&#8217;ve been doing it has been successful enough so far.<br />
But it is a hell of a backup plan.<br />
They&#8217;d be fools to sell off Motorlla.</p>
<p>Actually what they should do is buy dish network and use motorolla to build the boxes for it with Google TV on board.  Then put ad placement in the channel guide and use the revenue to allow them to lower the rates on services.</p>
<p>Ecosystem means apps to me. Amazon makes it&#8217;s money on content, not the apps. The 30% Apple gets is of some interest, sure. But that&#8217;s still not where they make their money.</p>
<p>Mobile ads have yet to produce real revenue. In fact, a lot of companies are struggling with the transition to mobile, not just google. I personally think that the &#8220;dream&#8221; (or nightmare) of highly personalized ads is not the future. Too much activity by lawmakers in that space, especially in Europe.</p>
<p>In any case, it might be a future play, but it&#8217;d pretty much a gamble right now.</p>
<p>Ok, so google + is more important than an ecosystem in terms of data? I would agree with that. They also don&#8217;t need an ecosystem to show the ads.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re assuming that motorola is capable of producing amazing hardware on par with samsung&#8230;and motorola is nonexistent in Europe, and I&#8217;d imagine a number of other continents.fragmentation goes away, but so does diversity, and build quality.</p>
<p>Interesting idea, although I smell channel conflict with that plan.</p>
<p>Some good points, but dont forget that the Kindle Fire was US only, and I can&#8217;t see that changing for the KF2. It seems odd that Google would want to push out the fire though, given it was leading tablets for android.</p>
<p>But then you have to consider that a pure tablet at this cost will motivate a lot of people to pay out, and the developers will come running when the user-base is there. I think that&#8217;s the main idea here</p>
<p>I think your giving Amazon too much credit.  The Fire was basically a rebadged playbook.  Asus has way more experience producing this kind of hardware.</p>
<p>Do you really believe the &quot; next version of Fire-Android which will a few killer features that Jelly Bean lacks?&quot;  The fire runs a forked version of android (gingerbread) that is pretty gimped.  Right now the software isn&#8217;t in the same class.</p>
<p>Yup, I do. Mostly because Google and Amazon have different agendas and are taking Android in different directions. So, sure, I can see Amazon&#8217;s Android being outdated and feature-sparse compared to Google&#8217;s in some ways, but bringing in some very compelling features in areas that Google isn&#8217;t focused on. Like media library management, for example. That&#8217;s an area where both iOS and Android are pretty weak, but is right at the heart of Amazon&#8217;s bread &amp; butter. They might decide to integrate a good solution directly into their Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;and basic tasks like multitasking were nearly instantaneous.&#8221;</p>
<p>nearly. lol.</p>
<p>Great review&#8230;&#8230;..ordered a nexus 7&#8230;&#8230;..my better half will be inheriting my iPad.</p>
<p>Seems like a great tablet, but one hell of a bad move for google.</p>
<p>It clearly doesn&#8217;t see this as a mass market product (only selling it online), but it spoils the market for every OEM out there. Selling it at cost really makes it unbeatable. And as others said, it sure puts pressure on Amazon, which has the power to make a big move here.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t get the strategy.</p>
<p>You pretty much summed it up. It&#8217;s not about revenue it&#8217;s more  so about flooding the market to get more users on AndroidOS. They saw was Amz did and want some of that action.</p>
<p>Yeah, that could be it, but what would be the benefit? Android isn&#8217;t really generating revenue, and amazon of course just wants you to buy content. Maybe I&#8217;m underestimating content revenue for Google.</p>
<p>I was strongly considering the SGS3 next month, but after seeing this a link up of the Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus might be a stronger option for me. It would be really useful for developing also to have a tablet preloaded with jellybean for testing quickly and not relying on the emulator</p>
<p>The SGS3 does look nice, but in the end is it worth paying a premium for quad-core(assuming you get it in Italy) and slower updates, versus a cheaper phone(Galaxy Nexus) with an almost as nice screen that&#8217;s going to get Jelly Bean very soon and will likely get the next major update soon after the new Nexus launches?</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus and tend to get the new Nexus every year. I don&#8217;t <em>need</em> a tablet(I doubt many people do, really) but for Netflix and reading, £159 is a hell of a deal.</p>
<p>This is pretty much my thinking. The S3 has some really nice software, but the idea of updates a month after release just sways me away from it. Plus jelly bean seems to creep upon some of the S3 features anyway. Plus, given if I spend around 300-350 on the nexus/500 on the S3, the price gap almost makes up for the tablet!</p>
<p>As for getting it in Italy, its released here, but I am moving back to the UK in 2 weeks for at least a year, and the nexus phone/tablet together would be a nice way to start the year don&#8217;t you think!</p>
<p>Been waiting for a sub-$250 7&quot; with no compromises to supplement the iPad that my wife uses most of the time ;).  Looks like this is it&#8230;just ordered.  Thanks for the quick review, Josh!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite a feat how cheap this is for how much you get.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t even 1.5 years ago that Motorola was trying to sell the Xoom, which is worse in almost every way except screen size and mobile connectivity, for 4x the price.</p>
<p>This makes me reassess how much phones should be costing, especially with carrier subsidies.</p>
<blockquote> Later, when I left the hotel for the airport, Google Now presented me with a map and an estimated travel time of 27 minutes without having been asked to do so.</blockquote>
<p>This is awesome.</p>
<p>Ecosystem 7/10 – even though Android is still seriously lacking tablet-optimized apps. I get that you get easily excited by new gadgets, Josh, but that&#8217;s really not an objective rating. The rest of the review is great, though.</p>
<p>No rating as a decision by a human is objective.</p>
<p>There really is a fair amount of tablet optimized app&#8217;s. And as the review said, when it comes to the difference between a 4 inch phone and a 7 inch tablet it really isn&#8217;t that great a difference. Ecosystem is not simply rated on how many columns the official twitter app can hold! Plus its a review, its never going to be objective.</p>
<p>Was really hoping to see a sample of how that camera/mic worked in Google hangouts or similar.<br />
Every review mentions it is designed for that and then completely ignores testing it.</p>
<p>Also &#8211; how could you tease that you got a camera app to work with the camera and then not post any samples at all, Josh?<br />
I mean we all know it is meant to be nothing more than serviceable but it is still a review.<br />
I&#8217;d love to actually see a couple of shots with it to look at for myself.</p>
<p>Very true, but it was a 3am post the man was boarding a red-eye &#8211;  maybe he wanted to look fresh for the cam :P</p>
<p>Hope they add a video today.</p>
<p>Should be simple as I am pretty sure you can save and publish hangouts to youtube.<br />
So just do a hangout with a couple of people, at least one of them using a Nexus 7.<br />
Do a few tests with it and then post the whole thing to youtube and put a link up.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why a prominent Tech blog site would still be using Flash for its videos&#8230;WTF &#8220;The Verge&#8221; Its time to move on. I cant watch your videos on chrome browser for mobile and ironically if i wanted to watch your video review of the Nexus 7 on a Nexus 7, i sadly would not be able to, because flash is not supported. Again&#8230; WTF</p>
<p>I believe they have to use Flash to serve ads.</p>
<p>I doubt it. Google is all about adds and there no longer supporting Flash in Jelly bean or in there flagship browser.</p>
<p>&#8220;ironically if I wanted to watch your video review of the Nexus 7 on a Nexus 7, I sadly would not be able to, because flash is not supported.&#8221;</p>
<p>The video plays fine for me. Sent from my (flash-free) iPad. So I reckon you&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>This  player does offer  a mobile compatible version of all videos. This non-flash version is working fine right now on i-phone. What device and operating system are you having issues with? Please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@theverge.com" target="_blank">support@theverge.com</a> .  We will look into it pronto. Thanks.</p>
<p>There will always be a better device coming out. This one meets my needs for browsing, email, books and some video and music content at a price point that is not going to break the bank. Trigger pulled.</p>
<p>Now where&#8217;s my Nexus 10?</p>
<p>I know everyone is screaming where&#8217;s the apps, but with android phones running at around 5&quot; is it really such a bad thing to run a phone app on a 7&quot; tablet?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got little issue running some of these &#8220;phone&#8221; apps on my Xoom. Would it be nice to have a dedicated tablet app instead? Sure but it&#8217;s not a deal breaker.</p>
<p>So no, running these apps on a 7&quot; screen when my phone is 4.65&quot; won&#8217;t be an issue at all. It won&#8217;t be long until there is more Android tablet support for Android.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t decide if I should buy this or a new nexus phone in November.</p>
<p>Not to be negative, but, here&#8217;s some things to think about: HDMI, OTG, MHL, SD, CAM, and, 5.9 GB available free on the 8 GB model.</p>
<p>If you can live w/ this, then OK.</p>
<p>Here are my thoughts:<br />
HDMI &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
OTG &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
MHL &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
SD slot &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
CAM &#8211; don&#8217;t care<br />
8/16GB total &#8211; don&#8217;t care</p>
<p>You know I was there with the HDMI port. Not with the other features you mentioned. But it makes sense,  20 minutes later they presented the Nexus Q, I think Google&#8217;s idea is to connect your tv with your devices through the Q, and not directly, which is way more comfortable if you just think about it. And now that I&#8217;m writting this IT TOTALLY MAKES SENSE!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never understood the fascination of hooking up your phone or tablet to a HDTV. I have better and more capable devices to do that with.</p>
<p>Nhat&#8217;s, don&#8217;t you care that you will only be able to install 5 to 8 high end apps (games) on the 8 gig model.  Sry, that will matter a few months down the road.</p>
<p>Would you also buy a corvette, with a fast engine, but w/ a 6 gallon gas tank?</p>
<p>I have 32GB on my Galaxy Nexus and I have yet to use half of that space. I agree that 8GB is far too small but that&#8217;s what the cloud is for.</p>
<p>A lot of people bought the Bugatti Veyron even though it gets terrible MPGs and doesn&#8217;t have a large enough gas tank.</p>
<p>It sounds like a certain few people in the comments have forgotten that this is supposed to take on the Kindle Fire and not the iPad. Let it be already.</p>
<p>Good point; and by the way, TheVerge score for the Nexus 7 comes to 7.75.  Just saying.</p>
<p>you can do that with all their scores, the only people who point it out though are the people who disagree i guess (we can smell our own lol)</p>
<p>This is $200, yet a phone still costs me like $700 unlocked&#8230; I totally get it, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t get it at all haha.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t charge a ton for phones expecting you to buy them they charge a ton so that you will buy them From a carrier subsidized. It a conspiracy with the carriers..</p>
<p>You have the cart before the horse.</p>
<p>They charge a bunch because they can. Carriers give subsidies so phone makers are now trying to take advantage of this fact.</p>
<p>Horse&#8217;s can totally be trained to push a cart&#8230; haha</p>
<p>Well, this is a biased review. It all reads as if the author truly WANTS to like this piece of hardware.</p>
<p>I give this review a 5.1/10.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t think so, i actually thought this guy was more biased towards apple (from his older reviews), i think i was wrong because this is a good review and it finally sounds like android for tablets is coming into fruition (like it already has for smartphones)</p>
<p>Josh has been a bigger fan of Android since they came out with 4.0 and the Nexus.</p>
<p>so he is biased because it&#8217;s not good? i don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t follow. Clearly this is a good device and Josh has been a fan of Android&#8217;s OS much more so since 4.0 because it is far more versatile than iOS. The device is $200 and it performs like a top contender for it&#8217;s size. Are you just trying to troll?</p>
<p>word, no trolling just misunderstanding :)</p>
<blockquote> because it is far more versatile than iOS.</blockquote>
<p>first, i would avoid making sweeping statements with a strong sense of bias. Are there not enough flame wars in this thread for your liking?</p>
<p>isn&#8217;t that what makes android different from iOS? it&#8217;s versatility?</p>
<p>Bumping the scope from 7.75 to 8.8, without any explanation, sounds like this might be the case.</p>
<p>Wanna read a review of this same tablet from a devout Apple fanboi&#8217;s point of view?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/06/28/google-nexus-7-hands-on-preview-jelly-bean-galaxy-nexus/" target="_blank">http://www.bgr.com/2012/06/28/google-nexus-7-hands-on-preview-jelly-bean-galaxy-nexus/</a></p>

<p>nexus 7 w/amazon content &gt; ipad&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..if only :(</p>
<p>An 8.8 on the Verge? I will have to pick one up. From the looks of the video when Josh was demoing the search, it felt much snappier than Siri. I&#8217;m excited for this. Gonna have to buy one before the semester begins! Great review!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not sure what Siri does that&#8217;s any better than what we saw here.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s snarky</p>
<p>well, i tried &quot;find local sushi resturants: on my ipad. (obviously iOS 6)</p>
<p>Instead of  giving me the first result on a map, it gave me 15 results, in a very nice (non linen i might add, just semi transparent and very flat) format, in order of nearest to me, to furthest, along with address, average yelp star review and average cost of food (in a 1-5 $$ kind of way)</p>
<p>clicking once on any gives you the option to call or map it out.</p>
<p>Generally waht people go on siri about is it&#8217;s context. You can set an alarm, and then 2 hours later ask siri to &#8220;change that last alarm&#8221; &#8220;cancel tomorrow&#8217;s alarm&#8221; the understanding of context in human speech.</p>
<p>to me, that part, and the geofencing (siri knows where you are) were always the more interesting aspects of the tech rather than wolfram.</p>
<p>That, for sure, is a definite advantage for Siri.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m sure we could agree that both techs are very nice</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting this for my mom for her 76th birthday.</p>
<p>I have absolutely, positively, <strong>NO desire</strong> to own this thing.</p>
<p>But at $200, I&#8217;m sure as hell gonna buy one.</p>
<p>Possibly the most honest, and funny post, so far.</p>
<p>+1 for Pride and Prejudice :-)</p>
<p>Half of the Play store Content is not available outside the US, so even with this score and Price point the tablet is of no use anywhere outside the US, which is a shame.</p>
<p>A few reminders:</p>
<p>This thing will NOT sell a lot of units unless it gets picked up by a retailer that wants to advertise it like crazy.</p>
<p>Ipad has more commercials on TV and Billboards than all other tablets combined times ten.  Even with great product you have to market them if you want people to buy a lot.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that Apple is a marketing company as much as it is a computer company with great products and great ads.</p>
<p>Nexus devices are for developers, hackers, and technology enthusiasts, not for the general public.  Jelly Bean is a way more refined than previous versions of android.  I&#8217;m running it on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus and I love it.  It&#8217;s very good.</p>
<p>can something like this play amazon instant video just fine? <br />
i have a kindle and love using prime for some tv series</p>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s an app for that</p>
<p>cool &#8211; hopefully someone can demonstrate how this app looks on the nexus 7</p>
<p>If I have an Ipad why would I want to buy this? (serious question)</p>
<p>If I own a Porsche GT3RS, why would I want to buy a Ferrari 458? (not so serious question)</p>
<p>to impress the ladies?</p>
<p>Underhung?</p>
<p>You might not want to.  The iPad is pretty nice.  I have the iPad 3, but I just signed up to buy one of these (it&#8217;s the google now thing that&#8217;s really pulling me in) and I&#8217;m going to sell my iPad as soon as it gets here.</p>
<p>But to answer your question better, I think the google now thing is a pretty killer feature.  Always have a mapped/time estimated route back to a place you need to go is awesome.  It&#8217;s light, probably not as scratch prone (at least not the back) and it&#8217;s tossable&#8230;  You&#8217;re less likely to get mugged for it.  You don&#8217;t look as ostentatious carrying it around.  You get geek cred.  It&#8217;s lighter, so you won&#8217;t develop as many strange, before unseen medical ailments from it (Think Wii related pains from a few years back).  Additionally, Android is better integrated (easier to share things more ways) and has less throwback design influence.  ICS is awesome, if you don&#8217;t know.  I assume Jelly Bean is awesomer.  :-)</p>
<p>&gt;You’re less likely to get mugged for it</p>
<p>I am sold. I am getting one for every one of my family members.</p>
<p>bahaha</p>
<p>I dunno where you must be to encounter thieves with discerning tastes.<br />
A thief is a thief.</p>
<p>I live on the earth, where more money can be had for a stolen iPad than a stolen Nexus 7.</p>
<p>What planet are you from?</p>
<p>haha! the same one that a thief won&#8217;t second guess anything if they&#8217;re going to steal. Money could be had with either item, you really think a thief is keen enough/will be able to sell something at fair market price.  Let me know when somebody does a report on a thieves likelihood to be a product snob.</p>
<p>Again a thief is a thief.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re equating thieves with fools.  They&#8217;re clearly not all stupid, just immoral.</p>
<p>For some reason the mods don&#8217;t want us to dance.  Perhaps we should sit this one out.  While I disagree with your arguments, you dance just fine.</p>
<p>good question, but for $200 you can put it in the &#8220;why the f@#$ not&#8221; category</p>
<p>This looks awesome but i love how google just screwed every manufacture that makes android tablets by selling this at cost.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Microsoft just pull a similar move?</p>
<p>I could be wrong but I don&#8217;t think Microsoft could sell the surface at cost. Yea they might make some money from their app store but not nearly enough to justify it.</p>
<p>This is similar to what they did with the Nexus One.  The manufacturers aren&#8217;t living up to their end of the bargain, so they are stimulating the market.  I suspect the other manufacturers will follow with better hardware quickly.</p>
<p>Oh and they screwed every manufacturer except Asus, but for most manufacturers, these are niche products, not given much effort, so it shouldn&#8217;t hit them too hard.</p>
<p>Yea i don&#8217;t really understand &#8220;who&#8217;s&#8221; cost? is it the cost to make the tablet? Or google&#8217;s cost to buy the tablet? If its the cost to make the tablet google must be paying asus a little extra.</p>
<blockquote>In fact, it’s the first Android tablet that I can confidently recommend to buyers — and not just because it’s got a low price tag (though that certainly helps). </blockquote>
<p>Hm, I find it hard to believe that Josh has spent that much time with many Android tablets if he feels this way.  My $400 Asus tablet with 32 GB of storage, 10 inch screen, and the same processor feels and performs pretty damn well.</p>
<p>But, does it perform better than an iPad? That&#8217;s really the question for tablets. This does in many ways.</p>
<p>Well, I think my tablet also generally performs as well as the iPad.</p>
<p>i think the key word is &#8220;confidently&#8221;, while the Asus tablets are great the normal consumer should probably buy an ipad, and i would have to agree with that</p>
<p>How is the screen brightness? Anandtech&#8217;s minireview shows that the Nexus 7&#8217;s screen is even dimmer than the Touchpad&#8217;s, and the Touchpad&#8217;s screen is too dim for me even at maximum brightness. Can you please comment on this? Thanks.</p>

<p>They have a breakdown comparison of brightness and more.</p>
<p>Just saw a TV commercial for the Kindle Fire, and made me think that Google is going to have to advertise this to a Amazon or Apple level if they want this to succeed as well at the Fire. Has anyone seen any TV commercials for this, or heard if Google is planning any?</p>
<p>I love the use of non-expensive, yet distinctive and pleasant materials, i.e. for the back.</p>
<p>I want this but I already have GT10.1 and a Galaxy Nexus w/ Jelly Bean.  I might sell the GT10.1 to buy this, but I am afraid that I will miss the bigger screen and rear facing camera.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and to all the people saying that taking pictures with a tablet is stupid, I&#8217;ll give you a few uses.</p>
<p>1. During Video Chat showing first person view.<br />
2. Taking pictures of cool things happening in front of you when you&#8217;re at home hanging out with friends and family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not something I would ever use to take pictures with out in public.  But I rarely use my tab in public.  Mostly it&#8217;s for browsing while on vacation, at private meetings to share content. and home use.  Tablets are too big to be just carrying them around.</p>
<p>I have seen people just carrying them around.  (get a better phone with a bigger screen)</p>
<p>I guess I will never understand when Verge commenters became so one sided.</p>
<p>Which side is that?</p>
<p>Do you really have to ask? The verge is a haven for Apple fanboys. Haha</p>
<p>Very nice tablet. Now lets just hope that developers would start making apps for tablet.</p>
<p>Not unless marketshare picks up.</p>
<p>Looks awesome! Definitely THE tablet for the masses. I&#8217;m also getting the feeling that when I eventually actually buy a tablet, I&#8217;d prefer it to be roughly this size. 10&quot; still seems a bit big to me.</p>
<p>Typo: "It then repeated this magic when I landed I landed"<br />
Should be: It then repeated this magic when I landed</p>
<p>The Verge claimed that the Lumia 900 had a weak app selection and they gave the ecosystem a rating of 4.0. Then they say that Android tablets have a small app selection(probably smaller then Windows Phone) and they give the ecosystem a 7.0 rating. What gives?</p>
<p>One you are comparing a phone to a tablet, and two, they are indicating poor selection of tablet specific software, but most of all those other Android apps are still able to run on this, just not geared towards a tablet.</p>
<p>In my experience most Android phone apps run horribly on tablets. For me it wasn&#8217;t even worth installing most phone apps. But that&#8217;s just my opinion I guess.</p>
<p>Fair, but this is more of a micro-tablet. It is far closer in size to a phone (in feel) than a full tablet.</p>
<p>In my experience, it is quite opposite. Most apps I have on my phone run perfectly well on my Xoom with ICS.</p>
<p>Well for one this will drive the tablet ecosystem up in a matter of weeks, due to its cheap pricing and attractive features (look at the Kindle Fire). The Lumia 900 is now stuck with whatever apps there are right now, with no incentive for developers to make more.</p>
<p>There is plenty of incentive for devs to make more apps for Windows Phone. Mainly Windows 8. Windows Phone and Windows 8 share the exact same kernel which makes porting Windows apps over to Windows Phone a piece of cake. When Windows 8 is released expect the size of the Windows Phone marketplace to grow even faster then it already is.</p>
<p>What incentive? The Lumia 900 won&#8217;t even receive Windows 8.</p>
<p>I was talking about the Windows Phone OS, not the Lumia 800.</p>
<p>Because Android is better than Windows for now. Duh! Unless you actually think Windows phone 7.5 currently has better apps than Android 4.1?</p>
<p>This may change with Windows 8 though if they can successfully merge Windows 8 pro, RT, Wind0ws Phone 8 into one cohesive family.</p>
<p>This tablet looks really impressive.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the review was made in TheVerge office, without all that euphoria from the Google IO marketing. The device looks really promising, but I&#8217;m always suspicious when the review ends with the word &#8220;period&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lets not forgot that this is a pure Google Tablet that will get upgrades and love directly from Google. The main reason i want it&#8230;It is a NEXUS! That&#8217;s it, pure and simple. Love the price, love android, and of course the Google ecosystem. I&#8217;m ordering 2 of them.</p>
<p>Yeah, having that smirk when Android 5.0 comes out and this is the first tablet to get it, while newer, more capable tablets wait 4 months &#8211; never. :P</p>
<p>In terms of value the nexus 7 is a clear winner over the iPad. It has 90% (if not more) of the features, a shiner OS, yet costs 40%. There is now no longer a reason  to spring for an iPad, unless one is rich and only desires the best.</p>
<p>i agree, i hope they market it properly though</p>
<p>Landscape mode! Can Nexus 7 turn to landscape mode? Especially in Chrome can we view the web page in full screen + landscape mode? It seems to me all photos are taken in portrait mode&#8230;</p>
<p>I pray someone answers this. If I buy this, can I tv-out to my lcd tv and watch slingplayer or whatever happens to be on the screen?</p>
<p>No, this has been answered many times before.</p>
<p>My only question &#8211; this is around the ecosystem score.</p>
<p>How can this get a 7 in the ecosystem when there are basically no such thing as Android tablet apps?</p>
<p>Probably because Android 4.1 is a great ecosystem regardless of their app philosophy? What are you going to do? Give a great and flexible OS a zero because app developers prefer not to use the scaling features properly?</p>
<p>Anyways, if you want to nitpick every single score there are much more glaring discrepencies than the one you pointed out. Like the fact that the new iPad got a 10 in battery life for being much worse than the iPad2 battery life while this got a 7 for being quite good for a tiny battery.</p>
<p>Just calling for consistency, that&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>Ecosystem to me isn&#8217;t just the OS &#8211; it&#8217;s all the surrounding parts that make it an ecosystem &#8211; and right now, this doesn&#8217;t have it.</p>
<p>Tons of reviewers do not use consistency in their reviews, like the example I used from the  iPad 3 review. I mean it takes 50 million times longer to charge and doesn&#8217;t last nearly as long as the ipad2 and Galaxy tab 7.7 and it gets a 10 in battery life.</p>
<p>I figured that people would realize by now that the reviewers impression of the device skewers the scores in all areas. If the reviewer likes the product, he will overlook more things than you and I might. That is human nature and everyone, no matter how unbiased they think they might be, has biases.</p>
<p>If we want truly objective and consistent scores for each sub section of a review, we would have to start letting robots do the reviews. Otherwise, we are not going to all agree on the scores.</p>
<p>I personally think that a 7 is way too low considering this is a new major OS release that brings some genuinely excellent features to the table.</p>
<p>So would you give the ecosystem a higher score if this was a 4.65 inch phone instead? I disagree with that.</p>
<p>7 is actually pretty low considering Jelly Bean is in any ways better than IOS6.</p>
<p>Honestly, they were better off just leaving the name ICS (Ice Cream Sandwhich) and tagging 4.1 next to it.</p>
<p>A .1 increments needs a new OS name? Should of left Jellybean for 5.0, but I guess that&#8217;s for Key Lime Pie&#8230; err v4.1.1</p>
<p>Seems you don&#8217;t know how Android releases are labeled. 1.0 increases reservered for major updates and 0.1 releases are for minor updates and 0.0.1 are bug fixes for the firmware. The next Android release will be 4.2.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as an Android tablet app, you should try looking before you misspeak.</p>
<p>This tablet is capable of running any app in the Google Play store, that is enough to warrant the 7.0 score.</p>
<p>No landscape mode and lack oif the nice tablet home screen interface are two turn downs of this tablet for me but i believe will be easily &#8220;repaired&#8221; by XDA guys. Right now i&#8217;m checking all the USA shopping services to get one. Price/features ratio seems to be a winner.</p>
<p>You do realize that only the launcher is locked to portrait right?</p>
<p><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/6/27/1340826827960/Google-Nexus-7-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Also pretty sure that nearly any 3rd party launcher will correct this.</p>
<p>Oh, no i didnt! But what i loved is the Honeycomb extra buttons designed for tablets, made the device more &#8220;pc-like&#8221;.</p>
<p>Thank you Josh! Defiantly will pick one up!</p>
<blockquote>&#8230;is the fact that the homescreen doesn’t have a landscape view.</blockquote>
<blockquote>&#8230;and I can’t figure out why Google would have removed this functionality, which was present in Honeycomb.</blockquote>
<p>Well isn&#8217;t that because it runs the phone UI? Does it display all apps like it&#8217;s a phone too?</p>
<p>Seeing as how Chrome uses the Tablet UI, I&#8217;m guessing no.</p>
<p>Will the gps work on the Nexus 7 without an internet connection?</p>
<p>Yes, offline maps.</p>
<p>So if you take a phone, download a map, pull the sim card, the navigation features will still work?</p>
<p>Yes. GPS doesn&#8217;t require data, downloading the maps from the internet does, however.</p>
<p>I just ordered a Nexus 7 (I know, I probably should of checked into this first), but, I have a question that maybe someone who is more knowledgeable about Android than myself may be able to answer:</p>
<p>Does Netflix stream HD content to tablets? Specifically, the Nexus 7 if anyone knows. Or is everything SD? I have played with Android 4.0/ICS on a Motorola Xoom (Wi-Fi), and naturally YouTube can do HD streaming, however the Netflix app appears (at first glance, anyways) to only do SD.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yes, Netflix will do HD over wifi.</p>
<p>Should have. Should HAVE.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s in the box?</p>
<p>My biggest question is how will this compete with the Fire in terms of the content ecosystem (not apps, but books, periodicals, TV shows and movies).</p>
<p>It seems to me that Amazon has an enormous lead in that arena.  Yes, I know that the Kindle app will run on the Nexus just fine, but Amazon has done a few things to entice people to by into the Fire, by introducing free titles for Kindle owners.  Kindle app users on non-Kindle devices don&#8217;t have free access to this content, and the number of free titles (both in books and video-based content) looks pretty large.</p>
<p>Awesome video review Josh, Verge just knows how to do this, keep it up, thanks.</p>
<p>These Apple vs. Android debates are getting so damn old. I mean c&#8217;mon. If you wanna have a real debate, why not make a thread on one of the niche forums and have it there instead of vomiting all over the review of a product?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s silly because the Nexus 7 and iPad aren&#8217;t even comparable. People who wanna spend 500 bucks on a tablet will buy iPads. People who wanna spend 200 to 300 range will probably strongly consider buying the Nexus 7. They aren&#8217;t in any of the same categories to even consider the two &#8220;competitors&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it either.  I can understand some comparisons with the Fire, but then that doesn&#8217;t lend itself as easily to fanboy rage arguments since both are part of the same overarching ecosystem.</p>
<p>I own an iPad, and I&#8217;m seriously considering a Nexus, but I am also still looking seriously at the Fire, mostly due to the huge amount of content that Amazon offers compared to Google.</p>
<p>Thats no fun, this is more fun, I actually prefer debates here, I like reading through this.</p>
<p>Man all the arguing over iPad vs Android&#8230;.. Really people you are your own worst enemies. The only ones winning the arguments are the ones that are putting your money into their Bank Accounts.</p>
<p>Ford vs Chevy. Does it really matter which is better? That is the very reason I drive a Dodge. =)</p>
<p>Google specifically designed it as their content consumption device after analyzing what made Kindle Fire a success. Andy Rubin has said what Android tablets lacked was a &#8220;complete&#8221; media service. This meant Google trying hard to build up Google Play Store.</p>
<p>I am not sure if his analysis is complete. I think Kindle Fire&#8217;s success wasn&#8217;t just Amazon having good media portfolio. I think one of the key reason is &#8220;Amazon Prime&#8221;. A lot of people who already had Amazon Prime got the device. And who didn&#8217;t get to experience for a month to try out some free media contents.</p>
<p>Google Play doesn&#8217;t have that much of an existing users. Also, the Amazon Prime membership (and Xbox Live membership as well) may give you a smaller market than no membership (or free membership), but it gives the service a better set of loyal paying customers.</p>
<p>I think Google Play (at least the media side) will need some kind of a subscription/membership program (as well as expanding the content portfolio). This membership should allow some limited free contents.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I am not sure Google Play can catch up to other services, or eventually a continued success of Nexus media consumption device (Nexus Q included).</p>
<p>Great, well thought out post. My sediments exactly.</p>
<p>Google is too late, playing catch up from this far back will only make defeat worse.</p>
<p>Google Play doesn&#8217;t have many existing users?</p>
<p>Every Android user is an existing Google Play user&#8230;</p>
<p>Resisted a couple impulse buys of this yesterday. But since Josh says its good, ill be pre-ordering it shortly.</p>
<p>Google Play/Prime Partnership!</p>
<p>Im a googleholic, and even at $200 I still wouldn&#8217;t buy this. I rather spend the extra $200 &#8211; $300 for a complete tablet and just get the iPad 2.</p>
<p>Well, Windows 7 tablets are arguably more complete than even the iPad. They offer processors and gpu&#8217;s of a magnitude higher than anything in the iPad and Nexus7. They benefit from being able to use uncompromising software in a multi-tasking format that can both be equal and greater than what Apple and Google offer. I&#8217;m not messing with any of them, but I see the Win7 tablets as being more complete than what Android and iOS can offer. Between the iPad and this, I&#8217;d choose the Nexus. Simply because it&#8217;s good enough for the price point right now. In the future, I&#8217;d feel less bad about upgrading to something else considerably more powerful and capable.</p>
<p>Competition is good for the free market and especially go for inspired innovation. I would credit Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire for setting the value bar, while giving credit to Apple&#8217; s iPad line for raising the usable real world performance bar.</p>
<p>Vapors of windows surface ebb and flow gently as the Nvidia Asus Android Google mothership lowers the boom with tablet value domination that will sell in apple-esque quantities!</p>
<p>Woot Woot Nexus 7</p>
<p>as an ipad owner (1gen and 3gen) i can honestly say that the 7 inch tablet is where it&#8217;s at and i want one, and i think if people actually tested this out they would agree, but i know everyone likes bigger</p>
<p>I will wait for it to drop to $99</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how the whole process works, but hopefully content providers in all the entertainment industries allow Google to get music, movies, tv shows, etc. out to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>$200 is such a good price.</p>
<p>Thank you Amazon for setting that trend.</p>
<p>This is looking like quite a nice little device&#8230; not that I need anymore technology in my life, but I have never owned an Android device and this is the first thats really peaking my interest&#8230; if we hit some good specials come the holidays I may have to pick one of these up.</p>
<p>What an Apple fanboy.</p>
<p>Can we agree to shun any poster that calls a reviewer or another poster any kind of &#8220;fanboy&#8221;?</p>
<p>I would like that. This review alone should show how unbiased Josh is. He just loves good shit.</p>
<p>josh, that was the best reviews I&#8217;ve seen on this tablet. I think you gave it a fair score of 8.8 and your video was very detailed and to the point. keep up the good work.</p>
<p><em>"Duarte told me that the design was intentional, not a victim of cheap parts…"</em></p>
<p>Gosh, I&#8217;m shocked that a Product Manager would call out a feature as intentional rather than cheap.</p>
<p>Gr8 tablet for android, eager to buy soon :)<br />

<p>Its a game changer. All game changers should be given an automatic 9 IMO</p>
<p>Who needs 300,000 apps in the first place?<br />
I never understood this &#8220;Lack of apps&#8221; argument about Android.</p>
<p>I have about 20 apps on my iPhone I use somewhat regularly.</p>
<p>I just pre-ordered this Nexus 7 tablet and went window shopping in Google Play.<br />
Every single App I use in iOS has an Android version OR it`s equivalent.</p>
<p>Can you name a common/popular app iOS has that Android doesn&#8217;t have the same or an equivalent for?</p>
<blockquote>Who needs 300,000 apps in the first place?<br />
I never understood this "Lack of apps" argument about Android.</blockquote>
<p>Thank you!  Just an empty justification/argument.</p>
<p>I have about 100 apps on my iPhone and I use at least 40 daily.  See how my experience is different than yours? That is why the argument can and should be made.</p>
<p>Where do you find the time to use 40 apps per day?</p>

<p>Those apps all get used, and if isn&#8217;t one game, it is another (maybe tiny wings or doodle jump)</p>
<p>So why don&#8217;t you all just hush.</p>
<p>Haha you need to get off your tablet more and get a life if use 40 apps everyday. And padding the 40 list with super basic stuff like mail and safari doesn&#8217;t help to hide your fanboy ism at all.</p>
<p>i would have to force myself to get to 40 used apps in a day, lol</p>
<p>with that being said, android has more than 100 apps, so you are covered bro</p>
<p>Good/Great apps.  I have bought and sold 3 different android phones because I cannot accept the quality of their apps.  Sorry</p>
<p>I think the question there will be what you consider to be equivalent.  I could say a text editor is the &#8220;equivalent&#8221; of Pages or a sound board is the &#8220;equivalent&#8221; of Garageband.  Just about everything has some similar apps in the same category.  But are they extremely polished, high quality apps, or just something that sortof does the same thing?</p>
<p>This would be a bad table to have, but how does it help me work? Are there any Development IDE&#8217;s that support tablet mode? Are there any browsers besides Chrome that will give me an experience comparable to the desktop? It&#8217;s tough to even think of leaving the x86 world behind for something based upon ARM. I really wish the AMD or Intel would get more aggressive with their tablet offerings.</p>
<p>So what you&#8217;re saying is that tablets aren&#8217;t for you at all. And maybe, must maybe, the Windows 8 Surface might fill that void for you.</p>
<p>Yea, and I made a couple of really bad typo&#8217;s. It should read: &#8220;This wouldn&#8217;t be a bad tablet to have&#8221;</p>
<p>Surface is appealing in just the few known specs, but price (competitive with ultrabooks?) and the fact that the bootloader may be locked are issues. WinRT tablet&#8217;s have to use locked bootloader&#8217;s, but the higher end device actually running Windows 8 is a mystery. More than likely it will have a locked bootloader, but Microsoft hasn&#8217;t explicitly said so yet.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t put it past MS to lock it up tight since it&#8217;s their own hardware.</p>
<p>This looks great&#8230;love the expanded video component to the review as well</p>
<p>Nice Review Josh!</p>
<p>Lofty scoring but after watching the video review it makes perfect sense. In terms of net overall value to real world performance, this will raise the bar for every other android tablet.</p>
<p>I have played with several dozen android tablets, and they all felt half baked compared to the iPad, iPad 2 and iPad 3.</p>
<p>While the Kindle Fire was a great deal for its price, the antiquated software on the fire made it less appealing.</p>
<p>I have a long history of using asus mainboards in custom PC builds and they have been lovely! Sadly some of their latest boards seem to have DOA problems according to new egg reviews. Hopefully Asus&#8217;s tablet hardware returns to their history of quality construction.</p>
<p>I have to admit, this glowing review almost motivated my consumer side, but after that Cherrypal Asia disaster, I am hesitant to invest in any &#8220;price too good to be true&#8221; android hardware. That said, if this will work as a GPS to replace my garmin, I am going to drop by Best Buy and pick one up when they are available retail.</p>
<p>I wrote up a editorial posting on this subject on my blog FYI:</p>
<p><a href="http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html" target="_blank">http://priusblack.blogspot.com/2012/06/google-nexus-7.html</a></p>
<p>By the way, can we get some reports on how stylus&#8217;s work with this tablet?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know myself. I was really hopig for it to be pressure sensitive, but since its not, I&#8217;d like to see how stylus performance ranks.</p>
<p>¡Yeah, I&#8217;d buy this to create some content using Sketchbook Mobile!</p>
<p>Am I the only who thinks that Google seriously needs Google Play giftcards? They want to promote themselves now as a content distributor &amp; not everyone has a credit card, especially those little tykes who might want this. That alone is a pretty major market.</p>
<p>Smart idea since I wouldn&#8217;t want my credit card linked to my kid&#8217;s Google Play account. Thankfully I don&#8217;t have any kids yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard too many horror stories from parents with kids that use their iPads.</p>
<p>Holy flame war, Batman.</p>
<p>Car analogies.</p>
<p>Steve McQueen Gloves on the 7, and MS has a kick stand that has a satisfying click as though a car door was closed. <br />
 <br />
At least Google didn&#8217;t make it match the leather from iCal.</p>
<p>nice review josh, i think you hit all the points of interest. as frugal as i find my spending habits,<br />
i almost want a &#8216;smaller&#8217; tablet to lug around and work with. i prefer the ~7 inch range over the<br />
larger ipad. makes me wonder how popular this form factor actually is to most people. from the<br />
looks of it i would already take this over the kindle fire without much hesitation. my only issue<br />
is that i already own a cheap pre-paid phone, an ipod touch, and and macbook pro. having to add<br />
a 4th or 5th gizmo to the old back-pack gets to be a little much, and i just want to condense my<br />
devices. after seeing this i&#8217;m also sketchy on how well microsoft can seriously compete with the<br />
surface in this market with apple and google, even if it can run full-blown desktop applications.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t you get an iPhone to replace the iTouch and the phone, and go with this and the MacBook Pro?</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re not that wedded to App Store content, you could have even more options for a phone replacement.</p>
<p>Good review, but I&#8217;m a little put off by the fact that ecosystem has taken a lesser role with the Google experience.  Windows Phone was ripped from one end to the other for not having the greatest selection of apps even though it comes on great heard in many cases.  What&#8217;s difference?  Why would I be better off with this table with damn near no &#8220;tablet&#8221; apps than I am with Windows phone which does have some apps and much more developer support (compared to the Android tablet developer pool)?   Just sayin&#8230;</p>
<p>Windows phone has more developer support than Android? What?</p>
<p>This tablet is capable of using both phone and tablet apps. The tablet apps will come now that ICS and JB are the focus of tablet OEMs.</p>
<p>Android has more tablet apps than WP has phone apps (yes they do). AND then all the non-optimized apps still work too.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of apps really need no optimization. Games for instance run perfectly fine on a 720p screen whether it&#8217;s 4&quot;or 7&quot; (or 10&quot;).</p>
<p>And then the non-optimized apps. Does it really matter that Skype (owned by MS) is not optimized for tablets? No of course it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Good review! It looks like a nice machine. I like the 7 inch size but I still prefer my iPad. The thing is, like many, I have invested too much in apps and features of the iPad that I can&#8217;t just switch. The iPad as been integrated into my way of life.<br />
Still I hope the Nexus 7 can grow into a strong competitor in this market.</p>
<p>Great tablet for the price. Might be supplementing my iPad soon. Too bad Android is a mess and the tablet apps on it are pure shite. Great for browsing the web and ereading though.</p>
<p>true true I feel the same&#8230; Migth be a &#8220;@ work media player&#8221;</p>
<p>With the popularity of this device, the apps will come. Just watch.  It&#8217;s a repeat of the Nexus One revolution all over again.</p>
<p>And while Android made be messy as a whole, on the Nexus lineup, it&#8217;s a great experience&#8230;.particularly on this device.</p>
<p>I have shadowgun on my <strong>cough</strong> iPad3 but what&#8217;s the THD version?</p>

<p>ah&#8230; i c</p>
<p>This is going to do for tablets what the Nexus One did for phones.</p>
<p>People who deride the Nexus One as a failure have never understood what it accomplished because they get distracted by the Google direct-to-consumer sales strategy flop.  Everybody forgets how weak the specs of most Android phones were at the time.  The Nexus One changed all that.  Google laid down a benchmark.  OEMs started making better devices.  Developers started coding apps on the Nexus One.  And Android took off.</p>
<p>In a year from now, lots of developers will be showing off Android tablet formats inside their apps or tablet exclusive apps.  And hardware OEMs are really going to step.  I fully expect that in 2013, we&#8217;ll see 8inch tablets with 1080p displays, 16GB of memory, quad core processors, etc. for $200.  And we&#8217;ll be able to thank the Nexus 7 for getting the ball rolling.</p>

<p>Your argument is too strong, I can&#8217;t with compete.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Can I has  that wallpaper?</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m correct, this is the highest score the Verge has ever given a product. What bullshit.</p>

<p>Maybe this will make you feel better about its score. Article posted by the biggest Apple fanboi ever!</p>

<p>Ipad 3 review says hi! Or did you mean to say highest score for an Android product?</p>
<p>What sort of volume or deal has Asus got worked out to make their margins on this? If I recall correctly, the Fire was to be a loss leader at its price point and relatively lackluster hardware in order to get Amazon purchases. But they own the hardware and the pipe, so its OK. With the much greater specs and build quality evident in the review, I&#8217;m trying to figure out how Asus will make any money off this as a pure hardware play unless the bet is that they sell hundreds of millions of them&#8230; or they have some sort of content revenue sharing plan worked out with Google. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Asus makes thier money from Google buying thier hardware. Google is selling the tablet at the same price or very close to it that they are paying Asus to build it. Google is paying for all advertising. Therefore Asus takes very little risk wiht a potentially huge reward.</p>
<p>No forward camera?   Not an iPad killer then from the outset.</p>
<p>Your input means a lot just because of your username. I look forward to your future posts. Where can I subscribe to your newsletter?</p>
<p>Ipad Nano then.</p>
<p>The market is replete with Android tablets, but none have made a dent in iPad sales.</p>
<p>This tablet is bigger than a phone and some well developed phones rely upon the camera to, oh say, take a picture and update to Facebook et al.</p>
<p>In  tablet this large they could have incorporated a phone &#8211; okay they will in the next release I lay my money down.  As it is, the SN uptakers wont buy it.</p>
<p>With its size and price point, the Nexus 7 was never supposed to be a contender with the iPad. It&#8217;s also not meant to replace a phone. Instead, it is a pocket sized, multifunctional device that can be used to consume entertainment. Its competition is the Kindle Fire and the Nook Color, both of which are children&#8217;s toys compared to Nexus 7.</p>
<p>as an ipad owner, i think it will dent the ipad sales because plenty of people (especially these days) don&#8217;t want to spend $400+ on a tablet, plus the 7 inch tablet is the sweet spot in my opinion (after a couple of years with my ipad it could a slightly smaller, i know first world problems), they need to market it better though</p>
<p>The screen is half the size of the iPad. This was never a threat to iPad.. which, in case you hadn&#8217;t heard, has a Retina display.</p>
<p>yea i have the ipad 3, looks great (especially w/HD movies) but it really isn&#8217;t a game changer (unless you compare it to anything that is older than 3 years of course), again the way it&#8217;s going to compete with the ipad is it&#8217;s $200 pricepoint and 7 inch screen (which in my opinion feels better than the ipad)</p>
<p>the nexus 7 isn&#8217;t competing with the ipad3 in any way.</p>
<p>I really wanted to like this tablet, and with one important exception, I do. I&#8217;ve been waiting for this to come out since it was first rumored 3-4 months ago. BUT, the lack of a MicroSD slot is a deal-killer for me. 8 or 16 GB of storage is not nearly enough these days, and the price difference between the two models is insulting. 8 GB of flash costs practically nothing. I would happily pay $250 for 8GB built-in with a MicroSD slot. Hopefully, Asus will continue their original plan and ship the MeMo 370.</p>
<p>a lot of vegetarians here farting around</p>
<p>What gives? This review and many others quote WiFi on this tablet as being 802.11b/g/n but the Google Play Store (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_7_8gb</a>) says 802.11a/b/g/n. Does it have 802.11a or not?</p>
<p>oh god, please let it be  802.11a. I just got the Asus Black Diamond dual band router and nothing to use on the 5Ghz band.</p>
<p>I wrote a blog post on this topic:</p>

<p>like Mildred said I&#8217;m surprised that any one can make $9183 in four weeks on the internet. have you seen this web link(Click on menu Home more information)     <a href="http://goo.gl/7XhkZ" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/7XhkZ</a></p>
<p>Mildred never said any such thing. LIAR!</p>
<p>Oh that&#8217;s cute.</p>
<p>Admittedly I am a WP7 user who loves my Ecosystem. Currently use a fire sale Touchpad with ICS . I do enjoy it. This makes me want this tablet although I will be getting a Surface upon release. Goodjob Googs</p>
<p>One thing I have to say about Google is that they are good at learning how to make their products fundamentally better. Maybe at the same level as Apple. Ever since the Fire came out, it was obvious to anyone with a brain that Google had to focus on the ecosystem in their tablets. And they did it. This deserves to be a success. Let&#8217;s see if it will become one.</p>
<p>a 7 for Eco System?</p>
<p>must be a joke&#8230;</p>
<p>dont get me wrong, i will probably buy one, but 7 for a tablet eco system that doesnt exist is shameful</p>
<p>Yep. I want one. And I have two iPads already. I&#8217;ve always been interested in Android, but never enough to justify spending the money. But for 200 bucks, I don&#8217;t have to do much justification. This looks like it&#8217;s exactly the Android device I&#8217;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>my thoughts exactly</p>
<p>This is the first Android device I actually can see myself buying. If it&#8217;s ever released in my region.</p>
<p>As expected from another device in the great Nexus series.</p>
<p>I love reading such well written reviews. Glad to hear the Nexus 7 impresses too, I&#8217;d much rather there be multiple great tablet options, rather than just one. I mean, I love my iPad 3, but I may want to try something different at some point lol.</p>
<p>The Asus Transformer Prime is pretty good or otherwise the Asus Transformer Infinity with HD screen.</p>
<p>Sure would like to watch the Video Review, but I am greeted by pink video artifacts obscuring everything.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s two in a row. Joshua Topolsky is now a certified Google fanboy :-)</p>
<p>Go read his iPad reviews and you&#8217;ll know he&#8217;s not :)</p>
<p>JT on Galaxy Nexus:<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the best smartphones ever made&#8230; and it could be the best ever &quot;</p>
<p>JT on Nexus 7:<br />
&#8220;This isn’t just an excellent tablet for $200, It’s an excellent tablet, period &quot;</p>
<p>Just sayin&#8230;:-)</p>
<p>Lol, true. Seriously though, read his iPad reviews and it&#8217;s like he&#8217;s watching the savior walk on water. Burning water even!</p>
<p>Yes, but he is not leading with his opinion of iPad. I know of institutions (not individual consumers) that want to buy iPad by the hundreds or thousands (seriously).   We all know of the iPad sucess story. However, to claim best in class or at least a solid contender in class, with little to no uptake by end users is a sure sign of a fan.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s that 40% (probably more) of apple consumers that don&#8217;t even look at other products, android will always be the underdog, doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s worse, Josh doesn&#8217;t let that sway his opinion is all and i thank him for it</p>
<p>Can he not love both? I myself own both a Galaxy Nexus and an Iphone 4s. I love them both and they&#8217;re both excellent, but for different reason. And praising something that isn&#8217;t necessarily at the forefront of popular opinion isn&#8217;t fanboyism,. It&#8217;s appreciation of a product.</p>
<p>Android here I come!</p>
<p>I wonder if Google will advertise this device. If not then I doubt they will actually sell that many of these.</p>
<p>This tablet will definitely beat The Kindle Fire and Nook.  Blows em out of the water.  Props to Google for a good tablet.  But its not a iPad and no way compares to The New iPad.  Retina display all the way!</p>
<p>This obviously isn&#8217;t meant to compete with the iPad, and if you would use a little bit of deductive reasoning, you could have come up with that yourself. Instead, you chose the path of ignorance.</p>
<p>You android fanatics are funny.  Mean SOBs to the end lol</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how pointing out your obvious logical flaws is mean. I&#8217;m simply trying to help you be a better human being. Hundreds of millions of years of evolution gave you one of the most sophisticated tools to observe the world around you, and you choose to waste it away by spewing somebody else&#8217;s unoriginal garbage.</p>
<p>as someone who owns the new ipad w/retina display, meh it&#8217;s ok, not a game changer though</p>
<p>16GB version already pre-ordered, can&#8217;t wait until mid-July!</p>
<p>So has anyone heard anything about Nexus 7 supporting MHL or some sort of screen mirroring/ Video output? I talked to a Nexus Rep and he said that it supports it at the Hardware level but that is the only source I&#8217;ve heard that says It supports it.</p>
<p>MEH&#8230;it&#8217;s JUST another Andriod tablet.  FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Norway is VERY pissed about not having &#8220;Project Butter&#8221; in their Android 4.1&#8217;s&#8230; <br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub0GzU56YMA" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub0GzU56YMA</a></p>
<p>Okay one thing I think that should be corrected is that the tablet is *Designed and also Made by Asus.  I thought this was evident in the interviews that Asus/Google has had &#8211; they clearly pointed towards Asus developing it with Google giving feedback, not Google designing it.  Just want to say because we should give credit to Asus here, they seem have done well with the back side design, given the price.</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t find a list of the ports this thing has.  Does it have mini-USB?   Does it have a headphone jack?</p>
<p>How did you arrive at the 8.8 score when your totals add up to 62 which divided by 8 = 7.75? Just curious!</p>
<p>you can do this with all of their reviews, i don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s like this, i would kind of like an explanation my self</p>
<p>&#8220;[I]n most cases, the final score is an average of those subscores — yes, even down to the decimal point. However, since it is not a weighted average, the editor reserves the right to adjust the average to better reflect the overall assessment of the product, including how the price fits.&#8221;</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>well, the score chart is missing one major factor: price (or total cost, or value).</p>
<p>in this case the 7 would score a 10, since it clearly offers the most at its market price level. and that would bring the score up a full point to exactly 8.8.</p>
<p>If only it has 3G.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m what you might call an Apple fanboy, but I have no trouble calling this the best Android tablet so far and I predict it will also become the best selling Android tablet ever, dwarfing the sales of the Kindle Fire.<br />
Finally the hardware quality+OS user experience+price point comes together to make for an all-round appealing product. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how and if Apple will respond.</p>
<p>Best to ignore all the iSheep comments,,, they are cultists and have blinders on&#8230; some are now panicking..it&#8217;s funny and sad at the same time<br />
Nice to see Google going for a price point and decent product. I have an iPad 3 .. which after 3 months sits on the coffee table,,, thinking of buying an iPad Duster for it&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like your post is just from a reservoir of troll posts where you selected one, then copied and pasted it to the forum.</p>
<p>This tablet is performant, handsome and is useable with one hand. Plus, it&#8217;s affordable, what makes me crazy ..</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kinda searching for a use-case to buy this tablet.<br />
Personally, I can&#8217;t find a situation in which I would like to use a tablet. Why?</p>
<p>At home; I don&#8217;t watch TV, I am in front of my notebook. And, I am also not reading books, shame on me.<br />
Outside; I am not using trains or busses. I use my car.</p>
<p>So, please tell me a use-case for this tablet, so I can buy it&#8230;</p>
<p>Are you serious? If this is just a shot at the Nexus 7 from an Apple fanboy, then I can&#8217;t convince you. Otherwise there are plenty of situations, for myself at least, where I could use this tablet.</p>
<p>First, if you read a lot and don&#8217;t like touching dirty library books where thousands of people touch them, you can save a ton of money with this. Download some kindle files and the kindle app and boom, free books that never rip or tear.(this doesn&#8217;t apply to you because you don&#8217;t read but if you ever start)</p>
<p>-  when you are at the mall waiting for your GF when she is trying on clothes.<br />
- when you are waiting for your car to be serviced and oil changes<br />
- when kids are getting a haircut<br />
- when waiting in your car for someone just pull it out if the glove box<br />
- when you want to lie down on bed but can&#8217;t leave your notebook and notebook is too heavy to lift over your head.</p>
<p>Trust me though, once you get a tablet, it is so much more convenient than the notebook it is crazy. I only use my laptop for excel, word, and photoshop know. Everything the tablet is just so much better. I currently use an iPad but this applies for any tablet.</p>
<p>yea, i remember when i got the 1st ipad i almost took it back because i kept telling myself &#8220;why did i get this, i don&#8217;t know what to use it for&#8221;, but eventually it was easy since i travel a lot, using my ipad on an airplane to watch movies second to none (especially if you have some sweet bose noise canceling headphones) and also when you are on the couce/bed it is the best medium for surfing the web and the like, whereas with your laptop you either have to turn your body or put it on your lap, not very comfortable, and your smartphone is way too small).</p>
<p>i have to admit you do have to force yourself to start using it and it&#8217;s features, but once you actually do you won&#8217;t want to go back</p>
<p>Great review !!!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d buy this as it looks an excellent piece of kit, may even give my iPad 2 a well deserved rest.</p>
<p>Nexus 7 y u no video out?! :P otherwise looks pretty awesome for a cheap tablet.</p>
<p>the 7 is the first really good 7&quot; tablet from anyone, and the price has been set at the absolute no-profit minimum. so now the big question is, just how big a market is there for that &#8216;tweener size, period? we&#8217;ll find out this year &#8230;</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m reading this review, I&#8217;m not entirely sure if you were providing us with a review or if you were marketing this device to us. Just kidding. That being said&#8230; Thank you Josh. I&#8217;m sold! I&#8217;m actually gonna pre-order one right now. This is the tablet that I&#8217;ve always been waiting for. iOS is not for me and all the previous Android tablets have been such disappointments. But this! This one right here is the one. Thanks again Josh.   =)</p>
<p>I would be an extra $100 for hdmi out functionality. This hurts. I was so about to buy this too.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why people are so keen on having HDMI or any other video output on this device. Most phones these days have HML ports, and removable storage, so if you have a phone then you&#8217;re already set. If not, there are a variety of cheaper ways to get media from a device to a television. Most DVD or Bluray players have external USB ports that can read a wide variety of drives from external HDDs, to SSDs, thumb drives and even tablets and phones that act like plug and play drives. Then there&#8217;s always a Roku box, Google TV, Apple TV, Xbox 360, PS3, and even cheap media center computers, all with plenty of capabilities.</p>
<p>In essence, anywhere you go with a device, there should be one or more ways to display your media on a television without the need for a tablet with video output.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m far more likely to use video out on a device like this than my phone.  Usually the last thing I want is for my phone to be tethered to something when it needs to be able to receive calls, texts, notifications, etc.  Having video out would&#8217;ve been a nice feature.  It&#8217;s not a deal breaker for me especially not for $200, though.</p>
<p>I understand what you&#8217;re saying I really do.  And believe me I was considering trading my Nexus S in for a Galaxy Nexus. The problem is I would still want to use my phone when I&#8217;m watching TV (Sling player)  As it stands now, I have not seen an android device that is reasonably priced (Maybe the Prime) with TV out that can provide a high quality experience + tvout functionality. The issue with the prime I have been reading is that with the ICS update, there have been some issues with tvout.  None of those devices you&#8217;ve listed provides me slingplayer tvout ability. (Apple TV did at one point, but for local access, not remote access).  So that is my dilemma.</p>
<p>Also I already have a PC in my bedroom and I would like something more portable/multipurpose in my living room to use for the function.</p>
<p>Any word on when is this coming to international markets (Mexico, for instance)?</p>
<p>Think this is worth getting if you already have a  VZ Galaxy Nexus?</p>
<p>I have a VZW GN and I just got one.</p>
<p>Google/Apple/Microsft/Samsung without competition is a sad world that I hope never to see. Like with any corporations, they gain market share and play defense which means no innovations.</p>
<p>No microSD is a joke.</p>
<p>There are other alternatives to expandable storage.</p>
<p>It costs pennies to implement and there&#8217;s clearly space.</p>
<p>Tell that to the millions upon millions of iPad owners, Galaxy Nexus/S, HTC One owners.</p>
<p>What do you need microSD for nowadays? Everything is stored in the cloud? You can use microSD if you want slower read/write speeds.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t use the cloud on the go.   I thought this was obvious for a wifi only device.</p>
<p>Josh, did you seriously gave a &#8220;7&#8221; score to the ecosystem?<br />
Sorry, fantastic review in all, but this is a joke!</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;7&#8221; in battery life? Wait WUT?<br />
Reading the review, I would expect at least an &#8220;8&#8221; (if not 9) in battery life&#8230; and maybe a &#8220;6&#8221; score in ecosystem&#8230;</p>
<p>Be happy they didn&#8217;t give it a 6 like usually.</p>
<p>Yeah, the iPad has the best selection of apps and the most support. But I want a tablet and this one is half as much as the iPad 2 and $300 less than the new iPad, which it&#8217;s more comparable to as far as internals go. It&#8217;s just not worth an extra $2-300 for a few better apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few&#8221;&#8230; Yeah sure.</p>
<p>For most users, there&#8217;s almost no difference between the applications you can get for iOS and the ones you can get for Android. Yes, iOS has a lot more applications, but to be honest, do users need thousands of fart apps to choose from? Do they need thousands of the same types of puzzle games, or platformer knockoffs, or Atari-style tilt games? Do you really need over a hundred different Twitter clients, dozens of free digital leveling tools or compasses? No.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the average smartphone and tablet user frequently uses (3 or more times a week) less than 20 applications. They also only use a handful of applications on a daily basis. In other words, with iOS, you get a lot of crap to wade through so you can find something of quality, and in all likelihood it will be $1.99 for the phone version, and $4.99 for the tablet version (which has no added content, just more screen real estate).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of funny really. You pay more for an iPad so you can pay even more for applications for that iPad.</p>
<p>I disagree, there are some high quality apps for iOS that are not available for Android, many provided by Apple themselves (Google doesn&#8217;t seem to be writing the same types of client apps, perhaps it isn&#8217;t their core strength). Pages,  iPhoto, Garageband, Keynote are great, polished apps not available for Android. Sure there are apps that do the same general things, but that isn&#8217;t what&#8217;s being debated here- it&#8217;s apps that are as professionally designed and high quality.</p>
<p>I also think you&#8217;re also way behind the curve on universal apps for iOS.  I&#8217;d say wading through the crap is even harder on Android because it&#8217;s more difficult to even find an app in a given category that actually looks OK on a tablet sized display.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I want a tablet and this one is half as much as the iPad 2 and $300 less than the new iPad&#8221;</p>
<p>WTF? Who thinks like this?!</p>
<p>Nice hardware, and Android is getting better. However, it is lacking in tablet specific apps. Google better watch their back because Microsoft is right behind you. So Google, pull your finger out.</p>
<p>I feel Google should have 3G variant as well(say $350) else all the talk of Google Now seems gimmick .. How would Google Notify me about the next train or delay in flight without Internet?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but my Android phone has a native WiFi hotspot toggle. For no additional cost to me, I can switch on my phone&#8217;s hotspot and use its data connection for any device I have handy. That makes a WiFi only version of any tablet much more appealing to me. I really feel sorry for people who use AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>My point was that it would be a complete package. Like I am generally using Iphone then I may not be able to always tether. Also for my work I cannot use my mobile battery to make WIFI hotspot as I have to use it for other purpose, it is costly affair for me. In Singapore 3G is better affair and we get extra sim for tablets for same data plan.</p>
<p>That would be nice to get an extra SIM card so we could use multiple devices on the same plan in America, I have to admit. I can see why you&#8217;d want 3G capability.</p>
<p>And also there is a use case &#8211; What if it is my first Smart device? Which I want to use for everything that phone does except calling and clicking pictures, I mean I am sure Google is well aware than what I am.</p>
<p>This would be a lot better with a cellular radio.  A lot of the features on this is useful for when you&#8217;re on the go.</p>
<p>Not only did they directly compete with their partners, but they are selling this at cost.  This is like MS giving away an internet browser back when everyone else was actually selling theirs for real money.</p>
<p>There is one tablet market, with a finite amount of dollars consumers have to spend in it. Every sale of one tablet not only takes away from sale of a competitor&#8217;s tablet…it also takes away a customer for the foreseeable future as the vast majority will likely never leave the competitors ecosystem .</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone attempting to claim they don’t care about a subset of that easily scaleable tablet market, are ignorant of reality (posters) or putting on a Public Relation stunt until they enter it under guise of not entering it (Apple, reduced price of ipad 2).</p>
<p>In addition, getting a foothold in 7&quot; is hugely important for when a 10&quot; nexus is released and when such 7&quot; users go to buy their next tablet.</p>
<p>Which leads to my next point in resposne to everyone who has posted it or is even thinking it… almost no one is likely to switch once they begin down the ios or Android path, as they become to heavily invested in hardware, software and accessories&#8230; so spare us of all the irrelevant statements implying the competitor’s os or hardware is just not good enough for you to switch. This is a fight for those new to the ecosystems-first time purchasers.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain to me the point of a tablet without 3G?Can anyone explain to me the point of a tablet that has no 3G and hence no</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t pay $50-$100 extra plus another contract and tether it thru your phone when you need access<br />
Isn&#8217;t too difficult to understand</p>
<p>The point is I have an iPad 3 with 3G and almost never use 3G. Maybe it&#8217;s special circumstances &#8211; I have a pre-paid 3G card and also an iPhone with tethering + 3G plan so I <strong>could</strong> tether. But I got the 3G because I thought that would be inconvenient. As it turns out, the vast majority of places I use my iPad have WiFi.</p>
<p>The other reason is, it&#8217;s $200.</p>
<p>I rarely/never use 3g for data on my phone.</p>
<p>I`m rarely/never anywhere without WiFi.</p>
<p>This tablet would work just fine for me.</p>
<p>Couple of things wrong with this review<br />
1. Trouble streaming to nexus Q<br />
Nexus Q stream from the play store, not the device we&#8217;re using right now. So if you have trouble with your internet connection in streaming HD content to nexus 7, of course it will happen to nexus Q who share the same connection<br />
2. Lack of tablet apps, twitter as example?<br />
This is twitter fault not updating their apps for tablet and it&#8217;s not a good example, as there&#8217;s other twitter apps that is optimise for tablet like plume and tweetcaster. Don&#8217;t judge the ecosystem just because few apps developer is lazy to update it for tablet. Especially facebook and twitter who view do not focus their effort of their apps on android. That&#8217;s why most of people use alternative social apps for facebook and tweeter.</p>
<p>There is a reason iOS has the most apps and most frequently updated too. Priority for iOS is always #1 and after that there&#8217;s not much money to create/update Android versions.</p>
<p>I heard iOS just got its millionth fart app. Congratulations!</p>
<p>Android has more &#8220;fart&#8221; apps.  Remember, there isn&#8217;t much of anything keeping an app out of the Android Market.  Which is why it&#8217;s so much easier for a developer to put a straight up piece of malware on it.   Apple hasn&#8217;t allowed generic &#8220;fart apps&#8221; for a while.</p>
<p>The fact that you even bring up malware shows just how ignorant you are.</p>
<p>The fact that you call someone ignorant after making a troll post about a &#8220;millionth fart app&#8221; shows how ignorant <em>you</em> are.</p>
<p>honestly, not many people care about twitter and facebook official apps. Facebook official apps is slow as turtle. Most of us is just better off using the altenatives. Friendcaster (that has been optimize for 4.0), tweetcomb (twitter app for tablet), tweetcaster, tweetdeck, twicca etc. There&#8217;s ton of alternative.</p>
<p>Mostly I am thrilled that Google has finally realized what a laggy POS Android is, and is doing something about it.</p>
<p>If you own an iPhone and play around with any Android phone in the mall, the one thing that immediately stands out, like in the first 3 seconds of using the device, is how animations are kind of stuttering. Pre-iOS that may have been acceptable. Post-iOS, it certainly isn&#8217;t. It stands out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>So now they have Duarte, and apparently some people from a gaming background to fix the FPS. Even if it&#8217;s not perfect in Android 4.1, it will be soon thereafter. <strong>That</strong> is the exciting takeaway for me. Android will be a competitor. I&#8217;ll be able to look at Android phones and seriously consider them as an alternative.</p>
<p>I know &#8212; forget functionality and whatnot &#8212; <em>how smoothly does your home screen scroll</em>? That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s important here. If your homescreens don&#8217;t scroll smoothly, you&#8217;re just holding trash in your hand.</p>
<p>Second most important &#8212; how pretty do your icons look?</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much useful functionality you put into a piece of consumer electronics; if it&#8217;s awkward and uncomfortable to use, people will look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Pre-iOS feature phones were actually more functional than the first iPhone, but they were almost without exception a nightmare to use.</p>
<p>Kudos to Google for realising that they&#8217;re selling primarily to consumers, where this stuff is at least as important as functionality.</p>
<p>yah because the ui smoothness or lack there of, is only on the homescreen!</p>
<p>can anyone tell me if a camera is supported via the USB OTG on the Nexus 7?  it would be great to use as a microscope or for some augmented reality apps.  I know keyboards and mice have been tried.</p>
<p>I have an ipad 2, that&#8217;s great for most things, but only OK for Text; I also have a Kindle Keyboard (no light); should I buy this Nexus 7, maybe for reading books at night, for the gps?  Can I stream movies from my PC to it?  I need your opinion&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t talk about the Nexus 7, but for me, going from iPad1 to iPad3 has made an enormous difference. I read loads of PDFs and the higher ppi makes that a much, much better experience.</p>
<p>There are multiple video apps that can stream from PC in multiple file formats including mkv and avi.</p>
<p>I liked the 7&quot; form factor for reading books on the couch, but not in bed &#8212; I found it fatiguing holding it in one hand while lying down since there&#8217;s no lap to brace it on. I use my GS2 for bedtime reading.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used my 7&quot; Galaxy Tab since I bought the Asus Transformer Prime. But the GTab only has 1024 X 600 resolution. The Nexus 7 has the same resolution as my Transformer Prime, so I&#8217;m curious as to which one I&#8217;d prefer after long term use.</p>
<p>For reading at night, I&#8217;d suggest the Kindle lighted cover.  It&#8217;s not perfect &#8211; there&#8217;s a brightness gradient from the top-right to bottom-left &#8211; but I still find it far easier on the eyes than a backlit LCD.</p>
<p><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/02/kindle/shasta/covers/images/cover_lighted_handheld._V186791130_.jpg" /></p>
<p>Ok, please someone correct me, I really think this could not be. If you sum all numbers and divide by 8, you don&#8217;t get 8.8, you get 7.8</p>
<p>(8+8+6+8+9+9+7+7) / 8</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%288%2B8%2B6%2B8%2B9%2B9%2B7%2B7%29+%2F+8" target="_blank">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%288%2B8%2B6%2B8%2B9%2B9%2B7%2B7%29+%2F+8</a></p>
<p>well do you really think a camera score should be as equally weighted as performance in a tablet? probably not.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 is the best Android tablet, I&#8217;m just talking about the score, its the sum of all score divided by 8</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>How many times are people going to make a comment like this before they realize there are rules, you can even find them at the end of the article!</p>
<p>My fault, I read the rules just now. <br />
It says: &#8220;the are no rules, we just give points based on our secret though.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was, a bigger surprise for me.</p>
<p>Why is there a &#8220;Camera(s)&#8221; score category on tablets? Is that just to justify giving it a lower score? You already do that every every android device ever made in the &#8220;Ecosystem&#8221; category. In the article it even says shame on you if you use a tablet to take pictures, but you still include a low camera score&#8230; Well, that shouldn&#8217;t surprise me.</p>
<p>Agreed &#8230; a camera is always a secondary thought on a tablet.</p>
<p>The math wrong. It not 8.8, its 7.8 (8+8+6+8+9+9+7+7) / 8</p>
<p>7.75 to be exact</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s helpful if you do your research before you post. They can give a product any score they want to.</p>
<p>The grammar wrong.</p>
<p>You know when you see that an article has &gt;1000 comments that there&#8217;s a big Apple Vs something\everything else war going on&#8230;</p>
<p>I think it would be a rarity for any comments on a tech news site not to degrade into Apple versus Google drivel, no matter the amount of posts nor the content of the article.</p>
<p>I really love the 7&quot; form factor. I was an Asus Transformer TF101 since launch and i have only used 4gb out of the 16gb that i have available. It&#8217;s a great tablet but I think I&#8217;d prefer a smaller, faster, and prettier tablet. I&#8217;m going to either sell it or trade it in for the N7.</p>
<p>Best Android app for streaming from my NAS?? Someone please recommend!!!</p>
<p>Dice Player Free can do it all and is the best media player I&#8217;ve used, but with one caveat &#8212; it holds your network password in clear text if you have folder security enabled.</p>
<p>ES File Explorer and MX Player. Map your NAS shares as a LAN server in ES File Explorer. Simple and works amazingly well on a local network.</p>
<p>So how exactly is this better/different than Sammy&#8217;s 7incher?  That&#8217;s a sweet piece of kit also.  As a KF user I&#8217;m really leaning towards a larger form factor next go-around, don&#8217;t like the shape of crApples pad, maybe wait for the Surface to come out.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t even a tablet.  It&#8217;s a big phone or an lcd ereader.</p>
<p>Using this wildly intelligent reasoning, EVERY tablet is just a big phone or lcd ereader.</p>
<p>The best feature of this tablet, stock android without any 3rd party skin or stupid manufacture apps. You also sure to get quick OS updates in this device.</p>
<p>Reminds me of another&#8230;. nah,,.. forget it&#8230; crazy talk</p>
<p>I have to say I&#8217;m surprised by this tablet as well and I think I would probably agree with this review on the whole (if I had one to play with) and believe me coming from an Apple o Microsoft fan and a genuine Anti-Android voice, Jellybean seems to be the first of the OS where they&#8217;ve started putting some of themselves into the OS&#8217; features. For me it still doesn&#8217;t address the main issue enough: Security.</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t vet any of its apps unlike MS and Apple, making each of them a potential piece of malware. I know you can stick to the bigger, more trusted names, but what about up and coming genuine studios and app developers that then can&#8217;t be trusted because they&#8217;re not as well known. If they sort out issues like these (and please don&#8217;t say that there is android anti-malware software out there, because you shouldn&#8217;t require anti-malware on a mobile platform)  and they innovate some of their own original ideas into the OS and stop simply (trying to) improve other peoples ideas, I will feel comfortable recommending the OS &#8211; given that the issues Joshua has raised such as the flailing tablet app market for android are addressed also.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, a dodgy looking piece of software is usually dodgy. This isn&#8217;t exclusive to Android or mobile phones or anything. If something both looks too good to be true, and seems dodgy, it probably is.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get why so many seem to whine over no HDMI and no microSD slot? It&#8217;s a $200 tablet for crying out loud and to complain is spec snobbery true to form. Google won&#8217;t placate to a spec snob&#8217;s desire to be a digital hoarder you know (sounds like an inevitable spin off of A&amp;E&#8217;s Hoarders, eh?). There&#8217;s no logical reason why someone would require a tablet to be capable of keeping an exhaustive local library of every jam, flick, pic and PDF he or she has ever come across. It&#8217;s looney, impractical and blatantly ignorant of the ginormous <em>cloud</em> that hangs over head.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a question for the spec snob: Since when did a tablet become the primary media center? As far as I know, it hasn&#8217;t, and it never will be. At most, it&#8217;s for watching short clips and occasionally a movie perhaps when you&#8217;re on a plane, train or bus. I know I like to watch &#8220;my stories&#8221; comfortably on a legit TV screen where it makes sense. If I need to get real work done, I have a pretty slick laptop in arms&#8217; reach (I&#8217;m sure not going to edit a PowerPoint on a 7-inch tablet through some hacky Polaris Office app).</p>
<p>I read once somewhere tablets are pretty much a sofa companion. Show of hands: anyone agree (my hand is up by the way)? It&#8217;s my Roku remote when I can&#8217;t find my actual Roku remote, it&#8217;s what I use to look up Shark Tank contestants in mid-episode so I can learn right then if they&#8217;re still kicking, and it&#8217;s much more to me. But to say I&#8217;m enjoying my tablet and not criticizing the very medium that doesn&#8217;t meet some asinine criteria would be an absolute true statement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to enjoy what smarter people than us have created, dearest spec snob. Google Play, Spotify, Amazon and others have a cutesy, cartoony clouds for you to wiggle your stubby fingers through. Go on, try it! Feels good, right? Let them worry about your storage &#8212; don&#8217;t live in fear of &#8220;what if&#8221; scenarios for not getting to your goods. We have reliable vendors and reliable connections and eventually one or the other will go down, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world, and it&#8217;s time to make peace with the fact that nothing&#8217;s perfect &#8212; not even the tablet.</p>
<p>I have more thoughts on the spec snob via Technorati. <a href="http://technorati.com/technology/android/article/plight-of-the-spec-snob-why/" target="new">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>A pompous post about snobs? Also, completely specious post. Your expectations and needs do not extend through the rest of the world, no matter what your mama told you.</p>
<p>Renting movies and firing them out through a TV is handier on a tablet than a dirty old laptop.</p>
<p>Finally a computer voice that doesn&#8217;t sound like Stephen Hawking! What took them so long?</p>
<p>Better question yet, why hasn&#8217;t anyone updated Stephen Hawkings voice emulator?? He is only one of the greatest minds of the last century&#8230;.. Apple/ Google get on it!</p>
<p>I just purchased mine &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>To anyone that has 1 I would like to know what the web browsing experience is like because I know that is what I will be using it for the most. Just curious to know how well it loads heavy pages, how well does it load the Verge?</p>
<p>ok.. i&#8217;ve searched online several times but can&#8217;t find any info on live wallpaper support for the nexus 7.. can someone please provide any insight? does it have live wallpaper support and if so anyone care to share what the jellybean live wallpapers look like?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.droid-life.com/2012/07/03/jelly-bean-live-wallpaper-brings-a-taste-of-android-4-1-to-all-devices/">JB Live Wallpaper.</a></p>
<p>Since it was announced at Google I/O I&#8217;ve been looking at the ordering page and just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it&#8230;. until an hour ago!</p>
<p>I love Google, but I really hate how it doesn&#8217;t serve Play Store in my country (Singapore)!</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t those soft buttons eventually burn into the screen? I used to think LCD&#8217;s can&#8217;t get burn in but after reading my new TV&#8217;s manual, I guess its possible?</p>
<p>LCDs can&#8217;t get &#8220;burn in&#8221; by definition. What people refer to as &#8220;burn in&#8221; on LCD screens is when the pixels cannot return to their &#8220;relaxed&#8221; state. It&#8217;s present in every type of electronic device to some degree.</p>
<p>However, the screens on most devices are static enough that if burn in happened  frequently, you would hear about it all the time. It is very rare for an LCD screen to experience this problem before the screen itself just dies.</p>
<p>This is one of those devices that I really want but don&#8217;t &#8220;need&#8221;. Normally I throw the word &#8220;need&#8221; around a lot but in this instance I think I might keep it in reserve because I already own a Nexus mobile device (Nexus S), and at this point I really don&#8217;t feel like I need a bigger more powerful version of my phone. Although I must say, if I had cash to splurge with I&#8217;d pick one of these up. It&#8217;s gorgeous!</p>
<p>All Amazon needs to do is come out with an upgaded Kindle Fire 2 device and they keep the lead again just based on content ecosystem.  It is becoming a very competitive tablet landscape for sure.   I am not sure the iPad is not a lesser device now compared to this new Google Nexus.  I still prefer the Microsoft Surface Pro to this without a doubt though.  The Kindle Fire, Nexus 7 and to some extent the iPad are toys compared to the Surface.</p>
<p>you prefer an unreleased product with no price or specs?  instead of two real tangible products one of which is the market leader and has a much better eco system?</p>
<p>you&#8217;re probably the same guy that &#8220;preferred&#8221; the zune when it was announced too.</p>
<p>Too bad I just got myself a Kindle Fire.</p>
<p>I seriously can&#8217;t wait to get one of these. This review has definitely made my decision for getting seem like an even better choice.</p>
<p>I will be getting a surface I think</p>
<p>Does Nexus 7 support any kind of video out? Most importantly does it support tv-out via 3.5mm﻿ jack like Galaxy S or Nokia N95 etc, can you check with a 3.5mm-to-rca cable plz?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really like tablets, to me are useless, I really prefer to wait the Microsoft Surface pro. But what I really like that android will screw apple xD.  (Sorry for my english)</p>
<p>guess you&#8217;ll be disappointed then because in no way will this tablet &#8220;screw&#8221; apple.</p>
<p>Who wants to buy my kindle fire?</p>
<p>How does the Verge come up with the final score?  Based on the breakdown, it got a couple of 9&#8217;s, three 8&#8217;s, and the rest are 7&#8217;s and 6&#8217;s, so how is the final score an 8.8?  Is it a weighted average?  IMO, that&#8217;s a pretty high score for a tablet that, while provides very good value in terms of price/performance, doesn&#8217;t bring anything new to the table in terms of design, materials or cutting edge features.  And while Google did a nice job with JB, they still haven&#8217;t addressed the apps issue.  Unless they can get devs to get on board with tablet optimized apps, what&#8217;s the incentive for smartphone owners to spend $200 to run the same apps on a screen that&#8217;s only a couple of inches bigger than their phones?</p>
<p>Cause its  not a big deal to scale up on a 7 inch device and keep a nice resolution? Blame the devs not google. They have access to the tools needed</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand.. this is a week-old story at this point. Why is it still listed under &#8220;breaking&#8221; at the top of the page?</p>
<p>not sure if anyone else has come across this yet (very relevant for buyers in the uk); google has failed to strike deals with television networks &amp; magazine publishers <em>which is also the main reason why amazon abandoned their plans for a worldwide launch of its kindle fire.</em><br />

<p>anyways, i&#8217;ve already pre-ordered mine and will also be getting one for my dad :)</p>
<p>10:27 &#8230; awesome bug on the table!</p>
<p>UBM Techinsights have done their teardown and are mentioning a resistive screen?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ubmtechinsights.com/google-nexus-7-teardown/" target="_blank">http://www.ubmtechinsights.com/google-nexus-7-teardown/</a></p>
<p>ELAN Microelectronics eKTF3624BWS – Controller for Resistive Touchscreen<br />
ELAN Microelectronics eKTH1036BWS – Controller for the Resistive Touchscreen</p>
<p>What is going on? Is this not a capacitative screen? The specs don&#8217;t actually say.</p>
<p>Might be a typo on their side, or some misunderstanding. Basically, resistive screens are soft (since you need to press the upper layer down to make contact with the lower one, to register touch) and allow no multi-touch. The Nexus 7&#8217;s screen is definitely capacitative.</p>
<p>Oh Jushua, shut up about the &#8220;no tablet apps&#8221; for pets sake!   There isn&#8217;t supposed to be! There is supposed to be ONE app which adapts (not that hard under Android) The Apple idea of having different apps is just a greed move to get people to pay more than once.</p>
<p>I think the point here is indeed that most apps currently don&#8217;t adapt/scale properly, because there was no effort to have an interface suited to larger screens. Twitter&#8217;s a good example.</p>
<p>Actually, I think the question of phone apps vs tablet apps is interesting. It&#8217;s accepted that general software may need to be bought twice to run on different platforms because of the extra dev involved. With the seemingly unified OSs of iOS and Android, there&#8217;s now one platform but markedly different screen sizes. That didn&#8217;t exist before, besides for websites (but you don&#8217;t pay for these).</p>
<p>So with these new OSs, it would appear the bulk of the work is on the interface, not on the bolts and gears. Does it justify paying twice for the app? Hardly, I would say. A mid-way solution could be to charge only an extra for the other version, once the first one&#8217;s been bought, to recognise this work.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s still the question of what you actually download to your device. Its screen size won&#8217;t change, so you may want to optimise, e.g. by not downloading the super high-res data on your phone. That&#8217;s what we do with mobile websites. Yes, I&#8217;m thinking iPhone/iPad here, with the app size blowup due to the new display. Blurring the line on Android with all screen ratios and sizes from 4&quot; all the way to 13&quot; doesn&#8217;t help either. But then this means there still isn&#8217;t one unique app, but several versions of it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve read about it by now, but if you want to read another review by an IO attendee, look no further: <a href="http://michaelevans.org/blog/2012/07/03/nexus-7-review/">Nexus 7 Review</a></p>
<p>after watching this review, not sure what to get now. The iphone 5 or a phone with droid jelly bean?</p>
<p>Watch these Android vs. iOS videos, and you&#8217;ll see why you should get a phone with Jelly Bean. Maybe wait for the next Nexus phone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMiY1kSTHZw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMiY1kSTHZw</a></p>
<p>Well considering &#8216;droid&#8217; branded phones only exist at verizon, you wont be able to get any with jellybean for the forseeable future. Droid=certain android powered devices from verizon. Android=operating system. Nexus=google branded devices running vanilla versions of their android software</p>
<p>Droid devices have always had a sparkle. Especially into the tablet sector. My first droid was a smartphone&#8230;I remember, my good old HTC Wildfire. I was quite enchanted when I bought it, but well, in time I thought of changing it into something more fun and powerful. So, I thought of a tablet. Now, I was first tempted to purchase a Kindle Fire, because let&#8217;s say I am quite passionate about reading and investing into my cultural backgrounds and the price Amazon came up with was really really good ( price/ quality truly acceptable). I am reconsidering the deal after this review. I am thrilled what I&#8217;ve heard so far about Jelly Bean and the design is refined and more subtle than Kindle&#8217;s wrapping. I might take this into consideration! Thanks for this article! :)</p>
<p>We have had several Nexus 7&#8217;s now &#8211; all replacements for defective units &#8211; huge screen issues &#8211; see this small selection of YouTubes for the various types of screen problems -</p>

<p>Google might have wanted to establish some Quality Control SOPs with Asus &#8211;  before releasing this half-baked tablet on to the market</p>
<p>One mistake which a lot of people do is to compare the number of &#8216;tablet optimized&#8217; apps for iPad and Android tabs.</p>
<p>With a 7 inch tablet this problem is by far not as big as many would believe.</p>
<p>Most phone apps work fine on the nexus 7 AND the fact that android fits the phone app much better to the 7 inch size make the &#8216;problem&#8217; even less important.</p>
<p>Example: try a iphone app on an iPad, the results are horrible. If you scale the picture it&#8217;s extremely fuzzy, if not then you have a tiny window in the middle of the ipad screen. Both ways are terrible.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t happen with android, as the app is automatically fit to the whole tablet screen without scaling low res graphics. This might result in smaller font size sometimes but overall the result is leaps and bounds better than iPhone apps on an iPad&#8230;</p>
<p>Chrome for Android is also present as the stock browser on the Nexus 7, and it performs excellently on the device.  Yeah its great if you don&#8217;t want to watch videos on the verge, Engadget and many others. it says it doesn&#8217;t have flash installed but it works fine on iOS witch doesn&#8217;t have flash. so much for free and open.</p>
<p>Picked up one of these two days ago. It showed up in two days and is an excellent device. Play store works great and the integration with all your google accounts is flawless.</p>
<p>Very nice tablet. I luv Android :)</p>
<p>Thanks for the review.</p>

<p>Buying this tablet for Php 15.7k (around $379) tomorrow here in the PH grey market. It &#8217;s selling so well in the US i doubt it will available in our country anytime soon. :(</p>
<p>I have a Nexus 7 and i HIGHLY recommend it.<br />
Here are some nice tips for Nexus 7<br />

<p>Very balanced review, with all the details that are needed. I think the Nexus 7 is finally the much needed step Android had to take in order to get a foot into the tablet market. All other Android tablets up to now just didn&#8217;t get any relevant market share.</p>
<p>Some of my Nexus 7 impressions can be found here:</p>

<p>Absolutely love my Nexus 7 Tablet. Find out what I think of it here</p>

<p>I was excited about the Nexus until I read there was no SD card. It made me want to root a Nook Tablet.</p>
<p>the best tablet i tried so far, incredible fast, perfect size, jelly bean the best OS, happy as hell with the nexus 7</p>
<p>Google needs an iTunes-like service with a <span class="caps">HUGE</span> catalog&hellip; and it needs it now.<br />
That&rsquo;s basically the <span class="caps">ONLY</span> reason for me to keep considering Apple at the store.</p>
<p>Google <em>has</em> an iTunes like service. Can&rsquo;t speak to the catalog size (namely because everyone has a different idea about what constitutes &ldquo;huge&rdquo;, and no one does a real scientific comparison), but they at least have deals with all the major labels.</p>
<p>It might help you, but I doubt many people will switch because the library gets a little bigger. A subscription might do it, though.</p>
<p>WIth Play Music I can listen to more of my music on my friends iPhone than he can his music. It&rsquo;s beautiful cloud goodness.</p>
<p>Oh wow, I didn&#8217;t even realize that they had a mobile version for iOS. This is awesome.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t one, you have to use the web app.</p>
<p>There are a couple of 3rd party apps that work great. gmusic is one I believe.</p>
<p>Coming from someone who switched from Android to iOS, the Google Music apps suck. Google really needs to release a 1st party app.</p>
<p>Sure, they have an iTunes like service, in America. Sure as hell isn&rsquo;t in Canada, and neither is any statement of an estimated timeframe. This isn&rsquo;t a goddamn third world country, Google. Having basic access to a multimedia ecosystem is a core requirement for me from my mobile devices. Even Xbox Music run by those laggards at Microsoft have a fully functional service here.</p>
<p>like 10 people live there thou</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been announced in november, but for unknown reasons, it&rsquo;s been delayed.</p>
<p>I said it before, if Google brings Google Music to Canada, I&rsquo;ll change my ecosystem to Google completely.</p>
<p>Waiting game is beginnning to be frustrating.</p>
<p>Google music has everything that I&#8217;ve searched for. Their version of match is free too!</p>
<p>Also, the free song of the day is really nice. I download it every morning and get my groove on.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s stopping you? You can import your current library, and Google Play has a ton of music. If there&rsquo;s a couple artists not on Google Play, you can always buy their songs through iTunes then import them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there and it&rsquo;s great.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t bought from Apple in years.</p>
<p>Holy mother of URLs.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/music" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/music</a></p>
<p>Lol, that&rsquo;s a hell of a list for top albums. I enjoy Sublime but is a 17 year-old record topping the sales charts at Google Play? It might be even more hilarious that a 35 year-old record (News of the World) is at #9.</p>
<p>They were just on sale, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re on top.</p>
<p>The top selling album (Sublime) is $9.49. It&rsquo;s the same price on Amazon yet it is nowhere to be found on their top ten list. Amazon&rsquo;s top-ten list is more reflective of general music sales. The only outlier is Thriller which shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like very many people buy music from Google considering teenage girls are usually the main driver of music sales which is why pop chart lists are generally filled with garbage.</p>
<p>It was on sale, got downloaded a lot, and now is no longer on sale. That is what dongemus was saying.</p>
<p>The top chart usually is reflective of Apple&#8217;s or Amazon&#8217;s. I did notice this today and I had the exact same ashamed response.</p>
<p>I know they were vocally dissapointed with sales earlier this year, it&#8217;s probably still the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry! Music on Google Play is not available in your country yet.&rdquo;<br />
I&rsquo;m in Australia.</p>
<p>Yes, they need a fully fleshed version of Google Play Tunes. Most of the less tech informed people I know have little idea where/how to get their music onto the device. <br />
Google needs a complete, integrated solution to connect the devices to the desktop. Like 3 years ago.</p>
<p>YES. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this. Hope it&rsquo;s announced at I/O</p>
<p>Later this year, like October/November, is more likely. I/O this year will be all about Google&rsquo;s potentially huge Unified Messaging solution.</p>
<p>Google Music convinced me to start buying music. I uploaded all of my pirated music and realized I could stream it in high quality and download my collection from any location as many times as I wanted, so I have no excuse to pirate.</p>
<p>Though it turns out, buying music is expensive, so I can&#8217;t wait for this!</p>
<p>I wonder how long it will take Apple to finally launch their streaming.  It&#8217;s strange that they&#8217;re showing up after google.</p>
<p>Yeah, deleted all of my pirated music a few months ago. Spent nearly $200, and I still don&rsquo;t have as large of a library as I would like&hellip; but it feels good to pay for the content, and the service is really good.</p>
<p>I only rebought (or bought the new albums) from artists who are still alive. It definitely feels better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though it turns out, buying music is expensive, so I can&rsquo;t wait for this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In world where everything seems to have gone up 300% in price, music prices have actually gone down since the price gouging of CDs in the 90s where a CD could cost as much as $25. The prices are more similar to tapes.</p>
<p>Yeah, I listen to so much mainstream music that it&rsquo;s actually a lot cheaper to buy the music, especially when it goes on sale. I paid for Spotify, but then I wasn&rsquo;t using it.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;d be willing to pay up to $25 if I knew it was going almost entirely to the artist.</p>
<p>If you buy from bandcamp or cdbaby the bands get more of it, but signed bands are rarely on there.</p>
<p>I always try to see if they&#8217;re selling it directly from their site first. Sometimes I even buy the vinyl and mp3 or cd combo if it&#8217;s a band I really like, and I don&#8217;t even own a record player.</p>
<p>Kim Dotcom should be fixing that soon. If he doesn&rsquo;t get arrested first</p>
<p>if only&hellip;<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>I wonder, what would Google name this service?</p>
<p>Sadly, Wave would be a pretty good name. Unfortunately they wasted that on that service that did whatever it did.</p>
<p>It also means they don&#8217;t have to buy the name from someone else. It isn&#8217;t uncommon for companies to reuse product names. Microsoft has done this several times.</p>
<p>It would just be integrated into Google Music. I don&rsquo;t think it needs a separate name or anything.</p>
<p>I agree. It would basically be a added feature to the actual app where you might have a streaming music tab along with all the other tabs.</p>
<p>In the Android app, I guess you&rsquo;d just have &lsquo;All music&rsquo; &lsquo;On device&rsquo; and &lsquo;Streaming&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Which reminds me: the Google Play Music Android app (and Google Play in general) needs a huge revamp. Both the Play Store and Play Music apps are terrible on Android, and the web versions aren&rsquo;t a lot better.</p>
<p>Except the web stores only show a few related and also viewed lists. If you look at an application on the app, you can tell it to show all and it will produce many results.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the whole service needs a revamp.</p>
<p>The Android app is a disaster. It makes no sense whatsoever at any point. Really frustrating =/</p>
<p>Ron Amadeo from Android Police has attempted to fix it &ndash; he&rsquo;s rethemed the entire app, light and dark themes, and changed things around. It&rsquo;s awesome, but Ron can only do so much without the source code &ndash; the whole app needs rewriting.</p>
<p>I already use Spotfiy, and they have most of the stuff they search for. But Spotify is weird. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t find the original version of a song, but some unknown artist has uploaded a remix to it. They can&rsquo;t be legal ? Then their interface could use some work. You have to hunt for the web player.  And I can&rsquo;t take that green anymore.</p>
<p>If Google&rsquo;s interface is better and they have the same songs then I might switch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the three largest record labels, issued a report that indicated Google has not made good on a promise to lower the profile of accused pirate sites from its search rankings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">RIAA</span> said that sites repeatedly flagged for hosting pirated content were still appearing in Google searches for MP3s as much as they were before Google announced the plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These clowns really have no idea how Google works, or even how the internet works in general. Google can take down 100% of reported violators and more will spring up. Google can intentionally make it harder to find copyrighted material and yet Google users will just learn how to search smarter. Why do they even bother trying to play the blame game with Google on this?</p>
<p>Agreed.  They don&rsquo;t stand a chance here and shouldn&rsquo;t be blaming Google.</p>
<p>They know exactly how these services work. Google already remove huge numbers of search results, but they want the sites responsible for those links to be penalised by the Google Search algorithm.</p>
<p>Google, and the <span class="caps">RIAA</span> know that people rarely venture beyond page one of the results. Google also knows pirated content is popular (down to the number of minutes searching per user etc) and wants to maximise its ad revenues, so they don&rsquo;t change the algorithm to downgrade known pirate sites and force people onto another search engine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to need native last.fm scrobbling and then I&rsquo;d be pretty likely to sign up.  I pay $5 a month for Rdio on the browser right now so I&rsquo;d be happy to spend that money on a better product.</p>
<p>Does nobody else see the problem with the concept that one company sells you everything: OS, apps, and content?</p>
<p>It would only become a problem if every technology company under the sun were <span class="caps">NOT</span> striving for the same thing. As it stands now, you can pick and choose which services you want to use from as many different companies as you want to.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com">This isn&rsquo;t exactly new thing.</a></p>
<p>My grocery store sells plates, utensils,  food, and gas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really convenient and reliable! I&#8217;d be worried if they were the only ones selling plates, utensils,  food, and gas, but they&#8217;re not.</p>
<p>It only gets a Problem if you can only cook your Food with the gas you bought at the same store and if the plates would remove any Food from the wrong source straight to the trash can. We&rsquo;re not there at the moment but it&rsquo;s definitely the direction the industry is headed in.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m cautious, but I&#8217;m also reassured. Google has reached the size that I&#8217;m not interesting as an individual, and any violation of trust with its users would destroy the company. Google has too much to lose, so I believe they&#8217;ll act in their best interest, which should be my best interest. If that changes, they&#8217;ve made it easy for me to take my data with me and go somewhere else.</p>
<p>Perfectly said.</p>
<p>They should definitely integrate it into the current Google Play, and have a few tiers based on how much you use, with the songs that you already own not counting against your total. Maybe a basic free level that has only like 100 free plays a month or something?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love an ad-supported version similar to Pandora. Use the songs that I listen to the most to automatically suggest stations? I dunno, I&rsquo;m tired, but I feel like there&rsquo;s some way that Google could use the information that they have at their fingertips to improve upon the foundation Pandora&rsquo;s laid down.</p>
<p>That, and Pandora&rsquo;s a mess on Android. Close out the app? The &ldquo;Still Listening&rdquo; notification stays, have to re-open it and quit it through the menu. Gingerbread-esque UI. Memory hog. I cringe a bit everytime I use it. I only use it because it has songs I don&rsquo;t own, and, more importantly, it times out, so it&rsquo;s not still playing when I wake up.</p>
<p>You could try out Slacker, they recently updated their UI and it looks pretty good on my Nexus 7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Still Listening&rdquo; notification stays, have to re-open it and quit it through the menu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slacker has this same problem however.</p>
<p>So, is this kind of like Xbox Music then? I have an Xbox Music pass and the only artists I&rsquo;ve ever not found was The Beatles&hellip;which Apple has exclusive rights to. Competition is good, bring it on Google. Apple&rsquo;s stranglehold on the music industry at the moment isn&rsquo;t desirable, if Microsoft, Google, and others can chip away from it, we&rsquo;ll all gain.</p>
<p>The problem with Xbox music is that there is no way to get that music on other platforms right now.  Google does offer web apps for their Music service so chances are this subscription service will be available on all platforms as well.</p>
<p>Yeah your right. Although Microsoft did say they would eventually bring Xbox Music to Android and iOS. This was one of the major reasons I moved from Android to Windows Phone. The integrated Music Pass is just terrific.</p>
<p>Secretly hoping they buy Rdio</p>
<p>What about movies and shows? When are we going to see a Netflix competitor? I realize that&rsquo;s a much harder task, though.</p>
<p>YouTube is slowly becoming a Netflix competitor&hellip;if they (YT) can produce original, amazing content like House of Cards, and get TV shows and movies legally onto YouTube for a fee, they could easily compete. With the labels being as stubborn as they are, the latter part won&rsquo;t be easy, but it could be done.</p>
<p>Imagine having content as good as the BBC&rsquo;s <em>Sherlock</em> or <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> available exclusively YouTube, and you paid $10 p/month for it&hellip;that&rsquo;d be fantastic. If Google aren&rsquo;t aiming for that now, they should.</p>
<p>Remember a few weeks ago when they were rolling out a beta or something for subscription based channels? That&rsquo;s where this is heading, I think.</p>
<p>I think this is a great move for Google. But, tbh Microsoft is killing it in this arena for me personally. The Xbox Music pass (formerly Zune Music Pass) is an unbelievably great value. I&rsquo;ve tried all the services, Spotify, Rdio, Rhapsody, Mog. None of them seemed to really get the mobile part of the equation right. With my Xbox music pass and Windows Phone, the music integrates right into my phones native music player and downloads are seamless. Plus the desktop client works really well (on Windows only unfortunately). This was actually one of the reasons I left Android, so its smart of Google to consider this type of service.</p>
<p>I only hope that it won&rsquo;t be <span class="caps">USA</span> only</p>
<p>If Google can combine it with their Locker service, I will finally switch to a subscription music service. Until that happens, though, I will stick to my collection to the bitter end. There is just too much music in there that subscription services do not have (for example, rdio matched just 11,000 of the 18,000 tracks from my library)</p>
<p>Let me guess, this will be available exclusively in the <span class="caps">USA</span> for months/years, than gradually expand to countries that already have Google Music and in the followings decades/centuries to the rest of the world.&#65279;</p>
<p>Call me when it&rsquo;s available worldwide. For the time being, i can use iTunes in my country.</p>
<p>Needs to have a huge international footprint to rival iTunes, but could easily kill off the momentum of the existing streaming services without it. Interesting.</p>
<p>i spend at max maybe 30 dollars on music. If there was a subscription based service that was some where between 10-15 dollars that would turn that into 120-180 dollars annually. There really isnt anything else to say really. Its in the numbers. All the music is sitting on your servers anyway.</p>
<p>Anyone else&#8217;s mind go directly to Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24 Hour Bookstore?</p>
<p>Directly. I wonder if he got a look at this while he was working on the book?</p>
<p>maybe that means the Big Box is real too&#8230; ;)</p>
<p>This is really cool, I&#8217;ve always thought that scanning books on a single linear scanner was stupid, this is such a great idea.</p>
<p>This does look good, but the innovation is mainly in the use of off-the-shelf materials. This kind of automated book scanning machine is what is used in large scale scanning projects, it&#8217;s just that they normally cost about ten times what this one does.</p>
<p>Exactly , it&#8217;s like an Arm processor 3 years ago compared to an Intel one :D .</p>
<blockquote>presents the prototype design that he and other teammates created during the &#8220;20 percent time&#8221; that Google (and now Apple, among others) allocates for personal projects</blockquote>
<p>:D That&#8217;s right, bring Apple into every article. Go The Verge! :P</p>
<p>stop</p>
<p>Please go away.  I beg you.  You really seem like a terrible person.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason I put :P there. I was being sarcastic. I honestly think the article&#8217;s pretty interesting.</p>
<p>This is just brilliant.  And to think that this is his 20% project.  Thank you, Verge; now I feel like ASS.</p>
<p>I prefer the system employed in the book &#8220;Rainbow&#8217;s End&#8221;, where they shred the book into a thousand pieces, run it through a high-speed, multi-angle camera system, and piece the information back together &#8220;in post&#8221; by matching the chunks.</p>
<p>Problem is you have to destroy the book to do something like that. Remember that most of the books that Google had didn&#8217;t belong to them, so they needed an efficient system that didn&#8217;t damage the original. I love that now anyone can build their own systems without having to pay upward of a $100K; gotta love that.</p>
<p>It was sort of a point in the book.  Paper is obsolete and largely forgotten.  Everything is digital.</p>
<p>Yea, as gregorian says, the author was making a philosophical point by including that tech. By the year the book is set in, a large segment of the population has decided that paper books (and other analog media) are completely obsolete and no longer need to exist. It creates some interesting interplay, with people protesting the ongoing book destruction on a college campus, sometimes (ironically) via creating satirical digital overlays of the library. In Rainbow&#8217;s End, everyone has electronic contact lenses that give them very robust augmented reality, and in a future like that, there may indeed be no point in having physical books lying around.</p>
<p>This sucks.</p>
<p>could you do it? No. And it&#8217;s actually very useful- it&#8217;s not just a proof of concept.</p>
<p>But it still sucks. That&#8217;s how it works.</p>
<p>You make no sense. Troll on Engadget.</p>
<p>Woosh.</p>
<p>Leave the &#8220;suck&#8221; puns to those ridiculous YA-paranormal-vampire books pl0x.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t sweat it man, I got the joke and thought it quite funny.</p>
<p>icwatudidthar</p>
<p>Ahhh macbook Air.</p>
<p>It seems to me if the book is extremely valuable, you would not want to risk it on this machine (which has 45% of books getting a page ripped or folded). And if the book is not extremely valuable, just do as he said at the beginning &#8212; remove the binding and send it through a sheet-fed scanner (then send the pages to be rebound if necessary).</p>
<p>This is only a prototype though.  The page turning mechanism seems pretty novel and if it had a few more iterations of development perhaps that percentage could be reduced considerably.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also pretty sure a final version of this machine won&#8217;t actually be attached to a vacuum cleaner. It&#8217;s quite obviously a prototype, so you wouldn&#8217;t want to chuck your hundred year old manuscript in there without supervision.</p>
<p>Early models, while impressive, were very costly and did not treat the books with care.<br />

<p>Headline is as if it was a rumor that Google was to stop selling phones on Google play,</p>
<p>Anyway this is good news, Google play is the best place to buy phones, cheapest price and directly from Google, problems however rise when you need a replacement device, in that case Google charges you the full cost of the phone/tablet and don&rsquo;t refund you until they receive your broken unit, in my case that was never, <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TNT</span></span> either lost it or Google lost it since they have no track of my nexus 7, I&rsquo;m still waiting for my &pound;159.99 which google claim they refunded me yet i still haven&rsquo;t got the money in my bank!</p>
<p>And they <del>had</del> have my money since November!!</p>
<p>Swapping my defective Nexus 7 was a smooth process. I called Google, told &lsquo;em about my creaking screen, and they had a new tablet shipped out to me within a week. Having 250 bucks tied up for a week sucked, but I can&rsquo;t blame Google for holding that money as collateral until the other defective tablet returned.</p>
<p>I blame them and I&rsquo;ll continue to blame them, it&rsquo;s totally unacceptable.<br />
Other retailers manage to do it without having to take whatever the item is worth from your bank, <br />
Amazon for example, they ship you the replacement and you have a month to send your defective product back, if not you will be charged the full cost, and that&rsquo;s how it should be, if not there is even another solution, they ask you to ship it first and once they get it they ship you the replacement, that&rsquo;s how it should be done, there&rsquo;s no explanation as to why it&rsquo;s not done like this with Google.<br />
I&rsquo;m currently waiting for Google to give me my money back 4 months after they took it out, and it&rsquo;s gone to the point where they aren&rsquo;t even replying to my emails!.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience with Google checkout a couple of years ago and found loads of other people in the same situation. Google customer service is terrible in this regard put me off ever using Google checkout again. Google effectively refused to take responsibility for overcharging a transaction despite the fact I had the receipt for the correct amount and the seller wasn&rsquo;t responding.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s my having been in shipping before but I always record the tracking number for anything I send out.  I&rsquo;m actually waiting for my nexus 7 to be delivered to their warehouse (should actually be delivered today) so they release my $ but I did get my replacement nexus only a day and a half after speaking to Google&rsquo;s customer service team.</p>
<p>I think I must be one of the only people who has had a good experience with Google&rsquo;s customer service.  Ordered the original Nexus One- not an issue; the Galaxy Nexus- not an issue; the Nexus 7- had to be replaced because of a creaking screen but it has, so far, been painless.  The only issue I&rsquo;ve encountered has been wanting to order something, like the galaxy nexus dock and it not being in stock but it stated that pretty clearly.</p>
<p>How exactly are they to blame? It&rsquo;s not like a carrier, where they will charge that to your account if you don&rsquo;t return the defective device. So they&rsquo;re just watching their own back, your quarrel should be with the shipping company, not Google. I&rsquo;m sure you knew that though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other retailers manage to do it without having to take whatever the item is worth from your bank, Amazon for example, they ship you the replacement and you have a month to send your defective product back</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Online retail is Amazon&rsquo;s bread and butter. I expect this level of service from them. If Amazon was hosting an email service would you expect it to be on par with Gmail less than a year after launch? Nope.</p>
<p>Yes I would because if they are entering the space at the least the customer service portion should be good.  I&rsquo;d expect them to at least meet minimum standards for the service in general.  It shows they are serious about it.</p>
<p>Most do this. Apple, Amazon, others.  They won&rsquo;t charge you unless nothing comes back.  They may also cover shipping costs.  The only reason Google would not do this is lack of experience in dealing with human beings as customers in this manner.</p>
<p>You can probably report them to the <span class="caps">BBB</span> or equivalent.  If you used a CC report them to the CC vendor as well.</p>
<p>I will have no choice but to do that if i won&rsquo;t get my money back&hellip; however a Google employee seen my comment and is helping me in this matter =)</p>
<p>The $250 was authorization&#8230; The charge goes away after about a day or two. El Goog just wants to test your card/credit before they send it out should they need to bill you for not sending back the broken one.</p>
<p>Actually, they forget to remove it and it stays on for about 2-3 months.</p>
<p>That depends on your bank. Most remove the auth a couple to a few days without any charge. At the workplace we used to get some complaints about authorizations (hotels do this especially). None last longer than about a week. If it lasted months for you, they charged it erroneously.</p>
<p>Authorisations can&rsquo;t be held for long. They usually expire within 2 weeks.(For good banks and CC companies)</p>
<p>I had the same screen issue, got the replacement very nicely but they neglected to give me a <span class="caps">RMA</span> slip to return the old one. So a year later I&rsquo;ve still got the thing.. Must email them again.</p>
<p>My replacement&rsquo;s died now :( 2 Nexus 7 is less than a year isn&rsquo;t that good a record really, but I loved the device it was ideal for reading.</p>
<p>Question is whether I buy another one (3G one this time maybe) or I save the money and go on holiday. If I were to buy another one though I&rsquo;d probably buy it from an actual shop I can easily return it to when it breaks..</p>
<p>Or maybe just get the IPad Mini but that&rsquo;s ever more expensive than the 3G Nexus 7. I&rsquo;ll wait and see , hopefully they&rsquo;ll release a successor soon.</p>
<p>It seems to be fine only if you&rsquo;re based in the US.</p>
<p>I ordered the day the 7 was announced, and by the time it was available in local shops my order hadn&rsquo;t even shipped.  Since I was paying tax + shipping to get it from the Play store, I bought it locally and figured I could cancel my order.  Initially it went smoothly: I called and the sales rep said to refuse delivery and I&rsquo;d get credited back two weeks after they receive it.  The package took a week to make it back to Google where it was signed for at their dock, and I figured I&rsquo;d see my refund in two weeks.</p>
<p>Fast forward a month and I&rsquo;d called 5 times asking why the refund hadn&rsquo;t been applied, and every time I was told that someone hadn&rsquo;t done the <span class="caps">RMA</span> correctly.  The 6th time I called I threatened a chargeback if they couldn&rsquo;t resolve it, and (surprise) they said it got lost in their receiving department so I&rsquo;d be credited back immediately.</p>
<p>Contrast this to when I had a Nexus One:  I had two duds (dead pixels, dust under the screen) and each time Google overnight shipped a replacement in a posted return box with only a hold on my credit card for the replacement cost needed.  When I called in 6 months later saying that the lens on the battery cover cracked and I wanted to buy a replacement, they insisted on overnighting me one at their cost.</p>
<p>I know that level of service isn&rsquo;t practical with these no-contract lower cost and margin devices, but they need to step up their service if they want to be taken seriously as a sales channel.  I love Nexus hardware for the overall quality and stock Android, but I&rsquo;m hesitant to get another unless I feel I&rsquo;m getting more follow through than regular <span class="caps">ROM</span> updates.</p>
<p>They do not take any money from your account. They just put authorization on your card. If it is debit card, the money is subtracted from your account because that is how Debit cards work. But Google does not charge or claim that money. On credit card they just put authorization request to ensure that your card has capacity to pay in case you screw up and dont send the product back to them.<br />
They are giving you advance replacement and 21 days to send back your old device, it is only fair for them to protect themselves. <br />
The system is well established and that is how it works. It is more streamlined this way for both parties as you as customer has to wait less, and they are protected form scammers. <br />
All of them do it, google is actually more transparent about procedure. Likes of Newegg will simply charge your credit card one fine day. (Ok that were just couple of bad experiences in 50 odd transaction I had with them but it did happen ) And you wonder why the hell did that happen?<br />
The money does not go to google, it is held by the bank when you use debit card.<br />
And the transaction shows up in pending authorization or Outstanding Authorization Amount in your bank statement if you check your account.</p>
<p>I think its terrible news, Google Play is a disaster. They have outrageous shipping costs, slow as hell processing despite the huge shipping charges, and cant even come close to handling a big launch like the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>It would be <span class="caps">MUCH</span> better for all of us if they would just send the phones to retailers like Amazon and let us get competent service from people who know what theyre doing.</p>
<p>I have returned two Nexus 4&#8217;s and they only put a pending charge on my credit card both times until I returned the phone.  It&#8217;s a necessity in case you don&#8217;t return the phone.  Are they supposed to just trust that everyone really has a real problem and will actually return the phone?  You could lie and they send you a second phone that you would never pay for then.  They have to put a temporary authorization on your credit card.  It&#8217;s business 101.  You can&#8217;t get mad at them for that.</p>
<p>Point is, it&rsquo;s happened before and the Nexus 4 launch was extremely rough. It was worth a clarification.</p>
<p>I agree it was rough but it was never any doubt that Google would suddenly stop selling devices on Google Play, they just severely underestimated the demand and I&rsquo;m confident they&rsquo;ll improve next time they launch a device on Google Play.</p>
<p>There was some doubt and a clarification was needed.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard any of those doubts, in fact, the only thing I&rsquo;ve heard rumour-wise about Google hardware is that they&rsquo;re perhaps planning to open physical stores.</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;ve never been on the internet :).  The way they dropped selling devices once before and the bungling of the Nexus 4 has lead to fairly widespread concerns about this.</p>
<p>Ah, I see. We&rsquo;re taking about the tin foil forums now. Well, I personally take them as serious as the 9/11 conspiracy forums.</p>
<p>*tin foil hat forums&hellip;</p>
<p>Why was there doubt?  I never heard any rumors, and they&rsquo;re up to six devices in the Play store now.  They&rsquo;ve only been adding devices and improving the Play Store experience.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above &mdash; their past caginess and bungling contribute to a fairly widespread concern about whether they are serious about longterm online direct hardware sales.</p>
<p>Still is rough <span class="caps">IMO</span>. You literally have no shipping options to choose from which is rather annoying. Plus who knows when they will actually process your order. Both times I&rsquo;ve ordered devices from Play took about a week.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OMG</span>! AN <span class="caps">ENTIRE</span> <span class="caps">WEEK</span>? <span class="caps">WTFH</span>? <span class="caps">HOW</span> <span class="caps">DID</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">SURVIVE</span>!!!!?!?!??!</p>
<p>When the standard tends to be 24 hours for processing it is an issue.  This is not some mom and pop shop doing orders by hand.  This is a billion dollar multi-national corporation that already has checkout services and a large amount of online presence and expertise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s certainly good news that they&rsquo;d rather make it better than call it quits.</p>
<p>I was very rough when the Nexus One launched.</p>
<p>Clarification as to what? To suggest that the Play Store would just stop selling phones?</p>
<p>With all due respect Mr. Ziegler, that wasn&rsquo;t a clarification, it was just three short paragraphs of bullshit.</p>
<p>When will it be available to buy <em>anything</em> besides apps for The Netherlands?</p>
<p>Now that they have made up there mind, probably expansion plans are on their way.<br />
Fingers crossed here in india.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect them to sell for $350/$300 (nexus 4), $200 (nexus 7) in India even if they decided to sell.</p>
<p>Why not? So far they have sold it at a similar price in other countries, with the only real difference being taxes.</p>
<p>The reason would be no one India will pay for play store items(not apps) like movies, music etc..<br />
They are selling nexus at cost or even taking minor loss. They except to earn the money on play store services like Amazon.<br />
Which is not going to happen in India.</p>
<p>No they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well this is completely based on false assumptions.</p>
<p>No, they want you to use Google services. Gmail, Maps, YouTube, etc.</p>
<p>No they want you to look at ads. I mean come on.</p>
<p>Well, yes. Google is an advertising company. Generally those want you to look at their ads.</p>
<p>The EU is planning cross-EU copyright regulations, so that is probably going to help those in the EU outside the UK, France, etc get more content.</p>
<p>I &ndash; and many more people &ndash; feel your pain. Can only get apps here in South Africa as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be neat if they&rsquo;d expand hardware sales to, you know, the remaining 23 EU member states. Seriously. 4 countries? How about letting folks next door at least order from those 4 and ship it to wherever they happen to be in the union?</p>
<p>At least Google doesn&rsquo;t seem to be selling secretly different variants of the Nexus 4 like the company did with the Galaxy Nexus but it still looks to me like Google doesn&rsquo;t really want to sell hardware and definitely doesn&rsquo;t want its hardware to be successful.</p>
<p>Because them 4 EU states make up a large percentage of the entire EU. Each state has different regulations etc, Google has never sold a product with such high demand before. The fact they launched in 4 EU states, and the largest ones is an achievement for a company thats new to the market.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a simple thing.  They have to get regulatory approval to offer the device plus whatever legal aspects for being able to even sell in the country.  This can include copyright agreements since the devices can play media.  Apple for example took many years before they were able to sell the iPhone in as many countries as they are and they have retail presences all over the world already.</p>
<p>Just dont try to return something&hellip;. you may get a refund a month or two later&hellip; if you&rsquo;re lucky</p>
<p>It took them 3 months to remove the <span class="caps">RMA</span> hold they put on my card. They seem to have no idea how todo it.</p>
<p>same here. I got a replacement. one month passed already. i am still waiting for my money.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all well &amp; good, but Google really need to up their distribution game in addition to making the Play Store more robust to traffic spikes so it performs as people expect even at those peak times.</p>
<p>Getting their products in more outlets (from big format retailers like Best Buy/Tesco to smaller shops) like Samsung &amp; Apple do so well is the real key to shifting volume.</p>
<p>Selling them primarily on Play alone will not get them out of the niche &amp; to a wider audience that their devices deserve.</p>
<p>There next goal should be to expand. Too few countries are getting the joy of nexus 4 at its recommend retail price.</p>
<p>definitely, this is a must<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>Nexus 4 has been back in stock in UK Play store the last few weeks, which is encouraging.</p>
<p>Was still a major screwup on launch though.<br />
1) Laughable job underestimating demand at that price point.<br />
2) After the experience they had selling Nexus One (both probs selling the phone and organising support) should have been much more on the ball managing launch and responding to ppl re: delays.</p>
<p>Bottom line &ndash; they have now missed the window to sell lots of Nexus 4s (if of course that was ever the plan &ndash; which it may not have been given the smack that would have meant to LG&rsquo;s handset GMs). The 2013 <span class="caps">MWC</span> devices are now showcasing which means Nexus 4 being blotted out of the 24/7 news cycle.</p>
<p>Trust me, there will be another sales spike after Google I|O 2013. None of the devices showcased at <span class="caps">MWC</span> will have Key Lime Pie within weeks of the announcement like the Nexus 4.</p>
<p>That said, the question remains as to how many N4&rsquo;s could been have sold back in November/December 2012 if Google had enough to satisfy demand? Google <em>must</em> get its hardware launches straightened out.</p>
<p>Great concept, poor execution. Now, if only the market followed Google in offering flagships for a realistic price. Maybe not $350, but $750 has to go.</p>
<p>Fine. Now make it available to the rest of the world</p>
<p>I just wish they could have picked up the pace in opening it&rsquo;s Google Play services to more countries.</p>
<p>Well Google you had better get your act together. The Nexus 4 fiasco was totally unacceptable.</p>
<p>Please let the retail stores happen soon. When I was passing through the US, if they had a retail store, with a $299 Nexus 4 available, it would be a no brainer instant purchase for me.</p>
<p>It is avail in retail store of t-mobile:okok<img src="fine" alt="" />t-mobile doesn&rsquo;t want to screw its blackberry lunch next month so they put the nexus 4 at 550$(ya t-mobile is scared of the nexus4(as all other cell service provider are.google only need to up to 400$ its play card to grab the market and cell service provider knows it.</p>
<p>I am not sure that t-mobile is scared of the nexus 4 and what it represents, from its 30 dollar plan to its family value plans (an even better value than the 30 dollar plan), I think that it is accepting the fact that it is going to be a dumb pipe.</p>
<p>Enough of Google already</p>
<p>i laughed when i read this. Considering the problems aren&rsquo;t since the n7, the gnex was a nightmare too.</p>
<p>The GNex was not sold through the Play Store and was sold via operators and retailers, originally.</p>
<p>the originally is kinda the key part. I got mine through play store, and it was awful way back then. the N4 was awful too, where is the bright side?!</p>
<p>I got my Gnex through the play store as well, and I had no problem at all.  It&rsquo;s hit or miss, I guess.</p>
<p>That is the problem isn&rsquo;t it then?  No consistent experience?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree.  Google knows they have to fix it or they&rsquo;ll fail, obviously.  Personally, I look forward to buying my next phone from them.</p>
<p>I am somewhat skeptical because in my dealings with them over the last few years from a CS perspective I&rsquo;ve not seen much improvement.  This may change as they move forward to dealing more with direct sales.</p>
<p>Google play has 2 problem.1:there is no google play gift card at WalMart or other big store to buy say a smartphone.2:even if google play was to release some they still couldn&rsquo;t sell the freaking cellphone device.!why?almost always back order as it is on google play.imagine if they were to release say a 400 $ google play card instead of a 50 $(actual one avail at wal.mart)instead of a 2 week delay it would be a 6 month delay.but then those problem I am pretty sure google is happy to have and when google supplier are ready.xont doubt for a second big chain store all over the pls et will get those 400$ google play card so people can buy without using personal card</p>
<p>You should really consider reading what you type before you click &ldquo;Post&rdquo;.  That said, if you want $300 or $400 cards, just buy 6 or 8 of them.  Sure it&rsquo;s not ideal, but it gets the job done.</p>
<p>The problem with that, is that Play store gift cards/credit cannot be used towards the purchase of hardware.</p>
<p>Buy a reloadable <span class="caps">VISA</span> card and use that instead.</p>
<p>Ahh, did not know that.</p>
<p>google play gift cards have been @ target since november, 2012</p>
<p>I bought one at 7-11 the other day.</p>
<p>They could just buy Best Buy for their existing network of retail locations and established online retailing and distribution presence&hellip;</p>
<p>The cost of removing the sleaze from those sites would be huge.</p>
<p>They have a handful of products.  How would they fill those stores?</p>
<p>Recommend for Coach McGuirk.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I haven&rsquo;t upvoted him before just for McGuirk.  Here, have another.</p>
<p>Hope they also sell the xphone on the play store.</p>
<p>Me too!</p>
<p>Does it send your personal details to LG like when you buy apps from developers?</p>
<p>Only when you claim on the warranty after 14 days.</p>
<p>Such a sick burn.  (Not really)</p>
<p>Do you post in every google article now?</p>
<p>They need to sell the devices in the Play Store app on Android too.  It is confusing that I can buy more things in certain places.</p>
<p>Buy Nexus&hellip; on Nexus!</p>
<p>Inception!</p>
<p>The Nexus line is a great value. I do think Google needs to upgrade it&rsquo;s eCommerce site and systems. My favorite is the order numbers that you&rsquo;re expected to repeat over the phone. 15731260465432498277.1542244649533864 is an example. My guess is they won&rsquo;t have to worry about that number being duplicated for at least three weeks&hellip;</p>
<p>If you use the &ldquo;Call Me Back&rdquo; feature, you don&rsquo;t have to hand over any details.</p>
<p>How about keeping them in stock.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NOW</span> make it worldwide, what its the point of having a good affordable phone that most countries cant get</p>
<p>My experience with Google Play store was extremely pleasant . Google(and Apple and  Amazon) doesnt sell its devices online  in India (my native place )a nd so, I tend to purchase plenty of stuff for Indian friends from American online retail stores .In this instance, I ordered a Nexus 7 from play store for a friend back home . The shipment time wasnt displayed until the payment was processed . It turned out to be 8-9 days and I was supposed to leave <span class="caps">USA</span> for South Asia  in  5 days . I emailed the google customer care about my predicament .WHile they didsnt guarantee anything, I found out that the shipment has been changed to express delivery ; the tablet reached me in 2 days . I had a similarly amazing experience with Apple Online Store . American customer care rocks !</p>
<p>Their customer service is a nightmare.</p>
<p>I placed an order for two chargers and then realized, within 15 minutes, that my business partner had already ordered them. I emailed them to cancel the order.</p>
<p>I was told via email that &ldquo;it was too late&rdquo; and that the order had already been processed. I would have to refuse delivery in order to not be charged. Fine.</p>
<p>Well, after waiting 2.5 weeks I never received shipping confirmation. I emailed them 6 times over the course of a week and kept getting the response that &ldquo;a shipping specialist was looking into it.&rdquo; Well, after a week of this they confirmed that my order had indeed been cancelled.</p>
<p>What a freakin&rsquo; nightmare.</p>
<p>So when can I buy a Nexus 4 bumper?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone actually thought it was going away, but I am glad they are keeping it.</p>
<p>I do hope however they <span class="caps">IMPROVE</span> it and not sit on their laurels. If Google really, really wants to prove that buying phones, etc online works they need to do a better job with the following:</p>
<p>1) Stock/Ordering &ndash; this one is really easy &ndash; pretty much every other company does a decent job at this, but Google needs to let people pre-order, better estimate needs, and stock items properly. I think they can learn from their new Motorola counterpoints. Getting a Nexus4 was a pain.</p>
<p>2) Customer Service &ndash; This is one area Google can improve and innovate in. Selling devices contract free takes carriers out of the equation and making it work means giving users another reliable source of service they can deal with. Its pretty terrible right now. A minor investment and some tips from Zappos and I am happy :).</p>
<p>Lets see what happens. Right now, Google Play Devices fall well behind the industry &ndash; if you can learn from data in everything else, learn from your customer feedback and don&rsquo;t be afraid to invest in customer service &ndash; ask zappos how that worked out.</p>
<p>To all the people lucky enough to live in one of the 7 countries, at least you have the option to buy from them or not.<br />
I live in New Zealand a 2hr flight from Australia, and we don&rsquo;t get any Hardware, music etc. I would definitely buy from the Google store if I could .<br />
Like any other retail encounter, if its a good experience for you,  you will go back to the retailer and trade with them again, if its bad you wont</p>
<p>IIRC this happened to The Verge once before. Hopefully it&#8217;s just a case of Google being overly sensitive to potential threats and not an actual problem.</p>
<p>When Google knocks out Twitter access it&#8217;s an actual problem.</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s a problem, but I was referring to the potential issue of Twitpic offering up malware to its millions of users.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re only blocking twitter pages that have Twitpics in them. Not all pages do so it doesn&#8217;t completely block twitter</p>
<p>Most pages have retweeted someone with a Twitpic link, which is enough for Chrome or Google search result to block your profile. Search Twitter for &#8220;Twitpic&#8221;. It&#8217;s affecting a lot of people.</p>
<p>About 90% of the photos on twitpic are malicious anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>Whatever happened to &quot;Don&quot;t be evil&quot; Google?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called an &#8220;algorithm&#8221;.  If TwitPic got caught in a false-positive, I&#8217;m sure it will be corrected quickly.</p>
<p>According to the safe browsing page, it&#8217;s not a false-positive.</p>
<p>Could be a rare false positive, could be Twitpic actually is hosting something malicous&#8230;</p>
<p>Either way what&#8217;s that got to do with being evil?</p>
<p>Other than it being something MSFT enthusiasts/fanboys like to drag up in every Google article on The Verge.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t be caught blocking rival services deliberately. They&#8217;d get screwed by the EU amongst others.</p>
<p>What an original comment</p>
<p>TwitPic&#8217;s ads are dodgy, so this doesn&#8217;t surprise me.</p>
<p>How in the world is this evil?</p>
<p>Typical msft fan.</p>
<p>Good! Killing twitpic is the way to go&#8230;<br />
They practically killed themselves by resizing all uploads</p>
<p>I forget, is twitpic still the default twitter photo host?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s Photobucket.</p>
<p>It was at the beginning. Now Twitter is hosting the photos themselves</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the 12029 pages we tested on the site over the past 90 days, 0 page(s) resulted in malicious software being downloaded and installed without user consent. The last time Google visited this site was on 2012-12-30, and suspicious content was never found on this site within the past 90 days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Has this site hosted malware?</strong> No, this site has not hosted malicious software over the past 90 days.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitpic.com%2F&client=googlechrome&hl=en-GB" target="_blank">http://safebrowsing.clients.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitpic.com%2F&amp;client=googlechrome&amp;hl=en-GB</a></p>
<p>That just makes it even more strange that they would have it blocked, considering there owuld be no false positives. o.O</p>
<p>That can happen when a site has known-malware providing URLs in the code but the malware hosting site is down (for example).  So the site gets flagged for trying to provide malware but has zero incidents of malicious software being downloaded and installed.  I&#8217;ve seen this one first hand.</p>
<p>Ads carried on Twitpic were spreading malware apparently. Twitpic contacted Google to let them know they&#8217;d resolved it.</p>
<p>This is why Twitpic itself was showing as clean, as the ads were hosted on other domains.</p>
<p>now the aforementioned page lists:<br />
<blockquote>Of the 12674 pages we tested on the site over the past 90 days, 31 page(s) resulted in malicious software being downloaded and installed without user consent. The last time Google visited this site was on 2012-12-31, and the last time suspicious content was found on this site was on 2012-12-30.<br />
Malicious software includes 13 trojan(s), 4 exploit(s). Successful infection resulted in an average of 8 new process(es) on the target machine.<br />
Malicious software is hosted on 5 domain(s), including mpchester.info/, malatyuhr.com/, iloveeu.info/.<br />
2 domain(s) appear to be functioning as intermediaries for distributing malware to visitors of this site, including 2upmedia.com/, adexcite.com/.</blockquote></p>
<p>Curiously, my boss at work just tried to send an email with a tinyurl in it, and it got rejected. Maybe a sign that something is off right now with their malware thresholds?</p>
<p>Also flagging any other webpages that have a Twitpic widget.</p>
<p>I thought this was weird, too.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t an uncommon thing, either for a site to be hacked to serve up malware, or for a site&#8217;s ad network to accidentally serve up some malware.  Looking at the main page&#8217;s code I don&#8217;t see anything bad, but I also see some commented out advertising code (a script and an iframe), so it&#8217;s possible that was the culprit.</p>
<p>Twitpic doesn&#8217;t have to &#8220;contact Google to remove the warning&#8221;, they just have to ensure there&#8217;s no malware anywhere on their site and then log into the Google Webmaster tools they setup for their site and request a review, then Google will automatically review the site and if the malware is gone remove the warning.</p>
<p>Easy.</p>
<p>It will take 1 or 2 days before those changes kick in &#8211; or for them to find they have to try again.</p>
<p>Call it a wild guess,  but I think the Twitpic guys want it solved a bit sooner, so they have to reach Google. If only we all had similar access to the web police.</p>
<p>Good point, just didn&#8217;t like the &#8220;victim&#8221; tone of the tweet when it&#8217;s just a big automated process that does all this stuff.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, but try to understand that Google has  shut them out of the &#8220;open&#8221; web for now and left them to regain their users trust &#8211; all without even saying why.</p>
<p>Users &#8211; most of whom don&#8217;t follow tech sites &#8211; facing a page saying the twitpic is dangerous to their computer and is serving malware is a huge blow to the site&#8217;s credibility.</p>
<p>IMO they&#8217;re playing it cool. I&#8217;d be raising hell  now.</p>
<p>Well there is a detailed page as to why, though as you say the details will be lost on most people.</p>
<p>I would wager though that there actually is a good reason for that to come up, given the commented out ad code it&#8217;d bet more on there being something funny with the ads being served than it just being a random false positive on Google&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>They could be playing it cool because they don&#8217;t know exactly what happened and if they raised hell now and found out later that it was malware code in their site they&#8217;d lose even more face..  one of those things you&#8217;ve got to be sure of before going on the offensive :D</p>
<p>Forgot to add it&#8217;s a 2 edged sword too, if there was malware on my site I&#8217;d rather have Google warning people rather than risk infecting people.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;<br />

<p>The main page says 0 pages out of 12029, but these clearly do not.</p>
<p>I am sure someone posted a malware link via twitpic and the google algorithm blocked what it thought would keep people safe but cast a too wide net.  google does this all the time.  it&#8217;s all automated.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like how there isn&#8217;t a &#8216;visit anyway option&#8217; (at least there isn&#8217;t on the Chrome iOS app)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s under &#8220;advanced&#8221; in the browser version, not sure if it&#8217;s there on the iOS app as well.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t from what I&#8217;ve tried&#8230; So frustrating as it does it to Washington Post articles quite often.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons I stopped using Chrome. They went from being a helpful nice little browser to an overlord that intentionally obscures basic things.</p>
<p>What in the hell is &#8220;Advanced&#8221; about &#8220;I want to visit anyways&#8221;? That&#8217;s a UI fail and a half and I understand there MAY be a concern for people to mindless click-through it, but honestly I have NEVER encountered that suspicious page alert except in false positives. And I&#8217;ll just say that my browsing habits aren&#8217;t the most innocent, so I can&#8217;t imagine what you&#8217;d have to do in order to trigger a real alert.</p>
<p>I remember when it was easy to disable things in Chrome, namely in the sake of privacy or &#8220;just don&#8217;t remember this kind of crap,&#8221; now it&#8217;s a chore. Safari 6 sealed the deal for me (I hated not having the omnibar), I don&#8217;t need to feed the Google machine more than I already do.</p>
<p>No it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Twitpic&#8217;s ad network was serving up malware, putting &#8220;I want to visit anyway&#8221; under advanced means unsuspecting people won&#8217;t be hit by drive-by malware or whatever &amp; people who are aware of such things can hit advanced then visit anyway.</p>
<p>Perfectly sensible move</p>
<p>Probably  a bug or something on the google side.  If they don&#8217;t have it fixed quickly then it would be time to start pulling out the tinfoil hats imho.</p>
<p>Twitpic&#8217;s ads were serving malware.</p>
<p>They sorted it &amp; Google unblocked them</p>
<p>It blocked thebay.com earlier this week. It&#8217;s the oldest Canadian retail brand just FYI.</p>
<p>So?</p>
<p>Any site can be hacked, the big ones usually are</p>
<p>Sure, except this one wasn&#8217;t .</p>
<p>Happens to big sites all the time. Not a mistake, companies won&#8217;t admit it but they are being hacked all the time. This is just another example.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s one of their advertising partners. This happens all the time, just not always to a high profile site. When the TwitPic page loads it&#8217;s OK for a moment or two, then wigs out and goes to the red-screen-of-don&#8217;t-do-that. Considering the AutoPlay ads with sound on TwitPic I don&#8217;t blame them.</p>
<p>yeah, malicious code/links in the ad embeds are most likely.</p>
<p>This is happening now on all of Twitter!</p>
<p>Possibly fixed now? How does this work for people: <a href="http://twitpic.com/bqx0qw" target="_blank">http://twitpic.com/bqx0qw</a></p>
<p>Yup I&#8217;m not getting the warning anymore.</p>
<p>Why would you pick an iPhone as the photo opp for this story?  Doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>Just me?</p>
<p>Ha</p>
