<p>No surprise here. I heard so mention that upwards of 70% of the apps Blackberry is releasing with are Android ports.</p>
<p>I read that it was more like 69,000 of the 70,000 were non-native apps. (eg, Android ports or HTML5)</p>
<p>Maybe that was it. I just remember it being seventy something and non-native.</p>
<p>You are thinking of what was mentioned in the review by The Verge:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;BlackBerry says that it&rsquo;s launching the Z10 and BlackBerry 10 with about 70,000 apps. I know what you&rsquo;re thinking: that&rsquo;s a lot of apps to come with out of the gate. Unfortunately, while testing the device I felt like it was really something like <strong>69,000 really mediocre</strong> (or just plain bad) applications.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>As far as I am aware, that isn&rsquo;t anything like a hard number and even if it were, it doesn&rsquo;t correlate at all with the percentage of ported or HTML5 applications.</p>
<p>40% are Android apps. coming from Martyn Mallick, VP at blackberry on the day BB10 was launched.</p>
<p>It was also known that skype would be an android port since then.</p>

<p>There is some delicious irony in the BB apps being bad ports of Android apps, some of which are horrible ports of iOS apps.</p>
<p>Does this somehow make them decent?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be surprised if a well-done android app like any.do or Falcon could be easily ported.</p>
<p>That depends on whether two wrongs make a right.<br />
Really, as an Android user I&rsquo;m tired of shitty apps. Can&rsquo;t imagine what BB10 will feel like in that respect.</p>
<p>Engadget review:</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://imageshack.us/a/img266/9729/bb10flashingquality.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Well you see the problem right? You were on Engadget.</p>
<p>True, but you can&rsquo;t deny that the &ldquo;port-a-thon&rdquo; did some serious damage. I doubt a large chuck of those quickly ported apps will ever get updated. It makes Blackberry&rsquo;s app store look really poor quality.</p>
<p>On this very site I&rsquo;ve seen posters who proudly admitted to making bad apps for the sake of making bad apps, so as to claim a Playbook and such. Some people have no respect or decency whatsoever. In any case the point is moot as it doesn&rsquo;t take thousands of apps to satisfy the end user.</p>
<p>I just threw up in my mouth a little. I take it that&hellip; Thing is an Android app? Cause what I&rsquo;ve seen of native BB10 apps are quite nice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if the first one is an android app, but those other two broken apps are just Playbook apps thrown together to work on BB10. That&rsquo;s why they look messed up in portrait mode.</p>
<p>There are quality apps, you just have to dig for them.</p>
<p>I would rather trust Josh from the Verge than rim lying to the press to save its own asses!</p>
<p>Thank you for the hard numbers!</p>
<p><span class="caps">FAIL</span></p>
<p>Epic, epic <span class="caps">FAIL</span>.</p>
<p>So much BB10 hype, so much potential with <span class="caps">QNX</span> and a new ui&hellip;and&hellip;we get this?</p>
<p>Wow. I seriously thought for a moment BB10 had a shot at number 3. WP8 looks like it&rsquo;ll take that spot.</p>
<p>Android app have more features than the qwp8 version. <br />
 And wp is 6 it will never be 3rd bada out sells it</p>
<p>Windows Phone had the entire might of Microsoft behind it for <span class="caps">TWO</span> years of being shot against <span class="caps">RIM</span> (now Blackberry) selling what, not even warm Blackberry 7 shit?  And <span class="caps">STILL</span> Microsoft couldn&rsquo;t even steal marketshare from Blackberry, they <span class="caps">STILL</span> can&rsquo;t even get three percent marketshare.</p>
<p>What does it say about you when your &ldquo;wrecking crew&rdquo; shows up with a half tonne Lumia 920 and you <span class="caps">STILL</span> can&rsquo;t knock down the half collapsed <span class="caps">RIM</span> wall?</p>
<p>The way I see it, Microsoft will have to fight like freaking hell to best Blackberry.  Blackberry 7 was too hard for them to beat, now the giant is trying to fight back, it&rsquo;s only gotten worse for WP</p>
<p>jaywontdart:<br />
I wish BB all the best as I&rsquo;m Canadian&hellip;<br />
However, let&rsquo;s get back to reality here&hellip;BB are now number 4 in the US behind WP8 which was just released in November.  In Europe outside of the UK, WP8 is taking in some counrtries over 15%&hellip;even in Brazil WP has about 20%</p>
<p>BB10 is a great first effort but it&rsquo;s extremely buggy, the UI has a long way to go and there are basically a handful of native good apps right now&hellip;</p>
<p>BB desparately need to release a low cost BB10 device for the emerging markets to keep the marketshare that they have there&hellip;.Nokia are releasing full on WP8 devices for around $200USD unlocked&hellip;good luck to BB, they will need it and need a boat full of cash</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a radicalized Microsoft hater, don&rsquo;t bother illuminating him with facts.</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s market shhare is actually down from the 4th quarter even with the release of wp8. Com scores latest numbers reveal this.</p>
<p>That share number includes Windows Mobile and thus isn&rsquo;t a useful look at Phone 8 share.</p>
<p>Wait, so you mean that there&rsquo;s only a &ldquo;Microsoft marketshare&rdquo; entry&hellip;&hellip;..but if those Windows Mobile users are finally deserting that platform and <span class="caps">NOT</span> buying another Microsoft phone&hellip;&hellip;..then it&rsquo;s still truthful that the combined Microsoft marketshare is decreasing, right?</p>
<p>In a very technically focused way, yes. But it isn&rsquo;t a useful measurement.</p>
<p>It is like combining Apple II userbase, Newton userbase, Mac Classic userbase, PowerPC Mac userbase, and Intel Mac userbase into a single &ldquo;Apple&rdquo; category,</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t matter if there were windows mobile users included because the fact still remains that in 2 years and 2 major pushes by Microsoft it has ultimately lead to zero intake of any kind of market share. Its 2 years going on 3 and still the needle is moving backwards. At some point you would have to think that it will be gaining ground but as the numbers come out every quarter its always losing a percentage and when Microsoft fans see that what do they do? They blame Microsoft mobile. When is it just going to be that windows phone 7/8 is not successful. They just had a major launch and still nothing not even stay the same. That&#8217;s telling to me that people still don&#8217;t view windows phone as a platform at all even with all these ad campaigns. What&#8217;s going to Benevento more telling is this next quarter when again it will drop that will pretty much tell the story of windows phone. Give windows 8 one more quarter to see if it can catch on but I&#8217;m not betting on it. Androids market share was exponentially increasing quarter after quarter and that was without any competition and with these numbers and the abundance of competition I feel like windows lost its chance. Is Microsoft going to continue throwing money at a project that isn&#8217;t successful which will be going on year 3? I just don&#8217;t see where they will fit in if Jo one is willing to adopt them.</p>
<p>No, it absolutely does not compare to that.</p>
<p>Theres a big Microsoft chunk of the pie chart.  Just as there is for Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Windows Mobile 6.  Know what came after that?  Windows Mobile 6.5.  Know what came after that?</p>
<p>Windows Phone 7.  And after that?  Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>You make it sound like the Apple and Google phone marketshare chart is including every 15GB iPod ever sold and every Gmail account, compared to just the Windows Phone 7 Focus S models sales!</p>
<p>Really, I dont understand why you are fighting so hard over this.</p>
<p>Microsoft defenders=Republicans.  You both live in your own bubble, far removed from the rest of the world.  And yet you claim every bit of news is from &ldquo;The &lt;Google/Apple&gt; Media!&rdquo; who are paid to lie about poor innovative and misunderstood Microsoft.</p>
<p>Writing off valid points as being from some &ldquo;anti freedom communist who wants to destroy A-Microsoft-ican family values!&rdquo; does not change the real world.</p>
<p>And those living in bubbles shouldn&rsquo;t throw sharp words around! :-)</p>
<p>There are always some wacky countries out there, I hear some of them still don&rsquo;t have the metric system and execute citizens through killer flying robots, electrified furniture and injected poisons!</p>
<p>In regards to phone marketshare, I&rsquo;m talking about the <span class="caps">USA</span>, UK, Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The Zed 10 isn&rsquo;t even really out, most people here couldn&rsquo;t buy one even if we wanted to right now.  It hasn&rsquo;t even had a week of full sales! :-)</p>
<p>Samsung, the worlds largest phone maker (and <span class="caps">OLED</span> panel maker, probably <span class="caps">LCD</span> maker, perhaps flash memory maker, Television, Blu ray and <span class="caps">DVD</span> players&hellip;&hellip;.soon refrigerators, washing machines&hellip;&hellip;) have full <span class="caps">ANDROID</span> phones for less than 200 dollars, and have been selling them for years now.</p>
<p>Why would starving people throw out their Android devices to rebuy a Nokia now?</p>
<p>Because the sub-$200 Samsung phones are garbage?<br />
Honestly &ndash; compare a Galaxy Ace 2 to a Lumia 620. The Noika is leagues ahead.</p>
<p>At what?  This Noika thing, how is it in any way ahead?  Where are the apps?  Actually, why is Nokia making so many low end phones?  6 this and 7 that, and isn&rsquo;t there a new 820 and even an &ldquo;822&rdquo; just for one particular US network?</p>
<p>Focus on the high end, have a great middle end phone, and a token cheap as hell phone for nations where the power is on for an hour a day.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply not better than the Android offerings and having so many devices when you are in Nokias selling-off-the-family-home status&hellip;&hellip;it&rsquo;s just another of their bad decisions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the Galaxy Ace before, the iPhone ripoff, and its better than the 710 or whatever the black Nokia I saw instore.</p>
<p>New Zealand was an <span class="caps">ALL</span> Nokia nation at one time, and now we have a token 920 in <span class="caps">BLACK</span> which sits on the wall of stores, going nowhere.  It&rsquo;s not even functional!  It&rsquo;s just a plastic block with a sticker showing how the screen should look.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked my local Vodafone store how their Windows Phone 7 sales were, and they couldn&rsquo;t even sell <span class="caps">ONE</span> Lumia 800 at that particular store.  Telecom has the 920 mockup, but they couldn&rsquo;t really tell me how it&rsquo;s been for them.  They didn&rsquo;t know anything about it, I doubt they sell them very often if at all.</p>
<p>Again, if they can&rsquo;t sell high end Nokias here, why would the teeming masses somehow pony up the cash to rebuy a new Nokia when they already have a cheaper, more reliable Android device?</p>
<p>Windows Phone is also doing badly here in Canada but in the countries that actually count, it&rsquo;s gaining significant marketshare&hellip;still miles and miles behind iOS and even further behind Android but it on an upward trend.</p>
<p>The US stats are anyone&rsquo;s guess&hellip;a few weeks ago another company released data that showed WP was growing in the US and overtook BB which I do find believable&hellip;<br />
I also can believe that they are still losing percentage wise against Apple as the big US carriers are selling iphones at a 10-1 rate compared to other phones&hellip;</p>
<p>I did. Only regret I didn&rsquo;t do it sooner. Why? UI, Nokia Drive, Camera, Integrated contacts and social networks &hellip; sold my rooted S3 after countless attempts at trying to find third party dialler apps, keyboards, browsers and music players. Darn thing ended up looking like something Dr Frankenstein created.</p>
<p>You are claimed you messed up every part of your Galaxy S III&rsquo;s  interface that you possibly could, and then you blame the phone for your design sensibilities being somewhat &ldquo;Dr Frankenstein&rdquo;? ;-)</p>
<p>You could have restored your phone at any time, or simply flashed actual Android to it, stock Jellybean as The Lord Google intended :-)</p>
<p>The comment thread is about comparing to a Nokia Lumia 620, you swapped your  &ldquo;Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair&rdquo; Galaxy S <span class="caps">III</span> for the lowest end Windows Phone around????</p>
<p>Oh wow, guy2000 is on the place, our &ldquo;I-don&rsquo;t-think-anything-good-about-<span class="caps">RIM</span>-they-have-hardly-any-chance-and-I-will-post-this-5-times-under-every-BlackBerry-related-article-and-I-will-separate-every-sentence-with-three-fkn-dots-instead-of-one&rdquo;-guy. I really missed you and as I read</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish BB all the best as I&rsquo;m Canadian&hellip;<br />
However, let&rsquo;s get back to reality here&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew it was you. Especially great this time I found</p>
<p>&ldquo;BB10 is a great first effort but it&rsquo;s <strong>extremely buggy</strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh wooooow. Stick with your whatever that is. It&rsquo;s crap.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LOL</span></p>
<p>Some of you MS people are starting to be quite annoying.</p>
<p>Where do does the extremely buggy come from. I thought there was a consensus that WP8 was less stable than 7.5? And I used 7.5 and had to reboot often enough, mainly settings &amp; camera crashes{???]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say they are both buggy.</p>
<p>Someone -had a breakdown here. Please help yourself.</p>
<p>Nothing against your arguments but the same arguments could have been better received if it had been little coherent.</p>
<p>Wait..are blaming Blackberry for this? They are not the ones making Skype. Microsoft is. So where is the <span class="caps">OUTRAGE</span> at Microsoft for not delivering a native app for BB10, like it happened with Google&rsquo;s apps for WP?</p>
<p>Huh? No outrage then? Didn&rsquo;t think so. Might want to think about that before you Microsoft fans jump on Google for not providing you with native apps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Might want to think about that before you Microsoft fans jump on Google for not providing you with native apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what non-native apps does google provide?</p>
<p>The same number as the amount of other OSes WP supports through emulation: zero</p>
<p>-<img title="Straw man" src="http://www.fotoblography.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/straw-man-740x550.jpg" alt="Straw man" /></p>
<p>minsk&hellip;Do you, or anyone for that matter, expect Microsoft to lend resources to creating a native Skype app for BB10?  Microsoft&rsquo;s goal is to perfect Skype for WP, which is what they are focusing on at the moment.  Even I would be a tad upset if Microsoft put forth and prioritized their efforts for creating a native Skype app <span class="caps">BEFORE</span> they got their own house (WP) in order.</p>
<p>Further, Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t owe BB anything&hellip;that they are even allowing a port, BB users should be thankful.</p>
<p>And Google doesn&rsquo;t have any native apps on WP, and have been very vocal about <span class="caps">NOT</span> creating any.</p>
<p>So its not OK for Google to do it but it is OK for Microsoft? For Microsoft its why would they put resources towards it? For Google its , they are the bad guy! Can&#8217;t have both way Microsoft fans</p>
<p>Microsoft just released Skype updates for iOS and Android&hellip;none for Windows Phone&hellip;you&rsquo;ll actually find MS releasing more updates for the other platforms than their own of late&hellip;it would be hard to argue that MS is intentionally trying to screw with BB&hellip;they probably just don&rsquo;t have the resources to devote to BB since the BB10 platform will take sometime before it gets off the ground</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how this is the same situation as Google and Microsoft.  For one, Microsoft is actually porting an app to BB10, sure it is an Android port and not a native app but that alone is more than Google has done for WP8.  Blackberry is partly to blame for this because they allow Android apps to be ported.  If they only wanted native apps then they shouldn&rsquo;t allow for Android apps to be ported.  Also, it is possible (though I wouldn&rsquo;t get my hopes up) that this could simply be a temporary port while they build a true native app for BB10.</p>
<p>As for Google and WP8, Google has yet to release an app for the platform and thus far have stated they have no immediate plans to develop any apps for WP8.  They have actually done more to reduce support for WP8 by dropping support for <span class="caps"><span class="caps">EAS</span></span> than they have to support the platform.</p>
<p>Completely different situations in my opinion.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t see how bits the same situation because it won&#8217;t effect you.</p>
<p>I think there will be a cross platform alternative for Skype very soon, like WhatsApp. I honestly hate this big apps which depentently belong to Apple, Google and MS (ok, Apple has none itself) like Skype or Google Now. They&rsquo;re using this gorgeous tools like chessmen and it&rsquo;s driving me nuts. Whatever, I won&rsquo;t go for any Windows or Android phone just because of those apps, as for me they can choke on their damn apps, I&rsquo;ll go with the better native phone and I know I&rsquo;ll miss <strong>nothing</strong> at the end.</p>
<p>Last I checked Skype IS cross platform. Android, iOS, WP, Windows, Mac and Linux. It&rsquo;s even available for the PS Vita.  Bb10 came out a week ago for crying out load&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10251/is-skype-available-for-blackberry-devices?frompage=search&q=blackberry&fromSearchFirstPage=false" target="_blank">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10251/is-skype-available-for-blackberry-devices?frompage=search&amp;q=blackberry&amp;fromSearchFirstPage=false</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any other video calling service with that level of cross platform compatibility.</p>
<p>In the rest of the world there is no doubt WP8 will be number 3&hellip;<br />
In Canada WP8 is probably number 5&hellip;MS Canada marketing should be fired up here&hellip;pathetic</p>
<p>Upwards of that. BB10 only has ~1000 native apps.</p>
<p>Let that number sink in&hellip; 1000.</p>
<p>Source?</p>
<p>It really is sad. Having seen these Android ports I have to say its fairly sad that BlackBerry touts them. Its a sad disconnected experience and I have no idea why they chose to ruin their core experience with these mediocre Android 2.3 apps. Accepting mediocrity and imperfection only undervalues your core product(which is not that bad).</p>
<p>Exactly. BB10 is a great platform, it&rsquo;s going to get a bad rap all around for having &lsquo;shitty apps&rsquo; when it&rsquo;s all due to a damn Android emulator. It would be better to launch with fewer apps, and have those apps be a great native experience. They&rsquo;ve sold the soul of the platform with this stupid emulation.</p>
<p>Such elitists statements undermine technology and competition. Obviously you have a lot to learn, including the fact that 7/10 means &ldquo;Very good. A solid product with some flaws.&rdquo; as per <a href="http://www.theverge.com/how-we-rate">this</a> &ndash; unless you were referring to your own opinion and not the review of the product in which case you should make it clear. Thanks.</p>
<p>I almost agree. I wish they encouraged porting, but provided the app met some of BB design guidelines. So in someway weed out the really bad experiences like apple, but not be so rigid. ie. middle ground between the play store and app store.</p>
<p>Well, actually it is a surprise. BB10 uses Qt as main framework. The version of Skype for Nokia N9 (MeeGo) is also written in Qt (just like the version for PC Linux).<br />
Porting that version over should be very simple.</p>
<p>UI-wise yes but I guess most of the system APIs are different, given that MeeGo is based on Linux while BB10 is based on <span class="caps">QNX</span>. And given that there already is an App around that mostly should work inside the compatibility layer it seems the effort required to get that to run is not as big as porting the whole backend code from Linux to <span class="caps">QNX</span>. Skype has most of it&rsquo;s complexities there instead of on the UI level.</p>
<p>Personally i too find the best way to run the best Android OS of all (gingerbread v2.3 from 2011) is to buy a 2013 blackberry. Thx guys!!</p>
<p>The Eclipse emulator probably does just as well, if not better</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">SDK</span> emulator is probably way more stable than BB&rsquo;s ported runtime.</p>
<p>Bad BlackBerry.  No cookie.</p>

<p>Duuuuuuude. They should totally take the 110 to Sepulveda, then like&hellip;hang a left on Palos Verdes Blvd, roll down the passengers side window, and throw that blackberry into the ocean bro.</p>
<p>Last I checked Skype is made by BlackBerry</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Sorry, I figured the sarcasm tag was unnecessary.</p>
<p>To reiterate, Skype is owned by MS (who is a direct competitor with BlackBerry) so raging on BlackBerry for not having Skype is kind of ridiculous.</p>
<p>Y&rsquo;all need to check again&hellip;.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re expecting microsoft to make a crap Skype app do b10, you must be joking</p>
<p>I guess all you have todo is sideload a launcher onto a Blackberry Device and you have a Android Device!</p>
<p>Could BlackBerry be any more of a joke right now? If the performance of Android apps on The Verge review is consistent among all Android apps, that&rsquo;ll be horrible.</p>
<p>Which Android apps were tested by the Verge?</p>
<p>It was my understanding that there was a difference between Android apps ported to the platform and Android apps that run within the emulator.</p>
<p>Which one is this?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a compatibility layer. Similar to Wine.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand what the emulation layer is. But Blackberry World contains apps that were ported to the platform from Android (Retain Android styling, 0 code differences between the Android app and the Blackberry app except the ones necessary for the port) and <span class="caps">ALSO</span> contains apps that haven&rsquo;t been ported to the platform and instead run in an Android 2.3 software emulation layer.</p>
<p>These are two completely different things. The headline reads that Skype on BB10 will be an Android port, but then down in the article they lament that it will run within the emulator. It&rsquo;s either one or the other, it cant be both. Unless I&rsquo;m just completely wrong, in which case none of this matters.</p>
<p>Too my knowledge this difference does not exist. BB10 implements a Dalvik VM, similar to what Alien Dalvik did on MeeGo. Porting Android Apps to this mainly means resolving compatibility issues (similar to those some WP7 Apps have on WP8). Theoretically you could do a native App while retaining the Android styling but that would be a complete rewrite and they could adapt to BB10 styling anyway.</p>
<p>Have you got some source on that difference?</p>
<p>No, that was what I gathered from the announcement and all of the news before the launch.</p>
<p>Surely those &ldquo;Port-a-thons&rdquo; that they were holding before the launch weren&rsquo;t just to port apps over to be run inside the Android Compatibility Layer were they? If true, that&rsquo;s even worse than I thought.</p>
<p>I just looked through the Dev Doku on that but basically it seems everything is using that compatibility layer. I don&rsquo;t know how well you know the technical side of Dalvik but basically those ports seem to consist of compatibility checks (to ensure only supported APIs are used (not all 2.3.3 APIs are fully implemented) and to repackage them for App World because a different package format is used).</p>
<p>See: <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/documentation/mastertopic_1849583_11.html" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android/documentation/mastertopic_1849583_11.html</a></p>
<p>I see. Very interesting. Thanks for the head&rsquo;s up. Definitely not good for BB10. Good thing I&rsquo;m a WP8 fan &gt;:-)</p>
<p>Would not be that bad if it worked properly. As Ladoodle mentioned it is not really emulation but simply another VM implementation. Similar to Java Applications running the same on Windows, Linux and MacOS. But it seems from the tests to be a worse implementation &ndash; perhaps <span class="caps">JIT</span> compilation is missing (Google added that with Android 2.2). But thats just an asumption.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an emulator. It has an Android runtime that implements a Dalvik VM to create a compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Similar to Wine. Which allows Windows apps to run on Linux/Unix but isn&rsquo;t actually an emulator. There&rsquo;s even an application that allows you to sideload APKs onto the Z10.</p>
<p>Ah, I see. Thanks for clearing that up!</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t sideload .apk files to BlackBerry 10 anymore. You have to re-package them to .bar format first, but it&rsquo;s relatively easy to do. All you can sideload then are .bar files only. You can&rsquo;t browse Google Play and download whatever either.</p>
<p>gingerbread v2.3 !!! <span class="caps">YAY</span>!</p>
<p>The Skype app for Android itself still works even on 2.1. Which was called Eclair&hellip; By far most Android apps in the Playstore work on 2.x or even 1.x and do not use any 4.x functions at all because only a minority of Android device owners could use them.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LOL</span></p>
<p>At this point they should have just saved their time and made their own Android phones with their own custom overlay, like Touchwiz, and Sense, that utilized their BB services&hellip; It&rsquo;d run all the Android apps perfectly.</p>
<p>But that would&rsquo;ve been <span class="caps">TOO</span> easy</p>
<p>And totally unsecure.</p>
<p>Seems to be secure enough for <a href="http://gcn.com/Articles/2012/01/16/Army-mobile-secure-Android-authentication.aspx">DoD</a></p>
<p>This is old news. Yet they still certified more BB7 devices later:<br /><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/10/blackberry-7-smartphones-get-dod-army-military-approval/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2012/05/10/blackberry-7-smartphones-get-dod-army-military-approval/</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile BB10 already got <span class="caps">FIPS</span> for government use while Android still doesnt have it for the OS in general.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FIPS</span> is just a security certification with 140-1 and 2 dealing with encryption it doesn&rsquo;t mean a device is secure, it allows for apps to be written/tested against a known encryption level.</p>
<p>Is the iphone less secure than BB7?</p>
<p>I just said BB10 already got <span class="caps">FIPS</span> certification and Android as a whole did not. This is just a fact.</p>
<p>As for the iPhone: what has the iPhone to do with the suggestion made above that BB should use Android? Which I was answering. Did you read that at all?</p>
<p>Apple would never license iOS to BB anyway. So this point is moot.</p>
<p>You do realise that <span class="caps">FIPS</span> just covers modules rather than the whole OS? So there is no reason why Blackberry could not have made a <span class="caps">FIPS</span> certified Android device.</p>
<p>You brought BB7 up as being so secure because of <span class="caps">FIPS</span>, the iphone is not <span class="caps">FIPS</span> certified so with that in mind is it any less secure?</p>
<p>No I have not written a single word about BB7 being secure because of <span class="caps">FIPS</span>. I only mentioned that BB10 got <span class="caps">FIPS</span> certification while Android as a whole has not got it. Again this is just a fact. Also I pointed to a news article which reported that the DoD continued to approve even more BB7 devices last year.  Again these are facts.</p>
<p>You just don&rsquo;t read what I write.</p>
<p>Also nowhere did I say that BB could not get <span class="caps">FIPS</span> certification for an Android device.</p>
<p>What I wrote was that Android is not as secure as BB10. But not based on the <span class="caps">FIPS</span> certification. Just because you don&rsquo;t read what I write <strong>you</strong> claimed I made this connection while in fact I did not. This answers also your pointless question about the iPhone. I have not claimed with a single word that <span class="caps">FIPS</span> makes the OS more secure. I just mentioned that BB10 has it while Android as a whole does not have it.</p>
<p>I just repeat this in the hope you stop putting words into my mouth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also I pointed to a news article which reported that the DoD continued to approve even more BB7 devices last year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do read what you write and you wrote certified, not approved &ndash; that&rsquo;s what threw me as <span class="caps">FIPS</span> is one of two certifications used by DoD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I wrote was that Android is not as secure as BB10.<br />
Yet it is secure enough for the <span class="caps">DOD</span>? <br />
So why is Android less secure than BB10?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so you just jumped on my usage of the word &ldquo;certified&rdquo; as if &ldquo;certified&rdquo; automatically means certified for <span class="caps">FIPS</span> 140-2. I don&rsquo;t know what the correct term in the US is but here in Germany when a device is allowed to be used by the government it gets a kind of formal certification (Zertifizierung). Approval means you got this Zertifizierung. Which could include in the fine print complicance to certain standards like <span class="caps">FIPS</span> 140-2 which have to be get in advance. I assume it is similar in the US.</p>
<p>But whatever the correct terminology is still I did not mention BB7 and <span class="caps">FIPS</span> in the same sentence. The article I pointed to did talk about the DoD and did not talk about <span class="caps">FIPS</span> or <span class="caps">NIST</span> at all. Last but not least I did not wrote a single word about OS security being connected alone to <span class="caps">FIPS</span> certification. Nevertheless you put all these claims into my mouth just because you saw a word?</p>
<p>No, I do not believe you have read what I wrote. But I&rsquo;m used to that in the comment section of the Verge.</p>
<p>DoD has not approved Android in general. It has approved only certain devices (out dated when they got the DoD compliance approval / certification whatever it is called) and only when certain modifications are done to them which btw. includes removing of the Playstore.</p>
<p>So why Android is less secure than BB10:</p>
<p>The short answer is because BB10 is designed to be solid on security from the ground up. This always has been the core competency of <span class="caps">RIM</span>/BB. They have features like Blackberry Balance. Google it.</p>
<p>Android was never designed with security in mind which has been proved again and again by countless numbers of exploits. Android is just based on a normal Linux kernel.</p>
<p>I missed the 90 sec window:</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>, the DoD manated in their approval that &ldquo;&hellip;classified information cannot be sent, received or accessed by Android handsets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for Android is &ldquo;secure enough for the DoD&rdquo; &hellip;</p>
<p>That might have to do with the fact that everyone can do whatever they like to the system before slapping it onto a device. That is also the reason why on the Desktop a Distro like Redhat might be certified but Linux as a whole is not.</p>
<p>Not exactly the same since Android flavors are much closer to each other than Linux distros. But yes, iOS and WP fanboys like to call this the &ldquo;fragmentation&rdquo; of Android. While it is often exaggerated there is certainly some truth to it which can cause long term support problems in IT departements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Google could go for these kind of certifications with the base OS if they choose to do so. But they couldn&rsquo;t be bothered yet.</p>
<p>lol thats a joke<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>No one is going to use blackberry.</p>
<p>Apparently 55% of shops in the UK selling the BB Z10 sold out. But that could mean them shops only had a half a dozen devices or so.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t underestimate brand loyalty. Britain is one of Blackberry&#8217;s biggest markets and <span class="caps">BBM</span> is massively popular here.<br />
I would suggest its kinda a half way house though. Not a huge number of devices and demand due to the wait time for BB10.<br />
Lets see what the numbers are like in three months, when supply isn&#8217;t an issue.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t that turn out to be a lie though?<br /><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/9853190/BlackBerry-10-shops-deny-claims-by-Thorsten-Heins-that-Z10-phones-are-selling-out.html" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/9853190/BlackBerry-10-shops-deny-claims-by-Thorsten-Heins-that-Z10-phones-are-selling-out.html</a></p>
<p>Nope &ndash; just people manipulating the stock market <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/07/blackberry-z10-phones-4u-sales/" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/07/blackberry-z10-phones-4u-sales/</a></p>
<p>Yeah, they limited their devices! It&rsquo;s mostly a lie! Read the link that @razormike posted.</p>
<p>Pathetic</p>
<p>This is really disappointing, as so many people have said apps need to focus on quality not quantity and any android I&rsquo;m sure will lack the former while running on a Z10 or Q10.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easier to state a big number then getting people to recognize that there are lots of great Apps. And this is what Blackberry did. But I agree that we would all be happier with 10quality Apps than with a 1000 crappy ones.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you, it definitely sounds way better and sales people I&rsquo;m sure love to chuck in that fact.</p>
<p>I have a Blackberry z10 and its a fantastic device&hellip;.no amount of nasty hipster comments will change that. your loss.</p>
<p>Do you use the android apps or just native apps? I was tempted by the Q10 but if key apps like skype are just android points that puts me off a little. Also do android apps even support a 720&times;720 screen?</p>
<p>As if people actually use Skype.</p>
<p>Yup 30 million users along with 10 million or so paid users means nothing. Microsoft just threw away 8.5 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Close to 1 billion registered users, stupid!<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype</a></p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t nothin but a heartbreak.</p>
<p>I want it that way.</p>
<p>Tell me why.</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t nothin but a mistake.</p>
<p>Tell me why.</p>
<p>People need to chill out about the numbers&hellip; BB spent a long time making the android runtime work effectively. I have Android apps that work just as well if not better than some native ones (good code makes for good apps; crappy code=crapps).  As for skype, reports (N4BB) are that the BB and Skype teams are working very closely and that the port is a heavy tweak of the android app (e.g. the action bar look nearly identical to that of a native BlackBerry 10 app). Performance is said to be enhanced by the fact that its running on an updated Jellybean runtime.</p>
<p>keep hating but this sums up why the z10 is very good even awesome: from Ewan at Mobile industry review.  Somehow the verge, and engadget and a few others missed this.  They dont know how to review a phone period, too busy doing stuff only blog writers do, and not what the rest of the world does. shame.<br />
1. The back case is plastic. Nice quality, but plastic. Which is good. Because my BlackBerry is a tool for getting stuff done. I want to be able to toss it on the table without fearing a scratch.<br />
2. I really like the fact the Z10&prime;s <span class="caps">NFC</span> &lsquo;receiver/transmitter&rsquo; is BlackBerry logo on the back of the case.<br />
3. I <span class="caps">LOVE</span> the fact there&rsquo;s a removable battery. <span class="caps">LOVE</span> it.<br />
4. The on screen keyboard is simply the best I&rsquo;ve ever used, bar none. Bar none. It&rsquo;s fast, it&rsquo;s incredibly accurate and I really, <span class="caps">REALLY</span> like the fact you can more or less type whole sentences without spaces and the system will parse it for you. The amount of times I&rsquo;ve written somethinglikethis and then had to do about 21 keypresses to delete the word&hellip; gah. The BB10 keyboard parses somethinglikethis into &ldquo;something like this&rdquo; immediately without any thinking on your part.<br />
5. Uniformly across the UI is the facility to turn &lsquo;on&rsquo; password display &mdash; it&rsquo;s just a little eye icon at the right of any password field. I can&rsquo;t tell you how nice that makes setting up accounts. I have some complicated passwords!<br />
6. When you&rsquo;re entering passwords, the keyboard automatically expands to place a numerical row on top of the standard <span class="caps">QWERTY</span> input. Duh. Of course. This is a slap-head-stupidly-smart touch. Of <span class="caps">COURSE</span>. I really don&rsquo;t enjoy having to constantly swap alpha to numerical keyboards every time I enter a password. Smart thinking, <span class="caps">RIM</span>.<br />
7. The device feels chunky &mdash; it&rsquo;s got a nice weight to it. A nice solidity. I feel confident in it&rsquo;s abilities. I don&rsquo;t feel concerned about damaging it. It doesn&rsquo;t feel as fragile as the iPhone or a Galaxy <span class="caps">SIII</span>. It feels robust. Just what I want in a communications tool.<br />
8. I really enjoy the thumb-interface. Hold the device in one hand and you can switch on the screen and peak at your email in a single fluid movement.<br />
9. There&rsquo;s no home button. No buttons to speak off (apart from those on the shell). To activate the device you simply swipe up from the BlackBerry logo on the bottom bevel. Bang. The screen appears and as you swipe up, the last screen you were using is slowly revealed in a rather pleasing blur. Pleasing enough to show off repeatedly to everyone you meet  <br />
10. The sleep function is really nice: Plug the device in and pull down the &lsquo;night&rsquo; option and an attractive, minimalist analog clock appears in pleasing red colours but at a very low light level so the brightness doesn&rsquo;t keep you awake. That stays active the whole time unless you specifically switch off the screen with the top button.<br />
11. The BlackBerry Hub is now your central inbox to rule them all. It&rsquo;s really nice to see it realised in glorious &ldquo;HD&rdquo; quality on the Z10 screen. Indeed it feels slightly surreal looking at the familiar <span class="caps">RIM</span> icons in high quality.<br />
12. The super-app concept is live and well; so apps can easily integrate into your Hub. For instance, you can accept a LinkedIn request directly from the Hub inbox listing. Just tap and it&rsquo;s done. No need to actually fire up the LinkedIn app for that. Similarly with Facbeook and Twitter.<br />
13. I was initially horrified to find that Evernote was missing from BlackBerry World (the new App World name). Until I remembered that Evernote is baked in. It&rsquo;s baked into the operating system now as &ldquo;Reminders&rdquo;. Just put in your Evernote credentials and there you go.<br />
14. I will be dining out on the camera timeshift function for a long time. It works exactly as the team demonstrated on stage at the keynote last year. It&rsquo;s brilliant.<br />
15. Everything&rsquo;s ready for 2013. The built-in sharing is excellent and fully functional. There are no compromises as with the last versions of the OS.<br />
16. Video calling from <span class="caps">BBM</span> rocks. What&rsquo;s <span class="caps">EVEN</span> <span class="caps">FLIPPING</span> <span class="caps">BETTER</span> is the ability to share your phone screen with the other party. Yes, you read that right. &ldquo;Desktop sharing&rdquo; of your BlackBerry. Heh. Really useful if you&rsquo;re trying to make a point or demonstrate something. Or show off a particular email.<br />
17. The browser is fast. Very, very fast. I think I&rsquo;m right in saying it&rsquo;s the best HTML5 compliant browser bar none. It&rsquo;s really enjoyable.<br />
18. I was concerned about how to attach the BlackBerry to an old BES5 server. I shouldn&rsquo;t have worried. BB10 now has ActiveSync support &mdash; so provided you&rsquo;ve got that enabled on your Exchange server, you&rsquo;ll be fine. A nice move from <span class="caps">RIM</span>.<br />
19. BlackBerry World is looking good. I&rsquo;m going to try out some of the TV and movies, all supplied by Rovio. (I won&rsquo;t yet comment on the app selection as I want to make sure it&rsquo;s all live and operational first.)<br />
20. DropBox support also appears built-in but I&rsquo;ll need to confirm that. It looks that way. I haven&rsquo;t had to download an app to get it working. Box is installed by default, along with DocsToGo. Editing a PowerPoint on your BlackBerry is now a realistic proposition.<br />
21. For the first time ever, a video sent to me from an iPhone played without any jiggerypokery on a BlackBerry. As I commented above, BB10 is 2013-ready. Small things like this were missing from the older devices. They were capable, but only if the videos were formatted in a particular manner and so on. Now it&rsquo;s seamless. And the screen is wonderful.<br />
22. I like the Inbox delete function &mdash; they&rsquo;ve placed it bottom right so it&rsquo;s quick to access all the time. On that point, I do miss the keyboard shortcuts but the touchscreen definitely makes up for it.<br />
23. The touchscreen just works. No lag, no messing around, no compensation required from me. And no double swiping because the system didn&rsquo;t detect your first swipe. It&rsquo;s all perfect.</p>

<p>You could have just posted a link to your myspace page with your fantasy story that you just wrote!</p>
<p>Thornston? Is that really you? Wouldn&rsquo;t your time be better spent speaking to the huge crowds at Canadian BB10 launches?</p>
<p><a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/lackluster-start-for-blackberrys-new-phone-in-canada/">Oh wait.</a></p>
<p>When you come out of high school one day, maybe you&rsquo;ll realize there&rsquo;s more to tech than lining up in front of a store. The article you posted was updated with a more positive outlook in any case. It&rsquo;s freakin winter in Canada &ndash; the real sort of winter. People in stores can look, buy or seek support. Drawing a conclusion from the number of people you see in the store is simply ridiculous.</p>
<p>I use the Skype app on my Nexus 7 sometimes. I struggle with the UI, the other day it was ringing from some stranger and I couldn&rsquo;t even figure out how to discard it, I closed the app and it kept ringing, I had to freaking shut down the tablet lolll. The UI is a mess, with long presses to do stuff, other things in submenus &ndash; I just don&rsquo;t understand. I prefer it on linux or windows, where it works pretty good.</p>
<p>Its a mess on windows and Linux too. The Skype app on any platform just sucks</p>
<p>Since the Verge seem to lazy to do much leg work, go to somewhere who has better <a href="http://n4bb.com/skype-blackberry-10-excellent-android-port/">information</a></p>
<p>Here is a sorta related but very important question&hellip;.when is Skype coming to Outlook.com? First, I thought it would come on Oct 26, then I thought maybe Jan 29, well now I am praying it comes on Mar 15. In every way, I have been disappointed with Skype under Microsoft. Now I am seriously wishing Amazon was the one who brought it. Even this porting an Android version of Skype instead of making a naive version seems like laziness. Also, when is the Skype coming to the X360 (and PS3)? I would assume under Microsoft, Skype innovation would be accelerating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure app performance will be phenomenal.</p>
<p>You forgot &ldquo;/s&rdquo;</p>
<p>70k bb apps most of if being port over.  Is that what their developer program was?  To sackride google apps instead of actually promote getting real developed apps for the BB10 OS?</p>
<p>THis is quite sad.  At least WP8 has good 3rd party apps.  BB doesn&rsquo;t have much 1st party, 3rd party, 2nd party, mario party apps.  They got poverty apps from Google that are old android versions.  Probably similar to me playing super punch out with an emulator on my dell computer.</p>
<p>What a terrible spin.</p>
<p>I take it this is from firsthand use right?</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span> 40% does not = most</p>
<p>And windows phone does not have great or even good third party support.</p>
<p>Working so close but no close enough to build a native app. Lol.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That could be disappointing news for BlackBerry 10 owners who use Skype; as we found out in our review of the Z10, ported Android apps aren&rsquo;t implemented very well, and are based on a version of Android that&rsquo;s almost two years old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the Verge somehow does not get is that the original Skype app on Playstore itself runs on 2.1 and doesn&rsquo;t require 4.x at all. By far most Android apps in the Playstore still work on 2.&times;. This is because most Android phones out there do not have 4.x yet and many will never get it:<br /><a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a></p>
<p>The funny things is that in fact it is likely that BB10 customers will get 4.1 support sooner than most Android owners.</p>
<p>yep!</p>
<p>Well, what else could Blackberry done? It&#8217;s the best they could have done. At least BB10 users have the apps that work.</p>
<p> Yet, Skype on wp8 and Win8 is still horrible.</p>
<p>Poor BB&hellip; getting bullied by the press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BB10 doomed &mdash; not as many apps as Android.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So BB adds the Android Skype app.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BB10 doomed because Android Skype app sucks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>/smh</p>
<p>This is a disaster in the making. I give the company BlackBerry less than two years before they fail. And divest themselves of all patents and technology that they had created along the company&#8217;s entire span.  This I&#8217;ve spoken so shall it be done. :-/</p>
<p>They really need to stop with this port mumbo jumbo. Develop your own apps for Christ&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>I think this article is worded for maximum blackberry bashing. But I actually own the Z10&hellip;.and its a fantastic device, in fact id say alot of the android ported apps i didnt even know they were, they worked so well. Its pretty obvious <span class="caps">QNX</span> is going to be the future of mobile computing&hellip;.they&rsquo;re already poised to take over automobile tech going forward. I am surprised Verge keeps people in the dark on this development.</p>
<p>As far as the skype app goes&hellip;.this &ldquo;android port&rdquo; will be in a 4.1 jelly bean emulator and will work flawlessly. You &ldquo;wannabe tech&rdquo; guys can bash Blackberry all you want, but this phone is selling and there is nothing snarky comments can do to stop it. cheers.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about the random trolls &ndash; they&rsquo;ve been mostly undone by the positive release and they&rsquo;re feeding off the little crumbs to hide the fact that their platform(s) are becoming somewhat stale. I&rsquo;ll be buying the device pretty soon myself, just saving a bit to shed off a year from the contract, something. I&rsquo;ve noticed FutureShop/Bestbuy is out of stock. Joshua Topolsky was excited with the new OS, as were many other real tech people &ndash; those are the people that count!</p>
<p>I played with a Z10 today but didn&rsquo;t find anything about it compelling.</p>
<p>Even the swiftkey powered keyboard was underwhelming and I like swiftkey.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LOL</span> fail..die Blackberry die.</p>
<p>Skype for Android is pretty stable. At least the 4.0+ version is.</p>
<p>For people with a Blackberry 10 &ndash; FaceFlow is already there. We were the first to provide a text and video chat platform on the BB10, and still the only one (Skype &amp; others not caring enough?)<br />
We&rsquo;re seeing over 700 installs per day; people are being really grateful for the service we provide, and to actually be caring.<br />

<p>As I figured, virtually none of you idiots understand what &lsquo;porting&rsquo; means.  BB 10 gave developers about twelve-teen ways to code, including ways to reuse code.  People, please read something.</p>
<p><strong>You think this is a good idea&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>[Lense Flare] + [Explosion] + [Inception Horn]</p>
<p><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img835/454/itisnot.jpg" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us" /><br /></p>
<p>Not many developers will be ready to develop for iOS + Android + BB10. Right now they have to choose between BB10 and WP8, Having an Android player gives BB10 an upper hand. Eventually once some of the ported apps are successful, they will put in the extra effort to make a native BB10 app.</p>
<p>Or if they just used C/C++ to start with, they could target all 4 platforms.</p>
<p>Honestly, it isn&rsquo;t that hard to port an Objective-C project to BB10 either: <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting_ios_intro.html" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting_ios_intro.html</a></p>
<p>Thing is, I know a lot of people who avoid Objective C. I don&rsquo;t make mobile apps but I imagine i would too</p>
<p>Are these people not building iOS apps? I can&rsquo;t imagine building an iOS app <em>without</em> Obj-C. Apple&rsquo;s Cocoa framework is built for Obj-C. If you want to build an app using just about <em>any</em> of the standard iOS features (like tab bars, navigation controllers, table views, etc), you gotta use Obj-C, or build it from scratch.</p>
<p>The Mono guys have a cross-platform development tool that they claim gives pretty good results&mdash;converting C# to Objective-C, including (most of? many of?) the interfaces to iOS routines.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have personal experience with it, but the Mono team seems <span class="caps">AWFULLY</span> sharp. It&rsquo;s at least imaginable to do it that way.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t used Mono at all. I may have heard of it before, but I never really looked into it.</p>
<p>I personally think that building &ldquo;cross-platform&rdquo; apps is bad practice because each platform has different UI conventions. For instance, I think I could count the number of good cross-platform desktop applications on one hand, and they&rsquo;re mostly web browsers.</p>
<p>My philosophy is that if you want to build a good app for more than one platform, build <em>separate</em> apps for each platform. You&rsquo;ll end up with a better user experience for <em>all</em> your users.</p>
<p>Also, it looks like Mono costs at least $400 if you want to publish your app. Otherwise you&rsquo;re limited to dicking around in the simulator.</p>
<p>You may actually be surprised at what tools exist. There are solutions being made to all things in the world and cross-platform development is one such topic. You can get some great performance from these tools on par with natively built products. It&rsquo;s all a matter of how efficiently you implement these things.</p>
<p>You have to look at it from the point of view from businesses. They don&rsquo;t have a lot of time or maybe even the manpower/resources to devote to developing native apps for all of the major platforms in their native languages. If they could find a solution that would allow them to develop their application on a universal level and penetrate each platform, then you can be damn sure they&rsquo;re going to go for that solution, even if they have to shell out a lot of money. Because in the end, they&rsquo;ll make up what they lost if their app is successful (and much more if it&rsquo;s readily available on all the major platforms).</p>
<p>I mean take a look at something like Xamarin which costs an arm and a leg, but gives you so much damn development power that you don&rsquo;t know what to do with: <a href="http://xamarin.com/" target="_blank">http://xamarin.com/</a></p>
<p>Some people might try to do this in order to keep on using the language they know, however you won&rsquo;t get around ObjC for a native iOS app.</p>
<p>Apart from this: ObjC is a fantastic language. :)</p>
<p>Even less would be interested to develop for it, since they don&rsquo;t need to. Just write for Android, man&hellip;</p>
<p>That would be fatal. Remember OS/2. A brilliant system, could run windows binaries, too&hellip;</p>
<p>The whole point of Apps is to have a perfectly bespoke experience. When you start running apps meant for some other platform you lose all the benefits and get all the drawbacks (that Google and others keep going on about) not to mention that the apps will probably like crap. This is just an easy way to inflate app numbers for bragging rights.</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10 won&rsquo;t survive without the Android runtime for sure&hellip;</p>
<p>It definitely won&rsquo;t save it, they run like shyt.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting, is that its actually possible to sideload Android APKs.</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10 won&rsquo;t survive because of the Android runtime for sure&hellip;</p>
<p>(no one will buy BB10 devices to run Android 2.x apps)</p>
<p>  What percentage of Android apps target 4.0+ only?</p>
<p>A lot more of them and the number just keeps getting larger.</p>
<p>Yes, developers really don&rsquo;t care about <strong>the overwhelming majority of Androids today</strong> that aren&rsquo;t running 4.X Android&mdash;probably will <span class="caps">NEVER</span> get upgraded for it, for whatever reasons. Those egotistical devs are all about bragging to their buddies about how cute some new feature is in their app, regardless of whether anybody buys/uses it.</p>
<p>No wonder they don&rsquo;t worry about making any money; if they wanted to, they&rsquo;d develop their apps to make use of 4.X if it was available, and fall back to an approach as good as possible if it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure but I would guess less than 5%. According to Google themselves more than 60% of Android devices in the wild are still running on 2.&times;.</p>
<p>Verge often have Nexus devices in their mind which in reality only a tiny minority of people are using.</p>
<p>Most importantly, google chrome.</p>
<p>The BB10 browser is the most compliant compliant browser available</p>
<p>whoopdy-frickin&rsquo;-do&hellip;can I sync it with Chrome on my desktop</p>
<p>But performance vise, they&rsquo;re not the best. Ars technica ran tests using the Google Octane test and the Mozilla Kraken test and it lost on both.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BB10-vs-S3-charts.006.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/BB10-vs-S3-charts.005.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I would rather trust Google regarding compliance and for browser performance. Their entire business relies on the web and performance and compliance is the the most important for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Ars, and that report in particular was useful.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re <span class="caps">NOT</span> comparing the BB browser to Chrome; you&rsquo;re showing (Ars&rsquo; point) that the <span class="caps">CPU</span> in the BB10 is <strong>probably</strong> neither cutting-edge nor sluggish, in the middle of the pack.</p>
<p>In fact, the Ars piece doesn&rsquo;t say much about how <span class="caps">ANY</span> app will run as the Dalvik or other VM running Android/java will slow it down versus a good native (C++ or Objective-C) version.</p>
<p>If you throw around this sort of stuff, you should understand it better.</p>
<p>Android is a lot more advanced OS and so is iOS and WP. Though, WP has not advanced as far as iOS or Android. BB10&rsquo;s concept is flawed from my view and by a lot. Android updates come like Wildfire. Blackberry won&rsquo;t be able to keep up at this right. Also, there&rsquo;s the difference in kernels which affect performance. BB10 (<span class="caps">UNIX</span>) Android (Linux)</p>
<p>It just needs to target the most used <span class="caps">API</span> in Android, not the most recent one.</p>
<p>What is flawed about the BB10 concept?</p>
<p>And most Android phone models don&rsquo;t get any updates at all.</p>
<p>Lol you clearly don&#8217;t know bb10 is <span class="caps">QNX</span> which is 100,000 lines of code and they can fix one code and update that code, android uses Linux which has 8 million lines of code and is way harder to find and fix a problem. <span class="caps">QNX</span> is the only <span class="caps">RTOS</span>. Do some research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BlackBerry 10 won&rsquo;t survive because of the Android runtime for sure&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could save commenting time with more succinct statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackberry 10 won&rsquo;t survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, I think it&#8217;s the other way around, BB won&#8217;t survive if they keep relying on other platform&#8217;s apps. Android apps has enough problems of their own, security issues, bad/no quality assurance, malwares, etc. Let alone running them on a non-native runtime. For a quick start it&#8217;s okay, but in the long term it&#8217;s not a good idea at all.</p>
<p>yeah that stuff is just killing Android</p>
<p>wait..what? one-point-how-many-million activations per day?</p>
<p>Blackberry need to grow a pair and go native apps only.</p>
<p>This stuff is bad for developers, bad for customers and bad for Blackberry.</p>
<p>1. If I was an Android developer, I wouldnt be happy with the experience of my app on the Z10.<br />
2. It&rsquo;s confusing and offers bad experiences to customers. They won&rsquo;t love the device and won&rsquo;t buy Blackberry next time.</p>
<p>If you were an Android developer and were not happen with the experience of your app on the Z10, then wouldn&rsquo;t you develop that native app for BB10?</p>
<p>Probably not even worth considering at this point in time.</p>
<p>If you were an Android developer, you would at least make an attempt to try the experience on a Z10 before concluding you wouldn&rsquo;t be happy with it</p>
<p>So survival is dependent on the Android runtime? At which point does this dream end?</p>
<p>Apps are the stupidest thing everyone is so focused on. All a OS maker needs to do is make a great business phone that gets the net, email, camera, a baked In paint like program, an Office like program, plenty of storage, and some other things I know I&rsquo;m forgetting, but doodle ninja fucks can play games on a console. This app bullshit is for the birds now. People keep doing shit to death, apps are meaningless now, I need to tweet, I need to facebook, a society of yappers not doers.</p>
<p>So&hellip; third party software is meaningless.  That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re saying?  Just wondering do you actually own any computing device?</p>
<p>Blackberry has proven itself over the years as a reliable, secure phone OS for corporate and government uses. The new BB10 design, features and more secure OS will be an excellent fit for their niche market while Apple, Android and Windows stay in the consumer grade market. As more hacks and jail breaks come out for Apple, Android and Windows, the business user will choose Blackberry as a more reliable choice. The fact they will support Android 4.1 Jelly Bean apps and runtime will make Blackberry even more interesting for users looking for more secure alternatives.</p>
<p>Dude you look dodgey as fuck posting that. Signed up today with 2 blackberry comments lol</p>
<p>Eventually, huh? Pathetic. With the way they ran in demos, they need to give that dream up and promote better native apps! They&rsquo;re just asking to fail, smh.</p>
<p>Blackberry will officially support Android 4.1 right after Google releases Android 7.2.</p>
<p>Lol bb10 devices will support android 4.2 games before 70% of android devices.</p>
<p>Yeah they won&rsquo;t be able to keep up with the current Android version, heck even Android manufacturers can&rsquo;t keep up with the current Android version.<br />
The should stop promoting this option and encourage developers to go full native.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for Project Stutter when a Z10 runs Android 4.1.</p>
<p>Just stop it Blackberry.  Kill off the Android runtime already!  It is doing nothing but hurting their image because of the inconsistency of Android apps that aren&rsquo;t build for the BB 10 platform.</p>
<p>Just build the Blackberry that we want. I don&rsquo;t want a mini Xbox that can make calls.</p>
<p>1000 Native Apps&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Only 40% of there apps are android ports the rest are all native. And they have 90% of the top 1000% apps on iOS/android.</p>
<p>This is crap for devs</p>
<p>Who cares which version Google is up to, developers are going to use earlier version of the <span class="caps">API</span> for compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>Blackberry maybe stand to benefit from newer Android APIs earlier than most current gen android phones out there.</p>
<p>Just put stock Android 4.1 on it.</p>
<p>and join the legion of OEMs playing second-fiddle to Samsung?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather push my own thing honestly. Or join a niche like WinPho or webOS eventually</p>
<p>WinPho is no niche. It&rsquo;s a small pie with loads of OEMs trying to take a chunk of it. WebOS is not worth it. At most I would go with Tizen or Jolla OS, which are based on open-source software and could be easily deployed.</p>
<p>But I said webOS eventually, not right now. I still consider WinPho a niche. Microsoft don&rsquo;t have the <span class="caps">XBOX</span> Music + Video user numbers to challenge iTunes. They don&rsquo;t have the SkyDrive usage numbers to challenge DropBox, the WinPho platform has just enough numbers to challenge BlackBerry. Its still a niche I think &ndash; but I like it and I&rsquo;m committing to it</p>
<p>Slightly, bb still the 3rd top OS and has about 40+ million more users then then</p>
<p>Android 4.1 is still to this day buggy, promote native apps please BlackBerry, even at the expense of overall app numbers in BlackBerry world.</p>
<p>No. It&rsquo;s not. You probably meant 4.2</p>
<p>People fail to realize androids apps run in a davlik have type vm which can make apps lag etc, bb10 doesn&#8217;t use that it use a runtime, android vm they created and they check and scan every app before it goes on blackberry world</p>
<p>BB been playing catch up for years , they&rsquo;re pros at this .</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s running Android apps in some virtualization mode with 1/10 of the speed? Why not just put a real Android there and scrap that BB OS if it has nothing else benefits than providing a custom skin to Android apps.</p>
<p>Blackberry has it in reverse. Instead of coding your own OS then trying to duct-tape on compatability with Android, they should be using the Android OS, putting on a blackberry skin and giving only Blackberry certified Android phones access to the <span class="caps">BBM</span> and other awesome enterprise features of Blackberry. Now you have the security and business tools of a blackberry with the app selection/marketplace of Android.</p>
<p>The problem is using Android requires them to open source certain stuff under its Apache license. Blackberry&rsquo;s trump card is their proprietary network, <span class="caps">BBM</span> and security, all which could be compromised by using an open-source OS.</p>
<p>If their security can be compromised by an open source OS then it isn&rsquo;t really security, it&rsquo;s more like obscuring your data.</p>
<p>All of that stopped be a trump card when they lost critical mass in market share. What good is <span class="caps">BBM</span> if none of my friends or work assosciates are on BB? What good is the security if my company has gone to a <span class="caps">BYOD</span> model?</p>
<p>They need to turn all of those into cross-platform services and scrap their hardware division altogether or sell it (and there are already rumors floating in that regard &ndash; <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3899052/rim-may-sell-hardware-division-after-blackberry-10-launch">http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3899052/rim-may-sell-hardware-division-after-blackberry-10-launch</a>)</p>
<p>There is no point in security and <span class="caps">BBM</span> if the underlying system isn&rsquo;t considered the most secure and already has a reputation for being prone to malware, as is the case with Android.</p>
<p>As in the case with Apple iPhone as well. How many times do people install apps from the iTunes app store only to realize later that they get notified every second or have popup ads and other annoying sneak up on them.</p>
<p>I think Blackberry has a great chance at carving its own niche again. More BB models should follow but I think they are making headway.</p>
<p>Blackberry, just build out your own app store with your own apps. Make them solid and stable and you will be better off. The emulated Android apps on BB10 are awful. Blackberry should have focused on bringing a few thousand quality apps to market than trying for a boastful 70,000 crappy apps.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad that they are committed to having support for a version of Android that has already been surpassed. Maybe they can have it out by the time 5.1 comes out&hellip;</p>
<p>Targeting the 4.1 Jelly Bean <span class="caps">API</span> is a good idea. The difference for 4.2 are marginal at best (hence why they kept the JB moniker). Lets hope that with this more quality apps make the jump to BB10.<br />
And The Verge could start adopting a less snarky tone torwards new OSes.</p>
<p>When it comes to Blackberry comments and reports, there&rsquo;s always an air or snarkiness and sarcasm.</p>
<p>Almost all articles have a sarcastic headline or tone &ndash; &lsquo;&hellip;eventually&rsquo; &ndash; whereas if something were eventually planned for iOS or Android but not here today, the headline would simply state that something is coming and leave it at that.</p>
<p>Because Blackberry doesn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;everything&rsquo;, now and better, it is somehow inferior and dead in the water whereas both iOS and Android both have their shortcomings but because they are market leaders it&rsquo;s OK or at least acceptable.</p>
<p>The Blackberry vs. Samsung Superbowl ad is also telling. While the Samsung ad was marginally more entertaining and glib, it was just as pointless as Blackberry&rsquo;s ad. Somehow, Samsung got a pass on that.</p>
<p>I believe it&rsquo;s simply become fashionable to make fun of Blackberry and tech journalists simply play to that instead of just reporting but hey, who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy a little schedenfreude from time to time.</p>
<p>Its disappointing coming from Dan because he is like a freaking enciclopedia of mobile.  I guess he has to follow the bosses opinion.  Joshua is just kooo kooo, and Nilay is Joshuas mini me and just repeats everything Joshua says.  Dieter has been a lot more fair but slient lately.  The skinny guy from England seems medicated or high, and is incoherent most of the time.  So lets wait for Dieter and see.  This phones are very good.</p>
<p>Agreed, sometimes I wonder if what The Verge is trying to do is not report news and interesting piece of the tech world but to become the &ldquo;fashionistas&rdquo; of the tech world.</p>
<p>Blackberry presented an extremely solid product. They just need to keep the momentum. Continuously polish the OS while releasing new hardware regularly (every six months).</p>
<p>They pretty much have already become that over the past few months.</p>
<p>The thing is that it would be really hard to take something that BB says they&rsquo;re going to do and assume anything but a long time horizon and avoid a little snarkiness. Look at all of the delays surrounding BB10. It would also be hard not to take the tone when this just seems like such a hack. So much better for them to focus on native apps than to spend any effort updating a virtualized OS that&rsquo;s going to offer a sub-par experience.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>But Blackberry has earned the scorn by being so, so, so slow to come around to the realities of the market. While I certainly agree that iOS and Android have shortcomings, they are so much more mature in working through those problems than BB because <span class="caps">RIM</span> had its head in the sand for so long.</p>
<p>Blackberry has earned every ounce of skepticism it gets from the tech blogs, and if they want a chance and respect they&rsquo;re going to have to earn that as well.</p>
<p>What a load of hooey. Android 2.x wasn&rsquo;t that great either. I know, I have an Android 2.x phone and it&rsquo;s only OK and I don&rsquo;t recall much scorn regarding that OS. I also recall looking at an Android 1.x device way back and it simply sucked! It took how many years for Android to mature? Three, four?  Where was the scorn and skepticism?</p>
<p>With regards to Blackberry&rsquo;s head in the sand, they bought <span class="caps">QNX</span> back in 2010 so they certainly recognized that they needed to change their OS awhile ago but it takes a lot of time to change a company of that size, especially when you have a massive locomotive which looks like $20 billion + in revenue from the school pushing you in a different direction.</p>
<p>Blackberry certainly has made mistakes and a few big ones but honestly, who doesn&rsquo;t and considering that their significant successes I think they&rsquo;ve earned some balance.</p>
<p>But let me guess, you&rsquo;ve never failed, right? Do you deserve disrespect for your failures?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s the point &ndash; if  BB10 had been released in an environment where it was competing against Android 2.x or iOS 1 or 2, it wouldn&rsquo;t deserve the same level of skepticism and doubt. It wasn&rsquo;t though &ndash; <span class="caps">RIM</span> made more than mistakes &ndash; it made a monumental miscalculation that their OS had such a loyal following that wanted what they were making that they just needed to keep on the same course.</p>
<p>They acquired <span class="caps">QNX</span> in 2010? It&rsquo;s 2013! The iPhone was introduced in 2007 . . . BB10 is 6 years late to market. There&rsquo;s no way BB can expect anything but skepticism about their efforts and words like &ldquo;. . . Eventually&rdquo; in Verge posts.</p>
<p>Sorry if that seems <em>mean</em>, but once BB proves they have an OS that is worthy of unskeptical praise and if they start delivering products in a timely manner, maybe the market and tech journalists will forgive them.</p>
<p>Everybody&hellip;try the phones, tech bloggers love pressing the home button!  Lol!  here are a few pictures for everybody to enjoy.  You wont see this ever posted here because&hellip;.I really dont know, they just hate Canada I guess! lol <br /><a href="http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u1813297/P1010016.jpg" target="_blank">http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u1813297/P1010016.jpg</a><br /><a href="http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u10880/White_Q10.jpg" target="_blank">http://cdn.crackberry.com/sites/crackberry.com/files/u10880/White_Q10.jpg</a></p>
<p>so much negative comments,</p>
<p>whats not to hate for one platform to support a runtime for another, its not like they spend money more wisely elsewhere on celebs, might aswell go towards enriching their platform.</p>
<p>people complain about app numbers, now they complain app quality, tbh they went the right route in getting the numbers first then quality second, theres no way to improve the app if its not even on the phone in the first place, at the same time even high quality apps on other platforms still keep on improving through iterative updates anyway.</p>
<p>Bingo. Blackberry did everything right in the way it launched the platform.<br />
The only thing I can criticize them on is that they should&rsquo;ve been faster and have released still in 2012 (preferably by Black Friday). <br />
Since they weren&rsquo;t able to meet that time frame at least they launched a polished OS whose only serious criticism is a lack of a native high-quality maps app (And before Google Maps even Apple didn&rsquo;t have this) and the quality of some of the apps in the store.</p>
<p>It will still suck! Bought a Lumia for my second phone &amp; its fantastic. iPhone &amp; WP to dominate rest are all junks</p>
<p>I believe this whole Android app support is garbage and will do Blackberry and BB10 more harm than good.</p>
<p>People are going to get this device and will start looking for apps. Naturally they won&rsquo;t find most of their favourite or interesting apps they read about as native ones. So they download the Android ports, without even knowing or understand that those are Android ports.</p>
<p>Suddenly people will realise how horribly they perform (and they really do perform catastrophically, I won&rsquo;t even argue about that), how they don&rsquo;t support certain phone and OS functions and how they don&rsquo;t fit into the systems theme.</p>
<p>And guess what is going to happen? People will blame Blackberry and will say BB10 is garbage because it can&rsquo;t even run their favourite apps smoothly, while the iPhone or their recent Samsung could.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the impression average Joe will get.</p>
<p>Will they be able to port TouchWiz to BB 10? That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m waiting for&#8230;</p>
<p>I think the Android runtime is smart, but Blackberry is handling it wrong.</p>
<p>Android apps should be sideload-only. You shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to submit Android apps to the BB10 store.</p>
<p>That way, as a user, if there&rsquo;s one Android-only app that I <span class="caps">REALLY</span> need, I can install it. But when I&rsquo;m casually browsing the app store to see what&rsquo;s available, I&rsquo;ll only be shown native apps, which will provide a good user experience.</p>
<p>As a developer, I&rsquo;ll have incentive to create native BB10 apps, because I&rsquo;ll know that&rsquo;s the only way to get into the app store.</p>
<p>Everyone wins.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t work in the real world because developers have to make money. Sideloading apps wouldn&rsquo;t allow developers to sell their Android apps to BB10 owners. So they would not make them available at all for BB10 owners. Allowing developers to sell their Android apps on BB World was the only possible way for BB to get Android devs on board.</p>
<p>This is so exciting! Who is going to be able to run Android 4.1 apps first? BB 10 users or the majority of Android users?</p>
<p>&hellip; which begs the question why not just use Android?</p>
<p>Honestly, at this point they probably had less to lose if the just did run it.</p>
<p>The goal of BB10 is not to be another Android. They want developers to target BB10 and they got some big names already.</p>
<p>Supporting Android apps fills the gap which would users prevent to get BB10 because of some specific apps not available in the near future like local apps. With Android support there is always at least one option you can fallback to. It is a smart move. And unlike what the Verge claimed a lot of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Android apps just run under BB10 normally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which they have tested though since they have not mentioned it at all.</p>
<p>I think this is actually a smart move lets be honest there is no way bb10 or wp8 will be able to get 700000 apps in 2 or even 5 years, now if bb10 gets all the major apps which they seem capable of ( they got a lot of them already ) the only thing stoping people from converting from android ( which has the largest user base ) are few apps that the user care about and use regularly which he will be able to still use. So it&rsquo;s a win win situation <span class="caps">IMO</span>.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>
<p>Why do people keep stating that they should promote their native apps when they already do this during their developer conferences, their social networks, their Build for BlackBerry program where they give developers incentives to go native offering them a guaranteed $10K plus prime real estate in the app stores featured section.</p>
<p>Is it because the Verge didnt broadcast that part of the conference and they are unable to think for themselves and do their own legwork?</p>
<p>why ? just use android  then</p>
<p>Welcome top the smartphone race RIM &#8211; everyone else has a 3 to 6 year head start on you, but better late than never . . .</p>
<p>Hating on RIM is so cool.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that was hating.  Just the truth&hellip;</p>
<p>No, the truth is they have managed to keep themselves relevant because of what they have been able to accomplish with the PlayBook, but continue spreading your false opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what they have been able to accomplish with the PlayBook</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have one.  Bought it the day it came out.  Worst tablet ever, and I think the sales figures and resale value will agree with me.  You can get a 16gb playbook for less than $50 second hand because nobody wants them.  Blackberry survived by their enterprise services, which have been overrun by equal services on better devices.</p>
<p>They accomplished more with the playbook, for themselves, than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Playbook is like BB10 v0.0.0; it&rsquo;s BB10 before BB10.</p>
<p>BB10 isn&rsquo;t new is what I&rsquo;m saying, RIM has experience, a lot of people have owned Playbooks, they&rsquo;ve got a lot of feedback, and the platform is good for developers.</p>
<p>Say what you will, have your own opinions, it&rsquo;s all fine and dandy. For me, I&rsquo;ve personally found great success on the Playbook. But surely, my success is a fluke, and my opinion is in the minority. Also, my success is most likely a failure to about 99% of the readers on this site.</p>
<p>My point (and I keep making this same point over and over, not just here but on other tech sites): Things can be successful in more than one measurable method. You say cash, I say experience. You say look at competitors, I say look inside. It starts within the business, and that&rsquo;s where it ends. Playbook is a failure to you because it didn&rsquo;t sell 200M devices, but to RIM, it was one hell of a fun time I&rsquo;m sure! It was super learning experience for them. You think companies don&rsquo;t need experience to learn? Think again&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Playbook is a failure to you because it didn&rsquo;t sell 200M devices</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think they said it was a failure to them because it wasn&rsquo;t a very good tablet, but please continue to spread your false opinion.</p>
<p>A failure in one direction does not mean failure in other directions. This is true in all facets of life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an opinion, it&rsquo;s more a level of thinking.</p>
<p>Your thinking is the kind of thinking I&rsquo;ve begun to kinda despise in American society over the last decade. It seems to be the the &lsquo;&rsquo;even the losers get a trophy" mentality. From what your previous post said, I think you have confused learning or gaining experience, with success. Failing is sometimes a great thing, because you can learn a lot from your mistakes, but no company would ever say &rsquo;&rsquo;our failure was actually a success, because we learned stuff!". Companies spend a lot of money to learn stuff beforehand so they don&rsquo;t fail.</p>
<p>I hope you are doing well in life because you sound like you have the right type of mentality to be very successful in business.</p>
<p>Like you are suggesting, even if they sold them at cost or even made a small loss it&rsquo;s quite a small price when you consider the amount of research gained from the project and how much it has pushed their QNX platform and helped them learn from mistakes.</p>
<p>Also as for the PlayBook I just wanted to say I&rsquo;ve had one since they first came out and since then I&rsquo;ve bought a TouchPad, iPad, and Transformer Pad and I&rsquo;ve ended up going back to using my PlayBook and selling my other tablet after a month or two each time.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to move away was because I find 7" a little too small but at the end of the day the PlayBook is just a far superior experience to me so I&rsquo;ve always gone back. I use it for several hours every day and am writing this from it now.</p>
<p>What a very uninformed comment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve checked ebay and every playbook is generating 15-30 bids going for more than $100.</p>
<p>As for the Playbook, your comment doesn&rsquo;t hold any water and sounds more like dogma than any kind of reasoned comment.</p>
<p>I own a Playbook and it&rsquo;s an excellent tablet. Fast, great email/cal/contact apps, very good browser, lots of apps. It&rsquo;s missing skype.</p>
<p>No dogma, just facts.  My playbook is unusably slow, even the damn keyboard freezes up.  I can have maybe two tabs open in the web browser before it crashes, and I&rsquo;m no novice user.  I&rsquo;ve flashed every possible version of software.  As far as the $50 thing, you can find them for that price.  My local craigslist has five at $60/each in good condition.  They&rsquo;re useless devices compared to the alternatives.  Facts are facts, and sales figures back up all of my claims.  Enjoy defending a crappy product for no reason.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t seem to have those problems but I&rsquo;m sure that never happens on Android tablets or iPads.</p>
<p>The difference is when something breaks on my android tablet, I have the ability to fix it because the file system is open, and many people have them, so problems are usually fixed quickly.</p>
<p>Hell, Tigerdirect.com via Ebay is selling the 64GB playbook for $189, which was originally a $800 tablet.  If this doesn&rsquo;t show that they failed at being a <strong>consumer product</strong>, I don&rsquo;t know what does.</p>
<p>What has RIM accomplished with the PlayBook?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a PlayBook?</p>
<p>They have accomplished this for their customers&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.goodlightscraps.com/content/funny-animation/funny-animation-4.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>o_o</p>
<p>Is it possible he was agreeing with me and veiling it in some ultra-deep sarcasm?</p>
<p>Go home fxspec06, you&rsquo;re drunk.</p>
<p>My opinion stands.</p>
<p>TheVerge gave the Playbook 6.1/10 @499$ without mail. They gave it 6.7 @199$ with mail. I own this tablet. Aside from a bunch of trolls pretending it&rsquo;s a bad tablet, everyone who has one is quite satisfied &ndash; as hinted by something like <a href="http://www.thenewage.co.za/75200-1021-53-RIMs_PlayBook_surprises_in_sales_and_customer_satisfaction">this</a>.</p>
<p>I bought a PlayBook at launch. I use it more than my Surface or my iPad 3. Best browser and the ability to stream videos to the tv is great. I loved BlackBerry Remote when I had my Bold 9900 but now I have iPhone 5. I&#8217;m looking to switch back to BlackBerry from the iPhone. BlackBerry Z10!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re either lying or an idiot.  Why own 3 tablets with 3 ecosystems?</p>
<p>LOL, The playbook?? for real?? the only thing they accomplished was making one of the worst tablets on the market! and stay relevant?? Rim hasn&rsquo;t been relevant since 2008, they would be lucky if google was even interested in buying them out.</p>
<p>I own a playbook, it&rsquo;s a great tablet, sure it doesnt have alll the apps in the world, but who needs them when you have a browser as good as the playbooks. Plus its pretty sexy and cheap.</p>
<p>I own one too. The browser on it is definitely the best mobile/tablet browser I&rsquo;ve used&hellip;it&rsquo;s on par with Safari on iPad imo, but has Flash support. It&rsquo;s got some got SOME good developer support&hellip;some nice games from EA, indies etc. The mail app works well for me, the browser is excellent, the UI (while not perfect) is fairly intuitive and fun to use. Performance is lacking in 3D apps and Android emulation so that&rsquo;s a minor negative in my books, however, hardware wise, it feels better in the hand, in real life situations than any other tablet I&rsquo;ve used. It doesn&rsquo;t have those razor sharp, cold iPad edges and the rubber is way mroe grip-able than anything else on the market. Nexus 7 feel is not up to par in my opinion &ndash; it feels heavy and is not as grip-able as the Playbook. Battery life seems pretty excellent too &ndash; not sure how long it&rsquo;s meant to last but it gets the job done nicely.</p>
<p>Way to invalidate your own comment The playbook is 25% heavier than the Nexus 7:<br />
Playbook: 425g<br />
Nexus 7: 340g</p>
<p>Not my fault they had their heads in the sand (or some other dark place . . .) for so long. Let&#8217;s be realistic though, the path to extinction is way shorter than the path to success for RIM. It&#8217;s hard to imagine a scenario in which they win enough market share to avoid the fate of WebOS.</p>
<p>I get that RIM is in deep trouble. But what is there to gain for us if RIM goes bankrupt/extinct ?</p>
<p>I prefer to wait and see, maybe they&rsquo;ll come up with something innovative or something good enough that can stirr up the competition.</p>
<p>Not mentioning kicking RIM while it&rsquo;s down is so 2009.</p>
<p>Nothing, the world won&rsquo;t miss them when they&rsquo;re gone! Right now, it&rsquo;s only Android/iOS and sometimes windows phone what people care about!</p>
<p>79 million people who still roll with RIM might, I for one hope YOU don&rsquo;t represent &lsquo;the world&rsquo; because I don&rsquo;t wanna live in a world filled with shortsightedness</p>
<p>79 million on keyboard phones and most of this is in the developing world! If you notice a trend, most startups here in san francisco don&rsquo;t even develop software for blackberry and google doesn&rsquo;t really care even!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you saying nokia has a lot of users, but most of them are dumbphones. Developers mostly only care about users with smartphones so you can monetize via ad platforms, apps, and rich user data. BB10 might bring a richer smartphone platform so later things might change.</p>
<p>Developers aren&rsquo;t the only people in the world.</p>
<p>I said BB10 will probably bring a lot of developers.. Dumbphones are useless for developers and advertisers and therefore considered irrelevant because they don&rsquo;t make money for the original company either it being nokia or rim.</p>
<p>Gameloft&hellip; in San Francisco maybe? &ndash; they make tons of games on BB. True Rovio is not in SF. Well RIM offered some money incentives and there was tons of apps submissions lately! There is business opportunity for complementary development, at least, so it&rsquo;s not about finding a startup that only focuses on BB, whether it&rsquo;s in SF or elsewhere. I&rsquo;ve said before I thought the <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/blackberryworld/">appworld</a> was quite  <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/whyblackberry/">successful</a>.</p>
<p>I mentioned above things might change with BB10 since it&rsquo;s an actual smartphone platform with good multitouch capability, but if you bring the topic of 79 million users, do not include users of keyboard or torch phones. Good smartphone games and apps will use the entire screen. If you considered all users, then Nokia today would probably have the most users in this world. So, BB10 will be RIM&rsquo;s rebirth with a clean slate and a new set of users. BB10 will make more money for RIM than its previous platforms so these users will matter more!</p>
<p>There was nothing to &ldquo;gain&rdquo; from the death of WebOS. But sometimes that happens even when it&rsquo;s not a good thing. They&rsquo;re working from an extraordinary disadvantage right now, and this doesn&rsquo;t appear to be revolutionary &ndash; just catching desperately up.</p>
<p>They may still make it &ndash; but I doubt they&rsquo;ll ever climb out of their newly-minted niche status.</p>

<p>RIM&#8217;s new logo.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think haters say &#8220;welcome&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t find good sarcasm glasses ?</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t work when I&#8217;m just reading text unfortunately&#8230; Thinking about returning them :p</p>
<p>is it safe and have the Unicorn Apocalypse?</p>
<p>I have zero idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3899342/samsung-attacks-blackberry-in-new-ad">Now you have one</a></p>
<p>Ah, much better. The cloud of confusion has lifted.</p>
<p>I have even less of an idea</p>
<p> aobDarkMeta posted the video link for context purposes before you even posted this.</p>
<p>Stop being dumb.</p>
<p>Better yet: Can you close deals with clients AND watch the game at the same time with it? Because if it&rsquo;s not, you know I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;my system&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Your clients provably won&#8217;t want to close a deal with you if you are watching the game&#8230;</p>
<p>If you actually knew what &lsquo;Closing a deal&rsquo; entails, you would know that clients aren&rsquo;t usually there.</p>
<p>Some 25 years ago, I read something like Unisys ICON, based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX">QNX</a> was used in some Canadian schools. Quite nice to see RIM new OS will be relying on the UNIX flavor for taste.</p>
<p>It looks like a Android with a lot of WebOS and a little iOS thrown in. I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
<p>Given that it runs Android Apps and most of what is in App World will be Apps developed for Android I guess it&rsquo;s safe to assume that it will look like and work like Android most of the time.</p>
<p>It runs android apps?</p>
<p>Yes, the BlackBerry PlayBook does too. The Sailfish OS that&rsquo;s coming out in mid-2013 will do too, just a way to have more apps for the users.</p>
<p>Like I can straight up access the play store type thing or have to run something like blue stacks for it to work?</p>
<p>You can not use the play store.</p>
<p>Unless you install the play store&#8230;</p>
<p>So confused.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just install the Play Store. On a custom ROM, it requires the Google Apps package be flashed to the device&rsquo;s system partition and you need root permissions to do so. I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s a similar process on a Playbook.</p>
<p>Some of the apps in the BB app world are Android apps which have been <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/tools/repackaged">repackaged</a> by the developer. They&rsquo;re launched the same way as any other app, but run in some sandbox &ndash; it&rsquo;s transparent but for a few UI elements.</p>
<p>Sideloading .bar files to something like the PB involves using a tool like DDPB Installer. It requires no custom ROM or rooting whatsoever.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you really read my comment. I was responding to the person stating that you can simply install the <em>Play Store</em> onto a device. That&rsquo;s now how the Gapps framework functions. As I don&rsquo;t own a Playbook, I don&rsquo;t really know how the process for doing such a thing would work so I explained the process on an Android device that lacked Gapps.</p>
<p>So, in other words, it looks like no other one single OS that&rsquo;s out in the market.  Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>Haha. When people see something new their first reaction is to compare it with what they already know. It has similarities with other OS&#8217;S but it doesn&#8217;t blatantly copy anyone. I think it looks very thumb friendly and could just use a little bit more work on the aesthetics.</p>
<p>At this point in the game, it&#8217;s almost expected for a struggling company such as RIM to borrow some ideas or at least be heavily influenced by Android, iOS or webOS. Just one more reason why I&#8217;m gradually falling for Windows Phone 8 more and more. It&#8217;s distinctive and completely original.</p>
<p>It looks like they started with Holo, then slapped on all the ugly bits of Android 2.&times;. This is truly atrocious, I see no reason that I&rsquo;d choose this over Android.</p>
<p>A little Windows Phone too. That browser UI looks familiar.</p>
<p>Not that there is anything wrong with a little copying as long as you make some contributions to the smartphone.</p>
<p>Yea, &ldquo;leaked&rdquo;, sure.</p>
<p>Yeah, if anyone truly &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; screenshots, it would be a terrible idea. In fact, just posting a picture of any dev or test device would have gotten them into immediate trouble. Everything is labeled, barcoded, and watermarked. I&rsquo;m sure if this was leaked, the developer has been tracked down by now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played with several of these dev devices, including an upcoming BB OS10 phone. It&rsquo;s super slick, and extremely solid in hand. Think one of the higher end blackberries from last generation, but slimmer and, obviously, fully touch.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure about the interface they have going, though. It seems interesting, but it&rsquo;s definitely completely different than any interface on the market. Their photo face &ldquo;rollback&rdquo; ability works precisely as they describe. It&rsquo;s really quite eerie to be able to select individual faces and dial back and forth.</p>
<p>Yeah it&rsquo;s pretty cool, I do it on my Lumia all the time (Scalado made the technology. RIM licensed it from Scalado. Nokia bought Scalado.)</p>
<p>May as well have left paper printouts of the screenshots at a bar.</p>
<p><em>Total Accident</em></p>
<p>The &ldquo;exposed in full detail&rdquo; headline is a little bit of a stretch. There&rsquo;s nothing new here from what we have seen in leaked videos before. Northing earth shattering.</p>
<p>I like the way it looks. I really hope BB10 is a success, I&#8217;m rooting for RIM to turn themselves around. Lack of a comprehensive ecosystem could very well do them in, unfortunately&#8230;</p>
<p>I just went here to see if anybody still cares about Blackberry. After all, this will be their last hope. After that, they&rsquo;ll have to hop in with either Android or Windows.</p>
<p>I never cared for them since I&rsquo;ve never had a BB device, but I&rsquo;m counting BB10 as a new OS, and I&rsquo;m interested in it in that regard, as I am with Ubuntu or Sailfish, even though they might not have a chance to make a dent in the market.</p>
<p>But I guess a few people still care, I see a lot of fans on Twitter really going crazy over BB10.</p>
<p>I care! I haven&#8217;t had a BB since the days of the Pearl, and I simply love using my Nexus 4&#8230; Bur having the majority of my family using BB, and likely whatever company I end up working at, makes it very attractive with all of the BBM features (voice calling, video conferencing). I like the touch gestures (peak and just swiping up to gradually unlock the screen). I like how RIM still has the most secure devices, I like that I can now easily separate work and personal.</p>
<p>And finally &#8211; a 4.2&quot; flagship phone!!!!</p>
<p>Many of the big companies are moving away from blackberry! Yahoo&rsquo;s ceo Marissa mayer dropped blackberries from company phone options and have moved to either iphones or android phones!</p>
<p>That is only one.  I can&rsquo;t find any hard numbers to present, but BB still owns a large share of fortune 500 companies mobile business which Yahoo is not.  Plus, RIM generates 2.5 times more revenue than Yahoo so perhaps RIM dumped them because Yahoo is sinking ;)</p>

<p>Not sure what your point is?  Sure some companies have changed, but RIM still has more customers than they ever had.  My point was even though RIM may have lost Yahoo, Yahoo is not indicative of some larger extrapolation when RIM still has a majority share of the biz for the world&rsquo;s largest companies especially since Yahoo is in much worse shape than RIM.</p>
<p>His point is that it&rsquo;s far from &ldquo;only one&rdquo;, surely.</p>
<p>I never suggested that there was only one company that choose to switch from Blackberry, I said that Yahoo is only one and is insignificant and isn&rsquo;t really indicative of much and neither is the list above.</p>
<p>The only one of any real significance is Halliburton as they are a Fortune 500 company and have a lot of employees, the rest, just drops in the bucket.  Quantas &ndash; replaced 1300 BB and the NTSB has only 358 employees&hellip;..</p>
<p>Weak arguments at best to show how &ldquo;EVERYONE&rdquo; is &ldquo;ABANDONING&rdquo; when RIM has grown more customers every year it exists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/u-s-agency-gives-blackberry-10-a-chance-after-iphone-coup-7000008741/">U.S. agency gives BlackBerry 10 a chance after iPhone coup</a></p>
<p>I remember how your wall of links from last week is visually offensive &ndash; maybe embedding the links in some opinion would show you have something to say.</p>
<p>Actually, she &ldquo;moved on&rdquo; to iPhones, Android phones or Windows Phones, but I doubt that RIM is losing much sleep about what Yahoo decides to do, either way.</p>
<p>I care, I&#8217;m not a die hard fan. But I&#8217;m interested to see what will be slapped on the table.</p>
<p>Honestly, it looks quite nice. But I don&rsquo;t think it would be enough for me to ever switch. If this was a year or two ago I my might have considered it, but I don&rsquo;t really see how this is much better than the current offerings.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really weird to see it&rsquo;s a big mix between iOS, Android and Windows Phone UI.<br />
I like the settings panel, also the general homescreen. But Blackberry Hubs really looks bad, almost amateur, lacks refinements on the UI.</p>
<p>Really the Hub looks bad; the messages? or active frames? No disrespect, just the first time I heard that.<br />
To me its really the app drawer that looks weak and some color choices. Icons still bother me a bit too.</p>
<p>Looks to me like a mix of all the OS&rsquo;s. There&rsquo;s some Android, some iOS, a little WebOS, and some of it still looks like the older BB OS as well. I haven&rsquo;t decided what I think of it yet. Some of it looks nice, other parts look like they need more refinement. Guess we&rsquo;ll see how it is in motion soon enough.</p>
<p>" Guess we&rsquo;ll see how it is in motion "</p>
<p>What you did there. I see it.</p>
<p>Hmm, saw all the screenshots, and I think I like it. Looks mature (specially when you compare its clock app to the clock app running on Android 4.2 on my GNex), but some things need refinement like others mentioned.</p>
<p>Might just buy me a BB10 device if the price is right, though not sure I&rsquo;ll leave Android for it.</p>
<p>Yes, price is the big question&#8230; If they went for an affordable unlocked off-contract price like Google did with the Nexus 4 I&#8217;d probably jump ship, and make the next Nexus 7 my Android device&#8230; Alas, that seems quite unlikely given how all of the carriers are on board.</p>
<p>blackberry should blackberry. the phone looks fine. OS? no.</p>
<p>I agree, Blackberry definitely needs to Blackberry.</p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackberry should Blackberry&#8221;</p>
<p>You have solved the question we have long sought and answer for. Congrats! You&#8217;re Winner !</p>
<p>More like a bad MeeGo rip off&hellip;but that&rsquo;s just me&hellip;I like MeeGo, and BB10 looks like a not so good implementation of it..just talking about the design/UI, I&rsquo;m sure its pretty smooth.</p>
<p>QNX is very similar to EKA2 .. if I am going to switch from EKA2 to something new, this is the prime candidate.</p>
<p>Nice job RIM.</p>
<p>Disgusting. They could&rsquo;ve completed on the playbook&rsquo;s work  or even steal meego completly instead we get this mishmash of oses that almost look like shitty sense on my one x.</p>
<p>I saw this posted in the Verge Forums. Really good video comparison of BB10 and iOS.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/21/3898814/blackberry-z10-compared-to-the-iphone-by-telekom-presse">linky</a></p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s iPhone, right?</p>
<p>Go RIM! Make that modern smartphone! This is kinda like when your granddad <strong>finally</strong> learns how to use the DVD player. You feel both relieved and a little proud that the old dog actually did it. Whether they are around for long enough to carry on is another matter though.</p>
<p>In action <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK0hWJEr874" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK0hWJEr874</a></p>
<p>As much as I&rsquo;ve despised every BlackBerry that I&rsquo;ve ever been forced to use for work, this does look like a remarkably polished and professional UI. The only thing that seems like a problem to me is the &lsquo;invisible unless you know they exist&rsquo; gestures. I know all the smartphone OSs have some hidden gestures, but it seems that the BB10 ones are really core to being able to use the phone. It&rsquo;s right up there with Microsoft having the hidden corner zones in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Just based on the screenshots though, I think if I was an alien with no experience or knowledge of any of the current smartphone platforms, I&rsquo;d probably be tempted to pick this one based on how it looks. (eurgh&hellip; saying that made me feel dirty) :)</p>
<p>Google and Apple finally come together.</p>
<p>BB10 will fail badly.</p>
<p>All current market offerings (iOS/Android/WP8) are complete crap against it and BB10 is the most advanced mobile OS to date, but the wide public mass of consumers (like the many idiots in this comment thread) won&rsquo;t recognize that, because they only look at the visuals at the surface of the OS. Wether it&rsquo;s power, efficiency, user experience or ease of use, they don&rsquo;t see it. All they see is rounded corners (&gt; iPhone rip-off), some gestures (&gt; Meego/WebOS rip-off), Active Frames (&gt; WP Live Tiles rip-off), icon grid (&gt; iOS rip-off), URL-Bar at the bottom (&gt; WP rip-off) and so on&hellip;</p>
<p>Too bad for RIM that many people are plain dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to buy an iPhone 5, a Lumia 920 and a GS3 and I will slash each of these pieces of crap with a hammer, one after another. Wait for my YouTube upload.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t waste your money.  Wait for rim to close it&#8217;s doors for good and you&#8217;ll have plenty of blackberry devices to destroy for recycling.</p>
<p>You got something wrong. The point isn&rsquo;t to destroy <strong>any</strong> phone, the point is to destroy the <strong>shitty</strong> phones. So your recommendation doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p>I hope you plan on getting another hammer after the Nokia destroys it ;)</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t resist this&hellip;</p>
<p>U mad bro?</p>
<p>No. I&rsquo;m a lead user. I expect a different (better) user experience and overall package than the current mass-market offerings can deliver. For you, a GS3 or iPhone 5 might be gorgeous, for me it&rsquo;s crap.</p>
<p>Well, i wouldn&rsquo;t say that. You must remember that apps attract users, but user&rsquo;s attract apps. That make&rsquo;s it incredibly difficult to launch a new platform these days. It&rsquo;s the reason only 2, maybe 3 ecosystems actually become popular in a given area. (Desktop:mac and windows; mobile: mac and android; Consoles: xbox, ps3, nintendo)</p>
<p>The sampling here is not significant and the public doesn&rsquo;t think or behave like most people here. Finally, there&rsquo;s been many &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention, looks interesting&rdquo; sort of comments. It&rsquo;s quite positive, but the threads are often discouraging.</p>
<p>This forum is NOT representative of the buying public &mdash; it&rsquo;s representative of Android fanboys, iOS fanboys and Windows Phone fanboys who feel threatened, respectively.</p>
<p>RIM has 80 million users &mdash; if even 25% of them buy BB 10 in the first 12 months of availability, it will be a roaring success.</p>
<p>Further, these phones will be available on every carrier out there &mdash; something that no other OS (other than Android) can claim.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if 5 million a quarter is a roaring success. It is a bit hard to find model breakdowns, but that appears to be about 15% of iPhone 4S sales in the first quarter of 2012!</p>
<p>5 million phones a quarter would give RIM twice the global share in smartphones that Apple has in PCs.</p>
<p>One of the more surreal contradictions in tech fandom is the Apple guy who insists that market share and app count should be the two top considerations for purchasing some classes of computing devices (phones and tablets) and a complete non-factor in purchasing another class (PCs). :P</p>
<p>While i don&rsquo;t think this UI looks bad, there&rsquo;s just something about it that makes it seem outdated to me. Maybe it&rsquo;s the font?</p>
<p>Seems to me they could have just bought Palm and WebOS before HP and they would&#8217;ve cut out this whole transition to QNX and BB10.</p>
<p>Bye bye iPhone 5&#8230; Hello BlackBerry Z10!</p>
<p>I have to say, it looks like RIM made some really great ergonomic decisions here. Every time I use a GNex or an L920, I struggle. On the Galaxy, taps on the upper part of the screen are an uncomfortable stretch. Ditto on the Lumia. So having a smaller screen and a UX that acknowledges that your thumbs come up from the bottom of the phone seems like a really big win. Yeah, the pull down gesture might still be a bit clumsy, but the card tossing (I&rsquo;m a webOS nomad), the swiping, and the hub/notification reveal look to be wonderfully natural to execute. If nothing else, fluid multitasking and gestures were a HUGE part of what made webOS so delightful to use, and BB10 really seems to be getting back to some of that.</p>
<p>TL;DR Looks like great ergonomic decisions in BB10.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anyone mentioned this earlier&hellip; But on the new BB10 OS isn&rsquo;t compatible with older BES. This means companies will have to decide if they want to pay for support for new Blackberry tech support, licenses, and devices.  It might be too expensive when you can adopt the BYOD model.</p>
<p>RIM offers a BYOD environment with BlackBerry Mobile Fusion. According to RIMs US Managing Director, a great mass of the Fortune 500 already participate in a BlackBerry 10 trial mode, and the feedback is extremely positive so far.</p>
<p>So with BES10 and Mobile Fusion you can run a BYOD environment with BB10, iOS and Android devices, only if you want to use legacy BBOS devices additionally, you need second BES to support those. Whoever goes the BYOD-way, hasn&rsquo;t legacy BBOS devices anymore <strong>or</strong> uses BES for the legacy models <strong>plus</strong> a second environment for the BYOD phones.</p>

<p>I kinda leave with an empty feeling from the presentation. Heins is a very stiff presenter. Also, the devices were not covered indepth: Quality of the camera? Processor? Amount of Ram? BATTERY LIFE?<br />
Also I&rsquo;m not conviced about the keyboard version without the physical back buttons and trackpad..<br />
And I can tell you.. If I&rsquo;m not conviced, alot of other people won&rsquo;t be&hellip;<br />
Loving the new OS tho.</p>
<p>I had the same feeling about the presentation</p>
<p>Yeah, the scripted &ldquo;conversations&rdquo; were so awkward.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say less awkward than MSFT&rsquo;s or Qualcomm&rsquo;s recently</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with you about the presentation, but most of what you are looking for in terms of Phone Specs are in Josh&rsquo;s review. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3929760/blackberry-z10-review">BlackBerry Z10 review: a new life, or life support?</a></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe they totally skipped over the voice recognition capabilities. There&rsquo;s a <a href="http://youtu.be/UK0hWJEr874">video</a> of a German fellow putting it head-to-head with Siri, and it actually preformed pretty well. Yet nothing in The Verge review or their own presentation.</p>
<p>BlackBerry left a bunch of features out of their presentation. But what were they going to do in an hour and a half. They couldn&rsquo;t fit everything it.</p>
<p>When are we getting started?</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re probably still checking out the Z10s on display at the events.</p>
<p>good call, I&rsquo;m curious to know if the soft-touch back is like that of the Nexus 7</p>
<p>Vlad: yada yada yada..</p>
<p>Thanks for that contribution.</p>
<p>where are they right now?</p>
<p>Will this video be released in the Vergecast podcast feed?</p>
<p>Advertise Advertise Advertise, you&rsquo;re on the right track RIM.</p>
<p>not really. If BB10 rocks, then they&rsquo;re on the right track. I hope i can get my Hands on one device soon (not buying one though)</p>
<p>If they have an awesome product that no one knows about, they will fail.  Having Super Bowl ads is being on the right track.</p>
<p>It could go either way.  If they put an ad in front of millions of people over a product that is sub par, they will just be demonstrating their incompetence to the vast majority of people. Remember Motorola and the Xoom Superbowl ad?  Imagine that ten fold if it goes wrong.</p>
<p>Well, if the build is not as solid as an iphone, the results are going to be mediocre at best, something like the lumias. If it is, then BB10 manufacturing plants will be blown with employees..</p>
<p>At this point, its got to be the hardware that can make or break&hellip; Hopefully not cheap plastic!</p>
<p>Agree with the timing and choosing to sponsor Superbowl</p>
<p>I have several dev alpha devices, we are building on BB10. I can tell you this, it kicks the snot out of my iPhone 4 and any Galaxy I have laid hands on. Better nav, better social integration, just better all around.</p>
<p>The alphas are rather plasticy and I thought that might bug me but so far it isn&rsquo;t a big deal and in fact, it makes it a bit more rugged it seems.</p>
<p>I think RIM is going to knock the cover off the ball on this next launch, the Superbowl ad is perfect for them.</p>
<p>I dunno man&hellip;what separates them from an android device? What would I gain from going BB10 compared to Android?  Their biggest selling feature seems to be that they can utilize android apps but if that&rsquo;s the case, why  not just get the real  deal and get an android. <br />
The OS looks just like BB or iOS to the average user&hellip;.sure it has some swipe functions but I don&rsquo;t see that as a differentiator at all.</p>
<p>One advert on the telly is not enough to move BB from 4th place anywhere close to android or iOS.  Canada they have a very good chance to get some sales but it&rsquo;s doubtful they will even get to 2nd in their home country.</p>
<p>Europe they are dead (outside of UK)&hellip;Africa and Indonesia is their best shot but these devices will be literally 3x too expensive for them</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to note that BB 10 isn&rsquo;t missing any major feature that&rsquo;s standard on Android or iOS.  IMO BlackBerry 10 &ndash; it&rsquo;s a genuine alternative, not a weak copy of IOS or Android although it will look familiar to Android, iOS, or WP8 users, but will feel very different to use. The integration of gestures, the speed, the active frames, the general flow between apps and services; it all appears to be well-thought out and intuitive to use. Security is top-notch, BBM features and NFC approved payments and much are to be unveiled on the 30th..stay tuned</p>
<p>Hate to break it to you, but the iPhone 4 is 2 and a half yrs old. I really don&rsquo;t think comparing it to that is helpful.</p>
<p>What would be different if he uses a 4S or 5? Other testers smoked the 5, the GS3 and the Lumia 920 with the Dev Alpha B.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it. You show up in each and every RIM article on The Verge and pray down the same things, which are completely based on gut instinct and nescience. And no, <strong>utilizing Android apps is not their biggest selling feature.</strong> The thing is that you just weren&rsquo;t able to recognize what seperates them from Android devices. But there&rsquo;s a guy above you who actually spent &ndash; in contrast to you &ndash;  hands-on time with it and who develops for it, who days that even those Dev Alpha beta units blow the competition out of the water. And it doesn&rsquo;t play a role wether we&rsquo;re talking about an iPhone 4, Nexuses or iPhone 5s or GS3s here, the Dev Alpha even with beta software also smokes the latter two according to guys who spent hands-on time with it.</p>
<p>There is a reason why all four major carriers are on board even though the devices haven&rsquo;t even launched yet.</p>
<p>Dude why are in every RIM thread defending everything about this company? It smokes iOS, Android and WP in what? Pushing emails? Loading apps? Browser tests? If this were 2008 I&rsquo;d say good on ya, but the processors today are no slouches, and as someone who sold phones in a major carriers retail store I can&rsquo;t imagine someone saying &ldquo;Wow, the new BB loaded that page 1.5 seconds faster than my current phone! Who do I make this check out to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, are the swipe gestures intuitive and/or obvious? I don&rsquo;t think displaying a video upon activation will do the trick. Most reps when turning on a phone skip past that crap anyway because they want to just test the phone out and send the customer on their way.</p>
<p>I mean, look at Android. One of its coolest features is the ability to download new home screens, which is as easy to do as installing an app but no regular people even realize you can do that.</p>
<p>Oh god, &ldquo;plasticy&rdquo;? I sure hope that plastic ends up feeling secure. I don&rsquo;t mind use of plastic in devices, as long as I forget it&rsquo;s made of plastic.</p>
<p>RIM should just partner with Sony already and release some gorgeous looking devices that run BB10. All I really want because aesthetically Sony is producing some of the best looking devices out in the market.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the partnership did happen, that way you could have a choice of hardware design, something the Android Ecosystem is able to play to their advantage. That being said though, I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re going to get a lot of replies disagreeing with your opinion that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;better-all-around&rsquo; when compared to competition. I&rsquo;d have to disagree too because no OS is better all around than another unless you specifically prefer the features it plays up.</p>
<p><img title="Blackberry Z10" src="http://cdn.tinhte.vn/attachments/834889/" alt="Blackberry Z10" /></p>
<p>Z10 chassis is made of metal (mostly steel)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/BlackBerry-Z10-and-BlackBerry-X10-parts-show-up-online_id38300#7-" target="_blank">http://www.phonearena.com/news/BlackBerry-Z10-and-BlackBerry-X10-parts-show-up-online_id38300#7-</a></p>
<p>Hardware looks nice&hellip;especially the white version I&rsquo;ve seen.<br />
However, those seem to be targeted towards android/iphone users which I can&rsquo;t see will make the switch in the immediate future.<br /><strong>Every</strong> single current BB user I have spoken with wants the physical keyboard version, which apparently will be delayed until the summer&hellip;makes no sense to me</p>
<p>Okay, you say you <strong>can&rsquo;t see</strong> them switching, I for me already <strong>heard</strong> folks who are actually going to switch.</p>
<p>Great. Thats anecdotal though. What we need is a poll from a non-tech source to get a more accurate reading.</p>
<p>As far as I know the keyboard version is still on track for a March release. Only one analyst guessed otherwise so far.</p>
<p>It also has to be a good advertisement.</p>
<p>Motorola had a Super Bowl commercial for the Xoom, and look how that turned out.</p>
<p>that is subjective, again the point is still you remember Xoom to date because of that. I still have got that Apple ad from 1984 in my mind&hellip;sometimes timing is the key to strike attention from the user</p>
<p>I knew what the Xoom was because I read about it at CES that year, not because of the Super Bowl ad. Most people were just confused at the SB party I went.</p>
<p>Yup. Worked for Samsung. Freaking commercials are everywhere.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one way to spend $4m. Also, a press release to advertise a commercial?!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, a press release to advertise a commercial?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, HTC has a phone for a phone, so why not?</p>
<p>Yo Dawg</p>
<p>Why haven&#8217;t we seen the preview of BB10 on the current PlayBook yet ? Is it even coming ?</p>
<p>RIM said its coming after launch.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what she said as well.</p>
<p>May unofficially</p>
<p>You can install BB10 from the Dev alpha devices on the playbook. But it&rsquo;ll look like a very large phone. Take that Galaxy Note III</p>
<p>Prepare to see a samsung galaxy ad each commercial break.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll probably play one in the corner during other adverts, too!</p>
<p>It would have been a huge missed opportunity if they didnt use the Superbowl to showcase BlackBerry 10. The reach is too large not to, ads usually go viral and are reported on like a separate event, they just better make sure they hire a great firm to do the ad!</p>
<p>Well I made a virtual checklist for RIM over a year ago&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire Lazaridis and Balsillie.</li>
	<li>Make a sexy touchscreen handset to compete with iPhone.</li>
	<li>Get apps&hellip; lots of them.</li>
	<li>Marketing Marketing Marketing!</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be damned if they aren&rsquo;t reading my mind.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re unveiling BB10 on my birthday, so that&rsquo;s more proof.</p>
<p>Wow how did you come up with that list. They must have read your mind, because this is an original idea right here.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s not that hard to be successful. Why doesn&rsquo;t EVERY company have the #1 spot on the smartphone charts?!</p>
<p>To be honest, the last one didn&rsquo;t get added until the GSIII came out and everyone forgot about the One X.</p>
<p>Z10 looks just like any Android phone out therethere. Not impressed.</p>
<p>Can you direct me to this sub 4.3 inch Android device with modern specs and a gesture based UI? All I&rsquo;ve been able to find is 4.5+ behemoths with outdated button based UI&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>You aren&rsquo;t looking very hard then&hellip;you can get Android on screens from the small to the large&hellip;they have custom UI&rsquo;s which will give you similar functionality but the standard UI is pretty good&hellip;</p>
<p>I agree with TheGreaterFool&hellip;it looks like nice hardware (BB10) and the OS is miles better than their existing platform but there is nothing really to swing the general populace from android or iOS</p>
<p>RIM is not planning to get 50%+ market share overnight, but this should stop people from leaving their platform, it should bring back some others who have left, it will pick up some who are on the fence, and it will definitely get some others who are unhappy with their current platforms.</p>
<p>Will get <strong>some</strong> who are currently on BB&hellip;I would imagine though they will wait for hardware keyboard units which will be released in the summer I think&hellip;<br />
Probably will not bring back many if they have bought into other ecosystems&hellip;RIM has no ecosystem so once you get into the google world or apple or MS it&rsquo;s hard to get them back&hellip;<br />
Their best bet is to release some low cost units for the only markets they are currently doing well, Indonesia and Africa&hellip;neither of the 2 leaked BB&rsquo;s coming out will be anywhere close to the cost required to succeed in those markets.</p>
<p>what ecosystem Microsoft has apart from Skydrive that would matter on phones? BB10 has all kinds of integration you can think &ndash; Movies(same as Google play from ROVI), Music from 7Digital(largest catalog of any online music store), dropbox(best cloud storage in the market period), Maps(tomtom), all I can say is it will launch with 200% more useful and known apps than WP8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Music from 7Digital(largest catalog of any online music store)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7digital is available on <a href="http://about.7digital.com/consumers/mobile/">all</a> platforms and has less tracks than xbox?</p>
<p>I am not debating 7Digital doesn&rsquo;t exist on other platforms but rather saying RIM has it&rsquo;s means cut out, 7Digital is just the official store. Blackberries had amazon mp3 since many years and the Blackberry OS 6 supports itunes Wifi sync even before Iphone had it. There are plethora of options such side loading of Android apps like Google maps, Google Drive,Youtube etc. even if Google choose not to create apps for BB10</p>
<p>What would compel the average user to side load? If those apps are important a user will buy an Android device.</p>
<p>Because a sideloaded android app will run better on BB10 than Android.<br />
Do some research into QNX to see how this is true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because a sideloaded android app will run better on BB10 than Android.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any evidence this is true or is it an assumption?</p>
<p>I seriously doubt Google will allow their official apps to be sideloaded on a different platform they haven&rsquo;t authorized.</p>
<p>200% more useful apps than WP8&hellip;really? With the exception of instagram and some big name iOS games, mostly everything is there for WP8.  The biggest issue with WP8 (and even Android believe it or not) is that smaller niche applications like a small local bank, your alarm system or lighting system is first written for iOS and then later written for other platforms&hellip;maybe&hellip;.<br />
All WP8 apps are native, not ports of Android apps&hellip;.again, if I wanted android apps I would get an android phone&hellip;there is nothing substantive for the average user in the BB10 OS&hellip;</p>
<p>Microsoft has a massive ecosystem&hellip;not sure why I am even commenting there&hellip;Xbox Music, Xbox Video, Office, Outlook online, messenger/Skype, integration with Windows 8, MS Exchange, Lync, Bing, Maps&hellip;.the list goes on and on&hellip;..</p>
<p>&ldquo;there is nothing substantive for the average user in the BB10 OS&rdquo;</p>
<p>You just <strong>do not know</strong> anything substantive BB10 OS has.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re simply an ignorant fool, sorry. Let&rsquo;s work out your list:</p>
<p>- Xbox Music<br />
As if everybody cares about XBox Music. The point here is music and there is 7Digital on the one hand, mass storage mode and sync-software on the other. Does 90% of the market that uses iOS or Android care about this?<br />
- Xbox Video<br />
As if everybody cares about Xbox Video. The pint here is Video and BB World on BB10 will have movies, videos and TV shows, mass storage mode and sync-software. Does 90% of the market that uses iOS or Android care about this?<br />
- Office<br />
DocumentsToGo. That&rsquo;s enough for all iOS and Android users out there so far and those two account for 90% of the entire market.<br />
- Outlook online<br />
No body cares. The native Messaging app is gorgeous and integrates with everything on the market.<br />
- messenger/Skype<br />
There will be Skype integration, that has leaked.<br />
- Integration with Windows 8<br />
The new BlackBerry desktop software &ldquo;BlackBerry Link&rdquo; will integrate with both Windows 8 and Mac OSX.<br />
- MS Exchange<br />
BB10 supports both Exchange ActiveSync and CalDav/CardDav.<br />
-Lync<br />
Wow, does anybody care?<br />
-Bing<br />
BB10 supports both Bing and Google as default search engine.<br />
-Maps<br />
Full integrated TomTom with turn-by-turn and voice control.</p>
<p>Anything else ????</p>
<p>Android apps run as native in QNX.<br />
on that note with a proper IOS server IOS apps will too.</p>
<p>The point is that if you buy movies or apps on Android, you can&rsquo;t watch  or use them on BB10 without having to pay again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;you can get Android on screens from the small to the large&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, but the smaller screen, the worse the specs. There is <strong>no</strong> Android phone out there who meets the Specs of the Z10 with a 4.2" 355PPI screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;they have custom UI&rsquo;s&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The average consumer couldn&rsquo;t care less about custom UIs who are just eyecandy most of the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;which will give you similar functionality&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good joke. Do your custom UIs spend Android a different Kernel or what? It&rsquo;s not just about <strong>having</strong> gestures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t looking very hard then&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then help me out. Where can I get this phone in North America. The closest thing I have been able to come up with is an Xperia V which isn&rsquo;t available here.</p>
<p>Rims doing a good job and will keep third place a lot of rim fans waiting for the bb 10 device.</p>
<p>I really hope so.  BB10 looks nice and I hope it is enough to keep RIM a player in the marketplace.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that rim will continue with the third os. Bb has a lot of mind share over customers. That&#8217;s why wp isn&#8217;t gaining any traction because people don&#8217;t associate good things with windows which why it would of been smart if Microsoft called it something else</p>
<p>The X phone?</p>
<p>Wait, you think regular people have a positive view of previous versions of Blackberry? If that&rsquo;s true then why do you think RIM had to start with a completely brand new OS?</p>
<p>Real question is: Is the Playbook still on track to get the BB10 update? I have been holding to that tablet simply in anticipation of testing BB10.</p>
<p>yep, have had already multiple confirmations from RIM higher ups..may be sometime after the complete launch(April or May)</p>
<p>I got told CURRENT timetable is May</p>
<p>A phone and a tablet?</p>
<p>Playbook did not work. Why this one would?</p>
<p>Because the phones when the tablet launched were not BB10</p>
<p>Picked up the playbook again after buying it during the firesale last year and updated to the latest firmware.  I have to say I&rsquo;m enjoying the heck out of this little thing, granted it&rsquo;s a bit slower that you&rsquo;re average smartphone nowadays but thanks to the wonderful OS it runs fairly speedily.  After using iOS and android for so long, you become accustomed to thinking those are the two best OSes for mobile but there are features in the ONX that I wish were in android/iOS.  The beautiful swiping gestures, the way multiple applications are displayed, even the font used is beautiful.  The rendering of text on a low resolution display actually makes some 720p look like SD.</p>
<p>If they can get their App store upto speed and make it much easier to get Android apps on there.  I would seriously consider acquiring the next BB10 tablet.</p>
<p>I personally believe that was all thats missing from the PlayBook, apps and BlackBerry 10 improves on the OS as well as closes the app gap with Frank Boulben promising 90% of the top 600 iOS and Android apps for EACH region being available.</p>
<p>ughh no.</p>
<p>RIM definitely needs to advertise, but pissing money away on Super Bowl spots for tech crap isn&#8217;t the ticket.</p>
<p>look at Motorola&#8217;s mistake trying to unseat the iPad with that terrible xoom ad buy, look how much money Microsoft has pissed away with the nfl broadcasting dollars.</p>
<p>the Super Bowl is a great event to watch and a great way to advertise beer, fast food and cars but its not the right platform to launch an obscure fourth mobile platform.</p>
<p>they should take the money and buy 10x as many prime time spots plus a huge online campaign &#8211; and maybe pay for some product placement..</p>
<p>They should be advertising &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; commercials now seeing as we are only a few days away&hellip;pretty disappointed I have not seen one advertisement for BB10 here in Canada outside of the mobile companies offering pre-orders (Bell, Telus, etc&hellip;)</p>
<p><strong>WHY should they do that?</strong></p>
<p>To piss off people by promoting a product they have to wait and wait and wait for?</p>
<p>They will hold a big launch event in 6 cities around the globe simultaneously, followed by a superbowl ad and a broad marketing campaign, when the product will actually be available. That&rsquo;s the only right way to do this.</p>
<p>Umm because it makes people curious and builds hype? I believe the original Droid campaign did the same thing, and many attribute that ad campaign to the takeoff of Android.</p>
<p>Also, we&rsquo;re talking a week or so, not six months of waiting. Relax yourself.</p>
<p>Actually, they should do both &ndash; as long as the Superbowl ad is truly memorable, that is.  It really needs to be a knockout, otherwise they have indeed wasted a nice stack of money.</p>
<p>If 0.1% of the superbowl audience who sees the spot will end up buying a Z10, they have an estimated ROI on that ad of 300%. Not including the excitement and word those people might spread around them as they have the phone.</p>
<p>OMG, so RIM places a superbowl ad and your conclusion is that they chose the superbowl to launch a new platform as their only marketing approach. C&rsquo;mon, man. Of course that superbowl ad will only be <strong>one part</strong> of a much bigger campaign. It&rsquo;s about mindshare and the superbowl has a reach of 111 million people. There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with spending 3 to 4 million bucks on showing 111 million people your new product.</p>
<p>Xoom &ndash; what a bad comparison. The Xoom didn&rsquo;t fail because of that superbowl ad, but because it was a shitty product. It was a highly expensive gadget with absolutely no tablet-ecosystem aiming at the iPad-market. I say &ldquo;iPad-market&rdquo; here, because there was no tablet market at that time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Internet Bubble days all over again with massive spending on an advertisement seen by partly-drunk football fans!</p>
<p>Insightful comments from readers&hellip; am I in heaven?</p>
<p>No matter what they do or show me, it won&rsquo;t be enough to pull me away from my Galaxy Note 2&hellip;sorry BB.</p>
<p>Cool story bro.</p>
<p>It really is a cool I&rsquo;m not buying a BB10 no matter what story&hellip;a true story.</p>
<p>Yup. You&rsquo;re the type of person RIM does not care to advertise to. You have already made up your mind based on reasons that have nothing to do with the quality of the phone. It is to your own detriment to ignore alternatives, but that is fine with you.</p>
<p>Remember those Samsung ads that made iPhone users waiting in line look like idiots? Remember how everyone was like &ldquo;How is Sammy going to convert iPhone users if they insult them??&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well it turns out Samsung wasn&rsquo;t focusing the ad on iPhone users. It was focused on people <strong>considering</strong> an iPhone. Samsung realized that some people&mdash;like you&mdash;are so bought into their particular platform that it wouldn&rsquo;t matter if their phones printed money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not buying a BB10 no matter what story&rdquo;</p>
<p>These people (like you) would never ever buy a non-Apple phone. These people (like you) would never try a Samsung for more than a second (and then&mdash;only to say &ldquo;it sucks&rdquo;), they would never compare feautures, they would never do any <strong>honest</strong> research of the product.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, there is no point in caring about people like you who don&rsquo;t make product purchases based on the true merits of a product. You can&rsquo;t convince these people:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not buying a BB10 no matter what story&rdquo;</p>
<p>See?</p>
<p>First of all, I have never nor do I  know of anyone who went out and purchased a product do to a Superbowl ad, whether it Doritos or car&hellip;its all just good entertainment.  2nd, I currently own a Samsung Galxy Note 2 and perviously owned htc, palm and Windows mobile and I have never owned any Apple products&hellip;ever&hellip;not one.  The chances of me owning and BB 10 is the same as a Wp, slim to none.</p>
<p>OMG&hellip;. Wow. I didn&rsquo;t say you owned an iPhone. I said you were LIKE the Apple-only people in that you have made up your mind NOT to buy another product (in this <strong>example</strong>: a Samsung phone) with no care for what the possible merits of that product are.</p>
<p>You are literally <strong>blindly</strong> ruling out a product without having any real knowledge of that product. But its actually even worse than that&mdash;you <strong>actively</strong> <strong>refuse</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>know</strong> <strong>anything</strong> about the product you are refusing to purchase.</p>
<p>You are like someone who needs to buy a new TV but refuses to ever look at LG televisions. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to you if LG may be the best choice. You don&rsquo;t care&mdash;and worse than that&mdash;you will never even know if LG had the better TV because you have decided to <strong>actively</strong> hide from any information about LG TVs.</p>
<p>Most people would look at ALL TVs in their price range and decide amongst them which is the best fit for their needs. Most people don&rsquo;t refuse to consider Samsung TVs, or refuse to consider Sony TVs, because they value themselves and want to get the best product for their money.</p>
<p>And before you say &ldquo;Wait&hellip; I OWN an LG TV!!&rdquo;, let me say that&mdash;again&mdash;this is just an example.</p>
<p>If I had an unlimited bank account I&rsquo;d pick one up but there is no way I&rsquo;d switch from windows phone for BB10&hellip;I&rsquo;d probably go back to iOS or android first&hellip;I really would like to use one for a few weeks though as that&rsquo;s the only way you know if you will like the platform or not</p>
<p>I say you should stick with your WP and be happy with it.  Why take the chance of using the BB10 for a few weeks to find out if you will like it or not?  What if it turns out you really really like it.  Wouldn&rsquo;t you just kick yourself since &ldquo;there is no way&rdquo; you&rsquo;de switch to BB10?</p>
<p>Samsung spent $12 billion on advertising last year (6 times more than Microsoft, 12 times more than Apple), and look what happened.  A single Superbowl add is small potatoes, by comparison.</p>
<p>But there are still BB users out there, and ex-BB users who might miss the notification light, unified message center, etc.  RIM has got to get the word out and get those users excited about the new platform.</p>
<p>where did you see $12 billion from??? source please</p>
<p><a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/29/samsung-galaxy-apple-marketing/" target="_blank">http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/11/29/samsung-galaxy-apple-marketing/</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been covered all over the place.  They spent almost $4 billion during the Olympics, were at $9 billion during their last quarterly results, and are expected to reach $12 billion for the year.  That&rsquo;s why you see Galaxy S3 <strong>everywhere</strong>. I think I saw some Galaxy s3 branded toilet paper the other day.</p>
<p>And it works.  I know a number of people who got one this year for no rational reason whatsoever.  I don&rsquo;t think it affects Apple or Microsoft/Nokia very much, but they&rsquo;ve done a tremendous amount of damage to the other Android manufacturers.</p>
<p>Oh, thanks for the source.. but if you really look through it says samsung spends &ldquo;12 billion dollars on marketing&rdquo; so its not just their phones but probably their entire product range. The author was being misleading with his title and wordings.It would be ridiculous to think that they just amount that much on phone marketing spend only.</p>
<p>From the original article (<a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/11/29/the-cost-of-selling-galaxies/)" target="_blank">http://www.asymco.com/2012/11/29/the-cost-of-selling-galaxies/)</a> : Considering that their other divisions don&rsquo;t require as much &ldquo;marketing expense&rdquo; (semiconductors, LCD certainly, and TVs and Appliances to a lesser degree due to a smaller sales growth) we can imagine that the vast majority of this promotional spending has been in support of their mobile brands, Galaxy in particular.</p>
<p>The key word  being &ldquo;IMAGINE&rdquo;, so yeah, the $12 billions is not a fact, its a speculation. :)</p>
<p>RIM is definitely not playing around with the release of their new mobile OS. This is great to see since they&rsquo;re on the brink of death. From what I&rsquo;ve seen so far of the leaked phone and it&rsquo;s accompanying OS their off to a great start. Only the marketing is left to get this into the hands of the public.</p>
<p>Actually, they have 2 billion in the bank with no debt. So not dead, but they&rsquo;re not as relevant as they used to be.</p>
<p>They actually have 2.9 billion now.</p>
<p>Having more hope for this than Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Agree. They&#8217;re waiting for a healthy ecosystem.</p>
<p>Depends if they can market the OS to users. Long term development will require BlackBerry to actually sell&#8230;</p>
<p>Well I for one will be buying one.</p>
<p>Me too!</p>
<p>Me three, leave Iphone 5</p>
<blockquote>They’re waiting for a healthy ecosystem.</blockquote> <p>I thought they were waiting for the OS.</p>
<p>For once ever since Mr. Gates left, they&#8217;re making the right decision. Now, Windows Phone supports native code. A big thing for developers who now no longer have to rely on Silverlight. Also, keep  in mind that Windows Phone 8 is very much like toned down desktop operating system so, lots of power is available. We cannot say if BB10 will become a hit at this stage. It has lots of competition especially when Windows Phone is on a rise. Also, Microsoft has an ecosystem which is unused by many users. But, there are users who take full advantage. <br />
P.S. I am largely  a fan of android, Windows on PC and Mac. But, I am observant watcher and analyst of other OSes although I don&#8217;t have any certification.</p>
<p>How did 3rd parties code apps for Windows Mobile? Somehow, I don&#8217;t imagine Silverlight being implemented there.</p>
<p>windows ce is very much like a real desktop operating system.</p>
<p>bb10 is much like &#8220;real&#8221; os too, more so than wp8.<br />
(anyhow how can you be a fan of everything? if you love all they&#8217;re all on the same level)</p>
<p>wp8 runs the windows nt kernel which is also in the desktop windows version. Don&#8217;t tell me QNX is a real os more than windows!</p>
<p>so? it&#8217;s a flavor of the kernel, but you got no access. qnx is a real desktop os too and you actually have more access to it in bb10. for most anyone it&#8217;s totally irrelevant that wp8 runs nt based kernel.</p>
<p><a href="http://osdp.bplaced.net/en/screen_gallery.php?bsgfx=os/qnx_demo-scr-04.jpg">qnx desktop screenshot</a></p>

<p>I know that QNX is a realtime based operating system. It&#8217;s used in car systems and others. Regarding how much access you can have is irrelevant, because as you mentioned the phone gui will hide it anyway for consumers!</p>
<p>So then what&#8217;s your point?</p>
<p>WP8 running the NT based kernel is relevant to developers &#8211; and isn&#8217;t that the point?</p>
<p>So.. I don&#8217;t see why QNX won&#8217;t be able to support QT&#8230; that would be awesome.</p>
<p>So.. I don&#8217;t see why QNX won&#8217;t be able to support QT&#8230; that would be awesome.QNX reminds of EKA2 (aka Symbian) &#8230; very nice.</p>
<p>QNX does support QT. Well I can say for sure the Cascades NDK incorporates it :]</p>
<p><a href="http://blackberry.github.com/Cascades-Samples/" target="_blank">http://blackberry.github.com/Cascades-Samples/</a></p>
<p>Qt is supported on BB10, it&#8217;s actually a core part of the system and all of RIM&#8217;s native apps are built with it. They took QtCore and built their own GUI framework Cascades on top of it rather than using QtGui. QtGui is still available though and bundled with the device for devs that are porting apps over.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re building new Cascades is nicer, all the rendering is automatically done in a separate higher priority thread. Everything is automatically animated, and it&#8217;s pretty much impossible to make it not run at a perfect 60fps. It is still less mature though, and with that has a few more bugs than QtGui, but I haven&#8217;t run into anything significant while using it.</p>
<p>The real issue for developers is access for low level c programing. BB10 is fully POSIX compliant which makes it easier to port most backend platforms and libraries. This gives BB10 a significant advantage over Windows Phone (and to some extent Android).</p>
<p>The other major phone OSes too are very much like real desktop operating systems at their core, with unneeded functionality disabled (iOS, Android).  It&#8217;s pretty much the standard.</p>
<p>Silverlight is used for the GUI, while c# was used for the application istelf.  I may be wrong on this but I think the GUI is still Silverlight but now you can write apps in c/c++/c# which makes it much easier to port desktop applications (they still have to compile for a different architecture though, so it won&#8217;t always be that easy).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rebrand of silverlight (for the time being, it should be updated to be more in line with the implementation on Windows 8 in the future) called XAML, though this is not strictly necessary.</p>
<p>XAML supplies the programmer with simple templates and a framework to make &#8216;consistent&#8217; apps. Those that are styled and function in the way the OS does (metro). You can choose to completely bypass XAML and use an alternative or nothing at all, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Most games, for instance, will remove XAML as it&#8217;s not really helpful.</p>
<p>XAML is NOT a re-brand of Silverlight. Silverlight was originally WPF/Everywhere, intended explicitly as a web-based plugin that was a subset of WPF, nothing more. Since its inception of course it has celebrated success and growth in areas that WPF proper did not, and so naturally some of these enhancements have made their way back into the WPF stack. But, XAML is not SL, Windows Store apps are not SL, etc. Technically, it&#8217;s mostly a matter of compilation targets and project types. At the core of your application, you have XAML view files, and .NET codebehind/classes. Whether or not these are part of a SL project or Desktop or Store application is mostly all that is important to the compiled end result. There are some differences in the core CLR between these application types, but by and large most functionality is common between them. Moreover, you cannot make a SL application run on RT, but you should be able to port it rather easily to an RT app using mostly all of the same code.</p>
<p>No. We&#8217;re talking about Windows Phone here. Windows Phone doesn&#8217;t use a proper XAML stack yet, it still uses that of silverlight as to provide backwards compatibility with Windows Phone 7.X applications.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also why the promised &#8220;code once, run everywhere&#8221; ideal isn&#8217;t really in full swing yet. There are still some inconsistencies between Windows 8 / RT and Windwos Phone 8, even at the most basic coding level. There are ways of making a truly portable application, but they involve completely dropping XAML (just making a pure C++/CX DirectX game for instance) and restricting yourself to the cross platform WinRT API functionality.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t saying XAML == silverlight per se. It would be better if I had said that Windows Phone 8 doesn&#8217;t technically have XAML at all yet, even if it says it does.</p>
<p>Right, I agree with you mostly just wanted to point out that RT/Start screen apps are not SL (just a co-evolving subset of WPF).</p>
<p>You can still use XAML in a portable application &#8211; just like you can create a  control that utilizes XAML and use it in a WPF or SL application &#8211; but obviously you can&#8217;t use functionality that they do not share, which could be a problem depending on the implementation.</p>
<p>A Rectangle is to a Square as WPF is to SL (notwithstanding the separate evolution therein). Similarly, WP8 does certainly have XAML, even though that&#8217;s a strange way of saying it .. more appropriately it supports applications that use  XAML markup.</p>
<p>Writing truly portable apps is more an exercise in architecture &#8211; specifically IOC (interface dependence in general) &#8211; than limitations of the current quasi-unified architecture. It does add some overhead, for sure: if there are inconsistencies between RT/WP, then abstracting the different functionality into common interfaces across platform-specific assemblies to allow your consuming code to be shared across platforms can be a headache .. but it&#8217;s certainly not impossible.</p>
<p>giving 100$ per ap doesn&#8217;t make it healthy</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8230; bribery!</p>
<p>Yeah, but it&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>Does $100 pay for futue app updates and email support by the orignal devs?</p>
<p>It could if there is a good adoption rate, but without any apps its be a much harder sell. In the long run I think its smart to do whatever you can for apps.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 could be in big trouble. I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how this plays itself out in the upcoming months.</p>
<p>Windows Phone doesn&#8217;t have to pay people to make apps.</p>
<p>Actually&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/nokia-microsoft-appcampus-2m/" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/nokia-microsoft-appcampus-2m/</a></p>
<p>fairly different scale though.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t really matter how they get it done if they get the results eventually.</p>
<p>Yes and no. If developers are just doing it for the quick cash back, they won&#8217;t be interesting in maintaining their app on the minority platform like WP8 or BB10. Simply put the quality won&#8217;t be there.</p>
<p>I agree! Just submitting an app is the first step! Then the other problem is maintaining future development for updates and features! This costs developer money and time! Furthermore, devs also won&#8217;t like to waste time on email support for such a minority platform!</p>
<p>Frank Boulben, the CMO at RIM, told Fierce Wireless in an interview last week or the week before that they will have 90% of the top 600 iOS and Android applications.</p>
<p>They will face the same problem that windows phone has if they can make it even to windows phone&#8217;s place&#8230;<br />
The problem is not getting the big apps (although RIM will have a problem there as well)&#8230;the problem is getting someone&#8217;s local bank to make an app&#8230;.an app for their security system&#8230;for the company they work for&#8230;etc&#8230;</p>
<p>If anyone can make it work its MS&#8230;RIM will have a massively difficult problem getting apps and also the fact that they have no ecosystem to speak of (no music, video, no Xbox, no macOS, no youtube, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>smh LOL, assuming makes you look real stupid you know. Where did you get the idea RIM didn&#8217;t have music or video? They renamed appworld to Blackberry World because they will have all of that, youtube will be there, BB10 doesn&#8217;t need Xbox not everyone owns and Xbox and im sure people aren&#8217;t buying their windows phone just based off their Xbox, it has been out for over 2years and yet to make a dent but kept the same UI for its newest version smh. How do you know RIM will have a problem getting the big apps? They also don&#8217;t need a macOS their phones connect to all desktop OS</p>
<p>From the looks of it, you&#8217;re responding to an entirely different comment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always been an app issue. Apple has the same problem.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be so embroiled in the platform wars that Apple started .. but what happens after that?</p>
<p>Equilibrium will be found eventually, and that won&#8217;t leave just a single platform, and it probably won&#8217;t be just 2. It&#8217;s a tenuous battle for the consumers though: better choice, or better functionality.</p>
<p>That said, every platform vendor is competing to do the same thing, just differently. That&#8217;s A LOT of aggregate overhead that ultimately a customer is paying for (for evidence of this, see Apple&#8217;s mountain of cash).</p>
<p>Remember the issues of cross-platform applications? Remember how FLASH was EPIC because you could write it once, and it would simply work everywhere? If you bought into Apple&#8217;s temporal argument about battery life, you DON&#8217;T get the prize. Defeating FLASH for mobile devices was a move to ensure they started the platform wars and benefited from them.</p>
<p>Right now we&#8217;ve got the dominant 2 phone platforms .. and it&#8217;s bringing to light the issue of platforms squashing competition. You see things like &#8220;I would love to switch to a better platform, but I can&#8217;t bring any of my functionality with me.&#8221;. You see app vendors who have ample resources to make their apps available cross-platform, but don&#8217;t, because they can&#8217;t envision enough demand because of the self-negating pressure the platform wars put on competition, and consumer demand for it and the target audience.</p>
<p>(FWIW, that demand/target audience issue is probably the #1 reason why Win8 doesn&#8217;t have a traditional Start Menu and why the new Start Screen is such a big deal. Having a 95%+ unified platform across desktop/tablet/phone means a phone app vendor effectively can count the billions of desktops as their target audience with just a minor platform targeting effort. And on the flipside, it means desktop app vendors will be able to target a mobile audience without having to learn a new technology stack.)</p>
<p>So .. back to the question .. what happens when the market reaches equilibrium? What happens when we&#8217;ve wasted countless hours, and years re-inventing the wheel for every new functionally-equivalent-but-different vehicle? I think in the coming years we&#8217;ll see either the big 3+1 take a leap into native cross-platform support for eachother&#8217;s platforms, or a new disruptive platform will emerge that takes it on.</p>
<p>A lot of folks have hoped that HTML5 would be that disruptive player .. and to some extent is has. But ultimately it&#8217;s a second-class citizen to native code, and has yet to give rise to truly disruptive changes to the way the platform wars are being fought, at the peril of the consumer.</p>
<p>In other words: Why shouldn&#8217;t I be able to run an iOS app on my Android/WP, or vice versa?</p>
<p>THAT is the future we should all get behind, not the one that fosters the growth of monolithic silos. THAT is the future where everyone wins, and consumers don&#8217;t have to sacrifice choice.</p>
<p>True that.  Getting the 100 cash back doesn&#8217;t act as a disincentive for future support though.  100 dedicated developers + 1000 rubbish ones are no worse than than 100 dedicated developers alone.</p>
<p>They could have a million crappy apps written in a weekend, but it won&#8217;t matter if they don&#8217;t have the big names.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always liked RIM, but just speaking with people about BB&#8217;s, they just don&#8217;t seem to be interested anymore. I don&#8217;t know how RIM is going to change the public perception.</p>
<p>Its called marketing, they have 2.9Bn in cash, with about 1bn of it that they are planning to spend on marketing the device. Nice timing for a Superbowl advert me thinks</p>
<p>Microsoft is spending more money on advertising WP8 than BB has in total but it&#8217;s no guarantee.<br />
The only positive I can see is that third world countries seem to be very much into BB</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just not true, the original reports were of a $1.8Bn Windows 8 marketing budget. It&#8217;s since been pegged at about $1Bn total. That&#8217;s for all of Windows 8 + WP8. RIM will toss nearly that much behind only two devices that already have a greater mindshare.</p>
<p>Do you have a link for that? I tried looking for reports of their marketing budgets but got nothing</p>
<p>And where did you read that they are going to spend every last dime they have on hand on marketing?</p>
<p>Yes, actually they do.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. Blackberry will be the only manufacturer of its phones. At least with windows phones you have uniquely designed phones.</p>
<p>and you don&#8217;t think blackberry phones are unique? they have sliders, all touch, candy bar, flip phones all styled in that blackberry way.</p>
<p>Unless of course you&#8217;re not  a fan especially of the qwerty keyboard which many manufacturers/platforms have abandon on mobile devices.</p>
<p>You do have a point that there&#8217;s more manufacturers but unique in subtle ways perhaps but generally the same all touch phone. and nothing stopping samsung or htc from releasing similar phones on other platforms.</p>
<p>Um no I don&#8217;t think they are. While you have different form factors (which is great) they still come in the boring black and white colors like its still 2011. Color is the new trend as demonstrated by the new Lumias, 8Xs and GS3s.</p>
<p>Its time for RIM to have at least one line that looks hip and sheds the tight ass suit and tie design theme they have for their slab phones.</p>
<p>See in the customer&#8217;s mind they might still have memories of their atrocious older BlackBerrys, unstable software, random reboots, ugly hardware, convoluted settings pages, confusing Blackberry pins, etc so when they see the new revamped Blackberrys  in stores, a black or white slab sitting next to colorful Lumias with its colorful and &#8220;alive&#8221; interface which one do you think they&#8217;ll be attracted to?</p>
<p>you mean iOS and android are not trouble enough for windows phone?  Reminder.. even with iOS and android competition  they had 300% increase in sales during the holidays. Its not as big as iOS but it getting better. What exactly is Blackberry 10 bringing to the market?</p>
<p>right? I always think it&#8217;s funny how people will argue with percentages AND raw numbers at the same time as if it&#8217;s nbd, just as long as whatever the figure is it reaffirms their confirmation bias.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, organizing events like this seems like a desperate measure.</p>
<p>The more apps you submit the more money we pay you? WTF? The BB 10 App World is gonna be LOADED with crapware and fart apps this way.</p>
<p>I wish these guys would start valuing quality over quantity, in stead of this OMG MY APP STOR HAZ MOAR APPS THAN YOURZ bullsh*t.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an approval process. Obviously not all of these apps will get approved.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind Android apps can be ported to BB10</p>
<p>there&#8217;s an approval process for the iOS app store too, but that doesn&#8217;t stop there being 10,000s of crapware apps there to inflate the app numbers.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s already loaded with couple of devs who just repackage other peoples android apps into bb apps.</p>
<p>just noticed our app there.. which is fine I suppose since it&#8217;s a free download but kinda strange.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that too. Additionally, devs have also noticed their pay apps turning up on in BB App world. <br />
$100 to steal and port an app seems like a good deal. Selling the app is just an added bonus.</p>
<p>if that&#8217;s the case, I can see a lot of brutal lawsuits showing up fairly soon. Either at the repackers or at RIM itself for facilitating that to happen.</p>
<p>In that case&#8230;. Or Google for facilitating it as well since they make it so easy.</p>
<p>No google does provide code signing protect in the dev tools. Not all devs use it properly!</p>
<p>Nah, google doesn&#8217;t have a duty of care in this case. Plus there&#8217;s no causal nexus between what google does and what the pirates do.</p>
<p>I could see a lot of those devs successfully going against RIM for potential los of profits, loss of good brand name and a few others things, with RIM being the facilitator for such.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason why MS adds a big disclaimer in their store to not use copyrighted names in app submissions when you don&#8217;t own the copyright or name.</p>
<p>This is a lot worse.</p>
<p>Most ported android app might not even work properly or interface correctly with the rest of the os. Can also hurt the app&#8217;s brand too!</p>
<p>that&#8217;s what I meant with the loss of good brand name actually :P</p>
<p>Not to mention &#8211; no updates, no support and a slew of other things which will taint the apps name as well.</p>
<p>I agree your&#8217;s is a free app, but what about android developers who actually charge for their apps? Who earns the money if some pirate is porting your app to the bb10 app market? What if the pirate is posting the app for free to buy?</p>
<p>If somebody puts your app on the BB app market it is really simply to have it taken down. All you need to do is file a complaint and provide proof that it is your app and they will take it down. Easy as that.</p>
<p>Then hopefully it can work!</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve realized they need quality, that&#8217;s why they created the Built for BlackBerry program and the $10k guarantee. But ultimately they need volume too for marketing purposes, and that&#8217;s what events like this are for. If 1 in 100 apps are of high quality then it&#8217;s money well spent. It&#8217;s also about those small simple apps that have demand. A currency exchange rate app isn&#8217;t going to win any awards, but it has demand.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s have a bet then, shall we?</p>
<p>:]</p>
<p>Yeah, but I&#8217;m not so sure. Depends on the devices, price points and the loyalty of existing Blackberry users. Quite surprised to see a friend on Twitter say he was dumping his iPhone for a new Blackberry. The apps I&#8217;ve seen seem to follow iOS and Android in terms of layout and UX so it won&#8217;t be as difficult as having to port and redesign the app like you would have to for Windows Phones.</p>
<p>Microsoft really shit the bed with games on Windows Phone though. Adding in the ability to access and play some of the Indie/XBL games like Shadow Complex on the phone would have been huge.</p>
<p>Why is that? They both are really great os&#8217;s. The Lumina phones have brought back Nokia positive sells.</p>
<p>All this time I thought the Lumina was a crap Chevrolet car from the 90&#8217;s</p>
<p>It&#8217;s &#8220;Lumia&#8221;.<br />
No &#8216;n&#8217;</p>
<p>Quantity != quality. When will people ever learn?</p>
<p>You talking bout Android?</p>
<p>No, every platform.</p>
<p>The blackberry user base is there,  with cheaper hardware and BES its still the best option for business.  It going to have apps and a fast browser so hopefully it will have what it takes to penetrate the conser market.  How well is WP8 doing anyway?</p>
<p>BES used to be best for business, we will see if it still holds true for BB10.  It very well could, but one thing to keep in mind is that RIM has ditched their push technology and is actually using ActiveSync from end to end.   I love ActiveSync and all, but it wasn&#8217;t as good as RIM&#8217;s push, IMO.</p>
<p>Not entirely. Enterprises can still use BES, BES 10 in particular. ActiveSync as well as CalDav and CardDav affect the consumer market in the first place.</p>
<p>Cool but the question is will they want to pay that? We&#8217;ll find out.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope this one doesn&#8217;t require you to restart and insert a CD to fix it.</p>
<p>no chance</p>
<p>Nobody knows what Blackberry is outside of America.</p>
<p>Are you sh*tting me? BBs main market have been asia lately where they are still popular!</p>
<p>True. But it&#8217;s the low end. That may not exactly translate into direct sales.</p>
<p>BlackBerry is actually extremely popular in the UK still. The place it has less relevance is in emerging and third world countries, where android and windows phone are battling it out.</p>
<p>Personally I see BB10 being equally relevant as WP8 for the time being, but simply not having the world coverage that any of the other platforms offer. The cheapest android and windows phone devices are surprisingly capable and very price competitive.</p>
<p>You are pretty ass backwards&#8230;.no offense.<br />
BB is extremely popular in emerging markets and the third world like Indonesia and Africa&#8230;they are dead in the water in Europe&#8230;I think the UK is the only place in Europe where BB ever took off&#8230;</p>
<p>I think RIM will do well in Canada and will move units in the US if they get big carrier support but I don&#8217;t think they will make enough to survive&#8230;they will survive based on third world business believe it or not</p>
<p>I think you need to recheck your data. Blackberry popularity has dropped into a void in emerging markets, android being the monster that it is.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re seeing the cheap windows phone and androids taking a decent chunk of countries like India and China with the only other real competitor being homegrown brands (huawei and ZTE for instance).</p>
<p>Blackberry has just recently dipped below Windows Phone in terms of global marketshare. Considering that&#8217;s a platform struggling to find any air to breathe right now, it&#8217;s obvious that RIM is losing its ground in the few places it remains.</p>
<p>Whether this trend will continue with the release of BB10 is yet to be seen. Really it all depends on how well they can scale their hardware and prices, as well as how quickly they can get into deals with the more interesting carriers (like the recent deal with Nokia and China Mobile for instance).</p>
<p>Have you ever been to those emerging markets? Most of them still use old Nokia dumbphones and only want iPhones and Samsung&#8217;s, and to an extent, Nokia&#8217;s new Windows Phone due to market presence! I was just in Vietnam, China, Japan and Thailand and guess what? iPhones, iPhones, iPhones. Vietnam and Thailand didn&#8217;t even have Apple stores, only resellers but there were slippers and clothes with the iPhone or Apple brand. People don&#8217;t care about Blackberry and they shot themselves in the foot by not providing anything during the emergence of iOS and Android. Nokia will still be making more than BB just off of their old symbian devices and that&#8217;s just sad.</p>
<p>Well, way to straight up lie. What about their 70% marketshare in markets like South Africa, other African nations, Latin American Nations, and Indochinese markets. It&#8217;s North America where they have trouble getting adoption&#8230;</p>
<p>BlackBerry currently has 69 Million active users. There are 6 billion mobile phones including 1 billion smartphones. That is not a good overall marketshare.</p>
<p>79million monthly paid subscribers to be exact</p>
<p>install base&#8230; market share would be how many sold in a quarter.  Of course that is probably an even worse statistic right now.</p>
<p>Lets not forget their advertising in all of those regions. Nokia and Samsung have that locked down in India, Indochina and Thailand. Same for Japan.</p>
<p>That is irrelevant if you read what I replied to: &#8220;Nobody knows what Blackberry is outside of America.&#8221; Obviously if they have that much marketshare in this places people <strong>outside of America</strong> knows what <strong>Blackberry is</strong>. I never said they have great marketshare. Right now they don&#8217;t. However, what they have shown so far is at least promising; they at least have a chance at this. The probability of success is what is up for debate. I choose to think that they have as reasonable chance as Windows Phone which is a start&#8230;</p>
<p>I welcome all new OSs to the market, but since BB never had any real user base or marketshare outside of North-America I wouldn&#8217;t have any high hopes for any significant marketshare now either.</p>
<p>People really need to do some research before they spout BS like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/01/02/blackberry-10-rim-asia-market-share_n_2394597.html" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/01/02/blackberry-10-rim-asia-market-share_n_2394597.html</a></p>
<p>BlackBerry currently has 69 Million active users. 60 Million of those users are not in the US of A</p>
<p>69million out of 6 billion mobile phones or 1 billion smartphones is not what I call a good marketshare.</p>
<p>Holding on to 79 million users, throughout 2012 when your last phone was released in 2011, is actually a lot, radically selling more then wo7/7.5/8 with old tech/os. Bb10 will bring new numbers to rim, your argument is invalid because your trying to compare there old OS/user base with products that were out months ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user switching to bb10</p>
<p>Will the low end sales in mist of these developing countries translate with BB10? I didn&#8217;t see them announce any low end phones..</p>
<p>You keep going back to this. <strong>Global marketshare isn&#8217;t what we are talking about</strong>. You said they never gained traction outside of the US, correct? <strong>He gave a link to an article disproving this notion.</strong> Now you switch the subject? Your wasting everybody&#8217;s time&#8230;</p>
<p>My point wasn&rsquo;t to claim that BB never had good market share in ANY country outside the N-America, but that globally where it didn&rsquo;t have good market share(which is most of the world) it won&rsquo;t have a good one in the near future either. I just didn&rsquo;t think it was necessary to list all markets that it did well.</p>
<p>My original point put simpler: OK marketshare in few places in the past &mdash;&gt; probably will do quite OK in them. But Low Global in the past &mdash;&gt; hard to gain high global in the near future. But still good luck to them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;BB never had any real user base or marketshare outside of North-America&rdquo;</p>
<p>You weren&rsquo;t talking about global marketshare, you mentioned a specific region. So, logically, you can expect people to mention regions and places whet, outside of North America, Blackberry has or did gain traction in.</p>
<p>What you meant and what you said are clearly different.</p>
<p>Really? WP is having some issues, but I hardly think it&#8217;s worse off than BB</p>
<p>WP has Nokia to piggyback off and also has a truckload of Microsoft money to keep this going for a decade or more if they choose&#8230;RIM is not so cash rich&#8230;</p>
<p>RIM has no ecosystem, a poor history of developer support, dwindling marketshare in Europe and North America</p>
<p>&#8220;RIM is not so cash rich&#8221;</p>
<p>Does RIM have to be as cash rich as MS to gain marketshare? They have a goal, a strategy, a well-positioned product and 2.9 billion of cash in the bank (and likely rising) to execute.</p>
<p>&#8220;RIM has no ecosystem&#8221;</p>
<p>BlackBerry World on BB10 will contain music, TV shows, movies, apps and games, all tied to your BB-ID. Evernote is baked in, there will be apps for Dropbox, BOX and SkyDrive. Not to mention the still well-established &#8216;ecosystem&#8217; on the enterprise side of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;a poor history of developer support&#8221;</p>
<p>The only true, valid and meaningful point in this sentence is the word &#8220;history&#8221;. Yeah, it&#8217;s HISTORY. RIM currently has far better developer support than Windows Phone according to some reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;dwindling marketshare in Europe and North America&#8221;</p>
<p>Completely irrelevant to BB10 as it refers only to their current premium product range, which is over a year old at this point in time.</p>
<p>Anything else?</p>
<p>We need more people like you that listen to facts. Everybody sees &#8220;Blackberry&#8221; and instantly assumes it sucks, had no chance, and that there needs to be a way to trash it. Then they switch subjects until they find it. Typical fanboys/haters&#8230;</p>
<p>Umm I think you&#8217;re agreeing with me</p>
<p>Having more hope for Windows Phone than Blackberry&#8230;</p>
<p>Such a sad statement!</p>
<p>I wonder what sort of developers care about that $100 incentive :P Curious that theres no mention of the kinds of apps that comprise the 15k number.</p>
<p>The devs were actually able to submit up to 20 apps for the $100 credit.</p>
<p>So a possible $2000. They&#8217;re also giving away 200 dev phones</p>
<p>Yes but what sort of developer actually has the capacity to put out 20 quality apps. Sure I can pull 20 Flashlight and Calculator apps in 37.5 hours. Are those the kinds of apps the blackberry store needs? I&#8217;m sure they mean well etc and its a good marketing strategy just so they can tout a big number of apps at launch. I just don&#8217;t think this campaign will net them the kinds of apps anyone really cares about.</p>
<p>Tbf I think the measure was more to incentivise getting independent developers arses into gear and submitting their app already, plus there was a push for porting of existing apps such as android, HTML 5, flash, unity etc and bb reps on hand for tech support. They weren&#8217;t really asking for you to make a new app, plus it&#8217;s better than what any other ecosystem is providing in terms of support.</p>
<p>Considering that most users do believe that the sign of an healthy ecosystem is the number of apps, Blackberry needs to have a high number of apps in their store even if most of them are crap just to tout a big number to consumers.</p>
<p>the kind of that has one app with 20 different content packs. 20 public domain ebooks as different apps etc..</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy to port Android apps to BB10.  The Dev basically just has to remove menu button functionality and change functions calling out to Android APIs to BB APIs.  Devs with a bunch of Android apps can spend a day or two porting them and get $2000.  The ease of doing it has become a problem because legit devs have had people pirate their apps and submit them to the BB store for the $100 reward: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/166lgt/developers_check_the_blackberry_store_for_pirated/" target="_blank">http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/166lgt/developers_check_the_blackberry_store_for_pirated/</a></p>
<p>20 fart apps for 2k. I guess that&#8217;s OK.</p>
<p>Only the number of apps matters</p>
<p>I sure hope they&#8217;re confident in this, hemorrhaging out a cool $1.5 million for 37.5 hours of apps.</p>
<p>Well in this game, coming so late in the battle you either come in big or don&#8217;t come at all I guess</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a lot of money in this industry.</p>
<p>True, but it kind of is for a company that isn&#8217;t really bringing any in at the moment.</p>
<p>During the last quarter they brought in $ 600 million in cash. So whats those $ 1.5 million? 0.0025%.</p>
<p>Sorry to be nitpicky, but I thought your figure might be wrong &#8211; move the decimal point over 2 places to get:</p>
<p>.25%</p>
<p>Your point still stands though of course :)</p>
<p>Can you link to where you say they brought in cash? According to</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonedog.com/2012/12/20/rim-fiscal-q3-2013-report-includes-2-7-billion-in-revenue-shipments-of-6-9-million-blackberry-phones/" target="_blank">http://www.phonedog.com/2012/12/20/rim-fiscal-q3-2013-report-includes-2-7-billion-in-revenue-shipments-of-6-9-million-blackberry-phones/</a></p>
<p>they had an adjusted net loss of $114 million.</p>
<p>When I say &lsquo;cash&rsquo;, I mean the economical term for &lsquo;cash&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s the money they actually have in the bank, available for operation and execution. The term in a quarterly report you have to look for is &lsquo;cash flow&rsquo;. RIM generated $ 600 million in cash. The loss you speak of is an &lsquo;operating loss&rsquo;, which is a different story.</p>
<p>For Apple, Microsoft, and Google&#8230;no. RIM is a different story</p>
<p>If you knew anything about RIM, they have plenty of cash in the bank and zero debt. But thanks for coming out.</p>
<p>Haha, compared to those 3? I&#8217;m pretty sure &#8220;plenty&#8221; does equate to tens of billions like those 3 (in order ~30, ~65, ~50). My point still stands. But thanks for coming out.</p>
<p>Your point doesn&rsquo;t stand at all. Your point was that $ 1.5 million is very much money for RIM in their current condition, which is plain bullshit. They have $ 2.9 billion in cash in the bank, up from $ 2.3 billion in the prior quarter. What&rsquo;s $ 1.5 million there? Yes, 1.5 of 2,900. That&rsquo;s peanuts for 15,000 apps, even if 14,800 of them are garbage.</p>
<p>Bottom line: you&rsquo;re just trolling and you know it. Thanks for coming out.</p>
<p>So are you telling me it only costs $10 million to get a 100,000 apps ecosystem started? How much did Microsoft spend? A billion?</p>
<p>Did they spend a billion on apps or are you trolling?</p>
<p>Where the hell did you get that number?</p>
<p>naah, AFAIK, they will only spent $500000 as said in the port-a-thon TOS.</p>
<p>You think that&#8217;s big spending?</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to approach developers more aggressively, good apps on WP is not on Win8 vice-versa&#8230;</p>
<p>I like how RIM is throwing money at developers, that will ensure a great app ecosystem ready by the time it launches.</p>
<p>Throwing money the way they are will just ensure a lot of crap apps for devs to get their quick buck and jump. Microsoft has a big enough problem with crapware in the stores as it is.</p>
<p>Microsoft Australia just ran 1 giving out Asus RT computers handed out to crappy devs. They can easily lure apps with high download counts to move to ensure quality.</p>
<p>It seems to me that they are not doing enough in this regard.</p>
<p>Crapware?  I guess you haven&#8217;t been by the Playstore</p>
<p>While I do think you are partially right, the emphasis here is for porting from android or iOS. I think RIM&#8217;s developer strategy has been much more effective overall.. versus the delayed WP8 SDK- that made no sense since small devs did not have good lead time to be ready for launch.</p>
<p> So yeah some crappy android ports will make the jump but so will some decent ones with no presence in the Play store. And your right MS has a problem. WP crapware is written from scratch not ported- be nice if there were some Android ports in the marketplace for the interim :/</p>
<p>Make no mistake RIM is coming from behind, but last year you might&#8217;ve said they had no developer support.</p>
<p>Nokia and MS also pay developers:<br />
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/nokia-microsoft-appcampus-2m/" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/31/nokia-microsoft-appcampus-2m/</a></p>
<p>What rock have you been under? Microsoft has some of the more aggressive measures to get devs to code for WP. They also happen to give away dev devices. It&#8217;s just because RIM actuiall reveals how much their top pull is, is what explains this massive frenzy of dour WP reactions. Calm your nuts folks.</p>
<p>Microsoft did exactly what you are suggesting since Windows Phone was introduced&#8230;doesn&#8217;t take more than a 2 second search to find that out&#8230;<br />
Unfortunately it was not successful&#8230;Windows Phone does have the majority of the big apps in the marketplace but also a lot of crap&#8230;<br />
The big issue is not the main apps but rather the app that the local bank makes or the local niche company makes that they only make for iOS</p>
<p>are you referring to the 46/50? lol</p>
<p>iOS and android are filled with crap apps 70% of the apps are crap or haven&#8217;t been downloaded. The apps argument is a dead one.</p>
<p>how many of these are android ported apps?</p>
<p>The more then better.</p>
<p>Considering how some of these android apps have had years of work poured into them</p>
<p>According to RIM it also takes less than 24 hours to port an iOS app to their platform, or in their words at GDC&#8217;12 &#8220;one fucking day&#8221;</p>
<p>How would you port an iOS app? There&#8217;s no possible way for iOS apps to work in BB10! Cocoa/objective C doesn&#8217;t work outside of OS X/iOS! And there&#8217;s no emulator/virtual machine that can run it!</p>
<p>They describe it here: <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting_ios_intro.html" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting_ios_intro.html</a></p>
<p>In less than 24 hours?</p>
<p>That is what they claimed at GDC&#8217;12</p>
<p>From a few months ago, all running examples. It is kinda impressive.</p>

<p>How many of those app submissions aren&#8217;t just pirated versions of Android apps?</p>

<p>Yes, I can&#8217;t wait till Android developers start suing RIM for this behavior!</p>
<p>Suing RIM for what? They may as well sue Google for making it so simple to download the APK in the first place. Google Play already has so much piracy they should worry about their own store before complaining about others. Further, you talk about downloading the APK and converting to BAR and then sideloading. By sideloading, you&#8217;re saying that it&#8217;s not in the BlackBerry store!</p>
<p>Seriously, read that article! I think Android developers would be outraged with the illegal porting to the blackberry app market without their consent! Not all android devs are going to want to upload their apps to the blackberry crap market! When android native apps won&#8217;t fully support all of the features properly!</p>
<p>Read the comments on that post! RIM seems to have some kind of website where you can just upload anyone&#8217;s APK file and it will strip the protection and convert it to BB10 market compatible!</p>
<p>RIM should take responsibility for this!</p>
<blockquote>Already there on the playbook, seems to work on pretty much all games, apps that utilise the camera and mic are the most troublesome.<br />
Fact is it&#8217;s easy to download the android apps and convert to .bar (if someone hasn&#8217;t already done it for you) and sideload them. Some have their quirks, mostly to do with the android back button and sub menus but are ultimately functional.<br />
The crazy thing is that developers are not doing this themselves, especially with the incentives BB are offering. As it stands either the pirates are cashing in or the apps are available elsewhere for free anyway. Regardless of the relatively small market place it&#8217;s still a missed opportunity for the sake of little effort.<br />
If the developers had no intentions of recompiling their apps for BB then they they aren&#8217;t losing anything if someone else does. Although it doesn&#8217;t make it right that someone else is cashing in either.</blockquote>
<p>This is a developer/android problem that won&#8217;t effect rim in anyway. Android makes it easy to get the .apk witch is why apps can be ported so easily. iOS and wp8 could be ported but there a lot harder cause they take the time to code there apps so that can&#8217;t happen so easily. If a developer sees there app in app world, there are easy steps to getting it removed.</p>
<p>If they see it there, that should be a sign that there&#8217;s a market for there app in app world.</p>
<p>Desperate, very desperate.</p>
<p>I never understood comments like this. Is the company desperate? Who is desperate? What for? What is your context, what are you trying to deliver as a point. Or is it all quite cryptic?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s deperate to the point that people are illegally converting android apps to the blackberry format without the orignal dev&#8217;s permission.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a lot of these so called 10,000 submissions weren&#8217;t done with the permission of the original devs.</p>
<p>ath0 already posted a link above about this! <br />
<a href="http://forums.theregister.co.uk/forum/1/2013/01/09/bb10_piracy_claim/"></a></p>
<p>Dev&#8217;s don&#8217;t need to waste time giving support to users who are running ported android apps without their permission. Many android ported apps won&#8217;t work properly at all!</p>
<blockquote>Many android ported apps won’t work properly at all!</blockquote>
<p>You missed the part about the approval process I see.</p>
<p>Does the approval process ask for proof that the original developer ported the android app?</p>
<p>evidently not.</p>
<p>can&#8217;t even get to comment on appworld that the 3rd party developer has submitted your thing without having an actual bb device to hook up. that&#8217;s right, the friggin appworld demands you to install a plugin which verifies that you have a bb phone/device.</p>
<p>So, there you have it! I guess most of the apps will be illegal ports of their android apps! I suggest android developer implement protecting using ProGuard and other mechanisms.</p>
<p>You need to get over it, dude. There&#8217;s probably 1 out of 10,000 apps pirated. If the dev has any problems, he can contact RIM and they&#8217;ll take care of it. You want RIM to run a background check and a credit check on someone submitting an app? Grow up with your pathetic comments.</p>
<p>Actually RIM does verify the identity of anyone creating a vendor account&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s probably lots! A person just mentioned one of many apps being ported illegally. Some of these pirates are selling free apps under their name!</p>
<p>This app is a stolen port!<br />
<a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/20081493/?model=Dev%20Alpha&lang=en">http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/20081493/?model=Dev%20Alpha&amp;lang=en</a></p>
<p>of this original android app which goes for free:<br />

<p>It&#8217;s one thing to port apps without permission, but then selling the free apps too without the original dev! If you see the app world right now, there&#8217;s many apps like these in similar situations!</p>
<p>Well that developer should contact rim to have the app removed. Easy as that</p>
<p>Ya you keep coming with the same tires bullahit argument, at first I took you seriously, now I see your just trolling.</p>
<p>LOL, hahaha I am not going to even waste my time goodnight.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait till january 30 for the verge&#8217;s review on the bb10 device! Wonder how it will fare!</p>
<p>I am not emotionally invested in platforms, even though I care about their outcome. But taunting other adults over an OS is childish at best. I have faith in The Verge&#8217;s staff to be unbiased.</p>
<p>I am not taunting! I am curious too! I like the multiuser login idea and other features from bb10! I also think that having ported android apps that might not run properly is also not good! So, I look forward to the review!</p>
<p>I see you are just a pot full of sauce, aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to call it now, because I can already see it&#8217;s ghostly outline front of my eyes.</p>
<p>The review will be &#8220;wow, this has a bunch of cool stuff, but its non-intuitive and really really rough around the edges, no where near as polished or as functional as iOS, Android. The built in apps do not compare, either. And then there&#8217;s the ecosystem, which frankly makes the WP8 app store looks well-stocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>and the withering conclusion,</p>
<p>&#8220;you&#8217;d have to be a real die hard BB fan to want to use this over the competition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sounds about right, sadly.</p>
<p>Bottom line: It will be a great platform in about a years&#8217; time.</p>
<p>I think the review might be</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, after you&#8217;ve learned those three easy gestures, it&#8217;s faster, easier and more intuitive to use than even iOS and Android. As RIM says it does really &#8216;flow&#8217; by any means. The built in apps are really polished, the messaging features and this state-of-the-art browser are going to be unmatched for a long time. RIM has also managed to bring in a good selection of quality big name apps to the table the average consumer wants. While BB World isn&#8217;t as full as the AppStorew or Google Play, it offers at least most major apps you want to have in place. The alternate platform to iOS and Android is finally here, in a well built and handy device considering a 4.2&#8221; 355 PPI IPS display. Buy it.&quot;</p>
<p>The approve process is to approve apps that work properly with the bb10 OS.</p>
<p>Why desperate? Then is Microsoft desperate since they&#8217;re also dumping millions/billions on Windows Phone without any decent results?</p>
<p>After over 2 years and 3 months on the market while losing money from Nokia and declining PC sales, I&#8217;d say yes.</p>
<p>Microsoft isn&#8217;t in a flat spin to bankruptcy like RIM.  It may be difficult times while MS goes through a lot of changes but RIM is make or break right now.</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s cash reserves grew $600 million last quarter (mainly from cost cutting) and still made $9 million in profit. Educate yourselves people!</p>

<p>RIM has $2.9 Billion in the bank, that&#8217;s far from bankrupted my friend.</p>
<p>Has The Verge written an app for BB10 ?</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;re busy now making the the verge ipad apps and android tablet apps!</p>
<p>The app looked fine on my Nexus 7 last I checked.</p>
<p>I presume Joshua said that they wanted to take their time and craft a proper ipad app for the verge and it&#8217;s definitely coming! They just properly want it to be properly done incorporating many of the site&#8217;s features in the native app!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re properly correct</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not bad at all actually, it hides the fact that it&#8217;s an upscaled phone app very well. However, some tablet optimizations would not go amiss.</p>
<p>The could probably port their Android app fairly easily.  Hopefully they do.</p>
<p>Bit of an inaccuracy in the article. They won&#8217;t be winning a Dev Alpha. It will be a Limited Edition BlackBerry 10 device.</p>
<p>No the article is correct, you only get a limited edition if u make an app and hand in your dev alpha within an allotted time frame.</p>
<p>step at a time, first quantity (measurable, marketable and available) then can come the quality which is difficult to do the previous 3 things quantity can.</p>
<p>ultimately quality is an on going thing, just think back on the first version of the ios facebook app and now, but atleast its there and available for improvement.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward for this device. I have the feeling that Blackberry may have a winner on its hands.</p>
<p>So it looks like a serious thing&#8230;.<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>I wonder how many of those apps are fart apps.</p>
<p>Way too many, unfortunately&#8230;</p>
<p>It would be nice if Google did the same for developers upgrading their apps for tablets.</p>
<p>Yes, that might help, but $100 or even $1000 is not even enough incentive to develop their mobile android app further into a tablet app! That&#8217;s not enough to pay a developer for developing the tablet app! It&#8217;s more expensive for the bigger brands to pay their devs!</p>
<p>Just take a good coder and then throw UI design to some students</p>
<p>Rim actually pays 100 per app, so a developer could walk away with $2000, if all 20 of there apps got approved. That&#8217;s not likely though</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care much for Blackberry phones and never will but I wish them luck!</p>
<p>Good for you.</p>
<p>Thanks lol.</p>
<p>RIM has gone all out with BB 10, its about to win the market or go out of business. i think some of the core apps like shazam, twitter, facebook, pandora and weather channel will be available on day 1. i like the fact that RIM is still going for the business phone, a simple UI with probably the best notification system.</p>
<p>though 342 ppi will be a bit of 2012, blackberry&#8217;s liquid crystal display will do the job, i think current blackberry&#8217;s display is great and bright. let&#8217;s just wish the processor is fast and camera is great</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be 355 PPI and those people RIM is aiming at don&#8217;t care about having 440 or 350 PPI at all.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 is only 336 ppi</p>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s a lot of fart apps!</p>
<p>wrong platform buddy. RIM are known for many things but this ain&#8217;t one.</p>
<p>A majority of which are just pirated android apps. That have been loaded in the blackberry converting tool and made into apk files&#8230;..</p>
<p>bar files mate&#8230;.and I do love their converting tool&#8230; /s</p>
<p>Pretty excited to see how this pans out. Everything looks pretty positive so far.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m counting down the days. I didn&#8217;t renew my contract when I got my iPhone 5. Now my contract is up for renewal bye bye iPhone hello BlackBerry Z10!</p>
<p>Cool story, bro</p>
<p>You must be kidding.</p>
<p>As long as you&#8217;re not planning on being able to run all the apps you had on your iPhone you&#8217;ll probably enjoy the switch.</p>
<p>Ill be switching from a iPhone 5 to a bb10 z10 as well.</p>
<p>Alright RIM learned from their mistakes. Finally.</p>
<p>If the number of apps is low, people will say BB10 will fail because it has no apps. 15K apps get submitted for consideration, people say all those apps are fart apps, they are pirated, etc. Haters gonna hate I guess. Lose lose situation with the public perception.</p>
<p>BB10 might be a decent operating system, but as one of the posters above said, there is an actual issue with people porting pirated android apps without the original devs permission.  This is hardly the way to improve your developer experience and ecosystem.</p>
<p>I agree and those issues were present with the PlayBook because people were sideloading the BAR files. RIM updated the OS to take away that tool. My point is that people are assuming that all of the pirate apps are pirated. Maybe they should give RIM the benefit of the doubt and maybe devs actually want to submit apps for BB10? That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying.</p>
<p>Not all of them are! But RIM should be more focused on promoting their own native sdk for devs so you can get good first party apps that conform to the design guidelines off BBX and also work properly with access to all api. Or else most devs will just take the shortcut and port their app, which might have limited potential.</p>
<p>Native apps take much more effort is the thing and therefore mean much higher costs for devs. And as we&#8217;ve seen it in the past, big devs won&#8217;t invest in platforms that aren&#8217;t released and have no user base. So RIMs take here is the right: offer both. Gain tons of apps for launch, even if they&#8217;re ported and haven&#8217;t much quality (just Android) to gain traction in the market and push native quality apps at the same time, which will hopefully take over as the platform has taken off and has a valueable user base. That&#8217;s what they do here and I think it&#8217;s the best approach to this chicken-egg-problem.</p>
<p>OMG don&#8217;t make this deal bigger as it is. RIM already reacted on this. Sure they can&#8217;t test each app on their own wether it&#8217;s a pirated one or not, but any Android dev whose app got pirated can contact RIM and the app gets removed from the Store. You just act as if each and every app that has been submitted to App World is a pirated one.</p>
<p>The thing is to throw as many spaghetti as possible at the wall, of which each one that sticks to it is a good one. So take these 15,000 apps and subtract those which either get not approved or are pirated and the remaining number will still be an important plus to the store. Every app counts. And if 15,000 ported apps contain at least 100 non-pirated quality-apps, it&#8217;s still a good thing for the product launch and future customers.</p>
<p>It would be better for RIM too if they promoted their own sdk for better native apps! Eventually developers would make RIM a side show after developing for iOS/android and then porting their android app to BB10. Having a native app is good so you can get good first party apps that conform to the design guidelines off BBX and also work properly with access to all api.</p>
<p>I know, but as I said it takes much more effort and many devs won&#8217;t take this route until BB10 has a valueable user base. And it&#8217;s not the case that RIM doesn&#8217;t promote their own SDK. They do. The tone is: &#8216;Port your app because it&#8217;s easy and fast and if you really want to take off and differentiate, go native&#8217; (recommendation). Thing is those &#8216;Port-A-Thons&#8217; are only ONE format of RIMs approaches towards Devs. Of course they also cater &#8216;Hack-A-Thons&#8217;, &#8216;Jam-Sessions&#8217; and webcasts, where native development is in the first row.</p>
<p>They do a very good job promoting their native sdk and cascades. This event was merely an initiative to get android developers to port their stuff over, but it was also open to all other apps native, air etc. Also, the android runtime in bb has been getting better.</p>
<p>Thank fuq someones paying attention, but if the major blogs dont report these things most users are too lazy to actually do any research for themselves. Surprisingly, the internet with its wealth of information has stopped people thinking for themselves more!</p>
<p>Here comes crap-apps. 1,000 YouTube apps, 1,000 facebook-touch apps, 1,000 flashlight apps. Rest is some none-sense.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t forget tons of weather apps</p>
<p>Dan Seifert will definetely switch in this case.</p>
<p>Just like iOS and android right? With 12,000 fart apps, 20,000 flashlight apps. Some people&#8217;s comments are so stupid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing BB10. I don&#8217;t know if I will buy one but the more competition in the mobile space the better.</p>
<p>Yummy yummy Qt apps.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to Microsoft&#8217;s mobile efforts is probably the possibility if a resurgent RIM.</p>
<p>I agree, rim will shut down any chances if wp being a big player.</p>
<p>The quality of those apps must be amazing! It is interesting though that you are trying to create positive hype around BB10 whereas on WP case you are usually doing the opposite.</p>
<p>How long will it continue is the question. Paying devs doesn&#8217;t work in the long term. To get the type of apps you need, throwing a few $ at random devs isn&#8217;t going to get to work.  You need the big names who aren&#8217;t going to be sucked in by money. Even Microsoft with all its money cannot entice the big names.</p>
<p>They got Angry Birds, that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>
<p>Lmao</p>
<p>I agree! Getting $100 to submit your app is the first step. Who pays for continued future development updates and what about email support?</p>
<p>The customers do, when they buy your app. If no one buys it then you have zero support costs and no problem.</p>
<p>If the app is popular and makes money, development will continue. If not it won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Simple as that and I would say that applies to any platform.,</p>
<p>The one too very obvious: SKYPE</p>
<p>I got a free playbook for porting my bad App Inventor app. I should make a few more.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lye, you had to port 5 to get a free playbook</p>
<p>15,000 in 2 days,  seems like RIM really thought this one through.</p>
<p>It all depends on what the 15000 apps actually are. If it was from a hackathon type event be assured nothing astounding is going to come from it. All it does is give flashy headlines for RIMM. I mean 15000 fart and flashlight apps will not get you anything.</p>
<p>Really pulling for these guys</p>
<p>Ditto. Blackberry has a large existing user base, they understand the importance of eco-system, and from the videos BB10 seems stable and able to offer a few features that others can&#8217;t. I really want for there to be another competitor aside from iOS and Android and I think these guys have a chance at being that. I have every intention of acquiring a Z10 when it&#8217;s available in a effort to support RIM.</p>
<p>Same +1 &#8230; Can&#8217;t wait to sell off this iPhone 5</p>
<p>Buying a phone to support a corporation is a stupid reason for buying a phone. Buy the phone because you like it and does what you need it to do for you.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know maybe you do like the look of the OS but buy it for the right reason.</p>
<p>Here are the apps:<br />
<a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/?model=Dev%20Alpha">http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/?model=Dev%20Alpha</a></p>
<p>These 2 look familiar..</p>
<p><a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/20081493/?model=Dev%20Alpha&lang=en" target="_blank">http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/20081493/?model=Dev%20Alpha&amp;lang=en</a></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.bigduckgames.com/" target="_blank">http://blog.bigduckgames.com/</a></p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t look the original dev &#8220;bigduckgames&#8221; gave permission to the new guy to sell his app on App World. The App world submitter has a yahoo email id! The game is the same one from the original dev&#8217;s website!</p>
<p>And he&#8217;s also charging $1.99 for it which is a free app on Google Play! Pirate wannabe dev thief!</p>
<p>Then that developer should contact rim and have it removed if he has a problem with it. You keep repeating the same comment. Almost would thing your a robot.</p>
<p>What kind of developer is going to be incentivized by $100?  15,000 bad Android ports.  No thanks.</p>
<p>As long as they can grab the most used apps between the top 2 OS&#8217;s right now, they should be ok in that regard.  # of apps does not matter, as 1 company likes to claim.  How many of those get used, and which one&#8217;s get used is what matters most.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/400000-apps-in-the-App-Store-have-never-been-downloaded-says-report_id32943" target="_blank">http://www.phonearena.com/news/400000-apps-in-the-App-Store-have-never-been-downloaded-says-report_id32943</a></p>
<p>Exactly, people think you actually need 500,000+ plus apps when 70% of them are never used.</p>
<p>Looking forward to getting my BB10.</p>
<p>If the leaked prices are the ones that the Z10 ($799) and X10 go on sale, RIM is dead. As in DEAD dead. I hope Thorsen is not THAT high</p>
<p>How the phone 5 16 fb is $899? Gs3 $699? So what&#8217;s wrong with $799, you mad you can&#8217;t afford it?</p>
<p>BB not going to win the mass market and probably wont win the corporate market.  They are going to have a very tough time IMO.</p>
<p>The OS from the looks of it looks like another android phone and the hardware, the front looks like the back of the iphone 5.</p>
<p>I just dont see the younger crowd from highschool through mid 20s going for blackberry devices.  THey will want to have a phone that does everything that everybody else is doing and will likely go iOS/android.  I just don&#8217;t see that changing.</p>
<p>The older crowd has moved on for the most part in the U.S from BB,  Corporations are allowing users to choose their devices and im guessing mostly iphones/samsungs are being selected.  There is nothing appealing about the blackberry other than previous BB users holding on to great memories on what BB used to be.  If somebody is looking for a new phone, chances are blackberry is behind int he line.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used a bb for work way back in 2009 for a few years and some last year, every device that my company got eventually had wear and tear easily within the 1st year.  By the end of the 2nd year forget it, need to replace.  .  The blackberry logo would start rubbing off quickly and keypads and ball tracker would start to fall apart.  I was new to bb at this point and had no idea why people would want this as their everyday device.  We had 600 users which eventually built a box for 200 defective BB- mostly curves/bolds.  Then we ordered about 250 Torch 9810s and about 40% of those were defective with about 20% defective out the box.  I just dont see BB devices as reliable and now since they dont have their bread and butter enterprise locked up, its going to be hard.</p>
<p>I Now have a lumia 920 for corporate use.</p>
<p>LOL. Don&#8217;t know what to say. It isn&#8217;t worth my time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The OS from the looks of it looks like another android phone and the hardware, the front looks like the back of the iphone 5.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the point where I gave up reading actually. Just saying.</p>
<p><a href="http://crackberry.com/exclusive-first-image-blackberry-10-superphone" target="new">Blackberry Z10</a> image was actually leaked last january before anyone had any idea what the iPhone5 even looked like&#8230; give up the look alike stuff already its corny&#8230;nd ur short story of a reply is based on BB OS not BB10 so you don&#8217;t know what the younger or older crowd will do</p>
<p>You clearly are clueless, and just like others I&#8217;m not gonna waste my time addressing your uninformed comment. But will say as a current iPhone 5 user switching to bb10, that statement alone invalidates your comment. As bb10 out specs the iPhone 5 and most androids. Bb had app launchers, icons, apps, and themes before android. And the z10 was leaked at the beginning on 2012 before the iPhone 5 was even released. So the back of the iPhone looks like the front of the bb z10.</p>
<p>I just fear that  among those gazillion apps that will be available at the launch of BB10 Skype won&#8217;t be included, making the future of the platform much uncertain.</p>
<p>Just because it may not come at launch doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t come at all, did iOS and Android have Skype at launch? their will be alternatives oovoo and faceflow&#8230;</p>
<p>Skype is owned by Microsoft who&#8217;s trying to push wp8, if its not there it&#8217;s has to do with that and nothing to do with rim/blackberry</p>
<p>For all the uninformed that will come in and comment later&#8230;this was an Android and Community(appcelerator, jquery, cordova, dojo, sensa touch, marmalade, qt, etc.) port-a-thon so these apps already exist, they weren&#8217;t created in the 37.5hours. Quality and quantity will be there, regardless of all of that RIM gets another win because these developers are now familiar with the platform so if they want to go native or consider porting another app they will consider BB10 when doing so. This was about the apps and the devs other devs now see the publicity and also consider BB10&#8230;</p>
<p>This thing will do pretty well imo. It carries a popular consumer brand &#8211; Blackberry &#8211; unlike WP which no matter how good it might be it scares people with the premise of &#8220;Windows&#8221; in their smartphones. Microsoft should&#8217;ve marketed WP under a different name, like they did with Xbox, and I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;re going to pay for it and WP will hardly get any traction, ever.</p>
<p>You know you&#8217;re not catching up with Samsung or Apple when little stores in Vietnam sell more slippers to people saying Apple, iPhone, and Samsung.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking at you Blackberry, tough luck in the emerging markets when everyone just wants an iPhone or a Galaxy Note 2 all over Asia. Companies like Nokia and Samsung are dominant all over southeast Asia and India and that&#8217;s just off of dumb phones. They&#8217;ve already started pushing so many ads for the S3, Note 2, Lumia 920 and still push older phones in those regions.</p>
<p>This is some press to launch a phone with. Good on them.</p>
<p>Gonna stick to Windows Phone</p>
<p>Are you really going to stick to WP or are you going to stick to a wirelessly chargeable PureView camera with a glove-friendly touchscreen and a good nav solution? I do honestly think it&#8217;s the latter. Well, added values over core values then.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t hear anyone talking about it.  No one I know wants one.  I think Windows phones stole the crowd because of the long ,long wait.  Too little, too late for Rim.</p>
<p>Maybe you and those you could possibly hear talking about it belong to the two third of the overall smartphone market RIM isn&#8217;t aiming at. I often read people stating they&#8217;re going to ditch their GS3s and especially iPhone 5s for the Z10 these days. People I think who belong to the one third of the market RIMs aiming at. We&#8217;ll see how late it is.</p>
<p>Are these REAL NATIVE apps or just cheesy resubmitted Android apps to run in their &#8220;emulator&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its like an author of pacman submitting a rom file for MAME in android and having google call it &#8220;WOW LOOK ANOTHER APP!!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that this article refers to one of RIMs recently held PORT-a-thons, how many developers would it take to build 15,000 native (quality) apps within 37.5 hours?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the problem here. Ports aren&#8217;t the only frontline RIMs fighting at, they&#8217;re pushing native development as well. At least the more apps, the better considering they have to solve a chicken-and-egg-problem here. The more apps get in there, the more quality apps are in total under the bottom line. At least they claim that they&#8217;ve got 90% of the top 600 iOS and Android apps already on board.</p>
<p>Unbelievable that people pull out negative spins on even 15,000-app-submissions-within-37.5hrs articles.</p>
<p>So if I quickly develop another fart app, will I get $100? Id really like to see what are those 15000 new apps&#8230;and if they actually bring value to the OS&#8230;.</p>
<p>Stop complaining about 15,000 apps within 37.5 hrs. There&#8217;s nothing to complain about. 400,000 apps in the AppStore weren&#8217;t even downloaded a single time.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/blackberry/2012/2/13/2796357/free-blackberry-playbook-extended-march-2nd">They&#8217;ve done this before</a>. What happened was as everybody says here, I wrote a crappy app, got approved, never release it (wouldn&#8217;t work anymore anyway, I killed the server). I&#8217;m pretty sure my free Playbook is still somewhere in my room. Even though they&#8217;re smarter, more aggressive, and offers more incentives, I still doubt that it&#8217;ll work this time around. It&#8217;s just a bad idea on a bigger scale.</p>
<p>I still believe that RIM would be much healthier company if they just focus on their services and start supporting other devices. Although it meant that they need to drop the device workforce.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I have to say to &#8216;crap apps only&#8217; commenters:</p>
<p>Icons of Skype and Gmail found in the latest BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha update:</p>
<p><a href="http://n4bb.com/skype-icons-blackberry-10-dev-alpha-latest/" target="_blank">http://n4bb.com/skype-icons-blackberry-10-dev-alpha-latest/</a></p>
<p>Talk about good money after bad. I don&#8217;t even need to see it to know that.</p>
<p>why does &#8220;glanceable&#8221; sound so familiar&#8230;hmmmm</p>
<p>This October though is going to be a hot bed of smarphone action. iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy SII, Nokia Lumia wp8, and Blackberry 10!</p>
<p>Widgets &#8220;stolen&#8221; from Android, rectangular shape of them from Metro UI, bottom menu from Symbian Belle and panel interface from Web OS.   ಠ_ಠ</p>
<p>On the other hand the camera app, notification gestures and so on are pretty cool. Let&#8217;s hope they have more of that comming later this year&#8230;</p>
<p>Notification gestures? Like Android, Web OS and iOS?</p>
<p>Apple shamelessly stole it and got away with it. <br />
just goes to show if you do something really well ( notifications on android) people will copy it directly and present it as their own innovation.</p>
<p>So just to get all the bases coverred: patents don&#8217;t prevent companies copying each other, and companies copying each other brings more value to the market as a whole.</p>
<p>Have I got that just about right?</p>
<p>Wrong! Patents prevent innovation. Copying is fair game.</p>
<p>Oh give me a break. They&#8217;re all stealing from each other, no one&#8217;s innocent. Which is why the patent wars are ridiculous. It reminds me of the scene in Matrix Revolutions where everyone&#8217;s pointing a gun at each other in Club Hel.</p>
<p>All of the companies just need to offer the best product they can, and let the consumer decide.</p>
<p>Exactly. I&#8217;m fed up of all these fanboys at each other&#8217;s throats over ridiculous crap. This is The Verge! Not Engadget.</p>
<blockquote>It reminds me of the scene in Matrix Revolutions where everyone’s pointing a gun at each other in Club Hel.</blockquote><p>That&#8217;s probably the spergiest, nerdiest analogy I could have imagined. Really? The patent wars remind you of <em>that </em>particular scene in the 3rd Matrix movie? Not any of the other countless cinematic stand-offs or free-for-alls?</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m glad that analogy ranked so high on the nerd scale. :)</p>
<p>Actually, I just watched it over the weekend, so it was fresh on the brain.</p>
<p>What did you have in mind or master of the idea!?</p>
<p>Yes, and Apple is not guilty of steeling ideas now&#8230;. Pffffff. hell its how they do business.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not wasting time explaining why. i think we all know.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs said they got the idea for notifications from Android.  Nobody at Apple presented it as their own innovations.  Why do you feel the need to misrepresent that?</p>
<p>can u link me with an article.. i dont think this is true.</p>
<p>Watch his address at WWDC when he announced iOS 5.  He states &quot;Any time, anywhere, you swipe down. Just like Android. Prettier version. Missed calls, voicemails, texts, scoring alerts, Facebook updates, Twitter, all notifications, stocks and weather all together. &quot;<br />
<a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/wwdc-2011-keynote-play-by-play-transcript-now-available/" target="_blank">http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/wwdc-2011-keynote-play-by-play-transcript-now-available/</a></p>
<p>You mean like how Google shamelessly stole the base of their OS from Sun and the interface ideas from Apple while they had a CEO planted inside the company on their board?</p>
<p>Complaining about similar gestures is like complaining about how typing on BB10 is like typing on iOS or Android. There are a finite amount of gestures and having some standardization isn&#8217;t all bad.</p>
<p>That was the one new thing I liked from the video; being able to swipe from corners to &#8220;do&#8221; things.</p>
<p>I have having to hit the same circle button either 1,2 or 3 (jailbreak) times to do the same thing over and over again. However, the overall experience is very simple and I never have to &#8220;think&#8221; about what happens if I &#8220;do this wrongly&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are tradeoffs with both approaches; Apple&#8217;s makes it really simple,e say, and quick, but downright boring to a nerd/power user. IMO of course.</p>
<p>Am i missing something? Android invented widgets?</p>
<p>Nah &#8211; but it&#8217;s kinda the OS which has them the most in the forefront.</p>
<p>While widgets exist even on feature phones (So called ELFs on old sony erricson features phones for instance) it wasn&#8217;t until android that they were really really popularised.</p>
<p>Though Symbian also really had them int he forefront.</p>
<p>This implementation though reminds me more of WP7 and it&#8217;s hubs and livetiles than traditional android widgets.</p>
<p>Who cares who stole what from who. Everyone steals from each other in order to make their products better. It&#8217;s always happened, every company does it, and it will never stop.   That&#8217;s fine with me if it improves my phone experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never understand why people speak about it like it&#8217;s the worst thing in the world&#8230;</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Android &#8220;steal&#8221; Widgets from OS X?</p>
<p>No. Widgets existed in Windows prior to OSX</p>
<p>Konfabulator (later known as Yahoo! Widgets) and DesktopX (Stardock) were on Windows prior to Dashboard (Apple Inc.).</p>
<p>Wow, there is so much wrong with facts in this thread it really astounds me how much people fail at simple fact finding/checking and just spew out garbage without a single clue.</p>
<p>Konfabulator was originally released on February 10, 2003 as a Mac OS X only application which cost $24.95.<br />
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konfabulator#Initial_development" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konfabulator#Initial_development</a>)</p>
<p>Also if any one cares desktop &#8220;widgets&#8221; or &#8220;accessories&#8221; were introduced in Mac OS 1 in 1984, which is where the &#8220;idea&#8221; of small, light weight apps which can run in the background come from:. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desk_Accessory)" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desk_Accessory)</a></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t mean to sound like a dick or nothin&#8217; but there are some really retarded &#8220;facts&#8221; here.</p>
<p>And the colour scheme is reminiscient of IOs. The rectangles also kinda remind me of the hubs on Wp7</p>
<p>That keyboard looked awesome, talk about innovation in software.</p>
<p>Hello Live Tiles?</p>
<p>My thought precisely..</p>
<p>Too late, it looks like another Android phone.<br />
Good Luck RIM.</p>
<p>It looks kinda like Android, but with a massive helping of WP7 concepts spread on.</p>
<p>Live Widgets lol.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d buy something that looks/functions like Android but without the lag.</p>
<p>Stop trolling dude. ICS is so much better than Honeycomb or Gingerbread. Seriously. Lag is mostly gone (and even iOS has some lag), and the interface is downright BEAUTIFUL (although you said you&#8217;d buy something that looks like Android, so yeah).</p>
<p>The fact that you say &#8220;mostly&#8221; gone shows that its still there.  I&#8217;ve not experience ANY lag on my Lumia 900, and it doesn&#8217;t need a quad-core processor to prevent lag, &#8220;most&#8221; of the time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s WP7&#8230;I didn&#8217;t mention WP7. I actually quite like the look of WP. I&#8217;ll probably buy a Nokia WP8.</p>
<p>WP has other things wrong with it btw. As Josh said in his review, (don&#8217;t flame me for agreeing with Josh) WP&#8217;s ecosystem needs to improve.</p>
<p>Android has (almost non existant now) lag, while WP has ecosystem troubles. Every OS has places where it can improve.</p>
<p>Android&#8217;s lag is still existent, just a whole lot less. Still not as smooth as iOS and WP though.</p>
<p>Well, Google can improve on that then. Something to look forward to for Jelly Bean.</p>
<p>I have a galaxy nexus right now (just came off of a Lumia 710) and the lag is still there. It&#8217;s especially noticeable since I just came from a WP7 phone. Maybe if I came from a phone running 2.3 I wouldn&#8217;t notice it as much, but any WP7/iOS user is going to see lag all over the place. Even the new. redesigned first party apps lag. Go into the calendar agenda and flick it, you&#8217;ll see significant lag/stutter. Gmail app still stutters. Play app stutters hard. etc..</p>
<p>Just go to WP7 and let true engineers over @ wp7 division handle the software rimm.</p>
<p>iF ITS TAKEN YOU THIS LONG TO PRODUCE SOMETHING capable of living in todays industry. I can foretell your update software path is going to downright suck.</p>
<p>Funny, I could say the same about the &#8216;true engineers&#8217; who built Windows Phone 7. Both are too late and need to go home.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Windows Phone should &#8220;Go Home&#8221; but they were definitely years late to the party&#8230;</p>
<p>Sigh more Android/Apple fanboys who only want two choices on the market.   I&#8217;ll never understand it.</p>
<p>Not pointing a finger at you, but in general, MS fanboys love the fact that the desktop OS market is a near monopoly, with only 2 players and little competition, and with MS at the top.They will always state MS&#8217; position in the Desktop market proudly.</p>
<p>But when it comes to the smartphone market, the same people yell &#8220;WE NEED A THIRD PLAYER!&#8221;. I can&#8217;t help but notice the obvious hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Well i think the desktop war of Apple vs. Microsoft had something to do about it.   And also fanboys from both sides were throwing shots and the easy go to is marketshare but I don&#8217;t think people were wishing Macs would go away.</p>
<p>There seems to be this movement of people saying Microsoft and RIM should just pack up shop and quit.      If WP makes it to 10% marketshare android and iOS can tout about being larger marketshare all they want&#8230;I just want them to push innovation on each other at the end of the day.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want either RIM or MS to quit the space. They should stay, and continue to innovate. In the end, everyone will have to copy everyone else (the patent litigation will soon stop, hopefully), since that&#8217;s natural for the market.</p>
<p>See how Apple revolutionized multitouch, and everyone else copied them off. See how Android invented an awesome notification system, and Apple copied them off. See how WebOS made a proper multitasking system, and RIM copied them off. The more the innovation, the better.</p>
<p>In the end, more competition = better products for the customer. <strong>By being a fanboy of one company, and not wishing well for other companies, you&#8217;re actually wishing for a stagnant monopolistic market.</strong></p>
<p>Time to move along.</p>
<p>The same can be said about Android users and when it comes to the tablet space they think there should be another player besides the ipad.</p>
<p>Heh. I wonder what they&#8217;d say about me? I prefer linux distros over Windows and Apple, and prefer Windows Phone over Android and iOS. [But Android over iOS&#8230;.]</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice, Android-man.</p>
<p>No problem chief.</p>
<p>Right, as if Android wasn&#8217;t late either. It didn&#8217;t pick up speed until Verizon advertised the Droid to the max.</p>
<p>Again, US-specific stuff. Android didn&#8217;t gain just because of the Droid. It gained because it was scalable. Even today, more than 80% of Android users are outside the US.</p>
<p>People in different parts of the world have different priorities. The biggest reason why Android succeeded was because &#8220;there was something for everyone&#8221;. Go to India, China, Middle East or Europe to see what I mean, People are buying Android phones in large numbers, and Verizon doesn&#8217;t have a single role to play there.</p>
<p>Lack of funding, perhaps?</p>
<p>Have to be cautious, here, but going off of the visuals? Is that it? RIM&#8217;s big deal looks like everything else.<br />
And personally offended by all efforts to change how we enter text &#8211; I&#8217;m pretty good thanks, Swype was great if you needed to send a text/email in a hurry with one hand whilst walking at a clip, but otherwise, I type, and my experience with Blackberry dictionaries was pretty bad.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 7: &#8220;Glance and Go&#8221;<br />
Blackberry 10: &#8220;Glanceable&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;RIP OFF&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great that we have two OSs that offer a &#8220;glance and go&#8221; kind of experience.</p>
<p>Countdown to first Blackberry 10 phone review, can&#8217;t wait to hear about their &#8220;lack of ecosystem&#8221;</p>
<p>RIM actually have an OK ecosystem&#8230;it&#8217;s just aimed at business more than consumers.</p>
<p>And WP has an &#8220;OK&#8221; ecosystem based on your opinion of RIM&#8217;s &#8220;ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>RIM doesn&#8217;t need as much of an ecosystem because at the moment they are still focused primarily on the enterprise.</p>
<p>But you are correct that WP ecosystem isn&#8217;t as bad as some people make it out to be.</p>
<p><strong>snickers</strong></p>
<p>If you can get android apps from the App world, the ecosystem category here would explode.</p>
<p>they do have Angry Birds.</p>
<p>BBM is a bit of an &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; of its own.</p>
<p>The video was garbage and whats the deal with the typing? It was taking forever just to get 6 words on the screen. Why on earth did they put that in that demo video? RIM is doomed!</p>
<p>I thought that too at first, but then watched again and it looked to me like they had the actor typing slowly on purpose just to show of the word completion up-swipe&#8230;</p>
<p>That looked cool at first, then it looked like a whole lot of extra effort.</p>
<p>Whole lot of effort?  lol what?    Its switfkey but the words are above the contextual next letter.</p>
<p>Yes, in my OPINION, it looked like a lot of extra effort. It may have been that they took extra time to type the message on the video to emphasize the capabilities of the keyboard, but it seem like you spend more time looking at the the keyboard trying to find the suggested word you may want instead of just typing.</p>
<p>There is no &#8220;May&#8221; in the demo video&#8230;they obviously slowed down so you could see what she was doing.</p>
<p>Even then, you aren&#8217;t forced to use it i&#8217;m sure&#8230;much like swiftkey you can just type normally if you want.</p>
<p>The person in the demo was alternating the typing from letter to letter and swiping up a word, back to letters&#8230;etc. I think it&#8217;s a great style. Something else to note is the keyboard actually looks like a BlackBerry keyboard design.</p>
<p>I still have a featurephone (Nokia 6500 Classic), which has a tiny number keypad that does double-duty as letters (standard mapping of &#8220;abc&#8221; to 2, &#8220;def&#8221; to 3, etc), so I use an esoteric predictive system every day.</p>
<p>Nokia, Motorola, et al. all had unique, arcane predictive text systems in the featurephone days.  I am as fast as most people with iPhones when I type on my 6500, because although the keys are small and stupidly laid out, I don&#8217;t have to type full words.</p>
<p>Predictive text also lowers the rate of errors.  My iPhone friends are plagued by autocorrect issues, garbled text, and the need to go back and correct.  Meanwhile, I rarely misspell a word; predictive systems are reliable- you learn that behaving a certain way is going to get you the word that you want.  Predictive systems largely take the issue of spelling out of the typist&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>I like this swiftkey-style thing.  Yep, just like the old predictive typing systems, your speed on the keys will plummet for the first week, but you&#8217;ll quickly learn what to expect, and your spelling and speed really improve because of it.  It combines the obvious benefits of predictive typing with the many benefits of a full keyboard.</p>
<p>At the very least it&#8217;s very clean. I like the UI. Very ICS-y, but with a worse font.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m not too sure about that font choice. Doesn&#8217;t have the business/professional-feel to it imo.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I know ive seen a similar camera timeline idea demod in a youtube video but i cant find that video</p>
<p>I like how the time on the phone was 13:37. ;)</p>
<p>good catch. lol rim</p>
<p>I imagine you&#8217;ll be able to switch between 12hr and 24hr clocks.</p>
<p>I think you missed the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=1337" target="new">joke</a>.</p>
<p>13:37 PM.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just dumb. You don&#8217;t need AM/PM on a 24hr clock. Can RIM do anything right?</p>
<p>Ha good point, their in-joke backfired</p>
<p>Its sad to see blackberry loose its &#8220;one hand-ability&#8221; but its nice to see them move on.</p>
<p>It looks and feels like a skinned verison of froyo/gingerbread&#8230; which is now dated.</p>
<p>But of course, what really matters it what it can do, which remains to be seen&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote>As you can see in the image below, these BlackBerry Dev Alpha devices are not running BB10, but instead a modified version of the PlayBook OS.</blockquote>
<p>If it was possible to do this why didn&#8217;t they do it a year ago?</p>
<p>I think RIM is under so much pressure that they are almost afraid to release anything that will not run perfectly right out of the gate.  At least if I were in their position I&#8217;d feel that way.  They aren&#8217;t in the same position as Google and Apple are in the phone market to be able to get away with releasing a new OS as early as possible that has a few bugs which can be patched later.</p>
<p>This is great news for my friends that are still using a Curve 8250! :D</p>
<blockquote>240 percent app growth in PlayBook apps in a single quarter.</blockquote>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that the quarter they released the Android emulator?</p>
<p>This actually comes across as an ICS clone for me. I must admit, I do quite like the keyboard concept though.</p>
<p>Kill it before it lays eggs&#8230;I am sure I am not the one thinking this&#8230;.just switch to Apollo/JB and forget that nonsense presented today.</p>
<p>That keyboard looks good, can&#8217;t wait till there is a comparable version on the Play Store. Everything else looks meh to the max, would have been awesome last year (maybe) but hey, BB fans are desperate.</p>
<p>With WP still struggling (insert preemptive MS fanboi flame retardant), BB might actually have some sort of slim chance of staying afloat&#8230; But only if they can start to release phones faster and shore up their relationships with Verizon and At&amp;t.</p>
<blockquote> But only if they can start to release phones faster and shore up their relationships with Verizon and At&amp;t.</blockquote>
<p>Gotta agree with that especially with this year Samsung and Apple&#8217;s rivalry is at one of the highest point yet, GS3 vs iPhone5. Let&#8217;s just hope the hype of those 2 phones won&#8217;t overshadow every other phone that is released this year.</p>
<p>Actually, I doubt Windows Phone will struggle much longer.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon finally decided that they will promote Windows Phones.</p>
<p>No matter how good the phones are, they won&#8217;t sell without carriers&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>It looks a lot like webOS, especially that email app. Which is a good thing.</p>
<p>I hope they don&#8217;t completely ditch hardware keyboards, though.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get what they are trying to accomplish. RIM put so much stock into their keyboards, BBM and messaging, but they are doing exactly what iOS, Android and WP7 already do. I thought people didn&#8217;t want all touch devices and that&#8217;s why people were sticking with the BlackBerry platform? This OS may very well be on par with Android and iOS in terms of functionality, but BB users want tools, not toys. I just don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>How many BB users are left out there?</p>
<p>Quite a few actually.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s diminishing in North America, increasing globally.</p>
<p>With the current rate of marketshare decline of BB, I think you could easily argue that most users actually prefer the &#8220;toys&#8221;.</p>
<p>When every year  iOS and Android each increases their userbase by TWICE the sum total of RIM&#8217;s entire userbase, it&#8217;s not difficult to understand why they&#8217;d finally choose to accommodate the users. The whole &#8220;tools not toys&#8221; premise is just a mantra BB users chant with no quantitative meaning behind it.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;toys&#8221; allow you to do a lot more than the &#8220;tools&#8221; of Blackberry nowadays. Sure, they still have to do some catching up with backend enterprise functionality, but on the user side, they offer far, far more than BB ever did.<br />
Personally I type also a lot faster on my 4.3 &quot; SGS II screen than I do on my BB Curve keyboard.</p>
<p>I hope their first device won&#8217;t have huge bezel like the one in the video.</p>
<p>Its a developer device.</p>
<p>I like whatever I saw on the video, especially the way a person&#8217;s avatar pops up when you receive calls and how you attend them and also the predictive text on the keyboard.</p>
<p>By the way, is it me or does that phone look humongous in her hands, for a BlackBerry device!</p>
<p>If this were released early last year it would have been pretty exciting to see RIM make a real effort at a comeback.. but this definitely looks to fall into the &#8216;too little, too late&#8217; category.</p>
<p>If and when what they&#8217;ve demonstrated actually ships it will be trying to battle the noise of the next iPhone, Android Jellybean a new gen of ICS devices and, possibly, Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>With Apple assaulting the enterprise, Android killing it with mid and low range devices and Windows Phone picking up the slack from both, It seems like RIM&#8217;s strongholds are under siege and they&#8217;re combatting it with what appears to be just another anonymous touch screen device and an OS that looks like a mashup of what&#8217;s already out there.</p>
<p>I was really hoping for something different from them &#8211; something that wasn&#8217;t another slate phone that may as well just be some faceless LG Android phone with a stupid name and a huge carrier logo on the front..</p>
<p>This is just a poor imitation, I can&#8217;t see a guy in a pin striped suit in first class using one of these.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to the keynote after it&#8217;s all done. I hope they post it up here.</p>
<p>Really cool looking but, this should&#8217;ve been out around the time of the storm. RIm&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p>Somehow, it reminds me of B2G.</p>
<p>Me too. Because both have a very similar bottom bar on the homescreen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big texter/typer on my phone, but that keyboard with the swiping suggested words is pretty damn genius.</p>
<p>I feel wrong for wanting this.</p>
<p>The typping feature sure looks impressive, but&#8230; I think it lacks some usability.</p>
<p>I mean&#8230; RIM appears to think that users remove their fingers from the front of the screen after every word they type. It&#8217;s ridiculous. In REAL WORLD I won&#8217;t be able to see these suggestions, side by fingers will be covering the keyboard. Duhhh.</p>
<p>Btw, there&#8217;s a reason autocorrection exist: because people simply can&#8217;t get everytime on to specific keys, because they are too small for our fingers. That&#8217;s why autocorrection exists. Now, RIM not only whishs I&#8217;ll be able to point to a specific region of the keyboard, but also SWIPE ON IT. My god&#8230;</p>
<p>I actually of the exact opposite opinion, in that I think that is the perfect placement for the predictive text to appear.  On other systems, displaying the suggestion above the keyboard forces me out of my typing rhythm.  Usually my finger is already on to the next key in the word, and putting it above the keyboard means I have to keep my eyes moving back and forth from the keyboard to the predicted text.  I have often wished that there was a way to press the next key in the word and choose the predicted word at the same time.</p>
<p>I see your point about missing the word because your fingers will be over it&#8230; but I honestly think that won&#8217;t be that big an issue in practice, just like holding your fingers over the keys is not that bid a deal.</p>
<blockquote>I <strong>am </strong>actually of the exact opposite opinion*</blockquote>
<p>The blackberry 10 is Ok. Is cool. Copying the iphone with this phone. Let me leave them alone, because Blackberry should have came out with this phone 2 years ago. Is NOW they pushing this phone out now, because they are about to die 100%&#8230; Smdh. iPhone and android is way ahead of them now. They done&#8230; Dead! Is the AppStore alone that will cause this phone die all together. Mark my words. People that had blackberry already switch to the iphone. BB was depending BBM as something that everyone needed in their lives. Oh well let see what happens&#8230;</p>
<p>Clearly, they&#8217;re not dead. Not even in the app space. If you watched their session today, you&#8217;d have seen some staggering growth in a single quarter. Anytime something improves by over 250%, that shows there is a lot of promise and action being taken.</p>
<p>No, I will not mark your words. In fact, I even want this OS to come out and I&#8217;m not even a fan of Blackberry. WP, BB, Android and iOS. Variety is the spice of life, my friend.</p>
<p>And are you really stupid enough to suggest that Apple is going to license their software?</p>
<p>I definitely want as much competition in the market as possible, but at the same time i dont see RIM pulling out of this nose dive and would almost rather it come to a swift end then keep watching this slow motion wreck.</p>
<p>Real quote taken from RIM&#8217;s employee guide for nurturing creativity:</p>
<p><em>If there is ever a time when you don&#8217;t have ideas of your own, steal from your competitors and repackage them using RIM&#8217;s U.G.L.Y. design standards.</em></p>
<p>I fear another patent war is on the horizon.</p>
<p>Sauce?</p>
<p>At least they&#8217;ve tried to make the first solid leap in virtual keyboards since the suggested words toolbar in Android.</p>
<p>A neat looking hybrid of WP7 and WebOS(as a former pre plus user, this makes me smile), sure some of the elements seem unecesarily complex(touch the persons name, THEN decide to answer or end the call) but at the same time they seem like a joy to execute; in short, I like it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m truly a lost cause as I&#8217;m never going to buy a Blackberry, but I <em>really</em> want to try out this OS, preferably on Venue Pro like hardware.</p>
<p>Good for a laugh of two, I guess. RIM is dead by the end of 2013 so none of this really matters. It&#8217;s an organization managed by bozos who still don&#8217;t understand why they&#8217;re being punished by the global markets.</p>
<p>WebOS/HP, Motorola, HTC, LG, and Nokia failed to build long-term, profitable businesses around smartphones. What makes anyone think that a company with no history of consumer-friendly software can deliver a product on top of a viable platform in the face of fierce competition?</p>
<p>Since when was HTC not a profitable company?</p>
<blockquote>being punished by the global markets</blockquote>
<p>BB is actually seeing most of their growth in global markets. It&#8217;s the higher echelon markets where they&#8217;ve lost significant market share.</p>
<p>This is too ironic :) I love how you start off with &#8220;good for a laugh or two&#8221;, and then make a totally incorrect statement about RIM in global markets. I mean, did you think it made you sound smart because you used the term &#8220;global markets&#8221; heh heh :) :) Thank you for providing the a &#8220;Good laugh or two&#8221; :) :)</p>
<p>Blackberry is still a strong brand the name can sell this device but if it retails for 199$ competing with the iPhone5, Android Jello and WP8 I have to say no.</p>
<p>*Jelly Bean</p>
<p>&#8220;Android Jell-O&#8221; might warrant some heads to pop up at the legal offices of Kraft Foods.</p>
<p>So far, absolutely nothing about BB10 suggests that RIM has come up with anything that can&#8217;t be done on an iPhone or Android device.  That&#8217;s the problem here; RIM can&#8217;t just churn out &#8220;An iPhone but worse.&#8221;  It needs to do something that its competitors don&#8217;t, because consumers already have tons of choice when it comes to touchscreen slabs.  Even security isn&#8217;t a given, considering that RIM is using a new OS and advances are being made with iOS and Android security features.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, things like the camera are the exact type of thing that RIM <strong>shouldn&#8217;t</strong> be focusing on.  People don&#8217;t buy a Blackberry for its camera, and RIM will never in a million years best Apple, Samsung, HTC, or Nokia in that area.</p>
<p>agreed</p>
<p>So many people so passionate about their smartphone that they are stuck in this ridiculous mindset that all other smartphones and smartphone manufacturers must fail.  Religions people show more respect for others that don&#8217;t share their beliefs than you people.  This is beyond religion.  Some of you are flat out nuts over very stupid things.</p>
<p>i cant agree anymore. since i live in Canada and not having bbm makes you a social outcast, plus i love my playbook. i cant wait to own a new bb device with bb10</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-22/blackberry-loses-top-spot-to-apple-at-home-corporate-canada.html" target="_blank">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-22/blackberry-loses-top-spot-to-apple-at-home-corporate-canada.html</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just leave this here.</p>
<p>Yeup. That&#8217;s the mindset I&#8217;m seeing.</p>
<p>Amen. I work at one of these companies and so my job actually depends on this stuff. But even then, it&#8217;s not a religion, and i don&#8217;t want anyone in any of these companies to be losing their jobs. That&#8217;s a lot of families out there.</p>
<p>Sure, but mostly I hear people pointing out that RIM is trying to take on the big boys on their terms, not RIM&#8217;s.  What aside from brand loyalty is RIM trading on right now?  I am sure they will sell some BB10 devices, but stake a claim in the current cuthroat (but expanding) mobile market?  I can&#8217;t see how, based on this.  Hope I&#8217;m not anti-family for saying so!</p>
<p>By the way, I&#8217;m all for OS makers copying each other&#8217;s UI successes, but I see some of this going on in BB10.  Realistically, how many patent lawsuits is RIM going to be able to fight with its meager war chest?  This is a real hazardin thew current market.</p>
<p>as a BB 9300 user, i use my BB mainly because of a decent physical qwerty keyboard, the lack of this option just make this another iphone wannabe&#8230;.</p>
<p>other than that i like the playbook mini design, the non removable battery its a bad trend that need to stop</p>
<p>I signed up just to reply to this post.  Why all the hate?  Can&#8217;t you just like what you like and I like what I like?  I know alot of people that use BlackBerry devices.  I have my phone and 3 PlayBooks.  I am happy with my devices and am excited for BB10 but I am not bashing iOS, Windows Phones  or Android.  Yes, I have used them all.  BlackBerry does for me.  Thank you for a good article.  I can not wait to get my BB10 device.  Thanx 4 the space.</p>
<p>Fanboyism is like religion to people, y&#8217;know?</p>
<p>I love using tech, and whatever suits me best or what I like, I&#8217;ll use.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m a BB user of 5 years. still using one now.</p>
<p>I have only one thing to say.. BB suck.</p>
<p>If they full touch to compete with Apple and Android, then I&#8217;m going either Apple or Android for my next device.  Losing what made BB great is a big no.</p>
<p>I have a 9810 and love my physical KB but I will get this device and hope there is a 9810 form coming.</p>
<p>so BB is ditching the only good things they have going for them (keyboard and mail programme) and going full touch screen.. against Apple iOS 5 and soon-to-be-released iOS 6 and Android ICS.</p>
<p>backing a dead horse comes to mind.</p>
<p>doesn&#8217;t RIM have an advertising campaign going no right now touting the superiority of their physical keyboard system (able to answer 1000 emails per day) over virtual keyboards?  I guess that was Horse Hockey after all.</p>
<p>There is certainly some promise here, but the lack of any kind of release date is a bad sign.</p>
<p>Did Rim mention any target date at all?</p>
<p>This has been in the works what seems like forever and in the meantime iOS, Android, and WP will continue to be refined and developed.  The alternatives are already very mature platforms.  Rim needs to get this out the door already.</p>
<p>quit the comparing apples to oranges people. wait till bb10 is in your hot little hands and then do the comparison. stop wasting everyone&#8217;s time on innuendo. Bottom line is the graphic shots in the BB10 commercial look <strong></strong>stunning. Lets see what <strong></strong>ecosystem<strong></strong> is created at launch.</p>
<p>Pretty promising stuff, I hope it works out for them. BBOS would be an excellent contender in the smartphone race, instead of WP.</p>
<p>Actually, Windows Phone is an excellent contender.</p>
<p>In fact, you can buy Windows Phone right now.</p>
<p>I see a lot in the video preview to like but time will tell.  I&#8217;m worried when BB says that everything runs in the background all the time because I want to know what that does for battery life.  I doubt I&#8217;ll leave my iPhone for this but so far I like what I&#8217;ve seen here a lot more than WP7.</p>
<p>Am i the only one who is reminded of pintrest from their homescreen</p>
<p>Will there be any BB 10 models that combine the touchscreen and a a physical keyboard? Because a LOT of people stick with BB because the prefer physical keys. Get rid of the keys, and most people would probably rather have an iPhone, because of its huge app catalog.</p>
<p>exactly my view.</p>
<p>the reason i&#8217;m still with BB is:</p>
<p>1. keyboard<br />
2. simple push email implementation<br />
3. battery life</p>
<p>BB 10 appears to kill 1 and 3, what&#8217;s left is no match for iDevice or Andoid i&#8217;m afraid.</p>
<p>PlayBook battery life is amazing.  BB10 device should be up to that battery life.  My daughters have 10+ apps running on their PlayBooks all day from when they wake up, until I put on the charger when they go to bed.  I use mine almost as much.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how good the Playbook is in any way, shape or form, because there&#8217;s nothing good available for it from an application or accessory point of view. It&#8217;s disappointing, but true.</p>
<p>I think this is dead on.  People rightly note that phones with hardware keyboards are a niche, but that could be <strong>RIM&#8217;s</strong> niche.  RIM simply cannot compete in the touchscreen slab arena unless they come up with a feature that would entice someone to buy a BB10 device over an iPhone.  So far, RIM hasn&#8217;t shown that.</p>
<p>it reminds me of the early concept of Windows MOBILE 7, that microsoft killed in favor of the Metro Windows Phone 7</p>
<p>RIM really needed to show a prototype device today and they didn&#8217;t that<br />
suggests they&#8217;re rather far behind and imo the chances of a BBX device<br />
this year are likely to be slim or insanely limited</p>
<p>that explains why their shares took a bit of a hit today<br />
 </p>
<p>what a shame as BBX looks great, hopefully BBX will still have an impact a year from now when we finally see devices</p>
<p> check this out, it&#8217;s a good article.<br />

<p>Many comments are pertaining to how RIM has &#8220;stolen&#8221; widgets from Android and apps for Apple, however, RIM has released an update allowing their product to be able to download and use from the different app worlds, which means they have been granted permission to do so, as RIM is not stealing profits from the other companies as Android and Apple is receiving profit margins from their sales.</p>
<p>Looks like Android with an OEM skin</p>
<p>Ugly one at that&#8230;</p>
<p>So like most OEM skins.</p>
<p>Seems like a lot of swiping going on, like they set the learning curve to over 9000.</p>
<p>I think the &#8220;flow&#8221; ui looks rather interesting.  I&#8217;m not sure if RIMM will be able to make a comeback with this, but there are some genuinely interesting pieces in BB10.</p>
<p>It looks like Meego of N9. and Meego seems better than this. IMO</p>
<p>The fact that this can go directly to the notification area is a plus over meego. In meego any swipe brings you back to your last screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m looking at an discussion over which is better, BB10 or Meego&#8230;</p>
<p>That pretty much wraps it up for RIM as far as I&#8217;m concerned.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m sensing sarcasm, but meego was actually a very well designed OS, from what I could gather, so there&#8217;s not problem in comparing.</p>
<p>Just like comparing to WebOS, which despite it&#8217;s failure, still features an UI design I&#8217;d argue is better than iOS, Android, and Windows Phone, for a cellphone platform.</p>
<p>Two quick swipes isn&#8217;t a real problem in SwipeUI. Further, the overhead when switching from one notification app to another (one of the most common use cases) is one swipe and a click. In addition, the closing swipes can do more than just minimize an app. Making a left to right swipe go straight to notifications wouldn&#8217;t be difficult.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t the amount of swipes. The problem is that you lose the &#8216;glance and go&#8217; ability that comes from bieng able to show your notifications without quitting the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 9000&#8221;</p>
<p>I see what you did there?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not nearly as bad as WebOS, which although I might be the only one here to say so, was actually a really strong OS.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a shame they coupled it with crappy hardware (both before and after HP bought them) and didn&#8217;t do so much in the way of advertising it. It also didn&#8217;t help that they spoofed the iPod USB ID in order to make it work with iTunes rather than either writing their own syncing software or using the proper API&#8217;s Apple have for accessing the library.</p>
<p>I agree the OS was elegant, attractive and innovative in places. Crappy hardware, scheduling and marketing did much to kill the product.</p>
<p>However I think you will find that Apple does NOT supply API&#8217;s for third party hardware syncing. So whatever ever Palm did do in the past would of been made null and void by a software update to iTunes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/apple-third-party-read-palm-pre-itunes-sync-not-supported-an-update-away-from-not-working/19826" target="_blank">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/apple-third-party-read-palm-pre-itunes-sync-not-supported-an-update-away-from-not-working/19826</a></p>
<p>agreed. I don&#8217;t know enough about development to know whether the concept of web-standard-based app design was a good idea or not, but the basic UI design was excellently thought out. It shows in that both android and Windows Phone(and iOS, to a lesser extent),  copied the cards concept to some degree. Having menu settings be in the status bar is a great unobtrusive way of adding options and power features. Gestures were brilliant. Universal search. All-in-one messaging solutions. I miss it.</p>
<p>Yep. Pretty much.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t care less, but their swiping gesture to unlock the device seems like it might violate the swipe to unlock. Predefined direction. Personally it looks similar to Touchwiz&#8217;s unlock screen where you swipe up a picture or Windows Phone where you slide the picture to the top like a window shade.</p>
<p>Maybe they licensed it?</p>
<p>Someone remind me who it was that before rim created the effect of previewing the home screen as you swiped to unlock?</p>
<p>Zing.</p>
<p>Did anyone really, honestly expect anything novel and outstanding from RIM at this point? They had their chance, I am pretty sure they will drift into irrelevance very soon.</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;ll be bought soon.  My mate just sold his old car so odds are on him for the time being.</p>
<p>You know what would be insane&#8230;Google buys RIM</p>
<p>More shocking than that &#8230; APPLE buys RIM.</p>
<p>Or Google and Apple team up to buy RIM and more importantly, RIM&#8217;s patents.</p>
<p>HP buys RIM! Didn&#8217;t Meg Whitman say HP needed to be in the mobile space? Although after what they did to Palm&#8230;&#8230; :-(</p>
<p><strong>sigh</strong> HP (or IBM) buying RIM makes sense from the whole &#8220;business sales&#8221; standpoint, but after the way HP handled WebOS, I REALLY hope they don&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an iPhone user, because I feel it&#8217;s the best mobile OS out there <strong>dodges Android hate</strong>, but I&#8217;ve loved RIM&#8217;s hardware, own and use a PlayBook, and want RIM to succeed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my patriotic duty as a Canadian, frankly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used quite a few tablets (iPad 1/2/3, Nexus 7, Playbook, Kindle Fire, Nook Color) and the playbook was not that great.</p>
<p>The design was quite&#8230;boring. Basically the only thing I liked about it were the swipe gestures which worked extremely well. Other than that the software was buggy, slow to start up (apps), and the UI was completely inconsistent&#8230;<em>everywhere.</em> Worse than Android in &lt; 2.1 days.</p>
<p>The SDK was alright, but you had to download components from many different vendors, install them and get them to work together. When you compare this to Android (Has a single main downloader) or iOS (Everything built into Xcode install) it was a royal pain. It was nice that you could port Android apps, but it only supported a subset of the API&#8217;s, and did not allow apps using native code (So only Java.)</p>
<p>I hate to see RIM disappear like this, but I am afraid it is still too little, too late.</p>
<p>That was Apotheker&#8217;s fault&#8230;</p>
<p>Actually,  csco combination would make a lot of sense, They both target enterprise, csco already uses qnx, and rimm is now relatively cheap</p>
<p>How about Microsoft buys them to obtain and control the corporate side of RIM (corporate is where MS is counting on WP to take off) and get the patents of course.</p>
<p>that would be pretty awesome if Windows buys a 50% share in RIM</p>
<p>RIM has corporate??? I Don&#8217;t think so, I have 300 employees and only 10 have blackberries. Our crew carries Android and Windows devices. Oh yeah, did you read in the last week or two, HP has remove RIM from the employee cell phone offerings completely.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a difference between business and corporate. I think you sound like you have a business, and probably a successful one, but not necessarily something that would be categorised as a corporate. That&#8217;s just my tuppence.</p>
<p>Not arguing, but many people in corporate setting now use iphones. This is a fact, not an opinion; iphones and androids are everywhere now</p>
<p>I work for an organization with thousands of employees. We have 1000 BES licenses (run our own BES). Over the last 3 years, we went from using ~900 down to ~350. The people who keep them are departmental administrative types (not technical), who are increasingly dropping them.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for the day we get rid of BES. Hell, I&#8217;d be all for BB10 if it could just sync with Exchange w/o BES.</p>
<p>300 emplyees isn&#8217;t corporate, its a SMME,</p>
<p>You know this surely</p>
<p>The fact he has exactly 300 employees and he has the privilege info that exactly 10 have Blackberries makes yah wonder about some of his/her facts&#8230;</p>
<p>I see Microsoft buying them more than Apple or Google. Apple also isn&#8217;t known to buy big companies like that, they buy smaller companies with some specific set of skills and technologies rather than a huge company with skills all over the place.</p>
<p>The most I&#8217;d see them doing would be buying their patent portfolio, but I really can&#8217;t see them buying the company as a whole.</p>
<p>Thats is RiM&#8217;s problem. They are all over the place and no particular killer skills. I do wish them the best however and it would be exciting if they could kick up a storm. I am sure that RiM has many followers in sleeper mode just waiting for a great device and OS experience.</p>
<p>I think RIM will join Microsoft. Just like Nokia they are too proud to adopt Android.</p>
<p>Not really pride as such. With Android you really lose your identity to some degree. Hence the skinning madness. Look at LG, Motorola and Sony great devices from each of varying degrees but everyone wants HTC or more so Samsung. Those are the better devices with the best of the &#8216;Skins&#8217; whether liked or not. So some uniqueness as created by the Skins is strictly needed to stand-out. Only the hardcore who are the minority in a big way want stock Android on such devices.</p>
<p>i had thought something would &#8220;wow&#8221; me since thorsten was all &#8220;boy oh boy we got something cooking and its great.&#8221;</p>
<p>but its all pretty lackluster.</p>
<p>I agree, and can you imagine trying to get your corporate employee to learn all of those swipe gestures??? They should follow the KISS rule, &#8220;Keep It Simple Stupid&#8221;. If they had a chance, they&#8217;ve just shot themselves in the foot. I&#8217;m an IT manager and can already her my users calling asking how to do this or that.</p>
<p>When my mother says I got something good on the cooker for you I smile and feel at ease looking forward to a tasty home cooked meal (Apple, Nokia, Samsung and HTC) However when my beloved sister states the same claim I order a take out or pray (RIM)</p>
<p><img src="http://storeshopnow.com/mm/imada/itit2.jpg" />Oh it&#8217;s all right i guess, but still people are gonna buy iphone instead. <img src="http://storeshopnow.com/mm/imada/it2l.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not just boxy shell but boxy icons too. <br />
Boring icons, no side scrolling gestures ???<br />
They have taken away essence of WebOS. For some it may be fine but I wanted it to live on !!!</p>
<p>WebOS swipes and notifications are still the best way to interact with your phone IMO. I still remember the first time i played with my girlfriend&#8217;s Pre 1, it was so good and intuitive. Too bad Palm ran out of money so soon.</p>
<p>I &lt;3 playing with my girlfriends Pre.</p>
<p>Wait, what are we talking about again?</p>
<p>I agree. The &#8220;Card&#8221; system is still the most intuitive and easy to navigate multitasking implementation. For the first month after ditching my dead Pre for an EVO 4G I found myself continuously swiping up from the bottom only to make a sad panda face.</p>
<p>This was a developer conference and not for showcasing the OS to consumers, hence none of the flashy stuff. Just the stuff that matters to us developers. They&#8217;re saving the flashy stuff for the final announcement.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think RIM has flashy stuff. It just doesn&#8217;t seem to be a part of their build. If girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice; boys are made of snips and snails and puppy dog tails; then RIM is made of spreadsheets and mails and business meeting entrails.</p>
<p>Forget &#8220;flashy stuff&#8221; try to get an everyday consumer to figure out &#8220;No no you swipe up THEN right. no don&#8217;t swipe up and take your thumb off you have to.. no in one motion.. no UP THEN RIGHT!&#8221;</p>
<p>Customer puts down phone and buys iPhone.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re that stupid, you probably should consider feature phones.</p>
<p>You have to stop thinking like a tech head and more like your sweater loving aunt.</p>
<p>Looks like Boot2Gecko.</p>
<p>Firefox OS*</p>
<p>You mean looks exactly like a Motorola phone and a Motorola skin?</p>
<p>Agreed. Just by mere looks, it looks like Heins showed up one day and said &#8220;OK. Guys. I just installed [Atom Launcher/Go Launcher/etc] on my Droid&#8230;.and I luuuuvs it. This. Is. How. The 10 should be like. Run with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>More like MeeGo Harmattan.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was my first thought, too.</p>
<p>It looks enough like Android that I&#8217;m not sure why they didn&#8217;t just build this as a skin on top of Android, just so they could have the Android app support.</p>
<p>maybe because the security and infrastructure they already have in place?</p>
<p>Ah, perhaps.</p>
<p>QNX can already run android apps, can&#8217;t it? ;s</p>
<p>Yes it can. BB10 will also run Android apps.</p>
<p>Can Android run multiple Apps at the same time?</p>
<p>Yes, but its app switcher is not quite as slick as the Playbook.</p>
<p>You know, not having software buttons to inadvertently hit and no hardware buttons is a pretty huge distinction from ICS/JB. It&#8217;s more like webOS — and that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>No hardware buttons on the face, that is.</p>
<p>Cool Dieter had 3 hands!!!</p>
<p>The thing with Android is that some devs are just going to build in functionality if they see that people really like what BB is doing.</p>
<p>This OS looks really smooth and slick but I&#8217;m not impressed. <br />
<img src="http://static.thehollywoodgossip.com/files/mckayla-is-not-impressed_454x374.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yeah, it looks good&#8230; mmmm<br />
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0p1piZOOE1qjzps9.gif" /></p>
<p>Say FLOW again!!!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always disappointing to see another row-upon-row of icons based OS, I know BB aren&#8217;t looking to innovate, and there are some nice touches shown in the OS, but I&#8217;m just so tired of the stale rows of icons approach. Fingers crossed WP8 is all its cracked up to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much my opinion too &#8211; the screens-of-rows-of-icons paradigm has become stale for me. Please, please WP8, be a worthy competitor (I say this as an iphone &amp; nexus 7 owner).</p>
<p>WP (at least WP7.5) has also rows of icons. With just one app per row. Which can not be sorted at all. Which actually sucks more than a grid of icons which can be sorted.</p>
<p>The point with WP is if the App is that important you would have it on the home screen which you can organize and resize.  I rarely go to my app list view.</p>
<p>I do because I use quite a number of apps and just typing the first letter in the list and then the app name is faster than scrolling down my long home screen made of another grid of icons.</p>
<p>Also you can organize the home screen but you cannot use folders (except if you jailbreak your phone). The major advantage is of course that these icons can show dynamic information. But in the end is also just a grid of icons.</p>
<p>Um, you did see how that&#8217;s not really the main interface right?</p>
<p>That said: how do you propose the phone determine what apps you want to launch? Telepathy?</p>
<p>honestly WP8 is not THAT different.  the live tile thing is ok when it works, but it&#8217;s still a row of icons.  just a little bigger, and with ugly colors when the tile isn&#8217;t live (which is most of them).</p>
<p>Not to mention live tiles are nothing  but dumbed down widgets. You can even get an app for Android to make it look exactly like it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hrIeCTjPk" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_hrIeCTjPk</a></p>
<p>All without putting up with IE or Bing either.</p>
<p>Live tiles are not widgets. Widgets are standalone applications. Live tiles are &#8220;windows&#8221; into the application. When click on a live tile it opens the associated  app and can deep link you into the app.</p>
<blockquote>Live tiles are not widgets. Widgets are standalone applications. Live tiles are "windows" into the application.</blockquote>
<p>Exactly, like a less functional widget. An app widget can provide the same functionality and more<br />
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/appwidgets/index.html</a></p>
<p>Intents are also more advanced deep linking.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not expecting WP8 to be a whole new approach, I know it&#8217;s not, but it is relatively fresh and somewhat different to use. Like I said, I just find Android and iOS so stale, WP8 is just a welcome distraction from the norm. Real progression in a mobile OS is hopefully going to come from a small design company that will help generate innovation and shake the market up. (Before being bought by one of the big players of course.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s RIM&#8217;s app strategy for BB10?  Are they still planning on making it compatbile with Android apps?  Looks to me like they might be specifically designing app UI to be compatible with Android?<br />
<img src="http://cdn3.berryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Blackberry10VideoDemo2.jpg" /><br />
Note the back button (as there is no physical back button on the phone) and Android-like 3 dots for options&#8230;</p>
<p>BB10 will run Android apps.</p>
<p>badly</p>
<p>Try the PlayBook version 2.1, you&#8217;ll be surprised</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t the 3 button&#8217;s for options a Window Phone thing first?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Ellipsis points. Not really an Android thing any more than using an arrow on the back button, it&#8217;s just a logical symbol for the purpose.</p>
<p>yeah, and those 3 android dots were copied shamelessly from Windows Phone.</p>
<p>The hardware itself looks like an ugly Lumia.</p>
<p>Active Frames reminds me of that iOS jailbreak app I use to use. As in it&#8217;s nothing more than useless eyecandy. I can&#8217;t imagine what functionality it provides over simply showing you a list of your top 8 apps by name and icon, as iOS does but without the top 8 limit. Live Tiles is much more useful. This is no better than Android&#8217;s multitasking view, which is little better than simply showing the icons as iOS&#8217;s recent app list does. It looks prettier, but it doesn&#8217;t actually do anything more.</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t desktops here. No one really needs to view screenshots of two apps at the same time on a small screen. A few people want too, but they definitely don&#8217;t need to.</p>
<p>If this is all they got, then they&#8217;re in the same position as they were yesterday. Dead.</p>
<p>This is basically fancy live tiles. The apps keep running in the back ground and can display information in the &#8220;Active Frame&#8221;.</p>
<p>The thing about live tiles is that you can have more of them than 8. And yes, if devs take advantage of them they will basically have the same effect as live tiles. For some reason I didn&#8217;t connect that dot. Sorry. But that still doesn&#8217;t make it better than Live Tiles.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why they keep coming up with the number &#8220;8&#8221; here.  That&#8217;s not correct, the only limit is available memory</p>
<p>I am pretty sure they said that the 8  currently running apps would be displayed as active frames. I am sure available memory will also be a limiting factor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really and exact analog for live tiles. This only shows you currently running apps I think. I would agree that the live tiles idea is a little more useful than only showing what is currently running, but that isn&#8217;t a fair comparison as these &#8220;Active Frames&#8221; also do double duty as an application switcher.</p>
<p>The hardware is a dev prototype so not consumer hardware.</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s anything like the PLaybook then the active frames are still running programs and the multitasking puts Android to shame.</p>
<blockquote>and the multitasking puts Android to shame.</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s what most people want in multitasking on a small screen.</p>
<p>1. Something to click to show them their other open apps.<br />
2. The ability to select one of those apps and quickly switch to it.</p>
<p>Anything more is fluff.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re confusing &#8220;what most people want&#8221; with &#8220;what android is capable of giving&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition, so-called running apps in android often are <strong>not</strong> running &#8211; the developer must specifically code to use multitasking capabilities.  Under BB10 it&#8217;s automatic.</p>
<blockquote>so-called running apps in android often are not running</blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t care. Neither does your mom. Or neighbor. Or random guy who was behind you in line the last time you were at a convenience store.</p>
<p>But they might care about being able to quickly switch between apps. Keeping apps in memory makes switching as fast as possible. Swipe up, tap, done. You don&#8217;t have to wait for the app to load and it will be just how you left it.</p>
<p>U can&#8217;t see the benefit of having four running apps visible on your screen at the same time?Really<img src="WoW!" alt="" />, don&#8217;t wanna believe ur that ignorant, so  im gonna assume ur just a hater.</p>
<p>at least it looks better than windows phone</p>
<p>Survey says?! XXX!!!</p>
<p>Aww. Sorry. Now, the Johnson Family has a chance to steal.</p>
<p>Maybe an android skin from moto 2 years ago.</p>
<p>I love when I can&#8217;t see what website I&#8217;m on.  Why would they even bother with the address bar?</p>
<p>Assuming this will work like the playbook, swiping from the top bezel down to the screen will reveal the address bar. A second swipe will reveal your open browser tabs and browser options.</p>
<p>Address bar is at the bottom.</p>
<p>Did you see the screenshot?</p>
<p>It said &#8220;m.the&#8221;  FIVE CHARACTERS. What use of that to anyone?</p>
<p>The page title is at the top of the screen. Also, you are looking at the page, you just navigated there, why wouldn&#8217;t you know what page you were on? If you need to see the url, tap the address bar. Done. You are reaching.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like a very polished OS&#8230;</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t had enough time to polish it.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t polish shit! don&#8217;t care what myth busters says.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zTiuD.jpg" /></p>
<p>Well call it a pig, it&#8217;s the best underlying OS out there. Can iPhone run multiple Apps at the same time? &#8230; Well there is a real pig, and an old one at that.</p>
<p>Two words: battery life.  If these BB apps are all running and showing live tiles, I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb and say battery life will not measure up to the best performing competitors.</p>
<p>If BB can do that without impacting battery life compared to the competition, that would be their killer feature.</p>
<p>No, that would be magic.</p>
<p>Actually, no. It would be progress.</p>
<p>hey microsoft do it all the time, it works</p>
<p>Apple manages it every year.</p>
<p>Not enough time?!? lol</p>
<p>It does for it being a BlackBerry. Sure that&#8217;s not saying much, but I think you know what I&#8217;m getting at</p>
<p>Beta. Beta. Beta. It says beta right in the title.</p>
<p>Beta means finished. Didn&#8217;t you know?</p>
<p>Actually is &#8220;Dev Alpha B&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe they&#8217;ll run out of money before it reaches pre-release and we can finally be done with blackberry.</p>
<p>It sounds like you want to be done with Blackberry. Why?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m forced to carry one around from work.  I have to maintain the BES.  I want to be done with it.</p>
<p>Then stop trolling here, quit your job and look for a new job somewhere else. Jesus&#8230;</p>
<p>New to the internet?</p>
<p>yawn</p>
<p>This is totally different from the old system. Why can&#8217;t people get that through their thick skulls?</p>
<p>Becasue people find it fun to bash RIM.  I guess they think it&#8217;s funny. Whatever, I&#8217;m upgrading my 9930 the day the QWERTY BB10 devices are on sell.</p>
<p>Blackberry by choice.</p>
<p>Nothing another 12-15 months won&#8217;t fix :)</p>
<p>- RIM, 12 months ago.</p>
<p>At this current state, its intended to be used by developers. the level of &#8216;polish&#8217; shouldn&#8217;t matter until weeks/months before it&#8217;s final release</p>
<p>Can I ask you a question or two? Uuh, I&#8217;m asking anyway:</p>
<p>How many blackberry devices have you seen in cell carrier stores?<br />
answer:  one, maybe two</p>
<p>Is RIM going to open there own stores or via internet/mail order??</p>
<p>Cell Carrier have programmed their salespeople to sell Apple and Android only; I wish them luck</p>
<p>In the UK they&#8217;ve still got a number of good carrier relationships, so there&#8217;ll be an in-store presence. Whether it&#8217;ll be big enough to carry them over to H1 2013&#8230; not so sure.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what this has to do with my response.</p>
<p>&quot; these are not widgets or live tiles, but the actual running applications displayed in thumbnail form. &quot;</p>
<p>So more like Meego N9</p>
<p>Exactly what I was thinking. Seems like Blackberry&#8217;s rationale here was looking at the N9 and thinking &#8220;how can we make it less intuitive for a regular user to pick up and use and not have to worry about Nokia suing us?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Haha, yes.  Meego&#8217;s pinching paradigm was the first one that peeked my interest since webOS&#8217;s cards.  I think this one is functional but not nearly as pretty as Meego N9 pretty.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s pique not peek (unless of course you were aiming for a pun but i don&#8217;t think so&#8230;.)</p>
<p>peek-a-boo<br />
mountain peak<br />
pique my interest</p>
<p>Thanks, I&#8217;ve been doing it wrong the entire time.</p>
<p>sure thing mate.  appreciate you not being a sensitive turd about it like many would be.</p>
<p>personally i would rather someone tell me than keep making the same mistake.  for instance, my wife keeps poking fun of me because i kept saying gun-ho instead of gung-ho and i&#8217;ve been saying gun-ho for a long time like an idiot.</p>
<p>cheers.</p>
<p>Except that the multitasking is based on QNX multitasking and this was already in the Playbook 1.0 which got released at least 6 month before the N9.</p>
<p>maemo was made in 2005, and n9 is based on that.<br />
nokia n900 predates playbook, even the ipad.</p>
<p>This seems to be a bit of a stretch. Are you claiming that Playbook OS copied something from Maemo from 2005? If yes what?</p>
<p>Now it is true that Maemo predates Playbook OS. But I don&#8217;t see what this has to do with anything?</p>
<p>Did iOS copy from Maemo too since it predated also iOS? What is your point?</p>
<p>Looks like it &#8220;borrows&#8221; generously from Nokia&#8217;s swipe UI.</p>
<p>Nokia&#8217;s swipe UI/ Multitasking tray, iOS app drawer, and Android&#8217;s quirkiness.</p>
<p>Also WebOS&#8217; swipe up gesture for card view</p>
<p>I wonder if all those features are Bad in anyway to have it in a Phone, I guess not, so since every other phone already barrows from BlackBerry features, I can&#8217;t see any problem, and of course it doesn&#8217;t look all that polish is a freaking &#8220;Alpha B Device&#8221;..</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything wrong with having all those gestures in a phone except that the sheer number of gestures will turn off potential new users looking to minimize learning curves.  Something BB can ill afford as it attempts to re-ignite growth.</p>
<p>You have to make a trade off between having a powerful and flexible UI and having an easy to learn UI. The more ways you add to interact with the device, the steeper the learning curve, but you sometimes get more powerful interactions. RIM is intentionally targeting this device at users who are willing to learn the UI. They will face a similar problem as Microsoft is facing with educating users on the windows 8 UI.</p>
<p>I understand what you&#8217;re saying about the learning curve, but I honest think this phone will be harder the Win 8 UI. I&#8217;m currently using window 8 Pro on my corporate laptop as I&#8217;m a MS  Enterprise Agreement holder and the gestures in win 8 are more simplistic than I&#8217;ve seen on this above video. I have user that have been using Android and Apple devices for 2+ years and still don&#8217;t know how to do certain things, I thing there might be to many gestures for them to remember.</p>
<p>There are three gestures.</p>
<p>up to go to home screen from within an app <br />
Right to &#8216;peek&#8217;. <br />
up and right to &#8216;peek&#8217; from within an application</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just not as complicated as people here are making it sound, and is extremely intuitive.</p>
<p>There are more than three gestures, but I agree with you. Giving this a second look the gestures are very simple. The basic gesture is swipe up from the bottom. You can do everything you need with only that gesture if for whatever reason you don&#8217;t want to learn the rest.</p>
<p>I think we need to wait and see, but usually there is never just one way to do something.  perhaps the peek gesture may seem too complicated for the avg joe to use, but I suspect that it will not be vital to use the phone.  peek seems to be aimed for power users.  I know many people that use the mouse to click everything on their computer and never use simple keyboard shortcuts like ctrl+x, ctrl+v etc&#8230;.</p>
<p>Nokia swipe UI in the N9 was released after the Playbook which already had most of the gestures.</p>
<p>maemo had those features in 2008</p>
<p>Maemo in 2008 did not have the same these gestures the Playbook introduced in 2010. Not even close.</p>
<p>Not sure why everyone is under the impression that Nokia had the swipe UI technology. The Blackberry Playbook had it before the N9!</p>
<p>oops, you slept on webOS</p>
<p>Did Nokia make webOS?</p>
<p>And if you want to get really technical — HP is the one who suffocated webOS by sitting on it.</p>
<p>nokia de made maemo which predates both</p>
<p>So what is the relevance? For example MS-DOS 5.0 or Windows 3.1 also predates both.</p>
<p>Looks ok I guess, but I think they need something completely new and exciting in order for them to make a come back. It looks to me like WP8 is going to kill them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their game plan is to do a half baked, unpolished version of Android with no app support.</p>
<p>Victory!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Android got to do with it?</p>
<p>They&#8217;d have been better off launching an Android based OS, but spent the last couple of years developing their own Enterprise locked down variety, that way they&#8217;d have app compatibility out the box, but Blackberry&#8217;s communication, messaging &amp; enterprise benefits there too.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t see this turning around their fortunes, no one will be attracted in although Blackberry is very popular with UK teenagers, so this may stop them trading up to Android/iOS in future</p>
<p>Actually the plan is not to release BB10 until is &#8220;Fully baked&#8221;, that&#8217;s the main reason this is going to be launch next year,  in regards of the apps at least they have a lot more of the big app developers on board this time.</p>
<p>let see what they release next year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s based on QNX</p>
<p>This OS is so much more capable than Android your comment is just silly. But good try!!</p>
<p>How is WP8 going to &#8220;beat&#8221; BB when WP is also losing marketshare?</p>
<p>Is windows phone losing marketshare, or is windows mobile6 being lumped into the same box?</p>
<p>but is BB10 losing market share or is Blackberry OS being lumped into the same box?</p>
<p>Really, this bizarre dichotomy needs to stop. why do people afford this second chance so openly to MS (now a third chance because WP7 was a failure even compared to Blackberry OS (which continues to sell more) and now everybody should bank on WP8, the third chance). Yet they are so quick to call doom even when RIM continues to sell more than them and replaces Blackberry OS with the completely new OS just like them i.e. QNX based BB10? Why, I ask you do people garner these irrational thoughts.</p>
<p>WP needs to gain marketshare first. You need to have something inorder to lose it. 4 million is not market share ; )</p>
<p>4 million WP7 devices we sold by Nokia alone in 1 quarter.</p>
<p>Fug.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, sure. Functionally, I&#8217;d say not. Simple yet powerful gesture swipes are the way of the future, and as such, I think this is a step in the right direction. I&#8217;ve been saying it forever — design is more than aesthetics.</p>
<p>Well if gestures and swipes are the future, why are people complaining about the swipes, gestures and cursor movement in Win 8? I think the swipes, gestures, and mouse movements are simpler in win 8. I didn&#8217;t thinks I would like using window 8 Pro in the enterprise, but I&#8217;ve loaded it on my laptop, joined it to my domain and have been using it. I think its more functional and intuitive without the start menu. To me it operates as if I&#8217;m using hot keys allow me to access items quicker the searching through list to find items. I only see the start screen when launching the desktop. When I get my surface in Oct. , I see it out in the field.</p>
<p>And RIM expects to get back into the game with that? It&#8217;s barely on par with Windows Phone 7/8 and the want to compete with iOS and Android? lol nice try RIM.</p>
<p>why don&#8217;t just wait for the final version of the phone and then compare to win8 phone? since this is not the final product.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t seen the final version of Windows Phone 8 either.  Still I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s completely unfair to compare what has so far been revealed.</p>
<p>Unless the Win 8 they announced is  an testing  &#8220;alpha&#8221; b device, then the comparison is not very fair.</p>
<p>I have installed the BB10 SDK and checked it out. As far as the SDK and APIs are concered it has already more features for devs than WP7.5 ever had. WP7.x was locked down.</p>
<p>Also the native programming for BB10 makes apps start and run quite snappy by default.</p>
<p>With respect to WP8 SDK that remains to be seen when Microsoft releases the SDK to everybody.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how you have determined it is barely on par with anything. From what has been shown and from developer feedback this device is on par with all of the other major smart phone platforms (iOS, Android, and WP8). It is lacking app support. You could &#8230; wait, why am I feeding the trolls&#8230;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s there in Windows Phone 8 other than small, medium and large tiles. BOOM!</p>
<p>And the NT kernel and most of the Windows 8 API so I can easily port games and apps between W8/WP8/Win RT.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more and if you are trying to excite devs and potential customers that video made me dislike rim&#8217;s products even more.</p>
<p>If this is not a Nokia MeeGo-Harmatta rip-off then I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p>Well, since Nokia killed it, this is fair game. It also has Qt just like the N9.</p>
<p>I totally agree,  specially since the most famous Android phones already look to similar to Iphone, and for all the people missing WebOS, this features included in here that&#8217;s going to be a very attractive.</p>
<p>You got it wrong. BB10 is based on the Playbook OS. Since most of the gestures etc. where already in the Playbook which was released before the N9. MeeGo was rather a rip-off of the Playbook (and WebOS).</p>
<p>Ah . .  that explains the confusion.  Nobody actually used the Playbook to know what gestures it used.</p>
<p>lmao</p>
<p>Underneath the boxy exterior ends up being a hacked N9.</p>
<p>I wonder if the actual device is in there, just hidden inside that ugly case&#8230;</p>
<p>iPhone KILLERRRR.  /trolling</p>
<p>I bet if you throw it hard enough, it might kill an iPhone or two.</p>
<p>Nonsense. The iPhone is made out of solid metal. It&#8217;s indestructible. Why do you thing samsung started releasing bigger and bigger phones? You see where it got them. /s</p>
<p>Not bad RIM, not bad. Just a year or two too late, &#8230;</p>
<p>At least 2 years late to the game. WP and BB the bastard riding the short bus to get their asses kicked.</p>
<p>Oh god RIM, get ready for a nice fat lawsuit with Apple for having multipage grids of icons on your screen.</p>
<p>My palm pilot had that in 1997&#8230;</p>
<p>My Newton had that in 1994</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Newton also have the &#8220;android app drawer&#8221;?</p>
<p>My Atari ST had that in 1985.</p>
<p>Looks really bad. I feel sorry for RIM. They can never catch up. Even Windows Phone is like light years ahead of them.</p>
<p>based on what? looks?</p>
<p>If so, he doesn&#8217;t really understand what most Blackberries are used for.</p>
<p>yes, for email. how sad is that. email is not even the major way of communication anymore.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what your talking about &#8211; because it is in enterprise.</p>
<p>Obviously you have never used a Windows Phone.</p>
<p>yes I have and it&#8217;s much smoother interface that at least makes sense and consistency. this looks lika a soup of borrowed ideas from all OSes in the market.</p>
<p>I will say that it looks one hells of a lot better than the current BB operating system (whatever its called) with its menu-based user interface.  So to the extent they can interest corporates that want to stay with the mobile hardware provider they know (not to mention the back-end), they may be able to stem some of the bleeding in the West.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but I think this OS is really different than the current icon based systems with gestures incorporated. And those icons are huge and the texture they use make the look extra block like. Again, I wish BB luck, but I don&#8217;t think this will help them. Do you really think they will be able to steal enough of Android and Apple&#8217;s market share to survive?</p>
<p>Why won&#8217;t they just hire a graphics team to make their core apps not look like they&#8217;re from &#8216;03?  Good core usability concepts, powerful phone..I trust RIM w/ hardware design..but their software&#8217;s always been ugly.  Just hire someone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty cool, I hope RIM can keep it together.</p>
<p>When you switch from Personal mode to Work mode does it announce that "Amateur Hour is Over"?</p>
<p>No, but I&#8217;ll bet there are developer hooks for that :-)</p>
<p>iOS icon grids, WP7 tiles, WebOS and Android swipe left/right menus&#8230; It&#8217;s like they strung together bits and pieces of every mobile OS that has been out for the past 5 years and then slapped a Blackberry logo on it.</p>
<p>It might be &#8220;enough&#8221; for enterprise deployment though.</p>
<blockquote>Android swipe left/right menus</blockquote>
<p>The swiping for menus &#8220;underneath&#8221; the UI actually exists on both iOS and Android, but your point still stands.</p>
<p>I hate to criticize but this appears much difficult to use.</p>
<p>The gestures look so unintuitive&#8230; And saying that this looks like N9/Meego/Harmattan is an insult to N9&#8217;s beautiful UX.</p>
<p>Yeah.  What&#8217;s with that &#8220;L&#8221; gesture.  WTF?</p>
<p>Thank you very much! Someone is finally talking with some sense</p>
<p>Anyone remember when BBs had wheels on the side? So that an enterprising individual could operate the entire phone with one hand? And then then they made the curves with some of the greatest qwertys ever? The UI was never the best, since day 1 RIM has made ugly phones with ugly UI, but functionality was supreme.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s going to learn all these dumb gestures? The swipe-up/down thing is going to be a total bitch once you&#8217;re in apps or the browser. People often don&#8217;t hit the right targets when scrolling or moving the scene in apps/games.</p>
<p>Even the pulldown notification on the iPhone is awful for usability. It always interferes with games and video scrubbers.</p>
<p>I use these gestures on a Playbook and they work really well. It took me 5 minutes to get used to them. Now sometimes when I use WP or Android I accidentally try to use these gestures. I really prefer them over stupid long presses of buttons or lots of back button presses.</p>
<p>Haha same here. I swipe my iPhone like its a play book all the time now. Takes 5 minutes to lern for a lifetime of not hunting for the home button in the dark.</p>
<p>The swipe down gesture won&#8217;t be used that often on the phones. It is for settings and bedside mode. The gestures are designed to be used one handed with the thumb if necessary. As the two other fine gentlemen have stated, the Playbook&#8217;s gesture based UI is awesome. I expect this to be equally as fantastic.</p>
<p>Dude, how many people in the corporate environment do you know the use their phone with one hand???? Especially BB; they will have a lot of un-training to do after all of these years using BB Bold, Curves, etc with keyboards. C&#8217;mon Man!</p>
<p>I own and use a blackberry. I only use two hands when typing. When navigating around the device, reading emails and web pages I use one hand. When I am answering a call or talking on the phone, I use one hand. When I take a picture, I use one hand. One handed use is important to &#8220;Blackberry People&#8221;.</p>
<p>U use two hands to work the trackpad, nice!</p>
<p>Thinks always look smooth on the release demo video&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;This could turn out to be the never released STORM III&#8230;&#8230;.or Hurricane Katrina the sequel</p>
<p>WAIT A GOD DAMNED MINUTE!!! How does it look on a belt clip?</p>
<p>Like the second one:<br />
<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RUrDAl1ywe0/TfGD76tgRDI/AAAAAAAAAAU/vEQwgHhMA3k/s1600/cell+phone+belt.jpg" /></p>
<p>Gestures look really unintuitive. Plus it&#8217;s missing the holiday period. Is the majority in agreement that RIM is screwed? Their only real USP now is their physical keyboard which is best in class. but irrelevant.</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s physical keyboard are the best. I love the feel of their Blackberry Bold and Torch smartphones. If I could get an iOS Device with the Blackberry Torch form factor, that would be IT for me.</p>
<p>Definitely seems like its game over for them here in the U.S., but perhaps not in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Gestures aren&#8217;t intuitive. They only seem easy after you&#8217;ve learned them.</p>
<p>All those gestures are confusing and I would hate to have to remember all of the,. It&#8217;s like playing Street Fighter back in the day and trying to remember the moves, let alone doing them correctly. Zangief&#8217;s wrestling moves were always hard to do</p>
<p>I could never figure out Dhalsim&#8217;s yoga teleport.</p>
<p>Lol, me neither</p>
<p>I own a PlayBook and honestly once you use it for a bit, you get so used to the gestures that, when I grab my iPod Touch, I start swiping to do things, so I only see the gestures in BB10 as a good thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll ask again, &#8220;How many people in the corporate environment do you think will be patient enough to learn them&#8221;? Hell, I had people send Android devices back in favor of the old BB Bold because the said it was too much to learn. We need to think outside of us techies here who are willing to learn this stuff. Your average consumer does want to re-learn how to use a cell phone; Phone should be difficult to use, all they really want to do is: make phone calls, sure the web, text, and take pictures. THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER!!!!!</p>
<p>The base gesture is swipe up from the bottom. You can do everything else from there. The average consumer isn&#8217;t an idiot. Perhaps the dumbest consumers won&#8217;t get it, but I would hate for RIM to design a phone for the dumbest consumers.</p>
<p>When the BB10 Bold comes out (probably won&#8217;t be called that), let me know if those same people send it back because it is too much to learn.</p>
<p>Erm, you mean all <strong>three</strong>?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;d hate to see you tax your brain.</p>
<p>All those gestures?? Dude!there&#8217;s only three.</p>
<p>Did you hear that&#8230; 50+ year old business men in offices across the nation just jizzed in their pants.</p>
<p>&#8230;after taking a double of Viagra</p>
<p>Just like the wierd gesutures on the iPad and iMac</p>
<p>What?!??</p>
<p>Those are magical gestures, given to mankind so that we can all live in peace and thrive in the walled garden and eat of the sacred fruit.</p>
<p>Never, EVER diss iOS on the Verge. For this is the chosen land, where unicorns frolic with fuzzy hipsters. Beware.</p>
<p>lol such sarcasm</p>
<p>Spoken like a true bitter Android &#8216;unicorn&#8217;.</p>
<p>I call DOA. it could be the greatest OS on earth, but this is a very crowded market and there is no way that the BlackBerry name alone will Save RIM.</p>
<p>RIM still has bigger marketshare than Windows Phone, it can retain position 3 if the flagship is decent.</p>
<p>Lol so true, but the fans don&#8217;t see it that way. Blinded by the windows blinds.</p>
<p>It took Palm like 2 years and 1 HP to die. I figure RIM still has some time.</p>
<p>You know, this isn&#8217;t actually half-bad, though I can&#8217;t help but wonder if they should&#8217;ve built this as a skin on top of Android, just so they could have the Android app support.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s about 2 or 3 years too late, I think.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t think this is too late specially since android have just put their sh*t together with ICS/JB and Win 8 is just coming later this year.</p>
<p>here the real test will be the appeal to the people and the &#8220;apps&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>They already have Android app support in BB10 anyway.</p>
<p>Except Android suck compared to QNX.</p>
<p>Pretty much.  I&#8217;d much rather have Android adopt QNX.</p>
<p>Everyone hates Android skins. Amazon is the only one who has pulled it off with some degree of success, and their OS isn&#8217;t really a skin, they changed far more than most skins do. RIM made the right choice by going it alone. Look at HTC, LG, and countless other Android vendors. Exclusive BBM and RIM infrastructure support wouldn&#8217;t be enough to set RIM apart from other Android manufacturers. By going it alone and making something that is truly different, they have a better chance of people looking at it and saying, &#8220;I like the way this works, better than my current device&#8221; instead of, &#8220;well I like my samsung android phone, what is RIM offering that I don&#8217;t already have?&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a mashup of every  mobile OS. You have Android widgets, Windows Live Tiles, iPhone icons, WebOS cards, and even Facebook&#8217;s side menu. It&#8217;s not original, but it&#8217;s a mix of everything a user should be familiar with at some point in the smartphone lifetime.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a brilliant strategy as long as you don&#8217;t get sued for it.</p>
<p>Maybe if you steal enough from everyone, no one can sue you because it doesn&#8217;t look enough like their product.</p>
<p>wait a minute&#8230;.so if those active frames are active, are you running all your apps all the time? sick battery management tactic, RIM</p>
<p>Not exactly the same thing, but on the Playbook you can choose to have all apps running all the time, the main app running until another app goes full screen, or main app running until it loses focus.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t know about showcase  mode and brag about Android multitasking.   lol  :)</p>
<p>It was always a urban legend that in real multitasking a &#8220;running&#8221; app equals CPU time. This was never the case. In real multitasking systems like BB10 most running apps are blocked 99% of the time waiting for user input. Thus no CPU cycles.</p>
<p>Apple just got away with conving users that single tasking and permanent opening and closing of apps does not suck. MS than copied the task switching for WP and Windows 8 Metro apps.</p>
<p>Exactly, this whole multitasking = poor battery life argument is nonsense. Perhaps that&#8217;s how things work on iOS (because of how they built it), but it is not universal. Didn&#8217;t apple used to say they didn&#8217;t have cut and pasted because it caused security problems or something? And didn&#8217;t they say flash caused OS X to crash or something? The point is, Apple is basically Mitt Romney. They say whatever they want and should not be trusted for facts.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Apple is basically Mitt Romney.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fucking awesome analogy.</p>
<p>I like what I see, but a lot of it reminds me of a mashup of webOS/Meego/WP, but the nagging question is still dev/app support.</p>
<p>As a former Pre+ user, and also owning a TP (that hasn&#8217;t booted into webOS for months), webOS was my favorite mobile OS, but without apps, it basically died a premature death.  I&#8217;m not sure if RIM can do something better, while at the same time, fighting against the marketshare and mindshare that Android and Apple possess.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it as being as innovative as the original iPhone either, so that&#8217;s a strike again RIM IMO. Maybe if they come out with this a year or so ago&#8230;</p>
<p>BB10 can run Android apps.</p>
<p> So what, it&#8217;s not intuitive for the average consumer, and do you really think google is going to sit back and let RIM get all those apps free??? Even Nokia isn&#8217;t letting HTC or Samsung get apps the paid developers for immediately on windows phone, they have exclusive rights for a specific period of time</p>
<p>Dude, stop posting until you <strong>actually know</strong> what you&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m looking forward to the BB 10  QWERTY model,  I have to say I&#8217;m liking what I see of BB 10.  Bring on January.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s completely different and way better, but visually am I the only one who thinks the keyboard looks like Zune HD&#8217;s apparently horrible keyboard?</p>
<p>Implying the Zune HD has a bad keyboard. It was the precursor to the best smartphone software keyboard.</p>
<p>The unified messaging is a nice touch</p>
<p>dead on arrival.</p>
<p>People who think those swiping gestures are confusing, you should go bact to dumb phone imo</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what average consumers do! RIM will not suddenly infiltrate the corporate environment with this OS. I&#8217;m an IT manager, who makes the decision on what cell we use, and like HP this is not on my list of offering. Corporate has moved on. Verizon, ATT, Sprint, and even T-Mobile doesn&#8217;t even offer there corporate account BB units, they push Android and iphone. (if you want a blackberry device, you have to request it)</p>
<p>You&#8217;re an IT manager? That explains a lot.</p>
<p>Blackberry this is not your F@#$@#$ A GAME!!</p>
<p>Most of you complaining about the gestures obviously have never used a Playbook so dont realize how easy and simple they are to both learn and use once you do learn.</p>
<p>How about you guys stop trolling and actually demo a device.</p>
<p>Gestures are good but having a lot of gestures that are not intuitive enough can end up with a wild thumb dance.</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>Then again, there&#8217;s a five figured gesture on the iPad that takes you to the home screen&#8230;like the home button doesn&#8217;t exist.  There&#8217;s two sides to this gesture story&#8230;</p>
<p>I must say I&#8217;m not liking the changes RIM made to BB10. When it was originally revealed I got the impression that it would heavily emulate webOS. Now, not so much. Even so, there&#8217;s still quite a bit to like from what&#8217;s been revealed. And anyway it seems like only RIM has a flagship phone with a hardware keyboard in the works, so they might be the only viable choice for me going forward&#8230;</p>
<p>ugly</p>
<p>looks like Lumia rip off&#8230; Another sign that RIM is dying, a public, slow, death&#8230;</p>
<p>Read or watch, then comment.</p>
<p>It looks like a developer unit. Most of them are boxy and ugly like that. Very few developer boxes look like consumer products that follow them.</p>
<p>Like TI&#8217;s OMAP 5 developer unit:<br />
<a href="http://www.cnx-software.com/2012/01/14/texas-instruments-omap5-reference-design/" target="_blank">http://www.cnx-software.com/2012/01/14/texas-instruments-omap5-reference-design/</a></p>
<p>The makers of Crackberry are on crack&#8230; looks crappy</p>
<p>For a developer reference design, it actually looks kind of sexy.</p>
<p>Those things are like the 300lb gorilla&#8217;s of bikini models.</p>
<p>Active frames, really?</p>
<p>Look like a mashup of iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8. <br />
I don&#8217;t know what to think of it.</p>
<p>I do like the off-screen swipe to activate <del>-</del> I&#8217;m not sure if RIM has a patent on that, but I&#8217;d like to see that implemented as on option atleast on Android phones/tablets. I think it beats searching around for the power button which albeit is only a minor inconvenience.</p>
<p>Too much prior art for that.</p>
<p>Do you mean the Playbook? Yes it also had the gesture since 2010. But is made by RIM too&#8230;</p>
<p>And it is awesome on the playbook.</p>
<p>Hey, Don&#8217;t worry Android phones will have that, Because Google or Samsung will copy it, just matter of time</p>
<p>if you have to search for the power button on you phone, I don&#8217;t even know what to say&#8230;&#8230;.And when the software freezes, what are you going to do, pull he battery (primitive)</p>
<p>Looks interesting enough. The gestures look a bit unintuitive, but that&#8217;s the only major criticism I can come up with. Realistically, though, the Blackberry brand just has zero mindshare at this point. No one cares. Everyone has moved on. No matter how good this is, they&#8217;re going to have an EXTREMELY difficult time getting anyone to really take notice, let alone ditch their shiny new Android device/iPhone with established, extensive ecosystems. I&#8217;ll be pretty impressed if Microsoft can pull it off at this point&#8230; and I think they have a much better chance at doing so than RIM does.</p>
<p>Poor Blackberry will not understand what made them great in the first place.  Great keyboard, speed, and amazing email/messenger support.  They can survive if they would just stick to being the best phone for the corporate/government world.  Not everybody wants a touch screen and 1000 useless apps.</p>
<p>RIM will release a keyboard BB10 device too.</p>
<p>RIM is very much in tune with their strengths and what their customers want. They constantly talk about &#8220;BlackBerry people&#8221; and what they want in a device. They get it.</p>
<p>Move on guy, everyone else has!! Haven&#8217;t your heard, people in their 60&#8217;s, 70&#8217;s, and 80&#8217;s are using iphones and Androids. You are in the minority, and what does that spell&#8230;&#8230;&#8220;No Profits&#8221;. without major profits, their going down!</p>
<p>they&#8217;re<br />
their<br />
there</p>
<p>Blackberry by choice.</p>
<p>The ugly box is their way of making it Lumia</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the final hardware.</p>
<p>No, it is their final words&#8230;</p>
<p>To all the folk&#8217;s thinking this is a Meego/N9/Nokia knockoff with the swipe UI. The <strong>BlackBerry Playbook</strong> had the swipe UI long before Nokia used it on their N9.</p>
<p>It would be in fact correct to say that the <em>N9 was a rip-off of the PlayBook </em>in someways!</p>
<p>Everyone has ripped something off from someone else now. It is a wide spread and accepted practice. I support it, no reason your smartphone platform shouldn&#8217;t have a great feature just because someone else thought of it first. I do frown upon wholesale KIRF style copying though. Steal, but steal and make it your own.</p>
<p>Did anyone else notice this news sent their stocks up 4.7% since noon?</p>
<p>finally!!! something different. The mobile os&#8217;s are getting truly boring. Looks cool and actually snappy. Nice. Hope RIM does well. After a few years with IOS and now 6 months with android I will not mind trying out a blackberry. Anything with a keyboard?</p>
<p>Hey the Windows OS looks the best! But i still rather iOS</p>
<p>They will release also a BB10 device with a physical keyboard and a 720&#215;720 display.</p>
<p>Nothing special, nice to have a choice, wouldn&#8217;t buy it. People locked into blackberry because their friends are on bbm or business reasons will appreciate it.</p>
<p>I just saw a few other videos of bb10 and I am feeling this OS.  I hope they get the big APPS, I dont care about millions but the big ones.  Very nice!!!  Is it coming to the playbook?  those are 150 bucs now.  Cant believe I will consider a blackberry again.  Every single person I know that is not in government is using ios or android.  What a difference a day makes!  lol!</p>
<p>Yes, this will be coming to the playbook some time next year probably.</p>
<p>Apple was become lazy with iOS as of late and Android is getting better but as a Business tool RIM and Blackberry cant be beat. This is raising the bar for people who use their smart phone for work and not some fancy toy thing. So this is very interesting</p>
<p>I liked BlackBerry 10 better when it was called MeeGo</p>
<p>Stop parotting. The gestures, multitasking etc. where already in the Playbook long released before Meego in the N9.</p>
<p>Years late to market and this is what it looks like? Aesthetically it is not very attractive. Unless they really do launch with enough large title apps  then this is DOA.</p>
<p>Seems really unintuitive&#8230;</p>
<p>Love the quick access to the unified message center.  That might be enough to get me to consider BlackBerry again.</p>
<p>But it all boils down to quality, and right now the high quality of Apple&#8217;s software and hardware is simply unmatched.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true anymore&#8230; The quality of Apple in hardware is pretty nice although in my opinion is no longer the best&#8230; but the software doesn&#8217;t feel like the highest quality. At this point it seems boring and for some reason, I feel like the quality of iOS has actually decreased over time.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s just my opinion. Take it for what it&#8217;s worth. :)</p>
<p>THIS IS SHIT (in russian accent)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to bash RIM because I want them to do well but&#8230; let&#8217;s just say&#8230; WebOS still runs circles around this thing&#8230;<br />
Boy I wish they could make a comeback.</p>
<p>I have used WebOS and the Playbook as well as BB10 beta SDK on the Dev Alpha. WebOS sucked compared to BB10 in terms of snappines of the multitasking.</p>
<p>I have used the Playbook as well and it&#8217;s not as bad as some would make you believe. I have not used BB10 but I didn&#8217;t found WebOS to be bad at multitasking by any means. And I can tell you that WebOS was actually very snappy, the thing is that the hardware was slow, even on the TouchPad but if you tried any emulator, it was really snappy.<br />
 But I wasn&#8217;t talking about that aspect by itself, I was just referring to the general UI.</p>
<p>I really hope BB10 is great though! :P</p>
<p>After HP broke it&#8217;s legs, WebOS won&#8217;t be running anywhere for a while :)</p>
<p>Reminds me of my Nokia N9 to be honest. If you compare the two of them, you&#8217;ll find them quite similar. The N9 also has a quick shortcut bar that works the same as the messaging app. Oh well, but I&#8217;m talking about a dead platform here.</p>
<p>Its snappy!</p>
<p>Looks great. Hopefully in my hands soon.</p>
<p>Ummm.. I guess, I&#8217;ll wait for Gamma 1</p>
<p>Simple words are always the best:</p>
<p>RIM = RIP</p>
<p>Multitasking looks very quick. I like the personal and work mode feature too.</p>
<p>The most beautiful phone i&#8217;ve seen in years&#8230; and is a prototype to show an horrible operating system, instead to run Windows Phone.</p>
<p>SAD</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t have a chance to watch the video here at work, but I absolutely can not understand why the article does not mention Meego, seeing as the combination of live task switching on one homepage and notifications and feeds on the next was definitely done before.</p>
<p>You are wrong. Most of this was already in the Playbook OS and this got released long before the N9 was released with MeeGo. It could be argued that MeeGo was a rip-off of the Playbook OS.</p>
<p>Dude, could you just shut up or leave? I&#8217;m tire of hearing you say playbook. Since you&#8217;re so in love with the playbook, can you provide us with the latest sales figures??? That alone will end this discussion</p>
<p>Just like you are tired of hearing him, I and several others here are tired of reading your &#8220;light on facts&#8221; posts. But it&#8217;s your right to say it. I don&#8217;t have to read it just like you don&#8217;t have to read tw_&#8217;s enlightened commentary. Lady&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p>Preach tw&#8217;s preach!! These trolls hate the truth.   &quot;BlackBerry by choice &quot;</p>
<p>Also, the UI philosophies here aren&#8217;t really that similar to MeeGo. You get a pass because you didn&#8217;t watch the video, but it&#8217;s not really like MeeGo once you get pass the &#8220;oh, he did a swipe gesture there&#8221; first glance.</p>
<p>Looks bad IMO. At least they should have taken WebOS.</p>
<p>BB10 supports native apps which are way faster than the HTML5 / Javascript crap in WebOS. BB10 also supports the later but I don&#8217;t like their performance very much.</p>
<p>If this ends up being the final look and feel of the product when the product officially comes out, then they&#8217;ve wasted a lot of time.  I really hope they build on top of this beta.</p>
<p>It is a shame that most commenting can put some a negative vibe on anything except the device you own.  Seems like you just come here to talk negatively about something you don&#8217;t own.  I like all platforms but prefer my BlackBerry and I think this is awesome for BlackBerry users and RIM.  Thank you Verge for a good write up on what you have seen.  Not asking for a fanboy article.  Just state the facts.  Thank you again.  Oh, gestures on BB10 looks awesome.  Love it on my PlayBook.</p>
<p>amen!</p>
<p>You liking BB is fine, but do you honestly think that the average corporate user outside of the tech department along with a few savvy people are going to be willing to learn all of these gestures? Personally don&#8217;t like the way it functions (there are a few positives), but I thinks it&#8217;s suffering from gesture overload</p>
<p>Oh wow &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know BlackBerry was still around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m moderately excited about blackberry balance.  I describe my work blackberry as an &#8220;email &amp; phone machine&#8221;&#8212;it doesn&#8217;t function as a smart phone because my company does not allow me to install apps.  I only have company installed apps for maps and expense reporting.</p>
<p>As a result, I also carry around an HTC One X as my personal phone for everything I&#8217;m not allowed to do on my company BB.  Not sure I would give up my personal cell with this, but it would be nice if the brick on my belt did something other than email and phone.</p>
<p>And As a corporate IT Manager, the stance of not downloading apps, hacks, etc will continue to stand in the environment as it&#8217;s our jobs to protect corporate data.</p>
<p>IMO iOS should have had swipe up from the bottom to get task switcher from the start. Now if they implement it they&#8217;ll be accused of copying</p>
<p>No, because that is the home screen gesture, not the multitasking gesture. Also, the iPad does have gestures, so it&#8217;s not like they are copying that aspect either.</p>
<p>He only thing I miss from RIM is there clickable screen.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that SurePress is coming back, but I can see them integrating haptic feedback into their phone (like the Galaxy Nexus has).</p>
<p>But all phones have haptic feedback even my S3. Thanks for reminding me the name was Sure Press.  Epic innovation with that one.</p>
<p>So I just watched the video. I hate how this phone works. Horrible set up however the universal messaging home was a killer feature.</p>
<p>Thorsten Heinz is the man. That delivers on the sweetness that RIM has been cooking for months. BB10 will be the best mobile OS ever made and it will take years for Apple, Google, and Microsoft to catch up. Long live Blackberry and RIM!!!! Viva la Resistance!!!</p>
<p>Be sure to tip your waiters and waitresses, and try the veal.</p>
<p>I plan on buying a BB10 device when it is released, so as a fellow BB lover, I would like to discretely tell you your fanboy is showing. These other people were just going to let you walk all over the internet like that. I got your back bro.</p>
<p>Hideous. Looks like it was created in 2009</p>
<p>omg, Diester has 3 hands!! One is slightly tan too!!!</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m alone here, but I don&#8217;t want a unified messaging platform that integrates my email, FB, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. together. I LIKE them separate, because they generally have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>The hub looks like it separates them but puts them all in one place.  Making it so that you have to click in order to get into one.</p>
<p>to what end? like he said, they generally have nothing to do with each other.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty much my point. Why bother? They&#8217;re completely separate entities. I guess they aren&#8217;t for everybody though.</p>
<p>It is basically like this on current BB devices. The idea is that when &#8220;something&#8221; happens, there is a single place you go to see it. It works quite well for me on my blackberry now, I prefer it. It also fits in with RIM&#8217;s ideas behind this UI. If you are browsing the web, and you get a notification, you can swipe up then left to act on it no matter what it was. You don&#8217;t have to go to your twitter app, or facebook, or email, you just go to the unified inbox and deal with it then you are back in the browser. Done.</p>
<p>If I get an email while browsing the web, I click on the notification, and it takes me there. Done. If I get an FB message, I click on the notification, and it takes me there. Done. Again, I don&#8217;t really see the point. It&#8217;s really not hard to click on a notification, and yet it keeps everything isolated.</p>
<p>This usage paradigm isn&#8217;t for everyone, you may prefer something different but there is a design philosophy here. What happens if you don&#8217;t want to deal with that notification right now and you want to keep reading an awesome editorial on the verge? You dismiss it. If you want to check it later, where do you go? If you got an email, an fb message, and an IM, you are hunting through three apps to get all of your updates instead of going to one centralized place for everything that happened while you were reading the verge. Would you consider that a valid use? Not everyone thinks, &#8220;ok I want to do twitter now, ok now facebook, ok now email&#8221;. Sometimes it&#8217;s, &#8220;what is happening now, I want to respond to  whatever is happening&#8221;.</p>
<p>I should add that having a unified place to find everything doesn&#8217;t prevent each app from having a way to see notifications for that app in that app. It doesn&#8217;t prevent things from being separate if you want it like that.</p>
<p>I understand that this is subjective, but being a web forum I&#8217;m stating my opinion. Since it wasn&#8217;t followed by links of scholarly and/or scientific works, I was pretty sure that it&#8217;d be taken as opinion. ;)</p>
<p>No doubt. I&#8217;m just trying to give you some valid use cases. Thanks for keeping it civil.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it basically notification center, but with the ability to act on them. I like it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which platform notification center lives on, but yes it probably is much like that. It is also much like the unified inbox that exists on (and has existed on) current blackberry devices.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see their OS in action. If you have a Playbook &#8211; and in Canada you can find one for 129$ at TheSource &#8211; well you&#8217;re not so surprised with the gestures. No gesture is really natural per se; it&#8217;s simply a language &#8211; if I use the PB too much I feel less comfortable on the Nexus 7 when I come back to it &#8211; so what? Multitasking on the PB is nice and focus on most used apps and how they can display and operate is not something other businesses have focused on. Neither is work/personal use. Their &#8220;peek&#8221; feature and Universal communication app remind me a bit of the design of the mail app on the PB, or something like the Evernote app. I also remember the Scalada stuff for the camera, and Tom Tom for navigation and other content. This is shaping up to be something nice. If you&#8217;re into WebOS nostalgia, there are forums where you can contribute. But here you have a non US company building a new mobile OS using their expertise and it&#8217;s great. Looking forward to see the final product&#8230; and the hardware that goes with it.</p>
<p>Looks like the most boring os I have ever seen.</p>
<p>yes I prefer punch icon to go in, push button to go out, punch other icon to go in push button to go out, punch icon to go in, push button to go out, punch other icon to go in push button to go out, punch icon to go in, push button to go out, punch other icon to go in push button to go out,punch icon to go in, push button to go out, punch other icon to go in push button to go out,punch icon to go in, push button to go out, punch other icon to go in push button to go out.</p>
<p>Did you seriously just type all of that?</p>
<p>Yes he typed all that. He is obviously an iOS user, and since he typed all that he obviously hasn&#8217;t embraced cut an paste yet (seeing as it is a new feature an all). Give him time, he&#8217;ll get it.</p>
<p>Not bad. I like the &#8220;active tiles&#8221; idea. Going to be interesting to see how this OS changes between now and release. Used to be a big BlackBerry fan, so I&#8217;m still paying attention.</p>
<p>Yes. It is almost time to return to the fold. Move every zig. Make your time.</p>
<p>Well it seems to me that this is the only OS that is capable of running multiple Apps at the same time. Good bye to openning and closing Apps. I really wonder how people get a long with the iPhone and email. When I had one it was the worst year of my life for mobile email.</p>
<p>People here can crap all they want. This phone may fail but it&#8217;ll be because of the closed minds expressed on here and not because the OS isn&#8217;t good. Blackberrys are communication devices first and I see this as the best device out there for this purpose.</p>
<p>Of course Web OS was good to but failed so there are no guarantees, but it is handsdown a better OS than iPhone and Android well, it&#8217;s getting better but &#8230; Windows 8 looks to be the best, but I&#8217;m going to give this a try. I think I&#8217;ll be very happy despite what nerds on the verge say.</p>
<p>When I had a Blackberry it was the worst year of my life for email. I can&#8217;t possibly understand the infatuation with it, when iOS, Android, and WinPhone7 all do such a great job, work seamlessly with Exchange, and don&#8217;t require a BES to work well. <br />
The devices don&#8217;t last that long anymore; they used to be robust and durable, but now they&#8217;re crap. I replace them constantly. With the 4S now $99, and many Android phones coming in around that too, I just don&#8217;t see the point.</p>
<p>RIM should just give up at this point. No one wants this. A bunch of my friends had BBs and now own Androids with big screens. Some others are still holding onto their Bolds. I&#8217;ve spoken to them about this and they don&#8217;t want it because the only reason people buy BBs is for their keyboard which this doesn&#8217;t have. RIM have stated that they will be coming but BB10 is already late and those will be even later.</p>
<p>I want it. So I question your athoritative comment.</p>
<p>I want it too. Could be amazing by January. Definitely better than wp.</p>
<p>They are following their heart..stupid RIM.</p>
<p>When you make hyperbolic statements and absolutes it only takes <strong>one</strong> counter example to disprove it. You now have 3.<br />
Do you not pay attention at all? This a <strong>dev</strong> alpha device. This is not a consumer oriented device. The rumor is that there will be an L series phone (first being the London, which is the slate phone). Then there will be an N-series (first being the Nevada). The Nevada is a keyboard centric phone, a la Bold.</p>
<p>I also want it.  Haven&#8217;t decided if I will go with the full screen touch or the qwerty model.  The 9900 keyboard is so dreamy (if you haven&#8217;t used it you have nothing to say about it so just stop typing now) and a similar keyboard on a BB10 device is going to be double dreamy!</p>
<p>I find it humorous the disdain people express over something that is a beta device and is unfinished version meant for developers.  How about waiting until you see and use the final product before you make such strong judgments.  Reading these overly negative bias comments are irritating to say the least.</p>
<p>Y&#8217;all sound like a bunch of bitches needing a good slap to put you in your place.</p>
<p><img src="http://doinglifebeingtiff.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/bitch-slap.jpg" /></p>
<p>such a shame, really, because the underlying QNX RtP OS is beautiful and very good. Shame they put such a half-baked UI on top.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t beleive I need to state this nut it&#8217;s obviously a deve Aplha phone do you think they will put the final UI on it?????</p>
<p>I am afraid you have forgotten to realize that many have said the OS is already stable months before release. Adding to that, CEO Thornstien Heins said that he wanted to wait until it was perfect. Nothing is half-baked, nothing.</p>
<p>feels like 2009 again&#8230;..</p>
<p>UGH, it&#8217;s not the final UI</p>
<p>This is probably close to the final UI. I think it looks good. To each his own.</p>
<p>Looks pretty slick but also a little bare.</p>
<p>going thru the comments it looks like people just <strong>click on story</strong> <strong>looks at pics</strong> <strong>ignores write up</strong> <strong>goes and makes ignorant comment</strong> &#8230;lol @ ppl complaining about the gesture being too difficult, have smartphones made u dumb? I&#8217;m puzzled as to how this looks like android, iOS did not invent rows and columns. Other than that from what they showed today there is definitely advancements being made that will now force your phone manufacturer to do better <strong>cough</strong> iOS <strong>cough</strong>, and it cant possibly be outdated when it releases because iOS7 and the next android won&#8217;t be out before it.(majority of u don&#8217;t have JB and won&#8217;t get it unless you go purchase a new phone)</p>
<p>Did you type this comment on a Blackberry?</p>
<p>no i just didnt care for grammar this isnt school</p>
<p>Well when you type like a 12 year old girl it&#8217;s kind of hard to take your arguments of other people being ignorant and dumb seriously.</p>
<p>congrats to you, you used apostrophes and spelled all your words out&#8230;how many girl scout cookies do you want? you read it and understood it reply with some type of argument or keep it moving</p>

<p>Down-vote.</p>
<p>Thanks for the update on where blackberry 10 is going. It definitely has some interesting concepts. I really like gesture based UIs. I came from webOS to android and I&#8217;m really hoping part of Matias&#8217; next 2/3 deals with increasing the amount of <em>intuitive </em>gesture based UI elements. I like not having to rely on a hard button for unlocking. There seems to be a lot of complaints on phones 1 or 2 years in where the hard buttons stop registering.</p>
<p>The tiles seem like they might be a good idea if implemented well (their very reminiscent of webOS cards &#8211; iirc they were semi-live as well).</p>
<p>The app icons definitely seem a little dated. I&#8217;m hoping the next year or year and a half brings live icons to the fore. iOS could certainly use them to add info without being too annoying, Moto seems to have an interesting idea with their new layer &#8211; swipe up on an icon to reveal a widget, windows of course is going in that direction (although I&#8217;m not a fan of what they&#8217;re doing with white space or lack there of). I would really like to see android do more to support having the option for live icons or just better 1&#215;1 widgets I suppose (especially integration with folders). In any case, the squared off icons seem a bit too dated (although going the other extreme with Android&#8217;s make your icons whatever you want can seem disorganized at times (thank goodness for designers and icon packs)).</p>
<p>Unified messaging seems interesting. There&#8217;s an interesting discussion about content and hubs and dumb pipes and dumb data that I think needs to start happening with how we unify things (but perhaps not here).</p>
<p>All in all BB10 looks nice. I think one of the downsides though is that we&#8217;re not seeing anything too innovative to go along &#8211; they seem to have just modernized and smoothed out the os (perhaps the live apps might be a cool new ui, but doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything that might evolve a different ui paradigm, like voice might end up being or hubs or things like that).</p>
<p>In any case, a couple of questions: Is there a gesture for locking the phone or is there a hardkey for that? Is the a hardkey for unlocking the phone if you don&#8217;t want to use the slide approach? Also, are there any comments on the button and port layouts? If the alpha b device is really close to the L, perhaps the button and port layout would be inherited. Are the tiles really running or just in a frozen/informative state? Someone brought up power management issues for 8 apps running at once. Do you know if they poll or autoupdate in any sense? If you run a video, does it continue to run in the tile?</p>
<p>The &#8220;active frames&#8221; show what the developer wants you to weather its updating info or just a frozen screen. There is a lock button and i believe swipe down is to lock it, i know that is for bedside mode for sure, and they still haven&#8217;t shown all of their features are far as innovation goes, these things will just be relevant to developers</p>
<p>The frames sound interesting. I&#8217;m guessing they&#8217;d have to put limits on resources that the frames can call (i.e. you can&#8217;t have full app functionality in a mini frame). I wonder if they&#8217;ll allow for interfaces on the mini-frames (swipping for new content or dismissing things within the frame, perhaps playing a tomagotchi-esque mini-game within some other sort of RPG type game will minimized).</p>
<p>I was thinking swipe down would work, but from the article it seems they&#8217;ve reserved it for settings. I wonder if the swipe up means they have to power the digitizer or if there&#8217;s a capacitive stripe ala webOS to trigger up swipes.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a lot of potential, but I was also thinking that if they wanted to demonstrate a new UI mode (like aggregation of data or things like that), they&#8217;d have to reveal that to devs around now to get them going on app development. I&#8217;m not saying they need something new, but if they were going to do that, they&#8217;d have to let the devs know soon.</p>
<p>Oh, and thanks of course for replying and answering my questions! Bedside mode seems interesting.</p>
<p>Looks like it is, push lock button to lock or wait for a timeout. The didn&#8217;t show a lock gesture yet.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used the Dev Alpha B. Only the first Dev Alpha. But most of that appears to be similar to that and the Playbook OS on which BB10 is based.<br />
So:<br />
- hardkey: Dev Alpga / Playbook have also a hardkey for locking/unlocking<br />
- Tiles: These are apps. Apps can keep running or being frozen in the Playbook / Dev Alpha. The user can configure what he wants.<br />
- Power managment issue for real multitasking: there aren&#8217;t any. Apps are 99% of the time blocked waiting for user input or other events (like timer or network events) and do not consume CPU cycles. If they get a event they wake up instantenously.<br />
- On Dev Alpha / playbook the video keeps running in the tile if you configure apps to keep running when not having focus.</p>
<p>Thanks for further clarifying! I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re thinking hard about power versus use. I&#8217;m definitely interested in what happens early next year. I&#8217;m hoping at some point we can abstract UI from content. As they said on the vergecast, it seems really easy to build yourself into a lifestyle. And it&#8217;s probably in the os devs interest to do such, but it makes it really hard to try out different os&#8217;s while doing other things in life.</p>
<blockquote>The Hub sits to the <strong>right</strong> of the Active Frames homescreen — and indeed, the right of every screen. </blockquote>
<p>You mean left, Mr. Bohn?</p>
<p>Looks better then all those android skins out there.  I like it.</p>
<p>To be fair, this hands-on was pretty badly executed by Dieter Bohn. It&#8217;s pretty rare I&#8217;ll say this but the hands-on on Engadget is much better and shows the OS a lot better.</p>
<p>While watching that video review&#8230; That 3rd hand freak&#8217;d the hell out of me!!! WTF..!?!?</p>
<p>Nice  job RIM ..haters going hate that&#8217;s their job lol pathetic</p>
<p>God&#8217;s sake RIM, switch to Android or Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Looks great RIM! Can&#8217;t wait to see what the final version will feel and look like.</p>
<p>Microsoft, Nokia, and Apple sue RIM in 3&#8230;2&#8230;</p>
<p>Did anyone else automatically think of the scene from ghost when another persons hand reached over and touched the screen. We need a gif&#8230;.</p>
<p>If RIM made a car, I&#8217;d buy it&#8230;</p>
<p>Am I the only one that really likes that boxy &#8220;ugly&#8221; look it has going on? It&#8217;s classic, and different at the same time. Like a black pair of rayban wayfarers.</p>
<p>This UI and OS is <strong>based heavily</strong> on Nokia N9s <strong>Meego</strong>.</p>
<p>Boycott Flash!I cant honestly support the verge when I cant see your videos.</p>
<p>Does anyone honestly, hand-on-heart, believes this stands a chance?</p>
<p>Even if it was half-decent, and that&#8217;s unlikely, Microsoft want&#8217;s the number 3 spot. It will expend the necessary resources and pressure to ensure BB10 goes the way of WebOS and Meego, for the only reason to give it&#8217;s own OS a clear run.</p>
<p>I hand on heart believe it has a chance if they can get the OS out by january.  but every day they delay, that chance is going down.</p>
<p>I like it. This looks good. I hope they can succeed. Now we just need apps and good hardware (they might be able to fill the void of small flagship phones), though the former is not as important as the latter to me.</p>
<p>Nothing too special about it though I like the unified inbox. I&#8217;ve been wishing for one in stock android for years now.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, RIM have 200M fans in Indonesia.<br />
I&#8217;m sure they will profit.</p>
<p>Make it $300 unlocked and I am in.</p>
<p>Just waiting for RIM to sell out to Nokia.</p>
<p>that UI looks iOSish .. ba careful RIM, samsung paid 1 billion, you guys are fading just watch out,</p>
<p>Ehh, unless they have an app drawer that has different icons, they should be fine. Those icons are not rounded at all. Also, if this boxyness is any indication of final hardware, it also doesn&#8217;t have the rounded corners. They should be fine. Besides, the ui is pretty &#8220;innovative&#8221;, so to speak, so I don&#8217;t think they would fly off their rocker&#8230;</p>
<p>There is a lot of swiping going on. Looks fairly confusing to me but may just take some time getting used to it. Personally I am Android user but I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing BB getting back on its feet as more competition can only drive innovation despite what Apple might think</p>
<p>&#8220;What about actually using BlackBerry 10? It&#8217;s actually not bad at all&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Come on, try saying it: It&#8217;s good or really good.</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>
<p>Way to many swypes going on, it&#8217;s too confusing. Swipe up and then right for notification? Come on RIM&#8230;.. that&#8217;s awful.</p>
<p>Oh man, 3 gestures to remember. I don&#8217;t know how you can manage&#8230;</p>
<p>Can I ask, and this is a genuine question, why this article is not in the verge homscreen squares? seems like kind of big news here.</p>
<p>It was there for a while&#8230; on the day it was big news.</p>
<p>No thanks. Rim should have been on this a couple of years ago if they wanted to compete in the US. I rocked ios till the 3gs and since then it&#8217;s been all android for me. With the iphone 5 finally getting 4g and a bit of a larger screen i was debating on grabbing one as my secondary device but I&#8217;ve never been a BB fan and if there was another platform that I&#8217;d consider it would be WP8.</p>
<p>I think looks insansaly exciting. The smoothness and response looks amazing, looks way better that Android in terms of speed and render. I also dig the idea of the flow, the peek gesture is really innovative and not copying any platform at all. I See good things for this. More TAT!</p>
<p>Wow , unlike android, you can see true innovations , nice work RIM.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s complete bs. The phone looks pathetic.</p>
<p>This thing looks like if the lumia and zune hd had a baby&#8230;. I kinda like it</p>
<p>I think that looks really promising.<br />
I picked up a Playbook cheap in sales (£130) and I think its brilliant, the OS on that is very easy to use and I actually prefer that style of swipe and &#8216;running apps&#8217; to Android 2.2 (my phone) and 3.1 (old tablet).<br />
I will be after a new phone next spring, depending on the hardware, BB10 may well be a viable option.</p>
<p>I even quite like the simple Dev Hardware.</p>
<p>Hope BB10 will be better than ever.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d better bring their A-game.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d better bring their A++++ Super-PhD Ivy-League game with the amount of competition out there.</p>
<p>Like another article stated recently: it&#8217;s about the ecosystem, which is one reason WP8 is struggling to gain traction, and if they can provide a good ecosystem (i.e. android apps) then maybe they will be successful again.</p>
<p>They need to provide a whole lot of first party quality apps.</p>
<p>you know that &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; is not defined by the amount of apps. It is defined by apps as well as compatible hardware and services and i&#8217;m sorry WP8 has a top notch ecosystem even better than iOS. The only thing missing is the app count. I  miss some apps on wp8 but then again, i miss some other stuff on the iPhone like supporting freakin standard ports or nfc.</p>
<p>So this:<br />
<blockquote>it’s about the ecosystem, which is one reason WP8 is struggling to gain traction, and if they can provide a good ecosystem (i.e. android apps)</blockquote><br />
is bull. It is not that easy. Not for WP and not for Blackberry.</p>
<blockquote>&#8230;i’m sorry WP8 has a top notch ecosystem even better than iOS</blockquote>
<p>I strongly disagree.</p>
<p>Office+Office Web apps+SkyDrive vs. iWork+iCloud (MS)<br />
Windows=MacOSX (Tie)<br />
Azure+ ? (iCloud runs on Azure) (MS)<br />
Outlook/LiveMail vs. @Me/iCloud (MS)<br />
Skype+Messenger vs. Facetime (MS)<br />
Xbox vs. Apple TV (MS&#8212;Userbase)<br />
Kinect vs. ? (MS)<br />
Yammer+Lync vs. ? (MS)<br />
Zune vs iTunes music (Apple- only because it&#8217;s more established and popular)<br />
Accessories (Tie: Apple reset the game with lightning port and WPs accesories just got standardized)<br />
MS R&amp;D vs Apple&#8217;s R&amp;D (MS)<br />
Bing vs. ? (MS)</p>
<p>Disprove if you may.</p>
<p>1,Office coming to iOS<br />
2. Ok, MS provides a backbone service to iOS<br />
3.Don&#8217;t understand this. Both OS have email functionality, both have cloud storage.<br />
4. Skype is absolutely awful on WP, it can&#8217;t even run in the background properly. iOS has a fully functioning Skype, and it was already functional long before the MS buyout.<br />
5. Don&#8217;t understand why we&#8217;re discussing consoles now when this is about WP, and beyond that why we&#8217;re comparing an Xbox to Apple TV. Whilst I am aware Xbox have a lot of services (more than others if we&#8217;re talking smart TVs or Roku etc), you often have to double pay for them (XBLG sub + service sub)&#8230;poor idea.<br />
6. I didn&#8217;t know Kinect is compatible with WP, but sure &#8230; certainly not compatible with iOS!<br />
7.  I can give you this as I&#8217;m unaware of alternatives.<br />
8. Before I would&#8217;ve said tie, but the latest iTunes update finally made it more usable.<br />
9. I&#8217;m not sure, WP have a variety of devices of different form factors, how can accessories for them be standardised? I recognise Apple did screw over a lot of people on this, however.<br />
10. I can give you that.<br />
11. Google.</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
<p>Get with the times dude lol WP8 has full skype integration better than any non-MS platform will ever have (So good that even when Skype isn&#8217;t running you can still receive the calls and messages as if they were regular cell calls&#8212;a lot less battery consumption).</p>
<p>My argument is not about who has what really it&#8217;s about who has the better &#8220;what&#8221; with better features and options (Storage prices, free storage, compatibility etc). Also even if some of those services come to iOS etc, you can bet that they won&#8217;t be as fully integrated as they are in Windows Phone since MS doesn&#8217;t sell you ads as Google does Which explains their downpour of apps on iOS).</p>
<p>I do see what you&#8217;re saying though and good conversing.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m glad to hear WP8 has a proper Skype going for it now, I just remember the stories earlier this year about how on WP7 it was a bit of a half-measure.</p>
<p>You make it seem like Apple and Microsoft lock in their customers and they can only use their hardware and software, but in reality it&#8217;s the third party apps and hardware that make iOS stronger than WP8.</p>
<p><strong><em>For now</em></strong>. You do realize that Microsoft is the one that made this Team work makes the dream work mantra real? (Look at the Windows Desktop OS).</p>
<p>Hardware diversity ≠ ecosystem. Ecosystem is defined by these fine folks at The Verge as accessories + apps + services. The hardware diversity can actually fragment the ecosystem — not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but &#8220;freakin&#8221; standard ports and NFC don&#8217;t mean much unless you <em>can and do</em> actually do things with them. WP8 is great if you are already onboard with MSFT&#8217;s ecosystem. But the great things about iOS have less to do with what Apple is doing beyond hardware and more to do with the explosion in third-party apps and accessories.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you understand what &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; means. It&#8217;s not just apps, it&#8217;s the entire set of services, such as productivity, cloud storage, music, videos, other content, etc etc. In that respect, WP8 has a much more advanced ecosystem, like iOS and Android, and Amazon. BlackBerry has none of it. So, if WP8 with a well rounded ecosystem struggles, how much more will BlackBerry with no ecosystem.</p>
<p>FYI..Blackberry is a cloud based platform even before the cloud is called a Cloud, by far they have the worlds biggest private network that is lot more secured and faster. For cloud storage they are partnering with the likes of the industry such as dropbox, evernote by building services deep into the OS, also they bought their own cloud storage platform called newbay last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ecosystem&#8221; in tech is just another bs buzzword. What (non-brainwashed) people actually want is using the services they like and not being forced to be limited to a set of services because they are locked into some bs &#8220;ecosystem&#8221;.</p>
<p>Regardless of what you think of the word &#8220;ecosystem&#8221;, it is today&#8217;s reality in smartphone industry. In most cases, the solution provided by the platform vendor is the most integrated one, and in some cases the only option available.</p>
<p>Yes but it didn&#8217;t make WP successful yet to offer zune / xbox music. Most people care little about it if they are not already locked into it. They want to use the content they already own and the services they already have subscribed to because they like them.</p>
<p>So what I&#8217;m saying is that BB10 as a platform does not need to force people to use (for example) only a single source for music and video to become successful. In fact I think they should not trying to copy Apple.</p>
<p>They have a partner for content but people will look at the platform and check whether it allows an Amazon app, a Spotify app , a Netflix app etc. to coexist. So they can use the content providers they want to use. I think it will be much more important to get other content providers to support the platform than trying to copy Apple or Amazon or something.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re absolutely right &#8211; people like using the services they like, which is why iOS is so popular &#8211; services like Spotify, Rdio, DropBox, Evernote, Gmail, Google Maps, etc. work very well with iOS. How are those services working out for WP8? Do these &#8220;non-brainwashed&#8221; people you speak of enjoy being &#8220;forced to be limited to a set&#8221; of Windows services because developers have zero interest in the platform?</p>
<p>I have no idea why you seem to believe I&#8217;m in favor of WP8? Very strange. I don&#8217;t use WP8 and I&#8217;m certainly not a WP fanboy. Nor a iOS fanboy for that matter.</p>
<p>Welcome to Arguing With Fanboys 101.</p>
<p>First lesson: if you talk to a fanboy about a platform other than the one he is supporting, he will immediately view you as a fanboy of said platform, because those are the only terms he knows how to think in.</p>
<p>So if you talk to an iOS fanboy and tell him that you don&#8217;t think WP8 is as bad as he makes it sound, you can be nothing but a WP8 fanboy &#8211; because why else would you stick up for it, even if you do it in the very mildest of terms? If you then inform the fanboy that you don&#8217;t even use WP8 but use Android instead, well, then you&#8217;re just an Android fanboy using WP8 to fight your fight.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just politics. Go to your resident gun nut and ask him whether he thinks that children being gunned down at school should have any repercussions on policy. He&#8217;ll immediately label you as a bleeding-heart liberal pinko commie out to take away his freedom because of some accident that could have been prevented if all the teachers and students had been well-armed.</p>
<p>The underlying logic is this: &#8220;I am an extremist, so I will paint my view as centrist and normal, if not as an inevitable result of impeccable logic. When confronted with ANYTHING questioning my view, I will label whoever questions it an extremist in the loudest, most offended way possible, so that their opinion will automatically be dismissible as fringe rantings.&#8221;</p>
<p>It can be found in every walk of life and in any debatable issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing to this thread except your own sense of smug superiority. For the record, until your inflammatory comment, I didn&#8217;t think anyone was exhibiting &#8220;fanboy&#8221; behaviour. The poster above you seems to have &#8220;no idea&#8221; why I mentioned WP8 even though he was replying to a thread of several comments in which every single person was discussing WP8. In that context, his comment is the one that doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</p>
<p>And again, no one accused anyone of being a fanboy except you. My daily driver is a BlackBerry Bold 9900 so I&#8217;m no iOS &#8220;fanboy&#8221; either, but I recognize a superior ecosystem when I see one.</p>
<p>Yeah!! I don&#8217;t care if there are too many ecosystems already. I am so looking forward to it!! It&#8217;s always fascinating to see new interactions designs and new innovations coming around.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Not that I&#8217;ll buy it, but I&#8217;d like to see a BB10 BlackBerry Torch with the keyboard of the Bold 9900 and a 4 inch screen with 720p resolution and a 8MP camera and 2.0MP FFC. That would be legit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a WP user currently flirting with a BlackBerry Torch just to see how it compares and to write piece on it. What I can say thus far is that BB7 has a lot of potential and some really nifty features and reasonably good hardware. However the method of operation and many parts of the UI and UX are so archaic. They definitely need that BB10 makeover and they NEED REALLY GOOD APPS to make any headway. BB apps suck like no other. But I do like how it operates from a strictly business perspective.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not going to buy it, why should they make it? LOL</p>
<p>lol Good question. Maybe I might just for the fun of it :P</p>
<p>But I think others will is I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>
<p>Price it right and QWERTY diehards might buy some.</p>
<p>Sent from my HTC <strike>Arrive</strike> 7 Pro.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m already sold on the hardware. Just get the software right.</p>
<p>Seriously? That&#8217;s the most uninspired design. Place it with a bunch of Android phones, and you won&#8217;t know which one is that BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Its very distinguished from Andy phones</p>
<p>Hint: It&#8217;s the one that says blackberry on it <img src="http://i0.wp.com/boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/bb10-l-series-1.jpeg?w=618" /></p>
<p>why wouldn&#8217;t you want to put the Blackberry sticker on the top or bottom bezel, or someplace that doesn&#8217;t take up screen space? 4.2 inches isn&#8217;t very big, and you are wasting a lot of screen space on the bottom.</p>
<p>Two reasons:<br />
1st: BlackBerry 10 makes strong use of gestures and the top and bottom bezels are touch sensitive, too<br />
2st: This device is meant for powerusers and is meant to be controlled with one hand easily and fast. It&#8217;s a phone you&#8217;re not sitting on a train with watching films primarily, but one with which you&#8217;re rushing through the streets while typing in a hurry for example. With the big bezel at the bottom there isn&#8217;t any dead angle within which you can&#8217;t reach the screenarea with your thumb, like it is the case with the taskswitcher button on Android for example, when you&#8217;re using it one-handed. This phone isn&#8217;t in the spec race where bigger is better. It has its purpose and it&#8217;s all about usability.</p>
<p>Thought so. The logo is the only thing that distinguishes it :)</p>
<p>Really, I don&#8217;t know any Android phone out there which REALLY looks like this. There are similarities here and there (probably because todays phones are slates with big screens on the front and there were launched around 7,000 Android phones of this kind within the last 4 years), but this is very clean and the design is very even all around (like the iPhone). Androids have seams, logos and bulges all around.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait&#8230; I just reserved my BlackBerry 10 full touchscreen phone from Rogers. Getting it on launch day&#8230; good bye iPhone 5.</p>
<p>I wish I was as rich as you&#8230; :(</p>
<p>lol I&#8217;m not rich.. I&#8217;m just sick of iPhone and Android.</p>
<p>still a lot of money to blow on an iphone 5 and now a brand new blackberry on 3 months.</p>
<p>Well, you can sell an iPhone and recoup most of your investment.</p>
<p>You wont be when you get your new BB10 device.</p>
<p>I wouldnt do away your iPhone though :p</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been an iPhone user for some time, owning a 2G, 3G, 4 and now the iPhone 5, but I&#8217;m fed up with the call problems that I have experienced with all the iPhones, so I&#8217;m seriously thinking about the Blackberry L-Series phone and Blackberry 10.</p>
<p>Sure its not the network and your location? I live in a town AT&amp;T doesnt give a shit about and I barely ever drop a call.</p>
<p>Right decision here :-P</p>
<p>Launch events will be held in New York City, Toronto, London, Paris, Johannesburg and Dubai at the same time on Jan 30,</p>
<p>Will said fellow Leafs fan! Go Leafs Go once NHL lockout ends.</p>
<p>Really? They&#8217;re like 9 hours ahead in Dubai&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s doable. 9 am T.O. and NY, 2 pm London,  3pm Paris, Johannesburg 4 pm, Dubai 6 pm.</p>
<p>This is no insider info, just a hypothetical scenario.</p>
<p>Oh how I wish how I could be there in person, but I will be following online.  Looking forward to this event.</p>
<p>Looking forward to this!! I hope RIM can get back in the game with this device.</p>
<p>RIM might be on to something h…wait…is that Arial? Nevermind. <em>sigh</em></p>
<p>(Type has meaning. There are thousands of typefaces to choose from. Choosing Arial, which, rightly or wrongly, has become known as a poor man&#8217;s Helvetica, makes anything that uses that typeface in print or print-mimicking web images seem cheap and/or not thoughtfully designed. Expenses spared. This does not bode well.)</p>
<p>Arial and Helvetica have both been universally accepted as the best sans-serif fonts for reading. There&#8217;s a bit of reading on that poster. I don&#8217;t see this as a big deal.</p>
<p>Having those two fonts even in the same sentence is blasphemy.</p>
<p>Save for the &#8216;R&#8217;, I think there is little wrong with Arial as a typeface (I don&#8217;t really like the Helvetica &#8216;R&#8217; either). The problem is what it represents. As a designer, it tells me one of two things:</p>
<p>1) They don&#8217;t want to appeal to designers, they want to appeal to business types. They choose Arial over Helvetica because business people use Windows and that system actually renders Arial better than Helvetica. As someone who is keenly interested in the success of a QNX-based platform, this puts me off.</p>
<p>2) They are oblivious to the meaning of their font choice — which I deem more likely and more troubling. If they aren&#8217;t sweating the details, what&#8217;s the UX going to be like? My guess: death by a thousand papercuts. And good designers and devs will again stay away.</p>
<p>RIM needs to execute well. This is not executing well.</p>
<blockquote>RIM needs to execute well. This is not executing well.</blockquote>
<p>From what you write it appears to me that you have no clue what you are talking about with respect to BB10. Obviously you don&#8217;t even have read their new UI guidelines for BB10 which are available since August. Which would be of course no problem except if you want to make far reaching claims about BB10.</p>
<p>The font they recommend to developers in the UI is called Slate Pro:<br />
<a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/design/bb10/typography.html" target="_blank">https://developer.blackberry.com/design/bb10/typography.html</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether it matches your taste though. I guess not. But I like how it looks on my Dev Alpha. And yes I hope they are trying to appeal to business types.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great type — so why the fuck aren&#8217;t they using it in their branding!?</p>
<p>Because a poster /invite is not a UI obviously.<br />
Why did you post?</p>
<p>^Doesn&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>My post makes it pretty clear why I posted it. Did you read it?</p>
<p>And all the cool cats are calling it UX, because UI is just half the battle. Yes, good design is a battle — a battle that&#8217;s usually lost. I mean, look around you.</p>
<p>I went to a government office not too long ago and at the clerks window was a tiny formica shelf jutting out beneath it — just enough to write on a piece of paper. Above that shelf, taped to the backside of the window was this lovely note: <strong>PLEASE DO NOT LEAN ON THE SHELF. IT CANNOT SUPPORT THE WEIGHT.</strong> You see, rather than affixing two angled pieces of wood or other bracing into the studs holding up the dingy blue thing, every damned person gets assaulted by that offending message. This is unthoughtful design. It&#8217;s a microcosm for all that is wrong with the state and every other institution. And you and just about everybody else seem to think it doesn&#8217;t matter despite being mired in this same ineffable discontentment — which explains a lot about this far less than perfect world we live in.</p>
<p>Well, <em>I care.</em></p>
<p>No one here disputes that good design isn&#8217;t a priority. I&#8217;m ridiculing your perception that the typeface used for UI should mimic the one you use for press releases.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the kind of monotony I expect from students typing a research paper &#8211; its not something I, as a UX developer, would do or advice or even expect from anyone I work with.</p>
<p>…because &#8220;This does not bode well&#8221; is a far reaching claim.</p>
<p>Are you a woman?</p>
<p>Relevance?</p>
<p>Sorry it was ment as sort of a joke (apparently a bad one). I thought your proposed interpretations were a big stretch. I didn&#8217;t want to offend anybody.</p>
<p>Please leave the 20th century in the 20th century. I grew up in the heartland around racism and bigotry that persists to this day. Too. Close. To. Home.</p>
<p>You can make jokes at my expense without demeaning the fairer sex.*</p>
<p>*As described by Bertrand Wooster</p>
<p>To each his own, I like to be not always politically correct.</p>
<blockquote>I like to be not always politically correct.</blockquote>
<p>Translation: I don&#8217;t care if I&#8217;m offensive and I will use sexist or racist language in a public forum because I can.</p>
<p>Pff please&#8230; tell me you never told a joke based on some sort of political incorrectness or laughed at one.</p>
<p>What do you tell a woman with two black eyes?</p>
<p>Nothing you already told her twice.</p>

<p>Now <em>that&#8217;s</em> funny.</p>
<p>What if I were a woman? Does that suddenly invalidate everything I said? Are you a bigot?</p>
<p>And I should add, they are most definitely not the best for reading — their large x-height made them the best for reading as small sizes, which makes them a good choice for fine print and lower resolution displays. There is a really good reason that 99% of books are set in a serif (either directly or indirectly inspired by Claude Garamond).</p>
<p>Ha !  Yes, that is the problem with RIM. You solved it, it&#8217;s their font !!!   LOL.  PIcking on font?  And they say we need more to do with our lives&#8230;.   ;-)</p>
<p>Laugh it up, fuzzball. If you want quality and care, you look at the little things. Typefaces convey far more than just words.</p>
<p>BE BOLD: Use the most used typeface in computing based on the most used typeface. There are other great fonts that could convey that particular message far better than the Windows default sans.</p>
<p>Which font do you mean exactly? The headline or the subtext?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s Arial at all. RIM uses this font since years, it&#8217;s their corporate design. I don&#8217;t find it boring, it&#8217;s just simple and understating. Like the font Apple uses, only slightly different. I&#8217;m not a designer at all, I&#8217;m in the marketing industry and I do think this font has the right tonality and is fitting the BlackBerry brand and its value proposition perfectly.</p>
<p>Settle down. It&#8217;s not like RIM used Comic Sans or Zapfino.</p>
<p>Zaphino is an excellent script — not really suitable for this purpose, though I&#8217;d be less appalled.</p>
<p>Mark it down people. 30th of January the day amateur hour was over.</p>
<p>Yep, and it should do as well as the PlayBook did :)</p>
<p>Today I see the PlayBook as a BETA device, it was introduced 9 months after RIM bought QNX. NO ONE could&#8217;ve built up an entire new platform within this amount of time. As far as I can tell from leaks, BB10 hasn&#8217;t much to do with the PlayBook OS anymore, it&#8217;s MUCH more feature rich. Let&#8217;s just pick the file browser. Strictly speaking the one on one PlayBook wasn&#8217;t any, but the one on BB10 is feature complete. It can even zip and unzip archives natively. Just wait and see, I don&#8217;t expect any PlayBook-like phone story.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m sure BB fans are really excited that the day has finally arrived, I suspect that the rest of the world will only be watching out of morbid curiosity.</p>
<p>I wonder how RIM will measure success?  Since they have less than 2% of the current us smartphone market I guess there&#8217;s nowhere to go buy up.</p>
<p>4.2% actually, which ranks them fifth in terms of manufacturers, behind HTC 4.8%, Sony 5.1% and of course Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>That might be right in terms of hardware, but I&#8217;m talking OS, where they currently control 1.6% in the US.  <a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-27/rim-tumbles-after-blackberry-s-u-s-market-share-shrinks-to-1-6-.html" target="_blank">http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-27/rim-tumbles-after-blackberry-s-u-s-market-share-shrinks-to-1-6-.html</a></p>
<p>Either way though, it&#8217;s an uphill battle. Pass the popcorn!</p>
<p>They sell handsets, they don&#8217;t sell their OS. <br />
You said Smartphone market share, not OS market share.</p>
<p>Actually they sell both, but your point is taken. If they were producing android or wp handsets then hardware numbers would be more important, but they&#8217;re not gunning for HTC here, they want to compete with iOS and Android, and that&#8217;s not going to be easy.</p>
<p>You do also realize that the share was on sales and not the total market share it holds&#8230;</p>
<p>As RIM only realizes revenue on sales,  isn&#8217;t this the number that really matters? I&#8217;ll stipulate that it&#8217;s 1.6% share of current sales in the US &#8211; but since BB10 currently has 0%, this is where they have to compete.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care, take whatever number you want &#8211; 5% (a dropping like a stone) of total OS marketshare in US, 4% hardware sales &#8211; RIM has a lot of convincing to do.</p>
<p>Beyond some rabid fans, how on earth does RIM get the attention of buyers who have already committed to iOS or Android (and a few to WP)?</p>
<p>My original question remains &#8211; What constitutes success? How many units do they have to move in the next 12 moths to stay viable and sustain their ecosystem?</p>
<p>They Need 1% of sales. This is what Steve Jobs thought would be good enough for Apple.</p>
<p>RIM currently makes around 1 billion in SERVICES per quarter.</p>
<p>Whatever, what you don&#8217;t like to hear I think, is, that many people out there aren&#8217;t satisfied with iPhones and Androids like you are. Many people who left BlackBerry just didn&#8217;t want to be left behind in technology and are ready to come back, waiting for RIM to pull out a phone for which they can drop their amateur phones.</p>
<p>Only in the US.. Last I read RIM still hold 17% in Europe. Even with the aging products they still outsold Nokia Lumia&#8217;s&#8230; just recently iPhone was able to outsell BB in Canada. They still have a good chance. 80+ million userbase and for sure more to come with BB10!</p>
<p>The vast majority of those 80 million are dirt poor people in asia, who only buy crappy old Blackberry Curve&#8217;s for their insanely cheap calling plans. Most of them will not be upgrading, and will most likely switch to an even cheaper Android phone that is now proliferating in that market.</p>
<p>those &#8220;dirt poor people in Asia&#8221; actually helped save the company&#8230;</p>
<p>yeah while Asia&#8217;s economy is rising and US/Europe digging its hole :p<br />
you sure live in your mama&#8217;s garage</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10 isn&#8217;t a mass product like Android and iOS primarily. BlackBerry 10 has a unique value proposition and the target group they&#8217;re addressing accounts for ONE THIRD of the overall smartphone market. Obviously, you&#8217;re fitting the other two thirds. But well, not everyone on the planet is an Android user with a limited horizon like you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited for BB10, particularly for the gestures (I&#8217;m a webOS fan). I&#8217;ve been switching phones a lot lately, trying to find something that I like. I&#8217;m currently using a Galaxy S III, but I&#8217;m planning to switch to the L-Series when it comes out.</p>
<p>next year same time is the blackberry with Android on it launch event because this one will fail.</p>
<p>It already runs Android 2.3 apps in the form of the Android App player, allowing converted APKs to run as native applications. They will do fine</p>
<p>The keyword is &#8220;converted&#8221;. It&#8217;s not like you can browse Google Play from your BlackBerry. Developers have to bring their apps over, and they are not very keen. So the problem remains.</p>
<p>agreed, which explains why there aren&#8217;t hardly any Android apps that have been converted. Despite RIM&#8217;s exhaustive effort to demonstrate how easily they are to convert.</p>
<p>First thing is, you seem to have absolutely no clue about how many Android apps have been ported. They can&#8217;t be ported to the legacy BBOS and BB10 isn&#8217;t out yet.</p>
<p>Second, MOST IMPORTANT thing is, BlackBerry App World is 40% more profitable than Google Play (average revenue per app per month). So, you two, please tell me why developers souldn&#8217;t be keen to develop or port for BB10.</p>
<p>Nope the keyword is not converted but just repacked. You can even use an online tool from RIM to do that:<br />
<a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android/</a></p>
<p>The problem is only to make it more known to Android developers how easy it can be done. I&#8217;m sure most Android developers would invest a few minutes of their time to tap into a potential new market. The risk to lose much is very low for them.</p>
<p>The actual keyword is 2.3.</p>
<p>Most of the developers are aware of simple steps of repacking but most Apps are upgraded to work with latest version of Android which (some times) makes them incompatible with older version.</p>
<p>Nope. This is not the actual keyword.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where you get this from. But I&#8217;m a developer myself and thus I I know that according to Google more than 60% of Android devices in the hands of customers are still running Android 2.x or lower. Only 27.5% are running 4.0 and only 5.6% are running 4.1 or 4.2:</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html</a></p>
<p>This comes directly from Google. Since most developers try to reach the largest potential market this is the reason that most normal Apps in the Play Store are still supporting 2.x or at least still have a supported version which still runs on 2.&#215;. If you are a Android developer you should know that. So most current Android apps could be repacked easily to be able to be sold to BB customers in the BB App World.</p>
<p>Of course this will change slowly but RIM already said during the Jam events that they will keep updating the Android runtime and they will support the 4.x APIs.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a pretty good chance of something like this happening. How do they possibly gain mindshare in such a crowded market with a first gen smartphone OS?</p>
<p>Of course I&#8217;m not sure how well that approach has worked for Nokia . . .</p>
<p>So you find Android that great that you honestly think it can save RIM and BlackBerry? C&#8217;mon.</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t realize it but there is a massive problem with Android manufacturers. Only Samsung makes profit of it, all others are struggling on the ground. Why is this? It&#8217;s because each and every Android phone is nearly the same. OEMs try to differentiate themselves through crappy custom UXs, but that doesn&#8217;t work out. So they&#8217;re in an arms race and try to  overtrump each other with the latest top notch hardware. At the end the OEM with<br />
- the hardware that&#8217;s a little better<br />
- the biggest screen<br />
- an enormous economy of scale<br />
- the biggest marketing budget<br />
wins. And thats Samsung (-ONLY-) right now. This is so poor and so are the phones. And you really want to throw RIM into this basin full of (stupid) sharks? Not to mention RIMs business customers who count on their security.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/oG5Gk" target="new">The excitement is almost palpable</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just ready to see if they will make me leave Android&#8230;.. Doubt it tho.</p>
<p>So I guess they aren&#8217;t worried about the end of the world.</p>
<p>I really hope this works out for RIM&#8230; I&#8217;m super skeptical though. It&#8217;s just too late.</p>
<p>Agreed., it really is too late. How can they possibly hope to compete with their first gen smartphone OS? There&#8217;s no way it&#8217;s going to be as polished or complete as other players who have been evolving for 5 + years. Not to mention echo system.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really kinda a drag. I actually wanted things to work out for RIM.</p>
<p>Well, ALTHOUGH Android and iOS are around and evolving since 5+ years as you say, it turns out that BlackBerry 10, although it&#8217;s first gen, although it isn&#8217;t fully revealed yet, packs a handful features that aren&#8217;t on either iOS nor Android. It&#8217;s never too late when you have a good product.</p>
<p>Correction. RIM just posted that they meant 2014.</p>
<p>:P</p>
<p>Hahahaha, hahahaha, you&#8217;re so funny Mr Apple, hahahahahah&#8230;NOT.</p>
<p>Yep, it&#8217;s an obvious and not so clever joke, which is why I said it simply. Yep, it&#8217;s sad that it would illicit that response in you, because while it&#8217;s a simple joke, it&#8217;s also one based on loads of real mistakes by Rim.</p>
<p>I.E. you&#8217;re being too overly defensive. But such faith!</p>
<p>:P</p>
<p><img src="http://mobilesyrup.com/2012/12/17/images-beautiful-rederings-of-the-all-touch-blackberry-10-device/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mobilesyrup+%28mobilesyrup.com%29&utm_content=Google+International" /></p>
<p>oppa bb10 style！</p>
<p>It will be funny as hell if Apple, Google, and Microsoft make major announcements around this time! This will then totally overshadow RIM.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&#8217;d still find the BB announcement more interesting.</p>
<p>I guess this is the real reason they do it in January. It is unlikely we will see a iPhone 5S or S4 or Nexus 5 or WP Surface phone by the time. And few people care much about some other me-too Androids or WPs.</p>
<p>So this means someone will post something in the<strong> Blackberry Juicers </strong>forum now?</p>
<p>The thing really is that there are multiple platforms out there already. Obviously we&#8217;ll have to see whether RIM will be able to deliver something good or not and then we&#8217;ll have to see how it is received.</p>
<p>Make no mistake however, app developers have absolutely no interest in RIM succeeding. Heck, they don&#8217;t have much interest in W8 and WP8 succeeding. Some are slowly starting to adopt it and most are still &#8220;waiting and seeing&#8221;. Obviously something coming out with a big bang, stealing most users off another platform resulting in a (profitable) new platform will attract them, but this is horribly difficult to achieve at this point where most people are already sold into existing ecosystems.</p>
<p>And the reason is quite simple: No one really wants to support 5 different mobile platforms, having to use five sets of development tools, hardware features, sizes, requiring expertise in a truckload of different frameworks scattered around multiple languages and all those together come in various quality as well. Not even considering support and marketing costs exploding. And we already know how much more expensive supporting Android is in comparison to iOS, simply due to insane amounts of various devices, OS versions, manufacturer/carrier modifications and obviously problems related to the additional freedom and the possibility to screw something up.</p>
<p>Porting is simply tiring. We&#8217;ve actually seen this in the PC industry for many years and we only really had two &#8220;big&#8221; players here. So I&#8217;m really curious to see what will happen to the mobile platforms, however my guess is, we&#8217;ll have two major ones for the future, perhaps a third, less supported runner up (WP) and that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Transaction costs analysis is getting old. I personally don&#8217;t want to get out of my house and I want money to fall down on me as I write this &#8211; but in the end I&#8217;ll battle it against the world. It&#8217;s not up to devs or support staff or investors to decide where the market goes, they&#8217;ll simply have to follow the consumers where they go if they want to make (more) money. Of course there is no interest for expending money without some form of return. Then one can be cautious while others try to monetize.</p>
<p>Despite people feeling highly entrenched already in their solutions, this is still a nascent market, and one also has to look beyond the continental US. Pragmatism is required. As long as there&#8217;s value and innovation, there&#8217;s always a place, and there&#8217;s no need to be self-conscious about costs incurred by the market. People owning a share in this market not wanting to share it is a given.</p>
<p>So than it might help that BB10 can run unmodified Android apps?</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android</a></p>
<p>100% agree. As a developer I have no interest in supporting the 4th OS, as I am overwhelmed with the current 3 already. Supporting BlackBerry has been very expensive in the past 2 years, and the return was minimal. I am not going to repeat that mistake again.</p>
<p>Do you have an Android app?</p>
<p>Plus real devs should also know of the financial incentives RIM has put forward i.e. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2991956/rim-developers-10k-guarantee" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2991956/rim-developers-10k-guarantee</a></p>
<p>Plus, BlackBerry 10 IS NOT equal to the legacy BlackBerry OS. Everybody know how horrible developing for BlackBerry has been in the past, but well, as far as I know this has changed COMPLETELY. It&#8217;s easier, the tools are better and from a developer perspective, BlackBerry App World is less crowded and therefore you have less competition. Plus: BlackBerry App World is the most profitable platform out there (average revenue per app per month), 4% over iOS and 40% over Google Play. So, come on board and do it right.</p>
<p>So sad to see people developing for Google Play. Sure it has a big user base, but Android users don&#8217;t want to pay that much, 60% of Android apps are free, it&#8217;s highly fragmented (getting even worse with the upcoming 1080p displays) and users can test paid apps (not purchasing at the end) and there is piracy.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re a developer and also know about economics and especially economical behaviour, develop for BlackBerry 10. It&#8217;s the profitability under the bottom line that counts and not the total amount of users.</p>
<p>OMG! I hope it does as well as PlayBook did.</p>
<p>The phone looks like the backside of the iphone 5 and the leaked home screen is grids ?  going to be a winner here.</p>
<p>The design of this phone was chosen long before the iPhone 5 came up, so nobody cares about this.</p>
<p>Who the hell is RIM??</p>
<p>To bring you up to speed on what lead to current events, you might enjoy The Verge&#8217;s in depth <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/21/2789676/rim-blackberry-mike-lazaridis-jim-balsillie-lost-empire" target="new">article</a> from some time ago!</p>
<p>Do you know how to use google?</p>
<p>Redesigned &#8211; Reengineered &#8211; Reinvented. ..  but no Regain marketshare !!</p>
<p>I really want to see RIM succeed or at least do well enough to stay around, but I have a feeling there really isn&#8217;t room for a 4th mobile platform.</p>
<p>Its not that long ago that there were many more OS&#8217; in the marketplace and all of a sudden we&#8217;re going semi-Highlander and saying &#8220;there can only be&#8230;&#8221;?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s every chance that RIM won&#8217;t be the behemoth that it was 5 years ago, however as an earlier poster mentioned, its not hard to see RIM&#8217;s market share either go up for the next few years, or it dying by the end of 2013.</p>
<p>I hope RIM will still be around, because if WP, Android and iOS were my only options it really would take the joy out of the whole smartphone game.</p>
<p>I want a RIM job.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>I want a job <em>at</em> RIM. That&rsquo;s better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be content with either.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/2uQ76qrlK78/mqdefault.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>If both:</p>
<p>RIM job while at your job at RIM with Blackberry jelly (aka tossed salad)</p>
<p>The freak is real. .</p>
<p>Really excited for RIM, maybe I&rsquo;m being biased because I&rsquo;m going to receive an LE device, but it really does seem like they have a solid chance.</p>
<p>Yea I would say they will be the 3rd os. They already have a lead and these new devices will add to that. They have a very strong fan base also</p>
<p>I agree with both if you, I submitted my app on the weekend. And feel RIM has taking all the right steps to become the 3rd too os. Microsoft is still another story, they&#8217;re attempt to force the live tiles interface that failed last year with wp7 is a desperate move to become relevant. They will sell windows 8 products due to this approach, just don&#8217;t think the phone will do to we&#8217;ll as there old  windows mobile failed to take off for close to a decade, was full off issues and a nightmare to develop for.</p>
<p>What was your app? Just curious&hellip;</p>
<p>A weather app and blog/Vlog. From TRMG</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to see the new Blackberry phones that are coming.</p>
<p>The sentiment around Blackberry has really turned around&hellip; one of my friends who was on the fence until last month submitted 5 applications during the past 2 weeks, even I was encouraged to submit a couple of applications and this is first time I am doing any kind of mobile development. It was a pleasant experience overall since  it helped me sign up for vendor account, set up the environment and got educated on cascades and web works. finally I ventured into web works/html 5 app building, as far as development is concerned everything is seamless right from the sign up to submitting an app&hellip;Kudos to RIM&rsquo;s dev team for working around the clock (my vendor account got approved 3am PST and it got approved the same day I signed up)</p>
<p>Five apps built in a month? I&rsquo;m very interested at taking a peek at this launch lineup&rsquo;s quality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll be better then you expect</p>
<p>lol hell no.</p>
<p>Lol he&#8217;ll ya, especially better then windows phone.</p>
<p>Were you able to think ahead and tailor your apps for different screensizes? THe existance of a full keyboard phone is a nobrainer, but the lack of specks/screen resolution gives me the creeps&hellip;</p>
<p>They published specs &amp;screen res months ago &ndash; qwerty devices will be 720&times;720.</p>
<p>I really do want to see RIM succeed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing most of these apps are ported android apps&hellip;<br />
I guess the ability to easily port android apps (although their functionality might not work 100%) is their ace in their sleeves?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/tools/">repackaging</a> Android apps with  <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting.html">porting</a> them using the <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/develop/platform_choice/ndk.html">Native SDK</a> and choosing a development <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/develop/platform_choice/index.html">platform</a>.</p>
<p>I just hope this isn&#8217;t a money grab for developers. 15,000 apps are a lot and I just wonder if they are decent apps or they are just people trying to get the money and then not support their app.</p>
<p>They have to generate $1000 by themselves, be built using either Native tools, Webworks or Adobe Air to qualify along with further criteria to be approved as &ldquo;Built for BlackBerry&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As long as these apps are not the 400K that have never been downloaded on iOS, the users should be happy</p>
<p>The 400,000 isn&rsquo;t for ones that haven&rsquo;t been downloaded, it is for apps that aren&rsquo;t accessible without a keyword.</p>
<p>These apps have only been submitted and only approved apps qualify for the $100 they also offer.(20 app limit per developer, possibility of making up to $2000, on top of the, $10,000 if your app is native and qualifies as stated above me.</p>
<p>yeah&hellip; repackaging didn&rsquo;t work for our apps. We point for lot&rsquo;s of other of our own apps in the play market kind of cross promoting), and these links are kept after port.</p>
<p>So the first thing they have to do is cut $10,000 checks to all these developers (who simply ported their apps) as soon as BB10 launches? Sounds like they will be bleeding money if they stay true to their word.</p>
<p>No, they have to have submitted an app that meet some requirements to get the 10k. If they didn&rsquo;t they would go broke. I don&rsquo;t know what the requirements are though.</p>
<p>Those requirements should be astronomical for RIM&#8217;s sake. They don&#8217;t have too much cash to shell out like that.</p>
<p>Give me a call when RIM needs to blow their 2.7b in cash paying 2 million developers.</p>
<p>Especially since they wont have to pay these devs until after Feb 2014 lol</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of tough, and mandates native development.<br /><a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/documentation/overview/terms.html" target="_blank">https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/documentation/overview/terms.html</a></p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you go and simply read the source link and you&rsquo;d find the answers to your question: <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/commitment/" target="_blank">https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/commitment/</a></p>
<p>No the article conflates two completely different initiatives.<br />
They extended the deadline for apps passing built for bb in order to qualify for the 10k commitment .  The app must still have been submitted by 1/18.   They did this because of the massive number of BforBB requests they received.</p>
<p>Completely separately, they ported a TON of apps (19k) in the most recent portathon.  This is unrelated to the 10k commitment.   The portathon is a simple &ldquo;$100 per approved app&rdquo; buy that RIM is making, and is again not related to BforBB or the 10k commitment.</p>
<p>Article got its facts wrong.</p>
<p>If a lot of these are solid apps, then good for RIM and the BB10 users. If the store is going to be filled with a bunch of RSS readers and crap that a ton of devs threw together to hit a number than what&rsquo;s the point.</p>
<p>I think 99% of these apps will be half-assed ports of other apps.</p>
<p>If the developers are applying for the $10K they CANNOT be</p>
<p>I guess most are aiming for the $ 100 they get for just submitting any App that gets approved.</p>
<p>Even if 1% of are good it goes a long way.. for example a good RSS reader, a good torch light app, a good remote controller app, a DLNA client, a wall paper app, good kids apps of the 40000 submitted apps during these portathons..Also I think more importantly a lot of devs are signing up for the first and that is a good thing since if they see some kind of traction they will come back to build better apps, I think this is the inflection point for something to happen in-terms of apps for BB10</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>A lot of people are overlooking this.  ONce you take the first step of setting up a vendor account, that&rsquo;s a hurdle that&rsquo;s cleared and out of the way.</p>
<p>If the platform does well, we&rsquo;ll see many of these people &ndash; who registered just to make some easy money &ndash; returning to make apps that people will actually pay for.</p>
<p>Start with the 50-75 apps that need to be on every platform and then worry about hitting some number for numbers sake.</p>
<p>CMO came about to Fierce Wireless either the same week or the week after CES taht they have 90% of the top 600 iOS and Android apps in each region so&hellip;</p>
<p>Is there a list anywhere I can look at? I&rsquo;d be interested to see if that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t right now. Probably will be when it is officially announced.</p>
<p>Saving big names for launch</p>
<p>Well in my opinion it&rsquo;s a great marketing move to get the push of these devices out&hellip;eventually if native apps are not being made the platform will be in trouble but it looks great to release a product with far more apps than any of the other players have had at this point in time during the initial release</p>
<p>Will there be TheVerge app for BlackBerry 10? I&#8217;m going to be switching to a BlackBerry Z10 from my iPhone 5. Hopefully TheVerge will be there at launch.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t count on it. If it&rsquo;s not ios or android the Verge doesn&rsquo;t seem to pay attention.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Verge should really ramp up for the dozens of readers who will be joining the hundreds of others who will be lining up to buy bb10 devices . . .</p>
<p>What if someone entered &ldquo;TheVerge&rdquo; in the BB World search engine? Websites can be wrapped, at least.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll make a Blackberry app around the same time as a WP app.</p>
<p>Hopefully, both actually happen, too.</p>
<p>According to Tom Warren, there are no plans for a Windows Phone or Windows 8 Verge app. I imagine the same can be said for BB10 as well.</p>
<p>Exactly was my point.</p>
<p>It started as a semi-sarcastic point, but I followed it up saying I legitimately hope both actually do happen.</p>
<p>Same here and want the same.</p>
<p>I understand having some apps on multiple platforms. But news site apps? Come on, man. News apps offer minor convenience over mobile sites, and they are barely worth the development time even for the major platforms. Just use the mobile site or regular site. It&rsquo;s not <strong>that</strong> hard.</p>
<p>I prefer TheVerge app on my phone over the actual website. In saying that the HTML5 browser on BlackBerry 10 its the best in the business.</p>
<p>So how many of those are just repackaged android apps (with or without the consent of the original dev) in order to cash on those 100USD or which come from other android app stores?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/documentation/10kterms.html">terms and conditions</a> of the 10k commitment would disqualify scammers retroactively. Time will undo them.</p>
<p>In particular, when you look at what is required for app  <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/blackberryworld/preparing_your_app_for_blackberry_world.html">submissions</a>, then take into consideration the 10k requirement for the app to be <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/documentation/terms.html">Built for BB certified</a> then it becomes quite obvious that a simple repackaging of an Android app doesn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
<p>Also these are only apps submitted, only approved apps qualify for the $100</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually a bit sceptical about all this. RIM seems to have a bit of momentum right now and they are certainly trying to do their push, but my worries go beyond them. It is unfeasible to have to support 4 mobile platforms all coming with their own native SDKs, different programming languages in order to leverage the native SDKs, well that&rsquo;s tough.</p>
<p>So what I believe is going to happen here, is that we&rsquo;re seeing a lot of small developers going for the 10k, hoping their apps net them 1k by themselves. Note, that 10k for a solid, well made app doesn&rsquo;t even cover development costs. But still, I do see people going for this, since there will be some ROI if the app does decent.</p>
<p>Now, once this incentive is over, however, I don&rsquo;t see many developers supporting native BB10 apps. The reason is simple: BB10 won&rsquo;t race past iOS and Android anytime soon. Supporting yet another platform is a hassle, and since porting Android apps has been made so convenient and easy, my guess is we&rsquo;re mostly going to see ported Android apps on BB10 in a few months time.</p>
<p>Part if what your saying I&#8217;d true, but as a developer I don&#8217;t think that will be the case. It will come down to how bb10 does within it&#8217;s first few months if it sells millions of devices in the first few months people and develops will take notice, and if users are willing to spend on apps as be users have in the past(up until late 2011 early 2012, bbos7 was the 2nd most profitable is behind iOS) then developers continue to to support there apps, and if the ones who ported there android app see it doing good they may consider creating a native bb10 app, witch is but isn&#8217;t that hard if you already have a android version. RIM has 79 million users with claims that 70% are willing to upgrade, that and the amount of new users who switch or choose bb10 can also help in the decision to develop for bb or not, and I know a few people who won&#8217;t because they feel rim wont be around a year from now, which is far from the truth.</p>
<p>Not everyone will, but all they need are the top 100-600 apps on iOS and android, witch they claim they have 90% of. Only time will tell, but the bb z10 will be my main phone from launch as I sit my iPhone 5 in a box to collect dust. Lol</p>
<p>Sorry English is not first language, I try my best though</p>
<p>Better than many users on here, I&rsquo;d say.</p>
<p>Who says most developers have to support WP8 as the 3rd platform?</p>
<p>But I agree, neither of them will catch up to Android and iOS anytime soon, and they&rsquo;ll have to be content with the scraps and left-over development time they get from developers, and only from the bigger companies.</p>
<p>At least WP8 has some resemblance in it&rsquo;s development environment (APIs, Class Libraries, Concepts) with stuff many developers use exclusively. With the .Net development model they have lots of developers who are already able to develop for the platform &ndash; especially in the enterprise market.</p>
<p>So there are lots of developers who currently are not too likely to do iOS or Android development, but who currently don&rsquo;t do mobile development at all.</p>
<p>So if BBOS10 gets a lead on WP it will be most likely due to ported Android Apps in compatibility mode instead of in native developed Apps.</p>
<p>Raw numbers of users are one thing, but look at the profitability of the Apple App store vs the Android equivalent. It will depend on how much BB users are willing to spend on Apps for their devices more than anything, as long as they have a reasonably solid user base. I would guess that BB users would tend to be a similar demographic as Apple users, perhaps more business oriented though.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Seems like BB10 will even surpass WP8 soon in apps. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be funny?</p>
<p>There are like 150-200k WP8 apps. RIM will go bankrupt long before they surpass the 100k mark.</p>
<p>Eh? You realize they&rsquo;ve already officially announced a minimum of 70k. These portations will probably bump them over 100k.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m expecting a surprise announcement of either 100k or 125k on launch day.</p>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<p>Waiting for Jan 30. Wonder if they really has some news apart from the leaks.</p>
<p>I guess my Nexus 4 is in a league of its own.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your 3G, bro.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your <strong>LTE</strong>, bro.</p>
<p>There, I fixed it for you.</p>
<p>I thought LTE on the Nexus 4 only worked on Canada or something.</p>
<p>It works on Band 4 which T-Mobile and At&amp;t(rare) are using here in the US and many canadian carriers are using BAND 4.</p>
<p>Do you happen to know if there is any sort of map or list available of locations in the US where Band 4 is being used by AT&amp;T?  I&rsquo;d love to move to the N4 but holding off due to lack of LTE &ndash; but if it&rsquo;s available for the most part in my area I&rsquo;ll totally upgrade my GNex to the N4.</p>
<p>LTE is not officially supported and it&rsquo;s likely Google will disable the service menu hack that people are using to enable it in order to stay out of trouble with the FCC.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s officially supported. It works. Your hopeful wish that Google will cancel it with and upgrade is just that: a hater&#8217;s wish.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hope that happens at all.  I will probably be picking up a Nexus 4 on T-mobile in the next few months and I hope I can use it on LTE but I&rsquo;m do not think it&rsquo;s likely that I will be able to.  LTE cannot be advertised as a feature as the Nexus 4 anymore than jailbreak features on the iPhone can be touted as iPhone features.  They&rsquo;re both hacks that risk being broken by the phone maker with every update.</p>
<p>Sorry, but you&rsquo;re wrong. I can confirm that it works out of the box here in Canada. I&rsquo;ve gotten <span class="caps">LTE</span> speeds whenever I put in a Virgin sim card, which works on Bell&rsquo;s <span class="caps">LTE</span> network. No hack, jailbreak, or rooting required.</p>
<p>I never said it wouldn&rsquo;t work.  I said it&rsquo;s an unsupported feature that will likely be removed via software update.  The term hack can be used pretty broadly, but I&rsquo;d label dialing <strong>#</strong>#4636#<strong>#</strong> to get to a hidden diagnostic menu to be a hack.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your lack of <span class="caps">LTE</span> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6745/nexus-4-jdq39-422-ota-update-removes-unofficial-lte-on-band-4" target="_blank">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6745/nexus-4-jdq39-422-ota-update-removes-unofficial-lte-on-band-4</a></p>
<p>As a counter-point:  Sorry to hear about your paying $80+ per month for 2GB of LTE data, bro.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting ~18Mbps speeds on T-mo with my Nexus 4 for $30 a month, and NO Contract.  :D</p>
<p>I&#8217;m rocking with my iPhone and unlimited AT&amp;T data plan.</p>
<p>&quot; rocking&quot; is a poor choice of words. &#8220;tin can&#8221; feels more accurate.</p>
<p>Your being too harsh. I had a Nexus 4 it&#8217;s a very good phone. I went back to my iPhone 5 but I&#8217;m switching to BlackBerry Z10!</p>
<p>I hope you weren&rsquo;t using too many 3rd party apps on your iPhone and Nexus 4 because you will likely not be able to get them on the Z10.</p>
<p>What matters is how phone specs coordinate with the OS. even tho iPhone only has a gig of ram, it outperforms many phones with 2 gigs. How the z10 and q10 fare with their allotted ram remains to be seen</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s too bad BB10 is currently limited to running only 8 apps, seems that 2GB RAM isn&rsquo;t going to be fully used at least in that regard. But you&rsquo;re right, the OS needs to be optimized, and with no Java or dalvik VM  (which are the reason those 2GB RAM Android devices can&rsquo;t match iPhone with 1GB) slowing things down, BB10 should fare much better than Android does on the same hardware.</p>
<p>It actually can run more than 8 at a time from my understanding.  Only the last 8 used will be shown as active tiles with any others remaining open until RAM is all used up.  Therefore, if you have a 9th app open in the background and reopen it from the app drawer, it will open up right where you left off without having to reload everything like iPhone apps have to do.</p>
<p>Again, this is my understanding.  I won&rsquo;t guarantee this is the case, but its what I have read in the past.</p>
<p>My Galaxy Note 2 and it&rsquo;s 2 GB RAM can&rsquo;t match an iPhone; it easily bests it as there&rsquo;s no single app that has slowed it down. I&rsquo;ve even used the Multi-Window feature with Pop Up Browser open with each app running buttery smooth. The Dalvik VM doesn&rsquo;t bog down all Android devices.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly disappointed with the screen comparison. This section starts off by explaining that screens  are very important then looks only at the resolution, ratio and size of the screen. Higher resolutions (or dpi) do not make a better screen.</p>
<p>How about the viewing angles? The brightness? The colour reproduction? Contrast? White and black levels? Visibility outside the sun? I look forward to AnandTech&rsquo;s inevitable comprehensive review and comparison.</p>
<p>and the comparison for specs is wrong, iphone 5 doesn&rsquo;t have a HD screen nor 720p, it&rsquo;s 1136 &times; 640...</p>
<p>Good point, I tend to forget, that iP5 screen is great but also not HD, rather odd ratio.</p>
<p>Also, to me different of 30 dpi is not narrow. And I think Verge is glossing over here, they are using qualifiers:</p>
<p><strong>The Z10 display is 2nd only to the HTC DNA. For now.</strong> [soon to be M7 and Xperia Z etc.]</p>
<p>The article is appreciated but it doesn&rsquo;t really work all that well.</p>
<p>First it&rsquo;s still the good old &ldquo;checking the feature boxes&rdquo; exercise. Second even when a feature is known, the details make the all the difference. For instance when it was comparing the display, there is not a single mention of non-resolution aspects of displays such as color accuracy, brightness, viewing angle, thickness of the cover glass,etc. The same can be said for the camera as well to an extent even though there&rsquo;s a brief comment about its picture quality.</p>
<p>Finally it&rsquo;s very hard to convey the experience of a new OS vs the older ones even though the title says &ldquo;Blackberry 10 vs competition&rdquo;. As a VS. piece, it looks good but doesn&rsquo;t really work at all.</p>
<p>There really needs to be a &lsquo;browser&rsquo; comparison. Supposedly this is BB10&rsquo;s killer feature &ndash; a browser that actually works. Can we get a report on that?</p>
<p>Esto me emociona, que genial, se re-invento RIM (chiao) ahora BlackBerry, es un gran paso, un buen cambio y un aire nuevo para la industria. Hay que esperar ahora la reacci&oacute;n de los usuarios. Por mi parte me compro un BB10 cuando llegue a Costa Rica.</p>
<p>I honestly see here no competition at all. Sure, the BB10 will find it&rsquo;s fans, but seriously, it&rsquo;s simply a few years too late to make any great impact.</p>
<p>Said no serious parson in history ever! If that&#8217;s the state of mind Humans had we&#8217;d only use 2 brands of anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both next-gen BlackBerry devices utilize a dual-core TI OMAP 4470 chipset clocked at 1.5GHz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait what? Didn&rsquo;t I read somewhere it has an S4 Plus or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, I read that it has an S4 Plus</p>
<p>I understood that there are 3 variants of the Z10 (and presumably also the Q10), depending on the market (notably 3G/LTE/? [CDMA?]). I believe in line with this, some versions would have TI, others S4+</p>
<p>Correction &ndash; 4 models (based on HSPA/LTE + carrier frequencies). US/Canada Z10 are S4, international version is TI</p>
<p>For people who think 4"-4.3" screen is ideal, the display is kinda perfect.  But then they shoved into a big phone form factor (it&rsquo;s the same size as a Lumia 900, which is comparable to my Gnex with a 4.67" screen).  That is a fail.  I think they could have trimmed down the top and bottom section a lot more.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about the overall UX of BB10, but from the pictures and videos of the UI, it doesn&rsquo;t excite me as a potential convert.  I&rsquo;ll see if the in-person experience will be the same.</p>
<p>BB10 makes use of swipe gestures. To my understanding, some of those gestures require swiping from the edge of the display so there&rsquo;s some justification for the extra bezel.</p>
<p>If only z10 came out in 2008. But it&rsquo;s 2013&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;iOS has an unrivaled app catalog&rdquo;</p>
<p>really so they are thousands upon hundreds of thousands of app&rsquo;s ahead of Android&rsquo;s Google Play?   Last I heard they were neck and neck,  so hardly &ldquo;unrivaled&rdquo;.</p>
<p>and Android has  &ldquo;arguably&rdquo;  the more fresh  OS?    <br />
Oh no there is no &ldquo;arguing&rdquo; here.  It  DOES.   this isn&rsquo;t even a debate most apple fanboys will care to enter.<br />
iOS is flat out stale.</p>
<p>this site is rapidly becoming BGR and AllthingsD.</p>
<p>Well BGR is worst.</p>
<p>Please! BGR is a disgrace to the <i>entire</i> tech blogging community! People like him give Apple fanboys an awful name!</p>
<p>Are you okay?</p>
<p>Both are subjective opinions. Unfortunately you failed to realize that with the one you&#8217;re so adamant about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Android&rsquo;s &hellip; notification system still leads the class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do you figure? On AOSP there are no notifications on the lock screen (which means of course that you can&rsquo;t swipe on a notification to go directly to that message/call/etc.), the screen doesn&rsquo;t temporarily turn on to show a notification, notifications in the drawer can&rsquo;t be prioritized, there are no badges for icons&hellip;</p>
<p>Why do you want any of these things?  I don&rsquo;t think anything you have stated would be a boon.  I have a notification LED which changes color based on the type of notification I have, I would much rather that than have the screen turn on and waste battery every time I receive a notification.  Although GoSMS has just such a feature if you desire (I don&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Besides if I happen to miss the screen turning on, say on an iPhone how do I know if I have missed a notification? I have to turn on the phone and check.</p>
<p>I most definitely can swipe down my notification shade from my lock screen, although not if I have a secure lock screen.  However by definition if I have a secure lock screen I don&rsquo;t want notifications on my lock screen as anybody could then see them.</p>
<p>I have no idea why you want notifications prioritized or what &ldquo;badges&rdquo; are.  The expanded notifications in Jellybean 4.2 allow me to act directly on the notification, so I can reply, read and dismiss, or call directly from a text message in the notification shade.  The ease with which notifications can be interacted with is also excellent, no tapping tiny a &ldquo;x&rdquo; I can just swipe them away.</p>
<p>The iPhone can do sound or vibration based notification so you will see it when it pops up if you choose.</p>
<p>I thought that is the kind of notification used on the very first mobile phone?</p>
<p>You can access a notification on an insecure lockscreen plus there&rsquo;s notification lights and icons in the status bar. How is that not enough?</p>
<p>The North American version of the Z10 actually has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 MSM8960, while everywhere else in the world, it will have a TI OMAP</p>
<p>Source for this info???<br />
Seeing contradicting info from many stories from various sites, many are saying MSM8960, whilst many are also saying OMAP4470. It&rsquo;d be quite unfortunate if they&rsquo;ve gone with OAMP4470 only, doing it for NA only is bad enough.</p>
<p>There are <span class="caps">FOUR</span> variants of the Z10 (Lisbon/Laguna/Liverpool/London), depending on the market they&rsquo;re targeted.</p>
<p>The T-Mobile version for Germany (Liverpool I guess) has a Snapdragon S4 Plus and micro sdxc (64GB) support. At least <span class="caps">TWO</span> of the four variants have the s4 and a sdxc slot in them. The review unit CrackBerry got also supported 64GB sd cards&hellip;</p>
<p>I already sent an email to Chris Welch, but he didn&rsquo;t update the article yeat. Maybe he ignores it or wants to check on an official statement.</p>
<p>us.blackberry.com/smartphones/blackberry-z10/specifications.html</p>
<p>No processor specifications there, but at least it confirms 64 GB micro sd support.</p>
<p>Also:<br />
&ldquo;Battery life claims are for Model STL100-3&rdquo;&hellip;whatever that is (<span class="caps">OMAP</span> or S4)</p>
<p>Windows Phone/Nokia for the win.</p>
<p>My big question is how does it compare to windows phone? That&#8217;s where its main competition is for now I feel.</p>
<p>Should Microsoft be worried?</p>
<p>I’ve been using the iPhone 5 since launch in between last month I tried the Note 2. I’m going back to BlackBerry when the BlackBerry Z10 launches. I already pre-ordered mine. I can’t wait. Here are some reasons why I’m switching.<br />
Since 2007 iOS hasn’t changed much. I hate the locked down eco system everything has to go through iTunes. You can’t even transfer picture using Bluetooth. Even my 2002 Nokia was able to do that. Creating a beautiful industrial design phone that is prone scratches sucks. No point making a very thing phone that can’t be used without a case… Battery life that doesn’t last 5 hours of use. I know all phones have sucky battery life but the iPhone is the worst. Plus the battery cannot be swapped… But I’m getting used to the phone. iOS 6 is more refined than any other OS "currently" available including Windows phone 8 and Android. iOS UI is getting boring with the static icons but it works for the most part. I hate the "one button to rule everything" With the home button on iOS it has sooo many functions, one click to return home, double click to access app switching, triple click for accessibility, long press for Siri and from the lock screen double to click to access music settings. It’s just not intuitive at all. All in all as a phone I seem to prefer iPhone over Android. I wouldn’t have said that a year ago. Mostly because of the screen size, build quailty and the software keyboard is better on the iPhone with BlackBerry like feature especially word shortcuts which I use often. Also Android is fragmented, heats up, force closes too often. My iPhone 5’s days are numbered. Only 2 more days till launch of my next phone. iPhone needs a major UI overhaul if they want me to return as a customer. I’ll be happy with my BlackBerry 10 phone. Back To BlackBerry!</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>You are delusional.  Android and iOS are superior in every way to this phone.  Ecosystem, apps, hardware, specs, functionality.  Blackberry is DOA.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user, who was a fan droid before. And I&#8217;m also switching to this device it is far better then iOS, and it has everything I hate about android, security.</p>
<p>Every heard of personal preference? Ya that&#8217;s usually what determines the best device for someone.</p>

<p>One question:which hspa+does it have?21 or 42 ,if it&rsquo;s 21 it is a uselless brick,if it&rsquo;s 42 it will sell ton.nexus 4 was ignored here.but we should stop monkeying austrish.we all know why nexus 4 sale are low!they have million of customer in line at WalMart mobile and play all over the world people have been yelling to goigle and the manufacturer,just shut the duck up and take my darn money and give me my nexus 4 .google can&rsquo;t ,they don&rsquo;t have any.if they were to put n4in super enter there would be 0 n4.they can&rsquo;t supply them as quick as they fly off shelf (iingore manufacturer and google)the sad truth they can&rsquo;t keep up!why !hspa 42 is perfect decent speed and insane battery life paired with the <span class="caps">CPU</span> .it has a very good balance well see better maybe in tegra4 ,but why would google do that.me if I was google ?don&rsquo;t change anything <span class="caps">BUT</span>,add the lte booster in the nexus 4P,add more choice of skin .keep same red for smartphone ,its perfect!ya basicly they just need to <span class="caps">PIMP</span> <span class="caps">OUR</span> <span class="caps">RIDE</span>yep add the sexy in a nexus 4  make it smaller (I don&rsquo;t care about the thickness lol)and we have a winner !the only reason I use a Nokia 710 is because n4 can&rsquo;t be had,google e mail Gmail user they have n4and they re sold out before you can buy it .if manufacturer did ramp up production,nexus 4 is the phone everage people will grab ,it is the best compromise in all category.</p>
<p>Ps:I just stopped at Wilkes bare pa t-mobile store ,since last week they have the n4 cheer you would say ?mm 550$ vs same thing for 300 to 350 online?mm at that price blackberry won&rsquo;t be having hard time selling the new bb10 series.talk about a missed opportunity for t-mobile which as we know aren&rsquo;t Verizon or att!I could acced a  50$premium but 200$!nha I&rsquo;ll keep my old Nokia 710 eventually Nokia will update it ?or at least warn me an update is avail !if you can buy via play store tho n4 is a great deal.</p>
<p>Wait, is this the future?  Review a product before it&rsquo;s fully introduced?</p>
<p>it is called a review unit.</p>
<p>literal.com/youdidntgetthejoke</p>
<p>Hmm, you need to make those a bit more obvious.</p>
<p>All jokes aside.. this looks like a decent smartphone. It&rsquo;ll fit comfortably in 4th place near Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there is room for a fourth platform..</p>
<p>I just hope you dont have to take out the battery every 2 hours like every blackberry i&rsquo;ve ever owned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is room for a fourth platform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re correct. Blackberry and WP8 are in a death match. Two go in, one comes out.</p>
<p>I think there is room. You can be successful and not have a lot of market share.</p>
<p>This is a point a lot of people don&rsquo;t get.  If WP gets 10 &ndash; 15% of the market Nokia could be larger than it was in the late 2000&rsquo;s based on the number of headsets sold.</p>
<p>Windows Phone has had two years without <span class="caps">RIM</span> introducing any new phones and it&rsquo;s failed to get anywhere. You really think it&rsquo;s going to go anywhere now? Think again. <span class="caps">RIM</span> is selling more of its older legacy handsets than all combined Windows 8 phones.</p>
<p>To the person who asked about taking the battery out, no, you don&rsquo;t have to do this with BlackBerry 10. I would go as far as saying it&rsquo;s the most reliable OS out there.</p>
<p>Its been tough for WP but Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day.</p>
<p>Has Windows Phone 8 really been out for 2 years now?  Boy, time flies.</p>
<p>Two years on Windows Phone is sitting at 2.6%, it would be a long hard climb to 15%.</p>
<p>Well, in Italy Windows Phone is now at 13%.</p>
<p>Josh Topolsky&rsquo;s Biased review of Blackberry 10.  <span class="caps">ALL</span> negative opinions about insignificant issues about Blackberry 10.   When really the BB 10 OS outshines iOS and Android in multitasking capabilities.  not one mention about BB Hub and BB Balance and BB famed security.</p>
<p>You can just hear in his voice. Like he was forced to do the review. Companies shouldn&rsquo;t let him review their shit&hellip;. Save Apple.</p>
<p>Or flagship android phone</p>
<p>WP8?</p>
<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s rather successful in Europe overall. So it&rsquo;s definitely going somewhere. Also China. But no surprise most Americans are ignorant of what&rsquo;s going on elsewhere.</p>
<p>I hope Nokia just fizzles out completely.</p>
<p>How about profitable?</p>
<p>I think the difference is that was Blackberries punch for the year.  Nokia, WP8 OEMs will just keep punching throughout the year.  Nokia has an announcement in 25 days.  <span class="caps">HTC</span> a little later in February.  BB10 might be quickly forgotten.</p>
<p>Great point. Probably the most relevant argument posted yet. It is sort of a one and done isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Chevy, Ford, Toyota, Honda, <span class="caps">BMW</span>, etc. just like choosing cars, choice is good. So there is a room for 4th or even 5th platform.</p>
<p>Expecting developers to make apps for 4 or 5 platforms and the incarnations thereof (tablet, phone, PC) is absurd.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for the developers to decide. not you.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t room for 3.</p>
<p>You may be right, but I hope you&rsquo;re wrong.  That creates a phone OS duopoly, which is bad for consumers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s dependent on the type of market that&rsquo;s set up.</p>
<p>With this market, and this time period, it&rsquo;s very expensive to go into the market and stay afloat, simply due to people not constantly buying the product.</p>
<p>When you buy it, that&rsquo;s it, for 2 years. So when you gain momentum and become Apple or Samsung, and pair that with an average consumer, you&rsquo;ll get the market numbers which you see today.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the type of buying being done; if we all bought a phone every year, or half year, brand loyalty wouldnt&rsquo; matter as much, as you could easily switch phones when the next best thing came, and wouldn&rsquo;t feel bad about trying something new.</p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t going to go register a phone and switch after 30 days, unless that was their original intent.</p>
<p>Honestly, if companies urged people to come back after 25 days and sit down and <span class="caps">TALK</span> and get real info about it, people would be more open to try something new or be able to make an educated decision.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t increase the size of the company&rsquo;s wallet, so it doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>I do not understand why everyone persists in grouping Android together as a single platform. At times there is more competition between the various camps than iOS for example has offered.</p>
<p>Good thing they didn&#8217;t release it anytime before today.. I bet it would have been a disaster.</p>
<p>Looks better than windows 8.</p>
<p>Yes, static icons and non-intuitive gestures make BB10 &ldquo;look&rdquo; better than wp8. /s in case you didn&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Non-intuitive? Really? Have you even used one?</p>
<p>Well, he did read the review, in which the reviewer says the gestures are non-intuitive.  Pretty sure he even used that phrasing.</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Icons on WP8 are static too. If you mean the tiles then their equivalent are active frames.</p>
<p>Yea,</p>
<p>iPhone<br />
Other Android Phones<br />
Windows Phones<br />
Then BB respectively :p</p>
<p>two things wrong with your statement.</p>
<p>iPhone is second place.</p>
<p>iPhones do not run on android</p>
<p>iPhone is second place in what?<br />
- App sales? Nope. (Android sales of popular apps tend to be 10% of iPhone sales)<br />
- US sales? Nope. (VZW just sold 60%+ iPhones)<br />
- Web traffic? Nope.</p>
<p>Android has huge numbers but a large percentage of those come from cheap Android phones that are so limited that they&rsquo;re practically feature phones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Web traffic? Nope. bq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source?</p>
<p>Yes, because &ldquo;the world&rdquo; is approximately equal to &ldquo;the US&rdquo;. /s</p>
<p>Android is significantly more widespread and &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; outside of america. Third world / emerging countries, Asia, Europe, etc.</p>
<p>The iPhone may be big, but it&rsquo;s also expensive and has no concept of device scaling. That will be its downfall, just as software rules the roost in the PC industry and content rules the roost in the web industry.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an ugly American for ya. U.S. is the world, everyone else is just a character on tv, put there like the Truman Show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;large percentage of those come from cheap Android phones&rdquo;</p>
<p>50% of the those iPhones sold by Verizon were cheap iPhone 4S&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>

<p>And this article states that 95% of the Android devices sold are 4G enabled. How many &ldquo;feature phone&rdquo; android devices have 4G?</p>
<p>Is that including HSPA+ as 4G?</p>
<p>Cheaply subsidized but don&rsquo;t believe that they aren&rsquo;t costing Verizon a pretty penny. Why do you think V and att are trying to lessen their reliance on the iPhone? They&rsquo;re trying to lower the amount they have to subsidize phones.</p>
<p>wow i would still like to see a mid range android, because that is what 4s is now, that is as smooth and as responsive, and lets not talk about the camera, which is still one of the best on the market &hellip;. mid range androids come with shitty processors and even shittier cameras &hellip;.</p>
<p>In the US you can get a phone like the Optimus G or Galaxy S3 on contract for about the same price as a 4S if you look. And even other phones like the One X, or Lumia 920 are even cheaper. Outside the U.S. it&rsquo;s about the same on/off contract. Android&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mid range&rdquo; are free phones that compete with the 4, and anyone who can say the iPhone 4 beats the specs on the Xperia TL, Galaxy S2, or Windows Phone 8X is dumb as shit.</p>
<p>Yeah, that must be why Samsung is selling millions and millions of S2s and S3s.</p>
<p>android 70% market share</p>
<p>ios 20% market share</p>
<p>seems like second place to me. but hey, im only looking at the world market share. if you confine it to just one market you can pick wichever you like to get the result you want. so go ahead. ill stick with the world as a whole thanks.</p>
<p>and the iphone still doesnt run on android</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that the percentage of that Android marketshare thats a high end phone is very small compared to the iPhone though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m willing to bet that no matter what the % was of any set portion of any set market you would argue and change the goal posts until you found a winner.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say you win and state that the iphone has 100% market share (of the iphone market)</p>
<p>Considering most companies only report &ldquo;shipping&rdquo; numbers and not actual &ldquo;sales&rdquo;, nobody knows the real numbers. But because &ldquo;shipping&rdquo; numbers are larger and give an artificially inflated market share, they use those numbers.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right, these companies quoting &ldquo;shipping&rdquo; numbers and not &ldquo;sales&rdquo; are actually moving the goal posts first.</p>
<p>Please follow the comments.</p>
<p>Person a said iphone is in first place market share</p>
<p>I corrected to second, also iphone doesn&rsquo;t use android</p>
<p>Person b stated second in what and listed things nothing to do with market share</p>
<p>I corrected with the generally agred world market share rankings</p>
<p>Person c tried to claim victory by artificially separating the smartphone market</p>
<p>I stated that they are cutting the market up to be favorable to apple when the agreed facts state apple is world second in smartphone os</p>
<p>You chime in with a comment that all companies post shipping not sales so the data is invalid.</p>
<p>If that&rsquo;s the case then I will just claim wp is world number one. You can&rsquo;t prove me wrong. The numbers are all fake.</p>
<p>Seriously, what&rsquo;s wrong with you people. Are you so in love with apple that the very notion they play second fiddle in the world smartphone market makes you dismiss logic and agreed market facts?</p>
<p>You can use (!) to denote sarcasm/verbal irony.</p>
<p>The Daring Fireball review rated it a 4.5.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good start for such a new device.</p>
<p>More importantly it beats any thing from Windows phone and Bada.</p>
<p>No it doesn&rsquo;t. The People Hub and Me tile in Windows Phone do the same things that the Blackberry Hub does. the only thing even remotely interesting about this device was the screen sharing. The rest was nothing new or innovative.</p>
<p>Windows phone don&#8217;t even have a notification hub</p>
<p>Unless you count the home screen. The live tiles do the same job as a notification hub (at least they do with well written apps).</p>
<p>Delusion land is gorgeous place, right? What if I don&rsquo;t pin all of my apps to the homescreen? Not to mention is an unorganized mess that doesn&rsquo;t push tiles up if there&rsquo;s a notification, so in order to check my notifications I need to scroll the thing and checked manually, not to mention if I didn&rsquo;t pin the app there&rsquo;s no way for me to know if there&rsquo;s a notification.</p>
<p>Be honest- if there&rsquo;s an app you don&rsquo;t use enough to have on your home screen, chances are you don&rsquo;t give a damn about its notifications.</p>
<p>not true</p>
<p>Not true&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say that the vast majority of people use the same 10 apps the rest are just sitting their collecting dust. With WP more apps collect dust since alot are system level integrated, With Android you pretty much need a bunch of apps because you do not have this level of integration in the OS.</p>
<p>Ehm. No, that&rsquo;s just not true, is not even close to true. But even if it were true, it still would be a bad system, because I would still have to scroll and check the squares individually for signs of notifications.</p>
<p>Hell, I don&rsquo;t even unlock my Android device to check notifications.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not actually individually checking. Even if its a small icon, the numbers stand out pretty clearly on the flat background of the tile. Plus your five most important apps can display a number on the home screen.</p>
<p>I know that. But when I said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even unlock my device to check notifications&rdquo; I meant that quite literally. I see icons in the statusbar, I pull down the notification tray to really check my notifications (instead of just being notify that there are notifications), and sometimes if I wish to see more than a header I expand the notification. I dismiss them and go on with my life.</p>
<p>In WP you get 5 icons, you can&rsquo;t actually go directly to those notifications, or check anything about them, so you need to unlock your device, look for the corresponding tile, which pretty much lacks any information anyway, so you touch the tile, and you open the app, and then check it, and if you want to the second notification of your five&hellip; you have to go back to the homescreen, select another tile, enter another app, and then repeat the process until you&rsquo;ve checked all 5.</p>
<p>If you care enough for the data the app produces you WILL have it pinned to the screen. There&rsquo;s only SO much that you&rsquo;ll pay attention to or want to pay attention to at once. So stop regurgitating the nonsense you see here and use it for yourself like I do.</p>
<p>Not really. I can give you an example. On Android, I use an app called Songkick, that sends me a notification when a band that I like is coming to play in my city.</p>
<p>If Songkick was available on WP, I wouldn&rsquo;t have an alternative but to pin it to the homescreen &ndash; even if I don&rsquo;t use it actively and only get notifications from time to time.</p>
<p>So pin it farther down your homescreen and check it from time to time. It isn&rsquo;t rocket science.</p>
<p>If I don&rsquo;t pin an app, I don&rsquo;t want to get notification from it. There are plenty of apps from which I have no interest in getting notifications. For me, a notification hub would be a nice bonus, but not a necessity.</p>
<p>In android 4.2 you can say tell the system which apps you want to be able to send notifications. So, you have the notification center, but it will only notify you of things you care about.</p>
<p>Even iOS has this feature.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m with you that there obviously needs to be a notification center, and I think Microsoft agrees. But I must admit that I get far fewer notifications than I did on iOS. I guess the apps just don&rsquo;t send as many?</p>
<p>WP8 can display notifications three different ways:  1) On the home screen, 2) In a pop-up notification on the top of the device, and 3) On a live tile.  I&rsquo;m not sure how this is perceived as being inferior to its competition.  Furthermore, you don&rsquo;t need to pin an app to get home screen notifications or see pop-up messages.  IMO, it&rsquo;s about the same.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you haven&rsquo;t used a WP?</p>
<p>Ignore this comment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The live tiles do the same job as a notification hub</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is just plain inaccurate.</p>
<p>Major feature of the live tile is to NOTIFY you about the new content; therefore the start screen on a windows phone is basically a notification hub. It might not look like a notification hub to you, but the live tiles do notify you about the new content.</p>
<p>But seriously people, why do you always find something to argue about. This post is about Blackberry, not about Windows Phone, Android, or iOS.</p>
<p>..or the President.</p>
<p>The main difference is that I don&rsquo;t have to have an app on my home screen to have it notify me, and the notifications are kept in a list until I dismiss them.</p>
<p>Its true its not the same as android&rsquo;s notifications. Its not cluttered up with a bunch of useless info you don&rsquo;t care about.</p>
<p>If your Android notification area is cluttered with a bunch of useless info you don&rsquo;t care about, you aren&rsquo;t taking the time to set your app settings properly. It&rsquo;s just a difference of philosophy. Do you want to blacklist apps from giving notifications, or whitelist them? Do you want each notification to stay in a list until you acknowledge it, or do you just want to glance up and down your home screen and see whatever happens to be there?</p>
<p>Personally, if I have 10-20 apps that I want to receive notifications from, I don&rsquo;t want all of them to be in my home screen, so when I want to see whats going on I need to scroll down my home screen and look at each one to see if it&rsquo;s telling me something. I want to unlock my phone and immediately see every app that thinks it needs my attention, and deal with them accordingly. I care about nearly all the information that makes it into my Android notification area, and I don&rsquo;t see it as clutter.</p>
<p>Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but regardless, live tiles vs. notifications aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;the same&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When they work, which I found it&rsquo;s rarely. Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are particular bad at properly displaying notifications on Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is all too true.  The live tiles are very cool, but many of them do not update properly.  It took quite a few tries before I found a stock tracker app that had a live tile that works properly.  Windows Phone is stuck in this ugly middle ground right now where devs won&rsquo;t bother to make their apps better until more people are using it, and more people won&rsquo;t use it with the dearth of quality apps.</p>
<p>Man twitter on 7.5 is so haphazard. And I fucking hate the DM handling. Its stupid. I finally said it&hellip; Its really so bad though :(</p>
<p>I dunno. I&rsquo;ve found the &ldquo;Me&rdquo; hub does a pretty good job at displaying notifications from Facebook. Don&rsquo;t use Twitter or WhatsApp, but I&rsquo;d guess at least Twitter is similar to Facebook.</p>
<p>True. Honestly, when i had my Arrive I never missed a notification. Because all my important apps where on my home screen.</p>
<p>Why is MS planning to add a notification center to WP. Because live tiles are not a replacement for it. Toast messages are lost on WP too.</p>
<p>Twitter, Facebook(both MSG &amp; Notification), LinkedIn &amp; messenger alerts shows up in ME tile . BB added these things to BBM &amp; Mail and call it BB Hub.</p>
<p>but Windows Phone keeps Social &amp; mail notifications separate. which is better IMO.</p>
<p>btw, Contact management is best on Windows Phone.</p>
<p>P.S: I think Skype will be heavily integrated in Windows Phone.</p>
<p>You can keep them separately on BB10 too if you like. Contacts and calendar in BB10 are real business tools. The calendar in WP is awful.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>What about the gestures?</p>
<p>You really think gestures and the notification hub will save BB10?  They are direct rip-offs from WebOS and we seen how well WebOS turned out in their marketshare.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say that at all.</p>
<p>This analogy is total nonsense.</p>
<p>C&rsquo;mon RSGX are you being sarcastic? The gestures are cool and all but they don&rsquo;t add or make it a whole lot better than the way things are done now. Even Windows Phone&rsquo;s lockscreen can be dragged up slowly in a semi-BB way to mimic that drag up function.</p>
<p>No sarcasm.</p>
<p>Personally, I hate the design of the BB10 OS.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the only thing even remotely interesting about this device was the screen sharing. The rest was nothing new or innovative.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the gestures are a lot more innovative than anything that iOS, WP or Android offer.</p>
<p>You disagree?</p>
<p>The funny thing is the gesture might annoy people are make it interesting, but the way people rip W8 for its gestures BB10 will be a failure out the gate. Since it is pretty much said their is a learning curve to get used to and all the people say that is why they don&rsquo;t like W8 because of the learning curve.</p>
<p>W8 gestures are great, it&rsquo;s the interface that is a learning curve, especially when it comes to desktops.</p>
<p>Between the W8 and BB10 gestures, I think the W8 ones feel more intuitive. But more importantly, W8 will gain greater mindshare than BB10, so MS&rsquo;s brand of gestures will likely take root stronger. If WP adopts the same gestures (and MS absolutely need to level the metro experience across screens!), BB10&rsquo;s may be sidelined to RIMs detriment.</p>
<p>Overall I think RIM might have been better served with using Android instead, but the QNX baggage is just too much to let go of, I guess.</p>
<p>Nonsense. The basic gestures in BB10 are the same like in Playbook OS and you get used to them in 5 minutes. There is no &ldquo;learning curve&rdquo; to learn how to swipe up and down.</p>
<p>Swiping up, pausing, and swiping right is not something that even I as a techie would think to do to access notifications. It&rsquo;s not intuitive.</p>
<p>WP at least has text or images cut off on the right side to give a visual clue that there&rsquo;s more content to the right.</p>
<p>If the <span class="caps">LED</span> is blinking you have a new notifiction. <strong>Swipe up and hold</strong> and you can see which application that notification is from.  If you want to see more, <strong>continue to swipe to the right and hold</strong> and you can see who the e-mail is from, subject, tweet etc.  If you then want to read whatever that notification was for (eg the e-mail) <strong>continue the gesture to the right and release</strong> and you land in the hub.  The whole process takes less than a second and the whole concept is that you can do this at any time from anywhere in the OS running any appliction and it works the same &ndash; you get to &lsquo;peek&rsquo; into your notifications and the hub.</p>
<p>In terms of being intuitive, granted you probably need to be shown <em>once</em>, but how many things in life do you intuitively know how to do without ever being shown?  Double click the home button on iOS to access the task switcher?  Hardly obvious but most people know that&rsquo;s how you switch apps on an iPhone/iPad now.</p>
<p>Wrong. The way you describe it you make it sound complicated while in reality nothing could be more easy. It is clear that you have not tried it yet. I have.</p>
<p>Because if you are in the task manager or in the app drawer you just swipe to the right to get to straight to the hub. Swiping horizontally is intuitive.</p>
<p>Now if you are in an app you swipe up from the bottom get to the task manager.</p>
<p>So if you want go from the app directly to the hub you can combine it. You can do it in one move or pause when you just want to peek. And you don&rsquo;t have to make a right angle. Any curve will do.</p>
<p>If this is &ldquo;too complicated&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t have to use it. You can just use the normal swipes you just need two instead of one. Which is still much faster than holding the back button and waiting for  the task manager to appear on WP. Or pressing the home button to kind of &ldquo;restart&rdquo; the (already running) mail app from the tiles or the icons.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s like four gestures to know. Is it really that complicated to know? Seriously, maybe you should go back to a flip phone if you can&rsquo;t understand a few simple gestures.</p>
<p>Using Apple products really make you lazy, being honest, they don&rsquo;t make you think, yes they are easy to use, but when you throw something new at people, those synapses that are used to figure out stuff in the frontal lobe get weak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the gestures are a lot more innovative than anything that iOS, WP or Android offer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What innovation?  They ripped off gestures from WebOS.  They also stole the notification hub from WebOS too.  WebOS was even better with multitasking with cards.  I&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t steal that at the same time and call it innovative.</p>
<p>WebOS multitasking completly sucked compared with native QNX multitasking in BB10. Also BB10 is not based on HTML5 and Javascript. It uses native code (C++) and thus is much snappier than WebOS ever was.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he was arguing about the relative performance of the platforms.<br />
Also, what does the kernel have to do with multitasking? I don&rsquo;t know of a modern, multipurposekernel that doesn&rsquo;t allow multitasking.<br />
If you&rsquo;re bringing up QNX, I wouldn&rsquo;t mention it&rsquo;s multitasking capabilities but rather its fantastically consistent response times to interrupts.</p>
<p>Hey, at least they didn&rsquo;t rip off WebOS&rsquo;s fantastically awful buginess.</p>
<p>Really? You think BB10&rsquo;s gestures are THAT innovative? I can install a 3rd party launcher on my Android phone and have all sorts of gesture functionality for navigating my app drawer, home screen, showing/hiding the status bar.</p>
<p>Did you even see in the video above that swiping from the bottom result in something coming in on the screen from the right side? How does that make sense at all?<br />
I had high hopes that BB10 would at least be able to give WP8 a run for its money, but it can&rsquo;t even do that.<br />RIM obviously didn&rsquo;t learn much from their past mistakes.<br />
The only major improvement here is them finally using decent hardware, other than that, they are still just as behind and missing the target as they ever were.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about. No swiping from the bottom does not result in what you claimed.Just extend your attention span for a few more seconds.</p>
<p>I mean out of the box functionality that every user will have consistently across the BB10 range.</p>
<p>No it cannot when the display is turned off. You have to press the power button first. In BB10 you can swipe up when the display is off.</p>
<p>He might be, but swiping back out of an app or panel etc is nicer then reaching for the same back button. Its also nicer than a clicky home button. Even WebOS had a [capacitive] home button. BB10 with no dedicated buttons is new [unless you include the N9 ].</p>
<p>Hitting button requires more finesse than a bezel swipe from any place along the bezel. Can&rsquo;t really deny that. Some will love, some will not. <br />
Definately, WP does unlock with swipe up, but you gotta press the lock button too.</p>
<p>Exactly my point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed about the review.  Where&rsquo;s the security/management stuff?  Is that not the raison d&rsquo;etre of such a device?  Even consumers can care about security, you know.  Except Paul Miller.</p>
<p>i agree, i wouldve liked to see work vs play mode as well, both of these are what distinguishes blackberry. its still a business OS mostly anyway</p>
<p>No mention of BlackBerry Balance, BBM with video and screen sharing, Siri like feature, Integrated contacts app, Hub has a lot more functionality than described. All in all it&rsquo;s a half baked review. I was hoping for a separate and more complete review of BB10. But I guess they weren&rsquo;t looking to do it earlier but decided to go ahead with it at the last moment.</p>
<p>Yeah I think Josh missed point on how extensive the calendar and contact apps go, judging by the Playbook and BB10 videos. Oh well.</p>
<p>The Pocketnow review with the BB vs 920 by John something is a great review, I think he knows how to review, he acts like he doesn&rsquo;t like anything, he makes jabs at everything on his reviews. The Verge should take his class, because he could teach a course.</p>
<p>how can you say the way you navigate this device isn&rsquo;t new? It&rsquo;s completely different from the competition.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re funny</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it beats WP8.</p>
<p>However, what happened today is mostly enough to keep this company alive. Esp. with Canada release date of Feb 5th. Perhaps, US carriers are trying to bend RIM.</p>
<p>Completely agree with you. They&rsquo;ve brought the OS on par with rest and in some aspects is better than Android and iOS. They&rsquo;ll keep their Enterprise and consumer base for now and attract a few others.</p>
<p>They have me sold, now waiting for BB10 to hit my 64gb Playbook.</p>
<p>Bada I agree, 2 paper cups and a bit of string beats it.  But out of all the phone OS&rsquo;s I have used (and that&rsquo;s a lot) so far Windows Phone is my favorite, just a shame I am tied into a stupid iPhone contract.</p>
<p>lol. not even close.</p>
<p>this looks like a launcher out of the android market on a mid level android handset. except with less apps, short battery life, etc.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t get why it&rsquo;s fun to preach the end of tech companies&hellip; if you&rsquo;re not interested, why waste the time?</p>
<p>RIM is the only one who has severely wasted anyone&rsquo;s time, especially their own. This should have been out at least 2 years ago.</p>
<p>How did they waste your time?</p>
<p>Go ahead&hellip; tell us.</p>
<p>I guess dabug91 is still thinking about it.</p>
<p>Well think of it this way. 2 years ago there may not be a chip that can do what the z10 promises for the kind of price RIM is quoting&hellip;</p>
<p>You will write that same phrase about Apple in 1-2 years after they lanch iphone 6 (which look like the iphone 5 and all the others before)</p>
<p>What will you pay when you are wrong?</p>
<p>Yawn! The Creative Zen and the Zune tried to kill the ipod and then committed suicide themselves! Apple&rsquo;s been doing very well for more than a decade and they have over a $100 billion in cash just to sit on! These funny stories about Apple&rsquo;s demise are hilarious!</p>
<p>Why mess with good hardware design?  It&rsquo;s a slab of aluminum and glass and it gets out of the way of the software.  Personally I hope they don&rsquo;t change it.</p>
<p>People wrote RIM will die in year 3 years ago. Even the older BlackBerry OS sold more than Windows phone. It&rsquo;s not Bye Bye BlackBerry rather BlackBerry is Back Baby!</p>
<p>Good words!</p>
<p>That is very humorous.  Is that the same one from this time last year?  Good thing you kept it handy.  See if you can use it again next year.</p>
<p>Okay, that made me chuckle.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Bingo! Blackberry users now have no reason to switch to Windows Phone (if they ever did). BB10 will put even more hurt on WP8.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an ex-BlackBerry user and I jumped ship to Android cause i considered Windows Phone 8 to be a downgrade from <span class="caps">BBOS</span> 7.</p>
<p>Thank you for posting a comment regarding the device and not contributing to the diatribe of irrelevant nonsense from the posters prior to you.</p>
<p>Now back to our regularly scheduled program</p>
<p>As with any new device and software there will be some flaws. However, given these aspects, I feel that Blackberry has made a bold step towards embracing current and future trends along with preserving what a lot BB faithful love about their devices with regard to the Q10. To be fair, Josh&rsquo;s unit is a review unit and not a production unit. Hopefully the needed refinements were addressed. I&rsquo;m pretty excited with what they&rsquo;ve offered. I&rsquo;m inclined to try one out and compare it to what I have now and anything released in the near future.</p>
<p>blackberry fanboys score rants in &hellip;3&hellip;.2&hellip;.oh wait &hellip; those guys went extinct, dang it!</p>

<p>Calling your bluff.  I don&rsquo;t think that was a joke.</p>
<p>what  i dont agree it doesnt have a killer function to sway away from windows phone.</p>
<p>windows phone doesnt even have one of those.</p>
<p>BB10 have BB messenger and enterprise support which sadly still is best in market.</p>
<p>Ummmm&hellip; Never seen LOST? . . .  It&rsquo;s called a review unit.</p>
<p>I know this was a joke, but it gives everyone a great line in a few months if (when?) it fails: &ldquo;Critics were panning the device before the announcement was complete&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;It&rsquo;s not an iPhone,&rsquo; reviewers were overheard saying. &lsquo;How can RIM possibly compete without an Apple logo on their device.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good start for such a new device.</p>
<p>he&rsquo;s right, iphone doesn&rsquo;t even have a HD display!  this device looks better and doesn&rsquo;t have that iphone5 i&rsquo;m too tall and too narrow look.</p>
<p>Yes it is the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Until <strong>Research In Motion</strong> can answer that question, I would be careful about how you spend your money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(emphasis mine)</p>
<p>When was this article written?  Not a knock on Josh since he&rsquo;s probably had the device for a while (or a week) but i&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
<p>I think that phone is great. I agree about the &ldquo;only 8 apps&rdquo; thing. But as for just about everything else I&rsquo;m excited about.</p>
<p>That 8 apps thing is a bad case of the UI affecting functionality. I hear Sailfish will continue running apps even if the homescreen doesn&rsquo;t have the space for running apps anymore, though being a continuation of MeeGo, I guess multitasking isn&rsquo;t going to be a problem in Sailfish.</p>
<p>But yeah, that&rsquo;s the biggest issue I found with BB10, otherwise a good product.</p>
<p>2 things about the 8 apps.</p>
<p>1st: it&rsquo;s the QNX kernel. It works completely different than anything else on the market. Each of those 8 applications get their very own stack of memory and run completely independent from one another. So there has to be a limit to maintain stability and a proper ressource-management.<br />
2nd: There are 4 apps Active Frames on one screen, 2 screens in total. Any number of apps that exceeds 8, and opens a third or even fourth screen with 4 frames each, would get confusing. It&rsquo;s easy to remember and overview a total number of 8 apps, but 12 or 16 is just too much. You wouldn&rsquo;t be able to remember if an app is still open there, nor on which of the three or four screens it&rsquo;s located.</p>
<p>How often do you swipe more than once on your iPhone multitask bar? That&rsquo;s how often 8 apps is a problem&hellip;</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if you could keep apps up.  Like WebOs for example.</p>
<p>the qnx kernel isn&rsquo;t some magic pixie dust you seem to believe it to be.. other os&rsquo;s have process protection and run processes &ldquo;completely independent from one another&rdquo;(android runs them as separate users.. the 8 apps limit has <em>nothing</em> to do with that though. it&rsquo;s an ui design decision. though you wouldn&rsquo;t need to remember the overview &ndash; that&rsquo;s why the frames are there and not black boxes or a blind alt-tab history menu.</p>
<p>and maybe they should have just think of a better system for displaying running apps. it&rsquo;s better than wp though.</p>
<p>I think the corporate name change was the only thing the press didn&rsquo;t already know.</p>
<p>they always get the stuff earlier.</p>
<p>to the phone: it&rsquo;s cool, neat stuff&hellip; but iOS and WP are more attractive to me. I COULD however like BB10 more than Andriod, gotta test it first though.</p>
<p>I really like what they did, but like he says in the review, I dnt really see anything to make me switch either. If i was gonna give up my Galaxy S3 for anything it&#8217;d probably be a Windows Phone 8 device.</p>
<p>Embargos, bro. They&rsquo;ll have had this for at least a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Android apps I tested while using the Z10 performed abysmally on the phone.</strong> Sluggish, ugly, and disconnected from the core OS. In fact, because these apps are being run in a software emulation of Android they bear little to no relationship to the rest of the operating system. <strong>Even the tool you use to select text and the contextual menus are from another operating system!</strong></p>

<p>Android apps perform abysmally on Android phones too..lol</p>
<p>Try again.</p>
<p>Nice try.</p>
<p>no, it&rsquo;s normality<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>I could just imagine the doofs who brainstorm new directions for this company as a bunch of silver spooned MBA types prancing around asking things like &ldquo;How can we make BlackBerry hip for the young people?&rdquo;, or &ldquo;What kind of budget are we working with to build hype for our new product?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These people are utterly clueless. You can usually pick up on the quality of a product and it&rsquo;s intended market by how hard a company tries to appeal to EVERY segment. This is why I admire Apple&rsquo;s tasteful liberal ambiguity &mdash; everybody can be an artist, and a fabulous one at that!</p>
<p>RIM/BlackBerry is such an uninspired company. They are just unable to understand the market.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;ll see how their products work out. I&rsquo;m just commenting on their tasteless hype.</p>
<p>They totally understand their market. They explained their target user in their launch presentation. It&rsquo;s a company full of engineers. Clearly they are more focused and better executing then they have been in years. I don&rsquo;t get the vibe that a bunch of MBA types are running around trying to hip up the product with the latest buzzword worthy tech.</p>
<p>Then what was all the hub bub about Alicia Keys?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Errr what?  How demographically ambiguous is the iPhone advert about having a separate microphone to detect and cancel out background noise?</p>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s marketing message consist of we-know-you-already-want-it-because-well-it&rsquo;s-an-iPhone-isn&rsquo;t-it and patronising descriptions of features that hardly differeniate them from the competition.  &lsquo;Our earbuds are not round because ears are not round&rsquo;.  Then why the hell were you selling round earbuds for 11 years?!</p>
<p>That being said I&rsquo;m sure <del><span class="caps">RIM</span></del> BlackBerry&rsquo;s Super Bowl commercial will be cringeworthy.</p>
<p>The browser is the only mobile browser that supports Flash!!!</p>
<p>I run flash on my Nexus 7???</p>
<p>Even Adobe doesn&rsquo;t develop flash for mobile anymore!</p>
<p>correction:  even Adobe doesn&rsquo;t support the Flash plugin for mobile web browsers anymore.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s deja vu.  That looks like the Motorola droid x running froyo&#8230;</p>
<p>Are you aware that this phone is being released today in Europe? And that this is a &ldquo;review&rdquo; unit?</p>
<p>Why would Blackberry give Topolsky a phone that wasn&rsquo;t finalized hardware and to be used as a judgment of phones they&rsquo;re selling in stores? Why would they give <strong>worse</strong> units out for the tech press to rate and write about? Drop that talking point.</p>
<p>Totally agree with your suggestion.. Very nice post and good information here..Thanks for posting that.. <a href="http://med-sciences.com/">Read</a></p>
<p>Nothing special, but at least less of a reason to laugh at phone who own this blackberry phone as it was in the past with ALL blackberry phones.</p>
<p>This almost sense makes.</p>
<p>How old are you? The Torch is the point where BBs became a joke. Before that they were the defacto business brand.</p>
<p>Blackberry 10 has the same ecosystem as WP8? Cue the Lumia crowd! (I own a Lumia though, but my fanboy loyalties lies in Symbian)</p>
<p>PS, I always viewed BB10 with interest, switching from Symbian. But goddamnit, the multitasking still doesn&rsquo;t work intuitively? Is there seriously nothing with better multitasking than WebOS and Symbian?</p>
<p>Maemo?</p>
<p>Touchwiz Android?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an attack on Android, it&rsquo;s an attack on a skin that runs on top of Android.</p>
<p>An attack on a skin whose latest iteration is by far better than stock Android? Seems like you&#8217;ve used it never.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this was said.</p>
<p>You should believe it was said.  It&rsquo;s better.  Google is copying Samsung at this point.</p>
<p>Not sure if high, or just stupid.</p>
<p>Intelligent, actually.  TouchWiz is better than stock.  Get over your problem with facts.</p>
<p>TouchWiz:<br />
-Has better camera software, more robust options, burst shooting<br />
-Has a better gallery, with different view types, video previews, etc<br />
-has Facebook contact integration out of the box, no need for lame HaxSync<br />
-has Multi-window view, stock does not have this at all<br />
-has a T9 dialer&hellip; sounds minimal, huge improvement<br />
-has Smart Stay&hellip; sounds gimmicky, works flawlessly<br />
-has Smart Rotate&hellip; sounds gimmicky, again works flawlessly<br />
-has a Contact list integrated to the phone app instead of a random ugly white backkground app that is out of touch with the rest of the UI<br />
-has S-Beam, which blows away standard Android Beam&hellip; which it also has&hellip; it also makes <span class="caps">NFC</span> file transfers actually useful.<br />
-has an overall UI feel that is cohesive, instead of disjointed<br />
-has minor accessibility improvements that narrow steps needed to perform simple mundane tasks&hellip; ie, toggles in the notification panel<br />
-has a Calendar app that is second-to-none.</p>
<p>&hellip;it really is no comparison.  TouchWiz is better&hellip; by miles.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t be serious. Touchwiz&rsquo;s multitasking is just Android multitasking plus a button that links to an unnecessary and user-unfriendly task manager.</p>
<p>I guess you&rsquo;ll have to wait for Jolla.</p>
<p>It ain&rsquo;t jolla till the fat lady sings JOLLA!!!!</p>
<p>You mean Sailfish OS? Jolla is the company</p>

<p>Hah, good question. Leaving Symbian for Android, multitasking is one thing I really miss. The ability to run so many apps without fear of them getting killed, everything allowed to run if it needs to, etc, and without much hit on battery. Was just so good on Symbian.</p>
<p>That, and alarms that still work when the phone is turned off. Seriously, Symbian had some awesome features that are still unparallelled by &ldquo;modern&rdquo; OSes&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, these modern OSes also leave out some basic features, perhaps thanks to the mantra of &ldquo;there&rsquo;s an app for that&rdquo;. Symbian can&rsquo;t be beat it seems in these matters, though Symbian did have years of development behind it.</p>
<p>Oh come on. Even on iPhones nowadays alarms work when the phone is off (and/or on another app).</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re not quite understanding what he&rsquo;s saying. He&rsquo;s saying Symbian&rsquo;s alarm will work when the phone is fully powered off, not if the screen is off. The iPhone (nor any other smartphone) will not trigger alarms if the phone is off without booting the OS first.</p>
<p>Some android phones (not all) do turn on for an alarm.</p>
<p>thats the phone though not the os.</p>
<p>Same thing with Symbian based devices, it was the hardware not the OS.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a combination of both. The OS has to support it and the phone has to have the hardware for it.</p>
<p>Exactly. Symbian devices would even save just enough battery power so they could still trigger the alarm even when the battery is dead. I&rsquo;ve had my Android die over night and then oversleep in the morning. This never was a problem with my Nokia 5530. Archaic UI and OS architecture? Sure. But extremely robust.</p>
<p>Ah ok. Didn&rsquo;t get that no. Wouldn&rsquo;t see the point of it either though.</p>
<p>Lets say you forgot your charger and are crashing at a friends house after a night of partying, you can turn your phone off and not worry about missing your alarm. I know I&rsquo;ve had to airplane mode my phone in last minute situations and even then it still uses some power.</p>
<p>And I find this to be a ridiculous &lsquo;feature&rsquo;. If I go to the trouble of turning my phone off, I want to make sure its OFF, I dont expect to continue getting notifications.</p>
<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t get any other notifications. If you set an alarm on a Symbian device and turn the phone off, it will still trigger the alarm at the right time and will ask whether you want to turn on the phone. I think S40 devices also do this.</p>
<p>Would still somehow work, even if the battery had run flat.</p>
<p>True, I had Nokia E71 prior to Galaxy Note II ( Yes the Note II is my first &ldquo;proper&rdquo; smartphone ) and I missed my phone waking me up in the morning even when the battery is dead. It saved enough battery just to wake you up</p>
<p>Basically the functionality on those devices sits in the Bootloader which is why it doesn&rsquo;t need too much power for it. It&rsquo;s simply not running the whole OS, etc.</p>
<p>Alarms != Notifications &hellip; I don&rsquo;t understand people sometimes, who turns down more features?</p>
<p>Old BBOS devices would power the phone up from standby mode to trigger an alarm.</p>
<p>My current BB from 3 years ago will trigger the alarm when fully turned off.</p>
<p>I could be wrong but AFAIK the alarm on an iPhone does not work when you turn the phone off.</p>
<p>I think he intended &ldquo;off&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;on standby&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And the kernel had some serious limitations due to the ingenuity of those features. <br />
Diamonds at the bottom of the sewer.</p>
<p>Yup, even when the battery goes flat at night, it reserves enough power to run the alarm. (S60)</p>
<p>Yes alarms! One of the worst things that still lets me down with a smart phone compared to those Nokias.</p>
<p>I purchased a GS3 on new years eve and last friday i bought a micro sim adaptor to mini sim just so i can use my N8. I  miss symbian..</p>
<p>You just made me bid on an N8 on eBay. Gah.</p>
<p>Former  Symbian user here and the OS had some great features but when you are talking about multi-tasking i think there is a reason why apps get killed after awhile on Android. Also there was some considerable lag on my symbian device which i would attribute to how it managed its memory. Symbian was a great OS for its time but it cant mess with what is out now. They couldnt evolve fast enough to keep up. Web OS sadly i wish lived on.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree with you, and I also agree that apps should be killed (even Symbian does that after 48 apps now on Belle). It&rsquo;s just that on Android, its use of Java makes for high RAM usage, so I regularly see old apps getting killed after opening 3-4 apps on top. Backgrounding a game and opening a browser usually kills the game which is something very irritating, or the browser gets killed and reloads the page after opening 3-4 apps on top. So the app killing isn&rsquo;t a concern for me, just that apps get killed too soon. <br />
However, Android multitasking is the only option for me right now (the ability to have apps continuously run services separately makes up quite a bit) and it works fine usually, guess I should get a 2GB RAM device like the Nexus 4, that should alleviate my issues with multitasking, hehe.</p>
<p>While I think Java (and .Net) are bad decisions on mobile devices (power/performance versus native code), are you really running the same level of browser and game apps in the background on Symbian???</p>
<p>Actually im a symbian user now(yeah i know its old,but my device is still rock solid) and i must agree with you.Multitasking is really good except for the fact that open too many apps and the phone as such slows down.But otherwise,if nokia were alert few years back they could have revamped symbian and it would be a very good competitor to android and ios today.</p>
<p>No chance, code was too old, but Maemo would have been competitive.</p>
<p>Nope, I am a WP user sometimes android user when I want to hack something. None of the platforms have equal WebOS, Symbian or hell Windows Mobile when it comes to multitasking.</p>
<p>I wish somebody (Google, Apple, BB, or MS) would just buy the rights to the card multitasking on WebOS.  It&rsquo;s still far and away the best multitasking technique I&rsquo;ve used.  I&rsquo;ve never used Symbian, so I can&rsquo;t speak to this.</p>

<p>Verge Scores&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>GS3 &ndash; 9<br /><img title="" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18d4kkf8jirmrjpg/original.jpg" alt="" />
</li>
	<li>iPhone 5 &ndash; 8<br /><img title="" src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18d4kkf8hb8dgjpg/original.jpg" alt="" />

</li>
</ul>
<p>Thing reminds me of my original Galaxy S/ Lumia 900 cameras. And those were awful</p>
<p>Based on those images I&rsquo;d rank them:<br />
1. Lumia 920<br />
2. GS3<br />
3. iPhone 5<br />
4. Z10</p>
<p>The Z10 units reviewed by the Verge and Crackberry etc were probably pre-production though so I&rsquo;d hope the camera&rsquo;s performance (as well as things like screen color temp) would be resolved before launch but purely based on <em>those</em> images that&rsquo;s not very impressive at all.</p>
<p>Pre-production? I doubt that&hellip;the phones are already on sale. It&rsquo;s not like the reviews came out 2 months ago.</p>
<p>What is it with this &lsquo;pre-production&rsquo; and &lsquo;review unit&rsquo; line peppered by Blackberry fans throughout this review?</p>
<p>If you only count low-light images, yes. But it didn&rsquo;t score well in other areas like video or photos with normal lighting.</p>
<p>Based on those images I&rsquo;d rank them:</p>
<p>ok: Lumia 920<br />
crap: all others</p>
<p>These are shots in low light. If you want to make good pictures in low light buy a real camera.</p>
<p>That verge background is still awesome</p>
<p>The Verge backgrounds are always awesome..</p>
<p>Can I get that background?</p>
<p>Fair review.</p>
<p>WP ecosystem and BB ecosystem have the same score?<br />
Can someone please explain this to me. Thanks</p>
<p>The.<br />
Verge.</p>
<p>Ecosystem is not just about apps. This discussion has been had elsewhere.</p>
<p>And WP has much more to offer in terms of integrated services as well.  The. Verge.</p>
<p>And BBM is nothing?</p>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t see where he said that.</p>
<p>BBM&hellip;? You&rsquo;re reaching.</p>
<p>iMessage&hellip;yeah&hellip;.Google Talk&hellip;yeah&hellip;Skype&hellip;sure&hellip;but BBM?</p>
<p><span class="caps">BBM</span> isn&rsquo;t an ecosystem, but equally <span class="caps">BBM</span> isn&rsquo;t identical to iMessage/GTalk/Skype either, especially now it supports video and screen sharing.</p>
<p>[Cue someone replying to say you can just download apps to do what <span class="caps">BBM</span> now does]</p>
<p>And they have a fair few Apps, BBM, Video Music and TV stores, and it&rsquo;s BlackBerry. So yes, they are equal. How is a Skydrive or Xbox Music app an amazing ecosystem? Included apps aren&rsquo;t an ecosystem.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see how Xbox Music and Skydrive are great features integrating your phone with the ENITRE Windows ecosystem and offering great cloud services? A couple of OS functions and APIs are lacking on WP, not the Windows ecosystem.</p>
<p>Xbox Music may be a good feature but its definitely not one to brag about.</p>
<p>Skydrive? seriously? This thing has box and dropbox integrated in the filesystem, Evernote integrated in the remember app. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and BBM also integrated deeply into the OS.</p>
<p>Integration level over 9000. &rsquo;Nuff said.</p>
<p>Dropbox? seriously? This thing has skydrive integrated in the filesystem, OneNote, Exel, Word and Powerpoint integrated. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn  also integrated deeply into the OS.</p>
<p>Integration level over 9000. &rsquo;Nuff said.</p>
<p>Skydrive is not integrated in the file system on WP. Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin are not integrated in the OS but in the people hub.</p>
<p>Wrong, into the OS. You can share things with social networks from the Share option.</p>
<p>??? The claim made above was that these services are deeply integrated into the OS. But the Share option just uses internally the people hub too which is actually an app itself. Having such a button doesn&rsquo;t mean the service is deeply integrated into the OS.</p>
<p>So maybe you wonder what the difference is. The difference is that on BB10 any service provider like for example other social networks than the big three or four can use BB10 system services to get the same deep integration for their apps. For example Google+, MySpace or Xing could do it. Users can just install such integrating apps from the BB World like normal apps.</p>
<p>While as a service provider you have to ask Microsoft to get support in the WP people hub and you have to wait for them to roll out a system update.</p>
<p>If as you say eco system is stuff integrated into the OS then why is ios not a 3? It&rsquo;s an app launcher.</p>
<p>Either ecosystem is just os, or its os plus apps. Either way wp and bb10 should be higher than a 5</p>
<p>Plus Dropbox is just a little startup that hardly anyone uses.</p>
<p>you forgot the /s</p>
<p>Holy crap, how is it that 1/3 of the comment on the BB10 review are complaints about WP8 ecosystem score.  Did that many people come to read the review just to crap on the ecosystem scoring.</p>
<p>You know it might all be an evil plot by Topolsky to drive traffic.  He gives WP8 a low ecosystem score and all the WP8 fans have to read every other OS review and phone release to complain about scoring.  Maybe you guys can push up the WP9 ecosystem score by thwarting his evil plan and no longer comment on other OS&rsquo;s reviews.  Or you could focus on the most poorly reviewed portion of BB10&rsquo;s ecosystem was actually a Microsoft product, Bing Maps, maybe the conspiracy goes even deeper.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re advocating Josh is an unethical pageviewaholic?</p>
<p>WP8 doesn&rsquo;t even use Bing Maps anymore. That aside: Blackberry doesn&rsquo;t offer any Kind of offline mapping functionality, unlike WP8. Curious question: is there any offline turn-by-turn Nav for BB10.</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10: Day one of launch and already better than Windows Phone.</p>
<p>You mad bro?</p>
<p>Did you read the review?</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing about that is that Josh is actually wrong about BB10 using Bing maps. It uses Tom Tom which is that same maps apple uses. But far be it from Josh to pass up a chance to criticise something from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Edit: actually it appears to be using some kind of weird fusion of tomtom and bing.</p>
<p>You mean music, movies, books, tv shows, cross platform integration?  Starting a movie on your phone and continue it on the TV, tablet, synchronized playlist?</p>
<p>They are equal.</p>
<p>The only logical explanation of an equal score is that the pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s for each system level each other out.</p>
<p>However, that list of pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s would show a tremendous difference between BB10 and WP8.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also argue that the lack of extended or expansive, &lsquo;sister&rsquo; or &lsquo;cousin&rsquo; devices within the Blackberry eco is a MAJOR con and that alone should make the eco 4 instead of 5.</p>
<p>iOS, Android and WP8 all have apps and hardware that have a certain amount of connectivity.  What does BB have?  A 2 year old 7 inch tablet that no one wanted?  Think I&rsquo;m being a troll&hellip; but HP Touchpad goes on fire sale and the internet nearly caught on fire.  Playbook goes on fire sale and everyone hit the snooze button.</p>
<p>The touchpad could be modded to run Android, and had decent hardware or at least comparable to the Android tablets at the time.  The playbook didn&rsquo;t have any of those things, it had the same Android emulation that was bad, and couldn&rsquo;t be hacked to run actual Android.</p>
<p>It had modern hardware for the time. Even still, to a degree.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has no consumer service ecosystem beyond BBM, and even that is not very important. Microsoft has Office, Xbox Live, Xbox media services, Skype, Outlook.com, Bing, location services, SkyDrive.</p>
<p>Between crappy apps and far fewer services, BB10 should be nowhere close to 5 &ndash; unless The Verge intends to reevaluate their WP8 score.</p>
<p>I agree it&rsquo;s a nice list of apps to have and they might just come handy some day. But it&rsquo;s not something to brag about. Some of these apps are missing on Android and iOS but no ones complaining.</p>
<p>The fact that some of the big name developers were on BB10 right out of the gate says alot about the strength of that platform. By the time these devices launch in the US, we will have instagram and Netflix too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BlackBerry has no consumer service ecosystem beyond <span class="caps">BBM</span>, and even that is not very important</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go ask Terry Myerson if he thinks 70M users is &lsquo;not very important&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And you probably missed the bit about being able to buy music, films and TV shows from BB World and publications from Newsstand.</p>
<p>It means WP8&rsquo;s ecosystem at the time of review was on the same level as BB10&rsquo;s ecosystem at the time of review.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
<p>Really? Because even that is just plain false. If you meant to say WP7 then yes, that would be more comparable.</p>
<p>Ecosystem ratings are nonsense.  They are only taking into consideration the number of apps available.  Any app that&rsquo;s worth installing will eventually be available for all systems.  iOS and their 70 trillion spam apps doesn&rsquo;t make the ecosystem better, it makes it worse.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that The Verge take ease of development and native-store submission into consideration when evaluating an ecosystem.  From tooling, to requiring a Mac, to unreasonable fees, to review delays, censorship, and locking down the ability to even sideload your own app on your own device without subscription, It&rsquo;s a fact that developing for iOS is not an ideal experience.</p>
<p>I think that you are overlooking some real challenges for the WP8 platform.  Lots of people point to the integration with various microsoft services, like Bing or Skydrive, but that integration can be a two edged sword.  I was on a WP7.5 phone for 6 months and I couldn&rsquo;t stand Bing, and at least at the time I couldn&rsquo;t change it to google search.  Bing just wasn&rsquo;t useful, especially for local searches, which are 2/3 of the mobile searches I do.   Likewise, the Outlook integration is a blessing and curse when paired with the lower level of support for the more popular Gmail.</p>
<p>I agree that the Apple&rsquo;s policies create a barrier to development but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to hurt them.  I don&rsquo;t use iOS anymore but other than Google and Microsoft&rsquo;s own apps I can&rsquo;t think of any major apps that aren&rsquo;t release first on iOS.  I just haven&rsquo;t ran into any situations where a company, transit system, or major service has an app for Android or WP8 and not iOS.  Sadly, Apple&rsquo;s unfriendly policies don&rsquo;t seem to be hurting their ecosystem in a measurable ways.</p>
<p>Agreed, though thankfully there is at least a Google Search app which, while not as convenient as having the search key bring up Google, is still an effective work around.</p>
<p>I agree actually, I think Josh is pretty reasonable and fair here. Credit where its due etc. Says its even very good, but also needs a few things. I expected Netflix for example, but really I find my PS VIta is my excellent entertainment machine and the screen is 5 inch. So that is a slight against it. Also it was actually pretty work focused bunch of feature.</p>
<p>I know though, it is the platform for me. I tried others. If I really want apps, then I&rsquo;ll adopt a itouch or ipad, basically. Great start</p>
<p>I agree. It seems like everything you would expect from a 1.0 device: a solid performer that delivers on the vision, but still has some bugs, rough edges, and frameworks to be filled out, but no showstoppers.</p>
<p>A 7 seems like exactly the right score. It could be a 9 by the time it gets to v2.1&hellip; if it ever makes it that far. It&rsquo;s definitely starting out from a better position than Android did, for what that&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>Dat Profile Pic and Dat Name</p>
<p>You gotta love it! Connect with me on Friendster so we can talk about it some more!</p>
<p>7.0 ouch!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>That is a good score.</p>
<p>Compared to what, exactly? lol</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to compare it to anything. It just means you&rsquo;ll be looking over your shoulders for some other OS&rsquo;s features, but you won&rsquo;t feel like killing yourself while using it.</p>
<p>Because you say so?</p>
<p>7.0 means that it&rsquo;s a solid phone. I&rsquo;m impressed.</p>
<p>Battery life, some notification tweaks and getting rid of the emulator* would probably put the phone near an 8. All of those things are (or seem to be in the case of battery life) software problems &mdash; problems I thought would be far more numerous.</p>
<p>Am I buying &mdash; no.<br />
Would I dissuade someone who wanted to buy &mdash; absolutely not. And that is a great first step.</p>
<p>*I bet this is what was partly responsible for the battery life problems, because they were so erratic. Software bugs are the other.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just wondering how many of those Android apps they&rsquo;re throwing in with the 70,000 launch apps they have right now.</p>
<p>Not read yet. 7.0? Good first attempt. Good luck Blackberry!!</p>
<p>Are you willing to buy a &ldquo;good first attempt&rdquo;, though?</p>
<p>The HTC One X got an amazing review here and it was still a failure commercially. Still, this review was more generous than what I&rsquo;d expected.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the review was fair. iPhone devotees should not give reviews on other devices. I think the BB10 is a device that will suite business needs well. I think that a 7 is a trash rating. Unlike the masses,Twitter, Facebook, and all the other social intelligence gathering nonsense is not the highlight of this phone. It&rsquo;s there to gain some mass traffic, but it is a business tool.</p>
<p>someone call wildlife conservation! they need to know i just found a living breathing blackberry fanboy!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 7 out of 10. A 3 would&rsquo;ve been trash.</p>
<p>You realize that businesses have already started moving to iOS and Android. This device needs to bring something to the table to get them to move back, which it doesn&rsquo;t seem to do yet.</p>
<p>You realize that most businesses still use Blackberry right? <strong>Some</strong> business allow byod but most do not. They&rsquo;ll have an easier time going from old Blackberries to new ones.</p>
<p>That may be true, but the trend is rapidly moving away from BES and toward the BYOD; that&rsquo;s why the topic has comes up at every earnings call with every mobile company in the last couple quarters. Complacency is what got RIM in this state to being with, they can&rsquo;t afford to let that happen again.</p>
<p>your source please&hellip;.</p>
<p>RIM (now BB) has the most users it has ever had so if people and businesses are moving away, why are they gaining more customers QxQ, YxY?</p>
<p>Apparently not gaining recently:<br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/technology/a-million-users-desert-blackberry-and-revenue-falls-48.html?_r=0" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/technology/a-million-users-desert-blackberry-and-revenue-falls-48.html?_r=0</a></p>
<p>Also there&rsquo;s about 300 million iPhone users versus the 79 million Blackberry users, so&hellip;?</p>
<p>There are more BB users in 2012 than 2011 than 2010 and so on&hellip;.  I predict that there will be more in 2013 than 2012.   Last Q does not indicate much yet other than they have not released a new flagship phone for 1.5 years. If next Q and the Q after they keep going backwards then there is a problem, but as it stands BB has grown customers year over year every year they have existed which is not a pattern of desertion but one of sustained growth.</p>
<p>Most of those users are doing so only because Blackberrys are super cheap. There&rsquo;s nothing out now suggesting a Curve alternative that would put the existing users on BB10.</p>
<p>The still are growing users regardless how you try to angle the light.</p>
<p>I think BES is no longer required and BB10 supports ActiveSync. So basically if your company is paying for an Exchange server to push email, it no longer has to pay for a separate BES server.</p>
<p>Lost revenue for Blackberry. More for Microsoft.</p>
<p>Unless they find its cheaper setting up an Exchange Server and letting employees use their own phones.</p>
<p>I agree with you about how reviewers should try and be totally open minded when it comes to reviewing something that&rsquo;s not their daily driver.</p>
<p>Josh personally uses an Android phone and prefers it over an iphone. So I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s some iphone devotee.</p>
<p>Please stop with the &ldquo;tools not toys&rdquo; crap. This is the thinking that led to BB being where it is now. Do you know that ICE, the US federal immigration enforcement agency contracted Apple to supply them with $2m worth of iPhones because BBs screens weren&rsquo;t sensitive enough to do fingerprint scans and they had trouble finding developers that could even make it happen on the ancient J2ME platform BB7 was built on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you know that <span class="caps">ICE</span>, the US federal immigration enforcement agency contracted Apple to supply them with $2m worth of iPhones</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t they do a U-turn on that?  Or was that another agency?</p>
<p>Josh was using a Galaxy Nexus last I checked and he wrote an article before that came out about how he kept coming back to the Nexus S every time he went to something else.</p>
<p>Would have loved to see a score above 7.5.  But I guess no account is given for the blood, sweat and tears that goes into the making of these things.</p>
<p>What we have instead is high scores and accolades for copy cats who have reverse engineered other people&#8217;s designs.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p>The. End.</p>
<p>Josh, from Droid DNA to HTC Thunderbolt to iPhone 4S, How exactly bad is the battery life?</p>
<p>He said He&rsquo;d get up at 7-8 and last until around 6-7. That&rsquo;s 10-12 hours of battery life. How is that bad?</p>
<p>It really depends on how much he was using it during that time. I can leave my iPhone 5 on standby for at least 2 days, and with my moderate usage during the day, I typically wind up with 60-70% battery at 7PM.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an iPhone remember.</p>
<p>Blackberry forums that way <del>-</del>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rarr;</p>
<p>[Mind the tumbleweed]</p>
<p>I hate subjective battery tests.</p>
<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re too much like actually using a phone you bought and having it die at 6PM every day.</p>
<p>what if you use the phone more often because it&rsquo;s better for more tasks?<br />
I agree I hate subjective battery tests. They should do what gsmarena do, battery benchmarks.</p>
<p>Not everybody uses it the same way. Objective tests are much better for comparison unless you want to test every single unit against every single smartphone user out there.</p>
<p>I can get up around 5-6am and the phone is just getting into the red sometimes around midnight and that is with heavy use including apps like GOOD which are battery hogs.  This is on an iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Heavy use also includes some media type apps for music and games sometimes on my commute.</p>
<p>Pretty much &ldquo;meh&rdquo;, which in this market basically means it&rsquo;s DOA. I can&rsquo;t imagine people abandoning their bought-into ecosystems for a phone that offers nothing new or exciting.</p>
<p>Well, they&rsquo;ve slashed about half of their global staff in the run up to this launch, so maybe that will help</p>
<p>A serious 4th platform is exciting, remember this is a 10yr evolving platform.</p>
<p>Lol what does this even mean. You&rsquo;re almost as bad as Mr. Hines on stage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not meh for blackberry people like me. It is EXCITING. If you still use a blackberry and are thinking about updating your device, this will be a compelling option.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m happy for all ten of you.</p>
<p>There are 79 million of us. Keep up.</p>
<p>Only 25%  of that number even live in countries where BB10 might be considered affordable. As a BB fan, you and I both know that the 79 million number is misleading and that people in India or Indonesia using a $100 Curve will not upgrade to BB10 anytime soon, so why continue to bring it up?</p>
<p>Yes I know it&rsquo;s a lot of cash strapped $99 curve owning people in Africa and Asia. But there are still several million users in the US, Canada, UAE, and the UK that can afford BB10. Additionally, that 79 million number will matter when BlackBerry releases a $100 BB10 device and those curve users start to upgrade. Either way, he comes at me with &ldquo;ten of you&rdquo;, I hit him with some actual stats. His original &ldquo;DOA&rdquo; assertion is just wrong, that&rsquo;s what I was responding to. Probably shouldn&rsquo;t have even wasted my time&hellip;</p>
<p>It will be awhile before the hardware used on BB10 will be $100.  It&rsquo;s the same reason Nokia&rsquo;s WP8 devices are just now at the $200 price point without contract.</p>
<p>Can <span class="caps">QNX</span> run on anything less than dual core? It&rsquo;ll be a while before hardware costs them that $100. Even then, the margins will be so thin it might now be worth it.</p>
<p>That is assuming they have bought in to better ecosystems already. You&rsquo;d be surprised how many people still carry BBs.</p>
<p>Pretty much. This would have been nice and had a chance to strive if it came out 3-4 years ago. Now that iPhones and Android phone are so established I don&rsquo;t think it will gain any market share. The only chance BB has to survive to keep a hold of their niche buisness/government market. Even if they can do that I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they fold and are bought out a year to year and a half from now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if they fold and are bought out a year to year and a half from now</p>

<p>Funny, people were saying the same a year and a half ago&hellip;</p>
<p>I am buying it in May &hellip;unlocked only.. else not buying&hellip;</p>
<p>7.0 = worst phone ever made.</p>
<p>Well, same as the Wii U&hellip; not a big deal</p>
<p>And the Wii U is such a smashing success. Oh wait.</p>
<p>The Verge review was clearly the only variable affecting Wii U sales. It couldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with that shitty iPad-type controller it came with, the Xbox 360-level graphics and the complete lack of any franchises that aren&rsquo;t made for 6-year olds.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a supposed &ldquo;hard core&rdquo; gamer? This is why gaming and tech sites just can&rsquo;t mix together. They are completely different audiences, and people from either side really needs to do some research and actually understand what the views from each industry is.</p>
<p>I find it appalling that the mentality of &ldquo;games have to be rated mature in order to be good&rdquo;, still sticks around on the internet. Consoles are for the games you play, games have to be fun in order to be good, people have differing opinions but seriously stop behaving in a childish manner.</p>
<p>P.S. I own all three consoles (no Wii U yet, because it&rsquo;s not a value for me yet, there are quality games releasing soon that will warrant a purchase from me), I&rsquo;m a gamer, I enjoy games and judge them if they&rsquo;re a good game/franchise by playing them and not by what their age rating is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a gamer at all. I play time-killing stuff like FIFA, Burnout, Need for Speed and MW3 with my friends. As I recall, these were franchises that existed on previous Nintendo consoles&hellip;I spent many high school days playing stuff like Perfect Dark, FIFA and Burnout 3 on my friends&rsquo; Gamecube.</p>
<p>With the Wii, Nintendo has made it clear that they&rsquo;re interested in the family and child market and developers have moved their key franchises away in response. Before that, you could still have Mario Party on the Gamecube as well as Burnout. Now it&rsquo;s just kiddy bullshit and nothing else. And I&rsquo;m not the type to obsess about graphics, but a $399 console in this day and age should not only now be catching up to the 2005 Xbox 360.</p>
<p>I am both and I agree with you. It&rsquo;s about the actual gameplay.</p>
<p>The Wii U is a great smartphone.</p>
<p>I just have a hard time fitting it into my pocket&#8230;.</p>
<p>I like BB10.</p>
<p>BlackBerry by choice hommie.</p>
<p>Been using it for the last 4 days&hellip; it&rsquo;s a nifty smartphone&hellip; and surely is my next&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait. Bye bye iPhone 5. Hello BlackBerry Z10!</p>
<p>I see you there, Thurston.</p>
<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s Wednesday &mdash; unless you&rsquo;re in the Far East &mdash; in which case, it&rsquo;d be Thursday &mdash; you are correct.</p>
<p>lol wut?</p>
<p>Bertie: Well, perhaps I didn&rsquo;t quite explain it well enough. Here&rsquo;s another bit they do. Yes, you see there are these two deaf chaps on a train, and it stops at Wembley.<br />
Charlotte: What&rsquo;s he doing?<br />
Myrtle: Mr. Fink-Nottle is telling an anecdote.<br />
Bertie (as Mr. Fink-Nottle): Well, anyway, there it is at Wembley. And one of the chaps says, is this Wembley? And the other says, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Thursday.&rdquo;<br />
Charlotte: What did he say?<br />
Emmeline: He said, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s Thursday.&rdquo;<br />
Charlotte: No, it&rsquo;s not, it&rsquo;s Friday! I know because I changed my library book.<br />
Myrtle: It&rsquo;s a joke, Charlotte!<br />
Bertie: Thank you. So then the first one says, &ldquo;Thirsty? Oh, really? So am I, let&rsquo;s go have a drink!&rdquo; Ha, ha.<br />
Harriet: It&rsquo;s a joke about drink, Charlotte.<br />
Bertie: No, no, it&rsquo;s not about drink. It&rsquo;s about&hellip;um&hellip;<br />
Emmeline: Why did the first man bring up the days of the week?</p>
<p>From Jeeves and the Mating Season. If you are not a Jeeves and Wooster fan, we&rsquo;ll, <em>it takes all sorts to make a world</em>.</p>
<p>There are people who are not Jeeves and Wooster fans?</p>
<p>There are two types of people in the world, those who are Jeeves and Wooster fans, and those who have never been enlightened. Forgive the latter their ignorance, for they do not know what they miss.</p>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t, wtf is &ldquo;Jeeves and Wooster&rdquo;?  I&rsquo;ve never even heard of that O_o</p>
<p>I forgive you your ignorance, for you know not what you miss.</p>

<p>And, of course, it&rsquo;s Thorsten Heins, not Thursday.</p>
<p>Yea, I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this phone, but I&rsquo;m probably going to wait for the next generation.</p>
<p>I got burned with my Torch, and I just always feel like RIM screws their first adopters.</p>
<p>Burned with your torch. That&rsquo;s rather splendid.</p>

<p>Ctrl+H Research in Motion with BlackBerry</p>
<p>You really need to edit those RIM&rsquo;s &amp; &lsquo;Research in Motion&rsquo;s in the article to Blackberry now. Seriously.</p>
<p>srsly</p>
<p>What a ginormous bezel it has!</p>
<p>Totally love how huge the verge is, getting products from the topolsky time machine</p>
<p>Maps?  Carriers?</p>
<p>Is there any word on when BB10 will be available for the Playbook?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait till they drop that wonderful system into my Playbook!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</p>
<p>I think you should just be happy BB10 has arrived.</p>
<p>Hey, the Playbook user.</p>
<p>Around the same time as Windows Phone 7.8.</p>
<p>So, today then?</p>
<p>yeah, I appear to have shot myself in the foot with that one.</p>
<p>You might have to redo the voiceover seeing as RIM is no more!</p>
<p>This has BBM and a BlackBerry Keyboard. Instant buy.</p>
<p>Droid X Anyone?</p>
<p>TBH, I loved the design of the Droid X2. I wish Motorola had stuck with it.</p>
<p>I had the exact same thought.</p>
<p>Skype, Whatsapp, FaceBook, Twitter, Foursquare, Jetpack Joy Ride, Angry Birds, TuneIn, Rdio and more! Ohh yeh!</p>
<p>Yep, all that plus <span class="caps">BBM</span>, drop box, box, hdmi out, security, exchange, Android player&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>And an ecosystem score of 5.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see the Z10 having legs compared to the Q10. I&rsquo;m not sure how many BB buyers want a high-end touchscreen-only phone, when they can have both with the Q10&hellip;</p>
<p>Presumably the battery life will be much better on the Q10 as well, given that it&rsquo;s pushing almost half as many pixels.</p>
<p>Q10 isn&rsquo;t going to be available until after the Z10 I believe, so people like me who prefer a keyboard, may end up getting the Z10 nowish instead of waiting for the Q10. If I don&rsquo;t like the Z10, I can always sell it and get a Q10.</p>
<p>The Z10 looks like a high-end modern touch-screen phone. In fact, it looks like a future iPhone in black. This might be BB&rsquo;s way to attract those churned users back to BB10, a sly clever move. Has bigger screen, with higher resolution than iPhone5, has MicroSD card and direct mini-hdmi out!. So it has a lot going for it. <span class="caps">BBM</span>, Balance, screenshare!. (Apple got to kick themselves for not doing screen share in Facetime!). Oh they can always copy now &hellip;</p>
<p>People tired of Android might swing this way as well. Also allergic WP8 people (millions of them&hellip;). The Q10 is for loyalists. When you see the keyboard in action, you wondered why <span class="caps">NONE</span> of the iOS, ANdroid people figured that out !?. Oh, now they can copy &hellip;.</p>
<p>So yes, Josh sucks at World of Goo.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I thought. (Great video review though!)<br /><img title="poor goo" src="http://chazclout.com/CV/Upload/images/wtfjosh.png" alt="poor goo" /><br />
Poor goo. :(</p>
<p>he was intentionally trolling them! Sadistic</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s no reason, none at all, to think that this can overcome Windows Phone, let alone the duopoly that Google (via Samsung) and Apple have built?</p>
<p>Speed to market wins again:  IOS was released in 2007, and Apple is still selling everyone of them that they can build.</p>
<p>Its already overcome windows phone.  Windows phone never was in the lead</p>
<p>Sales wise Windows phone is even ahead in North America&hellip;In Europe Windows phone has about 15% marketshare in some of the countries (UK which is the main area where BB was popular is now home to about 5% marketshare for WP8)..Brazil wp has about 20%</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about North America, but in the US, Comscore reports that BB has 9 million active subscribers in November 2012, which make up about 7% of the US smartphone market. This is a number that has been falling over the years, but it&rsquo;s still more than double WP, which has a 3% share, down from 3.6% from the previous quarter.</p>
<p>RIM is of course stronger in Canada, so I&rsquo;d expect an even greater share of BBs in Canada over WP.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/1/comScore_Reports_November_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">Here&rsquo;s the research.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sales wise Windows phone is even ahead in North America&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was slightly ahead in the quarter to the end of december, but that was immediately after the WP product transition and immediately before the Blackberry product transition.  I doubt it will be ahead over Q1 2013.</p>
<p>It might not be in Q1 given that the first BB10 device won&rsquo;t go on sale in most of the world until march. Q2 might be the quarter when things change although we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see what Microsoft and Nokia bring to MWC.</p>
<p>This was only US numbers we were talking about anyway.</p>
<p>Spin it all you want, but Windows phone owns a whopping 4% of the world market share. It really never even surpassed BlackBerry before the BB10 release.</p>
<p>At this point BB10 has 0% marketshare.  BB10 will eat into BB7 marketshare and not necessarily gain anything.  Just like WP did to WM.  It might take BB10 well over a year to actually gain marketshare.</p>
<p>Its got a bit more marketshare than BB10. And considering this is the new platform that Blackberry is focusing on we should measure it against that.</p>
<p>Up from 2.6% in september, so yeah&hellip;..point is wp and bb10 have plenty of room to grow.</p>
<p>How is that when BB10 has just been released in a couple of areas?  BB10 will eat into BB7 just as WP7 ate into WM.  At this point BB10 marketshare is 0%.  BB7 has no more features than Nokia&rsquo;s Asha line.</p>
<p>Blackberry was released before iOS. So why aren&rsquo;t they bigger then?</p>
<p>Android was released after iOS and it&rsquo;s 3 times as big.</p>
<p>Blackberry <em>was</em> bigger. So was Windows Mobile. And Symbian. And even Palm. And Palm was the fastest to react with a new system after the iPhone. Being first means very little in the long run.</p>
<p>EDIT: also, Android is bigger because it runs on anything. Please stop with these vapid marketshare comparisons. There&rsquo;s big enough, and beyond that&hellip;</p>
<p>I replied to someone making this marketshare distinction. Go whine to him?</p>
<p>I think you mean, &ldquo;GO WHINE TO HIM!&rdquo; And you&rsquo;d be right. Oops.</p>
<p>Mr. &ldquo;Not-so-good-sequel-to-a-great-movie-that-was-an-adaptation-of-rat-pack-movie&rdquo;, take note.</p>
<p>As an aside, I just discovered the thread collapsing so that I will be able to tell who was responding to what. Context matters.</p>
<p>BB lost because of the greed from Mike and Jim, Android is bigger because it realizes that there are more non rich people than there are rich.</p>
<p>So there are no poor people using Iphones or no rich people using Android devices?</p>
<p>No, but there are more</p>
<p>Of course, that is exactly what he meant, you in no way shape or form made a completely illogical jump from one to onemillion in order to make some nonsensical point that has no bearing on anything. No sir. Nope.</p>
<p>It was not simply greed.  It was willful refusal to adapt to a changing market in order to attempt to protect existing marketshare.</p>
<p>in the ghetto of brockton I see more iPhones than anything else.</p>
<p>traditionally? because they failed the unlocked consumer market and failed Europe.</p>
<p>they still had growth for most of the companys life.. but these are markets they failed.</p>
<p>The problem that Windows Phone has is that its name carries a lot of baggage. I owned a Windows Mobile device and the experience was absolutely horrible and jumped ship as soon as a better platform came along. I know a lot of people who were in the same boat and when they hear Windows Phone, they think Windows Mobile and how awful it was; they lose the sale before they even get a chance.</p>
<p>At least BlackBerry has always had a loyal group of users (admittedly a shrinking number of users) thanks to things like BBM. No one really &ldquo;hated&rdquo; their BlackBerry devices, they just got a little long in the tooth and people upgraded to the new shiny. I think it&rsquo;s with these users that BlackBerry has a shot; not a mass exodus from any other platform, but it will keep them alive and allow them to iterate and improve the overall product.</p>
<p>A loyal group, but one that doesn&rsquo;t exist much in the US anymore.  BlackBerries current market is mostly in developing countries with cheap $100 models.  Go to an AT&amp;T store and you could get a Lumia 920 for the price of a BB Bold or Torch.  Which one would you get if you&rsquo;re an individual?</p>
<p>Um what?! You going on anything to tell that people didn&rsquo;t hate their Blackberrys? I worked in an <span class="caps">ATT</span> store and 90% of the phones people had problems with were Blackberrys (small to large problems). Non business folks had little enthusiasm for their phones.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t Blackberry already have a bigger marketshare than Microsoft?</p>
<p>Not BB10, the future of the company.</p>
<p>This will surpass WP8 volumes by Xmas for sure. It will take a far share of the Android mid-end users and some of those who wanted Android by the handset did <span class="caps">NOT</span> support MicroSD slot. Run then land in BB10 land. Oh for WP8, it is going to be a sorry state, unless Nokia has the guts to launch 10 or 20 lower end models as they once did. The current range is not moving &hellip;with lots of publicity but not moving (wrong price or wrong OS). <br />
This BB comeback is not to be under estimated. The company is more focussed than any of the others out there and it has a large portion of the services revenue to keep its cashflow in check. The other players have their own problems. BB is solving theirs in front of the customer.</p>
<p>Hardcore fan huh? Guess you&rsquo;ve been ignoring stories about the Lumia being sold out worldwide?</p>
<p>You offer no proof or even an opinion as to why it would &ldquo;take a far share of the Android mid-end users and some of those who wanted Android by the handset did <span class="caps">NOT</span> support MicroSD slot.&rdquo; Is that what you&rsquo;re clinging to? You think an SD slot is the killer feature that will have people climbing over themselves to buy Blackberrys? C&rsquo;mon son.</p>
<p>It kind of reminds me of Android graphically.</p>
<p>I wonder if this will help or hurt BlackBerry&rsquo;s chances. Android has a somewhat generic design. Yes, Holo looks nice, but people&rsquo;s experience with Android are split between the various versions and skins. This means that you need a pretty distinctive look to differentiate yourself from the Android market.</p>
<p>Microsoft has done a good job of being visually distinctive with Windows 8, and I think everyone can tell an iPhone from an Android phone these days. I wonder how big of a problem it will be for BlackBerry if the design doesn&rsquo;t scream &ldquo;This is something you haven&rsquo;t seen before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being different for the sake of being different doesn&rsquo;t cut it, as WP sales clearly demonstrate. It needs to work for what people want to do.</p>
<p>The mass consumer isn&rsquo;t writing spreadsheets on their phones. This may be a shock but they call, text, play and few games and Facebook a little.</p>
<p>People who are shown Windows Phone love it, they just mostly haven&rsquo;t been exposed to it.</p>
<p>Basic design of the OS (open apps, app drawer and notifications/messages) is almost directly from Nokia N9.</p>
<p>This may not work out too badly for them.</p>
<p>As much as we ridicule them in tech circles, BlackBerry continues to maintain brand cachet among teens and businesses. Not every business has switched to the iPhone; in my experience, many enterprises view Apple as unpredictable and are uncomfortable relying on them for all of their mobile devices. Just having a phone that&rsquo;s good enough may be&hellip;well, good enough. Granted, the trend towards BYOD isn&rsquo;t helpful for BlackBerry, but they seem prepared for that.</p>
<p>They hit most of the important notes app-wise for teenagers (BBM is still valuable, believe it or not) and made a smartphone that is in most ways at least comparable to the competition. Battery life can be worked out with software patches; I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the models that ultimately hit the U.S. are significantly better in that regard.</p>
<p>Renaming the company to BlackBerry was a stroke of genius, considering that everyone referred to them as that anyways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m raising my prediction for BlackBerry from &ldquo;totally screwed&rdquo; to &ldquo;maybe not totally screwed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>teens like blackberry? what year have you travelled here from?</p>
<p>I commute by bus in the Boston area every day and still see a good number of them. Mostly iPhones, for sure, but there&rsquo;s plenty of BlackBerry devices lurking around.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t stop me from feeling bad for the user when I see one, though.</p>
<p>Might be different in your area, but a teen owning a BlackBerry where I live is very rare. It was more common 3-4 years ago, but even non tech savvy teens make fun of other people with BlackBerries these days. Most teens who have them around here are using them because they broke their iPhone/Android phone and the BlackBerry is the only backup they have.</p>
<p>I am a teen, and we love iPhones (mostly 4 and 4S around here, with a 5 here and there), &#8220;Galaxy&#8217;s&#8221; (mainly the S3 and a few budget Samsung), HTC&#8217;s (not as many), and surprisingly a few Windows Phones (mainly the Focus). I&#8217;ve seen 1 with a BlackBerry in my high school of 1600. We don&#8217;t like BlackBerries sorry.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s anecdotal but thanks for your input.</p>
<p>It is, but so was yours. Now I am in a relatively affluent area compared to many. The closest thing I&rsquo;ve heard to someone liking a BlackBerry here was someone saying that they kinda missed the battery life but they were fine with their iPhone&rsquo;s. (I own 2 Galaxy Nexii and a <span class="caps">RAZR</span> Maxx)</p>
<p>I also forgot to mention that being the only company with a high-end device sporting a hardware keyboard may buy them a number of users. I see people desperately clinging to their old Droid devices hoping and praying for a Droid 5 that&rsquo;s never coming.</p>
<p>I think one problem BB now has is there are other competitors in the server space that are more entrenched like <span class="caps">IBM</span> and Microsoft.  Why would I bring in <span class="caps">BBES</span> if I already have IBM&rsquo;s or Microsoft&rsquo;s server solutions for <span class="caps">BYOD</span>?  And if you&rsquo;re not getting the <span class="caps">BBES</span> then BB10 is just another phone.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BBM</span> is valuable in low cost markets where texting and data is limited, not in the markets where this phone will be launched. Especially the US where almost everyone has unlimited texting.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say I love it. But it has potential to be the next big thing.</p>
<p>EDIT: And I&rsquo;m talking about BB10, not the Z10.</p>
<p>Does it, though? I think it could keep the company going, but I don&rsquo;t see anything that will explode. The hardware is understated and conventional. The software is competent but unexceptional. It&rsquo;s not like BB is Microsoft with a new design and unlimited cash.</p>
<p>Enough to stay alive is enough to lie in wait. There&rsquo;s a long tail of potential breakout successes &mdash; if you can be there, you have a chance, slim though it may be.</p>
<p>The biggest problem for BB is that they lost their momentum with BBM. They had the new &ldquo;MSN Messenger&rdquo; of our time, and had people locked into their ecosystem because they didn&rsquo;t want to lose touch with their friends. Now they&rsquo;ve lost that ground and any reason to be in their eco.</p>
<p>There is literally no reason for someone to switch to a BB now, and limited reason still to stay. Sure, it&rsquo;s updated&hellip;but it&rsquo;s not better in any arena.</p>
<p>Well atleast you&rsquo;re not gonna complain when you&rsquo;re handed this by IT guys at your workplace.</p>
<p>So now BB is relegated to not being bad enough to complain about? Way to shoot for the stars.</p>
<p>The next big thing? Really? This has nothing that puts it above any of the other big OSes. Those 8 cards on home screen being the most recent and the navigation to/and getting to notifications just seems clunky as hell.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s actually talking about the Platform and not the OS. Obviously they&rsquo;re gonna build more on this OS and make it better overtime. Build a new platform was the biggest challenge and they&rsquo;ve over come that.</p>
<p>Just like Windows 8, it&rsquo;s not a great OS but Microsoft can make it great</p>
<p>The difference is Microsoft is a software company.  WP8 provides a good base to add features.  BB10 in some ways looks like they tried to add every features without taking the time to see if it &ldquo;flows&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they didn&rsquo;t take a cue from the playbook and webOS and just implement the cards and gestures they already had going with the Playbook.</p>
<p>Great review.</p>
<p>Not so great for <del>RIM</del> Blackberry if they want turn the tide. Nobody in their right mind would switch from iOS/Droid to this</p>
<p>Nobody in their right mind would switch from the iPhone to the G1.</p>
<p>And it took better Android devices to sway them. Are you agreeing with matbabyak here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing his point is that you shouldn&rsquo;t judge a platform by it&rsquo;s first phone.</p>
<p>It means that just because the first attempt is underwhelming, does not mean one should count them out of the game just yet. They have deep sleeves they&rsquo;re not out just yet.</p>
<p>No one did</p>
<p>Switched from Android to BBOS7 and a Playbook last year. Just depends on the person&rsquo;s needs. Mine do not include apps outside of TuneIn Radio, a weather app, and Gtalk. But they do include free tethering (BlackBerry Bridge), so I can use my phones data on my Playbook.</p>

<p>looks like a nice device but I cant really judge unless I actually use the device for a couple days.  I hope someone I know picks one up and I can borrow it.    I wonder why there was no talk about BES in this review?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there was any talk of BES at the keynote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a good thing.</p>
<p>BES 10 was <a href="http://press.rim.com/newsroom/press/2013/blackberry-enterprise-service-10-now-available-for-download.html">released</a> days ago&hellip; <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/business/software/bes-10.html">manages</a> BB/PB, iOS and Android devices&hellip;</p>
<p>Hey Josh, nice review.. but can you please do more in-depth with the  video call? How does it performs against with iOS&rsquo;s FaceTime? I&rsquo;m deaf. :)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alicia Keys is BlackBerry&rsquo;s new Creative Director.&rdquo; &ndash; The Verge live blog.</p>
<p>And Lady GAGA is Polaroid&rsquo;s. We see how well that works.</p>
<p>&#8220;THIS PHONE IS ON FIIIRRREEEEEE!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>In New York!!!</p>
<p>When they bring in celebrities to manage stuff like this I get worried.  Intel doing it do was idiotic.  Could I be wrong?  Sure but selling a lot of albums does not qualify one to become a &ldquo;creative director&rdquo; especially when dealing with hardware/software products.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Blackberry.</p>
<p>Okay&hellip; and?</p>
<p>Garbage battery life, DOA</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but my phones don&rsquo;t last 12 hours usually. Don&rsquo;t know where Josh is getting such a negative look from.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an iPhone&hellip;.that&rsquo;s where the negative look comes from.</p>
<p>My wife&rsquo;s GS3 lasts all day. If you phone dies before you get home at the end of the day, battery life is bad. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a biased assessment. I still plan to buy one. This battery life will be on par with my existing blackberry. I have a charger at work and that&rsquo;s how I get through the day. 12 hours of battery life certainly won&rsquo;t make this phone DOA.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 owner here. I can confirm the iPhone 5 has worse battery life.</p>
<p>12 hours of battery life is considered acceptable? I get annoyed when my Lumia doesn&rsquo;t get at least 36 hours and I sorely long for a modern smartphone to exhibit battery life even remotely comparable to Symbian devices without having to transform into a pseudo-tablet.</p>
<p>If you plan to use your phone during the day yes, 12 hours is acceptable IMO.</p>
<p>Unless you come from using the Razr Maxx.</p>
<p>Or from a previous BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Battery can be swapped out, plus if you get the OEM battery charger, it has a micro USB to charge the phone with the other spare battery.</p>

<p>What is this, 2005?</p>
<p>Because swapping your battery is so 2005?  Having the ability to change your battery is a positive <span class="caps">IMO</span>.</p>
<p>surprised it took this long down the comments for a &ldquo;DOA&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interesting article, until I got here: &ldquo;&hellip;made talking on the phone (something I generally try to avoid) pleasant when it happened.&rdquo; Then, I stopped reading. Yeah, we get it; you&rsquo;re too <del>-socially awkward</del>- cool to actually carry on a phone conversation. (yawn)</p>
<p>WOW!! My EMAIL TO JOSH : Hasan Munakib Choudhury is on the VIDEO!!! HOW COOOOOL! I am finally Famous!</p>
<p>@ 2:02 minute into the video</p>
<p>congrats</p>
<p>Too bad they didn&rsquo;t get everything in order for the launch. Seems like WP8 will be third after all.</p>
<p>i think that the review indeed might be fair. However, i think the story may be different with blackberry&rsquo;s corporate customers.  Given IT&rsquo;s groups long history with BB devices, a company may be apt to switch back from Iphones to Blackberries.  From what i can see, they will be cheaper and potentially more secure (given that most iphones can still be jailbroken).  Battery life hurts, quite obviously, but i&rsquo;ve seen statistics that suggest better life off of 4g, and presumably if you&rsquo;re using this for work, emails and messages won&rsquo;t require an LTE connection.  I think there&rsquo;s potential here, and if BB plays this right (licencing, etc. etc.), that financially, RIMM can pull itself out of the hole.</p>
<p>The problem is once you chuck the infrastructure to support BB having to rebuild it is expensive.  It&rsquo;s not about licenses only.  Switching back will then incur capital expenditures which most companies are avoiding as much as possible now.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see what happens in the public sector too. There is light:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/u-s-agency-gives-blackberry-10-a-chance-after-iphone-coup-7000008741/">U.S. agency gives BlackBerry 10 a chance after iPhone coup</a></p>
<p>Recent <span class="caps">ATT</span> phones have not given an option to disable <span class="caps">LTE</span>. And while this is a Blackberry this is a new OS that IT has to certify and test before they deploy it. That costs money.</p>
<p>Josh&#8230; you&#8217;re definitely sounding ill in the video..  excellent review nevertheless.</p>
<p>The OS looks good. Few changes here and there and I&#8217;ll get one. Silk on a Gnexus right now.</p>
<p>RIP RIM</p>
<p>Long live BlackBerry!</p>
<p>This is unfortunate&hellip; I really had hoped Blackberry would pull it off</p>
<p>So let me get this straight. Blackberry 10 doesn&rsquo;t have close to the same level of interoperability and integration with Windows, Cloud storage, music, videos, XBox for the living room and the other features that Windows Phone has and yet it gets the same ecosystem score? Hmmmm&hellip;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s funny interoperability between windows and xbox devices are severely lacking still.</p>
<p>From what I saw on the livestream, it has really good interoperability and integration. There was also lots of misquotes by the team.</p>
<p>Probably because of Android apps.</p>
<p>BB10 is far better than iOS 6.</p>
<p>How far better?</p>
<p>16cm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m joking. I think Blackberry Peek/Hub, Balance and Flow (real time multitasking) makes BB10 better than iOS6.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy iPhone &amp; Macbook Air user, but yeah, this one is good.</p>
<p>I would not say all that.</p>
<p>There were not any fresh ideas about the hardware. The new os, sounds great. But there were too much gesture, sort of fuzzy.</p>
<p>Wait.  RIM reinvented his own name, the OS, the camera and switched completely to touchscreen, but they took the old design and just matched it to the new on? The BlackBerrz z10 looks so poorly and I wouldn&#8217;t dare to compare it to the iPhone. Not because I own the iPhone but because there is nothing admirable in BB&#8217;s design: it looks cheap ( in fact, it looks like the htc one x, just bigger), has no significant lines-it&#8217;s pure plastic. For instance: look at Sony&#8217;s phones , they used the idea to built devices with plastic and making it look neat and elegant  properly. Blackberry failed so hard with that design and it disappoints me. Design used to be partly their flagship</p>
<p>It look incredibly unpleasant to hold too with all those sharp edges. So that would imply they actually tried to go for aesthetics over comfort/functionality, but failed.</p>
<p>Looks.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess.</p>
<p>Sort of like a certain wildly popular phone from Cupertino, eh?  (And I agree sharp edged phones are uncomfortable, although J-Top says the z10 feels good)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wait. RIM reinvented his own name, the OS, the camera and <strong>switched completely to touchscreen</strong>, but they took the old design and just matched it to the new on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone didn&rsquo;t notice the Q10.</p>
<p>Where the hell do you get that it looks like a bigger One X?!</p>
<p>Find and replace would have made this article better. Find &ldquo;Research in Motion&rdquo; replace with Blackberry  find &ldquo;RIM&rdquo; replace with Blackberry" Lol. Not that I blame you since it&rsquo;s hard to think of editing your article when something like that is announced but hey.</p>
<p>Great review Josh and well balanced &ndash; not a shill for Blackberry and not a hater.  Your overview of the OS was much better than the launch demo.</p>
<p>Since I cant get the nexus 4 on verizon&hellip;&hellip;im thinking i might try this device out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure this is beter than what we already have&hellip;<br /><img title="" src="http://i.cubeupload.com/MN9nx8.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>that&rsquo;s the thing, i don&rsquo;t think it needs to be.  The benefits for many large corporations here is pretty obvious.  And if managing these new devices that are cheaper than iphones is easier and less costly that managing iphones, then i think you&rsquo;d see more adoption from large companies.  It has to just be on par, and i think this device will still sell.</p>
<p>But still, for some margin of true succes you will surely need people to be like: &ldquo;I like this&hellip; when I buy this my life will be better and everyone will love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You mean the same large corporations that are Microsoft/<span class="caps">IBM</span> shops that already use their solutions for mobile devices?  If you&rsquo;ve already moved from <span class="caps">BBES</span>, what is the benefit of buying BB10 devices.</p>
<p>Josh, ave you ever tried SwiftKey on Android? I ask because they are supposedly powering the predictive text if not all of the logic for the BB soft kb.</p>
<p>I think SwiftKey powers all touchscreen keyboards now a days</p>
<p>Good start from RIM, er&hellip; BlackBerry. Hopefully they can turn it around.</p>
<p>HAH! I&rsquo;m in Josh&rsquo;s Twitter feed in the video!</p>
<p>&ldquo;J-Tops!&rdquo; @bjom77</p>
<p>Wait&hellip;.  Did RIM just announce a mid range Android phone?</p>
<p>When did mid-range Android phones get 356 PPI screens?</p>
<p>Well you could basically consider the One-X a mid range at this point and with MWC right around the corner 720p will probably be on everything with 1080p screens being on the high end.</p>
<p>The iPhone?   This thing is the spitting image of the Droid X.     Seriously go back and look at the Droid X and this.  I don&rsquo;t see the iPhone at all,  Moto  yeah def. the Droid X.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t, not from a view that isn&rsquo;t directly from the front.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m referring to, the front side is what you look at 99% of the time.  straight on,  the Z10 and the Droid X were switched at birth</p>
<p>Looks like a mix of the 2. The iPhone is the first thing I thought of, but I also see some of the Droid X.</p>
<p>Actually, the front of the Z10 looks more like the back of an Iphone5. If this Z10 had the hard buttons, it might look more like the Droid X.</p>
<p>With that said, This is why I think hardware patents for a touchscreen phone are utterly ridiculous. There&rsquo;s only so much you can do with the design of a touchscreen phone before it starts to look like something from your competition.</p>
<p>As far as the z10 goes, It will definitely appease owners of blackberries, who&rsquo;re looking for a more modern upgrade. I don&rsquo;t see people leaving ios or android to get back with BB.</p>
<p>I think its a competitive product.Its good,eventually could become my daily driver,the only request that I have now its good apps.</p>
<p>What are the good apps that BB is missing?</p>
<p>Instagram, Netflix, Flipboard, the usual.</p>
<p>Outside of Netflix, I&rsquo;ve never used the ones of which you speak. I would say that &ldquo;good&rdquo; is relative to indiviual use.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The OS looks very smooth, however the overall design language of it looks a little confused, and a pick and mix from all of Android, WP and iOS and the gesture stuff looks like it was directly implemented when they saw Ubuntu OS announced.. It doesn&rsquo;t really work well.</p>
<p>Uh, Ubuntu looks like it took it from BB10. They can&rsquo;t add gestures that integrated into the platform and having it work reliably when gestures is what BB10 is all about. Even the hardware was designed with no screen buttons.</p>
<p>Do you think the &ldquo;design language&rdquo; of it looks a little confused, or do you think the DESIGN of it looks a little confused, or do you think the DESIGN of the phone is confusING, since the design is an inert unconscious attribute that can be no more confused than the color or the weight of the phone?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if everything that could ever have been designed already exists and they were forced to cobble their platform&rsquo;s design together from those existing pieces. Some of which didn&rsquo;t even exist until after they completed there design. Too bad they couldn&rsquo;t make something new. /s</p>
<p>Announcing the much-anticipated competitor to the Palm Post.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it will be very difficult to convince people, who spent money on apps and some media, and have set up an ecosystem which works well, to change to a new platform, whatever it is, where they&rsquo;ll have to buy all the content again. I agree with Josh this thing came too late, and doesn&rsquo;t add anything worth to make the switch.</p>
<p>The same could be said about Windows Phone, but the Lumia line is showing some positive results for Nokia.</p>
<p>Nokia and WP8 has a much better and functional integrated ecosystem. Even their media options are better, offering streaming and downloads, where this only offers downloads. BB10 is inferior, to all the major mobile OS&rsquo;s out there, sad to say.</p>
<p>In terms of business use though, BB still has the upper hand.</p>
<p>Blackberry Balance is the only potential killer feature with BB10.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t buy this phone.  BUT, if/when my employer (a Fortune 300 company) gives me a choice on my next work phone between a locked down iPhone with no personal apps, or a locked down BB10 where I can potentially install personal apps via BB balance, I&rsquo;d give the Z10 a very serious look.</p>
<p>This review is written from the perspective of individual consumers.  BB has already lost that market.  Their only remaining market is with large organizations with security concerns that disallow &ldquo;bring your own device&rdquo; policies.  BB10 still has a fighting chance with that market.</p>
<p>This, many times this.</p>
<p>Consumer market isn&rsquo;t lost yet and BlackBerry can&rsquo;t exist at their current size as an enterprise only offering. There simply isn&rsquo;t enough revenue in their enterprise business to sustain the company in it&rsquo;s current state. I think this is a good start for BlackBerry to get back in the game. It&rsquo;s not going to happen overnight though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already getting one from work. I&rsquo;m excited.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not about BB10 it&rsquo;s whether these Fortune 300 companies are going to bring in BB Enterprise Server on continue using solutions that fit their <span class="caps">IBM</span>/Microsoft environment.  That&rsquo;s the real sale, not the phone.  Balance can only be used with <span class="caps">BBES</span>.</p>
<p>This is what the low cost iPhone will look like when it comes out in a few months. No joke.</p>
<p>ha.</p>
<p>As many have said, the low cost iPhone is already here. It is called, the iPhone 4.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see a big future for the OS considering that they are already battered as it is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows you to snap and then choose a frame from a serious of shots after (and supposedly before, but not really) the frame you wanted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone forgot to run this review through a basic grammar check.</p>
<p>In the video review, Josh reminds us of his little gripe with twitter @ replies in the Me Hub not showing fully until you tap on the notification on Windows Phone. Just a note that this has now been fixed since this week, when Microsoft begun to roll out the Portico update to users outside of the US, worldwide. So, you now see full tweets previewed in the notification area! Now, if only they integrated DMs into the messaging hub (like they have with Facebook messages) as I&rsquo;ve suggested before&hellip;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll never use Windows Phone on a daily basis, likely.</p>
<p>Hey Josh, Windows Phone fixed the tap-to-see-full-tweet thing. Now, the full reply to a tweet is displayed in the notification list. You only have to tap into it if you want to reply to the reply.</p>
<p>Which proves he doesn&rsquo;t know jack about WP.</p>
<p>So why was there no mention of the Balance feature &ndash; the ability to switch easily from personal to business modes? I think this is a very cool feature that would be extremely useful for many people. In fact one might even argue that that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;killer app/feature&rdquo; that Josh said was lacking. Pretty much every medium to large business has to deal with the &ldquo;device dilemma&rdquo; &ndash; do you allow people to use their own devices for work, and if you do then how do you keep it secure, or do you give them a separate device which costs you extra? With BB10 this potentially is no longer an issue.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not saying that this kinda thing would cause me to switch platforms. But if I were in the market for a new device and I was comparing Android to iOS and to BB10, balance would definitely be a big part of the decision.</p>
<p>RIM&rsquo;s presentation will cover the Balance feature. While I agree that that maybe could have been mentioned in this review, it&rsquo;s really only relevant to IT managers, who would not be getting their intel from a Verge review.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand why it would be relevant only to IT managers? It&rsquo;s relevant to any potential BB user that would be using the device in a business environment and unless we&rsquo;re assuming that only teenagers read the Verge (andI don&rsquo;t think anyone is doing that), then it should be relevant to many of the Verge&rsquo;s readers.</p>
<p>You need BB Enterprise Server to use the balance feature.</p>
<p>If Android were to bring its user profiles to the phone this could easily compete with balance.</p>
<p>Consumers generally won&rsquo;t care about balance.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/34091128.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I totally agree&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The HTC DNA had a continuous shooting which takes multiple shots and then select the best one.  Samsung has the option to select certain faces and use that photo&hellip;this is not new to BBY&hellip;.</p>
<p>Definitely not new to Best Buy. They&rsquo;ve been selling cameras before there were camera phones.</p>
<p>Oops.  Sorry about that&hellip;yeah, dont think Best Buy is doing anything original these days.</p>
<p>So do Lumias now. It isn&rsquo;t new, definitely not.</p>
<p>This may just be a New York thing, but I can&rsquo;t see the name of this phone without thinking of Z100, the local Top 40 radio station.</p>
<p><img title="z100" src="http://theboken.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/z100.gif" alt="z100" /></p>
<p>Given that Blackberry and Windows Phone will be the ones fighting over 3rd place for now I would have liked to read a little more of a comparison between BB10 and WP8.</p>
<p>Not really in practice people will compare bb to android or ios. Just like when i got android i compared it to ios,and when i switched to WP, i compared it to android. People compare devices to the dominating OS typically. Ie they will be stealing market share if at all, from android or apple, a negligible percentage of people will be choosing between WP or Bb</p>
<p>Definitely looks much more interesting than Windows Phone. BB10 might not be perfect yet but it has style that can evolve. I think those WP sales numbers must look really tiny to Balmer now. Best of luck to BB10!</p>
<p>What about it is more interesting than WP8, or any other mobile OS, other than the gesture navigation?  That&rsquo;s the only unique thing I see.</p>
<p>The Hub. No one else does that.</p>
<p>The Me tile and People Hub do the same exact thing, and implements it better! Stop talking out your ass!</p>
<p>Actually I like BB10 exactly because it has a hub like WP&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ll be rocking both though :P.</p>
<p>You do know that Windows Modern Design is very raw. Tons of room for improvement. What kind of improvement. Gestures, Interactive Tiles, Notification Centers, Groups better Hubs. Modern has more potential than BB10&rsquo;s UI</p>
<p>Notification Hub is coming soon! Gestures are rumored to come.</p>
<p>A pop artist to be the creative director? Yeah! That&rsquo;s exactly what a business user wants! a cool &amp; colorful iPhone-like phone. Thanks RIM for letting the path open to Windows Phone!</p>
<p>Dear Josh<br />
We are sorry about the kerning and flabby text flow oversights, and are working everyday to make our kerning the best in class.  We are sure you will enjoy the improvements we have coming in the very near future.</p>
<p>Best Regards<br />
Blackberry</p>
<p>Great review, I was expecting a lot worse prior to the event, but during the event I got my hopes up and I guess I was right in the end.</p>
<p>Is this a great device to make me switch platforms? No, it&rsquo;s far from it, but it looks nice enough and is as good of a base as any for BlackBerry to build upon.</p>
<p>And of course, if work forces you to own a BlackBerry device, this is pretty great phone to ask.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all fine and well to say the Verge is biased against or towards BB10, and it&rsquo;s fine to say all the commenters are fanboys or haters. For me, the entire Verge review can be set aside except for this one single question: So why the Z10? Why now?</p>
<p>All the cross-talk and arguing still doesn&rsquo;t answer that question, and it&rsquo;s the one question I&rsquo;d like to see answered.</p>
<p>I think Josh answered that himself. You&rsquo;ll buy this if you&rsquo;re a BB fan. I can still see some scenarios where businesses could extend the life of the company, so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>On the consumer side that may be a different story.</p>
<p>Nothing on bbm or the separate work apps? Those features were awesome!</p>
<p>Besides the fact that The Verge staff continuously begins sentences with conjunctions and rarely uses the word <em>but</em> for it&rsquo;s intended purpose I still enjoyed the review. I think this is a great step on Blackberry&rsquo;s fight back to the top. This Z10 looks great and if given enough time they&rsquo;re ecosystem will definitely grow. People used to complain for the same reasons about Windows Phone, and even Android. I&rsquo;m not saying that Blackberry will get back to the top but they&rsquo;ll definitely win back some of those people who have jumped ship.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;ll win back people who jumped ship and invested themselves on iOS/Android. I definitely think they&rsquo;ll slow the bleeding of users, but for how long, it depends on how fast they work to catch up.</p>
<p>Holy border, Batman!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this RIM company you refer to?</p>
<p>7.0 ouch. Usually when Josh gives a 7, it&rsquo;s from feeling sorry that the device was disappointing and deserved lower score but curved up to a 7. HP Touchpad and Lumia 900 was the same.</p>
<p>RIP RIM.</p>
<p>THIS COMPANY.</p>
<p>IS. ON. FIIIIRRREEEEEEEEEEE</p>
<p>Killer review,  not so killer phone</p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can find that wallpaper?</p>
<p>found something sort of similar: <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?start=509&hl=en&tbo=d&biw=1280&bih=679&tbm=isch&tbnid=ditjQNlMYs6v6M:&imgrefurl=http:" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/imgres?start=509&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=679&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=ditjQNlMYs6v6M:&amp;imgrefurl=http:</a>//www.picstopin.com/2560/mosaic-wallpaper-abstract-wallpapers-14351/http:%257C%257Cwww*superbwallpapers*com%257Cwallpapers%257Cabstract%257Cmosaic-14351-2560&times;1600*jpg/&amp;docid=-Sze2rupw1JeDM&amp;imgurl=http://www.superbwallpapers.com/wallpapers/abstract/mosaic-14351-2560&times;1600.jpg&amp;w=2560&amp;h=1600&amp;ei=6noJUeelHoGErQfq14HoDg&amp;zoom=1&amp;ved=1t:3588,r:27,s:500,i:85&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=1140&amp;sig=105606553886233096854&amp;page=21&amp;tbnh=177&amp;tbnw=284&amp;ndsp=24&amp;tx=145&amp;ty=83</p>
<p>Omg, do you have a vendetta against bitly?</p>
<p>Nope, just reading on my phone &amp; felt lazy about shortening it via the browser. Won&rsquo;t happen again, sir. I apologize for the pain it might have caused you</p>

<p>This was the link that was provided in the Nexus 4 review</p>
<p>WP&rsquo;s are cheaper. Some have better hardware. More apps. Better built in experience. Xbox Live. RIM has the spotlight MWC momentum is coming back to Windows Phone.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this will save RIM (Blackberry) or not, but I think it will hurt Windows Phone 8 sales.</p>
<p>Why do you say that? WP&rsquo;s are cheaper more variant of different hardware. I don&rsquo;t see a lot of people paying 199$ premium price for a Z10.</p>
<p>I say that because I believe that a good percentage of WP buyers are ex-Blackberry owners. Those that were going to upgrade from WP7 to WP8, are now going to look at this new Blackberry. (Or so I think, this is just conjecture on my part.) Do you think most corporate people who own WP7 will choose WP8 over this new Blackberry? I am really not sure either way but I think the WP users are the most likely to choose Blackberry. I can&rsquo;t see an Android or iOS user switching to this new Blackberry or at least it would be very few.</p>
<p>Do you really think $199 is a premium price for a smart phone? I realize you can get a smart phone cheaper but most people in the corporate world don&rsquo;t go for the cheapest. (At least in my experience.) However, they usually don&rsquo;t go for the most expensive either. Usually I see them go for one that&rsquo;s in the middle of the price range.</p>
<p>im sorry, but who uses a wp7 in corporate?  The amoutn of people that use wp7 as corporate is very tiny and even if all of them switched to BB, it wouldn&rsquo;t make a difference because again, the user base is so tiny.  You can say &ldquo;well, my company uses wp7&rdquo;, doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. Im guessing majority of companies probably dont use wp7 devices as a primary corporate device.</p>
<p>Yes 199.99 is a premium price, if people are going to drop $200 on a phone, why drop it on a dying platform.  They want to spend $200 on platforms that can do what everybody else is doing instead of spending $200 on a platform that they hope can do everything everybody else is doing which probably be for years down the road.</p>
<p>Wp8 has it shortcomings, but they priced it realistically and also has the difference factor in it.  It is totally different from all other platforms.</p>
<p>BB10, just another variation of the experience you see on ios/android, why not get the real thing for $200.</p>
<p>Because Windows Phone is just as good or even better at certain things for example Office built in a lot of corporations use that. Skydrive, Lync awesome Nokia navigation, photography for design departments at the end of the day you can get all of that for cheaper under 100$.</p>
<p>Most corporations use a MS backend MS frontend it&rsquo;s a wise move to unify the experience easier on deployment, support and scalability.</p>
<p>WP7 is actually used in a lot of small businesses from what I been reading but in order to tackle medium to large enterprise some key features are missing but I&rsquo;m sure they will be added shortly.</p>
<p>The problem with corporate business is that a lot of companies are altering their corporate-issued hardware policies.</p>
<p>My company, which for years paid for and issued Blackberries (on a corporate Verizon account) for managers, directors and higher ups (we&rsquo;re talking employees in the hundreds here), recently ended that practice.  The new edict is &lsquo;Bring Your Own&rsquo;, a policy that was primarily driven by the users who begged to have corporate email on their shiny new iPhones.  The company saves a rather substantial chunk of change by cutting down on both Blackberry purchases and monthly service fees.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is corporate business is changing in a new environment where employees already have data plans and smartphones.  SOme of them are still die-hard Blackberry users&hellip; but those already on Android, iOS or WP aren&rsquo;t really going to switch back.  Some might, but it won&rsquo;t be that great of an impact.</p>
<p>BES 10 can support iOS, Android&hellip; and maybe one day WP8. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be all either or&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if your reasoning took that into consideration.</p>
<p>Just having Exchange is enough to work with iOS, Android and WP but you MUST have a BES to manage a Blackberry. Given that the Exchange usually is there anyway this means additional costs for the Blackberry infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you need the additional management features BES provides it might be worth a look but then again: there are lots of other companies inlcuding MS that have solutions for iOS, Android and WP.</p>
<p>For many companies it just won&rsquo;t be worth it to run additional server software and maintain it, if all they need is Mail, Calendar and Contacts synced and some basic security like a PIN enforced.</p>
<p>Thank you, fair enough. I really see that dichotomy between managing mail/calendar vs. full management (apps, work vs. personal, full secure). I believe most case uses are mail, which is why I believe simpler MDM often works, like you said. I wonder if BES will ever manage WP &ndash; I hope so.</p>
<p>I honestly wish more MS people would make constructive and intelligent  contributions such as yours on this site. Maybe I&rsquo;ll see that in another life lolll. Cheers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you <span class="caps">MUST</span> have a <span class="caps">BES</span> to manage a Blackberry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not with BB10.  Ynly need a <span class="caps">BES</span> if you have older BBs or if you want the more advanced device management features in BB10 (like Balance).</p>
<p>I think it is 199$ is quite a bit you can get a Galaxy S3, Lumia 920, Nexus 4 and a whole lot of other handsets for the same price. For 199$ I would rather recommend an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>In the corporate world not everybody buys I7 laptops MacBook Pro&rsquo;s etc. Once more affordable devices at 49$ price range comes out I can see the corporate mindset changing especially when it comes to mobile devices.</p>
<p>Heck a Lumia 620 is just as good as a BB10 for small business like I said medium/big business need a few more features but those features will be added shortly.</p>
<p>I think what he meant was that Blackberry users are extremely loyal. If they ever budged, it was most likely toward WP rather than the leading platforms, and only because the future of BB looked so grim. But with a new lease in life for RIM, those BB users could come back from WP where they&rsquo;re most likely found at a greater rate, especially since WP is still a relatively new platform and presumably they wouldn&rsquo;t be very much invested in it.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/34091813.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hmmm did worse than the Windows Phone&#8230;was not expecting that.  Just waiting to see if Apple decides to sue them for hijacking their iPhone hardware design.</p>
<p>I think the mobile market would be a lot healthier and more interesting if it more closely resembled the pre-iPhone era when you had 4-5 major competing platforms and players.</p>
<p>It seems we&rsquo;re doomed to repeat the PC history all over again.  Arguably, consumers and developers do benefit from the network effects created by one or two dominant platforms, but as fans of technology we should be encouraging diversity and choice, not warring like primitive tribes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a staunch RIM supporter and I feel this was a fair review (except for maybe the link bait article title ;)</p>
<p>I really like what their doing with BBM</p>
<p>The race for 3rd just got a little bit easier for Wp8, price a dying platform like a striving platform?  No game changing features.  Hired Alicia Keys?  at least wp8 has jessica alba.  Alba &gt; Keys</p>
<p>No really compelling reason to switch from ios/android to BB especially at that price point other than that hope and fantasy that BB will regain its position in the market i.e. brand loyalty.</p>
<p>Dont know what was more disappointing, this launch or surface pro having 23gb out of 64gb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alba &gt; Keys</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe cuter, but not more creative.</p>
<p>In no world is Alba &gt; Keys, not even in one where Keys does not exist.</p>
<p>Alba &gt; Keys in the world I go to at night.</p>
<p>As someone who has had a chance to briefly play with the Z10, I can affirm that it is a nicely made, very snappy phone. It&rsquo;s seriously really good. But here&rsquo;s the thing.  A lot of businesses have ditched their blackberries and are not going back.</p>
<p>The reason is two-fold.  1st, they&rsquo;ve already invested tons of money into supporting Android/iOS, and supporting a big heavy infrastructure for a 3rd/4th place mobile operating system just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  2nd, for enterprises, BB10 is one third of the total equation.  The device is another third.  the final third is BES (Blackberry Enterprise Server).  What Joe Public doesn&rsquo;t know is that enterprises have to upgrade their BES infrastructures to the new BB10 environment.  And it is a major re-arch that many companies won&rsquo;t want to do, ESPECIALLY if they&rsquo;re just finished putting in the hardware/software to support their shiny new Galaxy S3s and iPhone 5s.</p>
<p>Blackberry might find some minor success in the consumer/small business end because they don&rsquo;t need BES.  For the big businesses that RIM used to cater to&hellip; I don&rsquo;t like their odds.</p>
<p>Agreed, my company is not going to invest in the new BES unless it is funded by somebody else besides us.  No compelling reason for our company to install whole new server since new phones not compatible with old server and old phones not compatible with new server.</p>
<p>With more and more companies gonig ios/android as BYOD, clearly, the need for BES and BB devices is diminishing pretty rapidly.</p>
<p>Does the new BB10 really need BES?</p>
<p>It does if you want to use Balance.  Otherwise it&rsquo;s not better than iOS or Android.  And definitely not better than WP since it has the best Exchange integration.</p>
<p>the hell&rsquo;s wrong with the video player</p>
<p>The screen is too small, the OS apparently quite sucky, the hardware doesn&rsquo;t impress, app selection is quite limited.. this thing has no chances of success at all..</p>
<p>what do you want? I screen that has a hologram? Have you used it, do you even understand who the phone is made for?</p>
<p>Get real! RIM has a problem on their hands. You know why the screen is so small? Because their gestures make the phone more cumbersome than it already is on larger screens. RIM&rsquo;s gestures have placed them into a box, a very small one, literally. You see the success of these larger devices? They&rsquo;re selling! People want them! RIM will be left out of that market entirely&hellip; unless they make bigger devices and change the gestures to accommodate for them.</p>
<p>Apple gets away with making smaller devices, because they&rsquo;re Apple, but even that won&rsquo;t last for long.</p>
<p>Too true, I <span class="caps">DEMAND</span> a phone with a 6&rsquo;&rsquo; screen <span class="caps">NOW</span>!  Anything smaller is simply unusable.</p>
<p>With the plastic sections top and bottom of the screen I think this phone looks more like a Droid X than it does an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>The last line of the review says it all. There is nothing here that would make me (and most people) consider BB10 over the other 3 mobile OSs.</p>
<p>how about a unified messaging box, live apps and a killer browser?</p>
<p>A message box that&rsquo;s poorly implemented? No! WP8 has a unified messaging experience, and it does it better.</p>
<p>Live Apps, which you can&rsquo;t really control, and is also flawed in its implementation? &hellip;No!</p>
<p>Killer browser? 1 second of faster loading isn&rsquo;t going to sway consumers. BB10&rsquo;s browser does nothing the others can&rsquo;t do, or don&rsquo;t need to do. Flash? Flash is dying, and many mobile browsers still support it.</p>
<p>Get real! RIM&rsquo;s future lies in carrier support and marketing; not their actual device. And if the device can&rsquo;t deliver like its marketing will tell people it can, it will fail!</p>
<p>What I did not see, viewing the Video review and skimming the article, was &ldquo;what makes Blackberry Blackberry.&rdquo; Now, this is a touch screen only device, so we&rsquo;ll skip past the excellent hardware keyboards. Is there anything else important to Blackberry users? How about BBM? How about UMA (transferring between cellular networks and WiFi seamlessly)? How about notification LEDs, once the final holdout of Blackberries everywhere? And as others have mentioned, what about the things you spend a lot of time doing? How about mapping and directions? Or the experience of having a conversation over text message? Comparing this to iOS, Android and Windows Phone is fine. It makes sense, but it&rsquo;s also somewhat important to make that comparison less so as an existing iOS or Android user, and much more so as an existing Blackberry user who would consider this latest version when replacing their old phone.</p>
<p>All I wanna know: Is Instagram in their App Store?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>HAHA LOL, some hard core fan drilled me and said that it will be available on launch. Well&hellip;. that didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will ;) Most of the world won&rsquo;t see the device for another 2 months.</p>
<p>So is there a countdown timer somewhere that will let us all know when it&rsquo;s fashionable to use the term &ldquo;crackberry&rdquo; again?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that the Verge used -webkit-background-clip and -webkit-text-fill-color!! Cutting edge of web design!!! I wish more sites were proactive like you guys!</p>
<p>Wow, the review was a lot more positive than I expected (not to mention I didn&rsquo;t expect it today). Seems like a decent effort, but as Josh pointed out it doesn&rsquo;t seem to offer anything important over Android, iOS and even WP.</p>
<p>Former Blackberry users, is this a platform you could see yourself using?</p>
<p>As a current BB user (switch from Android January 2012), yes. If Microsoft or Android get a Blackberry Bridge like feature (the reason I switched), I would consider switching to them.</p>
<p>I just want to know the price for an unlocked device.</p>
<p>So you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and the view slides in from the side?  Intuitive!</p>
<p>Also: &ldquo;I was impressed with the typography&rdquo; is a pretty telling statement.  When you have to dig that far to find something to be impressed with&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not digging. That&rsquo;s the kind of stuff The Verge really pays attention to. Typography, pixel layouts, &ldquo;lagginess&rdquo;, the feel of the materials. They have certain things they like to nit pick.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>BB 10 gets the same ecosystem score with 70,000 apps (including lots of direct Android ports) that Windows Phone gets with 130,000?</p>
<p>Love the new BB, but The Verge&rsquo;s scoring system seems, shall we say, &ldquo;suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ecosystem score is going to take into several factors (quality of apps, future endorsement/investment by developers that&rsquo;s been promised/reliability/performance etc). Not just the exact number available.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be thick all your life.</p>
<p>Okay&hellip;.so Windows Phone still leads in every one of those areas and has more apps, higher quality apps, and a more robust ecosystem outside of applications than BB10.</p>
<p>My thinking is that BB10&rsquo;s ecosystem score at 5 is right where it should be. Windows Phone should be somewhere at 7 or 8 when you take into account the things like Office that no other competitor has.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has docs to go. Create and edit Word, Powerpoint, and Excel docs right on the device&hellip;</p>
<p>Docs to Go is a cute replacement, but it&rsquo;s not Office and doesn&rsquo;t have the baked-in cloud support  that is offered with SkyDrive on Windows Phone devices.</p>
<p>Fair enough. The device does have integration with Box and Dropbox though.</p>
<p>Quality of apps: a large proportion of BB 10&rsquo;s apps right now are Android apps running in an emulation environment.  That&rsquo;s a higher quality experience than native apps?  (And The Verge has evaluated the quality of all 70,000 BB 10 apps and 135,000 WP apps?  <span class="caps">REALLY</span>?!?)</p>
<p>Future endorsement/investment by developers: what&rsquo;s a <strong>concrete</strong> measurement of this?  Doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Reliability/Performance: Are you truly trying to argue that Android (which gets an &ldquo;8&rdquo; or &ldquo;9&rdquo;) is more reliable and higher performance than BB10 and WP8?  Seriously?</p>
<p>Not only that, Windows Phone has a true ecosystem around it: it integrates services and products we use daily, like Outlook/Hotmail, Skype, Office, XBOX. Blackberry doesn&rsquo;t. Yet it gets the same ecosystem score.</p>
<p>BB10 will sync with outlook, they announced skype, they have support for editing office docs. I don&rsquo;t know enough about how WP integrates with the xbox to really comment on that. The phone integrates with drop box, box, evernote, twitter, linked in, facebook, foursquare&hellip; It has most of the latest phone games. It has music, movies, and tv shows. I figure 5 aka &ldquo;equal to windows phone&rdquo; is a fair score.</p>
<p>I disagree.  It&rsquo;s a completely meaningless rating, frankly.</p>
<p>Nothing here that makes me want to buy this phone.</p>
<p>Sorry Blackberry, you had your chance.</p>
<p>The UI looks nice, for one.</p>
<p>All the top modern phone OS&rsquo;s have nice looking UIs, what&rsquo;s your point?</p>
<p>What can this phone do that the others can&rsquo;t? What can it do better? And what good is a nice looking UI, if its flawed in its implementation?</p>
<p>Used Android lately?</p>
<p>Not only does the UI not <span class="caps">LOOK</span> nice, it doesn&rsquo;t <span class="caps">WORK</span> very nicely either.</p>
<p>had? It has been one day&hellip;</p>
<p>When android did not have a &ldquo;siri competitor&rdquo; they would taunt that, now ther is no metion of lack of a siri competitor, funny who they forget such important things and call themselves tech journalists&hellip;.</p>
<p>I thought BB10 had at least voice recognition; not sure how it compares to Now or Siri.</p>
<p>It does have voice control support. There is a ton of stuff missing from this review (media playback, voice controls, universal search, pc syncing), but all the major things are covered. I think it is a positive thing that there aren&rsquo;t any bits about how major functionality is missing.</p>
<p>as many note, there is obvious inconsistency among the various Verge reviews&rsquo; Breakdown scoring of smartphone models. they just don&rsquo;t make sense compared with each other. the Verge needs to go back and re-score them all now that the Big Four are all available for simultaneous evaluation by, presumably, the same standards. iPhone 5, Lumia 820, Samsung S3, BB Z10.</p>
<p>They have talked about the scores before. The scores are pretty much a subjective measure vs comparable devices that are available and the reviewer&rsquo;s expectations. They won&rsquo;t be updating old scores. You shouldn&rsquo;t expect to be able to compare scores from now with a device from 2 years ago (or maybe even 1 year ago).</p>
<p>Sell these for $200 unlocked and usable on any carrier and these will move.  BB needs to understand that they are asking consumers to take a risk on them.  That needs to get baked into the cost of the unlocked phone.</p>
<p>Sell it for $200 and I&rsquo;ll bite.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t learn much from my business degree, but i did learn that anyone can sell &pound;10 for &pound;5. The trick is to turn &pound;10 into &pound;12. Its called adding value. The phone is worth more than $200 and should be priced accordingly.</p>
<p>Most likely it will even cost RIM more than $200 unlocked. At the $200 price point you find devices like the Lumia 620.</p>
<p>So my question, is it better then Windows Phone?</p>
<p>Or in other words&hellip;..will RIM be a distant 3rd?</p>
<p>IMO Windows Phone is better<br />
1. Cheaper<br />
2. OOB experience is very nice<br />
3. Awesome differentiated hardware</p>
<p>Yep, I know the BB for life guys will buy into this platform, but this is essentially an Android/iOS/WP8 retread UI with some weird UI navigation decisions, less apps than Windows Phone and some uninspiring hardware.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/blackberry-10-does-windows-phone-have-something-fear?utm_source=wpc&utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">http://www.wpcentral.com/blackberry-10-does-windows-phone-have-something-fear?utm_source=wpc&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a></p>
<p>The UI certainly looks better.</p>
<p>No just no</p>
<p>Wallpaper please!</p>
<p>life support.</p>
<p>Impressions after reading the review:</p>
<p>1- the visual design is wayyy overloaded. They seem to splash color randomly everywhere.</p>
<p>2- the UI seems complicated and different for the sake of it. Maybe I&rsquo;m too entrenched in Android&rsquo;s way of doing things. There seem to be useless complications at every turn.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s supposed to make people want to switch to BB10.</p>
<p>I have a weird feeling that this phone will sell relatively well. Maybe even better than competitive WP8 flagships.</p>
<p>I think the biggest miss from today&rsquo;s BB10 announcement is that battery life on their new flagship Z10 is apparently below average at best.  Battery life has always been a major plus of BlackBerry phones, and if they really wanted to stand out against iOS and Android, they should&rsquo;ve revolutionized in that area.</p>
<p>I agree.  Although iOS generally has OK battery life, the hardware has gone backwards since the iPhone 4 (which IMO had the best battery life for an iPhone).  Android has its stars, but for the most part is known to have handsets that don&rsquo;t make through a day or just barely.  BB could have knocked everyones socks off with a handset that could go 3+ days between charges.  I think that would be a major feature that would help them sell.</p>
<p>If this is true what Josh reported and the review it still lasts longer than my Samsung Omnia 7 (WP7).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like you didn&rsquo;t even try to play World of Goo.</p>
<p>RIM/BlackBerry should drop BB10 and switch over to Ubuntu. They would have a better chance of surviving and be different in a good way. WebOS is way more intuitive and polished than BB10.</p>
<p>Josh should give Blackberry 10 a break, IOS and Android at launch wasn&rsquo;t perfect. I think he&rsquo;s being too hard.. and no i&rsquo;m not a BB fanboy. Ive been using Droid since gingerbread up to 4.2.1.</p>
<p>BB10 has the same issue WP does in that like it or not, it is competing against Android and iOS.  Its hard to ignore where it does fall short when compared to its peers.</p>
<p>The choice of ecosystems and devices available today is quite different from what was available when iOS and Android launched. He is comparing BB10 with what&rsquo;s available today. A score of 7 is quite good for a reboot.</p>
<p>iOS was still a lot better than the competitors and Android was moving into a weak market.</p>
<p>This market is highly competitive, which is why it is far less relevant how iOS/Android was viewed at launch vs BB.</p>
<p>Yes Josh was harsh. Because of high (meaning unreasonable expectations). I( would rate the Z10 as 8.5/10) within the league of the superphones out there. Since you have 4.2.1, you know it trashes IOS6 on every feature except maybe speed in gpu games. So JB 4.2.1 is the real top OS no matter what Apple fanboys claim. A Jailbreak <span class="caps">IOS</span> 6.1 with serious tweaks could possibly match it but that might not be legal in the US.</p>
<p>At first the hardware looked nice from the few blurry pictures that were floating around the web, very iPhone 5 like in terms of design, then he pulled the cheap flimsy plastic back off the device and then the close ups really do show it&rsquo;s really just the usual cheap plasticky crap that falls to bits after the first few months. The operating system is a big &lsquo;meh&rsquo; as far as I&rsquo;m concerned as well.</p>
<p>Dude if your iPhone is unprotected by a sturdy case and you drop it 3 feet down to a concrete surface, guess what damage you will get ?!. There goes your $250 or more. You drop this and pieces fall off and battery comes apart, you put it together and it probably works!. That is the difference. The OS features are way advance of other mobile OSes, soon some native apps will be very compelling on BB10. One has to spend a few weeks to get into the guts of the system.</p>
<p>omg.</p>
<p>One of my tweets is featured in this video review.</p>
<p>SOMEBODY HOLD ME.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The curved corners of the slabs share an almost identical <strong>circumference</strong>,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe &ldquo;radius&rdquo; would be the appropriate word.</p>
<p>Does BB10 support active sync?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Did I just hear Josh saying he likes a product that is not from Apple? I must be dreaming&hellip;</p>
<p>He said something nice about an Apple product and so therefore he must hate all things not Apple?  Is that logical?  Why do you think that way?</p>
<p>Read his other reviews.</p>
<p>He personally uses an android phone &ndash; a nexus i think.</p>
<p>the only cool feature i saw was screen sharing other than that android and ios both pwn it.</p>
<p>For me the biggest deal breaker is the battery life.  I hope it is just an issue with the review unit or BlackBerry can fix it with an update.  The rest of the issues are minor in that they can all be chalked up as v1.0 bugs (as said in the review).</p>
<p>Not sure if mentioned before there is NO push email support for BB10 , not sure if users will like that.</p>
<p>Really? That&rsquo;s bad</p>
<p>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t like that.  I thought that BB was king of Push with their whole infrastructure and what have you&hellip;. ?  But isn&rsquo;t this something that can be addressed with a software update?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t spread FUD with your 4 comments total account. This is about gmail and impacts more than BB.</p>
<p>A bit of info from the <a href="http://crackberry.com/blackberry-z10-review">review</a> on crackberry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gmail, Windows Live Mail, Yahoo!, IMAP, POP, CalDAV, and CardDAV are all supported in BlackBerry 10 e-mail. Setup is fairly automated thanks to the connection with BlackBerry Internet Service, which does some of the heavy lifting on setup. Most of on the CrackBerry team are Gmail users (and have Google Apps accounts). When you setup Gmail through the Hub, it&rsquo;ll be an IMAP connection by default (so sync time is 15 minutes at its fastest). To fix that, you need to go to Setup &gt; Accounts &gt; Advanced Setup to kick ActiveSync into gear. That worked well and will continue to work for paid Google Apps account subscribers, but it&rsquo;s getting phased out for new free Gmail user accounts (which is an unfortunate Google decision).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>BlackBerry is now using ActiveSync for the transport conduct for push email. We&rsquo;ve found overall the e-mail performance to be pretty good on ActiveSync (and two-way syncing to Gmail is definitely better than in the past on BlackBerry devices, which used a proprietary service that never worked quite right for consumers).</p>

<p>See this <a href="http://forums.crackberry.com/blackberry-10-os-f269/bb10-does-not-have-push-email-765401/index2.html">thread</a>. Seems what was written in the review excerpt I posted may be incorrect. In conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gmail supports IMAP IDLE/PUSH. There&rsquo;s no need for a dedicated Gmail app. Google dropping support for Activesync is irrelevant. &ndash; From <em>DenverRalphy</em> &rsquo;s post (2000+ posts on his handle).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Push email IS supported. Supported via IMAP and/or ActiveSync. Get out of here with that nonsense.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really think 12 hours of battery life is that bad. Heck, the iPhone lasts 10 hours and even that is acceptable.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;the iPhone lasts 10 hours&rdquo; it is suppose* to last 10 continuous hours of usage (as in &ldquo;screen on&rdquo; time in the Android universe).  My iPhone 5 can easily go past 20 hours of moderate usage.  The review indicates that this new BB can&rsquo;t make it through a day.  Meaning, it sucks battery even when it is suppose to be in a more-or-less standby mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>I seriously doubt the iPhone can do 10 continuous hours of usage.  That is just what Apple says.</li>
</ul>
<p>One review I read said this is due to a known issue.</p>
<p>Which definitely can be an issue with these review units.  The initial engadget review of the Nexus 4, for instance, stated that the battery life was pathetic.  They received a new unit and said that the battery life of that one was nominal with other android handsets.  Once I had franco&rsquo;s kernel installed I was getting phenomenal battery life with the Nexus 4.  Especially good stand-by time where it seemed like the battery hardly drained at all while the screen was off.</p>
<p>Not a bad start, but the thing I would be concerned about when looking at a BB10 device is if it will be around in a year if the platform doesn&rsquo;t take off.</p>
<p>One could argue the same for Windows Phone, but Microsoft has said that they are in it for the long haul with Windows Phone and they have the time, cash and resources to back that up. RIM&hellip;er&hellip;BlackBerry has stated that they are &ldquo;all in&rdquo; with BB10, but need to keep their options open (I&rsquo;m paraphrasing). RIM doesn&rsquo;t have a cash cow like Windows or Office to keep the revenue flowing while slowly building up market share.</p>
<p>Good luck BB, it&rsquo;s not going to be easy.</p>
<p>This phone, and BB10, looks very promising. But if it can&rsquo;t set itself apart from the competition in any meaningful way, then it&rsquo;s DOA. iOS and Android have had lots of time to mature and become dominant, and the only way to get someone to switch over is to provide something truly compelling, which i dont think BB has at the moment.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>says Mr. Topolsky &ndash; an honest review. Looking forward to trying it out myself!</p>
<p>This is a really good start! And neither Android, iOS or WP were that good on release&hellip;</p>
<p>The hardware is beautiful, some interesting gestures&hellip;.but the software is so fugly, definitely the ugliest phone OS right now.</p>
<p>Ecosystem. score should be 4. Its not better than WP8</p>
<p>Happy I went with windows phone 8 insteead of waiting for BB10</p>
<p>I think I want this phone. I&rsquo;m really sick of android fragmentation and, I don&rsquo;t use widgets all often. I would to know when it is coming to AT&amp;T that way I can buy it. Also the evernote integration is AMAZING!!! I love evernote so much and use it religiously.</p>
<p>Maybe I wont buy it, I just really want a new phone and am tired of waiting to get one. Why can&rsquo;t MWC get here sooner?</p>
<p>It actually looks to be pretty smooth and fluid. Android needs to work on their fluid was (it is rumored they are as project butter just didn&#8217;t seem to cut it on vanilla of skinned). iOS has always been fluid, Windows phone 8 is surprisingly very fluid on my 8X (and trophy I had last year), and now BB10 looks to be. Your turn Google</p>
<p>Wow.  According to this review.  I have re evaluated which OS represents a Hot Mess.   &rarr; BB10</p>
<p>This looks really solid. The hardware and OS look fantastic. Judging from the review there definitely needs to be some refinements to the OS but based of off this fresh start, BB10 has a lot of potential.</p>
<p>The OS itself already looks way more attractive and intuitive than WP8.</p>
<p>Seriously? 8 Apps on the &ldquo;tile based screen&rdquo; cough &hellip; open 9th and boom, go fish in your &ldquo;app draw&rdquo; that looks like the bastard child of iOS and Android &hellip; wtf. Its horrible. Get a message &hellip; open a page with <span class="caps">ALL</span> your notifications from everything you have signed into. Then slide across and then try and figure out where the message came from? Intuitive? No, its balls. It looks just like an 3 year old iPhone with an epilepsy inducing OS.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m more concerned with where I can get that sweet background.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s such a big barrier to entry in that market because of the Ecosystems. Hope this succeeds though. We need competition between OSs.</p>
<p>Just looks like Android and iOS put together&hellip;</p>
<p>with a bit of windows phone. i like the look of BB10. it incorporates all of the OSes into one &ldquo;super OS&rdquo;</p>
<p>I want that screen on an Android phone&hellip;.</p>
<p>Lockscreen? Yes I agree</p>
<p>No, I meant the 720p 4.2" panel.  It&rsquo;s a perfect size and nicely high-res.</p>
<p>this looks like such a nice OS!!</p>
<p>I love how Josh was choosing his words very carefully at the end of the video, probably because he knows anything bad he says about Blackberry will be almost a death sentence.</p>
<p>Based on this review and others, it seems RIM has made a Blackberry for BB lovers. I was expecting a BB that would tempt IOS and android fans, perhaps BB11.</p>
<p>Any phone looks great with the BEAUTIFUL Verge wallpaper.</p>
<p>The Verge wallpaper is actually Simon C. Page&rsquo;s wallpaper:<br /><a href="http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/2012/03/ipad-hd-retina-wallpaper">http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/2012/03/ipad-hd-retina-wallpaper</a></p>
<p>Killer feature?</p>
<p>I already see one, the little flashing light warning me I&rsquo;ve got mail. All smartphones should have that now.</p>
<p>Great and balanced review of the z10. Time will tell if your review is true but it sure seems like it is having never touched the device. I had been a long time BlackBerry user until recently. Honestly it looks like an android phone with a skin on it. Like sense or touch whiz.</p>
<p>I do have one pressing question about it.</p>
<p>The main thing I miss about blackberry is the speed. Speed in communication mainly. The time it takes to make a phone call or return an email is quick and quite satisfying. Do you see this in bb10? Have they gotten over the touch screen problems where you have to unlock and tap tap tap tap tap to make a call? If they have in sold.</p>
<p>Lol what am I saying you don&#8217;t actually read the these comments so never mind.</p>
<p>They should have introduced the Q10 first instead of the Z10. Whenever I think of BlackBerry slab phones I think of that horrible clicking screen.  I would think the real hardcore BlackBerry fanboys would like the hardware keyboard better.</p>
<p>RIP RIM. It was a blast while it lasted.</p>
<p>Handsome looking device, but I believe it&rsquo;s too late for the company formerly known as RIM</p>
<p>RIM in 2007: &ldquo;Har har har, iPhone?! Who thinks that thing is going to take off! We&rsquo;ll just keep making our keyboard phones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>RIM in 2008: &ldquo;Har har har, Android?! Who thinks that thing is going to take off! We&rsquo;ll just keep making our keyboard phones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>BB in 2013: &ldquo;Maybe they were on to something back then, but we totally have caught up to at least a few years ago now&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>BB in 2020: * crickets *</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most notable feature of BlackBerry&rsquo;s new camera suite is its TimeShift mode, which functions as a kind of burst shooting mode, and can capture a handful of snaps of the same scene in a short amount of time (about the time you typically take to focus and shoot). Furthermore, the camera detects faces, allowing you to zero in on particular expressions for a shot and then select those frames for your final product.</p>
<p>The novelty works well and actually seemed to produce slightly better results than the average snap-and-pray approach, though I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced it makes the camera on the Z10 any more useful than an iPhone or decent Android shooter. Still, it&rsquo;s good to see someone trying to do something new, and I&rsquo;m sure people will find creative uses for the functionality."</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Nokia has the same time-shifting camera features in Lumia&rsquo;s already long ago after acquiring Scalado. Fix it mister reviewer.</p>
<p>Please provide a detailed comparison of the respective implementations so as to back up your claim. Being based on Scalado tech doesn&rsquo;t make it identical necessarily.</p>
<p>It takes multiple Images and then allows you to flip through the Images overall, then the faces and also in it&rsquo;s latest Installation allows you to remove people that happened to be strolling through your picture.</p>
<p>In that way it does even more than what the BB Camera App does.</p>
<p>Removing unwanted people from the shots is a really nice feature! I wonder if BB will add something like that down the road, and what&rsquo;s the impact of the Nokia ownership of Scalado on future developments and the licensing.</p>
<p>I note BB10 also has a <a href="http://demos.blackberry.com/blackberry-z10/na/us/gen/how-to/Media/Pictures/Picture-Editor/index.html">picture editor</a> built-in, with crop capabilities and stuff similar to Styles. There&rsquo;s also, as alluded to in the review, that <a href="http://demos.blackberry.com/blackberry-z10/na/us/gen/how-to/Media/Movie-Creation/BlackBerry-Story-Maker/index.html">Story Maker</a> app, which handles photos too. I just took a look at the Cinemagraph feature on WP, and Photosynth &ndash; and that&rsquo;s real fun stuff too! I also know of the Nokia WP phones low light capabilities, which are second to none&hellip;</p>
<p>My opinion is that WP is more focused on raw features, whereas BB chose to focus on personalizing and content creation/sharing.</p>
<p>WP is very much across personalsing and content creation/sharing. Its excellent at it too.</p>
<p>Note to Josh on the video portion of the review &hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an American company, therefore there is no such thing as the Blackberry &ldquo;Zee&rdquo; 10.  It&rsquo;s pronounced like the rest of the world pronounces it Blackberry &ldquo;Zed&rdquo; 10.</p>
<p>What other letters in English are pronounced that way?</p>
<p>C is &ldquo;Cee&rdquo; not &ldquo;Ced&rdquo;<br />
D is &ldquo;Dee&rdquo; not &ldquo;Ded&rdquo;<br />
T is &ldquo;Tee&rdquo; not &ldquo;Ted&rdquo;<br />
etc&hellip;.<br />NONE</p>
<p>Why is &ldquo;Zed&rdquo; different? Not trolling, just curious, is it &ldquo;Zed&rdquo; in Greek or Latin or something??</p>
<p>Answered my own question:</p>
<p><a href="http://grammarist.com/usage/zee-zed/" target="_blank">http://grammarist.com/usage/zee-zed/</a></p>
<p>Answered my own question:</p>
<p><a href="http://grammarist.com/usage/zee-zed/" target="_blank">http://grammarist.com/usage/zee-zed/</a></p>
<p>BlackBerry said it will be pronounced &ldquo;Zee 10&rdquo; in America. Americans see Z10 and think &ldquo;Zee 10&rdquo;. Everyone else gets the &ldquo;Zed 10&rdquo;. Simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackberry says they&rsquo;ll have 70,000 third party apps at launch but it feels like 69,000 of them will be bad&rdquo;</p>
<p>LMAO!! That was the best part of this entire review and he said it so nonchalantly. I can just see blackberry after listening to that part like <br /><img title="Poor Blackberry" src="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/003/617/okayguy.jpg" alt="Poor Blackberry" /></p>
<p>A bit harsh, but it&rsquo;s probably true. Probably true for other platforms too, but to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>BORIS!</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>Is topolsky a Boris fan? I want to believe!</p>
<p>I believe!</p>
<p>that dev alpha b model was a good looking unit I thought</p>
<p>Better than I expected, but what is even the point of launching a new OS in 2013? It&rsquo;s iOS, Android, or go home unless you have something really insane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem with the Z10 is that it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily do anything better than any of its competition.</p>
<p>I can see that, and it&rsquo;s also the way I feel about Windows Phone: nice OS, but doesn&rsquo;t do anything dramatically different enough, or better, to make users switch platforms.</p>
<p>(In fact, I&rsquo;ve found that media/music playback on WP, is kind of half-assed, don&rsquo;t know about the Z10 but would love to play with one).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stick to iOS and iPhone, but thanks.</p>
<p>Blackberry 10 looks like a really nice Android skin, doesn&rsquo;t it? I mean no offense when I say it but, it kind of does. Looks good!</p>
<p>This is possibly my next.</p>
<p>After the Playbook fiasco, I was really hoping that RIM would wholesale-copy WebOS and put a modern sheen on it.  From the looks of it, this is not the case.  No cards.  No great notification center (at the bottom!).</p>
<p>C&rsquo;est la vie.</p>
<p>I like the look of the Z10.</p>
<p>But I will wait till either Apple updates their iphone or Nokia updates their WP8 offering before I buy my next smartphone.  I have a feeling that Nokia will be introducing a iPhone5 &ldquo;look alike&rdquo; like Blackberry has done with the Z10.   I think Windows will eventually dominant the OS for smartphones!  This is my opinion; so no personal attacks please!  ha! ha!</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning here that the design of this phone was originally leaked before the iPhone 5 was even on the radar.</p>
<p>What a great review of a Blackberry device, and a great comments section full of arguments about Windows phone notifications. Congratulations internet.</p>
<p>Could someone please explain to me or tell me why the BB Z10 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for the US and Canada markets, while the International markets model gets a TI OMAP 4?</p>
<p>Why does any phone in general have different processors in different markets?</p>
<p>Different chipsets supports different networks (LTE, HSPA, etc.) at different frequencies I think.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s with the wallpaper always being the same?</p>
<p>Have you ever seen Home Alone? It&rsquo;s like when Marv leaves the water running as a calling card so he and Harry can be known as the &ldquo;Wet Bandits&rdquo;. The wallpaper is something to help make The Verge&rsquo;s reviews unique.</p>
<p>Anyone know what that pipe game was called!???</p>
<p>Answered my own question&hellip;.. World of Goo</p>
<p>It is disappointing to hear that the battery life could use an improvement.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to see the justification for the score on the camera. From what Josh wrote, it doesn&rsquo;t read like it should be a 7 if it has a pink blotch, focusing issues and washed out colours. Maybe he was too taken in by the burst mode gimmick. I feel like a 7 puts it too close to superior cameras such as what can be found on the Lumia 920, iPhone 5 and GS3 from what I&rsquo;ve seen on Gizmodo, Crackberry and WPCentral.</p>
<p>Adreno 225? Seriously? Even Adreno 320 is old.</p>
<p><img title="Fail GPU" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3659965/gifs/oh-come-on-gif.gif" alt="Fail GPU" /></p>
<p>This phone will succeed. I am a 13 year old who goes to school. The kids at school are pretty hyped for this. I think that if you can get children to be hyped about a product, than the product as a whole will succeed.</p>
<p>Backers of Blackberry will love this phone.</p>
<p>Children get hyped with just about every toy.</p>
<p>Where can I get that wallpaper again?</p>
<p>Google &ldquo;Joshua Topolsky wallpaper&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll get the answer.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>That is a generous score.</p>
<p>How long will it take BB10 to pass WP in users?</p>
<p>Most likely forever, because if we put this unit against a real WP8 device such as the Lumia 920. This device will lose and that wont even be a real challenge. To start of RIM should focus on the clear lag that can be seen in BB10 the second to put it on par would be to improve its hardware, not to copy it. Copy cat games with Apple usually ends up in the court room.</p>
<p>I am guessing it will take about 6 months to a year. Just going to ignore the rest of what you said.</p>
<p>It was a really nice round-up for the device, for once it was made focusing on the reviewed unit &ldquo;This is the Z10&rdquo; not &ldquo;This is the Z10 vs. Everyone else&rdquo;. However what ive been able to see about BB10 is that it&rsquo;s kind of bad mix of good old MeeGo and iOS.</p>
<p>That combined with a mediacore camera and with a bad battery, design that was clearly stolen straight from the iPhone. Screen seems to be good not anything like Droid DNA or Xperia Z but definetly good, and in the case of BB10 most likely better than a 1080p res fullHD screen which would kill the battery in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>Looks like Android.</p>
<p>Fair review.</p>
<p>You guys gotta be kidding me. Android fans vs Windows Phone fans vs iOS in every article related to smartphone or mobile OS.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dang right, true!  It&rsquo;s pathetic. Most people can only afford one phone at a time, and it&rsquo;s their right to choose what ever make the want. We can&rsquo;t all be walking around with the same model. That&rsquo;d be robotic&hellip;</p>
<p>It looks like a decent first stab from BB, some rather glaring holes in basic usability that would keep away from this iteration of the OS, but with some tweaking I could be tempted.</p>
<p>I Think its to early to tell how BB10 going. Wait for six month and then see.</p>
<p>Look, I know I&rsquo;m beating a dead horse here but how can the App ecosystem already be a 5 when WP only just got there? Considering your description of the App situation in the review, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like it&rsquo;s on par. I enjoy your reviews, Josh, but there&rsquo;s a reason the Microsoft crowd don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re entirely fair. Word prediction above the keyboard is also in WP but I don&rsquo;t recall it ever being mentioned. To be honest, dropping the scoring system entirely may well be worth considering. The review texts tend to be excellent and give a very good impression of a device&rsquo;s strengths and limitations. When I bought my 920, I knew what I was getting into thanks to The Verge and pretty much everything you wrote was bang on the money. I feel the scoring does nothing but muddy the waters.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re actually reading this (number of comments suggests you probably aren&rsquo;t): I imagine you meant a complement of feeds etc. &ndash; not a compliment.</p>
<p>RIM still has a pulse!</p>
<p>Good Job on the review! Thanks for the quality read!</p>
<p>Looks like a very nicely done phone from Blackberry/RIM. I just can&rsquo;t get interested in &lsquo;smart&rsquo; phones/pocket computers. Now, if someone came/comes out with an Ohio Scientific C4P-MF emulator&hellip;. hehe.</p>
<p>If this product fails then, Blackberry and RIM will no longer exist. They better be praying it works, I doubt people will switch from android or iOS for Blackberry, so fingers crossed.But I have to admit the design isn&rsquo;t half bad it&rsquo;s a big step.</p>
<p>A good solid device.</p>
<p>Sede1998</p>
<p>What wallpaper is that on the phone? I&rsquo;ve seen it on the Nexus 4 as well&hellip; I like it.</p>
<p>no thanks. bad bad bad move of RIM</p>
<p>I like the fact that BlackBerry will release the phone on every major carrier in the world.  I wish Nokia would see the advantage in doing that</p>
<p>Most to lose from this: Windows Phone.</p>
<p>This looks a bit better thought out than WP, and the hardware is a little nicer, too.</p>
<p>Battery life is a bummer &ndash; but they all equally suck. iOS used to be great but then they added lots more features and now battery life is just as bad as on your random Android phone.</p>
<p>I just came back from traveling &ndash; my iPhone connected to local networks, often with bad connection, but I turned off data roaming, so no internet. And guess what after a full day of use &ndash; where I actually used Google Maps / GPS a lot, and took lots of pictures as well &ndash; I still had 80% battery. As soon as data is on, notifications start flowing, and whatever else the thing is doing, battery life drops like a rock.</p>
<p>Swipe up for homescreen should be mandatory on all phones. If only iOS had that!</p>
<p>Or hit the button or capacitive button at the bottom of all the other phones.  Instead of swiping from the bottom, just hit the button at the bottom.</p>
<p>Yes, the simplicity of what&rsquo;s been on iPhone since day one still works. I still wish they added a touch sensitive bezel and ditch the home button. The bezel might be used for a few simple gestures that might become universal, like app switching by swiping horizontally, return to homescreen by swiping vertically from bottom, and notification from top. All this just shows that we are still at the prehistory of computers and touch interfaces. In time, conventions will appear.</p>
<p>are they perhaps wasting their time with dev relations? wouldn&rsquo;t it be so easy to license an android emulation layer from google and automatically jump ahead of WP8 in the app race? day 0 winsauce.</p>
<p>i see some stumbling points in 10, but all of those could be addressed in OTA updates. you need to be able to pin apps to the widget/recent apps hybrid thingamajig.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a long time BlackBerry user, and I&rsquo;ve been saying all along (posting on CrackBerry of all places) that the Android player was a stupid ugly kludge.  Same goes with Adobe <span class="caps">AIR</span>.  HTML5 seems to run really nicely though (the BlackBerry 10 browser is HTML5).</p>
<p>I really like all the gestures.  Sure, there&rsquo;s a lot of them, and they&rsquo;re confusing at first.  But once you&rsquo;re past the learning curve it&rsquo;s really fast and fluid.  But then I use VI as a text editor so I&rsquo;m used to remembering a ton of different shortcuts.  The way I look at it, the more gestures/shortcuts there are in an interface, the faster it will be for you, eventually.</p>
<p>I wish they had given us 100-200 natively coded (c++/Cascades) top tier applications, and ignored all the chaff.  I&rsquo;m deeply disappointed by the app situation.</p>
<p>As far as the oddities in the interface, these things can be improved by software updates.  A couple examples:</p>
<p>1.  An improved lock screen with swipe to either (a) camera (b) hub root &copy; active frames (just like an Android lock screen) would be nice.</p>
<p>2.  The way the hub &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; where you were last time can be both useful (for going back and forth between an email and another application, and then back again) and annoying (when you go back to the hub for a new notification, only to find yourself inside a previous email).  You almost need two gestures to handle two different situations.</p>
<p>3.  No notification &ldquo;toasts&rdquo;.  I find this the most irritating shortcoming.  I use a third party application on my 9900 to give me these, and they&rsquo;re so incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">DOA</span>, but it&rsquo;s got a long way to go.  I just don&rsquo;t see them abandoning this stupid Android player garbage, and it just makes them look bad.  They should have concentrated on getting the top tier applications natively coded.</p>
<p>Nice review. I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with Blackberry 10 thus far and I think the word &ldquo;solid&rdquo; sums it up very well.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RIM</span>, I know you had been working long and hard developing software, there is a lot of time and money on it, but it is time to move along and get into the android ship. Remember Nokia? they were to stutter to abandon their long time succesfull symbian and then they got stucked with a very workable windows phone os when people already made up their minds between nice simple and stylish (ios) or rougue personalization and endurance (android). Hate to break it so many blackberry fans but whatsapp killed bbm and it makes sense that after such platform was so exclusive (only for bb), apps like whatsapp allowing different users from distinct os and even carriers across the world are throwing huge rocks at the last remaining competitive advantage <span class="caps">RIM</span> was getting left with&hellip; the looks real nice and with a lot of heart buy it looks yeasterday, coz as it happen with apple users, improving from 3.5 to 4.0 inch screens, 4.2 look such a nice big screen compared to the other RIM&rsquo;s attempts&hellip;</p>
<p>Windows Phone is a weak effort. There is still room for the legacy smartphone original that also supports enterprise, government and <span class="caps">EAS</span>.</p>
<p>The consumer market is more fickle. However, to RIM&rsquo;s credit, they have never produced cartoon toy devices (and it is is readily apparent in their design aesthetic)..</p>
<p>Smart phones for grownups&hellip;They just need smart software and app support. I would go back.</p>
<p>CP/M was the first widely adopted PC OS (aside from AppleOS. At the time, I looked at Apple but would have needed the Z80 softcard (to run CP/M). These things do change and evolve&hellip;judging from the last 30 years&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing is forever&hellip;</p>
<p>Z10 is a weak effort. Just look at the score. BB makes conservative devices for grandpas. Hardly anyone younger gets excited about them.</p>
<p>7/10 is not a weak score!</p>
<p>In England, if you get 70% or over in your degree, your degree is classed as a first!</p>
<p>Z10 is actually a good effort, but <span class="caps">RIM</span> has lost mind share (and they  have a crappy app store). But let&rsquo;s get real&hellip;WP8 is pure junk, from anyone coming from <span class="caps">IOS</span> or Android. Different s not better.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RIM</span> does appeal to grandpas (and grown-ups) because of the design aesthetic and features. However, iPhone is still an expanded iPod (consumer). Android is still a hack with Google services.</p>
<p><span class="caps">RIM</span> is  a moneymaker phone for corporate users&hellip; where they get/maintain contacts, calendar and email. This should be their (RIM&rsquo;s) &ldquo;play&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where can we order those Verge stickers? Also your review seemed a bit biased.</p>
<p>This is not a review. This is a joke Joshua. I read exactly same jokes at Engadget from you long time ago.  Same old same old .</p>
<p>it was a well thought out review, sounds like you just didnt like what he liked &ndash; which begs the question, why read a review if you&rsquo;re just looking for your own opinion?</p>
<p>All reviews are based on someone&rsquo;s option (unless you&rsquo;re reporting purely objective and quantifiable measures) and even though I might not agree with someone&rsquo;s conclusion I may still wish to read their review to get further insight into deatils I would otherwise be unable to investigate myself with the intention of formulating my own opinion.</p>
<p>How many people could tell you what their favorite car is without ever having driven it themselves?  And how much of that opinion would be based on reading other people&rsquo;s reviews telling the reader why it is (or is not) <em>their</em> favorite car versus first hand experience?</p>
<p>Everyone has a right to an opinion and no-one&rsquo;s is right or wrong.</p>
<p>No it wasn&rsquo;t. I can read just Headline with Joshua name under and know it&rsquo;s going to be 7/10. <br />
He is so predictable , it&rsquo;s not even funny anymore. Same old, same old.</p>
<p>I think it shows what a failure the z10 will be. Literally no one is talking about it, 90% of the comments are about WP8, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>I noticed the same thing.</p>
<p>If the number of (astroturfing) fanboys writing comments here would translate to device sales the Lumia 920 would have 90% market share.</p>
<p>The more people who don&rsquo;t care for Apple can avoid having to settle for Android the better off the world is.  So I personally welcome new Android alternatives.  Looks great to boot.</p>
<p>This has been sort of on my mind since reading it. I&rsquo;ve read a few other reviews since. This one is actually among the most negative. Even so, I think some of the key criticisms Josh made are quite valid. The multi-tasking screen definitely needs work. Just being able to pin a few apps to it would solve many of its issues, if it&rsquo;s to be used as a widget screen as well. The notification/hub thing also needs some polish. But, I do think the idea itself is a good one. I&rsquo;d have to play with it to comment on the gestures. The battery life is a pretty big deal, though. Hopefully that can be fixed with a software update.</p>
<p>That said, this is a much, much more solid effort than I was expecting. I&rsquo;ve never owned a Blackberry. I&rsquo;m very happy with my iPhone and I have no intention of giving it up. But, I still want to see this succeed. I can&rsquo;t apply my own preferences to an entire market. I can see a lot of people picking one of these up. Hopefully I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Akuma No Uta&#8221; is such a solid album.</p>
<p>Looks fine, but I have to agree that it doesn&rsquo;t do anything that would make it a &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; device.</p>
<p>I feel like this is definitely a step in the right direction for BlackBerry.  Hopefully they make it back into the market with surprises.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe, that <span class="caps">RIM</span>/BlackBerry will strikes back.</p>
<p>I was a die-hard Blackberry freak for many, many years.. I&rsquo;ve been without one now for a year and a half. the biggest reason I didn&rsquo;t get another last go-round was that my eyesight is failing terribly and I thought I needed a larger screen&hellip; I have the <span class="caps">HTC</span> Sensation  and an iPhone 4S. Everyday I tell someone that I still miss my Blackberry! I simply cannot wait to get my hands on the Z10 and will do just about anything to do so.</p>
<p>Hooray Blackberry! I have so missed you and hope you make it, I&rsquo;ve barely been able to live without you&hellip;</p>
<p>Hello guys .. and girls.</p>
<p>I felt that this review missed out some of the most important feature / aspect of the new <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> 10. It left out why there is a BB10 today. Well, very simple, because there is a demand for it.</p>
<p>However different the new BB10 UI is will not determine if the phone will sell or not, really it will not. It is the image of the brand that is doing all the selling. Allow me to share some real decision making environment.</p>
<p>1) When corporate companies decides to give company phones to their employees, most will not opt for an <span class="caps">IPHONE</span>. Do not be surprise that those employees will be given an old <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span>. Email efficiency, <span class="caps">BBM</span>, corporate image and the lack of game applications tops the reasons. Application such as <span class="caps">INSTAGRAM</span> or <span class="caps">FACEBOOK</span> or <span class="caps">YOUTUBE</span> is not a priority to this group, some even banned it</p>
<p>2) When government or the military sector wants to give phones to their staff, security of the phone is the the first thing in mind, followed by corporate image. And they spelled that phone &lsquo;b l a c k b e r r y&rsquo;. Again, application such as <span class="caps">INSTAGRAM</span> or <span class="caps">FACEBOOK</span> or <span class="caps">YOUTUBE</span> is not a priority to these group. Can you imagine walking into a government buildings and the staffs are busy updating their <span class="caps">INSTAGRAM</span> status?</p>
<p>3) Image of a persona. Working adults would like to project a corporate image. Tidy hair, nice tie, leather shoe, a power suit and of course a phone that suits that image.  That is either a <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> 10 or a <span class="caps">NOKIA</span> <span class="caps">LUMIA</span> 920.</p>
<p>4) In movies, the <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> is still very relevant. Anyone watched <span class="caps">PRETTY</span> <span class="caps">LITTLE</span> <span class="caps">LIARS</span> lately? Although this will group will not contribute much in terms of sales, but it helps promote the <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> brand. We will be seeing <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> 10 in movies pretty soon. Just to add, James Bond was using a Sony Experia in <span class="caps">SKYFALL</span>, because that phone is deem a cool gadget, rather than a smartphone. To further, Sony experia gets cooler now, it is water resistant.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> 10 is not for the average user. It is the best choice of smartphone for work. One cannot argue that. The way I see it, people with <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> 10 will probably have another phone for their personal entertainment fix.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that my company will be placing orders for the <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> 10. Am I excited? No, it is just a phone, not a car.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a crappy phone but you are right.</p>
<p>Oh no! Widgets.<br />
/s</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stick with my iPhone 5, thanks. Not compelling.</p>

<p>Not interesting not exiting and much compromised too &lsquo;late for the party&rsquo; product which nobody wants to have. Although It is still could be good enough for &lsquo;corporate America&rsquo; ( they didn&rsquo;t need much in there ;)), but for normal people its too expensive too ugly and too useless ;)</p>
<p>A lot of commentators and reviewers are saying that it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;better&rdquo; than iOS or Android and think that is a negative. I think that&rsquo;s the wrong way to look at it.</p>
<p>Right now we have reached a level of maturity with smart phones. They all pretty much do the same things and we have conventions like swiping or tiled app icons that most people are familiar with. You cant radically change these things now, too many people know them. Windows Phone has suffered because it&rsquo;s tried to move away from the convention that&rsquo;s been established in terms of user interface and device operation. In short, people just get confused with new things.</p>
<p>In that light, Blackberry have done the only thing they can do. Give the people what they know with a little twist. When your aveage joe see the screens on BB10 they are not gonna freak out. They&rsquo;ll just think iits similar to their iphone or android. They wont put a judgement on it in the same wat people do with Windows Phone or any other non standard UI.</p>
<p>I think the bb10 gets them in the conversation. They also have the brand. No one is going to feel bad about owning one of these things. I think thats a big deal and a big accomplishment given how much time they have lost.</p>
<p>I like what I&rsquo;ve seen of the BB10 so far and I think some of what was said in the latest Vergecast was short sighted. Take the comment about the design being too similar to the iPhone and not different enough &ndash; had it been completely different, it would have been criticised for not being like an iPhone, for not being familiar, for being too different, etc. I&rsquo;ve been an iPhone user from day one but I&rsquo;m hungry for something different and after picking up and enjoying a Nexus 7 then I might be tempted to try the new Blackberry as well.</p>
<p>I think this situation is covered by the Pareto principle, which essentially says that for any given phenomena 80% is contributed by a couple key players, and the remaining 20% covers the contribution of all the rest.  Using colas as an example, Coke and Pepsi likely account for 80% of all cola sales, but you only need to take a walk down the pop aisle in any grocery store to see that the other 20% still allows for many other players to make a profit.  Same with cars; while Toyota and GM are the sales leaders, there is still a lot of room for all the other car companies.  To say there isn&rsquo;t room for a fourth, fifth, sixth player in the mobile handset space is a bit myopic &ndash; especially considering that much of what people use their mobiles for is becoming platform-independent thanks to web apps and web standards.</p>
<p>There is room for both Windows Phone and BB10 in the mobile space.  And if there isn&rsquo;t, I think the smart money would be on Blackberry anyway.  Even if only half the people currently using BB phones bought a BB for their next device, that user base would still greatly dwarf WP8 but several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>I think in the end it&rsquo;ll come down to just how many people think that BB deserves another chance.</p>

<p>Well &hellip; <span class="caps">BETTER</span> <span class="caps">LATE</span> <span class="caps">THEN</span> <span class="caps">NEVER</span>.</p>
<p>Nice article about a smartphone I&#8217;d love to see in action (unlikely to be getting one as recently availed myself of the Nexus 4). I hope the Z10 does revive BlackBerry&#8217;s fortunes, it&#8217;s handsomely packaged.</p>
<p>On a separate note &#8211; Bryter Later. Someone has exceptional taste in music &#8230;</p>
<p>Outside of the tech blog bubble, Apple mind share is fading. Consumers, rightly or wrongly are looking at iPhone with new eyes. They&rsquo;re now noticing that it is not a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; device (it never was). Android is still a fragmented solution and OEMs still differentiate. It is not a common end user experience.Windows Phone 8, <span class="caps">IMO</span>, is a quick and dirty mash up of consumer and business use cases. I find it jarring and have no patience for it, coming from years of original BB, iPhone and Android devices</p>
<p>There is still a window of opportunity for <span class="caps">RIM</span> (a la BlackBerry), especially in the enterprise/gov markets. Enterprise runs on Windows on the client side and the mobile worker needs access to enterprise via a mobile client.MS won&rsquo;t get this right for another few major releases (wait for 3.0 :-)).</p>
<p>Most large enterprise operations ran and administered  their own BB servers. <span class="caps">RIM</span> should be focusing as much on the back end as it is on new touch-centric clients.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to why security is not seen as a compelling reason to choose this OS. It is clearly the best, with its <span class="caps">FIPS</span> compliance.<br />
Don&rsquo;t you think that as people use their smartphones and tablets more and more in place of their laptops, doing things like paying bills and buying things online, security will become more and more important?</p>
<p>Ok, so he said about the iPhone 5&rsquo;s battery: " though the meter was often near zero when I placed the phone back on the charger in the evening" and gave it a 9. Now, he&rsquo;s basically saying the same thing about the Z10&rsquo;s battery (&ldquo;If I took the phone off of the charger around eight or nine in the morning, by six or seven at night the phone was completely dead&rdquo;) but gave it a 5 instead?</p>
<p>And also, he said the Z10 looks very much like the iPhone 5, but gave it a 7, as opposed to a 9 for the iPhone. Talk about bias.</p>
<p>yeah i gotta agree with you. The whole battery thing is BS. The battery on this phone is quite solid after a couple days use. but even if it was as bad as they said&hellip;it should get the same as the iphone 5&rsquo;s rating.</p>
<p>He took the android apps feature to the wood shed, and after owning this device for a bit here, i honestly have to disagree..apps like songza which are ported..work awesome. Yes i am sure there are shitty ones if you search to find one&hellip;..but its not fair to bash it on that standard. really really unfair. This device is at least a 8-8.5/10 if Josh was leaving his bias at home. For a 1.0 OS this phone is outstanding&hellip;..</p>
<p>Good Luck BB10, you, well, you&rsquo;re definately going to need it, you&rsquo;ve got an amazing uphill battle to fight. The OS is not impressing me as much anymore now that I&rsquo;ve seen it fleshed out.</p>
<p>Firstly, I think the 7 score posted is a little harsh. For BB, I think it should simply concentrate on what its users need, not what every TDHs want. Let &lsquo;Droid and iOS go battle for the consumer market. BB has done well in the corporate playing field and it should continue building on this. Seriously, how many apps do you really use? As what some biz sage mentioned, &rsquo;if you can&rsquo;t be #1, be the <span class="caps">ONLY</span> one&rsquo;. As seen, being #1 isn&rsquo;t all that great&hellip;it&rsquo;s remaining there.</p>
<p>I had been told that Josh would give a fair, unbiased opinion when reviewing devices. They must have been referring to someone else. I&rsquo;ve had the Z10 since it was released here on February 5th and I can&rsquo;t agree with any of the faults he has mentioned, with the exception of the maps. And let&rsquo;s face it, Google is the master of maps and will not be out done by anyone, anytime soon. If, after a weeks use, he still finds the Z10 confusing, then I think he should stick with the &ldquo;Caveman simple&rdquo; iPhone. I am amazed he didn&rsquo;t pickup on a very simple truth: the BlackBerry came to prominence via corporate and government use, and it should be plain for anyone to see that they are still the primary targeted audience for this device. In a world of <span class="caps">BYOD</span>, nothing comes close to the BlackBerry Z10, all the features that some say aren&rsquo;t compelling enough to win over the average consumer, are exactly what the large corporate and government users have been screaming for. So I guess it&rsquo;s a matter of perspective.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wJyrgoNt0c&feature=player_embedded">Here&rsquo;s the tip for the notification hub which is really good</a></p>
<p>Life support. Sadly the capabilities of this phone just aren&rsquo;t a match for the beasts that launched or are about to launch within mere weeks after this one. Blackberry just doesn&rsquo;t have the resources to wrestle with the 3 giant super-companies pitted against them in the arena.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m affraid that the Z10 and Q10 are the swan songs of BlackBerry. The mobile market currently is dominated by Apple and Google in such a way that BlackBerry almost can&rsquo;t hold up. Unless they adapt to the market, they will go down within the next few years.</p>
<p>I just really hope this succeeds because I think this<br />
 is a fresh approach to a mobile OS</p>
<p>The new update has increased the battery life by quite a bit. The Verge really does need a updated score box.</p>
<p>Funny how they all have more faith in BB10 than they did with WP7. It took years for all 4 carriers to jump on it while they all were on board before BB10 even is out.</p>
<p>You seem to be overlooking the fact that BlackBerry is an established Brand. Folks know blackberry, they already have die hard fans&#8230;.  WP had nothing coming out the gate&#8230; There was nothing memorable about Windows Mobile. That&#8217;s the difference.</p>
<p>RIM also has of a niche of corporate/government users</p>
<p>Not on the Gov&#8217;t side.  They announced over a year ago that iOS and Android devices were OK for official use.</p>
<p>Only in some departments. None that require secure connections.</p>
<p>And there are still Blackberries being used. Go figure.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he meant a monopoly in those markets, just that they had/have a market there still:</p>

<p>Yet they still deploy BlackBerry devices as the majority. Your point is moot</p>

It&#8217;s not a surprise that RIM added support to BES to allow companies to not only run BES, but allow BYOD just so they don&#8217;t lose BES revenue on top of phone revenue. <br />
<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/rim-forced-to-react-to-bring-your-own-devices-policies/" target="_blank">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/rim-forced-to-react-to-bring-your-own-devices-policies/</a><br />
If more and more companies starting running BES with support for Good for enterprise, and more and more companies start implementing BYOD policies, do you really think that market trends are going to work in RIMs favor?</p>
<p>Bravo! Your move TommesJay.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a BlackBerry Fan and I surely knew ALL articles you linked before. But how do you, based on those articles, want to paint the whole picture? Nobody knows the whole picture in enterprise, yet. You could post 50 linked articles in which global companies and departments abandoned their BlackBerrys and all these 50 companies together could account for 500.000 BlackBerrys. But there could still be, let&#8217;s say, 8.000.000 BlackBerrys left in enterprise and government use. All we really know, is, that there are 79 million BB users globally, but we don&#8217;t know how many of them are BIS-using consumers and how many are BES-using enterprise users. Analysts estimate this rate on 20:80 . So probably 15.8 million BES-connected enterprise and government used BlackBerrys are out there currently. Those stories of single companies you linked only show a small party of it all and lack any relation, but nonetheless people like you persist on stating that RIM has already lost its business and government users completely, simply based on gut instinct and articles like those above. Sorry, but that&#8217;s crap. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I won&#8217;t say everything is fine, there are for sure more and more companies which abandon their BBs, but we just can&#8217;t know yet how late it is. And when I give you a big, global figure, like I did it above, that 90 of Fortune 1,000 still use BBs (not only probably, but they use them) and that those enterprises upgrade to BB7 at a significant rate, based on mid July 2012, I think that has much more informative value for the whole picture, than your 10 single-company-stories.</p>
<p>To BYOD. RIM understood the BYOD problem and is going to handle it in different ways. First, BB10 devices will support ActiveSync and won&#8217;t inevitably need a BES-connection in enterprise use. Second, when connected to BES10, BlackBerry Balance on BB10 phones will offer the best experience for corporate phones ever. With its two completely separated profiles employees won&#8217;t have to compromise on any fun on their private profile, while the company won&#8217;t have to compromise on any security. That&#8217;s unique and perfect for BYOD. Thirdly, BlackBerrry Mobile Fusion makes it possible to handle iOS-, Android- and BlackBerry devices all centraziled in one console of the IT-department. Thats also perfect for BYOD. Not to forget that BB10 offers an experience in enterprise use, let&#8217;s say compared to iPhones or Droids with GOOD for enterprise installed, that&#8217;s lightyears ahead in terms of usability and convenience when it comes to PIM and messaging. GOOD is just poor against this. Not to mention the still unmatched security and administrative features of a BES-environment.</p>
<p>*90% of Fortune 1,000</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re a blackberry fan. That&#8217;s good, but here&#8217;s something you should know, I don&#8217;t hate you, I don&#8217;t hate blackberry, I don&#8217;t want the fall of RIM. So stop freaking out.</p>
<p>All those links I&#8217;ve posted and what I was saying in my previous post was that some companies, and lots of US govt agencies are ditching RIM. Is that bad in of itself? Nope. What&#8217;s worse for them, and what is something they finally had to respond to was BYOD. You gave me 3 examples of what YOU think RIM could do to make BB10 successful in a BYOD, but I don&#8217;t think a single one of your reasons had anything to do with what customers actually want.</p>
<p>Not meaning to step on your neck or anything, but do you know anyone that has ever been &#8220;issued&#8221; a BB for work, where they wish they could just use an iphone, and android phone , or something else, but were literally forced to use a BB. You gave me reasons; reasons ranging from the support of Activesync and multiple phone profiles, to the ease of use for IT departments managing multiple operating systems with blackberry fusion.</p>
<p>But not once did you address something that average people just want. My mom for example works for Kaiser. If an average non techie person like my mom, your mom, sister, brother dad etc were to pick a device in BYOD would they pick a BB10 device based on some of the reasons you mentioned, or would they be attracted to  Siri, Google Now, iMessage, gChat, Skype, Office,  Xbox Music, Xbox Live, Smart glass or some of the other features that have made other phones really cutting edge like being super thin, super big screens, awesome cameras, stylus support. There used to be one killer service that RIM had, BBM&#8230;but let&#8217;s be honest, people don&#8217;t talk about that or feel as attached to that as they did 3,4,5 years ago.</p>
<p>I see your point. iPhone took over business users by infiltrating the consumer market. Key thing here is: each business user is also a consumer after working hours. I know that. From a non-techie consumer perspective, the legacy BBOS is a pain in the ass. That&#8217;s where BB10 comes in. Of course the three points I mentioned only refer to IT decision makers in companies, but BB10 also aims at ease of use, multimedia and apps and this in a refreshing way by a new user experience. BB10 won&#8217;t be a pain in the ass for average consumer needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Siri, Google Now, iMessage, gChat, Skype, Office, Xbox Music, Xbox Live, Smart glass&#8221;</p>
<p>There WILL be a voice assistant, there WILL be instant messaging services beside BBM, there WILL be Skype (seems to been leaked), there WILL be mobile office software, there WILL be Skydrive and Dropbox, there WILL be Instagram, there WILL be a really good mapping and nav solution and at least content providers and a state-of-the-art web browser. And much more to come. I think your point is valid as it is the still the big question mark for BB10, but I think RIM is on the right track here.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;re point is that, BB10 will support all of these 3rd party platforms. How is that any different than iOS, Android and to a lesser extent Windows Phone (since it doesn&#8217;t have as many 3rd party hooks). What are the first party hooks that RIM has to offer that are genuinely compelling to not just make people choose BB10, but lure them back from competing OS? I watched the 6.5 min walkthrough video that was on gizmodo the other day. Neat stuff, but I don&#8217;t see any stuff there that is really compelling. And I think even Heinz himself has said they&#8217;re not really a first party services company in the way that Google or Microsoft are&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to argue on that. BB10 surely hasn&#8217;t any revolutionary features one might recognize on first glance within a video walkthrough. But I think the gesture navigation, peek, flow and hub might ne very compelling as soon as you actually spend hands-on time with it. And it&#8217;s fast, intuitive and convenient in every-day use. You say you&#8217;ve seen nothing revolutionary in the video(s) (like many others), but many people who spent hands-on time with stated that they were &#8216;blown away&#8217;. We&#8217;ll see. The first iPhone brought hardly any revolutionary functions to the table, it was even lacking well established things (MMS/Copy&amp;Paste/Multitasking/3G), but nonetheless it was compelling by its overall experience, intuitiveness and usability. So we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>On BYOD one more time.</p>
<p>The question is, WHY exactly do companies abandon their BlackBerrys and go BYOD. Most companies which did it, stated that the legacy BBOS doesn&#8217;t meet their requirements anymore in terms of performance and that their employees want phones that are easier to use and more untuitive. Moreover, BES is expensive. So they just don&#8217;t want to spend more money on an infrastructure that is behind the competition in terms of usability and performance. BUT IF BB10 phones offer an even better experience than iOS and Android do in terms of business and enterprise use and fulfill their requirements again including doubling down on security with BES10, maybe enterprises will prefer BB10 phones and a BYOD program plugged to a BES through BB Mobile Fusion. We can&#8217;t know yet. GOOD is definetely a compromise in terms of usability. One dedicated app for enterprise communications that isn&#8217;t integrated at all? That&#8217;s a joke and more like an emergency solution.</p>
<p>Haha, i think you&#8217;re grasping man. You think a company that goes from issued BBs only to BYOD would see BB10 and they tell people &#8220;sorry folks, we let you bring the handsets of your choosing before, but you have to use BBs again&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, that IT department would get death threats. You&#8217;re insane if you think that one you give people &#8217;&#8217;freedom&#8217;&#8217; you can just take it away w/out any problems. Employees are people not prison inmates or marines being issued standard issue socks and weapons.</p>
<p>My point is that a significant number of BYOD users will choose BB10 right on their own.</p>
<p>Based on&#8230;it going on sale around feb 28 (the first device) and being so much better than anything made by apple, any of the many android OEMs or any of the Windows Phone OEMs? I would ask you what makes you think that BB10 is going to be so revolutionary that it&#8217;s going to break the long running BB exodus trend, but I don&#8217;t honestly think i&#8217;ll be able to get a serious answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;we’ve recognized that in order to be completely relevant and expand our unfair share of the space, which despite of all the negative rhetoric in the press we do maintain presence in 90% of the Fortune 1000 companies, and they are upgrading at a significant rate to our BlackBerry 7 portfolio, but the key element to reinforce our position in the enterprise market is that we create a consumer attractive device that folks bring into the corporate environment in that BYOD case.&#8221;</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that is a niche.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft doesn&#8217;t have fans&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, even if it doesn&#8217;t appeal to Android or iOS users, it&#8217;s definitely gonna appeal to BlackBerry users. Plus, there&#8217;s loads of BlackBerry lovers who switched to Android or iOS and are closely monitoring BB10. I&#8217;m one of em :)</p>
<p>For people who are still using BB&#8217;s now, BB10 will probably be a godsend.</p>
<p>Its interesting how people distort history and get away with it . <br />
All the four major US carriers offered wp7 devices within the fair year of release.  They only got cold feet when it was proving to be a tough sell.  Just as they are doing now  they  all promised to offer wp7 during the windows phone launch.. Here is a quote.</p>
<blockquote>Partners from around the world have committed to include Windows Phone 7 Series in their portfolio plans. They include mobile operators AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom AG, Orange, SFR, Sprint, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telstra, T-Mobile USA, Verizon Wireless</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s because BB actually has a userbase (still).</p>
<p>Except he is lying.. Windows phones had all four carriers on board at launch .. And having a usebase  doesn&#8217;t mean anything.. Windows mobile had a user base when windows phone first launch but not everyone was moved over to windows phone  likewise the Nokia Symbian /wp7 .</p>
<p>Nokia&#8217;s Symbian users couldn&#8217;t accept shining dumbphone (WP7) as a successor for one of the most functional smartphone platforms at the time.</p>
<p>Totally true.</p>
<p>Remember that dumbphone OS iOS and what it did in a matter of a couple years? That dumbphone OS has continued to improve if you have noticed. It does a lot of things much faster and plesantly than Symbian could ever have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much faster&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly the point (for me) with Symbian. It was functional, but always too slow, too much steps for performing a task. That&#8217;s why I still use the legacy BBOS. It&#8217;s as functional as Symbian natively (if not even more) and it&#8217;s fast and convenient like hell in terms of usability (despite app downloads and upgrades).</p>
<p>because there was not a migration plan.</p>
<p>and symbian phone are STILL better than windows phone 8</p>
<p>if nokia 808 had 720p screen i would have one .</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;symbian phone are STILL better than windows phone 8&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Is heroin legal in your country by any chance?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. He defines &#8220;better&#8221; by native, PC-like functionality, you define it by eyecandy, touchscreen-smoothness, apps, games and web-browsing-capabilities.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d take Windows <strong>MOBILE</strong> 6 over Symbian for PC-like functionality. To call Symbian &#8220;PC-like&#8221; is an insult to PCs.</p>
<p>Sure. But as I said, Symbian&#8217;s already slow. And WinMob is the slowest OS (in usability) of all time.</p>
<p>RIM has the brand loyalty and BBM and will do well. Windows Phone does not have brand power of Blackberry. Even teenagers will take next Blackberry instead of Galaxy S3 and iPhones.<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/Nz66_WL77Yw" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/Nz66_WL77Yw</a></p>
<p>Funny how they have more faith in a more established brand that&#8217;s currently in third place. compared to a brand that&#8217;s has 2%.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how people seem to forget that BB is currently 3rd and has held on to 3rd place with a very old and outdated OS.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s cute, but how about the truth? Which is that for the WP7 lunch, all 4 carriers were on-board.</p>
<p>I had steak for lunch.</p>
<p>Corndog FTW</p>
<p>Steak? That meal is so dated, I think cave man ate steak. You steak fanboy.</p>
<p>LOL.</p>
<p>because wp7 was proven failure right from the gate.</p>
<p>Not really. RIM has great carrier relations. Also worth mentioning is I don&#8217;t think AT&amp;T and Verizon like that Google is competing with them as an ISP and TV provider. They probably don&#8217;t like how Apple is most likely going to also compete with an over the top video service. RIM isn&#8217;t doing this (at least yet).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly really looking forward to January 30th. I&#8217;ve never been a BB fan, but I&#8217;m looking forward to see what their plan is. . .</p>
<p>Same here ~! I won&#8217;t be switching to any carriers with contract, so I probably will not be able to purchase a BB10. However, I&#8217;m very excited to see what a struggling company is capable of doing.</p>
<p>At the rate they&#8217;ve been going, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Jan 30th is just the reveal of things that already leaked, and actual shipments being weeks/months away.</p>
<p>nah, its confirm at least 2 devices at launch</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s on board right out of the gate. It&#8217;s really all up to RIM now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s up to them to show that they have any real differentiator from iPhone or Android.  Otherwise they are just spinning their wheels trying to hold on to the corporate user base.</p>
<p>There are massive differentiators already official. Just spend half an hour and read the &#8220;10 weeks of BB10&#8221; articles on crackberry.com.</p>
<p>enough to be third, and it looks like they will because nokia is rumoring android now</p>
<p>I dont think that helps anyone&#8230; Android marketshare perhaps but Nokia gaining marketshare? I doubt it</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mWNqe.gif" /></p>
<p>How much would you bet that Google will support Black Berry 10 100%, while MS can&#8217;t get a official YouTube app for Windows Phone 8? On the other hand, guess scroogling Google hasn&#8217;t paid off.</p>
<p>Microsoft brought the problem by their own direct offense ads. As BB10, I doubt Google will support it. But YouTube mobile site works really fine in my Dev alpha</p>
<p>Both sides are being dickish.  Let&#8217;s just agree to that.</p>
<p>Really, you&#8217;re one of those &#8220;Microsoft did this to themselves&#8221; lemmings? Please tell me, what ads did MSFT run in 2009 that made them go sour on windows phone by MWC 2010 (February)</p>
<p>He can&#8217;t respond on that when he only focuses on his Google-loving side of the story.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I hate about tech commenters in general. They never focus on facts when it comes to how they think about their company of choice, some of the most extreme cases of cognitive dissonance I&#8217;ve ever seen. You may like company x, y, z but if you&#8217;re literally so brainwashed that you can&#8217;t view anything they do in a negative light, it&#8217;s pathetic. So when it&#8217;s good news they deny it, and when it&#8217;s bad news they&#8217;re like &#8220;see, told you so&#8221;, another example of another term &#8211; confirmation bias.</p>
<p>I went into a long diatribe about how awful microsofts marketing is recently in the msft tribe. Because I like windows phone i&#8217;m not going to pretend that the marketing isn&#8217;t bad (in the US at least). It&#8217;s just ridiculous.</p>
<p>They should. It would teach a lesson to Microsoft about the drawbacks of negative attacks ads, spreading FUD and creating shill organizations to slow down Google.</p>
<p>Microsoft is simply reaping what they sewed.  Enjoy the crow.</p>
<p>It wouldnt be &#8220;teaching a lesson to Microsoft.&#8221; It would be fucking over Windows Phone users.</p>
<p>Stop taking sides on the corporate level. This is about services to actual users.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s past pathetic to see people being shills for corporations but receive nothing for it other than perhaps thumbs up on a forum&#8230;LOL</p>
<p>it&#8217;s been shown that ms/nokia and samsung enjoy astroturfing popular tech blogs/sites so&#8230;</p>
<p>Perhaps you Windows Phone users should start complaining to Microsoft about their ineffective and failed tactics.</p>
<p>If Microsoft need consumers to tell that to them, I think it would be about time for the consumers to leave Microsoft. A company in such denial simply would not be able to cater to the needs of their consumers.</p>
<p>So, Google prevents Microsoft from making a proper YouTube app. They get into more heavy talks with YouTube, but some Google executives step in  and say no. Microsoft complains that they&#8217;re trying to do right by their customers, but Google ir purposely fucking them over&#8230;then lemme guess, you&#8217;re one if the people that said &#8220;oh jeeze, look at Microsoft whining&#8221;.</p>
<p>Does that sound about right?</p>
<p>windows phone doesnt have users</p>
<p>*Looks at Nokia Lumia sales, sees 6.6 million sales.</p>
<p>I seriously hope this was unmarked sarcasm&#8230;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s the other way around, BB10 will support the WebKit, carddev, and caldev standard google requires to use their services. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t realized they&#8217;re the small fish here and can&#8217;t just expect other companies use their standards.</p>
<p>True, this is the classic MS problem.</p>
<p>So the slower of the two major networks without LTE is getting it&#8230; hooray?</p>
<p>I should have said &#8220;widespread LTE&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>Earlier this week, Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile all confirmed that they will carry BlackBerry 10 smartphones[&#8230;]</blockquote>
<p>The more the merrier is the news!</p>
<p>If all 4 get the Z10, then that would be MAJOR. Hopefully, that&#8217;s what they announce on Jan 30th.</p>
<p>If so, the At&amp;t having Lumia 920 exclusively might have done Nokia in once and for all.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what I was thinking. Add the HTC One X to that list as well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the link but RIM said that they have not signed any exclusive contracts yet, so it is likely everyone will have the Z10.</p>
<p>Im wondering if anyone would sign an exclusive contract to get a blackberry device. Their niche market is shrinking fast.</p>
<p>If RIM wants to command the market again, they will need to show they can sell outside of their niche market, again.</p>
<p>Well, the Z10 doesn&#8217;t target a niche market anymore. According to RIMs CMO they&#8217;re aiming a &#8216;niche&#8217; which makes up one third of the entire smartphone market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m typing this on my Sprint GS3 that&#8217;s connected to LTE</p>
<p>Before you make a lame, sarcastic comment, check your facts.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you reply to his most recent comment where he clarified &#8220;widespread&#8221; instead of getting all bitchy over your network.</p>
<p>Its still a semantic first-world problem that shouldn&#8217;t have been made</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been on Sprint&#8217;s 3G, you would know it&#8217;s not semantic or first world.</p>
<p>If they have a great hardware keyboard, I would have to strongly consider it.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll have the x10 ready for you. <br />
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/unreleased-blackberry-x10-qwerty-phone-appears-again-photos-140030832.html" target="_blank">http://news.yahoo.com/unreleased-blackberry-x10-qwerty-phone-appears-again-photos-140030832.html</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m really really interested to see how many X10 phones sell.</p>
<p>Nice to see that Sprint is going to carry BB10, but it needs to be around the same time as everyone else.  If it&#8217;s months down the road from launch, it won&#8217;t fly with me.</p>
<p>I am excited to see this phone &#8230;. period.  :)</p>
<p>Love competition. Betting that BB10 does better than Windows Phone 8 in the US in a year or two.</p>
<p>Probably a given with the built-in BES/corporate user base.  The real question is whether BB10 can expand the BB user base at all.  Is there really anything about BB10 that will draw Android or iPhone users?  I haven&#8217;t seen anything.</p>
<p>I still see the keypad as a selling point, but we&#8217;ll see</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an OS and new phones too. A different UI, a different device, a different brand, different content providers, a different philosohy, more focus on multimedia, a model with a physical keyboard, an android &#8220;runtime&#8221;, open mail/contacts/calendar, worldwide market consideration etc. The ecosystem entrenched argument is valid but remains argumentative &#8211; tons of people change over time, over policies and brand behavior, boredom and all etc. It&#8217;s all about choice, and when there&#8217;s value the choice is being made.</p>
<p>Look closer. I mean it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to let you in a little secret&#8230; that BES customer base has been shrinking (fairly rapidly) for a while now.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate it&#8217;s still 20% of their 79 million user base = ~ 15.8 million. That&#8217;s a few devices to be upgraded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there really anything about BB10 that will draw Android or iPhone users?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes: a handy high-end device with a 4.2&quot; screen that is optimized for one handed use, but one that isn&#8217;t a proprietary iPhone. In the high-end market today you have two options: open Android phones with at least 4.7&quot; screens on the one side and a 4&quot;, expensive and proprietary iPhone on the other.</p>
<p>Same.  I&#8217;m excited.</p>
<p>Will this get Instagram before Windows Phone does?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say yes:</p>
<p><a href="http://m.crackberry.com/dont-believe-everything-you-read-instagram-coming-blackberry-10" target="_blank">http://m.crackberry.com/dont-believe-everything-you-read-instagram-coming-blackberry-10</a></p>
<p>it run it already if u side load the apk. that if dalvik is working on such devices like playbook</p>
<p>I fell sorry for sprint. Such a dead platform</p>
<p>Will you shut up? At least back up your remarks with some facts. First off, Sprint is making the choice to carry this. Second, if this is a dead platform, how is there going to be a flagship phone on all 4 major carriers? Windows Phone didn&#8217;t achieve that. Wanna know why? RIM has better carrier relations.</p>
<p>Lets end with a question. Do you not want RIM, Windows Phone, Tizen, Ubuntu, Firefox OS, or any other platform to gain traction? Silly fanboys&#8230;</p>
<p>Is there anything we don&rsquo;t know already?</p>
<p>Pricing, Availability, Release Dates, Internal components (i.e. camera&rsquo;s/cpu/gpu/battery life). You want me to continue?</p>
<p>Yes, please continue.</p>
<p>Ok. LTE support, Carrier support (US), BBOS licensing, app availability&hellip;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much we don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the event though.. We can use some competition on the duopoly that&rsquo;s Smapple&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah but apart from those (obviously)</p>
<p>&hellip;..</p>
<p>How about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/30/3931942/six-years-later-rim-still-wont-acknowledge-the-iphone">what RIM learnt from the iPhone?</a></p>
<p>You obviously have a grudge!</p>
<p>pfft, that&rsquo;s so 2011.. No what you want to do, to do a successful  launch is talk about kids corner for an hour.. or panorama mode..</p>
<p>No one really cares though do they?&hellip;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be so Bold&hellip;</p>
<p>Wait. Are you done?</p>

<p>I believe the term is epic fail?</p>
<p>steve is laughing from his grave</p>
<p>I think he has done a good job. &ldquo;What went wrong?&rdquo; question was a trick question to derail him in the interview. The moment he would have answered that question he would have opened himself to more questions that she was waiting to ask him. Remember it was a 3 minute interview and he needs to get out the positive talking points about the BB10 in that short time span. The moment he answered the &ldquo;What went wrong?&rdquo; he would have spent the remainder of the interview on the defensive.</p>
<p>Sooooo essitedddd!</p>
<p>I know I can just google it, and I did. But seeing as one of these events is in London, please can we get these times in GMT too. BTW.. it&rsquo;s at 3PM for anyone in UK.</p>
<p>Whilst my mind is pretty much made up on my next mobile, I&rsquo;m interested to see what they&rsquo;re going to come out with. Whilst I don&rsquo;t think it will happen, there is the possibility that I may end up rethinking.<br />
Never say never&hellip;</p>
<p>Good luck, RIM!</p>
<p>excited and good luck RIM</p>
<p>I wonder what RIM&#8217;s stock price will end up at today. Any guesses?</p>
<p>Depending on what they announce, could go 10% or 15% percent in either direction.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really interested to see when the X10 is going to be released.  I have a few coworkers in my office that are really excited for BB10 but they don&rsquo;t have any interest in the Z10.</p>
<p>Hopefully they announce all of their hardware today. They&#8217;ve had more than enough time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting ready for this!  Been waiting for this a long time.</p>
<p>BlackBerry by Choice</p>
<p>Hopefully T-Hein still has a few surprises up his sleeve.</p>
<p>Bring it on! Legendary build quality. Great UX and emerging market install base.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m optimistic but I&rsquo;ve looked at the app store, and they&rsquo;re not many apps that catch the eye. Hopefully they can do an Apple and make people be like OMG! LOOK IT&rsquo;S SHINNY! :O</p>

<p>The death of physical keyboard!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s cool to bash black berry these days. Let me try. BB sucks. Am I an edgy internet pop star now? Do I get free stuff for calling them names?</p>
<p> C&rsquo;mon RIM, you couldn&rsquo;t justify &ldquo;Balckberry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Experience&rdquo;?</p>
<p>FYI: There wouldn&#8217;t be iPhone or Android phone without BlackBerry. RIM was leading the charge for hyper connected mobile world. BlackBerry 10 is a game changer. QNX is already in millions of cars, robots, hospital equipment and its even used by NASA in the Space Shuttle. QNX kernel is the foundation for BlackBerry 10. Mobile revaluation starts today!</p>
<p>what do they use it in the space shuttle for?<br />
Also if QNX is so popular, how much revenue does it generate for BB?</p>
<p>Not trying to be sly, honest questions.</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to BB10.</p>
<p>Nothing will replace webOS for me.<br />
Nothing.</p>
<p>RIP, sweet child. I hope to see you on the flipside!</p>
<p>get a life.</p>
<p>Hello &#8220;Pot&#8221;, meet &#8220;Kettle&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one treats developers better than we do right now&#8221;</p>
<p>Rim has yet to pay me my earnings for November&#8230;</p>
<p>At least you are getting earning, if you had apps on iOS or Droid you would be getting significantly less to none&#8230;</p>
<p>What? What kinda shit is that? How the fuck would you know?</p>
<p>Quantity and not Quality right RIM? Announce as much as you can now to gain exposure.</p>
<p>Yeah, what he said! Because he&#8217;s totally seen the quality of all the Blackberry World apps, and clearly they&#8217;re all terrible!</p>
<p>Maybe if you live on another plant, where their apps, hardware, and software dont suck, that&#8217;s not true..  Here on plant earth, their 80% stock drop is a pretty clear indicator that whatever they are doing, its of no interest and benefit to their target market.  I welcome RIM making technology thats a pleasure to use, but if history proves to be true, I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know if you noticed, but RIM&#8217;s stock has actually rebounded quite a bit from its low in September.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s actually quite a bit of positive buzz for BB10, even from RIM-hostile sites like Gizmodo and BGR.  Stock analysts who predicted RIM wouldn&#8217;t even be around by now are admitting that there&#8217;s a significant chance for a comeback.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why he said 80% and not 90%, which is how low the stock fell in Q 3 from its 2008 highs.</p>
<p>40% of ISheep apps haven&#8217;t been downloaded once and Android is filled with malware, I&#8217;ll take quality over quanity anyday&#8230;..unlike some people I dont spend my day shopping useless apps&#8230;how many flashlight and solitare apps does Apple have now 10K+ (no exaggeration)</p>
<p>That whole android market/malware FUD is getting pretty old.  Try harder next time.</p>
<p>Heh &#8220;iSheep Apps&#8221;&#8230; Way to disprove stupid with more stupid.</p>
<p>Are you serious? Quality over quantity? After RIM introduced its Playbook incentive scheme, where 1 submitted app = 1 Playbook in Jan 2012, App World is full of horrible crapware apps, where E-books are sold as individual apps. More recently, pirated Android apps have popped up on App World as well, since RIM provides tools to do an APK-to-BAR conversion. Obviously that&#8217;s not all it takes to do a proper port of an Android app, but that hasn&#8217;t stopped people from submitting stolen apps as their own and having them approved.</p>

<p>that&#8217;s not debunked</p>
<p>If apple ceo said it, it must be true.</p>
<p>&#8230;insert jobs saying they will never make a smaller ipad here&#8230;</p>
<p>I reccommended your comment because I actually agree that their apps are somewhat terrible! Especially on the Torch that I&#8217;m using. Their UI and operation is archaic even if they share features of cross-platform versions.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re actually using a Torch?  You are one forgiving user. Mine went back the next day.</p>
<p>Quality is irrelevant.  Unless the app store opens with 500k apps, it will be deemed a failure, and uncompetitive, and even then it is unlikely to be called a success.</p>
<p>Look what happened with WP.  Opened with 6k or so apps, and the ecosystem was deemed uncompetitive.  After WP app store topped 120k, the meme shifted from quantity to not have the hot new app day and date with iOS, or not having the niche apps.</p>
<p>WP has more problems besides apps count.</p>
<p>Thats its biggest criticism.</p>
<p>Apps.. in my opinion are the only questionable thing left with BlackBerry 10. If the apps are there, the people will come back to BlackBerry. Like Dieter said, three weeks. We&#8217;ll see all their cards.</p>
<p>RIM cannot even get Netflix or Skype. Even if they could, both would only work on the Playbook, as their phones are too ancient to do streaming video properly, and lack front facing cameras.</p>
<p>What is it about &#8220;New phones with brand new OS being announced on Jan 30th&#8221; do you not understand?</p>
<p>I assumed you knew that BB10 would have backwards compatibility with PB apps and that the PB OS was the foundation for what BB10 will become.</p>
<blockquote>Even if they could, both would only work on the Playbook, <strong>as their phones are too ancient to do streaming video properly, and lack front facing cameras.</strong></blockquote>
<p>I do know that. I was addressing your comment about those apps only working on the PlayBook. The new phones will have front facing camera, and will run on BB10. So your statement is wrong.</p>
<p>There is no twitter app on the playbook but there will be a twitter app on BB10. They aren&#8217;t just releasing all of the BB10 apps on the playbook now.</p>
<p>I assume you meant to say no Twitter developed app because <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/44453/" target="new">Blaq</a> is a nicely done Twitter client. Of course you can also just pull up <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">http://www.twitter.com</a> in your mobile browser. It works just fine.</p>
<p>um&#8230;.the NEW bb 10 smartphones will be of the high-end variety.</p>
<p>Wow, your comment is just plain stupid and wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how ignorant some posters are ??</p>
<p>But they don&#8217;t have Instagram. /s</p>
<p>3 weeks&#8230;..time will tell&#8230;&#8230;don&#8217;t assume beforehand</p>
<p>No way. If Windows Phone doesn&#8217;t have Instagram, there&#8217;s no way BB will have it.</p>
<p>You obviously don&#8217;t know anything about the mobile market. RIM&#8217;s market share is still larger than Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Yes but that market share is tied up in BB Curves with 2007 internals, Bolds from 2008/9 and finally the touchscreen stuff from 2011. If they haven&#8217;t created an app with all these users, why would they create one for an unproven, entirely new platform with zero users?</p>
<p>Yes BB10 has 0%. That&#8217;s enough for Facebook not to port anything over to it.</p>
<p>not to agree or disagree&#8230;. but since an app can be easily ported over&#8230;. dont you think instagram would do a quick port to see how things go? seems to me like any and all popular apps would jump on that bandwagon so something is immediately available. and then go from there on whether or not they want to do an app from the ground up.</p>
<p>Instagram had been confirmed for months, research before you troll&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, Instagram browser apps.</p>
<p>Read this:</p>
<p><a href="http://m.crackberry.com/dont-believe-everything-you-read-instagram-coming-blackberry-10" target="_blank">http://m.crackberry.com/dont-believe-everything-you-read-instagram-coming-blackberry-10</a></p>
<p>Kind of optimistic about BB10 now&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>Even if a particular app isn&#8217;t there that the user would want, there will be other credible substitutes.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>Sadly I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough. Look at Windows Phone as an example. They have &#8220;credible substitutes&#8221; for almost all of the big apps that they&#8217;re missing, but most users don&#8217;t want substitutes. Most people want the real thing.</p>
<p>And credible substitutes sometimes don&#8217;t work well when the content providers give a limited API like Google&#8217;s Youtube. No app on wp8 can be a good alternative because all third-party youtube apps are restricted and limited.</p>
<p>Have you actually used any third party WP apps? Metrotube for instance is a fully featured YouTube app that&#8217;s even more well done than official google apps on their own platform. The only issue is that google randomly changes the API which breaks the app for a day or two until the dev issues an update.</p>
<p>so no not all 3rd party apps on wp8 are restricted and limited.</p>
<p>I have used metrotube. The same issue arises every time when google changes its api. Furthermore, not all videos show in metrotube. There is a limit because google restricts its youtube api. No matter how good metro tube might be, it will always be limited in terms of how powerful the real youtube app is.</p>
<p>Same as with the mobile website, Apple&#8217;s and Google&#8217;s app not all videos are authorized for mobile. Could be the reason not everything shows up.</p>
<p>Name some ways in which MetroTube is limited because it has all or most of the features one would use in a YouTube app.</p>
<p>4th&amp;Mayor is an example of a 3rd Party app which is better than the official (4square)  version.<br />
Likewise moat of the 3rd party Twitter apps on windows phones, android and ios are better than the official version.   If APIs are not restricted,  3rd party apps tend to be better than the official.</p>
<p>Yes, but the youtube api is restricted. No matter how good metro looks or functions, it will not search through all possible videos!</p>
<p>It does search through all videos and even plays those that are marked &#8216;website only&#8217;. <br />
MetroTube bypassed that by HTML parsing youtube.com directly.</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 920 and I know it..</p>
<p>gah. if that&#8217;s the case, either MetroTube is using  alot of processing power on your phone or relying on a server farm somewhere else.  I guess the 920 has enough power to handle it &#8211; i guess if battery life isn&#8217;t an issue :) but good workaround..</p>
<p>BB10 has a desktop-fast browser with so strong both HTML5 AND Flash-capabilities that there won&#8217;t be any need for a YT-app I guess. Do you use a YT-App on your PC/Mac?</p>
<p>Having dedicated native apps on a mobile phone is different than having dedicated apps on a desktop mac/pc. Firstly, dedicated apps are more optimized and thus less bandwidth is wasted with reloading of page elements. There is better caching and there is also support for external display with airplay and other protocols. Youtube on a desktop is a different and can fully use the processing/gpu power to its advantage. This is one of the many reasons why facebook and many other big company stopped their HTML5 experiments and realized why native apps are better in performance and so many other reasons.</p>
<p><a href="http://m.crackberry.com/sencha-proves-html5-ready-prime-time" target="_blank">http://m.crackberry.com/sencha-proves-html5-ready-prime-time</a></p>
<p>Thing is, how many times a day would I visit a native dedicated YT-app to zap around videos? What I do is browsing the web, visiting blogs and therefore I either watch embedded videos within websites or follow links to YT, Vimeo or other services.</p>
<p>Agreed, with Blackberry BB10 and even the playbook browsing the web is sheer joy, no need to download apps to use scaled down substitutes of their websites. 1 app is all you need, a good browser.</p>
<p>I recently got a Playbook and while the interface is nice, the browser is S-L-O-W.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re being a bit generous&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote>1 app is all you need, a good browser.</blockquote>
<p>Mike Lazaridis, is that you? How many times is this line of thought going to blow up in RIM&#8217;s face?</p>
<p>No, it was Jim who said that.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t agree that the browser is the only app you need, but one thing is certain: many, many, many apps in AppStore are just shrunken down website substitutes I&#8217;d never download.</p>
<p>I have a playbook. The browser is good (not perfect). I still want some apps sometimes. In general though, I hate web apps. Native apps are generally better. With level of integration available to app developers, good web apps on BB10 (not talking webworks HTML5 apps here) will never be as good as good native apps.</p>
<p>For example, web pages won&#8217;t integrate into the BB hub.</p>
<p>There will be a YouTube app. I&#8217;ve seen the icon on some of the demo videos. Also there is a YouTube app for the PlayBook but like you said the browser is on BB10 is the fastest broswer in the business. I don&#8217;t use any app on my computer. Just create a shortcut.</p>
<p>I remember hearing the exact same thing about the Blackberry Playbook.  &#8220;Ooh look the browser is faster and better at HTML5  than the iPad 1&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>People who spent hands-on time with it (still beta-software) said that the browser is as fast as a desktop one, already the Dev Alpha B outpaces the iPhone 5 in browser comparisons and the Nexus 4 in the Sunspider benchmark, BB10 is leading HTML5test.com even against any desktop browser out there and is also leading the Ringmark benchmark by far in the mobile space. And it still packs Flash. So I don&#8217;t care about what you say and I don&#8217;t care about PlayBook stuff almost 2 years ago. And whatever you say, the PlayBook browser clearly DID outpace the iPad 1 browser. So what&#8217;s the deal?</p>
<p>His point is that the playbook&#8217;s superior web browser wasn&#8217;t enough to let it succeed head to head against the iPad. It&#8217;s not all about the internet. People want apps. Not a lot of apps, just a handful. And people want the hot new apps.</p>
<p>Too bad YouTube has confirmed they are making an application for BlackBerry 10&#8230;</p>
<p>Just like OpenOffice can&#8217;t properly open MS Office documents. This is karma for MS. MS doesn&#8217;t have to share the secret document formats and Google doesn&#8217;t have to share their private api/server access.</p>
<p>OpenOffice can properly open plenty of MS Office docs&#8230; This has nothing to do with karma, this is about money. It&#8217;s always about money.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think BB even has those &#8220;credible substitutes&#8221;. BB10 user base is zero right now. Who would want to port their apps for zero user base ecosystem at this point?</p>
<p>Considering they have 79 million users world wide, that are potential bb10 upgrades, not to mean the new users, I say they will have a user base from launch. Also the fact that they stated they pasted the 70,000+ apps mark I&#8217;d say there are developers willing to support.</p>
<p>Nokia had lot more Symbian users when they were switching to windows phone .. There is no guarantee current users will  join the new platform.</p>
<p>No valid comparison.</p>
<p>Nokia went from Symbian dumbphones to Windows Smartphones without a user base tied to special services.</p>
<p>RIM goes from BB&lt;=7.1 smartphones to BB10 smartphones with millions of users tied to their BB-IDs, BBM and enterprise services.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget us iOS users who will also be jumping ship back to BlackBerry!</p>
<p>Thats the deal as well of course. There are truly people who want to jump ship from iOS and Android. For Android users, device and display size is getting more and more important, as Android-OEMs are heading for 5&quot; in their flagship range. Those people now have an alternative beside the iPhone: the BB Z10 with 4.2&quot; and 355 PPI, dedicated to one handed ease of use.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve just described me. I currently use a galaxy nexus which I already consider too big. Unfortunately, Android OEMs and users think 4.6 is too small. Every time the size of android flagship phones jumped (from 4 to 4.3 to 4.7) I begrudgingly went along hoping that they&#8217;re finally done with the endless increases in size. Apparently they aren&#8217;t so I need to switch to a platform that is interested in creating high end phones in sizes I prefer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how many iOS users I hear now who want to go back to Blackberry, I never thought they were capable of changing their minds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not amazing as there are not that many really.<br />
I think RIM has a good chance in Africa and I believe it&#8217;s Indonesia (big marketshare for RIM and it&#8217;s a huge country population wise)&#8230;<br />
However, they are as close to dead in the water in Europe as you can get and are on life support in North America.<br />
Business has for the most part moved completely away from BB</p>
<p>As well, let&#8217;s not get a hard on for the OS before its out in the field and fully tested to see what the experience really is like.  I definitely see some cool things but it&#8217;s looking far from untuitive for the average user.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just apps&#8230;it&#8217;s also the ecosystem&#8230;I think the ecosystem is the bigger game here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Canadian so I wish they succeed but I honestly doubt they will in their current form&#8230;</p>
<p>Just a couple of things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business has for the most part moved completely away from BB&#8221;</p>
<p>~ 90% of the Fortune 1,000 use still use BlackBerrys and it looks good that many of them upgrade to BB10 as they won&#8217;t have to compromise anything in terms of BB-services and security</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely see some cool things but it’s looking far from untuitive for the average user.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a thing people say when they watched one or even a few videos without diving really deep into it. &#8220;There SEEMS to be a learning curve&#8221;. People who went actually hands-on on the other side, say that the experience is absolutely awesome, fluid, fast and &#8211; after learning this FEW gestures and navigation paradigms quickly &#8211; highly intuitive. There&#8217;ll be a short Intro-video played at the first start-up of the device and that&#8217;ll be also always accessible for replay, in which you learn the few gestures. And I really mean a FEW. As soon as you see them, it&#8217;s as much as intuitive as any other OS, if not even MORE intuitive.</p>
<p>SYMBIAN DUMBPHONES?!</p>
<p>Symbian is still a lot smarter than iOS and Windows Phone, its just the UI that leaves much to be desired.</p>
<p>I believe you. It&#8217;s already the same with the legacy BBOS, just in terms of &#8216;smartness&#8217;.</p>
<p>most of those millions use blackberry just for the BBM service!</p>
<p>Plus the people who got pulled in by the PlayBook like me. I&#8217;ve never owned a BB phone but I&#8217;m getting BB10 because I love my PB. And they did actually sell a lot of PBs due to the very low prices for the last year.</p>
<p>same with me, bought a playbook and love it, will consider Blackberry phone in the future because of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never even owned a playbook but I have tried it out in stores and said to myself &#8220;if RIM can bring this UI to phones, I&#8217;d be willing to pick up one of their devices&#8221;. This is coming from someone who&#8217;s never owned a rim device and is in no way tied to any part of their ecosystem.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t throw around the 79 million number like we&#8217;re idiots. How many of those users are even on BB7? Comscore estimates 9 million BB users in the US, and the majority of people I see (corporate) use BBs from 3-4 years ago (Bold 9000, 9700).</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s growth is in emerging markets, where people buy no-contract, dirt cheap Curves that RIM makes close to no money on. They&#8217;re not going to be rushing to by a high-end BB10 device any time soon. Check the BB page on Facebook. The comments on BB postings have nothing to do with the news posted, but rather are full of Southeast Asians swapping BBM PINs.</p>

<p>It helps if you take a look at news from the last 24hrs about RIM targeting the low-mid-high end with up to 6 different phones &#8211; I paste the source link but the Verge covered this yesterday: <a href="http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/rim-hit-multiple-price-points-range-blackberry-10-devices/2013-01-08" target="_blank">http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/rim-hit-multiple-price-points-range-blackberry-10-devices/2013-01-08</a></p>
<p>@Shabach! &#8211; you should to the same.</p>
<p>To SDTRMG&#8230;If BB10 devices are expensive, 79 million of their current users WILL NOT be upgrades.  I&#8217;d wager that the majority of the 79 million users are using sub $150 devices, and unless BB10 devices are the same price/affordable, then no BB10 for them.</p>
<p>Well, BlackBerry has 79 million (only BIS- or BES-conected) customers of which 70% are willing to upgrade to BB10 (after a recent research).</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t seen that poll where 70% are willing to upgrade.  Nonetheless, willing to upgrade does not mean that they will upgrade to BB10.</p>
<p>Of course you&#8217;re right, &#8220;willing to&#8221; was wrong I guess, I think it was &#8220;considering&#8221; or &#8220;could imagine they will upgrade&#8221;.</p>
<p>LOL, please provide a link to this recent research. If there was even a microscopic chance of 70% upgrading (is that in the next year or five years?) the stock would have shot through the roof and we&#8217;d all be hearing about Thorsten&#8217;s genius.</p>
<p>WTF? The analyst estimate was that about 5% would upgrade in the first year.</p>
<p>Come on. I was talking about a poll. Analysts are mostly wrong because they&#8217;re doing math on crap they don&#8217;t understand just because they want to make money with the vibe they produce.</p>
<p>A poll on a fanboy site crackberry? Yep, that&#8217;s a very &#8220;credible&#8221; source. /s</p>
<p>Of course not a CB-poll. Shame on me that I don&#8217;t collect tagged links on my daily web visits in order to prove things in future discussions like this. I just read it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting rid of my Nexus 4 to get a Z10. ..</p>
<p>You will regret that the next day.</p>
<p>&#8216;Woooowooooo, mom, that guy said he will get rid of his Nexus, woowoo, could you make me a hot chocolate?&#8217;</p>
<p>They offer $10,000 gaurentee to devs who pass some requirements&#8230;</p>
<p>And the fact that RIM has nowhere near the market presence world wide that the WP potentially have. Nokia &amp; Samsung pretty much have the whole world covered in terms of brand recognition. RIM is operating in markets which have become increasingly saturated with smartphones, namely North America and Western Europe.</p>
<p>RIM still has a name and brand-recognition in developed markets + is leading in many emerging markets.</p>
<p>RIM was never that big in most of Europe and now are practically dead.</p>
<p>RIM has a good chance in Africa and Indonesia and maybe Brazil&#8230;lot&#8217;s of people but next to no buying power</p>
<p>RIM is certainly suffering in Europe right now but to say Blackberry was never that big in that region is simply incorrect.  Even until last year, Blackberry was all the rage in UK, the biggest single market in Europe.   In the MEA region, Blackberry is still king although market share is also starting to shrink slightly.   With the launch of BB10, however, RIM should see a rebound in Europe/MEA as well as the APAC region.</p>
<p>with a stale, 18-month old platform, every single platform will shrink in marketshare.  The only real surprise is that they haven&#8217;t disappeared entirely yet!</p>
<p>What do you mean with &#8216;Europe&#8217;? Ever been to the UK, the Netherlands or Spain for example? I truly think you&#8217;re talking about Germany, iPhone-Fanboy-Land No. 1. Or Austria, Switzerland or Italy.</p>
<p>Well, good luck RIM, the Smartphone is already pretty cramped with two major Operating Systems, and a third struggling to garner marketshare.  You have an uphill battle, but more competition is better, so best of luck.</p>
<p>If Ubuntu has it&#8217;s way Blackberry has only 12-18 months to get their act together.  One of these guys are going to have to &#8220;kill&#8221; the other.  More likely Ubuntu will end up killing it&#8217;s self before it gets any traction, and pull the other two with it.</p>
<p>Of all the problems RIM faces, Ubuntu OS is not one of them. If anything, Ubuntu OS taking off would mean that devs start writing apps in HTML5 which would solve a lot of RIM&#8217;s app-selection problems as they&#8217;re platform agnostic (or can be ported with almost no effort). Of course, this is a pipe dream, because the OS right now works on the Galaxy nexus only, and I don&#8217;t see carriers or OEMs chomping at the bit to offer Linux phones.</p>
<p>Yeah you are completely right. 3 options are way too much. How could you ever make up your mind with so many choices!</p>
<p>Wonder if they&#8217;re going to have Diet Coda, xscope, hatch, tweetbot, twitterrific, podio, and many more. Substitutes don&#8217;t always work well if they&#8217;re limited, have crappy interfaces, and much more. But the most important thing is google making any native apps for them? I doubt there will be a first party native youtube app.  No third party youtube app can be a good alternative because all third-party youtube apps are restricted and limited.</p>
<p>The Google question is a very interesting one.  At this point, they haven&#8217;t said anything.</p>
<p>At this point, I think there&#8217;s at least an outside chance that Google might just decide to support BB10 if only to give it a leg up on Microsoft.</p>
<p>Google has always supported blackberry, and there is already a YouTube app for bb10.</p>
<p>They stopped making Google sync for blackberry and is the youtube app a ported android app?</p>
<p>- The functionality for Google sync (Calendar and Contact) had been added to the BIS side so sync was obsoleted<br />
- Youtube for BBOS, we haven&#8217;t seen a Youtube for BB10 yet, however I just visited m.youtube.com on my dev alpha and videos play fine.. Don&#8217;t forget the BB10 browser currently is the best desktop and mobile browser for HTML5 and Sunspider tests.</p>
<p>Right. I have a PlayBook and I NEVER use the YouTube app on it because it&#8217;s a pain in the ass. I just visit the desktop-YT-site over the browser as it handles both Flash and HTML5. And as for BB10 it&#8217;ll have great HTML5 and Flash capabilities. Does anyone use a YT app on their PC or Mac?</p>
<p>Flash is disabled by default, and will probably be dropped</p>
<p>Battery life?</p>
<p>Oh snap! I forgot all about the youtube app on the playbook. Used it once or twice and just forgot about it. It was a little rough around the edges. Did google make that app or did RIM? I suspect it was RIM.</p>
<p>I thought that BIS/BES used EAS?  So with google not supporting EAS, it didn&#8217;t matter since BIS/BES currently uses it. of course, i am probably wrong..</p>
<p>MS has supported RIM far more than Google&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, right. App selection will still be much worse than, lets say, Windows Phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. They passed the 70,000 apps mark (BB10 apps) months ago and there are currently coming in approx. 1,000 new apps a day. But I guess you didn&#8217;t know that. I guess you didn&#8217;t even read the article.</p>
<p>LOL&#8230;<br />
They are counting e-books and other nonsense as apps&#8230;<br />
The app count is total BS</p>
<p>If the world leading software producer who makes the best tools in the world (MS) has problems getting developers, RIM who is not known for exactly the best tools or developer relations has next to no chance&#8230;</p>
<p>MS also counts these. Do a search for eBook reader in the windows phone marketplace. You&#8217;ll see one actual reader app for every 10 ebooks packaged up as apps.</p>
<p>Who the hell cares? Search for &#8220;Solitaire&#8221; in the AppStore or Google Play and you&#8217;ll find probably 35,000 results.</p>
<p>Some say they already passed 120,000 apps. That&#8217;s far away from &#8216;nothing&#8217;, however you count this number together.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the world leading software producer who makes the best tools in the world (MS)&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s truly bullshit. MS IS leading, yes, but that goes back to the 80&#8217;s. It&#8217;s just Windows. People buy Windows PCs because they have to, because they can afford them and there is the 3rd party software. People don&#8217;t buy Windows because it&#8217;s great. MS is leading with PC-market-penetration and dollars, but not with knowledge nor anything like that. Think of Windows Vista or 8. Or Media Player. Is that supposed to be great software? No, it&#8217;s crap. So how the hell can you say that MS has the best tools? Just because it&#8217;s MS and MS is sooooo big?</p>
<p>MS has the best dev tools is a known fact! Have you ever seen how their entire programming and designing suite tie together and how they all link into a seamless online base for verification and publishing process? No. Have you ever checked out how much MS does to enable everyone to get easy access to using their tools and launching apps (Even before W8 was launched) through Dreamspark etc? No one else matches that.</p>
<p>No. MS does not make the best dev tools. Your assertion is far from a &#8220;known fact&#8221;. Development tool quality is a subjective thing. As a developer, I can say that I prefer open source development tools to those provided by microsoft. Ask a Mac developer, he&#8217;ll probably say he likes Xcode. I don&#8217;t know what web developers are using these days, but they probably have their own set of &#8220;best tools&#8221;. Ask mobile developers, I doubt they will go on raving about Mircosoft&#8217;s best in class tools or how wonderful their closed ecosystem is.</p>

<p>Thornstein is really good at bullshitting his way out. It&#8217;s good to be confident, but not be too overly optimistic!</p>
<p>What are you talking about? He wasn&#8217;t even interviewed for this piece.</p>
<p>I hope they are successful.</p>

<p>yes, 10 different versions of the game<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p><a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/74883/" target="_blank">http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/74883/</a> Any tablet app for PlayBook is 100% Compatible with BB10, they have a good relationship with a lot of game developers (EA, Rovio etc) vdue to BlackBerrys support of Unity, Marmalade, Shia, Unreal and the OpenGL</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it an automated process to convert an Android app to a BB10 app? If so, they should have damn near everything including some of the big names that WP doesnt</p>
<p>Not really! You have to ask for permission from the original owners of the app before porting and publishing it to the Blackberry AppWorld!</p>
<p>What I think he means is the devs themselves will port because its so easy.</p>
<p>apparently the &#8220;permission&#8221; part is optional: <br />

<p>RIM needs a perfect start; I want them to succeed.</p>
<p>This is stupid, the idea that BB can out app android, iOS or even WP8 is insane and irrelevant.</p>
<p>BB should out function them.</p>
<p>I personally don&#8217;t think they actually need to &#8220;out-app&#8221; iOS and Android.  As for Windows Phone, I think BB10 is expected to launch with 70,000 titles.  WP isn&#8217;t there yet, is it?</p>
<p>They were aiming for 70,000 on launch but article recently said they were already at 117,000+ apps last month. They have exceeded their expectations.</p>
<p>Here is a blog post for those curious.</p>
<p><a href="http://nerdberry.net/2012/12/16/blackberry-10s-latest-port-a-thon-yields-over-4000-apps-in-36-hours-nearing-120000-apps-in-blackberry-world/" target="_blank">http://nerdberry.net/2012/12/16/blackberry-10s-latest-port-a-thon-yields-over-4000-apps-in-36-hours-nearing-120000-apps-in-blackberry-world/</a></p>
<p>Wp8 has over 100,000 now.</p>
<p>130,000</p>
<p>That stat us misleading. MS is combining WP7 and WP8 apps. Many WP7 apps are broken on WP8, and many devs are maintaining parallel WP7 and WP8 apps.</p>
<p>Even if you could bypass country restrictions you wouldn&#8217;t have the 130k apps available to you as a WP8 user.</p>
<p>Is that the case? That&#8217;s great news for RIM.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get this straight:</p>
<p>MS has 130,000 apps for both WP7 and 8 without sideway-compatibility</p>
<p>BB10 has already 120,000 BB10 apps, all compatible with the launching Z10-device</p>
<p>That means: BB10 has a better app selection than WP8. How many compatible apps do I have access to if I purchase a Lumia 920 today then? 50,000? 60,000? Ha!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re being ridiculous. Just about every WP7 app will work on WP8. How am I sure of this? I am a user.  There are over 130,000 apps available for WP users. I&#8217;m still not sure where the 100K figure for BB10 apps comes from as I haven&#8217;t found that evidence. Maybe the amount of existing BB7 apps as that was in existence long before WP was launched, which is a bit of a shame.</p>
<p>The recent Adobe Reader update for WP7 doesn&#8217;t carry over feature upgrades to WP8.</p>
<p>That comes from internal sources, believe me or not. There are 80,000 for the legacy BBOS and additional 120,000 for BB10.</p>
<p>You may have access to almost all apps but you may not know that the app maker also had to create a separate WP8 version of the app for you. For example, I was reading about this app a couple seconds before reading your comment; <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/627am-updated-windows-phone-8" target="_blank">http://www.wpcentral.com/627am-updated-windows-phone-8</a> .</p>
<p>As you can see, there are clearly two separate versions of this app (the article links to each one). This situation isn&#8217;t exactly rare. As a user you may not notice this because incompatible apps are hidden from you so you wouldn&#8217;t be coming across the WP7 version in your searches.</p>
<p>No, WP7 apps for the most part work on WP8. But there are some that don&#8217;t. There are also situations where devs want to add WP8 specific features to their app but they still maintain the WP7 version of the app so they basically have two versions of the same app (especially since Microsoft has made it clear that they will continue to push WP7.8, even on new devices, in markets where they want to sell extremely cheap phones).</p>
<p>The only thing that matters is big name apps, there are over 15,000 fart apps on, and 20,000 flashlight apps on iOS, does blackberry really need all of those and the many other useless apps in both iOS/androids App Store? Do you use 700,000 apps probably not, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s more 20-100 for most people.</p>
<p>But everybody uses different types of apps! You choice might be different to another person! Regarding the fart apps and flashlight apps, that&#8217;s with every type of store! No one says the app store is perfect, but the good apps are excellent and these developers rarely port their apps outside of the mac/iOS platform, It took a long time for flipboard and other big name apps to come to android. I would rather trust Apple or Google with their ecosystems then some dying company. Apple and Google have the cash to keep it going with newer innovations! Most silicon valley startups firstly develop and design for iOS and then android. Just go checkout the many startups and their websites for their apps. 90% will say &#8220;available on the app store&#8221; or &#8220;available on google play.&#8221; It took a long time for startups to start developing for android, but since the android market share grew, they started developing for it. It doesn&#8217;t matter how good or bad BB10 is! If it doesn&#8217;t gain traction with startups, then really it won&#8217;t stay too long. Remember, the pre had an innovation operating system, but lack of app support and bad hardware killed it.</p>
<p>From a business perspective that&#8217;s actually really dumb of them (to only look at the market share of the OS). OK, it depends on the service the certain dev wants to offer (free social apps who make their money with the number of registered users for example will go for the system with a wide marketshare), but if you want to SELL paid apps, you should only look at the profitability of an app store. And in terms of profitability (average revenue per app per month) RIMs App World is leading, even over iOS by 4% (40% over Google Play).</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re saying that Appworld has a better profitability rate, then where the breathtaking unique exclusive blackberry apps? BB10 hasn&#8217;t launched yet, so we can&#8217;t say much about profitability. The one advantage certain maps might be would higher profits if there is less competition in their niche.</p>
<p>BB users are willing to pay more in general, App World has a better billing system than Android and yes, there&#8217;s less competition. So what&#8217;s the deal of porting or even going native with BB10, as all actual BB10-devs say the tools are great and easy to use?</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been impressed by what I&#8217;ve seen so far but I wish them luck nonetheless!!</p>
<p>that is not true, they still doesn&#8217;t have true turn by turn navigation like navigon, igo, tom tom, sygic etc, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Heres a video of google maps android app running on a dev alpha.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=lgWuCKUhXRw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=lgWuCKUhXRw</a></p>
<p> I have it on my Dev Alpha and it works like a dream &#8211; lets just hope Google ports it&#8230;</p>
<p>They won&#8217;t.  They probably would be upset if it was ported.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has had turn by turn navigation for awhile.</p>
<p>Http://lmgtfy.com/?q=blackberry+turn+by+turn+navigation</p>
<p>The BB Traffic App has one feature that none of the others have &#8211; it&#8217;s designed for safety. The instructions are pretty clear and offer good warning, and it doesn&#8217;t show you a route map so that you don&#8217;t get tempted to take your eyes off the road.  It was less distracting than my dedicated Garmin.</p>
<p>I forgot, it generally gives you two options for routes (fastest and shortest).  I understand that it kind of sucked in the middle of the city (e.g. telling you to make a left turn where you&#8217;re not allowed to), but I didn&#8217;t encounter any of those problems when I used it in around VA, DC, PHIL, and Toronto.</p>
<p>Lack of a map was the only thing missing from BB traffic.</p>
<p>BB was for the business set and it seems to me with as functional and beautiful as the WP Office, Outlook, SkyDrive integration is they just don&#8217;t have a real niche anymore.</p>
<p>Security my friend, bb10 is the most secure OS, getting fips certification, one android, iOS, and wp have never been able to get. It&#8217;s military approved.</p>
<p>and yet ICE still went with the iPhone because they couldn&#8217;t find someone to develop biometric scanning software to be used on BBs.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something:</p>
<p>BB10 comes with ActiveSync and Outlook integration (with both tasks and memo sync), DocumentsToGo and MS SkyDrive integration. So what?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying back when they were hot there were no alternatives and even later on when iPhones came about they were perceived as more personal devices than business. Now days people are serious about iOS, Android and now WP as business devices. WP seems like it could be particularly attractive to the business types simply because its Microsoft.</p>
<p>I keep thinking that apps are super important, but I only use a podcatcher, Spotify, and maybe Fruit Ninja once in a while. I could probably go with a BB10 device and not miss muss from Android.</p>
<p>Back on my 9700, the BB branded podcatcher worked great. I could set all sorts of features like only downloading when plugged wifi. This is nothing new, but podcasts on WP 7 is terrible. The built in podcatcher is so limited as to be worthless, and I haven&#8217;t found a great replacement in their app store. Podcasts are huge for me, so I was a bit surprised that BlackBerry (even on an old OS) has given me the best native podcatcher support.</p>
<p>RIM is going to be a player.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t looked at the new o/s you should. It offers a number of unique and compelling features that other platforms just don&#8217;t have. period. I&#8217;ve put together a list here &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://sospep.com/view/article?id=796#content" target="_blank">http://sospep.com/view/article?id=796#content</a></p>
<p>If the leaked specs of the hardware models  are accurate,  think along the lines of nexus 4 + lte + SD  + hdmi  As long as they don&#8217;t price it off the charts this phone will have  some genuine consumer appeal.</p>
<p>Corporate users who are forced to use bb 7 devices for work and openly pine for an iphone or an android, are going to love this. The crackberry addicts are going to love it. the people who still want a device with a top notch physical keyboard and a top drawer os are going to love the &#8220;keyboard&#8221; model they are bringing out.</p>
<p>Now, as far as apps go, if the rumors are accurate, there is a pretty impressive list of mainstream apps. that should be available by the time the phones ship. Will they have 800K apps like apple or android, nope, but how many apps do you use on your phone? will they have those apps? chances are .. ill  check back on jan 30</p>
<p>There;&#8217;s no skype app yet?</p>
<p>There was Skype integration leaked within a video showing off the native contacts app of BB10.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.berryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cascades_pim_contacts_kind_subkind.png" target="_blank">http://www.berryreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/cascades_pim_contacts_kind_subkind.png</a></p>
<p>If getting apps is such a key thing for RIM, why didn&#8217;t they just adopt Android? Do that, figure out a creative way to give BBM to every Android user while making the Blackberry phones extra enticing for BBM and you&#8217;ve solved this app problem handily.</p>
<p>I want BB10 to succeed (competition is good, obviously), but if apps are the big battle for this company, why don&#8217;t they just take the popular, open source OS and let that solve their problems? I&#8217;m sure there must be a good, simple solution, but I can&#8217;t see it considering how badly they&#8217;re struggling and how this launch is make-or-break</p>
<p>Worst idea ever</p>
<p>Blackberry have a simple conversion process to take an Android app and convert it to one compatible with BB10. They are expected to have over 100,000 apps at launch because they have actively contacted developers and got them agreeing to convert their apps. As a developer why wouldn&#8217;t you if it&#8217;s a virtually no work process and a potential new revenue stream. Obviously a native app may be able to offer more OS features that Android may not have an equivalent of but these should be ok for launch.</p>
<p>Sticking with their own OS while having near app compatibility with Android gives them lots of advantages over Android OEM&#8217;s. They control their own store and any profits from it, they can offer OS level features and services that android doesn&#8217;t to differentiate&#8230;..</p>
<p>I think that there are a lot of limitations with what features a ported android app can use. I understand some of those features were removed (e.g. important monetizing ones such as billing).  But I&#8217;m not entirely sure of all the current limitations however.</p>
<p>I have the simple solution:<br />
- look at HTC<br />
- security<br />
- existing enterprise users and their requirements<br />
- long run<br />
- BBM will NEVER work on Android because it needs NOC-connection (BIS or BES)<br />
- differentiation through own hardware and own OS</p>
<p>Blackberry? call me when you have Skype.</p>
<p>I got a feeling BB10 won&#8217;t get any traction after the launch. There is already 3 matured OS&#8217;s in market and unless their devices are put all the others&#8217; offering  to shame on a UI level.  Then there&#8217;s apps,  Blackberry App World  launched over 4 years ago and there&#8217;s a good chance a lot of big name apps won&#8217;t be available.That is inexcusable.  I believed the Storm 1 and other devices sent Rim to the bottom of the barrel and unless this year goes perfectly, I don&#8217;t Rim moving from its current spot.</p>
<p>Well it&#8217;s currently in 3rd place so thats good.</p>
<p>someone didn&#8217;t read this (or other) articles on BB10&#8230;.</p>
<p>The UI is actually more intuitive than Android or WP8 when it comes to multitasking, but it&#8217;s the lack of apps, BIS/BES fees and late market entry that will seal their fate.</p>
<p>Lack of apps: already 120,000 apps at launch<br />
BIS fees: only if you want to use BBM<br />
BES fees: only if you want that high level of security (It also works with just ActiveSync like any other phone)<br />
Late market entry: we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>There are NO 120,000 apps for BlackBerry 10. There are about 80k for older phones that nobody cares about, and there are about 20k for PlayBook + BB10 combined. So effectively BlackBerry 10 will launch with around 20k apps.</p>
<p>Do we have an insider here? Strange. I heard from different sources now (testers, RIM-people) that they passed the 70,000 apps mark for BB10 already months ago. And this number can&#8217;t contain legacy BBOS apps, because these were over 70,000 alone when I was told that.</p>
<p>The things that still has me slightly interested in BB10 is that I still am amazed by the QNX demo disk &#8211; what it did in that little space makes me very interested in how much promise a mobile OS could do on that, in terms of battery life and performance; plus I&#8217;m going down with the ship on physical portrait QWERTY &#8211; and it looks like RIM are the only serious player.</p>
<p>M not interested in BB10. Already into the Android ecosystem a lot. ALso, has some foothold in the Windows Live ecosystem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ditching my N4 for the z10 :)</p>
<p>BlackBerry by choice.</p>
<p>The fact that you even have to say that says a lot about BlackBerry and its fanboys</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t classify myself as a fanboy. I prefer the term user. I use a blackberry, that makes me a user. And I don&#8217;t have to say that. I choose to say that, just like I chose to use my blackberry and I choose to upgrade to BB10 at launch. The fact that I say that says RIM still has dedicated users who like some aspects of their products enough to stick around when there are capable alternatives. It says that if they focus on their strengths, those loyal users will respond. From what I have seen, with BB10 RIM has done just that.</p>
<p>Are they &#8230; Superapps? :|</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter are no brainers.</p>
<p>Instagram? I imagine a lot of people are addicted to that and wouldn&#8217;t dare get a phone without access.</p>
<p>Games aren&#8217;t that big of a deal, as long as they have a few to kick around at launch. Games will always make their way in waves.</p>
<p>Flipboard? Currents? Pulse? Most likely they&#8217;ll have &#8220;credible substitutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google Apps: Maps? YouTube?</p>
<p>Microsoft Apps: OneNote? Lync?</p>
<p>And the ecosystem&#8230; where can users buy mp3s, TV shows, and movies? Does Amazon have a presence?</p>
<p>Dropbox? SkyDrive? Google Drive? RIM&#8217;s equivalent?</p>
<p>I think there are some &#8220;must haves&#8221; that people are going to miss but RIM will have a 1st Party &#8220;credible substitute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skype would be nice to have, but they are going to push their own service.</p>
<p>Whatsapp? More like &#8220;Whatswhat?&#8221;&#8230; BBM wins.</p>
<p>Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook apps? PSSSHHH. This is a Blackberry.</p>
<p>The apps they need are utilities like Dropbox and social networks&#8230; lastly, games. Good games too, ones with mindshare and branding. (Cut the Rope, Angry Birds, Fieldrunners, Ski Safari, etc.)</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s no native skype, who&#8217;s going to use the bb10 chat program when it has no desktop app or apps for other platforms. Even facetime on ios isn&#8217;t used as much as skype is used on iphones/ipads.</p>
<p>Skype: after a recent leak in which &#8216;Skype&#8217; appeared as an option within the native contacts app, I&#8217;d say YES<br />
WhatsApp: RIM is working on them, throwing money on them, we&#8217;ll see how that turns out, because WhatsApp already supports BBOS 7.1</p>
<p>Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook<br />
NOONE needs a dedicated app for these. But I guess you don&#8217;t know that because all you know are the crappy native iOS- and Android-eMail-clients which you have to replace with apps like these. Well, on BB10, you don&#8217;t have to do that. Because it supports ActiveSync, CalDAV, CardDAV, Push-mail, IMAP, calendar and contacts sync and everything in between within the native app. That&#8217;s the wohle point of the entire BB10-experience: the HUB. And the HUB can handle them all natively in a single app and spot. If I would ever have to use a dedicated 3rd party app on my SMARTphone to do email, I&#8217;d kill myself.</p>
<p>Dropbox: YES as I said<br />
Cut the Rope: YES<br />
Angry Birds: 10 versions of it</p>
<p>I think we see that you have absolutely no idea about anything relating BB10 so far. So why the heck do you even write a post in here? It makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>Take a reading comprehension class. While you&#8217;re waiting for it to start, here&#8217;s some examples to review:</p>
<blockquote>Skype would be nice to have</blockquote>
<p>You say they have it. Bravo! Why the fuck are you arguing then?</p>
<blockquote>Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook apps? PSSSHHH. This is a Blackberry.</blockquote>
<p>This is a Blackberry. It&#8217;s going to have a FAR SUPERIOR email experience than any other device out there. Who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> know that?</p>
<blockquote>The apps they need are utilities like Dropbox and social networks… lastly, games.</blockquote>
<p>You say they have those. Again, BRAVO.</p>
<p>WTF is your deal?</p>
<p>My fault. You sounded like one of these pessimistic RIM-bashers who wanted to say &#8217;they&#8217;ll be never going to have these apps!&#8216;. I&#8217;m too used to guys like this on The Verge, sorry.</p>
<p>Instagram: YES<br />
Maps: native deeply integrated TomTom with voice commands and Turn-by-Turn-navigation<br />
Google Maps: port via sideload or browser<br />
YouTube: app and browser<br />
MP3s: BlackBerry World<br />
TV Shows: BlackBerry World<br />
Movies: BlackBerry World<br />
Amazon: might get presence as BB10 takes off, because they already support BBOS 7.1<br />
Dropbox: YES<br />
BOX: YES<br />
SkyDrive: YES</p>
<p>Looks like they are on the right track and addressing everything I stated they needed to.</p>
<p>Sure, BB10 may be able to get the apps in time. But there is the problem of variety in their devices. Games like Angry Birds (assuming they have it) may work on their full touch screen phones, but on the replacement for the current &#8220;Bold&#8221; lineup, a version with a different ratio for the screen will be needed. <br />
They may be able to get the usual apps, but not many game developers would be willing to make 2 or 3 different versions of an app for an OS that nobody can tell will sink or not.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s no deal. As we all know, people in developed markets buy alltouch phones all the way. That&#8217;s why RIM is in trouble. So if those games only come to the alltouch BB10 device, they&#8217;ll be fine. No QWERTY-phone user will honestly care about Angry Birds and stuff these days. The games have to be developed for people who abandoned QWERTY-BlackBerrys in favor of alltouch Droids and iPhones, not for hardcore BB users who still stick with their hardware keyboards.</p>
<p>&#8220;AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU&#8217;RE NOT GOING TO HAVE EVERY APP.&#8221;  If Microsoft can&#8217;t close the deal with Instagram i bet Blackberry not gonna have it either&#8230;&#8230;So lets wait and see</p>
<p>I think RIM will succeed with BB10, unlike WP nobody likes old outdated tiles. As long as they have the most important apps people use at launch they&#8217;ll be fine.</p>
<p>Delusional fanboy</p>
<p>Oh, someone who believes RIM won&#8217;t fail miserably. MUST BE DEFINETELY a delusional fanboy.</p>
<p>Interesting. I am more and more curious about BB10.</p>
<p>Its nice to see RIM finally bringing a product worth talking about.  The &#8220;Flow&#8221; UI is interesting even if it is mostly smoke and mirrors and not really more efficient then what&#8217;s already out ther.  It will be very interesting to see just what apps they will introduce and what the general public reaction will be.  I get the feeling there will be a lot of fanfare at the start with all the &#8220;Crackberry&#8221; users going nuts because they finally have a device they don&#8217;t have to reboot daily, so sales may be modest as the crackberry nation who have been holding out will upgrade their devices.  It will be interesting once the dust has settled to see if they gain any real traction against their competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The "Flow" UI is interesting even if it is mostly smoke and mirrors and not really more efficient then what’s already out ther.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have no clue how you can say this. OF COURSE it&#8217;s MUCH more efficient. Everyone who spent hands-on time with it says that. They all say that you save at least one step at every task you perform compared to other OSs out there. On the flipside, all people who say things like you are iOS-, WP-, or Android-lovers who have only seen some demo-videos without even thinking about how this UI might work on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I doubt it. Sorry to sound like a hipster but if they don&#8217;t have instagram, no dice.</p>
<p>Not to mention a good turn-by-turn nav app, a good third-party twitter app, a great podcast client, pocket, Mint, whatsapp, wunderlist, dropbox, 1password, etc.</p>
<p>Actually, no way you got even 10% of these awesome apps RIM.</p>
<p>Yeah, i am sure they don&#8217;t have those because some of those are iOS exclusives! :D <br />
Most iOS and mac developers don&#8217;t waste their time developing for other platforms if it&#8217;s profitable! Only recently, many of these developers have been trying their luck with android such as flipboard, and others.</p>
<p>iOS is less than 13% of the global market for smartphones, and shrinking in share by the quarter.</p>
<p>The idea that RIM has potential access to &#8220;only&#8221; 87% of existing smartphone users (plus the hundreds of millions of mobile users who haven&#8217;t yet upgraded to smartphones) hardly keeps them awake at night, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>Marketshare doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Apple makes 75% of the mobile industry’s profits with only 9% of world’s phones:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/apple-makes-75-of-mobile-phone-profits-with-only-9-of-the-phones/252548/">http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/apple-makes-75-of-mobile-phone-profits-with-only-9-of-the-phones/252548/</a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see their potential in the coming 3 weeks. It&#8217;s not easy to sway users from iOS and Android! Even WP8 is having a very hard time!</p>
<p>None of those are exclusive apps. Googling will do you some good</p>
<p>I said some of them are! 1password is ios exclusive! If he means by good twitter clients then he means the big 2: tweetbot and twiterrific.</p>
<p>- Instagram: they have it<br />
- Turn-by-Turn nav: full native deeply integrated TomTom with POIs and voice control<br />
- Twitter: the best you&#8217;d use on Android or iOS I bet<br />
- Podcast client: already BBOS 7.1 has a great native podcasts app and I bet BB10 is going to have one, too<br />
- WhatsApp: WhatsApp already supports BBOS 7.1 and RIMs working to convince them<br />
- Wunderlist: already supports BBOS 7.1 and I guess RIMs working here, too. If not, Evernote will be deeply integrated<br />
- Dropbox: they have it<br />
- 1 password: has always been native on BBOS and I bet it&#8217;ll be there on BB10 as well</p>
<p>So. What do you think? I do think you didn&#8217;t get to know that RIMs working actively on developers and especially the most important apps for 18 months now. They already got 120,000, 1,000 new coming in every day and the platform isn&#8217;t even launched. Do your homework.</p>
<p>Where do you get those numbers? You keep adding one or two zeroes to every number. There are NO 120,000 apps for BB10. You are misinformed. That&#8217;s not true, do you understand? There are 80,000 apps for old phones, and about 20,000 for new ones, that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>I get this numbers from insiders and people who went hands-on. Two things:</p>
<p>- On BB Jam Americas back in september, RIM stated that they have 90,000 apps in App World, legacy BBOS and PlayBook apps combined, CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. BB10 apps of course don&#8217;t count into this, because they aren&#8217;t available.<br />
- I know from a source of mine, that the original goal for BB10 apps for launch was 70,000. <br />
- I heard multiple times from different people now, that they passed the 70,000 apps mark months ago<br />
- Saunders says they &#8216;exceeded expactations&#8217;<br />
- Many people around the net who have connections stated they are at a count from 100,000 to 121,000 BB10 apps right now<br />
&gt; Those aren&#8217;t any official statements for the most party, but my conclusion is: when you see smoke, there&#8217;ll be fire. So I&#8217;m confident that BB10 will start with at least 70,000</p>
<p>How is this news? According to RIM, they have ALWAYS had the best apps anyway, so nothing should have changed&#8230; right?</p>
<p>At my work, the T-Mobile reps and I have a solid relationship and yesterday they came by asking if we wanted to upgrade to BB10 devices. At first, I said maybe but both of them are hardcore Android users and they came away very impressed with what they&#8217;ve seen. I told them if they can provide demo units with software, I would be more than willing to test them in my environment. So, we&#8217;ll see what happens next month.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m loving how strong sales for Windows Phone and BB7 is forcing the tech press to reassess BB10 as well.</p>
<p>The whole idea that the mobile market would &#8220;consolidate&#8221; into a dismal, boring two-horse duopoly was always wrong.  Now we can look forward to multiple ecosystems, new ideas, and aggressive competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ecosystem wars&#8221; &#8212; especially from commodity service providers like Google &#8212; won&#8217;t end well for their initiators.  E-mail, calendar, and contacts are easy to replace.  I switched from Google in ten minutes, and could switch from Outlook.com in another ten (if I needed to).</p>
<p>The user, and user experience, is king.  Attack user experience to &#8220;get&#8221; your competition, and chances are that you&#8217;ll tick off twice as many existing users as you&#8217;ll gain in new users.</p>
<p>RIM has been demonstrating the power of BlackBerry 10 to the big brands and the response has been WOW!</p>
<p>When develioping an app they look at number of features. Big screen (yes), fast browser (yes) &#8211; best in class mobile or laptop), processign speed (yes), development tools (yes) and the overall WOW factor (yes &#8211; you&#8217;ll see when you experience BlackBerry 10.</p>
<p> It is completely NEW, it is different, it is innovative and there&#8217;s a buzz! Sit tight for the 30th January 2013.</p>
<p>Those who keep BB for the BBM and another real smartphone for getting things done ..Just checked out Dev Alpha running the modified OS 10 code name &#8216;colt&#8217;  and its salvation!!</p>
<p>Great news. I hope BB takes 3rd place in smartphones,</p>
<p>Another Carrier FAIL, I&#8217;d rather them give new Vizio phones a chance instead of this crap.</p>
<p>Another FAIL comment, because the number of android partners alone in the US is not enough??</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think Blackberry has a chance. That&#8217;s me being as optimistic as I can possibly be about it. I think they&#8217;ll rest uncomfortably in distant 4th place as Windows will take distant 3rd place &amp; Android (because of it&#8217;s over saturation) will take 1st &amp; iOS 2nd in close but slowly widening race.</p>
<p>I think for RIM to feel good, or to feel it&#8217;s worth it, they&#8217;d want to be in close 3rd place. I really don&#8217;t see that happening.</p>
<p>I feel Microsoft should focus on continually bettering it&#8217;s product &amp; slowly gaining ground, as Apple is doing in the desktop/laptop PC realm. They should continue to focus on making few products fantastically &amp; slowly building their user base.</p>
<p>Google I feel wants to own it all, taking a Microsoft approach from the 90s, they&#8217;ll seemingly be everywhere in everything.</p>
<p>Apple needs to just continue to try and deliver fantastic products &amp; increase user base, even if Google consumes a vast percentage of the mobile industry with their over saturation. They mustn&#8217;t lose sight of what brought them back to life.</p>
<p>i was excited about the gesture based navigation, but after seeing the ubuntu mobile os, this falls flat, especially since it is ugly&#8230;.</p>
<p>You realize that&#8217;s the developer model&#8230;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about the User Interface, not the device.</p>
<p>My bad :P</p>
<p>Well come back to me in a year when you get it and please do show me it.</p>
<p>I love linux as much as the next guy (Run Fedora and RHEL on all my machines) but when you have to specially install codecs I wonder how that kind of thing is going to work, when people get a phone and it won&#8217;t play mp3s without apt-getting ubuntu-restricted-extras I think they are going to have massive issues with their strict Open Requirements and being compatible.</p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re a dumb user who&#8217;s all about eye-candy. Ubuntu for phones is crap in terms of convenient navigation and ease-of-use. Watch the video of it one more time and you&#8217;ll realize that you can only handle Ubuntu two-handed. It&#8217;s not thought through well.</p>
<p>ubuntu is not going any where, with normal consumers.</p>
<blockquote>T-Mobile chief John Legere&#8217;s proclamation that &#8220;it&#8217;s going to be a successful product,&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Is this man out of his mind? This is certainly not the kind of talk which is going to get T-Mobile to be competitive with the big boys. This is the kind of crazy sh*t that Mike L. would say that got RIM to the point they have been at.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not exactly what he said&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;We&#8217;re extremely optimistic that it&#8217;s going to be a successful product and our business customers are extremely interested in it,&#8221; Chief Executive John Legere of T-Mobile USA said. </blockquote>
<p>Not to mention lets all remember <strong><em>why</em></strong></em> Rim will fail. Microsoft has the money to pay the top developers to port apps to Windows Phone. Developers don&#8217;t want to port apps because they know the userbase is neither there for windows phone or BB10, Rim does not have this money in the bank thus they will have not enough or the highest quality apps needed to keep them competitive and at the level of android and iOS.</p>
<p>The clock is literally ticking till they die. Its not if, its when. The press has been fluffing Rim way more than they deserve on this too, allowing Thorsten to go on his media blitz.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the apps need to be there and it&#8217;s a high concern. But that said, I also believe you&#8217;re highly under estimating RIM and the work they can accomplish and for that matter already have accomplished .</p>
<p>Blablabla, do your fkn homework.</p>
<p>First<br />
Porting to BB10 is easier<br />
Second<br />
App world is the most profitable store out there which is what Devs should really care about<br />
Third<br />
App World for BB10 passed the 70,000 apps mark month ago already and there are coming in approx. 1,000 new apps each day</p>
<p>Honestly, where do you get all your information?</p>
<p>How is porting to BB10 easier? <br />
How is App World, which failed on BB9 and earlier, and completely unproven on BB10, more profitable than the iOS app store?<br />
And what it god&#8217;s name makes you think that BB10, which hasn&#8217;t even released yet, is adding 1,000 new apps every day?</p>
<p>Get your head out of your ass.</p>
<p>&#8220;BB9&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, clearly you have no idea what you are talking about if you say &#8220;BB9&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyways, it has been stated many times by all the tech sites that developers make more money in RIM&#8217;s App World than any other app store.  Also, RIM has been very public with the app submission numbers and they have said that they are over 70,000 apps already for BB10.  I don&#8217;t know about the 1,000 per day number, but I do know that they are getting a lot of app submissions each day.</p>
<p>I said BB9 because I didn&#8217;t remember what the earlier versions were called. It&#8217;s so insignificant when compared to the other major smartphone platforms that I didn&#8217;t bother to remember.</p>
<p>If you think that devs make more money with BlackBerry, which has ~10% of the marketshare, than iOS or Android, then you&#8217;re either delusional or trolling. But, if you can find me a link instead of saying &#8220;it has been stated many times,&#8221; I&#8217;ll believe you.</p>
<p>You just don&#8217;t want to face the truth I guess. With &#8220;profitability&#8221; I mean average revenue per app per month. That&#8217;s what developers should care of. And this profitability rate in 4% higher in App World than in AppStore and 40% higher than in Google Play.</p>
<p>Here the most recent article I found:<br />
<a href="http://www.strategyeyedigitalmedia.com/article/2012/10/02/blackberry_is_the_most_lucrative_os_for_developers_says_rim_/" target="_blank">http://www.strategyeyedigitalmedia.com/article/2012/10/02/blackberry_is_the_most_lucrative_os_for_developers_says_rim_/</a></p>
<p>I mean RIM has the numbers about its own store and the numbers of Google Play and AppStore shouldn&#8217;t be that difficult to get, too.</p>
<p>But I can say why I &#8220;say these things&#8221;. Because I&#8217;m into BB and still follow the news around them. I also have a couple of personal sources for info on RIM. That&#8217;s why I know thosew few things. So when people like YOU and many others, who don&#8217;t have a clue about RIM at all, judge them without any proof or knowledge, I come in and teach them the things I know. No need to proof these things with links or stuff, because first I&#8217;m not a liar at all and second these people judge RIM and BB10 without any proof first.</p>
<p>How about you take a look at this? <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/distimo-app-store-report-shows-apple-and-google-app-markets-still-booming/" target="_blank">http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/20/distimo-app-store-report-shows-apple-and-google-app-markets-still-booming/</a></p>
<p>They don&#8217;t even bother to mention AppWorld because it is insignificant when compared to the iOS App Store and Play Store behemoths. So don&#8217;t try and tell me that App World is more profitable. If it was, BlackBerrys would be a lot more popular than they are.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t know anything about BB. It&#8217;s that I know enough to dismiss it as a major player in the smartphone market, which it&#8217;s not. So you can have fun with your delusions, but at the end of the day, you&#8217;re sticking with a failing platform.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about average revenue per app per month. RIM itself claims this and I do believe them. I&#8217;m not talking about overall store revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it was, BlackBerrys would be a lot more popular than they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they weren&#8217;t. Thing is that many many apps are free and ad-financed and those need just a wide-spread population of the OS, not profitability in app sales. It&#8217;s all about market-share and ad-reach here. Second thing is that developing for the legacy BBOS (which those stats are about) is difficult, complicated and a a pain in the ass. Third thing is that the legacy BBOS is close to death in terms of app development, because it&#8217;ll be replaced by BB10 in the long run. But the profitability I mentioned still stands.</p>
<p>even after paying the top devs, the apps are still crap. And hardly get any updates for months or years.</p>
<p>Why are they crap? Seen any native BB10 app in person yet? No? I know. So STFU.</p>
<p>No, it is not when, that is a straight up lie. Do you pay attention to any sort of news involving Blackberry. They have a program to gaurentee devs $10,000 in profits or the difference is payed. According to RIM, they have almost all of the main apps. RIM can easily port apps themselves. It has great HTML5 an implementation for apps. Quit being so pessimistic and cynical&#8230;</p>
<p>Cool but how much money is RIM sitting on for them to keep that up?</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t you heard? WP&#8217;s biggest criticism now is the lack of apps concurrently released alongside other platforms, expect the same for RIM.</p>
<p>2 billion. They obviously believe that they won&#8217;t have to pay too much if an app is certified for the program.</p>
<p>Besides, it isn&#8217;t the amount, rather, the quality. If I have all he apps that I already use, why do I need more fart apps? For me personally, I don&#8217;t use a lot of apps. I have game there to kill time, but that is just because they are there. I primarily am a web person.</p>
<p>Also, you have to take something into account: Blackberry will fully support Google Services. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t with Windows Phone 8 at the moment.</p>
<p>I prefer to be welcoming of new platforms that encourage good ideas and that have good performance. I don&#8217;t u derstand why people can&#8217;t realize that they aren&#8217;t getting a reward for being biased. I am here because I love tech. Best of luck to RIM, I hope they can stick it out&#8230;</p>
<p>This is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3853890/t-mobile-ceo-calls-att-network-crap-mocks-verizon" target="new">the same bozo</a> who made fun of Verizon&#8217;s top-notch LTE coverage by saying &#8220;the way they covered those dust bowl states with LTE I think is admirable&#8221; and criticized shared data plans by saying  &#8220;A 5-gigabyte, 10-device shared data plan, when Joe Schmoe Jr. starts to watch porn on his phone, isn&#8217;t gonna work.&#8221;</p>
<p>So yes, he&#8217;s probably out of his mind.</p>
<p>I think this will happen. Windows Phone really hasn&#8217;t gotten as much traction as I thought it would.</p>
<p>they are 3rd place.</p>
<p>now they need to migrate those people <br />
easier than what microsoft is doing</p>
<p>You thinking migrating people on low price devices to BB10 is easier than what MS is doing? Seriously?</p>
<p>Who talked about low price devices?</p>
<p>Low cost devices are where all their current sales are going right now. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s harder to steer their current sales demographic and a lot of their install base to devices they can&#8217;t even afford.</p>
<p>Blackberry is already the 3rd largest mobile operating system globally. The list is: 1. Android  (Google) 2. iOS (Apple) 3. Blackberry (RIM) 4. Symbian 5. Windows Phone <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/09/3174913/worldwide-market-share-for-smartphones.html" target="_blank">http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/09/3174913/worldwide-market-share-for-smartphones.html</a></p>
<p>Symbian is ahead of Windows Phone!?! wow&#8230;</p>
<p>I wonder how many if those low cost devices they can push to the majority of their users though. If their biggest markets are emerging then they&#8217;ll need some really cheap hardware with thin margins to convert them from BB7 to 10.</p>
<p>Nah, i Want WP to be 3rd because of Microsofts bigger and better ecosystem but i wish BB10 at least some %MS to be a small but good 4th</p>
<p>What kind of ecosystem is it you would&#8217;ve to abandon when you purchase a BB10 device over a WP8 device?</p>
<p>For starters, one with its unique and consistent UI instead of one simply ported from Android.</p>
<p>Plus since the whole Google fiasco I&#8217;ve moved everything over from Gmail to outlook so I&#8217;d like support from Outlook and Skydrive and Office.</p>
<p>Um, in what way is the UI a port of Android? The only similarity is a grid of icons; Windows Phone uses a list, is that really so different and innovative? I find the gesture based OS is very well layed out and completely different then Android. Also, this isn&#8217;t an &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; complaint; this is a OS complaint.</p>
<p>I am pretty sue BB10 will support Microsoft services though.</p>
<p>BB is currently in 3rd place in smartphones.</p>
<p>it is in 3rd place it never lost it.</p>
<p>Sprint must not like change very much. It took them up until now to embrace Windows Phone 8, and now they&#8217;re silent on Blackberry 10. Granted, after that iPhone deal, I probably wouldn&#8217;t want to look at other platforms either.</p>
<p>Spring isn&#8217;t exactly a shining gem when it comes to good decisions that actually pay off well.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t exactly lost out on anything by not carrying Windows Phones (I&#8217;m sure the one they had hardly even sold), and I doubt they&#8217;d lose out much on carrying this DOA platform either.</p>
<p>This guy has it right. When your in last or second to last place like sprint is its not worth it to waste time on something that isn&#8217;t fully baked. Windows Phone is there more so than android but it still needs time and money, which sprint has none of to waste on things that aren&#8217;t a complete payoff.</p>
<p>I think BB10 is more fully baked than Android, iOS and WP8 together. Integration and things.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re smoking, but please, give me some.</p>
<p>Its not even out yet&#8230;</p>
<p>What integration does BB10 have, and what are these &#8220;things&#8221; you speak of.</p>
<p>All-deep-in-integration. You remember when Apple introduced &#8216;deep Facebook integration&#8217; with iOS 6? Well, THIS kind of integration. And in terms of BB10, not only FB is that deeply integrated, but Devs get the APIs to integrate whatever app they want that deep. IOS can&#8217;t do this. iOS has no HUB which is API-open. WP8 doesn&#8217;t even have a notification center. Universal search on BB not only searches for apps and files, but also for text within options locally. WP 8 has no CalDAV nor CardDAV. Take the native BB10 app &#8216;Remember&#8217;. It&#8217;s for tasks, memo&#8217;s and other thing. And you can sync it to MS outlook via ActiveSync, store it locally or even sync it with Evernote. Even THAT app is API open for 3rd party developers. The browser is Flash-capable. The browser has highest HTML5-compatibility. When you open the context menu within the browser on a webpage, you get hell a lot of options, from &#8220;Search on site&#8221; over &#8220;Reader mode&#8221; over &#8220;Share&#8221; (where 3rd partys can integrate, too) to &#8220;Add to homescreen&#8221;.</p>
<p>This OS will be feature-complete natively and will have enhancements that iOS, Android and WP8 couldn&#8217;t even copy if they wanted to.</p>
<p>So far all I get from this is that you wanna go deep&#8230; Just remember, it has to be consensual!</p>
<p>But seriously what the hell are you talking about? What do you mean by &#8220;all in deep integration&#8221;? What does it mean for the user. Android and iOS have enough integration. What can Blackberry actually do that can&#8217;t be done on current OSs.</p>
<p>I hope this isn&#8217;t the beginning of a new breed of fanboy,,,</p>
<p>T-Mobile is even more dead than Sprint, yet it&#8217;s the company that&#8217;s showing actual balls in its marketing and business decisions &#8212; buying MetroPCS, killing traditional 2 year contracts, carrying Windows Phone and BB10 (the one WP 7.5 phone Sprint carries doesn&#8217;t count).</p>
<p>Um, T-Mobile isn&#8217;t dead. They have Deatsche Telecom to supply them with money. T-Mobile deserves to be 3rd over Sprint frankly. Like you said, they are making gutsy moves like MetroPCS, all Value Plans, and stuff like that.</p>
<p>Sprint&#8217;s Windows Phone the Arrive has some of the highest, if not the highest, customer satisfaction among all their phones. On a network that doesn&#8217;t rate well when it comes to user satisfaction, they could use an established platforms that helps &#8216;soften&#8217; the blow when it comes to using their network.</p>
<p>All I hear is &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about this platform, nor anything about its potential target group, but as it&#8217;s neither Android nor iOS, it&#8217;s DOA, because nothing can beat those two.&#8221;</p>
<p>If they have carrier support, they&#8217;ll be fine. Sad that the carriers are kingmaker right now, but unless you have something that is so game changing that you can get the carriers to buy at Apple margins and subsidize the prices, that&#8217;s the way the game will be.</p>
<p>Let me guess, not now for the Now Network.</p>
<p>BB10 actually looks quite good, and it seems great at multi-tasking and for typing:</p>
<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5974362/the-complete-blackberry-10-video-walkthrough-surprise-its-neat" target="_blank">http://gizmodo.com/5974362/the-complete-blackberry-10-video-walkthrough-surprise-its-neat</a></p>
<p>I absolutely agree. I&#8217;m really hoping their up and coming devices prove to be great handsets and RIM makes a comeback. I think it&#8217;s a fantastic looking OS and I&#8217;m quite excited to see them in person.</p>
<p>Competition is nothing but a good thing among other manufacturers.</p>
<p>Having had a Dev Alpha for a few months now even with beta software it is a very competitive and fluid OS. I&#8217;m from the UK where BlackBerry still has a large traction here and whenever people see it on my desk they have a play and are always blown away,  It&#8217;s about people actually picking it up and touching it &#8211; good on you for having an open mind for technology&#8230; it&#8217;s in short supply these days. When people talk about OS&#8217;s/Platforms these days it&#8217;s like a threat to their life.</p>
<p>There are things that really impressed me like the keyboard. The keys look very spacious and the words appearing on the keyboard is better than the Android bar where you always have to look up to see the suggested words.</p>
<p>Small details like making the font size for dates on the calendar larger to signify a more busy day is really nice.</p>
<p>Yay, I still love my 9930 so hopefully this will be better</p>
<p>Blackberry&#8217;s got a long road ahead, but hopefully they gain at least some sort of relevance. After all, competition is good for everyone, no matter what company they favor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited for the Z10 on Big Red. BB10 looks really nice. I hope I like it: I&#8217;ve been through too many phones over the last year.</p>
<p>Everybody&#8217;s talkin&#8217; &#8217;bout Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Nokia, LG, Huawei, HTC, ZTE&#8230;.<br />
All we are saying,<br />
Is BB a chance&#8230;.</p>
<p>Sprint needs to come out and say whether they&#8217;re carrying BB 10 or not.  There just might be a mass exodus if they&#8217;re not and I&#8217;ll be one of the first to leave, even after being a customer for 10+ years.</p>
<p>I can also hope that the January 30th launch will tell what carriers will have it.</p>
<p>Define &#8220;mass exodus&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>By &#8220;Mass&#8221; he means 10 people.</p>
<p>Yeah because soooo many people care about BB10, Business is already moving on, consumers are gone already&#8230;.nothing left for Pal&#8230;.sorry, RIM.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t figure out if you were troll or being serious. Either way you clearly don&#8217;t know what your talkinf about since the 80% off the Fortune 500 company&#8217;s have exclusive contracts with blackberry, and that amongst others like the US secret service who still use blackberrys. Security is blackberrys strengths over iOS/android/wp.</p>
<p>First of all, name your source.</p>
<p>Also just because they have contracts doesn&#8217;t mean it is the preferred, or best mobile OS for Business.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/apples-ios-cited-as-the-most-popular-mobile-os-for-enterprise/67243" target="_blank">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/apples-ios-cited-as-the-most-popular-mobile-os-for-enterprise/67243</a></p>
<p>The problem for you is that using BB&#8217;s means that the corporate entity has to pay to license BES or the carrier has to pay for BIS.. is that going to harm RIM? Why use Blackberry when it costs you licensing fees going forward?</p>
<p>Sprint confirmed they are also going to launch BB0.</p>
<p>goo.gl/45Jyv</p>
<p>Lol &#8220;mass exodus&#8221;.  Juicers are the new Tribe&#8230;</p>
<p>RIP Windows phone 8</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious about The ecosystem score THE VERGE will give to BB10. Anything More than a 2 would be a suprise</p>
<p>Ok let&#8217;s have a look on a few leaked things.</p>
<p>BB10 has<br />

<p>All that came to my mind on the fly. Next thing is that they&#8217;re all very deep integrated, because RIM offers the APIs. Each 3rd Party app can be deeply baked into the system if the Dev wants it to. + Invocation Framework.</p>
<p>What do YOU know exactly about BB10 that you say &#8220;2 out of 10&#8221;?</p>
<p>You really are stupid if you have to put &#8220;Apps&#8221; to prove your point.</p>
<p>great response, you really showed him with your sound, articulated argument /s</p>
<p>Take a look at the things he listed. And then you come and tell me who&#8217;s argument is &#8220;sound and articulated.&#8221; He is trying (and failing) to portray BB10&#8217;s supposed superiority by saying they&#8217;re gonna have &#8220;Apps.&#8221; And then he throws in TV, Movies, Facebook, Twitter, etc. The most standard of things a smartphone OS needs nowadays just to survive. And then he throws in &#8220;integration&#8221; in there as if each of those social networks are deeply baked into the OS, which they&#8217;re not. In reality, they will just be standard apps. Oh, and my favorite, &quot; you can simply plug in a micro HDMI-cable and watch contents on your TV.&quot;</p>
<p>Shadowhunter, what&#8217;s your problem?</p>
<p>Me? I don&#8217;t have a problem. I&#8217;m simply pointing out TommesJay&#8217;s laughable arguments.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then he throws in "integration" in there as if each of those social networks are deeply baked into the OS, which they’re not. In reality, they will just be standard apps. &quot;</p>
<p>Yes, they ARE deeply baked into the OS, because the Devs get the needed APIs for this and furthermore RIM offers its special Invocation Framework. Just delete all apps from the list and you&#8217;ll still see a whole ecosystem. And that was the point I was referring and responding to. You get media all the way and the phone is also open for mass storage mode and supports open standards. So where is a &#8216;ecosystem&#8217; missing that WP8 in particular can offer despite Xbox Live services? Nah?</p>
<p>What are some examples of the deep social network integration beyond sharing and maybe contact sync?</p>
<p>What else should be integrated beyond sharing and contact sync? Give me an example. I can share photos out of the gallery, out of the camera, out of the browser, I can share links and I can see recent FB-activities (FB as an example) in my native contacts-app. And also 3rd party apps can integrate with that via the Invocation Framework.</p>
<p>But go ahead. I don&#8217;t know do you mean with deeper integration.</p>
<p>Just want to pick up that HDMI cable one more time. Sure that&#8217;s not an ecosystem item at all, have your laugh. But the point is that I will get content moved from a BB10 device onto a bigger screen. Wether it&#8217;s DLNA, something special RIM might offer or a damn HDMI cable for $ 2.50. You plug it in and it works because it uses open standards. I don&#8217;t need any AirPlay, Apple TV, iCloud or a freaking 40-bucks-iAdapter to do this, all things guys like you would consider being important parts of an &#8216;ecosystem&#8217; RIM is lacking. That&#8217;s the entire point.</p>
<p>BB10 isn&#8217;t the first to have this. Android&#8217;s had it for a while now. So it&#8217;s not revolutionary.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. I never said this is revolutionary, I just answered a guy who said &#8220;BB has no ecosystem&#8221;.</p>
<p>why dont you learn from him if he is telling you stuff about BB10?<br />
rather than just irritating him?<br />
you clearly have no points to discuss other than look down on TommessJay and BB10.</p>
<p>Because he&#8217;s not saying anything of substance. Let me display some of the &#8220;facts&#8221; he&#8217;s sharing with us:</p>
<p>-Developers make more money with AppWorld than they do with iOS or Android.<br />
-BB10 has 120,000 apps (up from 70,000 which he said earlier, mind you)<br />
-It&#8217;s easy to port to BB10 <br />
-BB10 has apps</p>
<p>I get that this guy loves BlackBerry. But he literally has nothing of substance to say other than stuff he either makes up or stuff that any smartphone OS has nowadays. Oh, and if you say anything bad about BB or RIM, you&#8217;re &#8220;dumb&#8221; and need to &#8220;STFU&#8221; or &#8220;do your f*king homework.&#8221;</p>
<p>I follow RIM-relatied news everyday and am active user in multiple BB forums and communities. Within time, you&#8217;re getting to know some &#8216;people&#8217; with a little bit more insight. Thing is, people here love to complain about RIM and BlackBerry and throw out their feelings as known facts. But all their proof is just the public media vibe sorrounding RIM. So I teach them what I know and I don&#8217;t mind about any proof or evidented substance when I talk to people like this. I just say what I know and what I hear from active BB users, isiders and Devs. Believe what you want.</p>
<p>Last chance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll sure go to a Verizon shop to check it out. I&#8217;m a die hard Galaxy Nexus guy though, but I&#8217;m still really curious if BB10 is as good as I hope it&#8217;s going to be.</p>
<p>Just another example of how carriers have all the power in the US phone market.  If a carrier won&#8217;t carry your phone there is no hope for it to success.</p>
<p>I feel like RIM is an aging daredevil stuntman that&#8217;s being asked to make the jump one more time to show up these young up-and-comers. All the new daredevils have landed the latest leap, and RIM has been on the sidelines chatting to the reporters and groupies. Now it&#8217;s RIM&#8217;s turn to man up again and show the world what they&#8217;re made of. They&#8217;ve got a great new bike, and it&#8217;s time to put it to the test.</p>
<p>As we lead up to the Jan 30th unveiling, at this moment they are about 50 feet from the front of the ramp, zooming at 60mph, and all I can say as I watch the jump is &#8220;Don&#8217;t fuck this up&#8230; Don&#8217;t fuck this up&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jan 30th will be their launch into mid-air. Where they go from there is going to be one interesting ride. Will they land on the other side like Apple and Google?</p>
<p>I think that leap was 3 years ago when they could have done this&#8230; now they&#8217;re at a point where they&#8217;ve landed an ugly jump and the spectators are cheering and hoping for them to stay on their bike and not be disqualified (irrelevant)&#8230;</p>
<p>First, oh well its BB</p>
<p>Yeah, sink or swim time.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t see past drowned RIM :(</p>
<p>I want to see them survive.  I can&#8217;t see the market with 4 different OSs (ignoring Symbian), and I can&#8217;t see Google, Microsoft, or Apple conceding anytime soon, so I don&#8217;t have high hopes for BB.</p>
<p>But BB10 will be good.  I really like my PlayBook and its incredible UI.  Too bad it had to come from Blackberry.</p>
<blockquote>But BB10 will be good. I really like my PlayBook and its incredible UI. Too bad it had to come from Blackberry.</blockquote>
<p>What the heck does that mean? You liked it, but since it was from RIM that made it less likable? If it&#8217;s good, it&#8217;s good. Doesn&#8217;t matter what company it &#8220;came&#8221; from. Your fanboism is showing&#8230;</p>
<p>Assume good faith (Playing a la Wikipedia here). I guess the point was &#8212; too bad the company will soon sink and this great UI won&#8217;t be around for too long.</p>
<p>i think they are referring to the fact that it&#8217;s too bad a potentially great product comes from an already doomed company. kind of like voting for a 3rd party candidate.</p>
<blockquote>I  think they are referring to the fact that it’s too bad a potentially great product comes from an already doomed company. kind of like voting for a 3rd party candidate.</blockquote>
<p>define doomed? BB has lost market share in the US but not in the rest of the World</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.droplr.com/files_production/acc_69475/qu9r?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJSVQN3Z4K7MT5U2A&Expires=1352743540&Signature=oqxIZ2InBuc6RPpAL5lC1iUZlrc%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSwirl.png" /></p>
<p>he might be pointing out the lack of apps..</p>
<blockquote>I can’t see Google, Microsoft, or Apple conceding anytime soon, so I don’t have high hopes for BB.</blockquote>
<p>still none of those 3 handle emails better than BB</p>
<p>Activesync in Android, WP and iOS kills RIM corporate businesses.</p>
<p>No it doesn&#8217;t. Only inBB10 work mail is completely and  securely isolated from private mail. All work data and private data are in isolated perimeters. This includes even apps, files and accounts. For example you can setup different accounts for twitter in the work and private perimeters. The enterprise administrator can control which apps gets installed in the work perimeter and he can even delete it without getting access to the private data of your phone. None of the other platforms supports this.</p>
<p>Dream on&#8230;. I&#8217;ve used them all nothing beats a Balckberry for email.</p>
<p>If only email was a major factor in consumers buying a phone BB may be in a better situation. Email is pretty low on the list for the average person though.</p>
<p>anyone can do email.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t hear you over the sound of how awesome BB10 is. <br />
 na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na BATMAAAN</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that. It&#8217;s just a funeral brass band piping out loud on the announced event. They will just crash the gate and say &#8211; hey, Thorsten, time to go, man! Here, have this coffin&#8217; for your lovely phones, black and black go together well!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jambalayajazz.co.uk/images/Funeral%20Band%202005.jpg" /></p>
<p>You&#8217;re post only show how much of a cynical dick you are.</p>
<p>Better be a cynical dick then a delusional looney.</p>
<p>Seriously, guys. Too late for RIM, way too late. And new OS has nothing that compelling, it&#8217;s mediocre by any measure.</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t even used it.  Nobody has thus you know jack shit.  Not sure what you mean by delusional or who exactly you are calling delusional?  But seriously, you&#8217;re delusional by thinking you know or can predict the outcome of a platform that hasn&#8217;t been released or you haven&#8217;t used or whether it is too late or not.   This is why you come off like a cynical dick.</p>
<p>BB10 is going to be amazing and anyone who says otherwise is a cynical jerk because no one has used it yet.  Logic.</p>
<p>By that reasoning wouldn&#8217;t you be just as guilty by saying it will be amazing when you haven&#8217;t seen it?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to. I know what this platform will be quite well. It wouldn&#8217;t be dramatically bad, just mediocre. And with current situation on the market, with the image RIM has, it won&#8217;t increase the sales.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on this market long enough, I often may predict even if I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s wait and see.</p>
<blockquote>And new OS has nothing that compelling, it’s mediocre by any measure.</blockquote>
<p>so are we all destined to use the same outdated and slow OS Apple is shoving consumers for the past 5 years?</p>
<p>Well, you are using basically the same Windows OS, just slowly evolving, since 1995. Not much complaints from what I know.</p>
<p>If you indeed use an iPhone you cannot speak on the topic of modern OSes because you don&#8217;t know what one looks like. Apple: the oldest mobile OS on the market.</p>
<p>I use WP7.  Am I allowed to speak now please?</p>
<p>What about BB? That&#8217;s older than iOS.</p>
<p>You havent&#8217; seen the new OS.</p>
<blockquote>coffin&#8217;</blockquote>
<p>I think you&#8217;re thinkin&#8217; of coughin&#8217;</p>
<p>For the head of the mobile division of an offshore outsourcing company you sure do have a lot of time to troll.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the <img src="Party" alt="" /> Gif damnit?</p>
<p>So right after everyone has gotten new phones for the holiday. Not the best timing.</p>
<p>Lol same thought</p>
<p>Do you honestly believe everyone upgrades their phones during Christmas?</p>
<p>No, but it&#8217;s undeniably the most critical season for sales. That&#8217;s why RIM&#8217;s original roadmap for BB10 was to launch it around September, in order to be part of the holiday shopping rush. It missed that window and will suffer for it, but the hope is that the final outcome of the more extended development period will be a far more polished product.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t need to sell many phones. They need people to notice their OS. Once people are genuinely impressed with the OS, the buyers will come.</p>
<p>They just couldn&#8217;t afford to be overshadowed by the new iPhone, WP8 devices and the top of the line Android devices.</p>
<p>Well tbh, their first target has to be wp8.</p>
<p>That would be true if WP8 had a marketshare..</p>
<p>The fact that WP8 has so little marketshare is exactly why it has to be their first target.  Going after iOS or Android is a complete non-starter for now; they&#8217;d be better off coming up with a soft drink to compete against Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Why the heck do they even need to look at Windows Phone? BB with their legacy hardware is already selling way more than Windows Phone. Also, most people buy prepaid phones for Christmas, not post paid phones so it doesn&#8217;t matter that they&#8217;re launching after Christmas.</p>
<p>Cite that most people buy prepaid phones for Christmas?</p>
<p>Also, obviously RIM can&#8217;t just keep selling 2-year old phones forever.</p>
<p>I disagree. WP is proof that even if you have a great product people won&#8217;t just magically start buying it. I don&#8217;t know if blackberry have got enough cash to promote BB10 into the popular consciousness.</p>
<p>sigh, I meant RIM.</p>
<p>They have a lot of cash, over $2 billion in cash with zero debt.</p>
<p>they gonna spend at least half of their much needed cash on ads though? Because that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ll need to to worldwide. I don&#8217;t think they can afford to just bust their cash on ads like that.</p>
<p>In the environment we&#8217;re talking about, mobile devices, $2 billion is chump change.</p>
<p>i like to think of windows phone as more of an example that it&#8217;s never too late to get back into the game. there&#8217;s hope there but it&#8217;s not looking good for them (both ms and rim)</p>
<p>it&#8217;s never too late if you have a disruptive technology or an enormous amount of cash to burn on marketing and partner relationships</p>
<p>i&#8217;m just trying to understand what RIM has</p>
<p>What you don&#8217;t understand is RIM doesn&#8217;t have to be in it to win it out of the gate. They just need to become profitable in Phones, and that isn&#8217;t realyl a big deal since they only started to make losses and they have essentially no product at the moment.</p>
<p>Also know that RIM produces OS for most cars on the market, that&#8217;s a hell of a lot of potential considering we&#8217;re all moving to smart cars.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t patronize me please. RIM has lost momentum and mindshare in phones. Would they change their business model and do something else is entirely different story.</p>
<p>RIM does actually have these things though. I don&#8217;t understand why people think RIM have no money. They have no debt and $2.3 billion in the bank last quater; up from $2.1b in the previous quater.</p>
<p>They do have great carrier relations, having entered lab tests with over 50 carriers already. And good relations with large businesses who will continue to stick with BB for their security.</p>
<p>BlackBerry is doing very well in many countries around the world and is still one of the leading smartphone brands in several countries such as the UK.</p>
<p>RIM also own QNX which is used in a huge array of systems which require high reliability such as core Internet routers, power plants and casinos.</p>
<p>The BlackBerry subscriber base even grew last quater to 80 million users.</p>
<p>They are doing this well on their current admittedly outdated platform and they are about to launch their brand new platform.</p>
<p>Your definition of &#8220;this well&#8221; is pretty pathetic. By most standards the company is failing, and failing fast.</p>
<p>Windows phone has been around since the stone age and you people keep saying its the next big thing. Lol I Agree its got some good aspect to the OS but its still very plain for my taste. I love Android for the fact that you can really make your phone your own with customization to the home menu.(Not just different types of box size.)</p>
<p>When BB10 phones come out, they are going to be running quad core processors phones with 720p HD screens and 2 GIGS of Rams. Not even a handfull of phones have those specs on the market right now. Including All Of the windows phones, iPhones and 99.9% of Android phones.</p>
<p>The OS is very Android with some tricks of its own. Its going to appeal to the mass. We cant forget that they also have massive government contracts with country&#8217;s all over the world including its BIG business sectors. Because of that, parents are going to be using BB10 for work and bringing it back home for the youth to see. Its going to help spread the word that way as well.</p>
<p>We cant count BB out. The were on top less then 4 years ago. Something windows OS in general as never achieved. They had their eyes off the ball, but its seems that they are well timed with whats going to be cutting edge when they launch BB10. BB and cutting edge hasn&#8217;t been done in over 4 years.Its about time.</p>
<p>BB is here to stay and that&#8217;s good for the industry. Innovation is key.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still buying the NEXUS 4. ;-)</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, that&#8217;s rubish. WebOS was by far the better OS &#8211; virtually everyone agreed &#8211; but buyers didn&#8217;t come. It&#8217;s hardware that matters. And apps. Right now, BB10 is a nice OS. That&#8217;s all we know.</p>
<p>If there are no buyers, the apps won&#8217;t come. If there are no apps, the buyers won&#8217;t come. Ain&#8217;t no app gonna stop me from buying a better phone. The AppWorld will fill gaps, till then you can stick to whatever you have and I shall move on to the next big thing.</p>
<p>Just like they came to WebOS? WP7?</p>
<p>and will the first iteration of Bb10 be as good as iOS 6 and Android 4.2? Not likely they&#8217;re going to hit the os  jackpot and be better than OS&#8217;s that have years of development and hundreds of thousands of apps.</p>
<p>No matter how good bb10 is, RIM has missed the bus. I agree that it doesn&#8217;t matter whether or not they make it for the holiday season, but for very different reasons . .  .</p>
<p>For one thing, RIM is not starting from zero. They have a user base of over 80 million to cater to and to promote these BB10 phones to. Also, there are many people who switches from BB to iOS or Android who want to come back to BB10. Sure, it would have been nice to get the product out earlier but if it came earlier, it would not be polished and reviewers would have ripped it apart.</p>
<p>Yep exactly right. You can&#8217;t compare WP7 or webOS to BB10. Those platforms were re-launches of dead platforms. BlackBerry is not dead so this is a different situation.</p>
<p>How many people were using Windows Mobile at the time Windows Phone launched?</p>
<p>Sorry to say no one will be interested, no one will com, and by next summer the company will be all but belly up. My opinion, my prediction, but I would put money on it.</p>
<p>Not to deny that Xmas isn&#8217;t an important sales season, but it does not make or break BB10 launch.  Apparently from what I have heard, it was suggested by the carriers that they preferred a launch done proper and with focus in the new year rather than try to advertise and get lost in the noise over Xmas when nobody would be paying attention anyway.</p>
<blockquote>No, but it’s undeniably the most critical season for sales. That’s why RIM’s original roadmap for BB10 was to launch it around September, in order to be part of the holiday shopping rush.

<p>BB users (mostly professionals) could care less about the holidays season..</p>
<p>Yeah they see the Galaxy S and iPhone launches and just think nah, why not aimlessly wait until Christmas.</p>
<p>Better to wait to get the kinks out than launch a few months early and get a TouchPad-esque reception. Though, time may not be enough to buy them a different fate, but that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>As someone who sells them yes, I do. Not EVERYONE of course, but it&#8217;s by far the biggest selling time of the year. Missing out on that seems like a bad call considering how long BB10 has been around in testing . There will be lots of iP5, GNote2, Lumias and HTC phones under trees while BB10 phones will be sitting in a factory waiting to sit on shelves and collect dust.</p>
<p>And yes, I do realize that the big holiday season in the U.S. isn&#8217;t necessarily the case for the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Christmas is celebrated wherever christians are a big part of the population, so the rich Commonwealth countries, Western Europe and probably South Korea. Those are a pretty big list of countries where a smartphone would make a reasonable and not-outlandish christmas gift.</p>
<p>Yeah I know, but I had to throw that out there before someone yelled at me about everything not being about the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Who buys BlackBerry outside US?</p>
<p>I believe BB is still very popular in Central America.</p>
<p>and Indonesia &#8211; 240+ million people and Africa (mainly Niagara) 170+ million people.  Also still used extensively in Canada, The UK, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam&#8230;.  I&#8217;m sure there is more but this probably covers the major markets that still use Blackberry&#8217;s.</p>
<p>India..they do not have 3g so all those touchscreens are useless there</p>
<p>India has had 3G for quite some time now.. 4G has launched in certain regions as well.. Pls get your facts correct before commenting you tard..</p>
<p>Btw, every popular smartphone launched worldwide launches here within 1 month of launch date.. most global launch dates include India almost always..</p>
<p>nobody uses BB in Canada</p>
<p>you&#8217;re laughed at if you do, wall the way to waterloo (that rhymed)</p>
<p>This as of June 2012 &#8211; RIM still had 50% of the market in Canada.</p>
<p><a href="http://2fatdads.com/2012/05/blackberry-maintains-major-canadian-market-share-iphone-still-no1-device/" target="_blank">http://2fatdads.com/2012/05/blackberry-maintains-major-canadian-market-share-iphone-still-no1-device/</a></p>
<p>I live in Toronto, and I see a lot of BB&#8217;s still being used here which means you know jack shit macho man.  If you laughed at me for using a BB, you would get a face full of Berry juice but made of glass and metal.</p>
<p>After spending the better part of the last two years with a Thunderbolt, I will keep an open mind if only for that sweet sweet BB keyboard. I&#8217;m not huge on apps so if they get the essential ones then I might go back to BB.</p>
<p>Lots of places. Blackberrys are still much more bandwidth efficient than Android and iOS, and in developing countries with obscene data costs and poor customers, that&#8217;s important.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, I just bought you a new phone and put you on a two year contract. It&#8217;s a well known fact that most holiday phone sales are prepaid phones.</p>
<p>For RIM at least I don&#8217;t think it matters launching before Christmas, the deciding factor will be the desirability of the platform. Just look at people who want an iPhone/Galaxy, they definitely didn&#8217;t wait until Christmas to get one judging by recent earnings reports.<br />
I definitely see you point but come on, it&#8217;s not like Christmas alone would make people buy their phones.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>the first wave of upgrades was everyone uprading to the iphone 5</p>
<p>now it will be the xmas season to finish off the market. honestly, there wont be many left by feb.</p>
<p>what wont be many left by feb. Phone buyers? you for real?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s many people coming off contract in the months to follow. I&#8217;ll be able to upgrade in april.</p>
<p>Year after year, the smartphone market continues to grow and every week there&#8217;s a consumer coming off contract. Rim could have made a big splash in the crowded christmas period and getting out early would have been great for RIM but now when you hit JAN-FEB-MAR they&#8217;ll have the joys of CES, and the great part of the early part of the year to market the crap out of it before samsung refreshes the SG3 and apple and windows in the months to follow.</p>
<p>A lot do, it&#8217;s a bad business move to launch this late.</p>
<p>I dunno, I think selling of all your obsolete stock at absurd prices right before the bb10 launch might work out well for them.  Most people won&#8217;t even know about the bb10 launch.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be able to get a BB10 device free with contract within 6 months of launch.</p>
<p>Best comment in this thread. I think it&#8217;s a day late late and a dollar short for RIM and announcing the new line on January 30th will make them all DOA</p>
<p>Brilliant! Right after christmas, when everyone who was looking for a new phone already got one! ;-) keep digging, rim</p>
<p>If that was the case Samsung wouldn&#8217;t have sold over 30 million SIIIs before the holiday season.</p>
<p>BEFORE holiday season, Samsung didn&#8217;t launch something, or at least announce something after the biggest commercial holiday is over, Samsung is smart, they launched in fall to get early Q3 sales, then stack up on Christmas sales.</p>
<p>Perhaps because Christmas holidays aren&#8217;t that huge of a thing elsewhere, the reverse of how RIM is.</p>
<p>Too early. Come back when you&#8217;re ready RIM.</p>
<p>DOA&#8230;</p>
<p>great analysis. Oh well for grade 10 it&#8217;s not bad I guess.</p>
<p>Blackberries are primarily an enterprise device, so this timing shouldn&#8217;t be a huge issue.  In my small company however we&#8217;ve gone from over 300 BB&#8217;s to only six over the past few years. That should be a big red beacon to RIM.</p>
<p>Not anymore, all these huge companies/government organizations switched already.</p>
<p>90% of the Fortune 1,000 still got BlackBerries you dumbass.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not like they have to turn them in after they switch though. we all have old phones from different platforms and makers. it&#8217;s about what we use right now and what the trend is. when you ask most fortune 1000 people now, they&#8217;re not saying blackberry.</p>
<p>You will find that it is still a high percentage as some industries require a level of security that BlackBerry Devices provide such as the finance industry for instance.</p>
<p>Although some members of my investment bank can use BYOD policy others are not allowed and have to use a company issued BlackBerry. The same is true for government jobs also where only recently some departments are allowing other OS into the mix</p>
<p>That is key. Those enterprise users who are forced to use a BlackBerry will upgrade to BB10 devices and will relize first hand how gorgeous they are. And as that happens, they&#8217;ll become lead users, convincing everbody else :-)</p>
<p>BlackBerry Balance will be a great for helping consumer sales</p>
<p>No they did not. A few of them switched, a couple of others opened up to BYOD, but the vast majority of huge companies and government organizations still use blackberry because it is still the most secure and easy to manage on a large scale.</p>
<p>Too little, too late</p>
<p>January release mean it will miss the holiday season. Meanwhile WP (Let’s be honest, RIM main competition now is WP) are already released in about a week. Windows Phone will have all the spotlight and excitement.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very critical to RIM to at least match WP release date and even more critical to get product before customer done their holiday shopping.<br />
It’s nice to see you along RIM, Bye.</p>
<p>They are already released in about a week? May I borrow your Tardis?</p>
<p>Yes, I realized my Mistake</p>
<p>My Mistake, My brain somehow missed it</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably should be &#8220;for&#8221;</p>
<p>Lol, wp couldn&#8217;t top Bada in market share, what makes you think it&#8217;ll do better after 3 years since launch?</p>
<p>2 years. 2 years since launch. And MS are way more committed now, though I would agree that whether it will succeed is anyone&#8217;s guess.</p>
<p>Bada is an interesting beast. It has ton of installations, problem is most of it&#8217;s users don&#8217;t even know they own a smartphone and never use their handset as one. It&#8217;s a bit like Series 60 in days of old.</p>
<p>The excitement for WP8 doesn&#8217;t go any further than the fanboys. There is none among general consumers. After 3 years of total failure, you would think Microsoft would have come up with something new instead of the same old tired interface that has failed.</p>
<p>Windows Phone is not released in 2009</p>
<blockquote>There is none among general consumers. </blockquote>
<p>Assumption based on the miniscule market share of Windows Phone <strong>7</strong></p>
<blockquote>same old tired interface that has failed</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s universally praised by all Tech blogger, writer, and anybody that use Windows Phone?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, it was 2010. I remember seeing those &#8220;get in, get out&#8221; commercials well before that, but I must be mistaken. The lack of excitement from general consumers is obvious. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I haven&#8217;t heard anyone mention Windows Phone outside these tech websites. Even the Journalist and Bloggers who praise the interface, then go back to their Nexus and iPhones as soon as the review is done. Windows Phone is a flop. If Microsoft was smart, they would keep the name Windows away from any product they want to be successful.</p>
<p>Man, it seems like only a year ago that Windows 7 for mobile was going to sweep the world away. I&#8217;m sure this time it will happen though, right?</p>
<p>Am I the only one that&#8217;s excited to see what RIM are releasing?<br />
Never been a Blackberry user, but I&#8217;d switch if they offered something compelling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very interested, just because I want to see if RIM can revive themselves.</p>
<p>We already know a lot about BB10.  You can watch videos of the thing in action over at Crackberry.  It looks neat; kind of like an Android skin but smoother.</p>
<p>Good point. People see BB10 and the only thing they have to say is that it looks like Android. That&#8217;s driving me nuts, I don&#8217;t think those people even have a brain.</p>
<p>You can stay in your world as long as you like&#8230;</p>
<p>What is over at CrackBerry does not even scratch the surface of what BB 10 is and even Kevin and his team will tell you this; they are just not allowed to show or tell anymore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not very convinced by &#8220;we swear we came up with a bunch of awesome stuff that we refuse to show you.&#8221;  More likely, it&#8217;s going to be more neat but not groundbreaking stuff, like we&#8217;ve already seen.  If RIM had anything that was really going to shake up the market, they&#8217;d be shouting it from the rooftops.</p>
<p>I am interested because of the email/messaging capabilities..I used to have a Bold and a Curve and there is no better platform out there handling push email. I am excited to see BB 10</p>
<p>Oh good, I hope they have some<br />
of those app things my kids talk about.</p>
<p>+ 1,000,000,000</p>
<p>Honestly, 2012 was their last window of opportunity</p>
<p>honestly, i&#8217;ll wait to see the final product before judging.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>There&#8217;s never a last window. If there was Apple wouldn&#8217;t have been able to enter the game.</p>
<p>WTH does that even mean? Do you think there will never be another mobile operating system? is that it? nobody should even try to compete anymore?</p>
<p>So RIM will reveal their 2012 phones 25 days before MWC 2013, when everyone other manufacturer will be getting ready to show their next gen phones, and the gadgetsphere will be buzzing with rumored specs of the upcoming superphones.</p>
<p>Oh good, only four years too late to have any real impact.</p>
<p><strong>Good luck. Now, next one please!</strong></p>
<p>Yawn. Too late!</p>
<p>have you seen the OS? No.</p>
<p>Timing is of little consequence to RIM to still retains 90% of fortune 500.  With QNX unproven on phones  enterprise wouldn&#8217;t have adopted it until 2013 anyway. <a href="http://crackberry.com/thorsten-actually-said-bb10-delayed-only-two-months">They delayed the OS 2 months </a>  <strong>GASP</strong>. RIM makes  <strike>most</strike> all their money outside the US. May I remind people that Christmas is a holiday only celebrated by 33percent of the world. Major markets like India with over 1 billion mobile subscribers to North Americas &lt;350million. China, Indonesia, Africa, Latin America, all of these places are of high priority to RIM and they still are top cell phones everywhere but the U.S. BlackBerry 1o will purport into the face of Android and decidedly  end the cystic  reign of Google/Samsungs dominance.

Viva la revolution! #BlackBerry10</p>
<blockquote>BlackBerry 1o will purport into the face of Android and decidedly end the cystic reign of Google/Samsungs dominance.</blockquote>
<p>Is that a reference i missed, or English just not your thing?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t speak for Africa and Latin America but I thought China is pretty much iPhone vs Android land with almost no Blackberry mentioned. As for Indonesia, because I&#8217;m an Indonesian I must say the forecast is very very grim for them. Android is starting to take over and Samsung is catching up in a very rapid pace. My friends&#8217; blackberries are dying left and right and they are leaving these &#8220;quality&#8221; handsets for iPhones and high-end Android. I just can&#8217;t see them doing much other than compete for the third place which only has a single digit of market share left.</p>
<p>What forecast are you referencing that is grim in Indonesia?  I was there this year and I didn&#8217;t get that impression at all.  Your small circle of friends is not a sample of the entire country of 240+ million people.  My wife (she&#8217;s Indonesian) has many many friends on her BBM all using Blackberry&#8217;s and they tend to be on the socialite side meaning they can afford any phone they want yet still choose Blackberry over everything else.   I&#8217;m not trying to say that RIM shouldn&#8217;t worry about competition, but the future is far from grim as you suggest.</p>

<p>Well I assume you can read Indonesian. Yes, it might have been small for now but cracks are starting to appear everywhere. When I go somewhere and held up my GS3, everyone tries to sneak a peak even they are holding a blackberry.</p>

<p>Android is many manufactures and a platform not a manufacturer.  It is Blackberry vs Samsung in Indonesia and that&#8217;s it.  Being either #1 or #2 is far from grim.  Plus in the article the sample is so small to really mean anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of a total of about 1,200 devices sold through Saturday, 800 is an Android, BlackBerry while only 400,&#8221;</p>
<p>I will want to see yearly or quarterly sales to really truly assess the situation.</p>
<p>I have not been convince by your assessment that the situation is grim.</p>
<p>It is not grim in a sense that they still have market share but it is grim in a sense that they are declining like everywhere else. The 2nd article states the result of a market analysis. Lower economic class will most definitely go for a cheaper Android phones but high end smartphone such as Note2 or GS3 has people queuing like crazy. The trend of BB is still going on in other provinces outside of Java but if history has told something, the trend in Jakarta will reflect what will happen in the future in other provinces in Indonesia.</p>
<p>yes, and apples marketshare has also been declining. very grim indeed.</p>
<p>You sounds like a RIM fan for me :D</p>
<p>Nokia used to have this same narrative of selling to emerging markets.  China may be a bigger market when measured by beating hearts, but the US is a bigger market when measured by potential profits.  Even if China, India, and Africa are amazing markets, people are buying BlackBerries there because they are cheap or offer data and messaging plans that make sense.  It&#8217;s not a high-profit area for RIM.</p>
<p>Profit is profit.  These are areas of emerging middle class that year after year are increasing their disposable income therefore if they are using a BB now you have just increased your chances of a sale of a higher end device.    Also, how do you know how much money RIM makes from selling these lower end phones?  Are you aware they generate money for the use of their network?  So even if you sell and make pennies on the unit, after you sell it you make dollars.  RIM makes  $1,000,000,000 (that is nine zeros and is called a billion) a quarter just on it&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>Another person posting that apparently thinks they know something when they actually know jack shit.</p>
<p>Profit is profit and margin is margin.  RIM may try to survive by selling low-margin phones to emerging markets, but this will eventually put them behind on innovation.  Apple, Google, and Microsoft are their OS competitors and they have lots of cash and employees for the battle.  Meanwhile RIM, who lost $235,000,000 (that&#8217;s six zeros and is called a million and there are two hundred and thirty five of them) last quarter, gets smaller.</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s financials look a lot like Nokia&#8217;s.  Nokia bragged about emerging markets for a while, then exited the OS business.</p>
<p>You do realize they increased their cash last quarter right&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess you missed the point.</p>
<p>Make phone for $5.  Sell phone for $6 dollars.  $1 profit.  After phone sold still make money every month when the phone is used = more profit.</p>
<p>Also, RIM is NOT burning through cash, they increased their cash last quarter.  As for innovation, WTF do you think BB10 is??  I don&#8217;t think RIM is going solely after the low end market and satisfied with low margins, again WTF do you think BB10 is for?</p>
<p>While their profit margins on blackberry phones might be slim, they also happen to own QNX which is distributed and used in vehicle infotainment systems, military drones, industrial systems, and other places internationally, not to mention the  money they make through the use of their network.</p>
<p>perhaps because all the markets you mentioned have no infrastructures..India and most China do not have 3g..try using an iphone/android without 3g and see how good they are.</p>
<p>Link or didn&#8217;t happen. Where do you get this crazy data about 90%? Is it your wishful thinking? &#8217;Cos what I observe among my clients and on the market says otherwise and I never saw a single paper claiming the numbers you state.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the money RIM makes on developing markets&#8230; Did it occur to you that this happens because they sell their tons of outdated phones for pennies? Which obviously is not an indication of a strong market position.</p>
<p>Thorsthen Heins has mentioned it numerous times in interviews over the past few months so take that as you will</p>
<p>Wishful thinking it is then.</p>
<p>When I walk through carrier&#8217;s doors all I see are crappy phones. Closed iPhones which can&#8217;t even send e-mail attachments despite photo or video. Huge plastic android phones you can only handle with both hands at the same time, which can push e-mails from GMail accounts only. Windows Phones on which you have to search through your homescreen and all those tiles if you&#8217;ve missed a notification toast, to get the information you&#8217;re looking for. If that&#8217;s the future of smartphones, I don&#8217;t want one anymore. They&#8217;re all slow and primitive and mostly too big.</p>
<p>So come on RIM and show us what THE modern smartphone really should be like. The other three, even after 5 years, are still selling dumb phones with (glossy) smart functions.</p>
<blockquote>They’re all slow and primitive and mostly too big.</blockquote>
<p>Sure they are far better than those &#8220;modern&#8221; BB7 handsets.</p>
<p>The question is &#8216;WHAT FOR?&#8217; (are they better). But you&#8217;re picking the right word here: modern. Sure are they &#8220;modern&#8221;. They appeal with huge high resolution screens, 3D games and nice graphic effects within the UX. But the thing is that they appeal with features that are nice to have, but not often used, while they&#8217;re far worse than BlackBerries with features which are used all the time. I can see that every day. People holding this big &#8216;modern&#8217; phones and what are they doing? Facebook, Twitter and Messaging all the way (sharing photo and video included), doing calls, browsing news web sites. And here&#8217;s the point: give me 6 &#8216;modern&#8217; tasks within the above mentioned use cases and I&#8217;ll fulfill them much faster and convenient on my old fashioned BlackBerry than anyone on an iPhone, Android or WP device, even while I&#8217;m on the go. I gave it a try and tested a Sony Xperia T, realizing that it&#8217;s nothing but horrible beside the gorgeous screen. And that has even nothing to do with getting used to.</p>
<p>Anyhow, you&#8217;re right saying there are things people like about phones today, which BB7 handsets can&#8217;t give them. And here&#8217;s the next big point: BB10 devices finally can, even partly better. Without giving up on the old-fashioned features, on which BB7 handsets are still glorious. And that&#8217;s great. People doesn&#8217;t have to compromise anymore on their most-used features when they want to have &#8216;modern&#8217; one. Thanks to BB10. You&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>I believe there are two different ideas at work here in your comment. You asked to compare 6 &#8220;modern&#8221; task between your current BB and most other smartphone UI&#8217;s and claim that you can do them fast and more conveniently on your phone.  The second is your mention that the new BB10 will be able to compete against modern smartphone OS without compramising the convenient feel of BB7.</p>
<p>I would argue the first statement can be said by anyone who has customized their phone to their own liking. Android, iOS and WP allow for one click share features, multiple tabbed screens, lock screen notifications, fast app switching and a vast portfolio of social networking plug-ins. To say you can do &#8220;modern&#8221; task faster on a BB7 rather than the others is more a personal annecdote rather than a general consensus.</p>
<p>As far as your second arguement, I would imagine BB10 will run into the same issues as any other modern smartphone OS. It&#8217;s an OS tailored for touch. Yes they will offer a qwerty form factor, but multitasking is heavy gesture based event. Most die hard BB user mention that the keyboard, security, and simplicity are the main reason they stick with the platform. I would ask that you check out a couple of videos of the new OS and tell me if you really believe it offers  simplicity or better keyboard experience out of the box.</p>
<p>The new OS does not resemble BB7 in any way, so assuming people will just pick up the phone and use it like a BB7 device seems a bit naive. People will need the same kind of help and instructions as anyone picking up a WP. Whereas anyone moving from BB to either Android or iOS will have family, friends, co-workers or kids who can walk them through the device. I feel that will be the biggest issue BB will need to overcome, the learning curve vs the familiarity of already existing devices.</p>
<p>(Note I have yet to come across a video of how the new OS will work with a keyboard)</p>
<p>I know BlackBerry 10 very well (what there&#8217;s leaked and showed so far) and am currently using a Bold 9900. I don&#8217;t know exactly how to explain it, but you have a BlackBerry 100% under control, you&#8217;re always on top of your information. Just the homescreen alone gives you all relevant information within 0.5 seconds. All apps are integrated with each other, task-switching is fast, typing is fast as hell, it&#8217;s very handy, even copying and pasting text. You control a BlackBerry blind, like a gamepad of a gaming console, especially with the button shortcuts. I thought it&#8217;s impossible to transfer this user-experience to an alltouch device but I think with BB10 they&#8217;re accomplishing this &#8211; at least as much as they can. It&#8217;s done by the gestures and the one-handed ease of use. Just the peek feature is superior and the hub is so much more than a notification center. It seems complicated at first but anyone who spent hands on time with it says you&#8217;re getting used to it very quickly and coming back to an iPhone or Android device feels lame.</p>
<p>Browsing on your BB7 device is faster an more convenient than on iOS, Android and WP? You gotta be kidding me&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe not browsing, but messaging, email, and making phone calls is a hell of a lot more convenient.</p>
<p>at least it can make phone calls..one thing the iPhone cannot do..sorry but as an owner of 3g-4-4s-5 I can honestly say that  no iphones can do the basic thing it was meant to do &#8220;phone calls&#8221;</p>
<p>Phew: lucky you told us, else 100 million or so users would have continued to be deluded for eternity.</p>
<p>I said tasking. So when you&#8217;re browsing the web, what do you do most in there? Gathering information! Checking Google, eBay, Amazon, forums, blogs and news websites. Thats what I do most. And as many sites have mobile counterparts, BB works very fine.</p>
<p>tl;dr. Who cares, really. It&#8217;s RIM.</p>
<p>Who cares about what you have to say?  It&#8217;s YOU.</p>
<p>I lol&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Thats 2013, right on schedule.</p>
<p>Good thing RIM gave the media plenty of notice, some folks may have forgotten they are still around.</p>
<p>Whats a blackberry?</p>
<p>Whats a Gonzo? Another word for italic Stronzo?</p>
<p>Leave it to RIM to launch after the world ends.</p>
<p>And not a single fuck was given that day.</p>

<p>..But what if it&#8217;s a exclusive AT&amp;T Edition?!! with a f&#8212;kload of value added bloatware?</p>

<p>Troll bait. Why does the caption from the video describes RIM as a French Canadian powerhouse?</p>
<p>Sorry to say this, but RIM = R.I.P</p>
<p>Too little, too late.</p>
<p>I guess you have used the new OS then. Care to write a detailed review of the product you have never used. Please don&#8217;t use crayon.</p>
<p>Wow, that&#8217;s roughly an 80 day notice for an event like this. Seems like a really long time away. Seems like CES would have been better with all the press.</p>
<p>Yeah, along with all the noise around other phones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the 2 people in Blackberry Juicers will be thrilled.</p>
<p>I <strong>demand</strong> more REO Speedwagon covers.</p>
<p>January 30th is when I shall see what my next phone is.</p>
<p>I think TheVerge should copy and paste the top five anti-RIM-comments, i.e. &#8220;Too little too late&#8221;, &#8220;Dead on arrival&#8221; and &#8220;RIM = R.I.P.&#8221; 150 times manually under each RIM-related article. RIM-haters doesn&#8217;t have to waste their time on typing them on their own then.</p>
<p>You forgot: Research in (Slow) Motion. And something about dingleberries.</p>
<p>Dammit: &#8220;Amateur hour is over&#8221;. Beautiful&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there are RIM haters persay&#8230;its just people who understand its gonna be damn near impossible to muscle back with some mindshare even if you&#8217;re product hits it out of the park version 1.</p>
<p>Not at all. It&#8217;s just people who understand absolutely nothing beyond elementary school skill. It isn&#8217;t all about mindshare. With the right product, a well-known brand and a wide userbase it&#8217;s always possible to muscle back.</p>
<p>Not sure what is impossible about selling BB10 to their existing 80+ million and growing current users?</p>
<p>I think there are a bunch of people regurgitating the same thing over and over again that they have read and heard in the media which has used RIM as a whipping boy over the past year or two.   People on here I think understand jack shit and only seem to be joining in the crowd mentality because what they have to say is is unsubstantial.</p>
<p>Of course RIM has their challenges nobody is denying that, but they are moving forward which is what BB10 is.  They have a new robust secure platform that will run on very powerful hardware and will be competitive.  They have a large and growing base, they have a positive cash flow, they have support of many many carriers worldwide, they are very strong in other markets outside the USA.  These things do not point to it being impossible for BB10 to be a success and rather pointing to a good chance of it being a success.  The only measure of BB10 success is simply if RIM continues to have viable business and make profits to sustain and grow their business.</p>
<p>I of course could be wrong and I will say that I am bias to the positive because I would rather see RIM survive and do well rather than hope they die like it appears many on here want which is horrible.  I just don&#8217;t understand peoples hate and disdain towards a company because it&#8217;s not the platform of their choice or whatever superficial reason they have.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; it&#8217;s per si not persay.</p>
<p>its per se.</p>
<p>you are correct.  typo on my part.</p>
<p>just wanted to make sure we were all on the same page  ha</p>
<p>when we put our brains together,  we is smart!   =P</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t see a reason to buy a RIM phone when you have OSX and iOS devices, Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 devices and Android offerings.</p>
<p>Single ecosystem works its easier for the end user.</p>
<p>BB users don&#8217;t go in for the Apple ecosysytem jail.</p>
<p>Nothing is impossible, but I would argue that a lot people believing that RIM will simply retain their current 80+ million users by putting out a new device running non-backwards comapitible software seems a bit naive. A loi of people chastized Microsoft for doing the same thing and now their marketshare dropped from roughly 7% world wide when they made the switch to a struggling 3% with almost a 500 million marketing budget in 2 years and several OEM&#8217;s in several countries manufacturing devices.</p>
<p>I think what a lot of people are referencing is a Microsoft situation that a war of attrition is not in RIM&#8217;s favor. Do they have enough money to stay in competition while their platforms catches on in justifiable numbers? Will the upgrade process make sense to businesses? Will the learning curve be a turn off? How long will they support the current 80+million BB7 users before forcing them into BB10? Wat else does the platform offer that cannot be matched by an update to Android, iOS or WP in the time it takes for the platform to catch on?</p>
<p>Again, not saying it&#8217;s impossible, but Microsoft is already proviing that it&#8217;s very unlikely.</p>
<p>I think the plan is to have both BB7 (maybe BB8) devices and BB10 for a couple of years at least thus the transition will be a one of choice.  Sure people who just bought BB7 devices and can&#8217;t upgrade to BB10 might be pissed, but not sure what other way you do it?  Sometimes that&#8217;s the way it goes when you take the next step&#8230;..</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about the Microsoft situation to offer anything substantial to the conversation, but are you talking about Microsoft moving from 7-7.5 to 8 with no legacy support?   If this is the case I would think that people were pissed because they went in a totally different direction and dumped everyone that bought into that ecosystem shortly after it launched.   I think the difference is that the current BB OS has come to the end of it&#8217;s life and this is the move towards the future of their OS.  If after they release BB10 and then a year later they release BB11 and dump everyone that bought BB10, that would certainly piss everyone off and it&#8217;s this sort of thing which is what Microsoft did.</p>
<p>I think what the OP is putting out is also Windows Mobile &#8212;&gt; Windows Phone 7 &#8212;&gt; Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>Each time they do it, there&#8217;s attrition, which suggests people dislike disjointed iterations and well.. people are people.</p>
<p>good thing this will come just in time for the holidays! oh wait..</p>
<p>Yes, and I&#8217;ve heard a roumor that this holiday will be the last one ever, and all phone contracts are due this holiday. 8/</p>
<p>This is the start of the new Blackberry world, they are coming back believe me!</p>
<p>What an OS that looks too complex to use? An OS that I have to buy a separate server for to manage in a corporate environment? An OS without a strong computer counterpart I don&#8217;t know about that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not for dumb users.</p>
<p>The  UX is not at all difficult to use; from what I have seen on the Dev Alpha device.  And if you do not wish to Control/Secure devices on your corporate network, you can utilize the ActiveSync ability instead of a BES.  I do question the need for a strong computer counterpart though, as it is quite an easy thing to transfer files to and from a BB10 Dev Alpha device.</p>
<p>This is why 99% of people would not buy RIM shares for example but the point you fail to understand is what releasing this redesigned OS means, it goes beyond the simple functionality and features that come with it, it shows that the company has lost its fear to reinvent, while it may be a little late, it is not too late, so in a five-year span they may be one  company with solid profits.</p>
<p>Other phones are getting more easier to use why use a BB10 you have to relearn the operating system it doesn&#8217;t have a living room or desktop appliance to match that ecosystem.</p>
<p>Not having a match can mean two things: 1. They don&#8217;t work properly anywhere and there is NO ecosystem 2. They blend well with the two leaders (OSX and Windows) and people start buying them so they can have a choice when they buy a new computer. If RIM can put out something solid in the tablet market and the BB10 turns out to be good they may very well be back.</p>
<p>After Christmas?!?! You mean the couldn&#8217;t get their act together a couple months early to launch for the holidays and this is supposed to be branded a &#8220;consumer device!&#8221;</p>
<p>this makes microsoft&#8217;s windows phone offerings look timely lol</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see this work because I think BB makes some nice hardware. Than again Nokia makes nice hardware too and that is only half of the package.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been delayed forever because they are gettign the other half right. People should give it a look at least. If they don&#8217;t like it then, fine, they failed, but writing it off before it is even out is just childish.</p>
<p>i just want to see how good the browser is. if it isn&#8217;t lightning fast, rim will be rolling in its own grave</p>
<p>The browser on the Playbook and even the more modern BB phones are already pretty competitive for what they are running on. Since it will share a base with the QNX based Playbook, I can&#8217;t imagine the browser being horrible.</p>
<p>HTML 5 standard does not mean speed. I have a playbook and the browser is still slower than the chrome browser on the iPhone (wtf).</p>
<p>The browser is already better and more HTML5 compliant than most desktop browsers</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t care what anyone here posts. If the phone works without lag (and that is the biggest thing RIM must get over) then I will be getting one because no one does mobile communication better, no one. And if they go bankrupt I don&#8217;t give a fig. I&#8217;ll get a different phone the next time.</p>
<p>i wish they would just get on with it already.</p>
<p>I  have tried the BB10 alpha B device and its browser is faster as hell. The new BB10 UI is a lot faster (not laggy as OS6) and easy use,. Also BB Hub is a pretty beautiful way to manage mails, notifications, etc. And yes, this thing will have for sure FB, Twitter, Dropbox and much more ;-)</p>
<p>Hopefully this thing doesn&#8217;t suck.</p>
<p>Personally don&#8217;t think this BlackBerry 10 revival will see the light of day. Either someone buys them soon, or they&#8217;ll pack it up and sell off the patents.</p>
<p>Earlier this month when they started testing devices with dozens of carriers, the RIM stock went up by 10-15%, whereas many wanted a penny stock to play their small time trading game. Now they set a date for launch &#8211; in January&#8230; whereas many informed &#8220;analysts&#8221; and &#8220;investors&#8221; had said not before March. Those people must be sad they can no longer trigger a fallout with a sale of assets &#8211; they failed, not RIM. They&#8217;re not getting their hands on the patent portfolio&#8230; they can advise their client to go into licensing talks with RIM if their client can&#8217;t come up with decent business tech.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s testing and a launch date, we&#8217;ve seen some of the OS, including a mixture of icons/tiles, potentitally the best of both worlds &#8211; there&#8217;s the scalado camera software, TomTom with data services, incentives for devs with cash prizes for popular apps, etc. Plus the Playbook is getting BB10, which should give a second life to those devices despite them already running some android apps, and after a huge price drop, at least for the enthusiasts who want to try it out. All the fundamentals are there to play the game&#8230;</p>
<p>30-01-2013 = 10 <br />
3+1+2+1+3 = 10</p>
<p>I love my old Berry but it is going to be  very tough for Rimm. Hopefully they will get to be #3.</p>
<p>Apple and Droid are not for me and certainly I am not the only one. We will all benefit with another solid option.</p>

<p>Well they&rsquo;re basically saying there&rsquo;s only room for 3 major OSes. So since Android and iOS have 1st and 2nd respectively, Windows Phone and BB10 are left to fight for 3rd.</p>

<p>Hey, is that a Newton eMate 300 in the background?</p>
<p>I was just about to comment same thing, there&rsquo;s no iMac today !!</p>
<p>Thank you!  <br />
I was wondering where I&rsquo;d seen that toy before!<br />
Good eye, man.</p>
<p>Microsoft said there will be updates beyond 7.8, but the amount of updates depends on how many 7.8 devices are sold, because Nokia is using 7.8 on their cheap smartphones for 3rd world countries.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure The Verge has these numbers, and I&rsquo;d guess the 90sotv with Adrianne are the most played.</p>
<p>Adrianne&rsquo;s 90sotv segments are the only ones I watch! Please have her do them more often! :)</p>
<p>WP7.8 is available for ALL Windows Phones including the &ldquo;Bronze Age&rdquo; Windows Phones that were released two years ago.  The update is currently available on Zune, and can be forced as an install on any phone.</p>
<p>Who woulda known&hellip; my two year old Windows Phone gets the latest shiz before my 6 month old Android flagship gets old Jelly Bean.  God I miss my 2yr old Windows Phone. It was definitely more stable&hellip; more cohesive as far as UI, and definitely felt faster then this multicore monster with twice the RAM.</p>
<p>For some (read: HTC Arrive owners) we have to use ye olde CAB method.</p>
<p>I was about to come on here and say&hellip;</p>
<p>My LG Optimus 7 on Telus in Canada got the update last night no problem. And the home screen looks GORGEOUS now. I can pack so much stuff on there in such a little space that I&rsquo;m quite pleased.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why The Verge and other media outlets aren&rsquo;t reporting that all (most? a lot of?) WP7 phones are getting the update.</p>
<p>I may be all for Windows Phone and Microsoft, but competition is key to a healthy marketplace and I wish BB10 luck!</p>
<p>Absolutely right. BB10 looks innovative and a step in the right direction for RIM. They may have a long road ahead of them, and I do hope that they don&#8217;t give up.</p>
<p>I hate how people are saying it looks like they copied WP7. So I would assume that if you have big squares on your screen then you are coping WP7??? It looks more like a combination of WP7/ Android 4.0/ Web OS.</p>
<p>And a little iOS, too, with the multi-touch.</p>
<p>And a chocolate bar, with the form factor!</p>
<p>attorneys for cadbury are scrambling as we speak!</p>
<p>Oh god please let the multi-touch thing go.</p>
<p>never</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you know iOS is the only one, to this day, that uses multitouch?</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>And I thought the swiping from the bottom to get to the home-screen was a bit MeeGo-esque.</p>
<p>If anything, this looks more like the multitasking UI in Nokia&#8217;s iteration of Meego. Especially with just the 4 rectangles.</p>
<p>Was thinking this looks like a nice step from the N9, lots of swiping goodness.</p>
<p>All this swipe here swipe there stuff sounds tiring. I sense a major learning curve.</p>
<p>Hi @NewGenNewRev,</p>
<p>Alex from RIM here. Thanks for the feedback on BlackBerry 10. Starting with yesterday’s keynote address, there is a lot of innovation coming from BlackBerry World this week – for consumers and developers alike. There’s more to come, so if you want to keep up with the latest from our events in Orlando this week, stay tuned to our Inside BlackBerry Blog: <a href="http://bbry.lv/cWR2rg" target="_blank">http://bbry.lv/cWR2rg</a>.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Alex, RIM Social Media Team</p>
<p>Sorry, dude. I have to say you definitely have some cool and innovative ideas there, but this is still DOA. There simply is not room in this market for a FOURTH mobile OS. RIM doesn&#8217;t have the money to fight the fight MS is fighting. Hopefully these ideas will be absorbed into an OS with a future like iOS, Android, or WP. Especially the camera timeline thing, that was cool.</p>
<p>Agreed, but looking at all this, there are still a lot, a lot of missing pieces for BB10 to be a full fledged OS. The demo they showed was only focussed on the strong points of the OS and a lot of basic stuff (how DOES the multitasking work, i.e. app switching etc.) was missing. Of course, it will take a while before this is released, but if Windows Phone taught us one thing, it&#8217;s that the first iteration of a smartphone OS lacks a lot of functionality. (Truth be told, this is  iteration 3.0 if you count the playbook versions, so let&#8217;s hope they learned from the fiasco that Playbook OS 1.0 was&#8230;)</p>
<p>The other problem is that a lot of innovation they did show off will probably be in iOS 6.0, Android 5.0 and WP8&#8230; Which will all be released at about the same time&#8230; So then you have 3 competing OS&#8217;es with a strong history and these functionalities.</p>
<p>But hey, time will tell, it&#8217;s nice toe see RIM innovative again and coming out with some really awesome and inspirational stuff!</p>
<p>People have an &#8220;emotional&#8221; response to RIM as being down-to-business&#8230;.like what you get when you want to be productive instead of have a toy. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s the case, it just seems like that&#8217;s the feeling a lot of people have about the company in general. For that reason I think they do pretty well from the gate, especially with all the innovation going on in BB10.</p>
<p>Also android is a really poor OS and most devices get terrible customer satisfaction ratings.  People will switch to BB10 as long as it&#8217;s intuitive and doesn&#8217;t feel limiting (ex: WP7).</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s why nokia&#8217;s meego phones are ruling the world..dream on.</p>
<p>which devices?? I would love to know and dont bring in this 20 dollar back door phone??</p>
<p>Bwahaha! OMG, that was a good one man! Seriously though, nobody will do that.</p>
<p>Agree.<br />
I am a big fan of QNX in an industrial setting and this looks really slick. I just hope they can deliver unlike the pitiful Palybook</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the prototype is running a modification of the Playbook OS, not BB10. Doesn&#8217;t bode well for them as of yet.</p>
<p>I own an iPhone myself, but I like Windows Phone and they need more fanboys!! If its good enough for <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/28/2983312/steve-wozniak-windows-phone-android-comparison" target="new">Woz</a>, its good enough for plenty of people.</p>
<p>You mean like other bored [m|b]illionairs?</p>
<p>Looks very interesting to say the least, I like how Microsoft and now RIM are really trying to innovate and try something new.</p>
<p>When I grow up, I want to be like Dieter.<br />
PS. That looks nice.</p>
<p>And look spectacular in a suit and thick rimmed glasses?</p>
<p>Indeed, we should all aspire to it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s late, so very late, but aside from the homescreen layout I like what I see so far. The keyboard and camera features do seem pretty clever.</p>
<p>p.s. Dieter is a cutie.</p>
<p>The keyboard is very Swype and Swiftkey-esque in the demo. I applaud that combo and the other items covered.</p>
<p>The camera app is most definitely a license of this app from Scalado<br />
<a href="http://www.scalado.com/display/en/Rewind" target="_blank">http://www.scalado.com/display/en/Rewind</a></p>
<p>that picnic video is really creepy</p>
<p>Why yes, yes it is.</p>
<p>I know it. Why hasn&#8217;t someone (android or iOS or even 3rd party like swifttkey) thought about tht keyboard yet? I really want that in a keyboard it looks great. It&#8217;s nice to see BB actually innovate. I still think its much to late, but still competition is good for all of us.</p>
<p>The word prediction on the keyboard looks like it&#8217;d be really useful, hopefully that&#8217;s a feature that&#8217;ll make it into the final build and perhaps even be adopted by some of the other platforms.</p>
<p>Some Android developer watched this today and is already working on it. Bet you it gets released before BB10 is released.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it will work just as good.  /s</p>
<p>Because small developer teams never make things better than the big names /s</p>
<p>Seeing how WP7 interface looked on Android I think you should remove that &#8220;/s&#8221;</p>
<p>The word prediction is already available on Android in the form of Swiftkey, which apparently is the tech behind this BB keyboard. The implementation is just a little different.</p>
<p>The implementation makes all the difference. I&#8217;m not a fan of SwiftKey&#8217;s.</p>
<p>WP7 already has word prediction, and I might add much better than iOS:</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.devicemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dm-wp7-keyboard.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried the keyboard on iOS,  Android, and Windows Phone. Out the of three, Windows Phone definitely wins when it comes to word prediciton and autocorrect.</p>
<p>christ that things low res!</p>
<p>Or maybe the camera which used to take the photograph was pathetic?<br />
<strong>Special emphasis on anything other than the screen</strong></p>
<p>*which was used</p>
<p>No that phone is low res because windows phone dont use current specs remember??</p>
<p>Oh look, he doesnt have a good reply so he corrects your grammar.</p>
<p>on my Palm Pre, you can see the &#8220;digitizer&#8221; part, little sort of dots on the screen.  My Galaxy Nexus, with its 720 reported resolution has some similar colour inaccuracies similar to this, but my iPhone 4?  It <strong>never</strong> looks this bad in photos, regardless of camera etc.</p>
<p>Just look at the text, or the colour of the &#8220;keys&#8221;, looks very low res!</p>
<p>That camera app is ingenious! probably my favorite thing on BB so far. Also like the gesture controls in the keyboard.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m a little impressed. TAT has really done wonders for RIM design.</p>
<p>If only they could find a harder typeface.</p>
<p>I TAT also worked on Android before they were bought out by RIM.</p>
<p>P.S. TheVerge has the best coverage out of all the tech blogs. Its really different not alot of bais BS like the other guys.. just straight out facts.</p>
<p>Unbiased unless they&#8217;re reviewing phone ecosystems, of course.</p>
<p>Jerk</p>
<p>Oh we&#8217;re still on that?</p>
<p>Just exercising my first amendment rights.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been argued up down and sideways by now, but it doesn&#8217;t erase the fact that Topolsky reviewed a device and ecosystem with little knowledge of its workings, contributing to an overall low score.</p>
<p>In the end, it probably doesn&#8217;t matter since non-techies probably wouldn&#8217;t pay attention to this site over ZDNet or CNET &#8211; just irritating.</p>
<p>The fact that it&#8217;s your right doesn&#8217;t make it less pathetic.  Come on.  I&#8217;m a huge windows phone fan, dabbling in development.  I had zero problem with his review.  He didn&#8217;t give it a perfect score.  OH NO, HE&#8217;S A FANBOY!!</p>
<p>Besides, this is a BB article.  For shame&#8230;</p>
<p>Dude, the first amendment has NOTHING to do with and does nothing to protect your ability to troll on the Verge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/area-man-passionate-defender-of-what-he-imagines-c,2849/" target="_blank">http://www.theonion.com/articles/area-man-passionate-defender-of-what-he-imagines-c,2849/</a></p>
<p>Your a loser FYI</p>
<p>Wow, that really hurt. I&#8217;ll be sure to mail my therapy bills to you&#8230; what&#8217;s that address again? The one for your mother&#8217;s basement, of course!</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using a review unit Lumia 900 for the past two weeks, and I REALLY dislike the ecosystem. It&#8217;s an opinion. That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, why? Anything specific?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be the first to admit some of Microsoft&#8217;s services are kind of meh, but to say you <em>really</em> dislike it is interesting.</p>
<p>There are some things I really liked, like its Voice Control. Seemed better than Siri in my opinion.<br />
Multitasking, to me, is simply not intuitive. I kept hitting the Windows button expecting that to do the trick, and it seems ass backwards to use the Back button for multitasking. <br />
I&#8217;m a fan of the minimal design, but Metro just doesn&#8217;t work for me. Live Tiles haven&#8217;t done much for me, I just found myself swiping to the right to access the app from the list, I&#8217;m not sure why.<br />
The keyboard isn&#8217;t really easy for me to use, but that&#8217;s personal preference I suppose.<br />
As pretty as the mail app may be, it doesn&#8217;t seem to be very functional. At least not in the way I&#8217;m used to.<br />
And the swiping to the left and right to access different pieces of an app is just not intuitive to me. <br />
There&#8217;s a lot of potential in WP7, but it just isn&#8217;t there yet. <br />
I say that I really dislike it because when I review devices, I make it my primary device, and with WP7, performing tasks was kind of inconvenient compared to on my 4S.<br />
And most of the apps I use COULD be found on WP7, but they weren&#8217;t of the same quality.</p>
<p>Interesting &#8211; I have the opposite experience with the voice control&#8230; it hardly ever gets my dictation right and I&#8217;ve more or less gotten over it and stopped using it.</p>
<p>The multitasking could be improved, I agree. I think holding down the back button makes enough sense though&#8230; in a way you&#8217;re indeed going back to an app you used recently.</p>
<p>The live tiles are useful for specific things in my opinion, like displaying weather, the current stock price and deep link shortcuts such as the many wifi settings app ones. The counters are good too, though for some apps it seems superfluous.</p>
<p>As far as keyboards go, I&#8217;ve never been good with virtual ones so I tend to get phones that have physical alternatives (hence me picking up a Dell Venue Pro.)</p>
<p>For Mail, what functionality are you looking for? The only thing it&#8217;s lacking right now is label support in Gmail for me&#8230;. though it&#8217;s all represented as folders so there&#8217;s at least partial support.</p>
<p>I think WP7 is a very different usage paradigm than most people are accustomed to, and with that comes a bit of relearning and awkwardness until you figure it out. When I first owned an Android phone, it took me weeks to get it the way I liked &#8211; a day or two with WP7 to reach the same satisfaction level.</p>
<p>To each their own &#8211; that&#8217;s for sure &#8211; but overall I&#8217;m pleased and eagerly awaiting new features in Apollo.</p>
<p>I was impressed with how, when I was driving, it said &#8220;You have a message from (name), read or ignore?&#8221; That was cool, and it was definitely new. <br />
I guess as far as multitasking goes, it just seems oddly implemented. But I suppose that argument holds, well put.<br />
Live Tiles are definitely a good thing to have, and I see their use case. I just could not, for the life of me, get myself to use them. That&#8217;s just me, but I was also never a big widget guy either.<br />
Mail, it does everything it needs to, I just noticed it took me longer than normal to get things done. I also dislike the lack of a unified inbox.<br />
It&#8217;s definitely different, and I like that. It changes things up a bit, but I feel like it&#8217;s still a few steps behind. It&#8217;s ALMOST there, but not quite. It&#8217;s not bad, I just couldn&#8217;t see myself using it as a daily driver quite yet.</p>
<p>Oh &#8211; did you try linking the inboxes? It&#8217;s a feature present in Mango&#8230; but it let&#8217;s you have a unified inbox for specified accounts aaaand you can name them!</p>
<p>For instance, I have two unified inboxes, &#8220;Personal&#8221; and &#8220;Work&#8221; for my 5 email acconunts.</p>
<p>Oh seriously? Didn&#8217;t even know, thanks!</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, looks like it had more to do with scalado, than TAT <a href="http://www.scalado.com/display/en/Rewind" target="_blank">http://www.scalado.com/display/en/Rewind</a></p>
<p>its weird cause technically that photo never happened&#8230;.at least not 100% at the exact same time, ya know?</p>
<p>Impressed with the Camera<br />
So So on the keyboard<br />
Not impressed with the user interface looks to confusing</p>
<p>The camera is actually a third party app:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5EcUjwLr9k&feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5EcUjwLr9k&amp;feature=player_embedded</a></p>
<p>i like how everything stays running, hope battery life is decent</p>
<p>Swiping to use a navigation tree is too complex for you? Where do you think OS&#8217;s are going in the future? More grids of icons? Home buttons? Get used to it.</p>
<p>swiping is the future because blackberry has it hahah come on</p>
<p>these devices are going to have to have some pretty crazy processing power and batteries to be able to handle the &#8220;live camera&#8221; aspect (I mean&#8230;HTC&#8217;s One X can only take photos while taking videos, not videos while taking photos). not to mention, every app running all the time without any sort of pausing seems like hell on a battery. the keyboard seems a little odd, and could be frustrating if it misinterprets taps as swipes, but im actually overall surprised by this, it seems like a good update. I just wonder if RIM can actually release it in a timely manner with everything working (looking at you, email and PlayBook 2.0 Software!)</p>
<p>It takes video and shows you one frame, nothing special and i doubt the use of this in RL</p>
<p>Never missed a shot? I think it&#8217;s useful if you can get the interface right.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re taking photos and want to shoot video&#8230; then you switch to video. Duh.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re referring to doing both photos and video at the same time, shoot video first then take your photos&#8230; just like One X can. Double duh.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s referring to the fact that the BB10 camera basically captures a video when you open the camera, except the video is presumably the full camera resolution, rather than mere video resolution.</p>
<p>Triple duh.</p>
<p>thank you for explaining what I could not :) seems terribly inefficient to me, but it is pretty damn cool!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tried webOS then you&#8217;d know RIM&#8217;s multitasking implementation is perfectly feasible.  And honestly nothing could have worse battery life than android.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s feasible but I&#8217;m not sure I like it. I liked the feeling that every open card was a live, running app, but I didn&#8217;t like the fact that when I did toss away a card, when I re-opened the app I was back at the start. Some combination of &#8216;real&#8217; multitasking and fast-resume is best.</p>
<p>That keyboard looks awesome</p>
<p>since when did 3 dots become the universal menu button ?</p>
<p>What are you getting at?</p>
<p>Since it became apart of Android.</p>
<p>Actually windows phone did it first</p>
<p>Tell that to Mobile-Dom and add a picture.</p>
<p>So no picture? This is the internet.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s actually right.  The three dots aren&#8217;t the same implementation as in android, but there are three dots for a menu.  Bottom right corner.</p>

<p>You both are wrong, it wasn&#8217;t WP nor Android those are standardized icons.</p>
<p>Yup..so standard we haven&#8217;t seen them before Wp7 and Android.</p>
<p>So you&#8217;ve never seen this button in your life other than WP7 or Android?<br />
<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Button_ellipsis.png" target="_blank">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Button_ellipsis.png</a></p>
<p>let me explain its meaning then. The three dots are what is known as ellipsis in the English language. It has become a widely used symbol for &#8220;more options/additional input&#8221; in the computer world since the days of the xerox.  If you look even now in your desktop browser you will see that the ellipsis have a meaning in menu items too.  If you click on &#8220;File&#8221;,  or &#8220;Edit&#8221;,  or &#8220;View&#8221; you will see that some options have ellipsis at the end (&#8230;) this signifies that this menu item does not perform an action but has more options you must input.</p>
<p>Edit&gt;Find&#8230; <br />
Tools&gt;Clear Browsing Data&#8230;</p>
<p>The use of ellipsis has been used as a button or appended to menu items for computers for a long  long time and its meaning and  use in the English language obviously even longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use of ellipsis has been used &quot; doesn&#8217;t make sense. ;/<br />
&#8220;The use of ellipsis has been around &quot;<br />
I used the wrong word, sorry.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re an idiot.</p>
<p>I know right, like&#8230; since when did like, Words use to label things? and like, picture made into squares to click on and&#8230;oh gawd, since when did, like, a screen be used to control things.  I mean really&#8230;. Really?  Such a rip off.  Apple invented it.  I mean. Android.  I mean&#8230; what a rip off!</p>
<p>Since Windows Phone introduced it and everybody started getting &#8220;inspired&#8221; by Metro.</p>
<p>God, I hope not.</p>
<p>Microsoft better do something about it because they are going to take all the glory, not Windows Phones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of funny the way fate has reversed msft&#8217;s fortunes and put them in apple&#8217;s position in the desktop market in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Video chat icon denotes BBM Video Chat like on the PlayBook?</p>
<p>at first i hated RIM (i have a bias cause of my messed up BB i guess) but now i kinda hope they do good so we can have 3 or 4 different choices of ecosystems/OSes</p>
<p>More competition is only a good thing, I hope it forces Google to get their fingers out and tell carriers and manufacturers to frankly f**k off and get their act together.<br />
Apple don&#8217;t take any shit, and I don&#8217;t see why Google should either.</p>
<p>I hope to hell they get a unified update mechanism working soon.</p>
<p>Of course, BB 10 may be loaded down with crapware just like Android is.  Given the history of crapware on BB and the relative weakness of RIM when it comes to negotiating with carriers, I expect that ATT will continue to spew suck at consumers.</p>
<p>I really bloody hate carriers, they are there to provide a data network, not shit up phones.</p>
<p>Google really doesn&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass about Android&#8230; beyond its ability to introduce ppl to Google services. Google is still very much an internet advertising firm, that also happens to dabble in a bit of everything. If giving carriers and manufacturers free reign to fiddle with their OS is what it takes to ensure that as many Android phones as possible end up with as many ppl as possible, then so be it.</p>
<p>Which is unfortunate, because while is may be keeping the usercount high, it does make android look crap as a platform.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s also abusive to consumers by handing over power back to the oligopoly- and frankly it&#8217;s evil (as was google&#8217;s flip flop on network neutrality).</p>
<p>I wonder how RIM is going to price this at 149 -199$? At that price range its competing with the iPhone5, Nokia WP8, Galaxy S4 etc I wouldn&#8217;t buy it at a premium price its not worth the 2-3 year investment.</p>
<p>As an aside, it&#8217;s mildly frustrating to see the upcoming iPhone constantly referred to as &#8216;iPhone 5&#8217;. I don&#8217;t mind all the colloquial names of Apple devices (e.g., iTouch, iPad 3, BlackBook, to name a few), but iPhone 5 just makes no sense at all. iPhone 4 was the 4th generation iPhone; iPhone 4S was the 5th gen. Why would they call the 6th gen iPhone 5? My money is on &#8220;the new iPhone&#8221;, year after year going forward. Just like the the rest of Apple&#8217;s products and now the iPad as well.</p>
<p>I agree that it will likely be &#8220;iPhone&#8221; going forward but it&#8217;s completely logical to say &#8220;iPhone 5&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, didn&#8217;t we have iPhone 3G/iPhone 3GS/iPhone 4?</p>
<p>well the iPhone 3g was the second iphone, and the 3gs was the 3rd. So it actually doesn&#8217;t make sense..<br />
1) iPhone<br />
2) iPhone 3g<br />
3) iPhone 3gs<br />
4) iPhone 4<br />
5) iPhone 4s<br />
6) iPhone (should be 6)</p>
<p>1) iPhone<br />
2) iPhone 3g<br />
3) iPhone 3gs<br />
4) iPhone 4<br />
5) iPhone 4s<br />
6) iPhone 6</p>
<p>Do I have to explain to you why you&#8217;re wrong?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re wrong actually.</p>
<p>iPad <br />
iPad 2<br />
iPad</p>
<p>iPhone<br />
iPhone 3G<br />
iPhone 3Gs<br />
iPhone 4<br />
iPhone 4s<br />
iPhone</p>
<p>Who<br />
Really 3G<br />
Cares 2<br />
Anyway 4<br />
They<br />
Will 3GS<br />
Sell 4s<br />
Like<br />
Hot 5<br />
Cakes</p>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;ve been wondering how well Hot Cakes have been selling.</p>
<p>The 3GS and 4S are just minor updates to the previous model and don&#8217;t really reflect a &#8220;refresh&#8221; so technically those don&#8217;t qualify as a &#8220;generation&#8221;.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re being truly anal-retentive:<br />
1) iPhone<br />
2) iPhone 3G/3GS<br />
3) iPhone 4/4S<br />
4) iPhone 4G</p>
<p>Sorry but you&#8217;re incorrect. Your point would be correct if they were called iPhone 3 &#8594; iPhone 3S &#8594; iPhone 4. But they are not &#8211; it&#8217;s &#8216;3G&#8217; not &#8216;3&#8217;, and it refers to 3rd generation cellular networks, not 3rd generation of iPhone.</p>
<p>Among all 5 current generation of the iPhone, only one carried an exclusively numeric (as opposed to alphanumeric) index, and it matched the generation of the device &#8211; that&#8217;s iPhone 4. Alphanumeric index does not have any logical obligation to match the generation, whereas numeric-only does. This in mind, calling it iPhone 5 is illogical.</p>
<p>iPhone 3G was the 2nd iPhone, 3GS the 3rd, iPhone 4 &#8211; guess which &#8211; the 4th!</p>
<p>iPhone 4S was the 5th. So there&#8217;s no way a new iPhone would be called iPhone 5, unless they want their names to not make any sense anymore.</p>
<p>iPhone 5 <br />
4G Connectivity<br />
(6th generation) Makes total sense&#8230;/s</p>
<p>iPhone 4Gs</p>
<p>Well if Apple actually released the iPhone 5 instead of the stupid 4S we wouldn&#8217;t have to be arguing right now, would we?</p>
<p>&#8230;Where by &#8220;released&#8221; you must have meant &#8220;called it&#8221;. Aside from that &#8211; your point, sir, is absolutely correct! ;-)</p>
<p>No, I certainly meant released.</p>
<p>Meaning the refreshed design of the next iPhone (6th gen) is what should have been released last October&#8230; not this &#8220;S update&#8221; garbage, although it stays in line with their 3G&#8594;3GS plan of milking more sales and cutting down production costs.</p>
<p>In my eyes, we shouldn&#8217;t be classifying the 3GS or the 4S as their own generations since they&#8217;re just minor updates. I suppose it&#8217;s like calling HSPA+ a 4G technology.</p>
<p>I think it is going to be called the iPhone 4G or iPhone. (The only thing I am saying it won&#8217;t be is the iPhone 6, of the two, iPhone 5 would be more likely because it would confuse the userbase, going from 4S to 6, probs just call it the new iPhone to line up with the iPad anyways.)</p>
<p>They reincarnated the Samsung Instinct.</p>
<p>A phone that terrible only comes along once in a lifetime.</p>
<p>RIM always over prices things look at the modern blackberry phones they still want $500 usd or more. Its a joke</p>
<p>That look very very intriguing, I&#8217;m definitely more interested in a blackberry device than I have ever been.</p>
<p>Although I wonder how much traction they can get even with a great OS, most people who wanted a smartphone (in the consumer sense) would have jumped on the iOS or Android bandwagon, or to a lesser extent WinMoSev&#8230; Although I suppose they still have the Blackberry enterprise users they can rely on&#8230;</p>
<p>Huge step for RIM. Best of luck to them &#8211; it looks like they&#8217;re finally trying to make a modern phone.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why they only allow 4 apps on the homescreen&#8230;</p>
<p>how many do you want? 26?</p>
<p>Atleast more than 4 I need to see calls, messages, e-mail, calendar, weather etc IMO Live tiles gives me notifications and a good amount of apps on one screen best of both worlds.</p>
<p>It better be customizable. I guessing there&#8217;s only one homescreen?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the main home screen.</p>
<p>RIM has acquired a good batch of companies and unlike APPLE and their restrictive prorietary method of marketing. RIM plans to bring cross platform gaming/developing along with the rich Cascades UI from TAT (which was released today with the keynote) This gives them ample time to gear people up especially with the impressive who of the UI and all the developer support shown today&#8230; We&#8217;re likley to see even more as BBWC and BB10 Jame commence. Gameloft released this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are happy to state that with a very organized developer website, and effective debugging tools, the resources provided to us have enabled us to work quickly and efficiently. Thus, as we are set to optimize 11 new titles from Gameloft covering a variety of genres ranging from hardcore to casual, while also boasting the distinctive social integration of Scoreloop and BlackBerry Messenger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developer support and powerful new hardware/software?<br />
Hmmm waiting has it&#8217;s benefits, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;unlike APPLE and their restrictive prorietary method of marketing&#8221;<br />
OK, that made me laugh.</p>
<p>so how long exactly have you worked at RIM?  LMAO&#8230; did copy and paste that straight from the RIM marketing website?</p>
<p>And that has to do with anything because?</p>
<p>Looks like a matte iPhone without a home button.</p>
<p>looks FANTASTIC!  seriously impressed&#8230;</p>
<p>nice to see RIM innovating again!</p>
<p>did anyone else notice the time on the phone is always 13:37? i think they are using subliminal messaging as well. i wish Blackberry luck with Blackberry 10, the more competition the better. i especially think the way the keyboard does the predictions (over the letters) is a clever idea that will probably be nice for the texters</p>
<p>yeah I saw 1337 too. :)</p>
<p><img src="http://img.ibtimes.com/www/data/images/full/2012/05/01/269100.png" /></p>
<p>RIM should follow their own advice here. I would have waited until I had a solid device and great developer support before I tried to tell everyone else to &#8220;wake up&#8221;. It was RIM who has been sleeping until this point.</p>
<p>Was it ever determined that they were the ones behind it. I read rumors but never saw it confirmed.</p>
<p>I think RIM Australia confirmed it was them that sponsored it. What for I am not sure, wake to up to what exactly? that RIM are late ?</p>
<p>Apparently there was a countdown associated with it, and it was counting down to this BB10 info dump.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some cool looking features there!</p>
<p>Looks nice. I wouldn&#8217;t mind using it, but apps will make or break the platform.</p>
<p>So the best part of the presentation was a 3rd party Android keyboard? Awesome.</p>
<p>Some good ideas here, I am a little worried about all of the gestures. If they aren&#8217;t easily apparent then people won&#8217;t know what to do with them, that being said gestures seemed to be one of the few good things about the Playbook so I am sure they can pull them off in an intuitive way. I very much dislike the home screen, though I am not entirely clear on what determines the apps that will be displayed. I will try and hold out on judging that aspect until we get some more details.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t say I am a huge fan of the (destructive) camera features, I am all for non-destructive photo editing, though the concept is very cool.</p>
<p>I think that RIM is heading in the right direction here, I like what I see. It seems they&#8217;ve taken some of the good from the competition and expanded on some earlier ideas from the Playbook. This is the first product I have seen of RIM&#8217;s in the past two years that seems even remotely relevant. Kudos ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>As many have said though, you can have the best OS in the world but if no body uses it then it doesn&#8217;t mean jack. Apps are where it&#8217;s at and there needs to be interest in the platform/ecosystem as a whole for there to be an app catalog that can compete with Apple and Android. WP is finding this out the hard way.  Your smooth transitions and flowing gestures amount to squat if you don&#8217;t have Draw Something (or whatever the huge app is in a few months). This of course matters much less in the corporate world, but I think the switch we are seeing over to the iPhone has a lot to do with the fact that it&#8217;s a complete package.</p>
<p>It looks like the lastest Meego build&#8230;</p>
<p>1.3 or 1.4?</p>
<p>Will it run Android apps like the playbook??</p>
<p>the keyboard and camera functions are interesting but it seems to remind me of the early Windows Mobile 7 Photon concept that MSFT killed for the metro zune based WP7</p>
<p>This is really well written piece dieter!<br />
Going back on topic, all of this seems like a mishmash of good ideas borrowing from webos and Meego. As meego has the swipe left to right to go to the notifications screen. Also some windows phone inspiration re the home screen . I heard from the swiftkey CMO that they were working with some &#8216;partners&#8217;  with reference to they keyboard. Should be interesting to see how it meshes together. I think execution will be key and timing it too late and would be a major fail too. But even if they have the best interface, without an ecosystem of apps/ services it could be all in vain. I wish them the best of luck, its the most interested I have ever been in BB!</p>
<p>Colour me impressed by camera app&#8217;s memory and keyboard&#8217;s &#8216;swipe up to add word&#8217; functionality.</p>
<p>Thanks for the in depth reports on the new BBos.  Articles like this are becoming hard to find with all the rags like BGR.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Excited for this OS.. Its a huge step in the right direction if the apps are there.  IT sounds like they are trying to get all the devs on board before releasing.. Which is the opposite of how they did it with the release of the playbook.</p>
<p>The most interesting part is if RIM gets this os into all the cars.  If Consumers are &#8220;used&#8221; to this interface and os in their cars and they can share apps, messaging etc with their phones it would pull a lot of people into buying their phones.</p>
<p>I think Rim is looking beyond phones and tablets with their os, and i suspect there may be future announcements about partnerships with Car manufactures.  All BB devices tied together with the BB network etc. Hope it all works out.</p>
<p>it won&#8217;t pause the apps in the background, ALL apps will continue to run&#8230;..but like many of the BB users are already used to&#8230;..regularly do a &#8220;quick battery pull&#8221;.</p>
<p>As much as I hate RIM, the camera app was brilliant. Everything else was&#8230;meh.</p>
<p>I think they worked very hard at this. Building something new while getting inspiration from what works is a balancing act. They should be commended, as building a full fledged OS is a daunting task, especially under financial pressure. That they can innovate on something like the camera app and keyboard prediction while other players have had many iterations of their devices to think about such things is very telling of what RIM stands for.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called innovation. And it&#8217;s never too late for that.</p>
<p>Looks great. I love my playbook running OS2 and I guess I won&#8217;t be buying a new tablet anytime soon since they will bring BB10 to playbooks as well.</p>
<p>Ah, so they just completely ripped off Windows Phone. Congratulations RIM. Next time try some originality rather than ripping off a competitor. That is weak sauce.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s a very unfair comment..<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
&#8230;they also ripped off WebOS..</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t rip off something that&#8217;s considered dead.</p>
<p>What about Elvis impersonators?</p>
<p>But where&#8217;s the keyboard&#8230;</p>
<p>Tiles! psssh! Tiles are fugly! Tiles are stupid!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why every other OEM is making UI&#8217;s with tiles!</p>
<p>I bet when the first caveman showed off his round wheel, there was a couple of neanderthals standing aroudn going &#8220;Round? Pssh. Round will never work&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting but the app situation needs to improve</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in how apps are going to run on this full screen device and Blackberrys with qwerty keyboards and much smaller screens.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising that they licensed SwiftKey for the PlayBook but for BlackBerry 10 they&#8217;ve developed a new keyboard (which looks a lot worse to be honest).</p>
<p>RIM really needed to show a prototype device today and they didn&#8217;t that<br />
suggests they&#8217;re rather far behind and imo the chances of a BBX device<br />
this year are likely to be slim or insanely limited</p>
<p>that explains why their shares took a bit of a hit today<br />
 </p>
<p>what a shame as BBX looks great, hopefully BBX will still have an impact a year from now when we finally see devices</p>
<p>show a prototype? they are GIVING prototypes to all the Devs at BBJAM, get your facts straight.</p>
<p>prototype retail device not a friggen developer mule device</p>
<p>So glad there isn&#8217;t a physical keyboard on this. Most annoying thing ever listening to someone type on a BB <del>_</del> loving the look of this and the camera face change ability is sweet!</p>

<p>That camera app will be out for Androids play soon&#8230;its Scalado rewind.  <a href="http://www.scalado.com/display/en/Rewind" target="_blank">http://www.scalado.com/display/en/Rewind</a></p>
<p>yes the gutter picks up everything</p>
<p>Of course, competition is a good thing, but this will fail. Developers won&#8217;t be keen on going to a fourth platform, particularly a latecomer, and it will struggle without developer support. RIM is still quite out-of-touch, they need to get a grip, even if they&#8217;ve made something vaguely pretty (not as nice-looking as WinPho, Android 4.0, or even iOS IMO).</p>
<p>If the tools are easy to develop with then why would developers resist moving to create apps for RIM as well? It opens up their apps to new customers. On top of that it seems more logical for people trying to get into the game of app developing to go for the underdog. Their apps will stand out more as they have less competition.</p>
<p><img src="http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/articles/58424-image/london-b.jpg" /></p>
<p>Hold onto some hope. RIM really is holding a lot back. ;)<br />
Compare the UI&#8217;s they&#8217;re nothing a like. Expect BB10 to look dramatically different when it&#8217;s actually released. That keynote looked like a bunch of TAT concept stuff just to excite us the real thing will be much more robust.</p>
<p>Oh Gawd, you had me until you added the &#8220;Blackberry Bumper Bling&#8221;  at the top and bottom. Couldn&#8217;t they have been a tad more subtle. Hopefully this mockup is just that &#8211; a mockup and not coming to market. Gau-dy.</p>
<p>Looks very promising actually, would be nice to have something push the iPhone at last.</p>
<p>Props to RIM for getting their shit together.  I&#8217;m sure it will take a while for people to look at BB again though (since it seems like most people have only recently begun to see them as dated&#8230; a little late, no?).</p>
<p>Never owned a RIM product, but every time I&#8217;ve played around with a PlayBook, I&#8217;ve been really impressed.</p>
<p>Im curious as to if loyal blackberry fans like or hate the new user interface. I would think if i were a blackberry fan i would like it because it works a certain way and the only negative i can think of with this new redesign of the ui is are they going ti alienate their core users by conpletely changing how blackberry looks and feels to something very alien to what blackberry users are currently used to.</p>

<p>Anyone else notice that in the 2 pictures below the video the time on the BlackBerry device is 13:37?</p>
<p>That development device used for the demo is sweet. RIM should really keep it make sure it has that gun-metal colour, polish it, add logos, buttons, etc. and release that when BB 10 comes out! No seriously.</p>
<p>for a development alpha device it certainly blows any current bb os out of the water without even trying, well done rim</p>
<p>Looks promising from what they gave us so far. I like the rewind camera feature, just hope it doesn&#8217;t kill the battery. Also, I wonder how many full apps will run in the background.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a step in the right direction, this is really a make it or break it for RIM, and i&#8217;d like to see them succeed. The APPS are going to be what does it, so we can hope for some great future support (and yay for competition).</p>
<p>When Steve Jobs said iPhone (2007) is at least 5 years ahead of the leaders in the industry, I can now see exactly what he meant.</p>
<p>He predicted it perfectly.  WP8, BB10, and even openWebOS are being released late 2012, just a little over 5 years since the iPhone&#8217;s introduction.</p>
<p>Nice cool additions with the camera and keyboard, but what I remember most about BB&#8217;s OS was the confusing OS.  I&#8217;ll have to see someone navigate around the OS (especially the settings)  to see if they&#8217;ve really improved.</p>
<p>Also, they&#8217;ll need specs that can at least match up to what WP7 or iPhones have.</p>
<p>thank god there&#8217;s autocorrect for letters. but what about it for numbers?</p>
<p>This actually looks good. Too bad it&#8217;s 3-4 years too late.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious what does that even mean?  If RIM releases this late 2012 are you not going to buy it simply because it&#8217;s &#8220;too late&#8221;?</p>
<p>It means they should have done a similar OS years ago, but they were too stubborn and stuck in their ways. If they did start this in 2008-2009 they would of had less users flock to iOS and Android. Also, with more users, they would actually have some sort of app ecosytem. I&#8217;m saying RIM missed the boat. Thus far, WP7 and WebOS have proven that you can make a amazing OS, but if you don&#8217;t have an ecosystem, your far behind.</p>
<p>According to the video, it says that all of the apps on the phone are running at the same time. Anybody else worried about battery life on this puppy?</p>
<p>I will say, the camera on this thing &#8211; with the ability to go back and alter an image with another existing image with ease using the camera itself? Too freaking cool.</p>
<p>Use webOS.  It&#8217;s possible.</p>
<p>i wonder if you can exit out of them like playbook or webos</p>
<p>This is definitely a step in the right direction. If BB10 can get the essential apps I use regularly, I could give this platform a go.</p>
<p>When I view the &#8220;flow&#8221; concept for app switching and bringing up the charms I am instantly reminded of the swipe concept from Meego. To my mind, gestures are a more natural way of navigating an interface versus buttons or dialogue boxes. While I hope Nokia willintegrate swipe into WP8, BB10 just may fill that void for me. Let&#8217;s hope the final hardware is killer.</p>
<p>Dual-core cortex A15 please.</p>
<p> We should all be hoping that RIM succeeds. No one device or service meets everyones needs. And the competition spurs innovation. Which company ripped off what UI elements or features are an argument for RIM, Goggle, Microsoft and Apple to work out.</p>
<p>I like how all the screenshots were taken at leet&#8217;o&#8217;clock, hahaha&#8230;Blackberry&#8217;s attempt to look modern and in touch.</p>
<p>nifty camera app.</p>
<p>The keyboard auto-complete gestures are genius!<br />
Really liking this so far,  can&#8217;t wait to hear more from RIM.</p>
<p>My thoughts on BB10:</p>
<p>1.) Some seemingly great innovations on keyboard speed and accuracy.  <br />
2.) The camera app looks really wonderful.<br />
3.) Ecosystem is huge (see WP7&#8217;s bain).<br />
4.) Apple and Google will absorb some of this greatness (see Apple&#8217;s Android notifications and Android 4.0&#8217;s lock screen).<br />
5.) Will RIM be able to keep it&#8217;s corporate customers?  Our workplace still issues Blackberry Bolds, and will not support anything else.  Is this a big perk?</p>
<p>WebOS indeed. Is that the Avenir fontface?</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I&#8217;m actually digging the UI. And I think that hardware is super sexy. I know it&#8217;ll never be released but I just eat that super minimalism up. Same with that Google Chromebook rom a while ago&#8230;</p>
<p>Seems like everyone is standardizing on 720p, except, for Apple.</p>
<p>&gt;IMPLYING</p>
<p>Apple isn&#8217;t gonna increase their screen size by 20% in both X and Y, it would blow their scaling completely.  Or look wierd if they just centered the 960&#215;640 apps on the 1280&#215;720 screen.</p>
<p>They are going to 1134 &#215; 640 for the new iphone so it will be 16&#215;9 but they arent bumping it up to 720p which they should</p>
<p>Why should they?  At their screen size, that res is great</p>
<p>It will still be higher density than most other smartphones, since the screen is smaller</p>
<p>1136&#215;640 actually. BUT WHO CARES RIGHT.</p>
<p>There are so many complications to account for as far as UI if they go 720p that it&#8217;s probably not worth it. The OS scales nicely as far as vertical space since most things are list-based so that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>No, but theoretically they could increase the pixel density of the rumored size to around 367ppi and that would make it 720p.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t make sense to do it, and wouldn&#8217;t have a great benifit either, so it wouldn&#8217;t make sense</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, probably not (initially anyway), given the burden on designers and developers. But Apple have done crazier things.</p>
<p>Let me rephrase that&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Retina&#8221; is 300PPI, so from Apple&#8217;s perspective increasing the PPI further would have a negligible benefit.  Any minor improvements would be offset by the headache of updating apps to the new screen resolution and PPI.  Remember everything would be smaller if they just centered it so all elements would need to be scaled up some 20%.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s not.  The definition of retina is based on the laws of physics and the resolving power of the human eye.  This formula takes into account distance.  That&#8217;s why the retina macbook pro and iPad3 aren&#8217;t 300 ppi but still legitimately called retina.</p>
<p>After you pass these limits of the human eye there is a huge drop off in the diminishing returns of increasing ppi.  The only legitimate use I&#8217;ve seen is rendering special characters/languages like arabic and japanese.  The drawbacks are cost, difficulty of manufacture, and battery usage.</p>
<p>Retina for phones is around 300PPi&#8230; I should have wrote that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m English speaking, so I can&#8217;t really read and tell much difference between different characters in chinese, Japanese, etc but they did look quite sharp and with lots of detail on iPhone 4/4Ss to me.  I&#8217;ve never heard of my friends who use those languages complain either.  I have a feeling until it makes sense to skip up to something like 1440&#215;960 (1707&#215;960 for 16:9) that Apple will hold on to their 326PPI, that way scaling will be easier</p>
<p>I agree.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.techsmart.co.za/data/articles/Japan%20Display%20Inc%20unveils%20display%20with%20651%20ppi%20count/images/JDI_new_651_ppi_display_inline_image.JPG" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t read either language but it&#8217;s obviously adding some fidelity to characters.  Few people&#8217;s eyes would be sharp enough to notice.  I brought this up as the only example I know of a reason to go beyond retina.  It&#8217;s also a very small difference.</p>
<p>Well that may look like a big difference when you&#8217;re sitting up close to a monitor, when you back up so that the scale is the same size as a 3 mm object, it&#8217;s pretty much impossible tell the difference between those.</p>
<p>I agree.  I bring this up because people keep saying that the phone should match 720p, a common video resolution.  The benefit you&#8217;ll gain there is probably not even a 10th of what you see here.  And what you see here is tiny.</p>
<p>But, it&#8217;s a small screen, a phone. 720P is ridiculous for a screen so small. On a larger screen, that&#8217;s great. The iPhone can already output 1080P for watching on a larger screen. That&#8217;s what really maters.</p>
<p>Now change the  size so that those 3mm are actually 3mm. Will a human eye make out the difference?</p>
<p>651PPI, wow&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see those two side by side, that would really put the whole &#8220;retina&#8221; theory to the test.</p>
<p>True retina is actually ALOT higher, somewhere around 900 ppi. Please see this article on some of the benefits.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/173702/why-retina-isnt-enough-feature/" target="_blank">http://www.cultofmac.com/173702/why-retina-isnt-enough-feature/</a></p>
<p>Dude, I&#8217;m agreeing with you!</p>
<p>I wrote it way too fast so I totally skipped my point and what I wrote was crap, I intended to have it before you replyed but it didn&#8217;t end up that way&#8230;. nothing related to:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;You’re right, probably not (initially anyway), given the burden on designers and developers. But Apple have done crazier things.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Sorry haha</p>
<p>Hah! Ok, no worries.</p>
<p>right now that would make no sense for apple.. the costs for those displays would be way higher than what the have now due to economies of scale.. they might do it a few generations down the line.. or they might just use the current tech and resize the display once more while reducing the bezel to get to 1280 by 720 without compromising on size and one-handed usability.. then again.. i don&#8217;t see the benefit to apple to even go there.. apps are developed for ios first.. so they are being developed at their chosen resolution.. everything else is adapted afterwards..</p>
<p>Well it seems obvious 720p is a pretty popular resolution for media and on mobile devices it is pretty high resolution</p>
<p>&gt;ESTABLISHING :D</p>
<p>Yeah, cause one should limit themselves to &#8216;standardizing&#8217;  some random resolution when making the best possible products + innovating. 720P is irrelevant except when it comes to HDTVs, etc. On mobile devices it means nothing. I&#8217;d like Apple to use the resolution it considers to be optimal for its next phone, not 720 just because. Also, the iPad destroys that resolution so I&#8217;m glad its not &#8216;standard&#8217;.</p>
<p>720P is not random: It&#8217;s 16:9 and seems to strike the right balance between &#8216;retina&#8217; and overkill. Lastly, it&#8217;s a perfect fit for all the 720p movies on the web. Not saying, it&#8217;s the final solution, but I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with it.  Besides, isn&#8217;t it great to have standards? Even if they HAD picked a random resolution and standardized it.. at least it&#8217;s standardized!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re also assuming that Apple will choose the optimal solution for their next phone.  I think this is being too naive. I think, more accurately, that Apple will do whatever it takes to differentiate themselves from competitors, even if messes up the standards. In other words, make their own ecosystem as seperated from the rest as possible.</p>
<p>On that size of screen you can scale down 720p and you&#8217;d need a jewelers loupe to see any difference in a paused shot.  That&#8217;s also assuming your video is perfectly compressed.</p>
<p>Having a screen that is 720 pixels tall when in landscape mode does not mean the screen is 16:9. Panels can be cut in any size to any ratio. &#8216;P&#8217; indicates a progressive (non-interlaces) video format and it gibberish to refer to this when referring to a smartphone screen.</p>
<p>Except the nexus 7, so nobody really.</p>
<p>Windows 8 is standardizing on 768p (13368768)</p>
<p>I really hope RIM makes a decent come back with BB10. It&#8217;s of no use to a lot of people who will lose their jobs and to consumers if they cannot have added variety with Blackberry on the market. They still have some strong markets outside the US and they must capitalize on It fast and introduce all touch screen phones there before those markets move on as well.</p>
<p>Gonna be really tough without a lot of good apps.</p>
<p>RIM has been hosting dozen off developer events over the recent months, apps right now aren&#8217;t a problem as more developers are getting on board.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think apps are as big of a problem as getting the carriers to give a crap about them again.  RIM has no retail presence and I don&#8217;t know why carriers would support them when they undoubtedly make a higher margin on a Samsung phone.</p>
<p>RIM is screwed unless they can score a big licensee.  I have no clue who that could be.  They should be sending fruit baskets and flowers to all the HTC execs they know.</p>
<p>What are you talking about carriers don&#8217;t care, do you work with the carriers to know this information? Wait and see before you jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>The carriers already don&#8217;t care about blackberry.  Verizon and AT&amp;T have marketing budgets that they use to advertise partner phones.  I haven&#8217;t seen them talking up BB in quite some time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just looking at the facts.  There is absolutely no way RIM can match the prestige of Apple or scale of Samsung.  They may be able to sell some phones but they need to completely change their business model to support their existing workforce with income from lower end devices than they were traditionally used to as well as a huge drop off in the fees they charge for enterprise integration.  They&#8217;re already signaling this change in their CEO&#8217;s statements about &#8220;licensing to anyone&#8221;.   He&#8217;s throwing out a rope and praying someone grabs on.</p>
<p>Yesterday RIM reported that they were getting ready beta devices to demonstrate to carriers, there is no doubt in my mind that the carriers are gonna turn down RIM&#8217;s BB10 phones. A report last week also said Verizon is already gearing up to market BB10 when its released, so some carriers are already getting on-board. If carrier only cared about making money why not toss HTC since they aren&#8217;t really selling much phones.</p>
<p>Obviously RIM isn&#8217;t gonna become the top dog in the market overnight. When the CEO said licensing he wasn&#8217;t talking about BB10, he was referring to QNX which BB10 is being built on, as its already being used by some car manufactures since last year.</p>
<p>A carrier isn&#8217;t going to outright say, &#8220;we don&#8217;t want your phones anymore&#8221;.  But they won&#8217;t be spending millions on commercials and they will be shoving blackberries into a dark corner of their stores.  Verizon OWNS the Droid brand so who are they going to push?</p>
<p>The problem is RIM is a company that was built to sell and support a large marketshare.  In a couple years they&#8217;ll be just barely scraping by with a single digit marketshare, if they&#8217;re lucky.  Good luck continuing future development in direct competition with the staff at Apple and Google.  The entire company is going to come down to the values of their patents in an acquisition because no one wants their customer base, expertise, staff, relationships, anything.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m mistaken most of the Blackberry commercials are in fact done by RIM itself and not the carriers.</p>
<p>BB10 is a make it or break it, everyone already knows this so you are just preaching old news now.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true for some but not all ads.  RIM is welcome to do all the advertising they want but that won&#8217;t get their posters inside carrier stores.  AT&amp;T puts a lot of their own money behind advertising for the iPhone in their stores, on billboards, and in various forms of media.  That money used to go towards the BB Curve.  RIM&#8217;s never getting it back.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call it make it or break it.</p>
<p>I would compare RIM to the 2012-13 Dallas Mavericks.  They may have won a championship a few years ago but their only chance to win in the near future is for a meteor to annihilate their competition.</p>
<p>Lol</p>
<p>Outside the US RIM is doing ok, even if BB10 isn&#8217;t a big success in the US it will strengthen their hold in the oversea markets.</p>
<p>Current BlackBerry phones doesn&#8217;t represent the kind of phones that are bought by mainstream customers at the moment. They are out of fashion. That is the reason why carriers don&#8217;t push them any more. But the thing carriers aren&#8217;t interested in, is an Apple-Samsung-duopoly. Carriers WANT BB10 to succeed, they already said that. And they also said that they&#8217;re very excited for the platform. When a new platform hits the market, especially one made by a such well-known manufacturer like RIM, and especially one that is obviously different from the competition like BB10, it catches much attention and people are interested. And I also think many people are getting a bit bored of the well established ones, interested in something new. And when BB10 launches in January, the flagship SGS3 and all big Android has to offer is already well known, the 6th gen iPhone also, same with Windows Phone 8. The public noise around these 3 will be flattened down at that time. There&#8217;s no better moment to launch a new platform and BB10 will get a lot of noise and it will be surely supported by carriers. In no way will BB10 be shoved in dark corners of carriers stores.</p>
<p>Developers go where the money is and right now that is iOS and Android.  Even Windows Phone 8 will have a larger installed base before BB10 comes out.  It&#8217;ll just be very tough to catch up.</p>
<p>In theory that is correct that&#8217;s why RIM is having these developer conferences they have been giving away up to $10,000 to developers who make quality and approved apps. And apps are already being developed so even if BB10 isn&#8217;t out yet apps are already being developed for it.</p>
<p>Developers go where the money is&#8230;.you would say. But in fact, BlackBerry App World generates 40% more revenue than the Google PlayStore with apps (that was at least the case in Q4/2011). The money is definetely in there in BlackBerry App World, because there you have more payment options and the users spend more money, developers can charge higher prices. The reason why many developers didn&#8217;t code for BlackBerry in the past, is that the tools weren&#8217;t that good as they are for iOS or Android. Developing for BB-Phones (up to v7.1) is much more complicated and needs much more effort. But with BB10 it&#8217;ll be the other way around. While the money is still there, RIM is providing excellent tools and it&#8217;s easy to build native apps with rich graphics, just like it is on iOS. Not to forget the Android-compatibility and other supported development platforms. Additionally RIM is strongly investing in developer relations since may of this year.</p>

<p>Sadly, when I look at standardised resolutions, all I think of is the impression that Windows Phone makes now compared to the other displays on the market. Sure it was great on release, but a few years on? Standardising a display size is an easy way to get beaten in a market where display technology is advancing continuously.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s alls about pixel density. And whereas RIM won&#8217;t build phones with 4,5&quot; and larger screens, 720p will be just fine.</p>
<p>720&#215;720 on a 2.8&quot; screen is going to be beast PPI</p>
<p>When I first read it my first thought was &#8220;square blackberry?&#8221;</p>
<p>720&#215;720 Is not 16&#215;9.</p>
<p>No shit.</p>
<p>huh?</p>
<p>Nice looking phone Apples lawyer are probably already building a case against it.</p>
<p>just a reference design</p>
<p>developer phone rather*</p>
<p>This is an interesting point in the corporate and mobile phone history, two companies at a crosspoint, Nokia and RIM. One decided to stick with their own thing and build their own OS, the other gave up and went with the third party.</p>
<p>Whose decision will turn out to be the correct one in the end?</p>
<p>OH MAN, LOOK; BB made an iPhone. Barcode for a home button? Clever, clever.</p>
<p>Its a Developer phone&#8230;</p>
<p>rImming is cool :-p</p>
<p>Poor std track record in Sweden.</p>
<p>BlackBerry <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/">Cascades</a> and <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/">Webworks</a> both have tools for dynamic resolution development, multiple resolutions will be much easier to develop for.</p>
<p>windows phone.</p>
<p>Since when did dev&rsquo;s pull some bullshit like this &mdash; &ldquo;wait-and-see approach&rdquo;  just put the app out with Ads and let it generate $$.   This is very elitist move for them to make themselves feel superior.</p>

<p>Nice blog. Now give me back my name!</p>
<p>;D</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple explanation here&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s moronic.</p>
<p>that is beyond ridiculous&hellip;.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;re not Michael Li or his boss, because as a tech writer, he doesn&rsquo;t seem like he&rsquo;s the most insightful writer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While BlackBerry announced top apps such as Angry Birds, Kindle, <span class="caps">SAP</span>, Skype and Whatsapp for BB 10, Instagram was conspicuously missing.  Multiple <span class="caps">RIM</span> insiders have confirmed to us that a native BB 10 version of Instagram has been ready for months.  However, Microsoft has been using its 1.6% ownership of Facebook and its strategic alliance with the social media giant to prevent Instagram from launching on BB 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lemme get this straight, this person is saying that the only reason that instagram isn&rsquo;t coming to BB10 is because <span class="caps">MSFT</span> are pulling these strings behind the scenes? You would think that if they were pulling strings, they could pull strings to actually have an app made on their platform that&rsquo;s actually selling far better. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because multiple analysts have recently cut forecasts of BB10 sales in Q1 2013 from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/benzingainsights/2013/02/20/blackberry-10-may-have-been-an-enormous-record-breaking-flop/">1.75 million to 300k</a>? At that rate, Nokia alone is selling more windows phones per week (on average) than Blackberry 10 devices for the entirety of the quarter. If it really came down to development costs and not the amount of users, they have around $60 billion in cash on hand, I&rsquo;m pretty sure if they wanted to get instagram, they would just pay facebook to do it, or do it themselves like the native FB app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an owner of a Nokia Lumia 920 (and former owner of a <span class="caps">HTC</span> 8X), Windows Phone 8 has some potential.  In fact, the Xbox app is Microsoft&rsquo;s best hope.  However, the fact that Microsoft is not a mobile company really reveals itself in WP 8, in the form of numerous inconveniences.  When the Lumia 920 (or <span class="caps">HTC</span> 8X) is compared to the BlackBerry Z10 (with its BlackBerry Hub, Flow and Peek) it is clear that BB 10 will win this battle by a wide margin.  Ultimately, BlackBerry understands and fully embraces mobile, while Microsoft is becoming more irrelevant every day in the post-PC world.</p>

<p>Is this a satire based website, like The Onion?</p>
<p>satire</p>
<p>that site isn&rsquo;t reliable.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re an idiot, and your blog is idiotic.</p>
<p>Its not elistist at all. They have to devote significant manpower and money to develop 2 clients already, keep features in sync, and conduct bug fixes, etc. Wait and see is the perfect approach because its not just about kicking out a client and reaping money with ads. Its about doing it right and devoting effort to a platform that has steam. Call me a troll but BB10 has no steam. When you blow tons of cash for a Superbowl ad which does nothing to explain why your product is better than a free iPhone 4 (on contract) then you have <span class="caps">LOST</span>. Its actually fairly obvious why companies are not releasing BB10 native apps.</p>
<p>I am an android fanboy, but was actually pleased when apple announced the free iPhone 4. It meant all these companies producing crap android phones for free on contract were forced to step up their game. BB, by announcing they wouldn&rsquo;t release in the <span class="caps">USA</span> until march, and delaying the Q10 beyond that, which is arguably the only model a BB purest cares about, was a fail.</p>
<p>cool story bro&hellip;Instagram is coming to BB10, it will be a Android version but optimized to say the least</p>
<p>Yea it will come to bb as piracy just like most android ports the dev doesn&#8217;t even know and crackberry.com continues to market these apps in which the companies have not allowed them to do so</p>
<p>It will generate less $$ and have less users than iOS and Android versions so it will naturally have less quality. If quality matters to you then you will wait and see</p>
<p>Elitist is hardly the word for it. If you&rsquo;re a developer and you sink a bunch of time and money into an app on a new platform that doesn&rsquo;t gain any ground, it&rsquo;s a wasted effort.</p>
<p>The same could ironically be said about consumers too. I&rsquo;d really like what Microsoft is doing with Win8 but the momentum on apps isn&rsquo;t there. Prime example is the Netflix app. Compare the windows phone version to the Android and iOS version; it looks 3 years out of date. Even their list of &ldquo;essential apps&rdquo; contains third party versions of dropbox, instagram, and pandora.</p>
<p>@onysi: WP doesnt have Instagram either.</p>
<p>just throwing it out there for the devs.  i&rsquo;m sure they lurk around here.</p>
<p>well this confirms no windows phone version either since windows phone sells <span class="caps">LESS</span> than blackberry</p>
<p>rip windows phone</p>
<p>Instagram is coming to BB10, it will not be a sub par experience as the author is talking about but an optimized version. Look&rsquo;s like a slow day for Chris Welch and trolling</p>
<p>First it was going to be there on release day&hellip;.then it was guaranteed to be coming&hellip;then it was they are discussing it with the developer&hellip;blah blah blah</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not coming until Facebook gives their stamp of approval on the android port!</p>
<p>forget it. wp will never get instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Is</strong> it such a"glaring hole?"</p>
<p>for the amount of people that use instagram? absolutely.</p>
<p>no point expending resources to build an app that only used by &gt;10,000 phones.</p>
<p>compare to millions in iOS and Android</p>
<p>last time I checked Blackberry sold 7.5 million devices last quarter and not to mention with no new products in the last 18 months</p>
<p>we have 7.5 million blackberry fans here keeping the company alive =P</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re talking about how many Z10s and Q10s sold?</p>
<p>Instagram is an important app if they want to keep someone interested in switching to BB10. When people consider which apps they would need BB10 to support before taking the plunge into the BlackBerry world, Instagram would certainly be one of the apps that they&rsquo;d want to see in App World.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not crucial because of the filters, or the square image format.  It&rsquo;s crucial because a lot of people use it, a lot of their friends are on it, it&rsquo;s easy to upload these photos to FaceBook, and lots of people use FaceBook.  Their usefulness is all interrelated.</p>
<p>Instagram is coming to BB10, some beta testers already has the app</p>
<p>Do you have any blurrycam shots to prove this, blurrycam?</p>
<p>Exactly my sister in law asked about wp8 devices recently than asked does it have instagram I said no and next thing you know she buys an android phone. Its kind of crazy that its important but people don&#8217;t want to feel left out.</p>
<p>BB needs to open a fund to help pay for dev time for these kinds of apps. These kinds of apps will make/break the deal for many users who might consider buying one of their devices.</p>
<p>I follow a lot of blogs, and a lot of people that used to actively publish on blogger &amp; tumblr now primarily use instagram. It fits the niche for blogs, twitter, and facebook. People like photos &ndash; they tell a story faster than any other media. The filters just add a fun factor to it. It&rsquo;s hands down one of the best mediums for insta-blogging if you will. Instead of taking pictures with <span class="caps">DSLR</span>, editing them, posting them, and writing an article, bloggers now upload one photo with a quick description, and it does just enough justice.</p>
<p>I was legitimately shocked BB10 didn&rsquo;t come out the gates with Instagram. It is one of the most important social networks as of late.</p>
<p>In ur face BB :)</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Whether its an android port or a native app. They will be getting it <span class="caps">BEFORE</span> Windows Phone. That is crucial for claiming the 3rd spot.</p>
<p><b>Kicks back&hellip; waits for BB Fanboys to tell us how much it doesn&rsquo;t matter&hellip;. and How there are &ldquo;Alternatives&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>poor reading comprehension? Instagram is coming to BB10 but will not be a native version but an Android port optimized for BB10</p>
<p>Lol &ldquo;Optimized&rdquo; android port. All those horrible ports will soon start looking like early android app ecosystem.</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;optimized Android apps&rdquo;.</p>
<p>2.3 Droid Sans font and all. <strong>rolls eyes</strong></p>
<p>I wonder why &ndash; <em>cough</em> <a href="http://www.thegadgetmasters.com/2013/01/31/exclusive-microsoft-betrays-blackberry-as-battle-to-become-3-mobile-os-officially-kicks-off/">Microsoft</a>. The app was already made for BB10. Microsoft is just holding it back.</p>
<p>On another note &ndash; people are still using Instagram?</p>
<p>Instagram is twitter for people who can&rsquo;t read.  Just kidding.  My daughter is hooked on it, but I don&rsquo;t allow her to have a Facebook id so that&rsquo;s her only social media source.</p>
<p>Would you care to explain with facts?</p>
<p><strong>Cough</strong> Idiot <strong>Cough</strong></p>
<p>I have used an iphone and an android phone for years without instagram and my life is not incomplete. Why should that change with the Blackberry Z10? Instagram is overhyped.</p>
<p>Ok thats fine for you but you cant ignore millions of users.  There will always be the people that dont use X product or service out of millions that do.  I was once one of the "I dont use instagram " people but that doesnt make the app any less important to ecosystems.</p>
<p>Fair point.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not a fair point, I ignore billions of internet users all the time, see&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. that was me ignoring them, it&rsquo;s realllly easy.</p>
<p>Do you have something you need to sell to millions? If so, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll get very far ignoring the billions.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t get it&hellip; If you need the app, <span class="caps">WRITE</span> IT <span class="caps">YOURSELF</span>, Blackberry.  Pay whatever licensing fee you need to and create the apps you need to get your ecosystem going.  MS did this a little, but I don&rsquo;t know why they didn&rsquo;t do it more.  It&rsquo;s not like Instagram will say &lsquo;No, you can&rsquo;t write our app for us&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>Does instagram provide API&rsquo;s for developers? Not sure if that was the case we would have seen plenty of awesome instagram native apps similar to many twitter clients.</p>
<p>They let you browse the feeds and profiles, but not upload.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly what they will say, the last thing they want are users of the &lsquo;other&rsquo; platforms bitching and blaming Instagram for a sub-par divergent experience compared to what exists on Android and iOS. Instagram does have a brand and reputation to protect.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re right, taking photos and putting them on the internets is a &ldquo;premium&rdquo; experience that nobody ever thought of before, apart from everybody who thought of it before them that is.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what argument you&rsquo;re trying to make here.</p>
<p>Idiot alert.</p>
<p>I think the <em>real</em> problem here is that Instagram is somehow important. It&rsquo;s tragic to think that a platform could be damaged because an app as banal as Instagram isn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s no point in having a social-networking app when there are not enough people to share with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not strictly about Instragram. It&rsquo;s the (what seems to be correct, at least at this point) notion that BB10 will be missing lots of popular apps.</p>
<p>If you use things like FaceBook, Instagram, Twitter, and Skype, they&rsquo;re all important.</p>
<p>The fact that they can be so intermingled makes them all important.  I use Facebook and Instagram, and it&rsquo;s so easy to take a photo and have it appear on your FB profile that I see it as an essential part of FaceBook itself.  I don&rsquo;t even see it as a separate app.</p>
<p>Why oh why must people care about things I don&rsquo;t care about :()</p>
<p>I mean if only people hadn&rsquo;t wanted to run office back in 1993 Linux on the desktop would have trounced Windows.  It&rsquo;s tragic that a platform was damaged because an app as bad as Word 6.0 wasn&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>Still waiting for that promised windows phone app.</p>
<p>I feel a bit stupid having to point this out, but nobody cares what language is used for development of the app&hellip;</p>
<p>U beat me to it. THis silly article is written as if there are users who are going to say, hey I&rsquo;m not getting a BLackberry because their instagram app is ported and not written in native code. This might be possibly the dumbest article ever. But, when it comes to bashing Blackberry, tech writings know no bounds.</p>
<p>You might want to research what ported Android apps are like before commenting.</p>
<p>If I write it in one language and it&rsquo;s fast and you write it in another and it&rsquo;s slow and buggy I guess you will care. If one App is able totake advantage of a platforms unique Integration features and another isn&rsquo;t you will care.</p>
<p>The choice of using a compatibility layer with original code or having an App taylored to the system does make a big difference.</p>
<p>Blackberry 10 responded in a statement &ldquo;Big f****** whoop B*tch, I can still take photos and put them on the internet so f*** you, b*tch.&rdquo;, before sauntering off.</p>
<p>MS, Nokia and BB should join hands with Yahoo and promote the hell out of the original photographic social network, Flickr. Flickr should improve its social side. They don&rsquo;t discriminate against anybody. May be Yahoo can run a campaign saying &lsquo;Capture, Share, Discover and Socialise on your platform of choice! Not ours!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Its not about pictures but the social network</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have a BB10 myself&hellip; but it would be nice if instagram tried innovating a bit, by trying out a version on BB10 that can take advantage of that unique camera feature.</p>
<p>What unique camera feature?</p>
<p>TimeShift. Yes there are alternatives to that on Samsung and Nokia phones, but its best implemented on BlackBerry 10.</p>
<p>This is what happens when apps go Hollywood</p>
<p>meh, you can keep instagram</p>
<p>I could be wrong, as this was told to me by someone else. They said Instagram took off on iOS because at the time it was one of the only ways to quickly share photos, or that type of integration. It was a way of sharing photos, meaning a bunch, that was as simple as it was on BlackBerries, which is quite easy. <br />
However, it&rsquo;s obvious Instagram has become so much more, an entire platform and one of those things needed to convince someone to switch, something not to lose by switching platforms. Having a camera with built-in filters which can be easily posted to Facebook isn&rsquo;t enough, for most people. Same result, just not the name. <br />
All that being said, with the rate that those working at BlackBerry are building and improving the BB10 OS, ported apps should drastically improve soon. I do wish it was native, would feel better to pretentiously dismiss instagram and its filters that way :)</p>
<p>Instagram should have been available for BB10 at launch.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care about instagram because of their practices in stealing people&rsquo;s pics and making it their own, not to mention they sell your info.</p>

<p>*If you turn off the phone and only look at the top half.</p>
<p>Galaxy Nexus. &lt;3</p>
<p>wait, this is all sarcasm right?</p>
<p>this is a pretty good looking device&#8230;do you prefer a nondescript black glass slab? because that is done and played, its nice for video, it sucks to type on.</p>
<p>this device is reminiscent of old blackberry, but with a polished flair&#8230;its not ugly by any stretch.</p>
<p>There are keys on the very edge of the device,  seems like a &#8220;for over function&#8221; choice.</p>
<p>*form</p>
<p>not at all. do you want smaller keys? There won&#8217;t be any problems typing. Form over function is when people ask for less bezel on a touch screen phones, now that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll run into problems.</p>
<p>If you look at other blackberry phones like the 9780, you&#8217;ll see that the keys are practically on the edge as well and I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone have problems with that. There&#8217;s a slight curve/roundness to the side compared to this. Perhaps there might be a slight discomfort holding it? but if you&#8217;re use to the iphone 4/4s/5  and the 9900 then this is a non-event.</p>
<p>Asking for small bezels is putting one function over another. Smaller bezels allows for a smaller device with the same screen size, making it easier to hold. Larger bezels prevents accidental touches (one of the complaints of the iPad Mini). It is a trade off. I would take smaller bezels any day&#8230;</p>
<p>It reminds me of a Palm mixed with a BB keyboard. As a WebOS fan, that&#8217;s not a baf thing.</p>
<p>*bad</p>
<p>Sorry but its a horrible phone.</p>
<blockquote>it sucks to type on</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to autocorrect I have so far outtyped anyone who &#8211; until then &#8211; favoured a hardware keyboard. Anyone who is honest to oneself has to admit that after a short time of practise a software keyboard is at least as fast to type on.</p>
<p>It depends on the person. I am great at a soft keyboard with autocorrect (I am really bad at hardware keyboards too&#8230;). However, my sister hates soft keyboards. She <strong>needs</strong> tactile feel. Maybe she doesn&#8217;t want to get used to it, but a physical keyboard is better for her. It is highly subjective&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>Maybe she doesn’t want to get used to it</blockquote>
<p>This, I think, is the point. I&#8217;m not going to start to tell people what to like, I just hate to hear that hardware keyboards are better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just hate to hear that hardware keyboards are better.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they absolutely are. Software keyboards are a compromise you accept in order to get better multimedia-capabilities. You you will try to minimize this compromise by autocorrection, word predicition, swift key and so on, but it&#8217;ll never be the same. I have a QWERTY BlackBerry and I don&#8217;t use autocorrection and I don&#8217;t use word substitution. I type without any help, because it&#8217;s the greatest type experience to have everything under full control. Speed: 5-6 digits per second. Moreover it&#8217;s much more natural and more fun, it feels great. Whatever, I&#8217;m going for the alltouch BB10 phone, for better multimedia and because I think that phone minimizes the compromise to a level I can live with. But I&#8217;ll be never going to say that software keyboards are anywhere near the greatness of hardware ones.</p>
<p>Maybe I just have fat thumbs, but like I said, I am absolutely terrible on a physical keyboard. I can&#8217;t hit multiple keys with one press on a soft keyboard, it just takes the one in the middle. That makes, like I said, keyboards are highly subjective from user to user&#8230;</p>
<p>The back panel design is so bloody uninspiring and looks too cheap and plasticky &#8211; this set is suppose will be the lower/bottom middle spec!</p>
<p>The back has a soft, slip-proof, scratch-proof finish like the PlayBook and portions of the Bold 99xx has. Lenovo and other industry grade product designers use the same thing. Not everyone wants a cheap, glossy, slippery back on their phone.</p>
<p>Cheap looking back panels haven&#8217;t stopped Samsung. Cheap back is the new black.</p>
<p>Seriously? What does the word &#8220;sex&#8221; mean to you?</p>
<p>Complete sarcasm.</p>
<p>He never said &#8220;sex&#8221;. Rather he/she said &#8220;sexy&#8221; which in this age is used as a substitute for a sleek or beautiful looking in an informal way.</p>
<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>2005 called.</p>
<p>&#8230;and said: do you want your marketshare of 2005 back?</p>
<p>&#8230;and said: take me to the future, where no one wants me.</p>
<p>ouch!</p>
<p>&#8230;and said: Take me to 2015, where Marty McFly will buy me in a souvenir shop instead of a stupid sports almanac.</p>
<p>Tell them where Obama is!</p>

<p>Palm Pixi, anyone?</p>
<p>so true</p>
<p>I am surprised you didn&#8217;t compare it to the Moto Droid Pro. This looks like a blackberry. If anything, the palm pixi looks like a blackberry too, not the other way around.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right. My comparison is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Why so much top and side bezel? You&#8217;d think with a QWERTY board, you&#8217;d want to do whatever you can to maximize screen size.</p>
<p>Could be for better bezel gesture support, could be because RIM isn&#8217;t keen on minimizing the bezel size.</p>
<p>could be so you can bedazzle your bezels</p>

<p>*RIM</p>
<p>TiMM = This is My Next</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t really need explaining and then you explained it wrong. Oops.</p>
<p>No, I knew that was. He said Blackberry when RIM is the company and Blackberry is the brand.</p>
<p>From the clips I have seen of BB10, i&#8217;m intrigued. I will be in the market for a new phone next year and I have zero loyalty to any brand. I like my iphone 4 but I&#8217;m not wedded to IOS or google for that matter. I am looking forward to seeing what RIM has done.</p>
<p>i am tied to google pretty well i think. lucky for peeps like me, i can be on rims platform and still be tied to google.</p>
<p>You mean Bluestacks / app emulation or just services?</p>
<p>He means the native android app player</p>
<p>Ah yes.</p>
<p>Two words, Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Is it me or does the screen look to be about 2.5&quot;-3&quot;? I think RIM has read their market research graphs on screen sizes upside down.</p>
<p>They read their market share graphs on portrait qwerty devices. The emphasis here is on the keyboard, not the screen. Sacrifices had to be made.</p>
<p>They have another full touch at 4.2&quot;. Don&#8217;t be close minded and realize there is a market for qwerty devices out there. That&#8217;s why their CEO has been asked my press several times about this model.</p>
<p>Not everyone wants a 5&quot; behemoth. IMO, Android OEMs are doing it wrong. RIM and Apple are doing it right where they have a design that has made an impact and has evolved over time. Some other OEMs just have very generic devices with no real character.</p>
<p>With 30 million sgs3 sold and over 5 million galaxy note 2. Samsung must be doing it right. And with billions in profit for proof.</p>
<p>Not really. They copied apple, then once they got a good design(copying apple). They decided to make all there phones look the same. Example: note 2, gs3, and gs3 mini. Part of the reason they sold a lot of phones is by bashing apple, making people think there phones the next big thing. When it isn&#8217;t lol</p>
<p>If Sammy coppied Apple like you claim,  then RIMs L series phone also copied Apple iphone design  and the Nokia N9 Meego gesture OS.</p>
<p>When did I claim that Samsung copied Apple? Read what I said again.I said they haven&#8217;t offered much in terms of a distinct design. As far as Meego gestures, RIM acquired the Swedish design firm TAT who has worked with conceptual design on Meego and Android in the past. I&#8217;m sure they got a lot of influence from them on that.</p>
<p>He was referring to SDTRMG&#8217;s post claiming samsung copied apple with devices like sgs3, note 2 etc.</p>
<p>Well since blackberrys had email, apps, app grid, app launcher, themes, customization, file management etc before both android and iOS, I&#8217;d say rim isn&#8217;t copying no one, they also released the strong in 2008, it was shitty but was a touch screen device before android g1</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>How is RIM doing it right when they are losing money every quarter and currently have less than 5% market share?   Samsung seems to be doing just fine selling phones, televisions, and other appliances.</p>
<p>I should have been more specific. I was talking about product design, not sales figures. But in regards to that, RIM still has 79mil subscribers, so the chances of them selling several million new BB10 phones and gaining back market share is high.</p>
<p>I never challenged Samsung&#8217;s ability to sell. They&#8217;re doing an excellent job at that. My point was they haven&#8217;t exactly created an iconic design of their own. I had a QX410 laptop and I&#8217;ll admit it looked just like a MacBook.</p>
<p>I rather have a phone with no character then one that unnecessarily wastes space.</p>
<p>I could argue that the extra 1-2&quot; some of these newer phones are adding to the screen are unnecessary. Especially when you&#8217;re pushing the same amount of pixels as the smaller competitors and just stretching them. What&#8217;s the point?</p>
<p>What is the difference between a 24&quot; TV and a 55&quot; TV? They are both 1080p so what is the point?</p>
<p>If I had to carry a tv I&#8217;d rather the 24&quot;. Just like for a phone I&#8217;m good with 4&quot; don&#8217;t need 5&quot; or  6&quot; on a phone when I got a tablet</p>
<p>Yes, lets all take what he said and blow it out of proportion. 1-2&quot; is not nearly the same as 31&quot;. TV size directly effects how close you need to be on a much bigger scale in comparison to an inch on a phone.</p>
<p>Adios, RIM! Was nice knowin&#8217; ya!</p>
<p>Serious question here, what are the key unique selling points of BB10?</p>
<p>There are some interesting features, but a lot is borrowed from current smartphone OSes (Android, iOS, Windows Phone&#8230;). I&#8217;m not sure if there is anything big enough to differentiate itself from the pack. I think adoption will be hard to find, especially if they don&#8217;t get developers on board early and often. Windows Phone has over 150,000 apps and it&#8217;s still considered a fledgling app store.</p>
<p>apps arent an issue.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>
<p>BB has their core fanbase. THey will buy BB devices &#8211; and no one else.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt until I see a fully-baked BB10 OS and device.</p>
<p>I am concerned about running Android apps in emulation. My own experience with Android apps hasn&#8217;t been good. They are usually laggy and crash a lot (on a RAZR Maxx). I can&#8217;t imagine that things will be any better running in emulation.</p>
<p>And that fan base is shrinking.  Most corporations have or are moving beyond BB.</p>
<p>There are one or two on here who come out to defend RIM at the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>My uncle owns a contracting company and was a die hard BB guy but bought the original Galaxy Note when it came out. He said that they just weren&#8217;t making anything worth buying. I told him that BB is going to make new phones in 2013 that are supposed to be able to compete, he said he&#8217;ll check them out but is already fine now that he moved on. He said he doesn&#8217;t want to have to switch again which I don&#8217;t blame him. For many companies it is too little too late.</p>
<p>Yeah.  At work it was decided to stop buying new BB gear for the same reasons.  Whatever is there is there but it&#8217;s now all moving to Android or iPhones using stuff like Good for Enterprise to access corporate stuff..  It&#8217;s also turned out to be cheaper since the BB licenses are not cheap.</p>
<p>Same here. Although, they (meaning my company) prefer users switch to Windows Phone 8 or iOS because of issues with setting users up on Exchange servers. Apparently IT has had a ton of issues getting employees email working on all the different handsets running Android.</p>
<p>BB is no longer accepted.</p>
<p>Yeah.  There is a subtle nod toward the iPhone but they won&#8217;t block android users.  Using Good makes it pretty easy to manage really.</p>
<p>Yup mine is. I work in IT and leaving work today one of the employed rode with me down the elevator. He saw my galaxy nexus and inquired about it. Said I lobe it for what it does but every individual is different. He showed me his blackberry and said it just cannot keep up with his life now. I told him I got my Mom a galaxy 3 after her bold died she did not want a another blackberry. I mentioned he can wait in January when Rim shows the 10. He didn&#8217;t even care he said nah.</p>
<p>Many Android apps won&#8217;t run, especially games.</p>
<blockquote>Unsupported software features:<br />
Apps that utilize native code bundled into their APK file</blockquote>
<p>Plus many more: <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/apisupport/unsupportedapi_blackberry10_overview.html" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android/apisupport/unsupportedapi_blackberry10_overview.html</a></p>
<p>Apps are totally an issue. Functionality beyond email, web browsing, contacts, calendar, notes,  camera, and basic messaging is handled by apps (if you want to be technical, that stuff is handled by apps too, but they come with the device). Twitter, facebook, instagram, skype, netflix, words with friends, temple run, these are all apps. People want them. Even before Apple introduced the app store, winmo had apps, blackberries had apps, plam PDAs had apps, PCs had apps, Macs had apps. Apps have always been an issue.</p>
<p>I disagree. The biggest target for BB10 is the corporate sector and while apps are nice, they aren&#8217;t needed beyond the basics you listed. By no means am I saying that this will save to company. Especially not in the eyes of regular consumers, but BB never really went after them. They are making a ploy to those in a coroporate setting wondering if they should continue to license the BB server. Those who like their current infrastructure will eat this up till they realize it&#8217;s just like the old ones and not as good as the phones already in their pockets.</p>
<p>Last time RIM released numbers on this I think Enterprise was only 20% of their business. The rest were consumers. The cooperate sector is not the biggest target for RIM. They have to win back consumers to be successful in their current form.</p>
<p>I am not saying that apps will make or break the platform, but apps are important. RIM needs several things in order to get the apps consumers want. First, the platform and developer tools need to be able to support the things app developers want. RIM has taken care of this. Second, the market for apps needs to be profitable for developers. The number of users available and the cost to develop  or port apps is a big factor here. Third, developers need to be convinced that developing for BB10 is worth it. RIM is aware of, and working on all of these things. BB10&#8217;s core features may be enough to draw a critical mass of users without the support of major apps such as skype and netflix, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>If I understand your last sentence correctly, you are basically saying that BB10 devices are going to be just like the current BB7 devices and not as good as the competition. This is incorrect. BB10 is completely different and a better platform in many ways.</p>
<p>The corporate sector is not keen on paying additional monthly &#8220;blackberry data&#8221; charges, on top of licensing BES severs/devices and on thop of that needing to potentially run multiple BES servers for the BB10 devices.   RIM makes a good mount of money charging the Blackberry data costs, and used it to upgrade their infrastructure (RIM Back end servers) in this day and age, there is very little the offering of RIM&#8217;s data services brings to the corp as a good thing.</p>
<p>They are moving to tiered service plans.</p>
<p>But aren&#8217;t more companies adopting the &#8220;bring your own phone&#8221; policy now? I think that the enterprise market is a long shot for RIM. I rarely see anyone rocking a BB at work or when I meet with clients. It&#8217;s all IOS or Android now.</p>
<p> Also this past August my employer sent out a company wide email (a full year early mind you) saying in August 2013 they will no longer be supporting BB devices.</p>
<p>you work for yahoo? hahah</p>
<p>Nope, but Yahoo! and my employer are probably not the only companies out there who no longer see the economic benefit  paying BB to use their email/data servers.</p>
<p>Especially in this econimic climate.</p>
<p>errr&#8230;<em>economic<em>climate.</em></em></p>
<p>errr again <em><em>economic</em> climate.</em></p>
<p>Apps are actually pretty big and growing in the enterprise.  Between in-house apps and third party ones used they are growing.</p>
<p>Consumers is the reason why rim is like this. They need to win big with consumers .</p>
<p>Wrong. They copied a lot from WebOS and Meego. Not from WP7 ( tiles are just square widgets, like they have on Symbian, Android, Maemo and others OS&#8217;s) or iOS and Android. Android itself copied heavily from webOS; for instance, the card interface for multitasking. Lead interface designer  for Android was lead UI designer for webOS at Palm. The gesture area on Playbook  and BB10 devices is also copied from webOS.<br />
BB did make a very interesting mix of all these (webos, meego/Harmattan and BB7)  UI&#8217;s in BB10. Looks very interesting, a new ui paradigm for continous work flow.</p>
<p>gestures. secure. any app from the play store can be ported into the bb store.  all conversations emails etc are going to be in one spot. a simple swipe to right brings up your hub. &lt;&#8212;- i dunno about how well i care about or need this&#8230; but thorsten thought it was revolutionary.</p>
<p>check out the interview on the last vergeshow. there is a clip so you dont have to watch the whole thing. very interesting interview.</p>
<p>and if you use the main social networks&#8230; those apps are going to be deeply integrated in.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t (doesn&#8217;t) help Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Personally for me, the unique selling point of BB10 is the level of integration between the different components of the OS. I also like the way the interface prioritizes common tasks to make the most common tasks simple and quick to access. RIM calls this &#8220;peek and flow&#8221;. Things like waking up the device, going back a screen, checking notifications, switching apps, and checking messages can be directly accessed using gestures from basically anywhere in the OS. Contrast this with the what RIM calls the &#8220;in and out&#8221; home screen centric interface on iOS, Andriod, and WP8 where you go back to the home screen and launch another app to accomplish most things. I also like the blackberry hub, which is basically a fancy unified inbox that can be accessed from anywhere via a gesture.</p>
<p>For enterprise, I think blackberry balance will be a big deal. BB balance allows the device to have two modes, one for work and one for personal use. No information can pass between these two modes and the work half of the device can be wiped independently of the personal half.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand how BB10 minimizes the &#8216;in and out&#8217; behavior more than any OS which features a notification area.</p>
<p>Not all notification areas allow you to reply without leaving the current app youre in.</p>
<p>The pull down notification drawer allows you to stay in an app, but once you act on a notification, you are out. BB10 is slightly different. The app keeps running, and is simple to return to. Also the notifications area is more functional than a notification drawer (as other comments have noted). But it&#8217;s not just about the notification drawer, the in and out thing also extends to switching between apps and multitasking. Watch some of the demo videos and see how fast a fluid moving through the interface is compared to similar actions on other OSs. It&#8217;s not revolutionary, but it seems like a better way to do things.</p>
<p>I have watched a lot of videos and am interested in BB10 but I just don&#8217;t see how exactly it makes multitasking better. I have experience with &#8216;swiping into a grid of cards&#8217; multitasking implementations (I owned an N9) and while I like it, I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s functionally different from the way Android does it.</p>
<p>Well, for starters, it works well for business users because it can launch apps &#8220;safely&#8221;. It uses QNX, so it multitasks really well. It is expected to have 100,000 apps at launch; it can also run Android apps if they are approved by RIM. It looks like it has useful keyboard and camera features (suggestions on keyboard and rewind restoectivly).</p>
<p>Me personally, I am excited. I don&#8217;t understand why everyone is so cynical towards RIM; going so far as to want them to go out of business.</p>
<p>As someone who is considering buying the Z10 as my first blackberry device I think I can speak to your question.</p>
<p>There are a couple of really big features that stood out to me from watching the videos;</p>
<p>- Gesture based OS: I used an N9 for a bit and it made a fixed button OS seem so antiquated. I was hoping Nokia&#8217;s influence would lead to MS going the gesture based route in WP8 (especially considering Win 8 requires no buttons, all functions can be accessed through gestures) but it never happened.</p>
<p>- Sane sized phone: If you want a 4.3 inch or lower device that doesn&#8217;t have gimped specs Android is almost a write off. There are probably a couple of phones you could import that fit the bill (Xperia V and some Chinese phones) but for the most part you aren’t going to be able to find anything without accepting a reduction in specs. That basically leaves the iphone and the BB Z10 as some of the only options.</p>
<p>Well for one thing it won&#8217;t lag and get horrible standby battery life like android.  It will also have true multitasking.  And most importantly it will have true 3rd party browser support and thus support for text reflow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll put a Galaxy note 2 up against your BlackBerry 10 on multitasking and battery life.  Pretty sure note 2 will dominate both, but will know for sure some time next year.  Also, lag is a nonfactor on Android devices running jelly bean.</p>
<p>you definitely don&#8217;t understand the concept of true multitasking. android does not do this.</p>
<p>Sure.  Because blackberry 10 devices are the only devices that can perform this magical feat of &#8220;true multitasking&#8221;.  /s.    Ill just return to my windows PC and Android device that Multitask just fine.</p>
<p>your PC multitasks because the apps run in the &#8220;background.&#8221; actually they run because there is no background, there are running services (this is what android accomplishes) and there are open windows, of which can be both active and not active. for android, there is only running services and a single active application. android achieves the ILLUSION of multitasking by having a list of &#8220;running&#8221; apps in the app drawer attached to the new &#8220;running apps&#8221; button. however, the applications do NOT run when they are not in focus. android only allows for a single application to run at once. as soon as you switch to another application through the running application switcher, the current application is put into a new suspend state. some applications are designed as such that they will then begin to use a service to update in the background. this however is still NOT multitasking. the application is not closed, but it is not running either. it is in limbo. both webos and qnx do not do this way. these operating systems allow applications to completely run and share CPU at the same time. they do not suspend applications when they are not in focus, or in the foreground, or whatever you may decide to call it. this is what true multitasking does. you can see the effects especially easily using a very basic javascript timeout test. create an application however you want, and set a 1 minute countdown timer. install the application on webos, qnx, and android, and then open a separate app to switch to. then, open your countdown app on all three devices and quickly switch to another application. if you create the app to ring a bell at the end of the countdown, you should hear TWO bells and TWO bells only &#8212; the third bell will never ring for Android because it is not in the foreground. in fact, unless you SPECIFICALLY code it otherwise, when you switch back the android application will actually RESTART from the beginning (because it&#8217;s a web app, but this is a completely different subject matter).</p>
<p>but i doubt you&#8217;ll read my post. or even care. hey, man, enjoy your android. it&#8217;s fine with me, no need to get condescending</p>
<p>going by the scheduler they are in the background when not active or having a controlling window/terminal/whatever.  Background is an acceptable term for this.</p>
<p>You realize Android, which is based on linux, has a number or processes running all the time?</p>
<p>processes, but not 3rd party apps.</p>
<p>exactly. this is the difference. BIIIIIIIIIIG distinction.</p>
<p>I appreciate your response.   Enjoy your flavor of multitasking. Happy New Year</p>
<p>so what about the android side of rim. if they are able to emulate android apps onto their app store&#8230;. would it be safe to say that there will be an emulator type deal that i could get my hands on to convert my paid play store apps myself and sideload?</p>
<p>Yes. You can basically do this on the playbook now. Not all apps are compatible.</p>
<p>A real example is using an Android app for me on the Playbook is ES File Explorer.  It runs perfect and allows me to play video OTA from my home network.   Just one example of a very useful app that was written for Android but will run without any modification (other than a quick 30-second repackaging to .BAR file from .APK file)</p>
<p>I know many may not believe it, but there are thousands of Android apps that run on the Playbook without modification and thus will also run on BB10 without modification.  Not all Android apps, but many useful ones do work and work like they should work and there is no distinguishable difference running the app on and Android device or BB10 device.</p>
<p>I really do miss a good hardware keyboard.  I don&#8217;t use my android phone for many apps.. this might be perfect for someone who just wants to fucking type :)</p>
<p>No thanks,</p>
<p>Stop trying to make Blackberry happen. It&#8217;s NOT going to happen!</p>
<p>Hey guys, block the keyboard part or the image with your hand. Now look at the picture. Hello <em>Galaxy Nexus</em>.</p>
<p>It does kind of look like a bastardized Nexus.</p>
<p>It does, but to be fair, I was just trying to start shit. The Blackberry 9900 had a pretty similar shape and was released several month prior to the GNex even being announced.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img src="http://awesomeer.com/blackberry.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not to mention the Bold 9000 that came out in 2008.</p>
<p>Ohhhh Samsung.. <em>you so cray-cray</em>.</p>
<p>Is it just me or is the phone on the left much prettier?</p>
<p>No, not just you. The Bold 9900 was and is a beautiful piece of hardware &#8212; the best Blackberry by far &#8212; but that operating system.. that awful, <em>awful </em>operating system..</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I don&#8217;t think OS 7.1 is awful at all.  I&#8217;m hopeful to see what BB10 brings, as it will be my next smartphone, but my current 9930 works quite well for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful&#8221; might not be the best word, as it was once great, but archaic or outdated might be better.  If it works for you, that&#8217;s great, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. Have you ever had a newer Android, iPhone, or Windows Phone 7+ phone for any period of time? I don&#8217;t mean playing with one at a store or with one of your friends&#8217;, I mean actual used as your own device. I&#8217;m assuming probably not, no offense, but for most it&#8217;s hard to go back to something with so many technical limitations. Sure, getting used to a completely different mobile operating system may be a bit arduous initially after spending years with Blackberry, but for most it&#8217;s worth it.</p>
<p>The problem is that underneath all those new coats of paint OS 7 is still built off of the same exact core as the original Blackberry from 13 years ago. On the one hand, that gives you the benefit of years of legacy support. On the other, certain technical limitations it brings with it are, while unavoidable, really just inexcusable in this day. For instance, needing to reboot your entire phone whenever you install or update an application or game.</p>
<p>I will say that BB10 looks very impressive, though I&#8217;m not going to get my hopes up. Blackberry Tablet OS (on the PlayBook), which BB10 is based on, was and is fantastic from a performance and usability perspective. It&#8217;s just the lack of a stable ecosystem and RIM questionable longevity that have me on the fence.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of BlackBerry products, but I&#8217;m with you 100% on this. I wish everyone would put their products down this way and not bash it based on thin air.</p>
<p>I do have to say, while your concerns for the PlayBook launch are totally valid, also know that it was used as stepping stones towards BB10. While the PlayBook Tablet OS is plagued with a UI comprised of Adobe AIR (resource hog), BB10 will consist mostly of native code that is much more fluid and light.</p>
<p>I think you should definitely give it a shot. I have their developer phone with BB10 on it and it runs very smooth. This is coming from a product that was given to me last May, isn&#8217;t final hardware, and is running much older software than what will launch.</p>
<p>Unless someone brings out an Android device that has a physical keyboard in a BlackBerry form factor, then no, I have no desire for one (no interest in WP and we know there will never be a QWERTY iPhone).  First and foremost for me is a physical keyboard.  Yes I know there have been Android devices in that form factor, but basically they were crap.  Typing on a touchscreen doesn&#8217;t do it for me at all (and this includes my PlayBook).</p>
<p>As for BB OS 7, I see something that works well with the hardware it&#8217;s on.  I don&#8217;t see it being outdated or having technical limitations (rebooting the phone after a update or deletion is annoying but honestly manageable).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to learn a new mobile OS.  I&#8217;m just choosing to do it with BB 10 since they give me a hardware device I want and hoping that some of the concepts that have been in BB phones make it over.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t awful.  Yes it is is not glitzy and you can&#8217;t play with it, and there aren&#8217;t as many apps, but it is a purpose built communication device and performs those functions very well.  I have an Android for play; my Blackberry is a work phone and the 9900 (and OS 7) is an excellent work phone.  If tablets had come along a few years earlier and people used them for play, the Blackberry phone would still be on top and there would be a greater appreciation for the OS.</p>
<p>How do you say, &#8220;Give it up&#8221; in French?</p>
<p>Laisse tomber ?</p>
<p>&#8220;Abandonnez&#8221;, but RIM aren&#8217;t French Canadians, just Canadians.</p>
<p>Yeah but the joke wouldn&#8217;t work then.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel better, the joke doesn&#8217;t work anyway.</p>
<p>And what do the speak in Canada French and English. So its not like he&#8217;s wrong or something.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s as wrong as saying the Battle of Waterloo took place close to RIM&#8217;s headquarters. The Constitution states that both English and French are the official languages in Canada. Most Canadians don&#8217;t speak both languages, and certainly the overwhelming majority of the people in Waterloo speak English.</p>
<p>Foutez le camp</p>
<p>Because all the businesses that switched their employees to iPhones are going to switch back.</p>
<p>^ This. I think this is what most people are failing to realize. No one is going to switch back over, and companies that were on the fence&#8230; I seriously doubt BB10 has anything to offer to keep them from switching.</p>
<p>Like ICE&#8230;oh wait.</p>
<p>BlackBerry Balance and Mobile Fusion will appeal plenty to enterprises along with BlackBerry&#8217;s enterprise experience and security.</p>
<p>Either way,  neither of us can see the future so we shall see.</p>
<p>Hold off and trial does not mean they will not switch. Unless BB can really offer something that ICE cannot get elsewhere, they are going to bail. ICE had the option to wait the whole time but chose to make preps to switch. That to me sounds like they really don&#8217;t want to wait, but more like RIM talked them into it.</p>
<p>They do have something to offer that other os&#8217;s don&#8217;t, a military approved fips certification, the only mobile OS to receive it.</p>
<p>Motorola and Samsung Android phones received the same fips certification.</p>
<p>Android and iOS did not receive the same fips certification, they have been trying for years and can accomplish it.</p>
<p>ICE is moving forward with iphone 5.  RIM offerd a free trial so ICE could evaluate the new BB 10 phones.</p>
<p>They switched once, they might switch again. Their reasons for switching are more important than the fact that they switched. Reports of companies leaving blackberry en mass are slightly exaggerated. Their subscriber numbers are not in free fall as some would lead you to believe or what your gut tells you (they lost 1 million last quarter, first net loss ever). I am not saying RIM is out of the woods, but they are far from dead.</p>
<p>They switched because Blackberry has been stagnant as an OS for the past several years.     I doubt iOS and Android  will stop innovating and allow BB10 to catch up.  I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll fail, but I think best case is they keep 5% market share and battle WP for #3.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s we&#8217;re your wrong since bb10 already has and will be releases with more feature then iOS, the only thing better about iOS is the App Store. And I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user switching to bb10</p>
<p>That&#8217;s we&#8217;re your wrong since bb10 already has more feature then iOS, the only thing better about iOS is the App Store. And I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user switching to bb10</p>
<p>Will android ever receive the do not lag feature?</p>
<p>Blackberry phones have always lagged.   That&#8217;s one of the reasons people switched to ios and android.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lie lol</p>
<p>iOS stopped innovating years ago. They are riding on the coattails of developers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using the iPhone 5 since launch in between last month I tried the Note 2. Here are just some reasons why I&#8217;m going back to BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Since 2007 iOS hasn&#8217;t changed much. I hate the locked down eco system everything has to go through iTunes. You can&#8217;t even transfer picture using Bluetooth. Even my 2002 Nokia was able to do that. Creating a beautiful industrial design phone that is prone scratches sucks. No point making a very thing phone that can&#8217;t be used without a case&#8230; Battery life that doesn&#8217;t last 5 hours of use. I know all phones have sucky battery life but the iPhone is the worst. Plus the battery cannot be swapped&#8230; But I&#8217;m getting used to the phone. iOS 6 is more refined than any other OS &#8220;currently&#8221; available including Windows phone 8 and Android. UI is getting boring with the static icons but it works for the most part. I hate the multi-tasking and double clicking and triple clicking the home button. Not intuitive at all. All in all as a phone I seem to prefer iPhone over Android. I wouldn&#8217;t have said that a year ago. Mostly because of the screen size, build quailty and the software keyboard is better on the iPhone with BlackBerry like feature especially word shortcuts which I use often. Also Android is fragmented, heats up, force closes too often. My iPhone 5&#8217;s days are numbered.</p>
<p>You have a some things incorrect here.  You can transfer files using bluetooth 4.0 with iOS now.  Also you don&#8217;t need iTunes anymore for anything really.  That went away with iOS 5.<br />
There are quite a few apps which handle all sorts of file transfer functions as well.</p>
<p>If you are having that level of battery issues something else is going on.  What are you running?  Anything like Skype which is known to drain the battery.</p>
<p>I switched from my Note 2 back to my iPhone 5 i wasn&#8217;t able to send pictures from my SD card using the Note 2 to my iPhone 5. I even took the SD card insereted into my old Bold 9900 still didn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s another plus with BlackBerry and Android swapable SD cards.</p>
<p>Try using drop box/Drive and most of those problems go away.  I am not saying there is no need for transferring over bluetooth, but it s a non issue considering wifi direct solutions (on the Note 2 this was something Samsung paid a lot of attention to)</p>
<p>I have 4 email accounts setup. I don&#8217;t use Skype so its not Skype. This is my second iPhone 5. First one I had screen issues with unresponsive screen. Took it to the Apple store 3 times finally on the 3rd try time they exchanged it for me.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t going to get anywhere with this!</p>
<p>well i am not a fan of hardware keyboard anymore &#8230;. but i like the look of this &#8230; <br />
but the other one, the full-touch one, looks really cool &#8230; i wish them well &#8230; it&#8217;s better for all of us in the end &#8230; i don&#8217;t want samsung, google and apple to be my only choices &#8230;</p>
<p>First I&#8217;m gonna say I believe this is a reference model as there is a lot of confusion as to wether this is Dev alpha C or an actual final end user unit.<br />
Based on what I am seeing there is room for improvement. The screen size is my biggest worry, RIM must be tearing their hair out to find an optimum solution for this problem. I believe the screen should be virtually edge to edge just like the new straight keyboard and with the extra screen hight available from the removal of the trackpad and buttons, this should reduce the 9900s small screen shortcoming. Hopefully these pictures have a fake screen border to fool us.</p>
<p>Another wish i have is that RIM have implemented some sort of  &#8220;TOUCH SWIPE GESTURES&#8221; within the metallic strips running through the keyboard to simulate the beautiful swipe gestures seen on the full touch screen BB10 phones and many video demos of the os.</p>
<p>Santa my late Xmas pressie has still not arrived, am impatiently waiting.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just a month away from a launch that was originally supposed to be two+ months ago, with the reason for the delay being software maturity.  In all likelihood the hardware has been final for several months now, so I see no reason why RIM would have pre-production devices floating around at this stage.</p>
<p>RIM have already announced a few weeks ago that Dev alpha C (keyboard) units were being sent out to developers. It seems to make more sense that there would be leaks of the alpha units before the end user units. I agree with your point that the final hardware has been in RIMs hand for months by now.</p>
<p>This is a dec alpha c devices, the devices rim put in developers hands to test the OS/games/apps. No company would be dumb enough to put the final product in people&#8217;s hands before release, it&#8217;s common sense.</p>
<p>I think BlackBerry may have a winner here. Microsoft should be very worried right about now as their WP OS market share will continue to plunge back down to 1% when this takes off.</p>
<p>+100000</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t see how this can compete with my Galaxy note 2.  I can multitask with split screen or pop up windows. Take notes via S pen with handwriting to text recognition and type extremely fast with swiftkey flow keyboard.   The choices are abundant on the note 2.</p>
<p>Size is all about personal preference, but for someone like me, everything you list above is as irrelevant as the stuff I&#8217;m able to do on my laptop. I don&#8217;t consider the Note 2 a phone, I consider it a tablet and as such don&#8217;t care what it can do vs what a phone can do. With that said, I&#8217;ve used those pop-up apps on my brothers galaxy tab and they made the whole OS so sluggish and laggy that it seemed easier to just launch the app.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about size .   The same multitasking features have been added to the Galaxy S 3 which is the best selling phone on the market.   Your point is invalid.</p>
<p>I love that you try and use logical terms like &#8220;invalid&#8221; while you&#8217;re entire argument is an appeal to authority, one of the most basic logical fallacies.</p>
<p>My argument is that I don&#8217;t like big phones. I can&#8217;t fathom any way for you to disprove what I do or do not like. Saying the GS3&#8217;s minority market position is slightly higher than the iPhone&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t make your point. It actually disproves your point because it shows there are still many people who don&#8217;t want those phones. A lot of people buy GS3&#8217;s; several times more people don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Oh you can multiscreen apps?  Too bad that makes the device slow down to a crawl and lag as much as android 1.5.</p>
<p>Wrong again sir.  No lag on the Galaxy note 2 and all of its features.</p>
<p>Seen it and all other bb10 devices&#8230;all were on public demo like 2 weeks ago, local newspaper even posted images of some devices (rims has a lab here). Everyone who wanted to got to hold the devices, play with them and test whatever. I don&#8217;t like BB myself but people are going to be surprised by what they have in store come release day !</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get the  need for a physical keyboard. It seems like it would be a detriment over a positive, since with an on-screen keyboard it can be hidden when you don&#8217;t need it to use the maximum amount of screen space.</p>
<p>Why is a physical keyboard so popular among Blackberry users? Just a question, I&#8217;ve never used one.</p>
<p>Because some people get more work done with a real keyboard, you ever try typing a whole document on a touch screen keyboard, or the girl in the uk who wrote a book on her blackberry and got it published. Not everyone wants a touch screen and that is who rim is aiming for there current and new customers looking for a hardware keyboard.</p>
<p>Yea and who are theses customers exactly. Sales wise and market share seems to show. People really don&#8217;t care that much about physical keyboard. To many people that&#8217;s  a step backwards, old technology.</p>
<p>Stop talking for the entire human race. Some of us like having a keyboard. Get over it.</p>
<p>See that&#8217;s where your wrong, blackberrys still sold millions of phones ever quarter witch wouldn&#8217;t have sold of &#8220;no one wanted a keyboard&#8221;, and that&#8217;s almost 2 year old hardware. With the new OS being up to par with iOS and android people won&#8217;t hesitate to upgrade or switch to a blackberry device. And since there releasing a full touch and keyboard version there catering to both markets. There&#8217;s a reason laptops/computers still have keyboards and why people buy then for tablets. Because you can get more done on a hardware keyboard then a touch screen.</p>
<p>That makes sense, thanks for the explanation &#8211; though I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine typing up a whole document on a phone &#8211; holy carpal tunnel!  ;)</p>
<p>I have had both and currently have both, and my typing is much more accurate and fast on a physical pkeyboard.  Blackberry also allows shortcut keys (to programs, callers, functions ) from the physical keyboard.  FInally, most of my large scren phone time is with the keyboard up&#8230; meaning that I don&#8217;t lose alot of screen real estate to a physical keyboard.  On whole&gt;&gt;&gt; and yes I really gave a screen keyboard the boy scout try for several years&#8230;the hardware keyboard suits me, and alot of other people, best.</p>
<p>Just switch to Android and make Android phones. A new OS will never work</p>
<p>That&#8217;s stupid, so what the only I&#8217;d are android and iOS, not everyone wants/likes those phones.</p>
<p>Some people want phones that don&#8217;t lag and drain 30% of your battery overnight, and rarely receive updates.</p>
<p>Nobody is going to switch back from anything, i think a lot of companies are going the BYOD route, it is up to each user which device they want and iPhone dominates the selection.  I don&#8217;t think the mass market will go blackberry and if they are thinking companies are still stuck in 2005 and going BB, they are more delusional than I thought.</p>
<p>After using multiple BBs for work, I would never want to use one as an everyday device.</p>
<p>See your comparing bb10 with your banks experience, witch is where your wrong since this is a whole new OS, an android/iOS like OS. Companies have already began switching back to blackberry, Boyd is cool until you start running into security issues among many other, leaked documents etc. that is where blackberry comes in, being the most secure OS is what will drive the corporate customers back.</p>
<p>And your statement is invalid since I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user switching to bb10.</p>
<p>To me it looks like that will be hard to hold and type on, the keyboard area doesn&#8217;t look very tall at all, as opposed to say a 9900 where the keyboard is half the height of the phone..</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the screen is bigger then on the 9900. The x10 has a 3.2 inch screen compared to the 2.1 inch on the 9900</p>
<p>I understand your concern. But the keyboard on the 99xx doesn&#8217;t take up half the height of the phone. Remove the trackpad and 4 surrounding keys from it, and you essentially have this new X10.</p>
<p>The keyboard being totally straight across (no &#8220;smile&#8221; layout) is a much bigger concern for me.  The last phone I owned with that setup was the Nokia e71, and it made typing slower.  My C3, for instance, had a superior keyboard with lower-quality keys than the e71 purely because of the curved layout.</p>
<p>Agree.  I have a 9900 and the curved keyboard suits thumb position.  I think the straight keyboard is a miss.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready for this to be in my hands.  This is my next!</p>
<p>/totally serious</p>
<p>Emotionally I want this BB10 to work out and be successful.. and I think that desire is clouding my ability to think logically about RIMM stock. I want it to work, but I don&#8217;t see how it will. I want an alternative that is not android (poor user experience), not apple (everyone has that phone) and not MS (haven&#8217;t really given it a shot yet).</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve read here on the Verge and other sites, BB10 has some interesting attributes. But I&#8217;m still not sure what exactly the compelling reason would be for IOS and Android users to ditch their phones in favor of BB.</p>
<p>I guess if you&#8217;re one of the few people still rocking a BB you&#8217;ll probably make the jump. Otherwise it will be a fight for 3rd place with Microsoft. A company who seems pretty determined to ensure Windows 8 phones are a success.</p>
<p>I think RIM just needs to stop the bleeding. They do still have a huge customer base especially in Africa, parts of Asia and the Carribean. RIM needs those folks to re-up and is at all possible get the rest of their corporate base to stay the course.</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 5 and will switch to a bb10 device. Bb10 will be released will more features then iOS and be on par with android.</p>
<p>Wp8 is never gonna pick up, Microsoft has been making Mobile phones for longer then 10 years and have never done it right. RIM has before and there&#8217;s nothing stopping them from doing it again.</p>
<p>Bb10 will be the most secure mobile OS/run a good amount of android apps vs android, no security at all really</p>
<p>Bb10 will have more features and NFC, things ios devices don&#8217;t have and won&#8217;t do vs iPhone 5 witch is beautiful but iOS 6 is boring and hasn&#8217;t had anything really interesting since Siri.</p>
<p>Rim will never be the top smartphone vender again, but they will be 3rd, and if iOS doesn&#8217;t step it up soon, could be 2nd in time.</p>
<p>Are you kidding?  How about bb OS 10 won&#8217;t lag and drain your battery like a sieve?  And unlike iOS and wp8 it will allow for 3rd party browsers (which means text freaking reflow)</p>
<p>Even if the phone was interesting, they have to convince customers to switch back to a dying platform with few apps, unknown reliability of the new OS and hardware, and an uncertain future. If this was $100 off-contract I might consider it to play with, but I would never again sign a 2 year contract on a BB product.</p>
<p>The last time RIM tried something revolutionary they came out with the Storm &#8211; and I was dumb enough to buy one. Never again.</p>
<p>touchscreen + blackberry = bad decision</p>
<p>i wouldnt want a new blackberry unless have the best physical keyboard</p>
<p>They will have over 100,000 apps at release, and will be able to run some android apps. Bb10 is being used by developers around the world right now, so the is is being tested and used. They so have to convince people to make the switch but not all I&#8217;m leaving my iPhone 5 for a bb10 phone. Bb10 runs on QNX, witch is a multitasking monster, so there won&#8217;t be the amount of lag and glitches you see on android it will be more polished like iOS. The storm running bbos can&#8217;t even be compared to the z10 or x10 running bb10. That&#8217;s like comparing a pinto to a BMW</p>
<p>Nobody needs you to switch, there will be plenty of new customers who havent adopted smartphones yet.</p>
<p>That alt key is really pissing me off</p>
<p>The bulk of BB&#8217;s remaining user base are users that are part of corporations that are stuck in the past.  My company, for example, couldn&#8217;t spell IT if their cash flow depended on it, so we wont be changing until 12 months after BB officially files chapter 7 and no more handsets are available.</p>
<p>Clearly, I can&#8217;t wait for that day to come.</p>
<p>70% stock price drop over 1 year&#8230;.<br />
<a href="http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-56669-RIM-prospects-dire-after-new-device-launch-delays" target="_blank">http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-56669-RIM-prospects-dire-after-new-device-launch-delays</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lie. Only 20% of there 79 million users are corporate.</p>
<p>Fuck the haters, this phone is nice and will have a large worldwide customer base. I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user and will be switching to a full touch bb10 device.</p>
<p>Do you notice you are the only poster saying you are switching from iphone 5 to a BlackBerry?  This is telling.  You talk more about BB 10 than the phone you are currently using.</p>
<p>Ya I do, because bb10 will be better then the iPhone 5 witch I own and bought the day it was released. I may be the only one in this comments threads, but we live in a big works my friend</p>
<p>Knowledge never hurt no one.</p>
<p>I have an iPhone 4s and will be switching to BB10 when it comes out. I&#8217;m looking forward to the new platform with true multi tasking and the really neat UI features. no one can do kb like BB. Even their new vkb is head and shoulders above competition.</p>
<p>+10</p>
<p>Reading the comments on this article makes me really sad. I&#8217;m a Android/iOS developer and in 6 months I&#8217;ve focused completely into BlackBerry development (I bought a Bold 9900, a PlayBook, and got a Dev Alpha). I&#8217;ve already released one app and it&#8217;s selling ok. I really love BB10 and PlayBook OS because of the way they handle the opened applications and do real multitasking. I hope at this time next year I&#8217;ll be able to say I haven&#8217;t wasted 6 months of my life.</p>
<p>As a consumer who buys from developers, I can tell you your not wasting your time. I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user switching bb10, and I&#8217;m sure I ain&#8217;t the only one.</p>
<p>Another thing to take into consideration is the fact that bbos was the 2nd most profitable mobile OS for developers behind iOS beating out android. That alone shows blackberrys users are willing to spend for games, apps etc.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;ve only focused on one OS, resources like time I guess are a deciding factor, but I wish you good luck with that. I wish you would expand your comment about why you like developing for BB10.</p>
<p>The comments are trivial, don&#8217;t let that trouble you. You have 150 comments+ on New Year&#8217;s eve&#8230; obviously there&#8217;s lots of anxiety and stress associated with the upcoming events, maybe a feeling of inadequacy as the theme of &#8220;performing&#8221; and being punished for failing is omnipresent. It&#8217;s not about tech.</p>
<p>A Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Dude hang in there. There are a ton of users that are sick and tired of the iOS that is so 2007 , and the unreliable and fragmented android. Funny how ppl are hating on the bb10 and being dismissive without having seen its full functionality.</p>
<p>+10</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad RIM is still focused on the qwerty model. They&#8217;re staying true to their roots. I&#8217;m going to have a very hard time deciding between the Z10 and this X10.</p>
<p>They just don&#8217;t learn.</p>
<p>I miss hardware keyboard like I miss writing the Dead Sea scrolls on papyrus paper</p>
<p>This new Blackberry only strikes as pleasing the fanbase, not much of anything or anyone else.</p>
<p>The problem I see right off the bat is the fact that a company that has traditionally built phones for the enterprise thinks it can take these phones and market them to consumers, to compete against Windows Phone, ios, and android. They will fail there, as Windows Phone 7 has shown, you can have a stellar handset, but if the multimedia content isn&#8217;t there, it won&#8217;t be picked up that quickly. Windows Phone 8 has a better start than 7.</p>
<p>Is it me because literally every year for a good few years, every market prediction has RIM going bankrupt? Yet they&#8217;re not gone&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, those predictions are common. But those same &#8220;analysts&#8221; don&#8217;t realize the positives in the company. Last quarter they earned more cash. They&#8217;re actually holding up better than Windows Phone (who just released their new OS) with year old phones on the oldest mobile OS in the market. They can only do better with BB10.</p>
<p>You bring up a good point that they need some distinct features to pull users away from Android/iOS though. But even if they only please a fraction of their 79mil subscribers, they will profit.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen older phones with better user interfaces.   just saying</p>
<p>Does bb10 still rely on BES like the playbook did?  If it does then it is dead in the water for most corporations IMO. When we were supporting BBs at a company I previously worked at about 30-40% of our IT licensing budget went to BES licenses since RIM hides so many useful management tools in it as opposed to them being accessible through ActiveSync.  The day we ditched BB support in favor of Good and a BYOD policy was amazing and it allowed us to expand IT a ton with some new VMware ESX servers.  We were paying as much for just phone management as we were for a huge enterprise program piece of software and to me that is telling.</p>
<p>Also BES is one of the worst pieces of software I have ever encountered and I feel bad for anyone who still has to support it.</p>
<p>Security was a big deal 3-4 years ago and it was worth dropping the extra dough on BB over windows mobile but now that the iPhone 4S and 5 have hardware encryption it&#8217;s not worth worrying about the handset end of the security spectrum, you are infinitely better off hardening your servers at that point.  Now maybe BB can usurp android&#8217;s place in the enterprise since management for those is still iffy(especially with the easyness with which one can gain root and override ActiveSync rules) and we have had serious issues with people doing things on their phone to get around IT policy because they are paranoid and think anyone in IT gives a shit where their phone is or what apps they have installed.</p>
<p>Also we have a few company made apps for iOS and afik RIM will have no method for internally managing applications through an enterprise source instead of their store.</p>
<p>RIM has a huge uphill battle and if they want the enterprise back they need to decide ahead of time that if they charge a premium for you choosing to use them( at the company level) they will lose the battle.  I can guarantee that my company was not the only one to ditch BES and be happy we weren&#8217;t paying for licenses for that in addition to dropping the stupidly expensive BB data charge that all carriers add.  There is no way any company is going to put in BES for 1-50% of its users so it better work amazingly with the same tools we use to manage iPhones and Android.</p>
<p>That is a lot more than I thought I wrote&#8230;</p>
<p>Sounds like a patchwork solution that is unreliable and unsecure. But then again Anyone with a modicum of exposure to Good could tell you the same.</p>
<p>BB10 supports Active Sync:<br />

<blockquote>Also we have a few company made apps for iOS and afik RIM will have no method for internally managing applications through an enterprise source instead of their store.</blockquote>
<p>BB10 supports installing apps from an enterprise source. BB10 also supports complete separation of business and private data including apps. RIMs service can also manage iOS and Android devices:<br />

<p>I know for future devices the now have &#8220;Mobile Fusion&#8221; witch can now manage there phones along with android/iOS/wp8 devices, allowing them to take hold of the BYOD thing.</p>
<p>Good is a joke against BB10 + BES 10 + Mobile Fusion + BB Balance</p>
<p>I know we are all taught to not judge a book by it&#8217;s cover but this looks like terrible cover art on a nice bounding.</p>
<p>Looks great.  If only they had released this in 2010 instead of 2013.</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<p>Nice phone and powerful os. Looks like rim has finally got their shyte together.</p>
<p>Ill be switching to bb10 from iPhone 4s when the new bb comes out.</p>
<p>+10</p>
<p>Sure, RIM hardware in the past aren&#8217;t bad, but that OS is just frickin&#8217; frustrating. Problem is, I live in SE Asia, where RIM is still dominant, and everybody is using BBM. So I have no choice but to go with RIM to stay connected to my friends and colleagues. If the BB10 proved to be not as frustrating as the old OSes, I will be happy to buy this as my next phone. Alongside android of course, probably Nexus 4 or Note 2.</p>
<p>Bb10 will be nothing like bbos7. It will be more stable then android and as reliable as iOS. Basically the best of both worlds.</p>

My thoughts on Blackberry 10</p>
<p>To all the &#8220;nay&#8221; sayers&#8230;it is about the new SOFTWARE BB OS 10 and giving Blackberry people who want a BOLD  mechanical QWERTY experience just that.  Otherwise, the all touch BB10 phone is functional  to others who want sexy without a mechanical QWERTY, with good form and the same ground-breaking mobile OS, BB10.  &#8220;Sexy&#8221; is subjective and the mechanical QWERTY model BB OS 10, X10 is for the loyal Blackberry fans who want QWERTY without an all touch phone.  The OS offers  tightly integrated social media, the most intelligent keyboard on the all touch, Z10 model, the fastest browser on any platform, &#8220;peek&#8221;, &#8220;flow&#8221;, and the &#8220;hub&#8221; with gestures to replace all buttons seen on older IOS and Android software platforms.</p>
<p>Anything will look better with out that repeating brick background, who decided  that should be used during a demo video?</p>
<p>Holy mother of bezel. 8-O</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a holy mother of bezel?! The more you know&#8230;.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s required for their swipe gestures originating off screen.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/27503833.jpg" /></p>
<p>I laughed out loud so hard when i saw this</p>
<p>My current HTC Titan is very bezel-less and I often am accidentally touching the screen with my hand causing my keyboard to minimize! Gah!</p>
<p>I think the design looks pretty good. Great professional look.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/images/1313574161997.jpg" /></p>
<p>It looks good 2.5 years to late possibly, but software is key.</p>
<p>2.5 years late to what? It&#8217;s not like people have stopped buying smartphones?!</p>
<p>You know, you could have taken that to be correct;</p>
<p>2.5 years to late. Late meaning near past.</p>
<p> N-series  is beautiful .. <br />
I always liked the design of 9900  .. <br />
Blackberry 10 is promising, but the current version on my Dev Alpha device is still much behind Android and iOS ..</p>
<p>The homescreen of the full-touch BB10 phone looks like my Galaxy Nexus&#8217; Contacts app.</p>
<p>The QWERTY looks really nice.</p>
<p>I kind of agree. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the BB design in terms of visual appeal and quality. My complaints have always been with the OS and the requirement to use their back end as the conduit to the Internet in general.  With BB 10 this potentially solves one of the two issues for me.</p>
<p>I completely agree.</p>
<p>They are actually good looking phone! But then again, these are press shots&#8230;..</p>
<p>If you look at the one closely you&#8217;ll see something different in the reflection&#8230;</p>
<p>If the the qwerty has a responsive screen and if bb10 piulls it off it is possible</p>
<p>Honestly, I think that image QWERTY device is just a rehash of the 9900. With the unlock and notification gestures starting below the screen, I just can&#8217;t see that being a real device.</p>
<p>The 9900 keyboard is fantastic &#8211; I&#8217;ve owned a lot of QWERTY phones and none of them come close. If they can incorporate that same keyboard into a more modern phone&#8230;.do it.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that this thing has no gesture area. I&#8217;m doubting that we&#8217;re seeing an actual product.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you understand how they implemented gestures. webOS has the gesture area. This just uses edge detection where if your swipe originated from the very furthest pixel on the edge it acts as a gesture.</p>
<p>Kind of correct here.</p>
<p>The gesture reading starts a few pixels off screen.  On my PlayBook, I can start a gesture without actually touching the visual part of the screen, but it only goes in about a mm.  The bezel does not need to be there at all, except for the fact that you want a little space for the finger to get to the height of the screen if there is a case on the side of the phone.</p>
<p>The 9900 is already a great device, so what&#8217;s wrong with the &#8220;rehearse&#8221;?</p>
<p>You suspect that the new blackberry OS is vapourware? Or that as the leak looks so similar to the 9900 that it can&#8217;t possibly work? Or that some of the gestures that were previously seen on the playbook don&#8217;t function? I&#8217;m fairly confused at your whole statement.</p>
<p>Would have liked a more interesting design for the L-Series but its whatever the N-Series however is just perfect keeping the same form factor of the 9900 is a good move, if it ain&#8217;t broke don&#8217;t fix it.</p>
<p>Awesome! Will be my 2nd option. Android is 1st.</p>
<p>I hated the old RIM, but I would buy the n-series of blackberry 10 if it looked like that. Full qwerty keyboard and an os similar to WebOS, that is what I am talking about.</p>
<p>N Series is for their existing keyboard loving customers.. A lot of people prefer BB for the keyboard</p>
<p>The qwerty one actually looks really good.</p>
<p>RIM continues its bizarre devotion to the currency key (the software keyboard has dedicated period and comma keys, thankfully).</p>
<p>BB10 actually looks interesting to me, particularly the gestures. I wish there was a portrait slider in the mix (more like the Pre 3 than the Torch 98xx), but I&#8217;m very interested in checking out the L-Series.</p>
<p>I actually use the $ key a lot on my 9930.  The period is barely needed since double spacing adds a period anyways.  Also, a space in a url turns into a period as well as in an email , the first space becomes @ and the second space becomes a period.</p>
<p>Do you use dollar signs more than periods? I much rather two presses be required for a dollar sign then a period. I don&#8217;t know exact punctuation usage statistics, but periods are used much more often than dollar signs. If you look at the comments on this page, the dollar sign is used only four times. The period is used 167 times (101 times without a space after it), and the question mark is used 26 times (I was too lazy to figure out commas and apostrophes, because I would have to remove all &#8220;&#8217;s reply&#8221; and &#8220;posted on.&#8221; However, both are used more often than dollar signs).</p>
<p>All of RIM&#8217;s software keyboards have dedicated period keys, as do the software keyboards for Android, iOS (iPad), Windows Phone, webOS, Symbian/Belle, and MeeGo. Every QWERTY computer keyboard I&#8217;ve ever seen has a dedicated (one press) period key, as do the hardware keyboards from HP/Palm/Handspring (Pres, Pixis, Veer, Centro, Treos), Motorola (Droid 1-4/Pro and Qs), etc.</p>
<p>If a dedicated dollar sign is so useful, why doesn&#8217;t anyone else do it?</p>
<p>I should ask RIM about the currency key.</p>
<p>$$$ because they&#8217;re for professionals AND drug dealers :P</p>
<p>i was at a marines expo the last three days, and after bugging the blackberry rep, he let me see the l series. wouldnt let me touch, but up close it looks like good design. i espically like the seperation between work and personal</p>
<p>and yes the case behind it was HUGE!</p>
<p>Qwertied phone looks fine. But, please, why remove IR joystick and call buttons? They are quite handy. Especially when you are in gloves.</p>
<p>You probably could just press the enter button instead.</p>
<p>The enter button is not a joystick type button.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t talking about the joystick was referring to the call buttons.</p>
<p>He was referring to all of them and you didn&#8217;t specify.</p>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>The way BB10 works, the buttons just aren&#8217;t needed.  A swipe from the top of the screen is the same as the &#8220;meun&#8221; key, a swipe from the bottom of the phone is the same as the &#8220;End&#8221; key, and there is a dedicated &#8220;talk&#8221; key that is always a bottom swipe away, located on the home screen.</p>
<p>The trackpad is the only thing that can&#8217;t be replaced, but it just wouldn&#8217;t work with this OS except for selecting and highlighting text, which can be done with your fingers like it can on any other OS.</p>
<p>Mmm, I&#8217;m sure watching a wide-screen video on a square screen is gonna be A-MAZING!</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not a toy phone genius, it&#8217;s a working phone, for people who work.</p>
<p>Tell that to anyone <em>not</em> living in India.</p>
<p>&#8230;who still want a phone for work? What?</p>
<p>the assumption being that people in india don&#8217;t engage in media consumption activities so &#8230;&#8230;. in fact forget it, i&#8217;m not even going to attempt to decipher that thinly veiled xenophobic bs&#8230;</p>
<p>Easy dude. All I was saying is that it seems everyone but India has moved on.</p>
<p>iPhone, Android, WP.. vast majority of these phones are hooked up to work accounts. Just because it isn&#8217;t a boring ass 9900bold fully dependent on shitty BB services like BES or BESXpress doesn&#8217;t make it a toy.</p>
<p>Mmm, I&#8217;m sure people watch videos on their BlackBerry too.</p>
<p>*yawn</p>
<p>it&#8217;s a phone, not a toy.</p>
<p>I guess that N-series is a toy then, right?</p>
<p>L-Series*</p>
<p>They&#8217;re still enterprise phones. Video playback on the QWERTY Isn&#8217;t important. Exchange email is. Document editing is.</p>
<p>Yet it still has the ability to do so&#8230; It&#8217;s no more an enterprise phone than an iPhone, GNex, or Lumia900.</p>
<p>And if you knew what a pain in the ass it is to get Exchange email on them, you might reconsider the &#8220;enterprise&#8221; moniker.</p>
<p>Setting up exchange email on my old 9000 was completely painless if that&#8217;s what you meant. I&#8217;ve never had or heard of a more responsive email service on any other brand of mobile device.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to be snide, but I would love to hear how you accomplished that painlessly. If it was going through BB web services, that&#8217;s simply unacceptable for &#8216;enterprise&#8217;, where the employee count can be rather large.</p>
<p>People that want to watch movies on their phone aren&#8217;t going to be getting the N-Series.  That is what the L-Series is for.  However, N-Series owners will still be able to watch videos is needed, just like I do currently on my 9930.  It&#8217;s not ideal, but it is definitely big enough to get the job done.  Also, the N-Series has a bigger screen than the 9930.</p>
<p>The 9930 has a 2.8&quot; screen, the N will probably have a screen that is somewhere between 3-3.5&quot;</p>
<p>The iPhone 4/4S both have a 3.5&quot; screen and people love to watch videos on them</p>
<p>I am very excited for the QWERTY N but hopefully these renders are fake just bc I dont know how the straight keyboard will work as opposed to the curved version.</p>
<p>Traded my BB Bold on Verizon for an iPhone 4 almost 2 years ago but if RIM can put a huge battery, decent camera, and a 3.0-3.5&quot; high resolution screen into the QWERTY N I may bite and dump my iPhone.</p>
<p>I think there is room for Android, Windows Phone 8, and Blackberry I hope RIM makes it!</p>
<p>Kind of like the fools who watched video on iPod classics.</p>
<p>Keyboard looks more edge to edge than previous models I&#8217;ve seen in house.</p>
<p>That bezel is huge!</p>
<p>Gestures. </p>
<p>None from the side as far as i know.</p>
<p>Peek?</p>
<p>There are absolutely side gestures.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see the point so you have a Blackberry phone and a Windows or MAC laptop why not buy a Windows Phone or an iPhone? Keep it to 1 ecosystem everything is easier.</p>
<p>One ecosystem to me is boring, you&#8217;re getting the same experience over and over. Well for me I get bored easily.</p>
<p>I totally understand but for an average person it&#8217;s a way better option.</p>
<p>Not the argument being made here, but I think a varied ecosystem is better for the average person in terms of fostering innovation.</p>
<p>Apple looks set on developing for the general market and not stirring things up. As an Android user, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the W8 and BB10 launches to see what game changers they can bring to the table.</p>
<p>Not really. A good example is how the iPhone&#8217;s marketshare is nowhere near a reflection of the Mac&#8217;s marketshare</p>
<p>What if only one ecosystem existed since the beginning of smartphones until now? Pick your choice: Blacberry, Windows Mobile, Palm . What? You don&#8217;t like it?</p>
<p>blackberry,  new ipod touch, and surface pro..i would be set</p>
<p>The iPhone and iOS don&#8217;t really share any features.  They are completely different Operating Systems.  A PC with iTunes on it can sync with an iPhone almost as well as a Mac and iPhone sync.</p>
<p>See, I&#8217;d rather have the dev build as my user-end phone.  It seems much more solid than the cheesy &#8220;cases&#8221; manufacturers always put around their devices&#8230;  Reflects a more &#8220;minimalist&#8221; approach, an approach I wish more companies would adopt.  It&#8217;s the basic KISS rule.</p>
<p>Oops, almost forgot to link to the dev model:</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn3.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/5787437/blackberry-dev-alpha-b-l-series-30-verge-1020_gallery_post.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looks like a Lumia 800</p>
<p>The L-Series is going to be exactly like that except the top and bottom will be a little less bulky and the corners will be rounded.</p>
<p>RIM made Vimeo remove the original video&#8230; but BGR has another video. It&#8217;s just a marketing video.</p>
<p>I forgot the link to BGR&#8230; her eis the actual video: <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/09/28/blackberry-10-phones-leak-qwerty/" target="_blank">http://www.bgr.com/2012/09/28/blackberry-10-phones-leak-qwerty/</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d buy the qwerty keyboard version &#8211; always liked the keyboard on BB devices.</p>
<p>I do love portrait QWERTY devices and thats not bad at all. If only it was on android</p>
<p>Who needs qwerty keyboard if there are no phone and other keys? Those who need pure touch screen have already migrated to Android.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t type emails with the call button.</p>
<p>Link to the actual video: <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/09/28/blackberry-10-phones-leak-qwerty/" target="_blank">http://www.bgr.com/2012/09/28/blackberry-10-phones-leak-qwerty/</a></p>
<p>Thanks. Interesting ad concept actually. Any chance they can pull off that celebrity line up though?</p>
<p>The slate looks like a Droid X to me</p>
<p>this is what i was going to say.  I just got rid of mine about 2 weeks ago, and looking at that gave me flashbacks!    its just missing the physical buttons!</p>
<p>I really want the QWERTY version. I&#8217;ve always liked that form factor since I got a curve 8530, but obviously the OS was old, cramped, etc. BB10 looks like all the things I love about blackberry plus finally up to speed and then some with everyone else. Sign me up!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one ugly touch phone</p>
<p>L series would look good if they chopped the top and bottom bezels, then increased the bottom bezel a bit</p>
<p>Kinda want bb10 now&#8230;.</p>
<p>Did he just say &#8220;Blackburry&#8221; ?</p>
<p>How else would you pronounce it?</p>
<p>The N-Series looks fabulous!  I&#8217;d much rather the curve on the keyboard like the 9900, but other than that I can&#8217;t wait for it to come out.  January can&#8217;t come soon enough.</p>

<p>I kinda feel for the people in this campaign&#8230;. I&#8217;m the phone is fine, but writing a short story and having to produce a short film sounds kinda awful.</p>
<p>BB, Y U NO DIE?!?!</p>
<p>I really like the design of the N series. Very nice RIM.</p>
<p>I will shit in my hat and eat it if they sell more than 12 of these. RIM is dead. Sad to say it but there finished.</p>
<p>Can we hold you to that? Youtube video and all.</p>
<p>A promise is a promise. I&#8217;ll  just have to make sure to eat a lot of corn in the days before it&#8217;s released.</p>
<p>Can we draw up a legal contract holding you to this?</p>
<p>I, AbuAyyoub AKA &#8220;Tha 1337 gangsta&#8221;, Do hereby swear on my eternal 1337ness and GeekCred that if RIM sells more than 12 units of the above mentioned mobile device(s) ( If they ever manage to release them ) I  will in fact partake in the eating of said shit-hat.</p>

<p>I would have been the first to agree with you but, I know I love a physical qwerty . So while I probably wouldn&#8217;t use it as my primary phone as a work phone I think it would be perfect.</p>
<p>Get ready boy.</p>
<p>Wait, both of those phones have rounded corners. IS BB jumping on the copy train? I would bet the farm Apple is readying it&#8217;s army of Zombie Lawyers as we speak.</p>
<p>No you are wrong, Google wants to go back to their original Android design. Before the iPhone.</p>
<p>I am getting me one  of those.  BB keyboard I miss you &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>QUestion I am new to this site, are they always bashing rim like everyone else.  Are they credible.  The dieter guy seems to be unbiased and at least taking a look at it without &#8220;hate&#8221;  but the Jochua guy or whatever is a hater, and drunk!!  I just saw the podcast and if I was his boss I will fire him now.  Ridiculous!! LOL!!</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve as I&#8217;m concerned The Verge is a top notch tech site. Given that this site was created by people who were upset by Engadget&#8217;s desire for a site about based around getting page views, I&#8217;d say The Verge is a solid site.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always going to be people who don&#8217;t like the way a website is handled, but over all, I love their articles and the tops they cover.</p>
<p>facepalm</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the first QWERTY device in a long time I&#8217;ve been excited about!</p>
<p>If Gary Oldman is one of the celebrities who gets a Blackberry, I&#8217;m sure he will make a sequel to &#8220;Take Flight&#8221;</p>
<p>Beautiful design</p>
<p>I think the QWERTY one can find niche in today&#8217;s cell phone market. But the all touch screen one basically has no chance.</p>
<p>Dat qwerty. Really hoping BlackBerry shines. Just a small spark of hope left.</p>
<p>Lets hope the N has a better camera than the 9900.</p>
<p>Definitely buying N-series. No doubt about it!</p>
<p>What the hell is Open Transport Tycoon DeLuxe doing in the &#8220;Open and Astonishing Native SDK&#8221; slide?</p>
<p>Well, I know it runs on a ton of platforms with minimal fuss, but I have no idea either.</p>
<p>Are you kidding? I loved Transport Tycoon and still play the OpenTTD game from time to time. I just wish Chris Sawyer would make a definitive, modern, sequel. Nobody mention Locomotion :-P</p>
<p>I love the game myself, I just don&#8217;t get what does it have to do with RIM&#8217;s APIs, SDKs and stuff.</p>
<p>Transport Tycoon is better, in every way, than RIM&#8217;s SDK.</p>
<p>I remember when I got my first BlackBerry (a Pearl 8100), which must have been circa 2007 and I looked at developing for the platform for fun.. well I gave up before even starting. To put this in perspective, I learned BASIC on the C64 as an exercise to write my own assembler <strong>in</strong> <strong>BASIC</strong>. I continued with 68000 assembler on the Amiga, even where C was a more logical language. Yes.. I like a challenge but RIM&#8217;s SDK environment was more like masochism. Yes RIM, I wrote an assembler in BASIC but your development environment is actually worse than that. No thanks.</p>
<p>OK, I know what your trying to say there but comparing a low level interpreter/assembler development to a high level program development just dosen&#8217;t work. And tbh, programming a BASIC assembler not nessisarily difficuly, just time consuming. Mobile development nowadays takes alot more programming knowhow that making assemblers.</p>
<p>Seriously. If you can&#8217;t figure out webworks your best staying in the low level.</p>
<p>Interesting. I have no problems with iOS development using XCode.</p>
<p>That is like saying all stick shift cars are garbage because you have no problems driving auto. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll say anything you can to try to put down RIM though, so I&#8217;m done trying to convince a fanboy.</p>
<p>No.  No it&#8217;s nothing alike.  RIM has a much maligned development platform but rather than address that I guess it&#8217;s far easier for you write off anybody with this view as a &#8220;fanboy&#8221;.</p>
<p>What kind of fanboy would I be?  A quick scan though my post history shows me posting both negative and positive comments on Apple, Google and Microsoft mobile platforms. The very definite of a fanboy!!</p>
<p>From your verge profile</p>
<p>&#8220;About RobotPi<br />
iPhone, iPad and Mac-using technology enthusiast interested in all cool shiny things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your right, mabey I was to quick to call you a fanboy. You obviously have no reason to favor apple over any other vendor.</p>
<p>Your stuck in 2006 bud. I&#8217;d agree with you that RIM&#8217;s playform WAS maligned. I hated having to screw around with the older blackberry phones. But now, its no more difficult than android or IOS. The problem lies in people being unwilling to accept their favorite tech punching bag is just as viable a platform now as all the ones they preen over.</p>
<p>So you think because I own Apple gear I am an Apple fanboy? It didn&#8217;t occurred to you that I made purchases based on my need and these were the best at the time? Had you read my posting history, you would know that in the past 20 years I&#8217;ve used most platforms: Psion, Palm, PocketPC, H/PC, RIM and iOS. I&#8217;ve only missed webOS and Android, and next year, who knows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve chopped and changed platforms many times, buying into, leaving and re-joining ecosystems numerous times. You know why? Because I put me first and I have no ties to any particular platform.</p>
<p>As for me being stuck ion 2006 regarding RIM&#8217;s SDKs? Actually dude, no, the most dated I could be accused of is being stuck in 2011 because RIM were <a href="http://devblog.blackberry.com/2011/02/thanks-for-the-open-letter-to-rim-developer-relations/">responding</a> to posts like <a href="http://blog.jamiemurai.com/2011/02/you-win-rim/">this</a> quite a lot last year.</p>
<p>If RIM have improved the process and brought it up to par with  Android, iOS and WP7&#8217;s development systems, great. But if so, this has been a very recent development &#8211; excuse the pun.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not rad a single independent developer confirming your view that RIM development is,,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no more difficult than android or IOS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>..and I&#8217;ve love to read more on this.</p>
<p>Well, to be honest, in my opinion anyone using Apple gear is either a technology noob or a fanboy&#8230; there&#8217;s nothing in between.</p>
<p>Although I must admit I&#8217;ve been using an iPhone for a few months before I god fed up with stupid limitations&#8230; but after all, one needs to know what one&#8217;s talking about, right?</p>
<p>(btw. this was before Android became popular and YES, the limitations that drove me back to Windows Mobile are still there&#8230;)</p>
<p>No indeed. Nobody but a &#8220;noob&#8221; or &#8220;fanboy&#8221; would be using a UNIX system with a powerful cross-application scripting language. Stands to reason, right?</p>
<p>UNIX system with a cross application scripting language? You realize that could mean the iphone, the playbook, android, and a host of other devices? The subsystem means nothing if the API&#8217;s and application sources are controlled to the point that it&#8217;s just another point and click system and you can only do what apple lets you.</p>
<p>Actually none of those &#8211; Android, iOS or QNX (PlayBook) are UNIX and none a cross-application scripting language. I was talking about OSX., an OS well known to be used by &#8220;noobs&#8221; and &#8220;fanboys&#8221;.</p>
<p>But well done on not acknowledging RIM&#8217;s poor development tools. Kudos to RIM, though, they do.</p>
<p>Back to engadget with you!</p>
<p>Some people like to have a machine that will just work, even if the capability is limited. The Mac is great for getting basic work done,  and has great multi-media programs out of the box. I know they&#8217;re out there for Windows, but Windows Movie Maker isn&#8217;t nearly as good as iMovie, and both come on the computer.</p>
<p>Wanting something to work isn&#8217;t being a noob. It&#8217;s being realistic. The PC is great until something you thought would run doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And fanboyism&#8230; don&#8217;t get me started. Mac user doesn&#8217;t equal iPhone/iPad/iPod user, but having those things gives you benefits. I actually think WP7 is better than both Android or iOS, and that I don&#8217;t want to pay a premium for an Android device that&#8217;ll only be relevant for about a year.</p>
<p>So, in short, you have no ground for your claims. Anyone accusing someone else who isn&#8217;t obviously trolling of being a fanboy must be a &#8220;rival&#8221; fanboy.</p>
<p>You just pretty much proved that you don&#8217;t work in technology.</p>
<p><img src="http://s11.allstarpics.net/images/orig/k/2/k2p7oxwa9fidawf7.jpg" /></p>
<p>Can someone tell me the name of that character&#8230;<br />
I remember seeing it in some bloody game of mine&#8230;</p>
<p>Strong Bad.</p>
<p>Rim needs to buy WebOS for the patents alone.  Combine the design schemes in WebOS with QNX, and you&#8217;ll have a pretty slick product.</p>
<p>&#8230;that will arrive several years too late for anyone to care.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know; I think there is always a market for good products.  People like different, and pretty soon, they will be so bored out their minds with iOS that they will want something new.  Just look at what happened to IE.  It was king with very little competition, and then Firefox, and now Chrome.   Just because there are two dominant OS&#8217;s now doesn&#8217;t mean others can&#8217;t succeed.  They just have to be good.</p>
<p>Only children get bored with something that simply works. Then again, a lot of kids were crying over twitter when they didn&#8217;t get an iDevice for Christmas, so I may be underestimating them.</p>
<p>No. I don&#8217;t want an iPhone. (OK that&#8217;s a lie I just have T-Mo) but it&#8217;s seriously getting old. Change is good, and for some people not necessary.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t take anyone&#8217;s opinions on any tech site that seriously, when it comes to what the mainstream consumer likes.\</p>
<p>Oh and change is not good. Change can be good. It can also be bad. But &#8216;Change is good&#8217; is just stupid.</p>
<p>Should add to that first paragraph, I let the customer satisfaction polls, desired product polls, and what I hear from various family members, friends, and strangers tell me what consumers like.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only children get bored with something that simply works.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the pace we&#8217;re moving technologically, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true anymore.</p>
<p>Uh, no. Most people are not going to ditch the healthiest, most massive ecosystem (ie. iOS and appstore) because they&#8217;re &#8216;bored&#8217; and just jump ship into something else without that ecosystem, unless it offers some MASSIVE advantages in doing so. Which is why people didn&#8217;t jump ship to Win7 phones from iOS. Apart from tech-fanatics posting on tech boards on the internet, people want something that is familiar and works well. They&#8217;re not going to ditch the familiarity iOS and all it&#8217;s benefits for something they don&#8217;t know.  As it stands, I have trouble thinking of what possible incentives and advantages RIM can come up with in order to make the new platform an attractive proposition for consumers and developers compared to the giants of Apple, Google, and Microsoft- who have a massive headstart both in terms of product maturity, and developer support/ecosystem.</p>
<p>..not to mention RIMS tainted reputation. I dont see them inspiring confidence of continuity at this point, especially when their future is so up in the air. We know Apple, Microsoft, or Google are not going to close shop anytime soon, and I feel safe investing in all those ecosystems (iOS, Android, Win7). BBOS 10? Not so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;True intelligence doesn&#8217;t follow the majority. By definition, there&#8217;s already enough people doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Windows Phone 7 doesn&#8217;t target iOS or Galaxy SII/Nexus/&#8220;real&#8221; android users. They&#8217;r being smart and hitting the budget sector with cheap devices that work well. They do have an ecosystem, and people will get locked in, and soon enough WP7 will take off. It make take three years, but so did everything else.</p>
<p>Windows phone, if nothing else, has Windows, Office, Skype, Bing, Nokia and Windows Live lined up to give it momentum. They can also afford to &#8220;do an Xbox&#8221; again, i.e. burn cash until it reaches critical mass.</p>
<p>Even with all that I would not say Windows Phone is &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; to, say, reach parity with Android. It might, it might not, a lot depends on what happens with Google and Android in the next 3 years.</p>
<p>RIM, on the other hand, shows every sign of following Nokia-Meego, &amp; Palm-WebOS into the recycling bin of history..</p>
<p>Barrier to entry to try a new browser &#8211; 5 minutes to download.<br />
Barrier to entry to try a new smartphone &#8211; potentially several hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Was just going to comment on the fact that people not only invest in the devices, but the apps as well.</p>
<p>I have, quite possibly, hundreds of dollars sunk into the Android Market. I don&#8217;t think I could ever go Windows Phone or iOS just based on the investment I&#8217;ve made in Android apps.</p>
<p>It rarely happens that one is dropped for the other. It&#8217;s more of a case that you get a second device for a specific feature, start using it more and more, and gradually phase out the old device over time.</p>
<p>The lifespan of an app, like any software, isn&#8217;t much more than a couple of years anyway.</p>
<p>But switching from IE to Firefox requires moving bookmarks. Switching mobile platforms requires a ton more work if you actually used your device in the first place.</p>
<p>Finding similar apps (The biggest time spent is here, not to mention money if you actually buy apps for your platform), exporting/importing data, transferring saved passwords, PIM information, etc.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t move between WP7/iOS/Android/BB10 but seeing as they all have their own services/app stores it makes it a lot more difficult.</p>
<p>But the smartphone market is still growing overall, which means that most people buying a device now don&#8217;t already own a smartphone which is what can give BB10 a chance. But RIM has to remember one thing. They are not competing with iOS 5, WP7, and Android 4.0, but rather iOS 6, WP8, and Android 4.X which will be coming out in the next year or so.</p>
<p>I agree that switching smartphone platforms is more difficult, but people do it all the time now.  I don&#8217;t see that changing.  If RIM could make a really slick device with a really sweet OS, some people may jump ship.  Just look at the move to blueray which require people to re-buy their movies.  Now they are having to buy them again for streaming convenience.  In the end people want the latest and greatest, and most of them will be inconvenience to get it.  Neither iOS, WP7, or (especially) Android is perfect, so there is always room for another company to come in and put all the best ideas together.  WebOS design on a QNX platform would be pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Because a dead product can help a dying one. No, even better, homebrew developers are the future!</p>
<p>More like two broken cars can be put together to make a working one.  It&#8217;s like going to the junk yard for a working carburetor.</p>
<p>No it&#8217;s more like two turkeys don&#8217;t make an eagle.</p>
<p>Actually, I buy a lot of used car parts from junk yards. They&#8217;re pretty cheap too.</p>
<p>Me too.</p>
<p>It would&#8217;ve been an excellent pairing.  WebOS still has enthusiasts, even among developers.  BBOS doesn&#8217;t.  However, QNX might be the answer <strong>IF</strong> it provides a smoother path for in-porting of apps.  BB&#8217;s only real hope is Android developers at this point, and unless their phones and tablets come down dramatically in price, even that&#8217;s a wash.  Why would anyone pay $250 for a BB on contract (or $600 off) that offers &#8220;Android compatibility&#8221; when they just get an actual Android device for less?  I know that if I could get a Droid Pro with improved specs and a trackpad, I&#8217;d be asking, &#8220;Research-In-who?&#8221;</p>
<p>And a&#8230; trackpad?</p>
<p>that&#8217;s probably the only way RIM could go worse than it is now. It&#8217;d take longer than late 2012 before a WebOS/BB10 hybrid was released.</p>
<p>(nevermind, there is something worse: they could adopt Symbian and release Symbian BBs in late 2012)</p>
<p>Please. . . they&#8217;re half way there in copying WebOS as it is.  :p</p>
<p>You&#8217;re way behind the times, today&#8217;s <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2012/01/17/samsung-looking-buy-rim/">speculation</a>, which is already spreading, is that Samsung may buy RIM for its patents. Makes sense? No. But nor does a lot of stuff that is happening.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Samsung needs to buy RIM for patents, at least not the patents that everyone thinks.</p>
<p> If anything, they&#8217;d buy RIM for the enterprise technology, as Samsung seems to be pushing enterprise lately (which certainly makes sense, as it is a way to stand out among other Android OEMs).</p>
<p>The playbook would make an awesome Windows tablet for sure!!!!</p>
<p>I have a sneaky suspicion that Verizon is holding out to be major partner with BB 10 again. I just see the lack of adoption to WP7 as a clear sign they have other plans. Anyone else get that vibe?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I agree. Carriers except AT&amp;T (and to a lesser extent T-Mo) seem to have developed WP7-phobia. Nothing new on Verizon or Sprint.</p>
<p>Verizon has the UGLIEST in house phones&#8230;.they still have actual buttons for home, back, menu, and app tray&#8230;makes them look dated right from the gate.</p>
<p>OMG..I just noticed that contacts screen.  Is it actually aping that bag of fail called Metro???  If so, their finished.  FINISHED.</p>
<p>I was actually thinking that it looked pretty good&#8230; as does Metro.</p>
<p>And ICS.</p>
<p>What, if I might ask, do you actually prefer?</p>
<p>Metro is the future!!! Windows just needs to stop robbing us by ok-ing single core processing. Just Dual Core and let the OS have room to stretch and we keep some of our dollars.</p>
<p>I may be in the minority on this one, but I still think the BlackBerry keyboard + a modern, functional OS = potential success. Teens still buy BlackBerries for the messaging (albeit in smaller numbers than before) and enterprises still like them. They&#8217;re not dead yet. Now, if they haven&#8217;t had a major release and marketing push by the end of 2012, then they&#8217;re dead. You can only go off of past name recognition for so long.</p>
<p>You are not in the minority.  I use a BlackBerry because I love the form factor.  I think BB7 works quite well, but I am also quite curious to see what BB10 ends up like on phones.  I don&#8217;t think RIM is dead.  I, for one, want to see them come back.  I guess we&#8217;ll find out by this time next year.</p>
<p>In my opinion the palm pre and blackberry torch 9810 is the perfect form factor. If they could make these a bit slimmer, hardware  wise that would be perfect. I find touch screen  typing a choir.  That&#8217;s for me of course,  I understand people have different tastes.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Motorola make one of those *coughcoughAdmiralcoughcough and it got like a five?</p>
<p>Motorola, to their credit, is really giving it a go in making the &#8220;Android Blackberry,&#8221; but they&#8217;re not quite there yet.  In trying to give you the advantages of both platforms, Motorola winds up harming both &#8211; Android (and its apps) suffer on the reduced screen size and strange resolution, while the lack of a trackpad and RIM&#8217;s security and messaging features make the devices less efficient in ways to a crowd that prizes efficiency above all.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s good that Moto continues to try.  The tech nerd ideal of all phones as basically variations on the Galaxy Note is never going to fly the more consumers trade their dumbphones for smartphones.  There&#8217;s still a huge market for devices with keyboards and superb communication abilities among people who don&#8217;t give one whit about media capabilities on their cell phone.</p>
<p>They also made the Pro and Pro+. Especially the second one is very good, but for some mysterious reason availability is a real problem. (I.e., try to find one in your country of choice&#8230;)</p>
<p>or an inverse, reversal, and BB becomes the it device because of it&#8217;s not everywhere&#8230;..everyone wants to feel special&#8230;.</p>
<p>This glacial pace RIM is taking is not something that will work out for them.  They, like Windows Mobile, will fade to nearly 0% market share and 0% market relevance before anything exciting and new is ready for public release.  Where they go from there is tough to say but it won&#8217;t be an easy journey for them.</p>
<p>Heh. I think it&#8217;s funny. I was holding out for BBX phones but I caved yesterday and ordered a BB9900.  I tried to find Android devices with a good qwerty keyboard, but it just isn&#8217;t happening.  But I think that once the 9900 comes with OS7.1 and the wifi hotspot, I&#8217;ll be doing ok with replacing my iphone with an ipod touch, and using a small form factor android tablet.  That should basically handle anything I need to do which is basic email / chat and the other devices for games and some apps (e.g. GeoCache isn&#8217;t available on BB&#8230;.)</p>
<p>Did you look at a Dell Venue Pro? Also you gave up an iPhone?(!)</p>
<p>iPhone vs Android vs WP7 seems like a taste/preference issue.</p>
<p>iPhone vs the current Blackberry selection seems like a sanity issue, unless there are some very specific features that you can&#8217;t live without.</p>
<p>I am going to agree 100% with you.  I am running 7.1 on my 9900.  I just find the BlackBerry keyboard a cut above the rest and the new 7.1 os (what 6.0 should have been)  with the addition of the mobile hotspot makes it a lot easier to utilize my iPod Touch on the go. I use my iPod for all my time wasters, or as other call it &#8220;down time&#8221; (and I don&#8217;t mean that in a bad way).  For me, BlackBerry is still the most efficient device to handle messaging (instant, email, social media) and above all, I still feel it handles voice calls better then any other phones i&#8217;ve used.</p>
<p>or BB9900 and Galaxy Note&#8230;</p>
<p>The king is dead, long live the king.</p>
<p>I took one look at that headline then asked myself &#8220;WHy didn&#8217;t Dieter just do a video about this&#8221;</p>
<p>just a footnote:  apps are developed on PlayBook using the AIR SDK, which is not the same thing as Flash for mobile web browsers.</p>
<p>Maybe RIM should just go Android.  Honestly, it seems like the only apps they are going to get are Android apps, why not just go with Android itself?</p>
<p>Android is a networks biggest nightmare.</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;ll survive</p>
<p>They will&#8230;I sold my BB32 Playbook to Best Buy, and just recently purchased another 32Playbook&#8230;why&#8230;&#8230;because it&#8217;s not apple, android, or windows, but I have all three OS, Blackberry still has a buzz about them&#8230;</p>
<p>Never mind, according to BGR, RIM are:<br />
(a) Going to launch new 7 in and 10 in Playbook this year<br />
(b) Sell out to Samsung</p>
<p>BGR has less clue than the RIM CEOs</p>
<p>RIM is in the hole and the more time it takes to bring a new strategy the faster iOS and Android will increase and the Heavier it will be to get back, Firefox is not as different in this.</p>
<p>There will be leal customers but thats not going to save them</p>
<p>I already gave up RIM, Much more happier with Android, but like always, There&#8217;s always a chance, let&#8217;s see what happens</p>
<p>Sorry wrong. Get it right and all will be fine. Wndows phone is about to show you. A better OS than iPhone plus $100 million marketing campaign and windows 8 is going to have Apple shitting bricks this year. Android ..meh&#8230; it&#8217;s basically crap.</p>
<p>People like yourself have been spouting that since basically WP7 was first demoed.</p>
<p>Then is was &#8220;Wait for Mango&#8221;, then &#8220;wait for Sea Ray&#8221;, now what we we waiting for? CES 2012? No, that&#8217;s ended. How about Windows 8?</p>
<p>The difference now would be that the offerings are actually great.</p>
<p>Despite liking the platform for a long time, I wouldn&#8217;t have switched until now.</p>
<p>With the Lumia 900 coming out, I may just do it (only being held back by termination fees with Verizon&#8230;). I think you&#8217;ll find a lot of people with the same intention.</p>
<p>WP7&#8217;s problem has, to me, been that it was offering iPhone guts in an Android shell, hardware-wise. The iPhone is a great phone, but it isn&#8217;t being sold based on its spec sheet (until, to a degree, the 4S). And the Samsung Galaxy SII&#8217;s are impressive phones in a relatively pathetic casing.</p>
<p>WP7 doesn&#8217;t require heavy duty power to run smoothly, so the spec sheets can be misleading to consumers familiar with Android OEM marketing. And until now, we (in the US) have had the Focus, the Quantum, the HD7/S, the Surround, the Trophy, and the Arrive; all fairly mediocre from an exterior design perspective (although I happen to have an affinity for the HD7).</p>
<p>Consider that: trying to sell a device with an unfamiliar OS, seemingly weak specs, limited app support (by comparison) and not even a compelling design to hold you over?</p>
<p>The new generation is more promising (see the HTC Titan and the Focus S, despite Samsung&#8217;s sadistic devotion to cheap plastic), and the upcoming Titan 2 and Lumia 900 look like the most sellable hardware the platform has had.</p>
<p>Failure is still a possibility, but I doubt it in the long run. Microsoft seems fully committed to the platform, and is embracing the design language wholly. They seem to be willing to throw as much money as necessary for the success of WP7, and if those leaked slides are to be trusted, there are some &#8220;superphones&#8221; on the horizon.</p>
<p>If this was any other company I would say 6 months to late. But seeing as they have a good business following they may be able to get that fourth spot&#8230;</p>
<p>But companies rarely buy employees phones at this point. They all want Droids, Atrixes, and iPhones.</p>
<p>I get a train that goes to London everyday and every business man/woman/child has a blackberry followed by another smartphone,</p>
<p>A lot of those BBs are 2-3 years old and aren&#8217;t going to get replaced.  Some will, mostly amongst employees that need a dedicated line for making business calls, but it will be a small percentage.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t they <em>already </em> got that fourth spot?</p>
<p>Whether or not they have trumped WebOS for that position, the point, as Mr. Miller wrote out in an excellent Verge post earlier, is that 4th is not a viable business position to be in. That&#8217;s what Elop forced Nokia to understand, why they abandoned Meego, and why Whitman &amp;co put WebOS out to pasture. In the world of the smartphone OS 4th is a sure road to Chapter 11.</p>
<p>I think specific support from an area such as business could make a difference in the short term something MeeGo and WebOS did not have. I think long term Blackberry will be pretty dead though.</p>
<p>And in terms of fourth spot. What I meant is that without the business support they would already be dead. Should have made the post clearer really. I agree though fourth place is not a good (or even average) place to be</p>
<p>Great article. Very good read.</p>
<p>Well regardless they need to keep it moving. I mean even Mircrosoft has gotten its ish together in the mobile space and they move at a&#8230;&#8230;(whatever is slower then a snail)&#8216;s pace. Since the timeline is set they better deliver on a solid product. Having a &#8220;blackberry&#8221; used to mean something. Now&#8230;..well it still means something&#8230;..just nothin&#8217; nice.</p>
<p>Blackberry 10 has to be mindblowingly awesome for Blackberry to survive.  As this article shows, it is not and they are behind.  They need to hire double to coders to get this thing competitive before it ships in phones or they face complete failure.</p>
<p>That whole iPhone/Android thing in the US is a blip. Third world countries are where the action is.</p>
<p>Third world countries will gladly buy whatever the public in the first world thinks is awesome and a status symbol, if they can afford to. It is surprisingly easy, and will become even easier, to adapt platforms like Android to lower-end phones, seeing how the lower end is catching up. Soon enough, the Third World will be full of tiny green Androids.</p>
<p>Its going to take RIMM another 4-5 years to just &#8220;catch up&#8221; to IOS and Android. By that time IOS and Android will be on their 7th or 8th software releases and another 2-3 years ahead minimum. That 4-5 year time is assuming that RIMM has enough software developer talent on staff that can develop and execute at the same pace as Apple and Google/Android. Yeah good luck RIMM. Way too little and too late. You should have started this in 2007 when the iPhone was announced.</p>
<p>&#8230; or the long stream down the gurgler?</p>
<p>So RIM: What exactly is your value proposition with this? Where do you see yourself in the mobile space relative to the others?</p>
<p>This image deserves a re-post:</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/6740487/alec_saunders_1020_large_verge_medium_landscape.jpg" /></p>
<p>bloody awesome click!!</p>
<p>This is the company that publicly and apologeticly screwed indie developers&#8230; Im sorry but its payback time. Every developer was once an indie developer.</p>
<p>The people running RIM are not the same people that were running it a year ago. Give them a break and let&#8217;s see if they can turn it around.</p>
<p>How can you not keep on lovin&#8217; this guy?</p>
<p>I guessing that he is singing live in that picture?</p>
<p>Well if you listen to Windows Phone users, even 30,000 apps are enough for an ecosystem, and I think they are already half way there.</p>
<p>Numbers do not count, but high profile apps do. Wp managed to port several high profile apps by using Microsoft&#8217;s money. RIM can&#8217;t afford that luxury.</p>
<p>I hear ya. At the same time however, RIM still has close to 2 Billion in the bank with zero debt. And considering they are going &#8220;All in&#8221; with BB10, they might as well use it for something.</p>
<p>(y)</p>
<p>If the apps you want/need are in the App store, you bet 30k apps is enough. Fart and flashlight apps are not really what I want on my device.</p>
<p>I find maybe a dozen or two compelling apps in the Apple app store. I just don&#8217;t have the time in the day to use all the awesome new apps that I&#8217;m sure are popping up all the time. They tend to be novelties, tried a few times, then discarded.</p>
<p>I totally get that there are tens of millions of people out there with unique wants and needs, and having hundreds of thousands of apps allows the app store to likely have something for everyone.</p>
<p>But, at the end of the day, if there are solid apps in an app store (no idea of the MS app store has solid apps or not), and as long as what you need is there, who really cares if there are several hundred thousand more apps?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a WP user and I can tell there are solid apps in the WP app store. But it&#8217;s not iOS, so it doesn&#8217;t have the couple years lead were there are enough decent apps in every single category (enough to push all the crap to the bottom).</p>
<p>So if your into a certain gaming genre or you want an app for your small local bank, the best in class might not be there, or there are only a dozen options instead of several dozen. Sometimes there are alternatives that the average person might not know about (like the excellent Pandora apps that can&#8217;t use the word &#8220;Pandora&#8221; in their title) But a lot of the &#8220;big boys&#8221; so to speak are there</p>
<p>Add in that things are not looking good with the news from TI about decision on to cede the consumer mark(OMAP processors).  I&#8217;m fairly certain RIM was planning to stick with them for their processors.</p>
<p>So much for editing into a coherent comment.  Verge&#8230;where is our editing?</p>
<p>Proofread.</p>
<p>BB10 phones will be using Snapdragon S4.</p>

<p>I believe if you go into /var/log/ on the dev alpha b, you&#8217;ll see a folder that will give you the answer.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a dev device and gave up on BB10 when about a month ago they released there new features in the SDK&#8230;but oh&#8230;no documents.  As a specific example, documents for their crypto library/API.</p>
<p>Blackberry needs a reset like Microsoft did with their brand, logo, UI, product line and hardware. I hope they have time and money for all their wars.</p>
<p>Actually, the BB logo is quite good — if anything, I&#8217;d expect a rebranding to be worse. Also, rebranding at this point would be worthless. Rebrand when you are moving in the right direction, not the wrong one. It&#8217;d just be a distraction, and it&#8217;d cost money that they don&#8217;t really have.</p>
<p>I disagree. BlackBerry has a lot of loyal power users but there&#8217;s a lot of regular people who were/are fed up with their previous blackberries. They need to convince those people that this is a new start with fresh, stable hardware and software.</p>
<p>I actually enjoyed this write up on RIM for a change on here.</p>
<blockquote>…for a change…</blockquote>
<p>I think you mean <em>as usual</em>.</p>
<p>Microsoft should just buy blackberry, its the only way either one of them will gain smartphone market share.</p>
<p>Im rooting for them even though i plan in november to upgrade my torch 2 to a HTC 8x or Lumia 920, i just dont believe they will have the hard core apps that other companies have like kindle, skype  etc. i had a playbook and trust me ever time i brought it to work, my coworkers with ipads and transformers would be showing off cool apps that they have id be green with envy because the appworld on bb sucks soo badly its not funny. THey waited too long to do all this what they are doing now, this should have been done from last year or at-least the playbook os be made into their mobile platform on phones and then port up to BB10 next year  but alas no vision.</p>
<p>I wonder which apps the transformer has you have missed? I use my Playbook mostly for web, email, news (rss), video and e-book reading and most people I know who own iPads use it for the same purpose plus some games 90% of the time. Though I think all tablets suck for playing real good games.</p>
<p>Anyway B10 can run Android apps just like the Playbook OS already can. For example I use the Kindle app of Android on my Playbook. Works well.</p>
<p>BB10 needs Skype.<br />
Skype is a core business app that is vital on a business oriented phone.</p>
<p>Pity its owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Thanks for not being biased this time Verge. :)</p>
<p>The Verge: never biased, always bias.</p>
<p>Great article Dieter. Nice and balanced.</p>
<p>After all the haters and the jokes thrown at RIM this past year, I am really interested to see where things go for them.  I was very happy to read the recents stuff on BB10.  It sounds like it will be a decent and interesting OS.  The worst thing that could have happened would be lameness.  It looks like it has enough spark to overcome that.</p>
<p>RIM is an odd, fairly unique creature.  I hope it comes good again.</p>
<p>Improbable but not impossible.</p>
<p>Wow, I am truly impressed by the objectivity of this article. This is why I come to Verge.</p>
<p>As a long time blackberry user, I&#8217;m excited to see how blackberry 10 looks at launch. I want to switch to an iphone because everyone I know has one, and it is becoming a major inconvenience not to have one, but I am painfully aware of how much I am going to hate the lack of true multitasking. I&#8217;ve also thought about switching to WP8. The only thing that has really stopped me from leaving blackberry is the fact that neither the iphone nor the Lumia 920 will be available for tmobile (from which i will NEVER switch thanks to their cheap prices and unlimited internet.) I currently enjoy free 3G browsing on my playbook via blackberry bridge, and I only hope that RIM gets enough major apps on Appworld to justify me sticking to BB.</p>
<p>I am running with an iPhone 4S right now and have used Android 2.3 and Blackberry 5 or 6 in the past.  I have to say, if Blackberry ever got their crap together and had decent developer support with a decent app library, I would probably go for a BB10 device.  It just seems really unlikely that many developers will spend the time and resources to invest in what amounts to a dying platform.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the biggest hurdle.<br />
You have to write an iPhone app, mutate that to work well on an iPad, then all the fun with Android.   And THEN perhaps a WinPhone app.  Maybe a Windows 8 app.  AND THEN do we have the time and resources to write a BB10 version?</p>
<p>PhoneGap!</p>
<p>And yeah, you can run recompiled Android apps on BB10.<br />
That&#8217;s fine and dandy, but if you end up running Android apps all the time, then, well, you might as well buy an Android phone.</p>
<p>If RIM can achieve good numbers with BB10 at launch, then it may quickly surpass WP8 in he minds of developers. They have the development tools but they are currently lacking developer mindshare.</p>
<p>Once developers learn how easy it is to port an iOS app to BB10, it may get 2nd billing after the iPhone (only because of how easy it can be).  There have been a few different reports about developers porting there iOS app to BB10 flawlessly in less than 2 days with 1 or 2 programmers.</p>
<p>I keep hearing that the AppWorld apps make the most money compared to their alternative sources. Food for thought&#8230;</p>
<p>Why do so many people think RIM&#8217;s chances are &#8220;slim&#8221;?  I think a huge number of people are craving a powerful <strong>icon-based</strong> alternative to iOS that doesn&#8217;t lag (cue the same android fanboys that claimed there was no lag to be seen on ICS)  or provide inconsistent experiences across devices.  Seriously, BBOS 10 is shaping up to be extremely powerful.  True multi-tasking and great specs in a 4.3&quot; phone, all speeding along with QNX.  And for me at least, most important is the presence of  alternative browsers that come equipped with text reflow.</p>
<p>Well, the icon based alternative could be Firefox OS, seeing as you can easily install it onto flagship Android phones.</p>
<p>Also, that is a great thought on the browsers. Seeing as RIM doesn&#8217;t really benefit from users using their browser over others, I doubt they will limit 3rd party browsers in any way. Multitasking and messaging will also be strong points. BB10 is shaping up to be a great OS.</p>
<p>Can you clarify why people would want &#8220;icon-based&#8221;? Genuinely curious.</p>
<p>Both W8 and Android can put &#8220;icons&#8221; (direct app shortcuts) on the home screen, if necessary. I feel like I&#8217;m missing something.</p>
<p>when bb10 launches along side the new hardware and the good reviews start rolling in hope u trolls commit suicide (not literally) but yh, i think there is progress and good one at that. the majority of ppl i know hold two smartphone device one is always a bb the other is either an android device or an iPhone and is usually the latter. i&#8217;m a university student writing from london, so i dont understand why ppl on here say the bb platform is unnecessary because here bb still thrives but u need to understand bb devices appeal more to the 13-25ish age group unless ur bb device is 4 work. Most devs wudnt own a bb device i wudnt expect it too as well most of u are anti-social computer nerds anyway!</p>
<p><em>note to the trolls n pettiest</em>:  i cudnt care less of my spelling i just type faster this way lol</p>
<p><em>lol forgot to conclude</em></p>
<p>and most <em>prominent</em> devs dont fall into that category or android modders who think that they are some sort devs just cuz they got a custom rom running on their device</p>
<p>tldr</p>
<p>fuck you devs, i wouldn&#8217;t have a drink with you so i don&#8217;t want your app on my bb</p>
<p>Thanks Dieter for a great article! BTW the leaked shots of the BB10 QWERTY look really nice!</p>
<p>Definately excited about BB10. Does anybody know specifically why BB10 will be better/smoother at multitasking compared to Android (unless Windows Phone is better, which I don&#8217;t think it is, I hear it is very similar to iOS, which is what I have experienced). I assume it&#8217;s QNX, but any technical details and how background tasking will work?</p>
<p>Best explanation I have is there is an inherent performance hit in Android due to the Dalvik Virtual machine running on the Linux Kernel.</p>
<p>The Linux Kernel itself is plenty fast, but the virtual machine (which is pretty much kinda java for all intents and purposes) is just slower than &#8220;native code&#8221; .</p>
<p>This is one reason the iPhone is always appearing faster &#8211; native code is easier to optimize and just runs faster. Same reason Windows Phone is so fast. <br />
QNX is a very sophisticated and responsive OS.</p>
<p>*I am not a dev, nor am I a programmer or computer scientist. My answers may be way off. Please feel free to correct me :) *</p>
<p>That is close enough from my understanding.  It also has something to do with QNX being a real-time operating system, but I don&#8217;t even know what that means&#8230;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if you have used a PlayBook, but the reason multitasking is so good on it (not technical, but just a users opinion), is because you can have multiple apps running at the same time.  I&#8217;m not talking about how iOS has music playing while you are in another app, BB10 will have full apps running at full proccessing power and speed at the same time and the phone (or playbook) won&#8217;t slow down at all.  It also helps having easy and intuitive gesture controls that make switching between app smooth and seemless.  iOS&#8217;s way of app switching seems so outdated once you switch apps on a PlayBook.</p>
<p>That being said, imo, the most important part of BB10&#8217;s multitasking (and RIM&#8217;s mindset in general) is that they like allowing the user to have some control over how things operate.  On the PlayBook, you have the option to allow all apps to run full speed at once, or you can change the setting to have apps in the background freeze when you are in a different app.  It&#8217;s similar to how iOS does it, but it doesn&#8217;t require the app to reload at all when you switch back into it.  Some of my iPad apps require a 30 second reload every time I switch back into it.  Even if I switch out for 5 seconds, it still has to reload everything when I switch back in.</p>
<p><a href="http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/real-time-operating-system" target="_blank">http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/real-time-operating-system</a></p>
<p>Now that you said that, it narrowed down what I had to search for for an explanation. The link has a good basic explanation.</p>
<p>So it just comes down to how they are managed? I know that Dalvik is not as snappy, I just didn&#8217;t know that would effect multitasking. In retrospect, that makes sense.</p>
<p>I think this article is fantastic. Great reporting Dieter. Such a refreshing, objective tone.</p>
<p>Read my updates and review at <a href="http://Read my updates and review at texcitement.blogspot.in/2012/09/blackberry-10-ready-for-january-2013.html">texcitement.blogspot.in/2012/09/blackberry-10-ready-for-january-2013.html</a></p>
<p>Seriously, people are placing too much emphasis on apps.  How many can one use? Or really use? 10? 20? 30 would even be too many.  RIM need to just court the 100 most common apps and call it a day.<br />
Consumer are just spoiled.  And if enterprise user are too concern with missing games on their berries?  I as a boss will certainly be concern my employees are spending too much time playing on their phone and not being productive at their respective jobs.</p>
<p>Same. For me, I don&#8217;t use a lot of productivity apps. Most my apps are just games because they are free and their, though I do not require this in my smartphone. Maybe that is just me though&#8230;</p>
<p>thank you Dieter for the objective and excellent article.  This is why I choose the Verge to be my first port of call when logging in.</p>
<p>RIP RIM.</p>
<p>And to be clear, I&#8217;m not rooting for them to fail, but even Windows Phone 8 at this point looks like a more viable OS with a clear path forward. =/</p>
<p>There was a moment where you thought Windows 8 <del>wouldn&#8217;t</del> beat RIM? Really?</p>
<p>It should still be noted that RIM has sold more BlackBerries in the last 2 quarters than all of Windows Phone sales combined&#8230; so nothing is certain.</p>
<p>Please let us also know what your sources are for these sales figures. I&#8217;m intrigued.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised if it&#8217;s true. I work in a phone shop and we sell probably 10 blackberrys to every windows phone. I love my Lumia 800 to bits but it&#8217;s just so hard to educate people on windows phone.</p>
<p>Its definitely picking up though, I honestly believe MS are going to clean up in the next 2 years. The products are getting there and theyre being super aggressive with updates and app procurement etc.</p>
<p><img src="http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/7928/ahoyhoy.jpg" /></p>
<p>To be honest, WP8 isn&#8217;t a burning ship. It&#8217;s more of a ship under construction. I agree about BB10, though. It&#8217;s burning badly, even before construction.</p>
<p>In comparison, Android is a huge ship with a large but badly disorganized population. iOS is a ship that&#8217;s well polished but keeps shooting torpedoes at the ships around, screaming &#8220;YOU COPIED ME!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not an entirely accurate&#8230; but an entirely amusing analogy of the mobile OS battles :P</p>
<p>What comments make it inaccurate?</p>
<p>just that we don&#8217;t know yet about WP8.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that Windows Phones isn&#8217;t a burning ship, it&#8217;s that Windows Phones are 3 ships.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old wooden hulled sailing ship (WinMo)<br />
It&#8217;s a high-concept yacht, that&#8217;s been abandoned in drydock. (WP7)<br />
And, it&#8217;s a brand new commercial freighter that hasn&#8217;t been launched yet. (WP8)</p>
<p>I suppose I&#8217;ll agree with that.</p>
<blockquote>It’s burning badly, even before construction.</blockquote>
<p>I love this metaphor just for how conceptually weird it is!  I&#8217;m imagining boxed boat-building goods, quietly sitting in several warehouses across the world, discreetly on fire&#8230;</p>
<p>more like fiats rusting before they&#8217;re assembled.</p>
<p>Also, the captain on the HMS Apple loves to bring out the whip and doesn&#8217;t care for his crew and passengers, while on the Android ship they take three hours just to change course to avoid the riff. Nobody really takes command there, and things get only done if someone &#8220;feels like it&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think WP8 is a burning boat here. It has a lot potential to fight back along with Nokia awesome hardware once Windows 8 hits the market and people get familiar with Metro UI. I should expect that WP8 will take off in the 2nd quarter of 2013.</p>
<p>On the contrary, RIM will just fall with BB10. Just too late&#8230; They should of gone MSFT&#8217;s way if you are already late  for the party. Adapt the next gen OS&#8217;s UX with current core to win some time and slowly changed the core under the hood.</p>
<p>as many mentioned already, unlike Nokia, RIM doesn&#8217;t have any serious partner to depend on. If nokia ends up failling to the bottom, MSFT will just buy it out.</p>
<p>More accurate would be Microsoft tearing down the Windows Phone 7.x boat in order to build the Windows Phone 8 boat, which has a similar foundation as the Windows 8 boat which has existed for the last 25 years.</p>
<p>Oh Satan&#8230;.must you be wrong about about everything. Oh and by the way, close the gates. You have it hot as hell in Ohio.</p>
<p>Coming from Satan&#8230; (next)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree about WP8, but this made me laugh.</p>
<p>I only miss the buring platform, next to the WP8 boat to be clear :P</p>

<p>8 million this quarter + 10 million last quarter is about 18 million. About 10-12 million Windows Phones have been sold since launch in 2010.</p>
<p>You also have to take trends into account. Windows Phone market share is increasing in most countries while Blackberry is dropping rapidly.  Same applies to Symbian.  Symbian might have a lot of market share still, but the rate at which it is losing market share is what matters.</p>
<p>Windows Phone is essentially Windows now and will become even more with each iteration. There is no question about it&#8217;s future or the immediate financial future of Microsoft.</p>
<p>Although RIM market share is decreasing this is mostly in 1st world countries, RIM has a strong hold in a lot of 3rd world countries.</p>
<p>isn&#8217;t that the flag Nokia was running up the pole right before the partnership with MS?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/05/24/android-ios-market-share-q1-2012-blackberry-idc/" target="new">Android, iOS gain share in Q1 as Symbian, BlackBerry plummet</a></p>

<p>Oh that&#8217;s a valid argument.</p>

<p>I think they may be bought soon, possibly as a Research department to a larger and generally more profitable (although that&#8217;s not exactly difficult) company.</p>
<p>TIL that someone from Waterloo was a Waterluvian.</p>
<p>I live in Canada and my banker, and his close associate, advised me to purchase RIM stocks. I had to ask them if they were joking, but they were dead serious&#8230;</p>
<p>(G)RIM</p>
<p>So never?</p>
<p>Basically.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s like they are Nokia but are not giving up on their original plan. This could kill them.</p>
<p>Microsoft would bail Nokia out. RIM doesn&#8217;t have any savior.</p>
<p>Also, Nokia makes good products.</p>
<p>So does RIM. Well they used to at least.</p>
<p>Exactly. Used to.</p>
<p>They still do, it&#8217;s the crap software they cram on said products. ;-) Their hardware is still primo. At least the last one I had was. Even the miserable attempt at taking out the iPhone, the Storm, was extremely well built. It was just terrible software that was plagued with low memory.</p>
<p>Sorry man. The storm was a POS. Hardware and software.</p>
<p>It really was went through them like butter. And the OS was beyond crappy no free apps the paid ones costed well over 2-3 dollars (I know I sound cheap) There was nothing really good about it.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t make a good product unless it has the whole package.</p>
<p>RIM has good hardware, they should partner with Microsoft&#8230;</p>
<p>If only they had got an outside CEO instead of Heins</p>
<p>Canadian like Elop?</p>
<p>I dunno, I really like the look of the bits of BB10 they showed off but it could end up ruining what is quite an innovative company and maybe they could have applied their skills and USP&#8217;s on another platform which another CEO would have been more likely to commit too</p>
<p>Leo Apotheker would have done them right.</p>
<p>lol&#8230;.Apotheker? Joke of the day.</p>
<p>Heins has only been CEO since March. The problem isn&#8217;t the CEO. It&#8217;s the fact that they need to go back in time 5 years and properly respond to the iPhone instead of pretending like it didn&#8217;t exist until wanting to build BB10.</p>
<p>Yup</p>
<p>Too funny. Everyone wants Nokia to pick Android but RIM is in worse situation (no moderm mobile OS) and they still don&#8217;t pick Android.</p>
<p>So its over now right? We can stop talking about RIM?</p>
<p>Some here haven&#8217;t even stopped talking about Palm/webOS</p>
<p>The webOS kool-aid was that good.</p>
<p>webOS was the real deal.</p>
<p>In 2015, Palm will rise from the ashes, you wait and see.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s how the Zombie Apocalypse gets started. The suspense was killing me.</p>
<p>I believe when the remains are cremated it&#8217;s technically a phoenix apocalypse.</p>
<p>Research In Passing.</p>
<p>ha</p>
<p>I prefer (G)RIM. Or Reasearch in (slow) Motion. But to each his own.</p>
<p>Recession In Motion</p>
<p>LOL and RIP are the most appropriate responses here.</p>
<p>another delay, another nail in the coffin</p>
<p>Wow, they turned into Microsoft. The sad thing is by the time it launches they will be so behind that it would be impossible to catch up.</p>
<blockquote> they turned into Microsoft</blockquote>
<p>This confuses me.</p>
<p>Last I checked, Microsoft was the 3rd most valuable company in the world&#8230;</p>
<p>..which is also tirelessly and feverishly working on interesting new products, and who is right on or ahead of their development schedule.</p>
<p>It seems RIM is the complete opposite of all that.</p>
<p>Microsoft: making a profit in the order of $5.7bn, shipping hundreds of millions of software units, got a successful presence in multiple sectors, got some exciting stuff in the pipe RE: Windows Phone 8, Windows 8, Surface, Xbox 720.</p>
<p>RIM: making a loss of $500m, haemmorhaging market share in it&#8217;s only market sector, delayed it&#8217;s only hope until after the iPhone 5 and Windows Phone 8 hardware launches.</p>
<p><img src="http://ic2.pbase.com/g3/21/806321/2/88547458.MSzqTryG.jpg" /></p>
<p>Last time I check, Microsoft hasn&#8217;t delay Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>They just had to kill off the previous version of a phone OS. Again.</p>
<p>volodoscope&#8230;take some time off from the internet pal. Let people forget how dumb this comment is.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll take a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d really love to know how you think they turned into Microsoft.</p>
<p>Where do we send the flowers?</p>
<p>Research In Motion<br />
295 Phillip Street<br />
Waterloo, Ontario<br />
Canada N2L 3W8</p>
<p>wow, we really all should send flowers, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>I imagine, after watching Thorston&#8217;s &#8220;Hello World&#8221; video<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUFwhpcrCTw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUFwhpcrCTw</a>)<br />
 that no one on this message board is that surprised they have underperformed.</p>
<p>Wow.. They are pretty much confident that BB10 releasing in 2013 will take on iPhone 5, Nokia Lumia and Samsung Galaxy devices running iOS6, Windows Phone 8 and Android 4.1 respectively ??  Without an ecosystem and apps, its DOA.</p>
<p>They needed to be launched before this holiday season. This is a death knell for RIM.</p>
<p>HA HA, Die RIM!<br />
I&#8217;m sure some will miss you.<br />
I&#8217;m being nice.</p>
<p>k</p>
<p>ha ha, die rim die<br />
i&#8217;m sure someone will miss you<br />
i am being nice</p>
<p>Ahahahahahahaha</p>
<p>Not gonna lie, I actually laughed out loud when I saw this headline.</p>
<p><img src="http://ymcichem.wikispaces.com/file/view/Hindenburg.gif/173125411/Hindenburg.gif" /></p>
<p>What the fugue?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s depressing&#8230; RIM is the best for us, developers. The best developer support and community I&#8217;ve ever seen. :(</p>
<p><img src="http://play.esea.net/global/media_preview.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.comicvine.com%2Fuploads%2F7%2F75222%2F2072040-not_sure_if_serious.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am serious. I develop for iOS, Android and BlackBerry, and the one I love to develop for is BlackBerry.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know hundreds of developers, maybe only 25-30&#8230; but you are the first I have ever heard say that.</p>
<p>Your sick man.</p>
<p>We have two options here:<br />
1.  Your sentence is a fragment and his sick man needs to do something.<br />
2. You meant to write &#8220;You&#8217;re sick, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your handle&#8230; so fitting&#8230;</p>
<p>*<em>inb4 that&#8217;s what she said</em></p>
<p>It was a trap and now we have your location!</p>
<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>I published a few Android apps to the BB app world, and it was a pain. Dealing with the BB tools, firing up a Playbook emulator, and creating a key to publish to the store was WAY harder when compared to Android and the Play store (haven&#8217;t tried iOS yet).</p>
<p>In Android, you have a single developer key, which you can move around, and a single SDK that does everything from AVDs to low-level platform compilation. In BB, you need to download 4 separate SDKs, link them up somehow, and then create 3-4 keys and then <strong>make sure Jupiter and Saturn are in one straight line</strong>, before compiling and packaging your app.</p>
<p>I could go on and on. If you want a more in-depth comparison,<a href="http://blog.jamiemurai.com/2011/02/you-win-rim/"> this blogger has done a good job of listing all the problems with BB app development</a>, and a comparison to iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know that the process of submitting apps is painful, but the development options for BlackBerry devices (AIR, HTML5, Java) is really great and the support they give to us is really amazing. Of course this is because they were struggling and had to get some attention from developers.</p>
<p>The thing is that they care about us, giving us the options to choose which language we want, not like Apple/Google that only gives us one option that we have to deal with that.</p>
<blockquote>not like Apple/Google that only gives us one option that we have to deal with that.</blockquote>
<p>Nope. On both iOS and Android, you can code in languages that are not Objective-C or Java respectively. You can use <a href="http://xamarin.com/monotouch">MonoTouch for iOS</a> and <a href="http://xamarin.com/monoforandroid">Mono for Android</a> to write apps in C#. You can also write apps in Python on Android, just google it.</p>
<p>Also, in the case of Android,  you can write apps in HTML using the WebKitView, or in C using the NDK. You can also write HTML apps in iOS as far as I know, but since I&#8217;m no iOS dev I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: You CAN write apps in other languages on both iOS and Android.</strong></p>
<p>I always found their developer support was arrogant and unhelpful.  And their tools have always been among the industry worst.  Also, pimping AIR on mobile after even Adobe has given up on mobile Flash is just silly.</p>
<p>Nice try RIM stakeholder</p>
<p>Why? Why So Serious?</p>
<p>Weather you like the platform or not.. Windows phone is the most advanced/productive development platform compared to iOS, Android and Blackberry. Microsoft just gets it when it comes to development tools, sdk&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p>Man you are insane. We are working with all of them and BB is like they are putting needles under your nails!</p>
<p>Final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>BB10 was already going to fail but this is the final nail.</p>
<p>Goodbye RIM, you will soon be purely a services company.</p>
<p>So in other words RIM just committed suicide?</p>
<p>To concur with all, delaying BB10 almost another year out is death for RIM.</p>
<p>Hey, you,  the last guy out of that place: make sure to turn out the lights.</p>
<p>Aaaaannnd done. bye bye rim</p>
<p>Why would you do this?</p>
<p>Everything is going by RIM&#8217;s usual playbook.</p>
<p>Too soon.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Damn, bro.</p>
<p>Checkmate.</p>
<p>Anybody else laugh out load when they read the headline?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yes.  It&#8217;s like a midget telling everyone he will be an NBA player and then tweeting that his training is more difficult than expected but he should make it on the next draft.</p>
<p>I bowed my head in silence for them.</p>
<p>Oh that&#8217;s not good<img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/St%C3%B6wer_Titanic.jpg/220px-St%C3%B6wer_Titanic.jpg" /></p>

<p>Wow&#8230; even the RIM apologists/fanboys have no answer to this one lol.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a bad sign.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure someone will come in with a hilarious story about how this is all part of RIM&#8217;s plan though, and how BB10 is going to reinvent the entire mobile industry and blah blah blah.</p>
<p>It&#8217;ll help lighten the mood for the rest of you living in reality.</p>
<p>But what is there to answer? No delay helps clearly, and competitors have great products&#8230; so what? It&#8217;s not Q4 or Q1 that is going to make a difference. Either they can sell the product and OS or not in the end. I just don&#8217;t grasp the mindless and puerile bashing. Aren&#8217;t you interested in original and different tech and choices? Talk about fanboys.</p>
<p>Well normally you could be relied upon to provide some sort of positive spin &#8211; so the fact that you can&#8217;t bring yourself to is indicative of the depth of their problems.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m supportive of RIM whatever the outcome may be, and I don&#8217;t think my behavior reveals anything. Actually the situation hasn&#8217;t really changed. It&#8217;s late now, it&#8217;ll be late later. The financial results are predictable, the delays aren&#8217;t helping but so be it, and the vultures have been circling for a long time now&#8230;</p>
<p>Hahaha, I knew I&#8217;d find one! That wasn&#8217;t as funny as I was hoping for though.</p>
<p>Trololololol</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;..Q1 of 2013&#8230;.</p>
<p>Is it really going to take that long to find a buyer for RIM and let the new owners decide whether or not to proceed with BB10?</p>
<p>Or is that just how long it will take Thorsten Heins to get his resume polished up?</p>
<p>Move over Palm.  The grave is getting ready to get a little more crowded.</p>
<blockquote>. RIM&#8217;s new OS was supposed to arrive sometime later this year, with the company claiming previously that it needed a &#8220;highly integrated dual-core LTE platform&#8221; which it expected to be available by mid-2012.</blockquote><p>. Snapdragon S4?</p>
<p>The only highly integrated multi-core LTE platform I know of going into mass production in Q4 is ST-Ericsson&#8217;s Cortex-A15 NovaThor SoC. Maybe Snapdragon S4 Pro is also launching at that time?</p>
<p>It feels like they are just buying time until someone just comes out and buys them.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/22663951.jpg" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Now?  Sing now?&#8221; &#8211; Fat Lady</p>
<p>So May 2012 &#8211; 18 months = November 2010.<br />
They started developing BB10 after the iPhone 4 was released.<br />
Way to go RIM, you deserved this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, who?</p>
<p>I guess the question of who will go first, RIM or Nokia has just been answered.</p>
<p>Going by Nokia recently lowering expectations for the rest of the year, and for the foreseeable future, it may well be a photo finish between the two.</p>
<p>RIM definately, MS will hold Nokia up while they transition right through to WP. Im certain Nokia&#8217;s fortunes will start to turn around next year when MS take WP8 and really start gunning people down with it.</p>
<p>Are you sure about that?  Nokia&#8217;s cash burn rate is pretty incredible.  From their previous financial disclosures, they admitted they burned through almost One Billion in a single quarter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how Microsoft feels about pouring untold Billions, quarter after quarter, into Nokia, which could fail anyway.</p>
<p>You show a lack of understanding of Nokia&#8217;s financial situation.  Their burn rate is currently ~$300 million when you factor out one-time expenses due to &#8220;restructuring&#8221; (i.e. having to pay out benefits for people who were laid off).</p>
<p>Nokia is going to have a lot of one-time expenses coming up the next few quarters due to a  dividend payment and paying out one-time benefits for layoffs.</p>
<p>They currently have $5 billion in net cash, 9 billion in total cash.  If you subtract out projected one time expenses due to restructuring and assume the same current burn rate (no wp8 improvement), they would have 20 quarters worth of cash available.</p>
<p>Nokia will at worst become a division of Microsoft, and at best be able to blow everyone away with a multi-core, NFC, HD display Lumia 1000  in the autumn.</p>
<p>RIM doesn&#8217;t have any serious partnerships in industry. It&#8217;s just a collection of patents, services and engineers waiting to be snapped up now.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Nokia will die, they could possibly stop selling smartphones but they will still make low end phones where they still have a considerable market share.<br />
Also I&#8217;ve seen a whole bunch of Lumias here in Sweden, people are talking about them, i think there still is a lot more hope for them then suckberry</p>
<p>Nokia.</p>
<p>God, send them merciful death.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way: WebOS already came too late. And they come years after.</p>
<p>I guess they have plenty of time to throw a new coat of paint on the current OS and release &#8220;Blackberry 8&#8221; and &#8220;Blackberry 9.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fucking hell RIM. I actually like the QNX-based OS on the Playbook. It&#8217;s everything WebOS was supposed to be.</p>
<p>Way to fuck up again.</p>
<p>Its a great product. Great to use, and the OS for the most part is very capable. It was just executed appalingly, and way over price at launch.</p>
<p>Rim should of accepted that they&#8217;d have to sell them at more or lest cost in the first place in order to usurp the iPad, just to gain market traction.</p>
<p><img src="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/956477/laz-300-rail.jpg" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not fair.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>Research in Mourning</p>
<p>I think the only way RIM can recover is if they decide to piggyback off of either Android or Windows Phone. 2013 is simply way too late to reestablish Blackberry as a viable thriving 4th ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is making me curious. What&#8217;s taking them so long and are the executives really that naive? People are moving to other platforms and you&#8217;re not going to win them back.</p>
<p>I have a Bold 9900 now, and I love it.  I love RIM as a company, and BlackBerry as a brand.  However, I can&#8217;t support them if they are going to deliver BB10 until 2013.  By that time Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 will be out, and I will move towards that ecosystem.  I played into Apple&#8217;s ecosystem, and I wasn&#8217;t happy with the productivity of the iPad, but they do have a great ecosystem.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 here I come!</p>
<p>I had a bold 9900, miss it a lot, just can&#8217;t beat that keyboard. Lumia 800 now though ;)</p>
<p>Except for, you know, with just about every touch software keyboard ever.</p>
<p>Nah, the touch keyboard on the Lumia is great and the iphone one is just as good but the physical keyboard of the bold is miles ahead for raw mistake free typing at speed.</p>
<p>Really? Because every speed and accuracy typing competition EVER begs to differ with you.</p>
<p>Lumia 800 &#8211; noch WP8 for you.</p>
<p>They should rename this company to RNIM: Research NOT In Motion</p>
<p>I think Nokia should buy them.</p>
<p>A company in ICU buying a walking corpse?</p>
<p><img src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4c7f9ef87f8b9a0f53f30300-402-301/steve-jobs.jpg" /></p>
<p>the account name is funnier than the response.</p>
<p>Things can&#8217;t get any sadder, when a dead man is mourning the future death of a company.</p>
<p>So, I have to be the lone person to say that this isn&#8217;t the end of RIM?</p>
<p><strong>I really, really, dislike anything blackberry</strong> but come on now, I don&#8217;t think anyone one here was holding their breath for the next RIM device.  They are still selling more than Windows Phone devices right now and for some reason, companies are still handing out their devices.  .</p>
<p>The crazy thing here is that if they do come up with something compelling in 2013, it would be smack in the middle of everyone&#8217;s refresh so there will be people looking for name recognition (seriously).  Long story short, I look for Chapter 11 to be filed as the call of death, not products being pushed back a few months&#8230;</p>
<p>Delaying a product launch is signs of struggle and lack of talent.  Similar writings were on the wall with Palm and webOS.  When I saw this article, I wasn&#8217;t surprised at all.</p>
<p>I agree that this isn&#8217;t the &#8220;final nail&#8221;, but it sure does make everyone want to bet RIM will fail.  I will tell you that the company I work for still hands out RIM products.  Talk is that we will move to a BYOD model in a year or two due to all the complaints and lack of enthusiasm for RIM devices.</p>
<p>I think people are way too enthused to see a company have hard time these days&#8230;especially in the tech industry.</p>
<p>Would it surprise me if in 4 years, there&#8217;s no more RIM (in the sense that we know it now? No. But this isn&#8217;t the end and I don&#8217;t know if this is an indicator that they have a poor talent pool either.  They were intelligent enough to try to manage expectations from now, that&#8217;s a start.</p>
<p>I wonder if this might be different than WebOS though.</p>
<p>WebOS, from everything Ziegler wrote last month, sounded like it just never launched with a fully developed product.  Lackluster physical materials and half-baked OS caused too much disappointment from the beginning.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unlikely they will, but if BB can come out with quality devices on a modern OS, I think they might have a chance.</p>
<p>If BB10 is still behind the Android, iOS, and even WP8 curve, then they need to just stop.</p>
<p>Maybe not in any industry at any time, but in the mobile tech world, right now, delay <strong>is</strong> death.</p>
<p>The number of companies handing out their devices is shrinking.  My husband and I both work for large, national companies who used Blackberries for years and both of the companies we work for moved to Android.  I prefer the Good app to the way it integrated into BB, personally.</p>
<p>Hahahahaha!<br />
Sorry, this is just too unbelievable.  I think it&#8217;s too late for them now.</p>
<p>It honestly doesn&#8217;t matter how great the OS is when it finally comes out. Google and Apple are moving at such fast paces it will take them forever to catch up. I mean lets be realistic. Google and Apple have created such solid ecosystems for their users what is it that a user will even find appealing about Blackberrys?</p>
<p>There was a period of time where this one computer company was on its way to oblivion and most people in the tech industry were counting the days until it went out of business.</p>
<p>Then they released the iMac and the rest is history.  Speculation is nothing more than speculation.  Not saying it&#8217;ll happen, but stranger things&#8230;</p>
<p>it should have said &#8220;delayed until chapter 11&#8221;</p>
<p>THIS JUST IN! RIM to open source BB10! /s</p>
<p>Wow that sucks.I really wanted RIM to make a minor comeback. Unless it completely changes the way we use smartphones, 10 is DOA. Sorry RIM, that&#8217;s the price of arrogance a few years ago.</p>
<p>LOL, I love the RMS Titanic as a related items tag</p>
<p>Does anybody else think they&#8217;re just passing the ball down the line, realizing that by first quarter next year they&#8217;ll be split up and sold off?</p>
<p>Apple dug the RIM&#8217;s grave, Google helped along &amp; MS watched silently with fear.</p>
<p>How many &#8220;beginnings&#8217; of the end&#8221; can one company possibly have? They&#8217;re setting up a &#8216;HP buys RIM then abruptly rage quit all plans to do anything progressive with the technology&#8217; type outro.  If this ain&#8217;t a mess, it&#8217;ll do until the real mess gets here!</p>
<p>why is it taking so long? I thought the playbook was based on the same OS, and thats a ok product at the moment, so how can it take so long to add phone functionality (voice/text) ?</p>
<p>RIM, you have to understand, you <strong>can&#8217;t</strong> do that.</p>
<p>You <strong>can</strong> <strong>not</strong>, that&#8217;s game over, that&#8217;s the absolute end of the road, you&#8217;re crashing you&#8217;re burning but you&#8217;re not dead yet, <strong>that</strong> decision, <strong>that</strong> one right there, <strong>that</strong> is what <strong>will</strong> kill you.</p>
<p>Thorstan, whatever it fucking takes, get that OS shipping and a slick ad campaign running in 2012, that&#8217;s the <strong>only</strong> option.</p>
<p>Agreed. Slip features, not deadlines.</p>
<p>Features like not being able to access your email or calendar from your device? How is another Playbook fiasco going to help RIM?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you pick the features you slip.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t need to spend engineering resources on things which don&#8217;t need to be there. Clearly email and calendar aren&#8217;t in that list.</p>
<p>They really don&#8217;t have much of a choice though, do they?</p>
<p>If there was any possible way they could ship something competitive, believe me, they would.</p>
<p>The fact is, they just can&#8217;t.. there is nothing they can do.. It&#8217;s over for them.</p>
<p>Well, even if it&#8217;s buggy, even if it&#8217;s not feature complete, they <strong>need</strong> to get <strong>something</strong> new out there by the end of 2012, and some slick ads allong with it or it&#8217;s game over, they don&#8217;t have another real choice.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; Amateur hour IS over&#8230;</p>
<p>(sent from my playbook&#8230; Seriously)</p>
<p>Hey, I have an idea! Maybe HP can buy RIM!</p>
<p>//Too soon?</p>
<p>Google puts the G in RIM</p>
<p>Microsoft = <img src="http://gifsoup.com/imager.php?id=3875828&t=o" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://gifsoup.com/" title="GIFSoup" target="_blank">GIFSoup</a>&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even funnier here is that you know he&#8217;s singing/dancing to &#8220;It&#8217;s Not Unusual&#8221;, and to be honest, it&#8217;s really <em>not</em> unusual to see RIM in this situation.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. Apple will have shipped SIX generations of iPhone before BB10 is ready. RIM is hosed.</p>
<p>yeah how fucking slow can you be. seriously. what the hell have they been doing?</p>
<p>Meetings &#8211; lots and lots of meetings.</p>
<p>Coup de grace for RIM. Never liked them, and it makes me happy they&#8217;re now doomed :)</p>
<p>at this point is any of their tech worth buying? some make the argument for buying them solely for BBM, but really?</p>
<p>They do have a pretty vast portfolio of patents that would certainly be useful to&#8230; well, just about anyone, really.</p>
<p>This gets bandied about an awful lot. If their patents are so valuable why aren&#8217;t they earning fat royalties?  It&#8217;s not like they couldn&#8217;t use the money.</p>
<p>Sadly, the next announcement is going to be one of these things:<br />
 Company X buys RIM and says they are going to &#8217;double down&quot;<br />
RIM switches to another platform. <br />
Or sadly, RIM just files for bankruptcy</p>
<p>I suppose this is good news for people shorting RIM&#8217;s stock.</p>
<p>SMDH</p>
<p>You know times are tough when you&#8217;d rather give a RIM job than get one.</p>
<p>Game over. The worst is not the deadline itself , but RIMs inability to ship something that is 2 years too late.  If they can&#8217;t deliver, it&#8217;s time to step aside and fade into oblivion.</p>
<p>Well of course they&#8217;re going to need more time now that they laid off 5000 people.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re screwed. It&#8217;s so sad.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t R.I.M. just die already? Such an embarrassment to us Canadians.</p>
<p>I fully agree, its just so brutal, its time to bow out with the remaining dignity it has.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now vaporware.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the Duke Nukem of hardware. Way to late for the latest installment, and when it does arrive, it will be panned by the critics.</p>
<p>We actually got a memo from our IT department yesterday saying that they are no longer going to be supporting BB devices at years end for corporate email.</p>
<p>Guess it was just too expensive compared to Apple or Android devices.</p>
<p>Do you work at RIM?</p>
<p>ROFL!</p>
<p>Oooh, that&#8217;s gonna hurt them!</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand RIM.</p>
<p>Lets buy QNX and make a completely new software platform from scratch. This is crazy.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t they just take android, make a secure version of it, pull an amazon and make blackberry app world a curated version of the android market with design guidelines for blackberry devices. They could have had a thriving ecosystem now with compelling devices. RIM has never made bad hardware but software is not their strong suit.</p>
<p>Oh and add that sideloading could be blocked by administrators.</p>
<p>Shhh, please don&#8217;t bring intelligent ideas to the table around RIM.  They&#8217;ll have none of it.</p>
<p>Bit of a sad day for us Canadians.</p>
<p>TITANIC IS SINKING! YES ITS SINKING, JUMP SHIP NOW!</p>
<p>Right after Christmas. Yeesh. RIM, go and print out a load of Blackberry Gift vouchers to sell. You might just survive.</p>
<p>Research In Slow Motion.</p>
<p>Sorry no one cares.</p>
<p>RIP RIM. You have know one to blame but yourself.</p>
<p>Who is down for some 49.99 Playbook action? Hopefully the Nexus 7 can arrange this in the near future.</p>
<p>I feel really bad for any BB employees. Morale among their engineers is probably at an all time low&#8230;</p>
<p>Never bought a RIM device and never wanted one. Looking forward to WP8!</p>
<p>the only thing missing is an appearance by Ted McGinley.</p>
<p>Nicely played.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1058.photobucket.com/albums/t419/nitescape21/Presentation1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Haha, look at Steve!</p>
<p>HOW IS STEVE BALLMER A REAL PERSON</p>
<p>As someone who is (still) looking forward to BB 10 and the keyboard model that was already scheduled for Q1 2013, I guess this doesn&#8217;t affect me. However it does suck that RIM wasn&#8217;t able to get BB10 out in time for this year so that people could see it and hopefully buy it.  All this will do is keep the naysayers going (like most of the comments above).  I guess I&#8217;ll keep chugging along with my 9930 until then.</p>
<p>Not if they go bankrupt before that!</p>
<p>I was really hoping RIM would be able to put out BB10 handsets this year, at least then they would have had a fighting chance if they did it right, but waiting 6+ months to put out a phone to compete with WP8, Andorid and iOS isn&#8217;t gonna cut it.</p>
<p>I think they may need three or even four CEOs to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Nope just a time machine</p>
<p>3 RIM CEOs walk into a bar . . .</p>
<p>Leave the bar bankrupt.</p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>Dead on arrival.</p>
<p>Too late.<br />
I could see them releasing a late 2012 device based on BB10, having it be competitive and having a solid holiday season then building off that.</p>
<p>But this is going to be too little too late. <br />
We&#8217;ll see a new iPhone and Nexus device by the years end, WP8 will be out by this time as well<br />
In fact by the time BB10 finally launches people will be talking about the upcoming iPad 4 and Galaxy S4.<br />
This is in every sense of the phrase &#8220;Too little too late&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a real shame too, I&#8217;ve really liked the look of what has been shown on BB10.</p>
<img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2/jtr.jpg" />This company was on top of the world five years ago and now they lose a half a billion. Something smells. Someone&#8217;s taking money out of this company. <img src="http://www.freecouponshop.info/it2fj/fvx.jpg" />
<p>BB is dead&#8230;.i personally think the final blow must have been MS buying Scalado. Seriously, BB cant get just 1 toe in the door. Sux for them. Especially sucks for The Astonishing Tribe, but i trust that they will survive, cuz they are the true geniuses of tomorrow. :)</p>
<p>If I were in RIM&#8217;s position, I would do the same.  Why release a product that doesn&#8217;t have an edge over competition ?  I believe RIM is doing it right this time.  Wait until competitor shows off everything then outdo them ALL .  We need RIM to stay alive so that competition would remain healthy.  Only until RIM throws in the towel, everything NOW is just speculation.  RIM&#8217;s leadership was in turmoil awhile back and have recently restructured the organization.  Please show some support for RIM.</p>
<p>By the time BB10 is released there will be a new Nexus device with Key Lime Pie (or whatever the K version is) and iOS7 will be in the works.  Everyone else is developing mature platforms at a much quicker pace. It&#8217;s a bit confusing as to what is going on with BB10 development.  Either there  developers just suck comparatively or there is some other complication going on.</p>
<p>Why release a product at all, you mean?</p>
<p>Look, RIM&#8217;s MO for the last however many years has been &#8220;crank out a slightly updated version of the same piece of crap hardware over, and over, and over again&#8221; &#8211; seriously, how many curves and bolds have come through in the last 5 years?  Sure, the bold got redesigned in there, but it&#8217;s still more or less the same device (ironically, the &#8220;newest&#8221; bold that has the touch screen and keyboard looks more like the &#8220;original&#8221; bold).</p>
<p>At this point, I honestly don&#8217;t know that delaying or releasing makes much of a difference.  RIM is sinking, and sinking fast, and this won&#8217;t be what kills it: years of lack of true innovation are the nail.  Think about what their roadmap for ths first half of this year was: &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re going to release a curve and a bold&#8230;but they&#8217;ll be in white!&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s not exactly going to thicken their revenue stream.</p>
<p>To quote Sergio, &#8220;We gotta thicken our f-in revenue stream, right f&#8217;n now&#8221; &#8211; that&#8217;s what the people at RIM need to be thinking, because with every passing day they&#8217;re losing market share.  Other companies are starting to catch up in terms of mail delivery (BES is still the best, but mobileiron and mcafee both have services that deliver to iOS/android/win7 devices&#8230;and both have come a LONG way), and in terms of hardware RIM hasn&#8217;t had a damn thing to shout about in a very, VERY long time.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WSzTvKpO4s0/0.jpg" /></p>
<p>Bwah-hahahhahahahahahhaahahahahah!!!!!</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly RIM is a company with no vision for the future, and no strategy or products to respond to what the market wants.  They have blown their lead in the market and waited to late to give customers what they want.  They are a sad pathetic excuse for a company.&#8221;  &#8211; Stephen Elop</p>
<p>It will be launched Q1 of 2013 huh?</p>
<p>Guess the folks running RIM are EXTREME optimists, in thinking they&#8217;ll still be AROUND in the first quarter of 2013.  Let this be proof to any I&#8217;ve argued with in the past: yes, they still have/had a good international business &#8211; no, that&#8217;s not enough to save this &#8220;Titanic&#8221; of a friggin company.</p>
<p>Nooooooooooooooo! /s</p>
<p>&#8220;Attention Gadget Collectors.  Please remember that you need to store your device in its original packaging in order for it to retain maximum value as a collectible curiosity.  We recommend that you vacuum-seal your NIB Blackberry devices in exactly the same way you did with the Microsoft Kin.&#8221;  &#8211; your friends at eBay.</p>
<p><img src="http://androidheadlines.com/images/rim-takes-responsibility-for-australian-wake-up-protest_pstk-_0.jpg" /></p>
<p>It seems like the correct way to go but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;s too little and too late</p>
<p>Ridiculous.</p>
<p>Well its only in Alpha. BB still needs to move forward at an amazing rate, perform flawlessly while still delivering solid devices and hardware&#8230; then they will have a chance. Biggest come back of all mobile time?</p>
<p>And this is just the OS. Let&#8217;s not forget the Ecosystem. Somehow that has to be built up as well. I don&#8217;t see them pulling a (respectable) movie, TV, music, and book store out of thin air by the end of the year (or even next year for that matter).</p>
<p>Even if they can make BB10 stable by November they still have only a 1/4 of the equation. They need good hardware (1/4) and a supporting ecosystem (1/2). Until then they will continue to lose and lose marketshare.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.marco.org" target="new">Marco Arment</a> showed this best: <img src="http://www.marco.org/media/2012/01/rim-ceos-stepping-down.png" /></p>
<p>There is already a native movie service on the play book. It was released with 2.0. Looks just like the play station movie store. Has music as well.</p>
<p>They just stashed on some third-party apps there, with Slacker and all. And, those ecosystems are in their infancy too. They need an ecosystem that integrates with the Playbook, and is actually competitive.</p>
<p>Can I play you in Draw Something?</p>
<p>Note that Draw Something is already losing steam.</p>
<p>Not as fast as the Playbook did.</p>
<p>I prefer to wait until the plane has actually crash landed before making predictions. To wish for a competitor to die before it the OS is released to to also hope that Microsoft got 100% of the desktop OS market share. To not encourage competition is to pray for a winner-take-all end result.</p>
<p><img src="http://allthingsd.com/files/2012/05/1685.png" /></p>
<p>This is genius.</p>
<p>Honestly, the grid layout of iOS got old pretty quick for me.</p>
<p>Do you guys have any ideas for a laptop alarm system that isn&#8217;t entirely software based?</p>
<p>&#8230;Sorry for being completely off topic</p>
<p>It&#8217;d never too late. Technology is always changing and we have no real clear definition of what the smartphone market will look like by the end of the year. Hoopefully there will be a good BB10 device for my upgrade from the Droid incredible 2.</p>
<p>It will be hard though. Look at Nokia&#8217;s struggles in transitioning to Windows Phone. Look at the difficulties Microsoft faces when trying to get Developers on board and they have pretty strong Evangelism Crews and literally armies of developers who know Silverlight and .Net programming in general.<br />
RIM would perhaps have to bring a real game changer to the table and from what I can see up to now they just are not the company to do that.</p>
<p>Not really, they still have more marketshare than windows phone.</p>
<p>Do they have more mindshare?</p>
<p>Depends what you mean by that? Mindshare among TheVerge and Engadget commenters, or mindshare among real people in the real world? Because if it&#8217;s the latter, then yes, it definitely has a lot more mindshare than WP7.</p>
<p>Blackberry as is has more mindshare (negative and positive).   A radically different blackberry OS on the other hand?   Lets not be so hasty on that one.</p>
<p>Here in Trinidad and Tobago my experience has been, yes BlackBerry has more mindshare simply because of the data plans and BBM. However since the non-tecchies have started hearing about the loss of CEOs etc, I&#8217;ve actually heard &#8216;BlackBerry is going to die. I&#8217;m just waiting for something else that as cheap&quot;<br />
-<br />
Guess they&#8217;re going to ignore the iPhone. Yay :D xD</p>
<p>They do. In key markets like India, for example, more people know about BlackBerry than Windows Phone. In fact the Windows Phone mindshare is hopelessly low here even with popular brands like Nokia pimping it.</p>
<p>Same goes for South Africa. Population was estimated to be 52 million people at the end of 2011 and there are (confirmed) 12+ million Blackberries in the country</p>
<p>No kidding! Windows Phone just launched in India a few months ago.</p>
<p>Ahem. <a href="http://youtu.be/h3rAItM0lMw" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/h3rAItM0lMw</a></p>
<p>Undoubtedly yes.</p>
<p>All the BlackBerry users I know love BlackBerry for its keyboard.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why they would buy this.</p>
<p>The ones I know buy it simple because it&#8217;s a BlackBerry. If something like this were to come out they would upgrade in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>So allot of people bought BlackBerry Storm and Storm 2?&#8230;</p>
<p>The ONLY reason BlackBerry is popular among non-corporate folk is keyboard &amp; BBM.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think blackberry will abandon their keyboards, I expect them to release a model with a keyboard.</p>
<p>All the blackberry users I know get their from work, including myself.  No one I&#8217;ve ever heard of actually goes out and gets one for themselves. So does it really matter what design they&#8217;re using?</p>
<p>Well outside of the US a lot people buy their blackberry and a lot of people I know here in US buy theirs so its really just who you are associated with.</p>
<p>I know two guys who get there&#8217;s from work too.. Only difference they are the owner and they bought it and they don&#8217;t have an IT dept. One does real estate and the other does youth sports programs..</p>
<p>From the very article you&#8217;re commenting on, in giant orange letters:<br />
<blockquote>BB10 IS BEING ARCHITECTED SO THAT IT CAN WORK AS A TOUCHSCREEN-ONLY DEVICE/blockquote&gt;</blockquote></p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that RIM won&#8217;t put out a QWERTY model.  I&#8217;m sure they know that a lot of their users/fans, like myself, still want that keyboard.  Based on what I saw in the keynote, BB 10 will work quite nicely with one..</p>
<p>So what? You really think after all these years Blackberry will abandon their keyboard that so many people love and was one of the deal breaker for why some kept a blackberry?</p>
<p>that doesnt mean it WONT work on a device with a keyboard&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great that you looked at the pictures and read the big orange letters, but there&#8217;s an article too. In fact, in the same sentence as your quote they say this:</p>
<blockquote>RIM could throw a curveball and release a device with a physical keyboard at the launch of the OS</blockquote>
<p>PS: &#8220;it can work as&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;it will only works as&#8221;.</p>
<p>what are you even talking about, did u watch their recent commercial where they are bashing touchscreens. 4 smartphone OS can&#8217;t survive, microsoft has more money and resources to be the number 3.</p>
<p>Why exactlly wouldn&#8217;t there be a market for 4 Smartphone OS&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Cool, an ecosystem that has  0 apps and 0 phones right now is still ahead of windows phone? I seriously don&#8217;t get the joy that trolls get in banging out nonsense on a keyboard day after day.</p>
<p>Try upwards of 20k apps.  Anything that works on the Playbook now will work on the BB10 phones.  And given RIM&#8217;s fairly impressive push to recruit new developers, that number stands to be much higher by launch.</p>
<p>Okay, we&#8217;ll take 20k instead of 0. But even then, is ~20k&gt;than ~80k? From what i&#8217;ve read, playbook apps are easily ported from android (lets hope the experience isn&#8217;t as bad as iOS to android ports), but even if it was a quick job, where&#8217;s the install base? <br />
The playbook is even more of a failure than windows phone has been, so what incentive does anyone have to jump onto what will be the 4th place platform and skip over 3rd? Doesn&#8217;t make sense.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s upwards of a couple million Playbooks out there now, and it&#8217;s kickstarting the ecosystem.  Would it have been better with 10 million?  No doubt, but that&#8217;s why they realized they needed to cut the price and get as many Playbooks out there as they could.</p>
<p>The uphill battle that <em>Microsoft </em> is facing is that for a dev it might make much more sense to produce for Android, iOS, <em>and BB10</em> than to code for WP.</p>
<p>Yeah, because if my mental score is up to date, just the lumia series alone in the last 6 months have sold about as many playbooks as RIM has out in the wild, that would be more incentive to go for BB10.<br />
And it makes even less sense after all the demos that MSFT have shown off how a game coded for WP can be ported to XBOX with very little modification of code. Which would go back to the devices in the wild argument again WP+Xbox&gt;Playboy+BB10 phones, and that argument doesn&#8217;t even have the possibility of changing for many years to come considering how many Xboxs are out there. And it&#8217;ll only get worse when W8 launches. <br />
I&#8217;ve made an app for personal use on my own WP, but if i were a developer looking to make money, i would of course go where the money is. But there&#8217;s no way i&#8217;d put RIM at #3 over MSFT right now.</p>
<p>And you have to remember that before Microsoft discontinued Windows Mobile, Windows Mobile had 18% marketshare in the US.</p>
<p>People were saying it was &#8220;too late&#8221; for Apple right before Steve came back and turned everything around. RIM&#8217;s not dead yet.</p>
<p>So, does RIM have an ousted leader who could make a triumphal return, armed with a turnaround technology (a la the original iMac), energize the company, and be a visible, dynamic leader around which the company can rally?</p>
<p>Because if not, I&#8217;m afraid it might be too little too late.</p>
<p>They do.  His name is Thorsten Heins, and he is taller than you.</p>
<p>Also, he as charismatic radical and energizing as boiled fish.</p>
<p>Boiled fish?</p>
<p>Boiled fish.</p>
<p>you start boiling fish and i think they start moving till they cant move no more</p>
<p>For short, I call him Thor. I think that&#8217;s a testament to how he&#8217;ll do.</p>
<p>Not like Steve Jobs</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the iMac that saved Apple. the iMac and iBook merely stabilized Apple but even then Apple wasn&#8217;t really going anywhere.</p>
<p>Balsillie would be the closest equivalent to Jobs and he like Jobs, may have to spend a few years wandering the desert to learn the errors of his ways and come back with a new plan.</p>
<p>Jobs failed in many ways after his initial success and hubris eventually led to his ouster after some failed product launches and erratic behaviour.</p>
<p>It was rumored that he had a plan but the board didn&#8217;t like it.</p>
<p>Could&#8217;ve of been a good one.</p>
<p>Steve jobs didn&#8217;t come back to apple to create more stuff that&#8217;s already out there.</p>
<p>You are comparing steve jobs with Thorsten Heins? Steve was an extraordinary man unlike  this fellow.</p>
<p>RIMs financial situation is a bit stronger than what Apple&#8217;s was at that time.</p>
<p>Which is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>Please ENLIGHTEN me as to how/why it is irrelevant? You EFFING troll.</p>
<p>Because, my capital-letter friend, the financial situation only tells you how long can you last on what you already have and even this is not very precise. Mostly its about how much time is on your death clock. Apple had like 2 months AFAIR, RIM maybe has 2 years.</p>
<p>But. This tells nothing about how your future products will perform, how successful would you convert existing users to the newer platform (see how Nokia struggles with it) nor how you attract users to your new platform.</p>
<p>While it doesn&#8217;t paint the entire picture. It is RELEVANT.</p>
<p>You think Nokia would be doing what they are and taking those risks if they were broke?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Apple did.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>I read this and couldn&#8217;t stop laughing, lol. The sincerity in your anger&#8230; pure gold.</p>
<p>It is very relevant.</p>
<p>Except RIM doesn&#8217;t have a 150 Million dollar investment from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Because RIM have 150 Million Dollars of their own</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s got no debt and about 2.5 bln in the bank.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also making roughly $100mil in EARNINGS per month.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll grant, they&#8217;ve been in a slow, steady decline, and if the only thing you pay attention to is market share, then it looks pretty iffy, but that isn&#8217;t the whole picture.</p>
<p>Subscriber base CONTINUES to grow, and RIM gets a steady income for each and every subscriber.  Despite some high-profile defections (cough HALLIBURTON cough [good-riddance]), corporate handset and infrastructure sales are still beyond Nokia/MS&#8217;s wildest dreams.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got time to turn things around.  And they&#8217;ve already started.</p>
<p>Thorsten Heins has an impressive past record.</p>
<p>hes no jobs</p>
<p>Is Jobs God?</p>
<p>The only reason you and most people laud Jobs is because his return became a success. Now you&#8217;re writing off others who are three months in the job because they haven&#8217;t done what Jobs did in four years</p>
<p>Yeah, and Bill Gates isn&#8217;t a Jobs either. Neither is Wozniak, or Schmidt. Get your head out of the gutter.</p>
<p>again, from Enders Shadow, the sort of &#8220;same story told from a different character&#8221; of the well known <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender's_Game">Enders Game</a> a fantastic book I hope Paul is rereading (try the audiobook version, great baritone narrator)</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;"That no matter how good a commander was, no matter how resourceful, no matter how well-prepared his army, no matter how excellent his lieutenants, no matter how courageous and spirited the fight, victory almost always went to the side with the greater power to inflict damage. <strong>Sometimes David kills Goliath, and people never forget. But there were a lot of little guys Goliath had already mashed into the ground. Nobody sang songs about those fights, because they knew that was the likely outcome. No, that was the inevitable outcome, except for the miracles.</strong><br />
The Buggers wouldn’t know or care how legendary a commander Ender might be to his own men. The human ships wouldn’t have any magical tricks like Bean’s deadline to dazzle the Buggers with, to put them off their stride. Ender knew that. Bean knew that. What if David hadn’t had a sling, a handful of stones, and the time to throw? What good would the excellence of his aim have done him then?"&#8221;</blockquote>

<p>He&#8217;s no Steve Jobs and you know it.  Steve Jobs Thinks Different.</p>
<p>Thought</p>
<p>You just confirmed my theory. Apple connected Steve Jobs brain to iCloud!!!!</p>
<p>They still rely on Air. So, that&#8217;s not a way to go, that&#8217;s a dead end.</p>
<p>No, the new architecture does not &#8220;rely on Air&#8221;.  Still supports it, yes, but the new Cascades framework is native.  As in, baked in.  As in, not needing that resource-sucking translation layer.</p>
<p>This is a decent-looking UI.</p>
<p>yeah. i mean, seriously? come up with cool new features, and give your competitors SEVEN months (min.) of free catchup time? seriously RIM&#8230; I bet the next version of iOS and Android will soon somehow say they &#8220;also&#8221; had the features of BB10 in development.</p>
<p>Why does everyone say too little too late? Believe it or not there are a lot of people who still like their BlackBerries. Besides W8 isn&#8217;t even out either. I can&#8217;t wait till this fall. BRING ON THE COMPETITION! ;)</p>
<p>The fact that you have to insist people &#8220;believe it or not&#8221; says a lot about the current situation.</p>
<p>My reply was to Andre, but that is a long way up at this point lol.  Is there current situation bad, yes. Is it bad enough to drive them out of business (like a lot of people are claiming), only time will tell after the release of BB10.  I&#8217;m not a BB fanboy or any fanboy for that matter.  However, when I do buy my products I always like to see different options available to me.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s still time for RIM to pick up the ball that Microsoft dropped and be the third major platform owner.</p>
<p>Definitely. As an iPhone 4S user (and previously Galaxy Nexus and Incredible S before that), I would definitely consider a Blackberry 10 device. Make sure you have a high resolution display and a strong camera sensor and I&#8217;m on board.</p>
<p>People need to stop claiming that mobile OSes are &#8220;too late,&#8221; they said it about Windows Phone, Blackberry&#8230;people doubted Android, people even doubted the iPhone. Oh how memories fade so quickly. Mobile OSes are incredibly young, Gmail came into a nearly 20 year old email market and is now very dominant. Compaq used to own the PC space, now they don&#8217;t even exist (bought by HP.) People said IBM was done after Microsoft, they changed their business model and they are bigger than ever. You never know what the market is going to accept or reject&#8230;snow claiming things are &#8220;too late&#8221; to the party&#8230;for all we know, maybe some people are too early. The party is just getting started.</p>
<p>People never called Android or iPhone &#8220;too little, too late.&#8221; Not ever.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not true, in 2008 (2 years after the iPhone was released) :<br />
<a href="http://crackberry.com/top-10-reasons-why-iphone-no-blackberry" target="new">http://crackberry.com/top-10-reasons-why-iphone-no-blackberry</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;.. Sure the iPhone SDK has been released, and there might be some great apps in the works, but in my opinion, that’s too little, too late, as they say.&#8221;</blockquote></p>
<p>A colossal moron.</p>
<p>Its never too late, the only question is whether they have enough money to keep going till things pick up.</p>
<p>It will be a pretty hard way ahead of them. Microsoft is struggling with developer support and they have quite a lot of manpower in evangelizing people to their technologies. If currently everything really is about Apps this is a pretty bad starting point for BB10 so it will be quite a fight unless they bring something really revolutionary along (like the all touch paradigm of the iPhone was back at launch).</p>
<p>The big difference being that Microsoft will have to work harder to win over Android and iOS developers.</p>
<p>An awful lot of apps from these platforms port over to BB10 with minimal effort, but for WP they&#8217;d have to be heavily re-coded.</p>
<p>Not to mention the immense developer support by RIM at this point. Free development devices, support for a huge amount of code, and an active push for App World success.</p>
<p>RIM has a tremendous amount of work cut out for them. When Apple came out with the iPhone, 5 years ago, they had all the interface elements figured out from tab bars, on and off switches (which RIM seems to be ripping off), segmented control bars &#8211; Everything. Looking at the video above, RIM doesn&#8217;t seem to have any set of guidelines for what apps should look like. Everything is kind of just floating there.</p>
<p>Looks good but it&#8217;s too late now. Sorry RIM.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that it is.  They still have lots of corporate accounts that are very risk-averse.  There are no obvious alternatives in terms of locked-down corporate devices.  It&#8217;s probably not too late for them as a company.  But they do need to fix the developer experience.</p>
<p>iOS making big-time inroads into corporate use.</p>
<p>And between iPhones and BB10 Blackberries a large chunk of those &#8220;very risk-averese&#8221; corporate guys will get iPhones.  Even some of them are bright enough to figure out that BB10 is untested, bleeding edge technology, related by bane only to BB 7 or earlier.</p>
<p>Maybe for US but people in other countries still like blackberry</p>
<p>They said the same thing about Nokia.</p>
<p>Dwindling rapidly also. I think the only proper place that loves is still is Jakarta and that might be more of an infrastructure issue that&#8217;s driving it than not.</p>
<p>Ya US thinks everything that happens in the US happens in the rest of the world also, most analysis done in the US is based on the trends in the US and not worldwide.</p>
<p>love how you haven&#8217;t seen the OS run and this is a developer reference handset and you still draw conclusions.</p>
<p>This is the Internet Sir, it&#8217;s what we do.</p>
<p>Carry on.</p>
<p>Yep, RIM should have been doing this back in 2008 &amp; 2009. They took way too long.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too late for them to save you but that&#8217;s alright. I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be able to save a few other million people&#8230; or so&#8230;</p>
<p>Too late. Also the botom menu looks like it got Samsung&#8217;d from Symbian Belle.</p>
<p>I like your use &#8220;Samsung&#8217;d&#8221; instead of &#8220;copied&#8221;</p>
<p>SO beautiful. Wow.</p>
<p>/s ?</p>
<p>No /sincere</p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re amish right&#8230;?</p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re an asshole, right?</p>
<p>canttellifserious.jpg</p>
<p>Device + ICS = something I would love.</p>
<p>any device + ICS = something everybody would love.</p>
<p>Idk about you but I would like more than 2 operating systems in the smartphone market.</p>
<p>As do I, but BB wont be it. If anything, it will be WP7, and thats a HUGE if. (Coming from someone who uses a WP7 device)</p>
<p>BB has more current market share than WP7 so it confuses me how a company that has more market share won&#8217;t do as well if not better than WP7.</p>
<p>How well did Windows Mobile market share translate over into WP7 market share? Not very well if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>Exactly. Windows Mobile has a 18% marketshare when Microsoft abandoned it in favor of Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Really beautiful. But, it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>You know, you COULD wait and let the market make that decision&#8230;</p>
<p>I really wanted to go to this conference just to get the free phone but they just had to hold it in the USA.. :(</p>
<p>Me too! as a developer i hope that can send them out to us :)</p>
<p>RIM, it is my opinion, and maybe I&#8217;m the only one who thinks this, crazy as I am, that it is just too late.</p>
<p>whats the barcode in the bottom of the screen? looks nice.</p>
<p>I think they should keep it&#8230; gives it a very 007 feel</p>
<p>Its meant for ID, incase someone trys to sell it etc.</p>
<p>Its a dev phone get over yourself.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the playbook 1024&#215;600?</p>
<p>Exactly &#8211; it&#8217;s identical to the Kindle Fire&#8230;</p>
<p>Looks like the articles been updated</p>
<p>Yes, you are absolutelly right</p>
<p>Yeah, Playbook is definitely 1024&#215;600 like most 7&quot; tabs were.  Maybe Dieter meant aspect ratio was the same? <a href="http://m.blackberry.com/us/en/playbook-specs.html" target="_blank">http://m.blackberry.com/us/en/playbook-specs.html</a></p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;.if found that article kinda weird<br />
<blockquote>It has the same industrial design, the same hardware buttons, and a similar screen resolution: 1280 &#215; 768 (the PlayBook is slightly lower at 1024 &#215; 600)</blockquote><br />
then down a few lines&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>RIM has been very clear that developers need to see what their apps look like on a smaller screen, and the fact that this has the identical resolution to the PlayBook leads us to believe that the first BB10 phones will have 1280 &#215; 768 screens.</blockquote><br />
wait what?</p>
<p>Fixed.</p>
<p>BB and stupid BIS &#8230;</p>
<p>Ahh&#8230; I remember those days. Hated them with a passion but I remember</p>
<p>Did anybody say &#8220;too late&#8221; yet?</p>
<p>Look up.</p>
<p>right over your head&#8230;</p>
<p>Too late in saying, &#8220;too late.&#8221; :D</p>
<p>There is no way. BLACKBERRY is topping out Microsoft and Nokia for that 3rd eco system.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; at least their BB OS 10 phones will have a higher resolution than WP7, lol.</p>
<p>at the same time wp8 will be out&#8230; come on now use your head</p>
<p><strong>Claps</strong></p>
<p>You haz it?</p>
<p>Dunno, MS has pockets that never seem to end.</p>
<p>Corrected:</p>
<p>There is no way BLACKBERRY is topping out Microsoft and Nokia for that 3rd ecosystem.</p>
<p>At the end of the day Blackberry has more market share than MS thus ecosystem is pretty irrelevant if you don&#8217;t have the market share.</p>
<p>Blackberry marketshare is declining fast.</p>
<p>Windows Phone + Windows Mobile marketshare may be  small, but it seems to bottom out.</p>
<p>Yeh, no way! Nokia are on fire at the moment with their Windows Phones!<br />
 <br />
Oh wait..</p>
<p>Then why can&#8217;t we accept a fourth ecosystem?</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom on that would run something along the lines of: &#8220;how many platforms do you expect developers to support, exactly?&#8221;</p>
<p>BB10 does enjoy an advantage over WP there, though, because iOS and Android port over slick as goose poop.  A game developer demo&#8217;d an iOS port at BBW a couple of days ago, and moved a native iOS game to BB10 in minutes.</p>
<p>A great many Android executables run just fine on the Playbook with a simple conversion pass.  And I know there are developers who are actually making more money with their converted Android apps in the BB ecosystem than they&#8217;re making in Androidland.</p>
<p>So, portability may just be a big selling point for devs here.  And devs are king right now.</p>
<p>So now the BlackBerry App World is going to be flooded with sloppy ports from Android.</p>
<p>Why not just buy an Android phone then?</p>
<p>Fair question, because the truth is there IS a lot of crap that&#8217;s been ported over.</p>
<p>QNX is supposed to be more secure than Android, though, and when you combine it with the Cascades UI there&#8217;s some differentiation.  If they went with Android they&#8217;d just be another small piece in a rather large pie.</p>
<p>They should shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders.</p>
<p>Were you looking for this: <a href="http://www.dell.com" target="_blank">www.dell.com</a></p>
<p>Great looking device for an alpha dev phone. Looks a tad better than iPhone imo.</p>
<p>Dude&#8230;</p>
<p>Bro&#8230;</p>
<p>Homie&#8230;</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Bro&#8230;</p>
<p>Never understood this. There&#8217;s so many people who thought/think Windows phone is going to take over the industry, however its too late for RIM who is still holding onto marketshare to do the same thing?</p>
<p>Makes zero sense especially when you consider they&#8217;re doing everything right to make it as easy as possible to port your apps over.</p>
<p>It maybe unfair to RIM but it makes a lot of sense. Simply put, Microsoft can keep throwing money at mobile since they have a ton of cash and they make money off their other businesses. RIM doesn&#8217;t have such luxury. If their phone stops selling, they have no where else to go and their cash reserve is tiny relative to Microsoft&#8217;s. Palm and WebOS has shown that even a very good product can die if the company cannot sustain the push behind it.</p>
<p>Yes, but MS makes their money somewhere else.  They aren&#8217;t sincere with mobile.</p>
<p>Think about it, they made tablets before ipad, had a portal before google, had games for windows before Valve&#8217;s Steam, had WM before RIM and iphone.  It doesn&#8217;t matter, because they&#8217;re not all-in, they can always be bullied off the table.</p>
<p>Life is poker, not Starcraft.</p>
<blockquote>had games for windows before Valve’s Steam</blockquote>
<p>Nope, Steam debuted in 2003, while Games For Windows &#8211; Live launched four years later.</p>
<p>They also had an anti-trust settlement.</p>
<blockquote>It doesn’t matter, because they’re not all-in, they can always be bullied off the table.<br />
<br />
Life is poker, not Starcraft.</blockquote>
<p>RIM does have an advantage in the more established mobile consumers, but it seems a bit far fetched to think RIM can hang with Microsoft in poker. Using the poker analogy, Microsoft&#8217;s can hedge their bet and still easily match RIM&#8217;s all-in since they have much more resource and cash. They can sink literally billions into it just as they did with XBox where they lost billions before it turned around.</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t sincere with mobile? So why did they put so much Time, effort, R&amp;D into making the UX and UI so darn pleasant and smooth? I think you meant Google as they recently said that mobile&#8217;s not important for them</p>
<p>Really google said that? Really? Right you love fud</p>
<p>Actually, Google said Android is not critical.</p>
<p>Was not critical at the time &#8211; which is a quote from the Google trial. They also tried to downplay it&#8217;s importance as if they lose the suit that might save them quite some money if it&#8217;s not seen as too important.</p>
<p>&#8220;They aren’t sincere with mobile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Correction:<br />
They weren&#8217;t sincere with mobile, when it was caled Windows Mobile. THe Mobile Market is the Market of the future and guess what, MS knows that too. They&#8217;ll throw money in this sector &#8211; doesnt matter where it comes from &#8211; to be successfull and i bet my iPhone, my girlfriend and my balls that they&#8217;ll be the third ecosystem in 2014.<br />
In case you wanna take that bet: My girl is a hottie, the cell is an iPhone 4 and my balls are fully functional and depending on yours, maybe you can show off a bit with them.</p>
<p>Niveau just hit rock bottom.<br />
All in.</p>
<p>^ This</p>
<p>They may have made a half hearted attempt in the past with Windows Mobile, and just forking Windows onto a laptop turned inside out, but they have changed.  The tablets and phones they make (or will make) are nothing like the products of before.  They are approaching it from a different perspective.  It&#8217;s not &#8220;lets just take windows and put it on a smaller screen&#8221; anymore.  They have made many changes as the most basic levels.</p>
<p>WP7 might be struggling now, but people know they made an effort to make the phone the way people use it.  They are adapting the phone to how people interact, instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft knows they have to be all-in on W8, and make it work in mobile.  The market is shifting, and they need to stay ahead.  RIM is what happens when the market shifts, and you don&#8217;t.  Can the recover?  Time will tell.  Microsoft is being proactive, by shutting down Windows Mobile 7, and building Windows Phone 7 from the ground up.  They lost time, but they are making up for it.  RIM can do the same thing, but they are further behind.</p>
<p>I would love to see a BlackBerry that isn&#8217;t terrible to use.  I would love to see innivation from RIM again.  Competition is good for everyone.  The BB10 previews look great, but making a good looking OS is only half the battle.</p>
<p>There making the phone for how people react? Not a lot of people even use windows phone so obviously that&#8217;s not true&#8230;.if that was the case people would buy the phone were not seeing that happen</p>
<p>They are designing the phone based on how people use their smart phones. The whole &#8220;smoked by windows phone&#8221; campaign is designed to show that. The term I have heard being used is design around usage paradigms.</p>
<p>WP7 also isn&#8217;t going to save Nokia, and Samsung and HTC have already stopped caring. They might actually be more interested in licensing BB10 and go into enterprise at this point.</p>
<p>this is the least possible scenario but i give it a 0.5% chance. Would be interesting.</p>
<p>And you get this &#8220;information&#8221; from where?</p>
<p>What kind of argument are you trying to make? RIM has enough cash. They reported a billion and a half the last quarter. That&#8217;s up 400 million the quarter before it.</p>
<p>I agree with many who say this is their last chance to make a comeback. That&#8217;s a correct sentiment, but to say RIM doesn&#8217;t have enough cash to make the launch of their new devices is ignorant.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re actually just looking for something so stupid to complain about. It&#8217;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft has a lot of cash. They will keep throwing it at their products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, they&#8217;ll keep doing that and people will continue to not buy them.</p>
<blockquote>What kind of argument are you trying to make? </blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m simply explaining why many people do not give RIM the same chance they give Microsoft. It&#8217;s not because RIM is better or worse than Microsoft. It&#8217;s simply that Microsoft has a huge margin of error where as RIM&#8217;s is much much smaller.</p>
<blockquote> to say RIM doesn’t have enough cash to make the launch of their new devices is ignorant.</blockquote>
<p>Except that&#8217;s not what I said at all. I said Microsoft has so much bigger financial power in comparison to RIM and that&#8217;s why people give Microsoft more chances. RIM might or might not succeed with the BB 10 launch but none of things I&#8217;ve said is related to that.</p>
<p>Well i would agree with that if Windows Phone marketshre wasn&#8217;t seeing increases (though modest) in marketshare.</p>
<p>Its amazing how short sighted some people are.   I&#8217;m not guaranteeing success but why do people think they will never grab 3rd place in the market?</p>
<p>To be fair, Palm-HP couldn&#8217;t figure a way to make desirable hardware. Stuck on slow hardware  and wasted time+resources on small devices.</p>
<p>You wanna talk about a company that wasn&#8217;t &#8220;sincere about mobile&#8221;, it was HP&#8230;</p>
<p>Just sayin&#8217;</p>
<p>The market share that RIM hasn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t/won&#8217;t be in bb10 hardware, it will be in legacy devices. There&#8217;s a huge difference between having a built up install base for a BB6 or even a BB7 device vs BB10.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be like adding all the old treo devices into palms market share when they had the Pre out. Sure you could do it, but it doesn&#8217;t help at all since they&#8217;re two completely forked platforms.</p>
<p>Nokia was global leader in Smartphones 2 years ago and the biggest mobile phone manufacturer in the world until recently. Therefore it&#8217;s safe to assume that current market share doesn&#8217;t help you if your burning nearly all bridges and depart for a new land.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this what i just said, but with different words&#8230;</p>
<p>You know what? I&#8217;m keeping an open mind. This looks awesome &#8211; especially the time machine camera.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with you.  I don&#8217;t see what the harm is to being open to established brand names trying to reinvent themselves.  People are just asshats on here from time to time.</p>
<p>This actually looks very good, I&#8217;m impressed.</p>
<p>What is the barcode looking thing at the bottom? Button?</p>
<p>Probably just a barcode for inventory purposes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a developer alpha device, not intended for public consumption.  Barcode is likely a very conspicuous reminder to devs that if they decide to flip the device on eBay, RIM will know.  And remember.</p>
<p>I said &#8220;whoa&#8221; when I read about the timeline camera feature. But that&#8217;s it. I fear that unless RIM introduces something completely new with this OS that really gets the public to stop and take notice, it&#8217;ll be a couple of hard, long years for it before it eventually shutters its doors.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really interested in seeing how long it will take for other platforms to implement this. Hardware should be able to support it already. If I look at the burst camera mode on my HTC Titan it would only come down to adding a dial an only storing the one selected image instead of all of them to the picture gallery.</p>
<p>&gt; &#8220;it&#8217;s not a phone that will ever be released&#8221;</p>
<p>That is unfortunate,  just from the pictures it looks sexy as hell. A lot better looking than the Storm(?) and the Torch.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a shame the best looking, and first new design in a decade, device won&#8217;t be released.</p>
<p>&#8230;it might be &#8220;new&#8221; for Blackberry, but that design looks very similar to Android handsets and even a bit dated compared to them. It&#8217;s nothing new, and hardly innovative. It&#8217;s a black slab.</p>
<p>Totally agree. Its sad that if this was running WP7 or Android, the hardward would be a yawn. But, compared to RIMs current line up this design is forward, controversial, and exciting.</p>
<p>Yeah! Its toooooo late!</p>
<p>Rim it took you 5 years and thousands of dollars to develop this an alpha dev preview, the least you could have done is to release a full version by this time&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s unfortunate that they probably won&#8217;t release a version of that form factor (although I don&#8217;t see why not?), I like it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly intrigued by what Blackberry 10 will bring but my goodness they&#8217;re taking their sweet time with it.</p>
<blockquote>even the same screen resolution: 1280 &#215; 768</blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t the PlayBook feature a resolution of 1024 &#215; 600 pixels?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s been half fixed in the article.</p>
<p>So this doesn&#8217;t even run an alpha version of BB10?  It&#8217;s just a shrunken playbook.  How long has BB10 been in the works for?  How can they expect devs to jump on board when they can&#8217;t even get a functional version of the OS out for testing?</p>
<p> Why RIM can&#8217;t transfer their BB Bold design aesthetic to a slate device is&#8230;. puzzling.</p>
<p>The playbook is fucking ugly.. now it most likely has a counterpart that looks like an iPhone 4???</p>
<p>You know, I have to say, this is FAR better than I had expected out of RIM, its essentially an iPhone 4 front design (its VERY close indeed), with a bumper around it, with a 720 screen, which for some reason blows me away, &quot;wow, RIM actually did a good jo&#8230;.well, this future device which will no doubt be coming out in &#8220;five years time&#8221; actually has the same screen resolution as the half year old Galaxy Nexus sitting beside my bed right now&#8230;.&quot;  :-)</p>
<p>I know 720 is expected now from a smartphone, and that this thing is in &#8220;alpha&#8221; state, ie still months and months and months and months away from being any kind of real product, but its actually pretty good <strong>for RIM</strong> that they managed to get this thing out there in prototype form.</p>
<p>Still, a 720 resolution iPhone 4, running some absolutely <strong>FOURTH</strong> place OS, way behind even Windows Phone, and thats <strong>after</strong> it comes out in ~X months time, with iPhones selling at a rate of ten million each and every month, while BB10 starts from zero?  Doomed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s cheating to call the Galaxy Nexus&#8217;s display truly 720p. In terms of subpixels, it&#8217;s nowhere close. Actual 720p displays (i.e. without resorting to the PenTile matrix) on a phone, and on a smaller (4.2-inch) one no less, is a HUGE leap from the Galaxy Nexus, which only has the same number of subpixels as the iPhone 4 over a surface area &gt;1&quot; bigger. Not much of a technical feat by Samsung, if you ask me. So, bravo to RIM.</p>
<p>If RIM continues to pump out this type of cutting edge hardware and make some actually good software, they have a chance yet.</p>
<p>I dont like the screen quality of my Galaxy Nexus at all, but given that it was &#8220;the first 720 screen to market&#8221; about half a year ago, thats a damn lot better than showing some &#8220;alpha&#8221; device that will <strong>never actually get the new BB10 OS</strong> running a screen of the same resolution in an iPhone 4 prototype mule body, after years of promising &#8220;dual core is needed, a new chip that will lead the industry&#8221; and &#8220;superapps&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad they are trying hard.  It could actually work.  Some of their ideas seem pretty nice.  We shall see, we shall see.</p>
<p>So what RIM has done, was creating a device that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike a blackberry OS10 device, and accompanied by an OS that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike BB OS10?<br />
so that devs can create software that will never run on a BB10 device?</p>
<p>This is so ridiculous, it just might work!</p>
<p>If they keep the price down, I do believe that they can survive. Alot of people I know like BlackBerry because of the data plans and if these kinds of devices are paired with the plans of yesteryear, I know that they will keep breathing in some countries.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t qwerty keyboards BlackBerry&#8217;s biggest selling point?</p>
<p>Nope BBM is their biggest selling point.</p>
<p>QWERTY&#8217;s coming shortly after the full-touchscreen device.</p>
<p>The only reason I have a Blackberry (and it&#8217;s as my secondary device) is because it has the best keyboard available on a smartphone. And then some genius decides to follow the crowd and give that up. So what they&#8217;re actually saying is that I don&#8217;t need a Blackberry any more.</p>
<p>There is a keyboard BB10 device on the horizon.  RIM is first putting out the touchscreen only model to try and draw people in.</p>
<p>looks better than WP7 &#8230; could be the 3rd ecosystem carriers are looking for.</p>
<p>I LOL&#8217;D at looks better than WP7, maybe better than ICS but never WP7. There is no ecosystem btw especially the way people like to refer to WP having none.</p>
<p>Not fact&#8230;.its an opinion stop spreading fud</p>
<p>You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>You have only seen three demonstrations and you are already saying it&#8217;s better.</p>
<p>I have never had BB, but this time I&#8217;ll consider it. Looks too damn good.</p>
<p>Like what I see. Think they&#8217;re on the right path. Let&#8217;s see what they bring actually. I remember being excited about Playbook when they announced but they were too late. Hopefully it&#8217;s not the same now.</p>
<p>looks better than Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>How do you know you&#8217;re doing something good and your design is the leading one? Comments like the above. Everyone hates the fact that WP7&#8217;s interface is just untouchable so every new interface is suddenly better :)</p>
<p>How do you know you’re off into the weeds and your design is broken? Comments like the above. Everyone hates the fact that WP7’s interface is just untouchable so every new interface is suddenly better :)</p>
<p>Okay Mr. Pro designer tell us how the design is broken- Everyone hates it? I don&#8217;t, I bet a lot of people here and those using it don&#8217;t hate it either. By saying untouchable I mean unmatched in terms of freshness, originality, fluidity etc.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t hate it either</p>
<p>The only way BB10 would work is if it were a skin for Android 4.0.</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>very nice hands.  must moisturize?</p>
<p>I just had a Buffalo Bob flashback.</p>
<p>Most BB users I know:<br />
1.  were given phone free by company<br />
2.  like the physical keyboard<br />
3.  Only email and message<br />
4.  hardly ever browse the web<br />
5.  take some photos here and there<br />
6  often carry a second personal phone, like an iPhone</p>
<p>If BB can keep this same demographic as their clients, it will work.  But I don&#8217;t see anyone paying for this on their own.  After all, it&#8217;s about ecosystems and not just the OS anymore</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand why some people seem to want RIM and Blackberry to go away. Everyone in the world knows that Blackberry is late to the party but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should root against them! It should just give you more reasons to want them to succeed. Think of what could happen in mobile if Apple, Google, Microsoft, and RIM all had legitimate claims to making the best smartphone on the planet and they were forced to consistently innovate to stay alive! If Blackberry gets back in the game and Microsoft raises theirs to the level they are capable by the end of the year, mobile technology is about to get really exciting.</p>
<p>Finally someone who sees it the same way I do. I love my Android devices BUT&#8230; I want Blackberry to come back strong for one reason. Corporate Accounts, I am sick and tired of trying to get non tech savy people to use Android and iPhones. If Blackberry were to come back we would have a unified work cell phone again but with modern technology! (well some what unified) It would be soo much easier to manage 50 Blackberry&#8217;s then 20 Android,  15 iPhones, 5 WP7 and 10 whatever phones.</p>
<p>Dear Blackberry,</p>
<p>please come back and make a legitimate phone!</p>
<p>Love,<br />
your secret admirer</p>
<p>And even if everyone didn&#8217;t switch over to BB it would finally force the others to try to win corporate accounts on real merits other than &#8220;no one wants to use a Blackberry because they suck&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>BTW my first smartphone was a Blackberry Bold 9000, it was state of the art at it&#8217;s time and I chose it over an iPhone 3G even though I didn&#8217;t need it for business reasons, in my opinion it was a better phone. RIM has done it before, and hopefully they will do it again.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the thing.with bb 10 it will be.just as confusing as android or iphone</p>
<p>BB was my first smartphone lol a Curve 8310.  It got stolen at a bar and after I upgraded to a Bold 9970, and then a Torch 9810, I have to be honest, I&#8217;ve loved every single one that <strong>I bought</strong>.  They make great phones for people who don&#8217;t constantly need to be entertained (children).  All this ecosystem talk is great, and it certainly adds value, but if you stripped away all the apps and junk that people are so obsessed with, a whole new (forgotten?) respect for BB would be realized.</p>
<p>And by that last sentence I mean solid hardware and total ease of use with the essential &#8220;phone&#8221; things.</p>
<p>I hope this does well. I honestly think they have a better chance at being #3 than WP.</p>
<p>Looks like an iPhone 4&#8230;</p>
<p>Gizmodo summed it up very well (for once): A good start with no finish line.</p>
<p>blackberry is not  going anywhere. go to Canada, India, Philippines etc.. if you dont have bbm you  basically a social outcast . win7 is nice but i wont replace bb as #3 anytime soon if ever.</p>
<p>Have you seen how fast BlackBerry marketshare is dropping? And this is supposed to only come out later this year, with Windows Phone 8, iPhone 5&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, Windows Phone 7 marketplace already has more apps than App World. BlackBerry is also falling behind there&#8230;</p>
<p>Have you seen how fast windows market share is growing?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a volatile, rapidly-growing market.  Market share now might not mean all that much in two years (note, Apple&#8217;s App Store is seeing alarming declines in revenue right now).</p>
<p>There may well be room for another solid platform.</p>
<p>is <strong>architected</strong> a word? If not it is now as the Verge has published it!</p>
<p>Yes it is</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.oup.com/2008/07/architect/">The OED provides citations from as far back as 1813, quoting a letter from Keats, in which he writes <em>&#8216;This was architected thus By the great Oceanus.&#8217;</em></a></p>
<p>I just get sick of the easy &#8220;too little, too late&#8221; or any other combination finishing with &#8220;too late&#8221;. <br />
Too late for what ? where is the finish line ? What is the finish line ? <br />
The way people here think is that everyone should just give up, Google should have just let Apple win, Microsoft should just leave Apple and Google win&#8230; Now Blackberry should just lay down and die without trying. There is no finish line, only a fool would &#8220;know&#8221; what phone he will have in 2 years or 6 months or whatever (We like buying tech&#8230; That&#8217;s why we are on this site !)<br />
It&#8217;s like you guys don&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s not a race, it&#8217;s just a long road&#8230; There is no finish line. The best example is Microsoft who was the all around heavyweight of smartphones for a few years. Now look where they are.. Fighting for marketshare like a scrappy little new comer.</p>
<p>I love seeing these companies battle it out like this&#8230; I don&#8217;t care about being a fanboy or whatever and I probably have more fun with my tech than most of the narrow minded fanboys : Bought a iPhone 3G when it was by far the best phone out there, switched for a HTC Desire a year after, using a Lumia 800 these days and loving it. The better each platform get, the more it&#8217;s competition have to make us want to buy them. It&#8217;s a win/win for us.</p>
<p>TL;DR : Stop bitching about BB10 being late&#8230; It&#8217;s not a race. Maybe when it comes out it will be so awesome that buying any other phone will be stupid</p>
<p>Okay, I know BlackBerry isn&#8217;t what it used to be; it happens. But I live in Waterloo, Canada near the RIM headquarters and I can tell you BlackBerrys are still very much alive. Literally, every other person has a BB, the rest; iPhones. They&#8217;re especially popular among girls becasue they like BBM and the physical keyboard. I know its not the U.S., but they remain one of the fastest growing companies in Canada, despite their poor marketshare.</p>
<p>You live in Waterloo wth do you expect? That&#8217;s like saying I went to google and they all had androids&#8230;</p>
<p>You failed to read the part about how everyone else still has iPhones (even myself) and the part that despite being &#8220;dying company&#8221; according to people who know nothing about the company, they&#8217;re actually one of the fastest growing companies is Canada. Lastly, how about being a <em>tad</em> more respectful next time? You added nothing to the conversation.</p>
<p>Looks like smaller Kindle Fire.</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t believe that they didn&#8217;t even have a functional version of BB10  ready for this. That is just crazy and will not make the inverters feel too confident about BB10&#8217;s progress.   WP7 was lacking some major features when it was announced but at least it was running the actual OS and not a scaled down version of another OS. We will need to wait and see for sure but I have my doubts that BB10 will be out by the end of the year and if that ends up being the case, they are likely to screwed.</p>
<p>*investors</p>
<p>and remove the &#8220;to&#8221; before screwed lol</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an Alpha. Developer devices usually aren&#8217;t finalized software or hardware.</p>
<p>Most often they&#8217;re in Beta though and have most of the functionality in place.</p>
<p>But I guess the main reason to bring the devices in their current state is to not give to much away on things they&#8217;ve got planned further down the road. Keyboard and Camera where needed by developers but many other thing&#8217;s are not (navigation, etc.) so not having dialer, etc. might be due to that.</p>
<p>Any technology business is cyclical and device cycles are only about 1 to 2 years for most consumers. It&#8217;s easy to underestimate the BB brand world-wide. If RIM executes on time and the software works and devs start to support it, RIM may defy the odds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to lose perspective.  Any cursory look back at technology history shows that hegemonies don&#8217;t last. It is fairly certain that in 10 to 20 years, Apple will not be a player in mobile.  Future dominant players don&#8217;t even exist yet.</p>
<p>RIM really needed to show a prototype device today and they didn&#8217;t that<br />
suggests they&#8217;re rather far behind and imo the chances of a BBX device<br />
this year are likely to be slim or insanely limited</p>
<p>that explains why their shares took a bit of a hit today<br />
 </p>
<p>what a shame as BBX looks great, hopefully BBX will still have an impact a year from now when we finally see devices</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather they not make a list of features a long time before its release (like WP Mango) and have the rest of the competition copy their features. They need to surprise the market, so I&#8217;ll wait until then.</p>
<p>no flash on mobile, no physical keyboard, html5 is next, &#8230; boy, where do I heard all this before? Google? nhaaa, microsoft? nhaaa</p>
<blockquote>no flash on mobile, no physical keyboard, html5 is next </blockquote>
<p>Have you even been reading The Verge? BB10 will be on devices with physical keyboards as well <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2992289/blackberry-10-physical-keyboard-word-prediction/in/2755145" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2992289/blackberry-10-physical-keyboard-word-prediction/in/2755145</a>.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s an iPhone 4?</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s a developer alpha device only meant to showcase the software, meanwhile the hardware is just there so that it can be held, used, and tested.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just a gadget hipster, always bored with things in a matter of months, but I&#8217;m liking BB10 (dat virtual keyboard looks amazing). If they come out with hardware like this for consumers&#8230;</p>
<p>Angry Birds Space HD for the Playbook is a native c++ app, <del>-</del>- not an android app.</p>
<p>Didnt know this supported the android emulation thingymajig.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get this straight. According to the article, this is not indicative of actual hardware nor is this really BlackBerryOS 10.  What remains, then, is a halfhearted attempt by RIM, released in order to get some attention.  oh, I&#8217;m sorry, I mean &#8220;give developers a chance to see their apps on a smaller screen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right. </p>
<p>I think RIM competitive factor was the hardware keyboard, once that is gone their are playing on the iPhone&#8217;s court, and they are too late for that one&#8230;</p>
<p>I like what I see. <br />
As a former Blackberry owner and fan, I got fed up with the crappy browser and slow interface and switched to the iPhone. Lately, however, Apple has not been making any great leaps with their operating system with their last two phones (IMHO) so if iPhone is unable to step it up this year with a substantial upgrade, this might bring me back to Blackberry.</p>
<p>Well at least Blackberry decided to create a whole new dimension of ugly for their comeback phone. Good luck with that RIM.</p>
<p>You know there is a touch one too right?</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s the same case, it&#8217;s still ugly!</p>
<p><img src="http://n4bb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BlackBerry-Z10-600x480.jpg" /></p>
<p>Josh has pointed out several times on the podcast (and I&#8217;m sure we all know or have at least met at least one example) that many of the blackberry holdouts are the ones that don&#8217;t like/want slabs. The blackberry addicts that are addicted to the reassurance of a tactile qwerty keyboard. This would more than likely be their device, I don&#8217;t think an all touch device would appeal to them at all.</p>
<p>I was a blackberry user myself for many years. And I was very reluctant to switch to a slab. My main concern was the massive reduction of typing speed. Recently I switched to nexus 4. I don&#8217;t count my previous bold as a smartphone , so n4 is technically my first smartphone. While my typing speed has been reduced a bit &#8211; the swipe keyboard is nothing short of amazing. And the extra screen real estate means I can finally use my phone for things other than texting or bbm. (Send from my N4). I think phones with tactile keys are soon going to become a thing of the past&#8230;. Best of luck to RIM.</p>
<p>IME predictive test is faster than a small, tactile keyboard</p>
<p>How about predictive text on a small, tactile keyboard?</p>
<p>Mate, give yourself a couple weeks and you&#8217;ll be flying on the Nexus 4 keyboard, I have a work given blackberry and I struggle (with typing on a physical keyboard and the sheer crappiness of the OS) .  I&#8217;m also typing this up from my Nexus 4 :)</p>
<p>6 letters per second. Send from my Bold 9900.</p>
<p>OMG man. . . . It&#8217;s Christmas Eve. Calm Down.</p>
<p>The back maybe, but the front look just like the current Bold, which is fine. It sees to me that the back is has a very gripy surface, much better than the metal &#8211; iPhone 5, glass &#8211; Nexus 4 / iPhone 4 or slippery plastics &#8211; S3.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s iconic. I really like them keeping their design.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s not ugly at all.</p>
<p>I agree. It actually looks like the ideal Keyboard BB 10 device I imagined. For BB fans sake I hope the screen is at least 4 inches. Also hopefully the keyboard is as good as that of the 9900&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The front looks perfectly fine. The issue is the back, though I don&#8217;t think &#8220;ugly&#8221; is the right word &#8212; &#8220;mediocre&#8221; might be a bit more accurate.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only so much you can do with a keyboard smartphone. The keys have actually changed to mimic the look of the all touch version.</p>
<p>But I agree with your statement, i think the back is boring to say the least. Not what I expected. Looks like something used on one of the current bb phones.</p>
<p>I actually like it.</p>
<p>Wow. I actually think it looks really good for a QWERTY phone (which always tend to look bad).</p>
<p>What is ugly about it? It&#8217;s better looking than some phones out on the market now.</p>
<p>mmm looks like they&#8217;re changing up their design and preparing for this relaunch of BlackBerry &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; oh wait looks like a BlackBerry from years past.</p>
<p>Shame, I actually want BlackBerry to survive but there is nothing compelling about BB 10 that makes me want one. Hopefully someone does.</p>
<p>and yes I know BlackBerry is their branding, and RIM is the company.. blabla troll away</p>
<p>So a modern OS with proper 3rd party browser support (and thus text reflow), that doesn&#8217;t have atrocious standby battery life, and doesn&#8217;t lag (because it&#8217;s not a repurposed bb OS 6/7 clone like android originally was) doesn&#8217;t seem appealing?</p>
<p>I actually think this one looks pretty good. It&#8217;ll sell well</p>
<p>Me too. I might even consider getting one if Nokia doesn&#8217;t come up with a new E-Series phone (without Symbian) soon.</p>
<p>I want a new E-series phone running WP8 so bad.  It seems like a no-brainer, since RIM essentially exited the smartphone market for a year, but I haven&#8217;t seen any indication that it&#8217;ll happen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame, because the e6 had fantastic hardware.  It was just weighted down by that albatross Symbian.</p>
<p>An E-Series Nokia must have features, that WP doesn&#8217;t support.</p>
<p>I like it, but the lack of physical call/end buttons is a deal breaker for me. I love how current bb are still PHONES, but this just looks like a keyboard slapped on so they can say they did.</p>
<p>Blackberry and Nokia should think about merging. After hitching their wagons to new items (Blackberry 10 and Nokia 920) they will go nowhere. Hence the new company, &#8220;No-Berry.&#8221;</p>
<p>That would never happen.</p>
<p>You. Are. HILARIOUS!</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t think Blackia would be successful?  Like the Metro UI or something, hmmm.</p>
<p>Cool! RIM is coming out with the pinnacle of Black and White TV Technology&#8230;in the 1970s, when color TV is already at critical mass.</p>
<p>The market has proven that the vast majority of people do not mind typing on glass.  My mom does it for god sakes!  RIMM should give up on this very small market of people who only want a hardware keyboard.  That is legacy RIMM.</p>
<p>Moronic comment. If your a reader of TheVerge you should know there is a full tocuhscreen model Z10 coming out as well. Why is it when the Z10 pics leaks people comment where is the QWERTY, RIM is dumb for not making QWERTY BB10 phones and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Because we know how easy it is to wind up BB fanboys? :-P</p>
<p>troll</p>
<p>More like it makes you look like an absolute dumbass</p>
<p>They needed something new, something impressive, something bold&#8230; This is not any of those.</p>
<p>The back looks horribly plasticy, but the front is actually pretty good!</p>
<p>Going by what the Bold 9900 is then you shouldn&#8217;t expect this to be plasticky, specially if it&#8217;s a flagship BB keyboarder.</p>
<p>Nice i like the keyboard. Wonder how big is the screen?</p>
<p>3.1&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m probably gonna end up getting both. I have a Galaxy S3 and iPhone 5 right now. I might sell both and replace them with this BlackBerry X10 and Z10. I can&#8217;t wait just 38 more sleep till BlackBerry 10 launch.</p>
<p>And&#8230; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll regret it.</p>
<p>Haters gonna hate. Really, how many iteration of a QWERY phone can you have? We already know BlackBerry has the best keyboard out there.</p>
<p>You Sir have a lot of logic for an internet commentator.</p>
<p>Well, <strong>had</strong>, and even that&#8217;s debatable.  But the straight-across layout is definitely going to be inferior to the previous one.  The upwards curve helps a lot when typing in such a tiny space.</p>
<p>Please show me other keyboards which are comparable. Believe it or not, there are people who need to type on actual keys as opposed to a touchscreen.</p>
<p>Motorola&#8217;s landscape keyboards are vastly superior in many respects, offering more space, a dedicated number row, and a more sensible button layout (a period key, for instance).</p>
<p>Indeed, Motorola&#8217;s <strong>portrait</strong> keyboards are basically a wholesale ripoff of RIM&#8217;s with some improvements.</p>
<p>HTC also had ridiculously good keyboards in devices like the Touch Pro 2 and Arrive before they abandoned them.</p>
<p>Nokia&#8217;s e-series keyboards also have advantages, including a better layout and arguably superior shortcuts.</p>
<p>Believe it or not.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>No, they aren&#8217;t. I&#8217;m used a landscape moto keyboard on a few droids, and they were <strong>always</strong> terrible.</p>
<p>The blackberry keyboard is much better. Also, no period key?? How is that necessary! You press the space bar twice, it&#8217;s easier than pressing a period and then the space, and if you need a period for something else you press the symbol key and press the key the period is on. It isn&#8217;t hard, in fact it&#8217;s faster, better, and easier.</p>
<p><strong>cough</strong> The <strong>alt</strong> key.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what Motorola keyboards you&#8217;ve been using.  The keyboard on my Droid 4 &#8211; which I&#8217;ve been using for just shy of a year &#8211; is fantastic.  The keys are nicely separated, very clicky, and have yet to fail in any respect.  What&#8217;s more, the backlighting is incredibly useful when in the dark.  Using a Blackberry keyboard would be a huge step backward for me, quite contrary to its vaunted utility for productivity.</p>
<p>And I use periods in a lot of contexts aside from the end of a sentence.  Not having a dedicated button for it is insane.  I&#8217;ll also note that it isn&#8217;t like having a period key <strong>precludes</strong> a period after a double space.</p>
<p>Interesting. When I think about it I use the period mostly for ending sentences.</p>
<p>So what are these contexts which require you to use lots and lots of periods&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;?</p>
<p>Besides elipses, it&#8217;s incredibly useful when typing out numbers (prices, for example, but also any time a decimal point is called for) and in any kind of serious document editing.  Attempting citation without a period button would be a nightmare.</p>
<p>Ok, so I take it that you enter a lot of prices on your phone for whatever reason (I assume in spreadsheets or something). But most people who have to do that still use laptops or tablets for this kind of work.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by attempting citation and why it cannot be done by pressing Alt+M to get the period?</p>
<p>Ah what a plain bullshit. First thing is, BB keyboards are also backlit. Second thing is, I wirte numbers, periods, and things like &quot;, [, ], *, #, @, +, &#8211; ?, !, /, :, ;, &#8216;, (, ), $, ^ very often on my BackBerry. Within time you&#8217;re getting to know the entire keyboard by rote, no dedicated buttons needed, I type very long texts on this thing and hit the &#8220;alt&#8221;-key blindly on the flight when I have to write any kind of special character. Even the numbers &#8211; it&#8217;s by far more convenient to have them as secondary items arranged like on a numpad than as primary items on dedicated keys within one top row.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any clue how you can call the best keyboard on the market &#8216;insane&#8217;. I&#8217;m german and in german you write every noun beginning with a capital letter, plus we have umlaute (ä / ö / ü) and the &#8216;sharp s&#8217; (ß). For each capital letter I either have to press the shift key once before I type the actual letter or I have to hold the button for 2 seconds and it turns into a capital letter. For ü, ä, ö and ß, I have to press and hold the key and have to scroll through with the trackpad. Thing is: although it seems to be absolutely &#8216;insane&#8217; to type german fast on this thing, I get speeds of up to 5 to 6 letters per second, without any predictive text or auto correction. Now THAT&#8217;s insane.</p>
<p>BS. The OG droid keyboard was terrible and most of the others are bad as well. Blackberry knows how to make a better keyboard with a smaller space.</p>
<p>The current Motorola landscape keyboard is absolutely nothing like the original, but thanks for trying.</p>
<p>Apparently, there was about 1mm worth of curve in the old 99xx series, although it looks more pronounced because of the higher amount of curve in the top row.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive damage control?</p>
<p>Leafs fans say the darndest things</p>
<p>Seems like some of these comments are generally anger filled or just plain BlackBerry hate filled. Its a phone, move on with your Christmas eve because you know you got to finish getting ready for tomorrow. Hope blackberry stays in the third spot, beating out windows phone and I hope everyone has a Merry Christmas!</p>
<p>Well said. Berry Christmas.. I mean Merry Christmas. lol.</p>
<p>BlackBerry is a solid number 4. Get used to it.</p>
<p>Yes sir! Solid number fo-whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat????<br />
Let me check market share numbers&#8230;<br />
You sir are full of shit!</p>
<p>My Eyes! Its almost as if RIM&#8217;s designers were told:<br />
 <br />
<strong>&#8220;You can create what ever phone you like &#8230; as long as it looks exactly like a Blackberry 9900 &#8230; and is big enough for proper touch input &#8230; Oh and the keyboard has to still be there!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>or, or! you can create a Bold with the same changes that an iPhone 4s had against an iPhone 4!</p>
<p>Now this is the BlackBerry 10 phone I&#8217;m waiting for!  I&#8217;ll miss the trackpad, but from what I&#8217;ve seen of BB10, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll miss it too much. Can&#8217;t wait to have it in my hands.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand the hate for this phone. Some people like keyboards. I have a Bold for work and typing emails on it is a real pleasure compared to my iphone  4. As to the rest of the OS, it&#8217;s not even close. Hopefully BB10 will make RIM competitive. I want more options not fewer options in the OS/hardware cell phone world.</p>
<p>Looks like a Photoshop of 9900 series Bold. It wouldn&#8217;t make sense for the N-series touch and QWERTY devices to deviate in style so much.</p>
<p>And not a very good &#8220;photoshop&#8221; job at that.  As an aside, it&#8217;s really odd how people take their phones so seriously, to the point where they&#8217;ll be willing to argue and trash talk.  As for me, I want the best phone that meets my capability requirements and falls within my budget.  Life can be that simple.  If a person loves their phone, then I&#8217;m some powerful happy for them.  But I&#8217;d prefer not being referred to as some sort of lower for owning another.  As for RIM successfully launching BlackBerry 10, seriously, what would be the harm in that?</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t a photoshop, the Verge has seen an actual QWERTY BB 10 phone, they knew it was real when they published the photo.</p>
<p>Not gonna argue that, cause it looks pretty much what I would have expected to look like.  But if that&#8217;s an actual photograph, it was either taken with a Captain Avenger secret decoder ring spy camera or shot through a condom.  The gloves, particularly, are a nice touch.  Gives you that &#8220;boys in the lab&#8221;  feel of authenticity.</p>
<p>The keyboard looks pretty nice. BlackBerry&#8217;s lineup is starting to become impressive.</p>
<p>I might just have to get them both if the OS is decent enough.</p>
<p>I hope the camera used to take the blur-noise shots is not the one used in the shipping device.  A nice camera cannot hurt their chances of success.</p>
<p>A nice camera also can&#8217;t exist in a cell phone.</p>
<p>Perspective. </p>
<p>I am not certain what you mean by &#8220;a nice camera cannot exist in a cell phone&#8221;?</p>
<p>There are quality cameras built into some phones. Do they compete with my full frame DSLR?  No. It seems like you&#8217;re playing a semantics game here?  What perspective do you see that forbids a decent sensor being used in a cell phone?</p>
<p>i bet there was an ergonomic reason for having a curved keyboard originally&#8230;<br />
which means they changed the keyboard solely to be different.<br />
form over function? this could be problematic as the keyboard doesn&#8217;t exist to be aesthetically pleasing but to type faster&#8230; so if they create a &#8217;pretty&#8217;* keyboard which types slower, it kind of removes the point of the keyboard.. which kind of removes the point of the BB.</p>
<p>*it&#8217;s not actually pretty, it looks like my £4 Trust keyboard</p>
<p>I blacked out from all the yawning.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t look too bad, I like hiw the keyboard goes all the way to the edge.</p>
<p>Looks great! Cannot wait!</p>
<p>This phone isn&#8217;t going to steal any customers from IOS or Android but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the goal for RIM. This phone is strictly for the hardcore BB users that love having a keyboard, your business and lawyer types that use their phones to do work and actually write emails longer and a few lines.<br />
If you&#8217;re commenting on how ugly it looks, you&#8217;re probably never in the space for a phone with a QWERTY keyboard.. so just move on.</p>
<p>Gonna reserve judgement until the high res pics and some video clips come out. Offline pricing is going to be critical the the success of the bb10 range, I&#8217;m thinking £350 for the z10 and £400 for the N series should just about do it.</p>
<p>Look like the love child of Bold 9900 and BlackBerry Porsche!</p>
<p>Come on RIM , you are doing everything else great. Get rid of the keyboard. It isn&#8217;t necessary, stop holding onto old technology, this is why you are dying.</p>
<p>You do realise there are people who specifically want a keyboard and thats why they are offering both an all touch and a QWERTY device.</p>
<p>We are individuals, with differing taste my friend</p>
<p>Fuck you&#8230; dont listen him RIM&#8230; I need keyboard&#8230;. I couldn&#8217;t care less for what this dragon has to say&#8230; give me my keyboard&#8230;</p>
<p>There you go.. now we  just need to know who pulls stronger</p>
<p>and just like that, windows phone slips into fourth place</p>
<p>Ah sure,  in your mind but how about actual innovation and current mindshare?</p>
<p>Just as bad as the other trolls who are bashing bb10</p>
<p>that doesnt look very good&#8230;</p>
<p>The best thing about BB was their keyboard, I don&#8217;t think I like the squared up layout.</p>
<p>This looks like a big Palm Pixi. Let&#8217;s hope it doesn&#8217;t go the same way. Now is not the time for RIM to take any notes from Palm.</p>
<p>No it doesn&#8217;t look like a Palm Pixi. Not at all.</p>
<p>The top half of the front could pass for a Nexus device if you remove that BB logo. The bottom looks like it was Frankensteined on there.</p>
<p>The back is forgivable, as the thickness and texture are probably to aid in holding the device comfortably with two hands for typing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played with the Dev non-keyboard model and thought that if the final hardware was close to that, RIM might have a decent device on their hands.  Also, the build of BB10 I had a chance to play with seemed smooth and bug-free.  My concern with this Bold-ish model is the screen size&#8230; BB10 felt much more tailored to a full screen environment and I just don&#8217;t see having a small screen would make for a good user experience.  Would landscape mode even give you anything? The screen is closer to square than rectangle.</p>
<p>It is square with a resolution of 720&#215;720. RIM already told that to developers long ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m ready for this baby!</p>
<p>Looks like they took the photos with a Blackberry too.</p>
<p>More likely a Lumia 920 and they forgot to switch the lights off &#8230; zing &#8230; badaboom</p>
<p>So basically they cut a Galaxy Nexus in half and stuck their keyboard to the bottom;: I approve!</p>
<p>I actually really like the iconic Bold design. Physical keyboards are still going to be around for quite some time. This is what the beauty of choice is; having the option of physical or virtual. Being able to touch something crafted is a special thing. Why do you think hardcore drivers still drool over stiff sporty suspensions, being able to feel the road, the tires, the gears. Anyway, I hope Rim stays true and keep the physical junkies out there happy&#8230;I mean, they are the ones currently keeping them around.</p>
<p>Nice looking phone but bb10 won&#8217;t have most apps that&#8217;s consumers are looking for. They have been a non factor for too long. I hope they can make a return but I still think it&#8217;s highly unlikely.</p>
<p>BB10 can run most Android apps unmodified. They just have to be repacked for distribution  in BB app world.</p>
<p><a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;won’t have most apps that’s consumers are looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great point here, just have a look at the piece of Tom Warren, in which he presents the must-have apps for freshly balked WP8 users. All of those are absoluetly standard feature apps that even BlackBerry 7 can deliver&#8230;</p>
<p>Take my moneyyyyyyyyy . Looks awesome!</p>
<p>Looks really plain, but thats how RIM works every phone looks exactly like the last with no innovation in design</p>
<p>Yeah other than HTC, Apple or Samsung, where each phone was a real innovation in design &#8211; lol. /irony off</p>
<p>What we need is innovation in software. We haven&#8217;t seen innovation in software for&#8230; since 2007, despite Google Now. Well at least, BB10 is the first native software innovation since the original iPhone.</p>
<p>was gona get a blackberry!but gees cant they make their phone pretty!is this the best look they can come up with!PIMP YOUR SMARTPHONE R.I.M !if Samsung can make a sex s3 why not rim!</p>
<p>Ill buy it. Been searching for a new qwerty keyboard phone and this one does it. Got tired of the touch screen on the iPhone already.</p>
<p>The gesture-keyboard looks intuitive-enough.</p>
<p>The only thing is there&#8217;s no reason why devs can&#8217;t make an Android keyboard that does the same thing.</p>
<p>Exactly. Unless RIM have patented this and intend to licence it out like T9.  I&#8217;m interested to try this but not sure if this would save me time. I&#8217;m now so fluent with my iPhone and iPad keyboard, certainly fasterthan I was with my actual BlackBerry, which I think is because I only need touch the screen and not excert muscle pressure to press a key.</p>
<p>Yea, I wonder about time saving as well.</p>
<p>To me this seems like it would be quite useful for one-handed typing, and certainly save time when doing that; but, I would assume that two-thumb typing would still just be faster by typing everything out quickly, and having auto-correct take care of the small errors.</p>
<p>Or RIM have patented it and don&#8217;t intend to licence it out. I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;d sue anybody that copied it but there is not guarantee they would licence it to others because they want unique features for their platform.</p>
<p>SwiftKey could easily add this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure SwiftKey are the guys behind the BB keyboard.</p>
<p>They are.</p>
<p>All these features look amazing and I hope to have them in my next android rom</p>
<p>Android devs can COPY anything&#8230;.how bout something original android = vulture = scavenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll only get better&#8221; &#8211; hope RIM don&#8217;t run out of tine. Competition is good</p>
<p>Yes,  competition is good, but RIM is proving they don&#8217;t really know how to adapt. Blackberry 10 is way overdue and probably will not gain much marketshare from people fleeing their platform right now. They had their time, it was all of last decade, and they never stepped up.</p>
<p>To clarify, Blackberry 10 does look good, but it needs to be fantastic to compete with ICS, iOS 5 and Mango today, and I don&#8217;t see it being that level of software, there isn&#8217;t time to play catch-up, this needs to be the software to get them in the race, and I don&#8217;t see it.</p>
<p>By the time Blackberry 10 launches, it will be competing with iOS6 or maybe 7 as well as Windows Phone 8 (and 8.5 around the corner) and Android Jellybean or even Keylime Pie&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to have to be able to survive a few bad generations to catchup, so it had better do the most important things 100% right when it launches so it doesn&#8217;t end up with a problem (like WP/iOS have with Multitasking or Android has with fragmentation)</p>
<p>Hey, at least it has a mail client!</p>
<p>I think the conditions to win are not the same as the ones needed in order to play. The company has done basically every single thing people suggested it should do, and reception has been quite positive. Their OS doesn&#8217;t need to be &#8220;fantastic&#8221; if their competitors&#8217; are arguably not. I believe the OS &#8220;experience&#8221; has subsided as it is really the ecosystem which provides the actual content and interaction to the user, especially with iOS and Android &#8211; and I believe somewhere down the road to maturity some &#8220;flavor&#8221; has been lost. The thing is that we&#8217;re no longer in the same situation as 2-3 years ago. Competition is also about providing a unique and colorful experience and I believe RIM will do that and more.</p>
<p>Uhh, the current phone OS&#8217;s are fantastic right now, how are they not?</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s my point, it&#8217;s that I find some of them more mature than fantastic, and I&#8217;m interested in a renewed UI experience with unique features. I mean iOS and Android are great. I&#8217;d just like to see that qnx/web os somewhat inspired OS 10 with tiles etc. come to fruition. I like original products and more choices.</p>
<p>To be honest all the 4 platforms don&#8217;t really do too much all that different. If you seriously think about&#8230;email, instant messaging,, calls, internet, everything else, is unfortunately apps. Which in my opinion is getting very overrated. Most do the same thing with different names. So that leaves a simple solution&#8230;.integrate with bookmarks that can have widgets or screenshots to be saved on screen&#8230;..what is the difference&#8230;</p>
<p>Competition is great, but only when it&#8217;s actually competition.  Blackberry is a good 3-4 years off of being even remotely competitive.</p>
<p>As much as I know RIM will most likely die off soon, a part of me still wants them to survive. I dont know why.</p>
<p>Choice.</p>
<p>Elaborate please.</p>
<p>I think he meant Choice = the freedom to choose between multiple devices instead of just the duopoly of Android and iOS right now.</p>
<p>That makes sense. I also think it&#8217;s because I just love technology in general and would always welcome new operating systems/devices.</p>
<p>Pretty sure not many people are going to come aboard to Blackberry just because of their neat keyboard, especially when Windows phone already has a great one. What else is the hook for this Blackberry 10, the UI? Apps (not likely), so what&#8217;s the differences for BB10 other than the keyboard. If there isn&#8217;t one, RIM messed up yet again.</p>
<p>Yes that&#8217;s what I meant. Thanks</p>
<p>The longer you watch the tech market, the more you see how dynamic it is. What seems dominant/ permanent today may look SCSI tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oh, I remember the days when I dreamt of being rich enough one day to afford a SCSI drive.</p>
<p>I want RIM to come back big and bad. That phone looks SWEET, like the Playbook had a baby.</p>
<p>All babies look cute.</p>
<p>Ever since I bought the BlackBerry Storm, I&#8217;ve been like, &#8220;F*%k RIM!&#8221;</p>
<p>and who&#8217;s fault is that?</p>
<p>Rims?</p>
<p>I blame Canada in general.</p>
<p>:( My feelings are hurt.</p>
<p>BLAME CANADA! BLAME CANADA!</p>
<p>&#8230;BTW, I&#8217;m Canadian</p>
<p>Hey look&#8230; an actual hands on. I guess he knows something Josh doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>the surface hands on wasn&#8217;t by josh I think</p>
<p>He was&#8230; in t he video&#8230; lol</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they need to add so many gimmicks to the &#8216;predictive text&#8217;. Ussually when I need to type quickly, I just jam on the soft keys and correct the words after I am done typing. What I don&#8217;t want to do is press a letter and read all the little words BB thinks I like, it would be faster just typing what I want right there instead of searching for what I want. Also the gestures in a keyboard seem extremely jankey to me, I don&#8217;t want to swipe up for CAP, what if I hit the key above it? All of this to me is gimmick to differentiate their platform, nothing seems user friendly. But of course the proof is in the pudding, the one I&#8217;ll never try because it&#8217;s on a blackberry.</p>
<p>Someone&#8217;s never used SwiftKey.</p>
<p>I never found the stock Android keyboard to be all that great, and I can&#8217;t comment on iOS but between the Playbook keyboard (which uses Swiftkey anyways), the WebOS keyboard and the Windows Phone keyboard I&#8217;ve used (as well as a plethora of stock Android keyboards and &#8220;not-so-stock&#8221; keyboards) my personal favorite still remains the WP7 one.</p>
<p>If RIM can match that, they&#8217;ll have something fantastic.</p>
<p>Windows phone keyboard is a lot like this one, it predicts what word you will spell and increases the sensitivity of the first letter of the predicted word. So if I type I&#8217;ll be, it will increase the T&#8217;s sensitivity predicting I will type &#8220;I&#8217;ll be there.&#8221; Blackberry just shows you the predicted word &#8220;THERE&#8221; above the T, and I don&#8217;t like that, I don&#8217;t want to read while I am typing quickly.</p>
<p>BB10 keyboard is reported to have that same functionality (watch the keynote). it should be more adaptive than you make it out to be&#8230;.nonetheless time will tell.</p>
<p>i personally prefer a a do over like this versus the incremental upgrades we&#8217;ve seen from all mobile OS makers over the past years</p>
<p>His unibrow. I couldn&#8217;t stop starring at it.</p>
<p>Was just about to post the same&#8230;haha&#8230;it&#8217;s worse because it is asymmetrical!</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m a terrible person&#8230;:-(</p>
<p><img src="http://mm.yimg.com/image/resize/*/550x4500/true/false/http%3A%2F%2Fmeme.zenfs.com%2Fu%2F02fe9ff73588d97a9b20c64e266092d09fec6a94.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Am I the only person who hates predictive keyboards? I always turn off the suggestions/correction/predictions on my android keyboard, and I don&#8217;t use anything like Swype or SwiftKey. I want to be absolute with how I type, meaning what I type is what actually gets written. Sure, I usually make tons of mistakes, but that makes the keyboard less intrusive and ironically less unpredictable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on your boat. Auto correction is the worst nightmare.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/" target="_blank">http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/</a></p>
<p>Plus you remember how to spell words</p>
<p>I kinda think Windows Phone has the best keyboard out of everyone right now.    The ICS stock keyboard is nowhere near as good as Joshua makes it out to be imo.  On my Evo i went right back to Swiftkey.</p>
<p>WP7&#8217;s keyboard is indeed great. I picked WP7 phone in part because of the excellent keyboard.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, um, uh, um&#8230; that really makes it hard to watch.</p>
<p>Maybe, uh, he was umm, channelling Jeff ah, Goldblum&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh hi there SwiftKey.</p>
<p>Has anyone else used the SwiftKey 3 Beta?  It&#8217;s <em>ridiculously</em> good at predicting both word and space-insertion prediction.</p>
<p>I have&#8230; and yes it is ridiculously good. I also like the new theme they&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>hmm, does anyone else think that having swiftkey predictive text which see what you write and the context it is written in might be a security problem for corporate and  govt users?</p>
<p>Where is your tinfoil hat?</p>
<p>but I&#8217;m sure you know for sure huh&#8230;.</p>
<p>There is only one way to save RIM &#8220;Put Android on Blackberries&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hate that solution. BB can come back. That phone is better then the London. Android should stay in plastic land and let the average kiddies who can&#8217;t handle themselves in school have something to do and become cynical, and create and live in their own universe until the go outside and become the sniveling walking skin till they get home again and go back to the fantasy&#8230;&#8230;Freud 101</p>
<p>Too little too late, I&#8217;m afraid&#8230; BB10 has to be trully epic in order to make any kind of impact on the market. And the competition is getting stronger by the day (Tizen, Mozilla OS)&#8230;</p>
<p>Blackberry has the very rare chance to re-do.<br />
1. Don&#8217;t call a press conference<br />
2. Make the product<br />
3 Load the website with ALL the information<br />
4 Show some in-house vids of the minds behind the product<br />
5 Keep adding to what you already have out (Playbook, Phone )<br />
6 Repeat</p>
<p>So bland.</p>
<p>Spice it up by turning on the captions on the video and using the translate function. Those are some funny translations.</p>
<p>these captions rule</p>

<p>The new BlackBerry™ FormFactorEveryoneHasBeenUsingSince 2007.</p>
<p>Arrives in stores 2013.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has had an all touch form factor since 2008.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>Yeah, the Storm took the market by storm with its lag and resistive touch screen.</p>
<p>Yes, but that&#8217;s irrelevant, because my point was merely that this is not a new form factor for RIM.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe he actually said that the browser has new features that never have been seen before, and then he makes a &#8216;zoom&#8217;. Com&#8217; on man&#8230;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t reveal the actual feature though.  It is a voice activated &#8220;zoom zoom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is something about the browser that has never been seen before. <br />
<a href="http://html5test.com/results/tablet.html" target="_blank">http://html5test.com/results/tablet.html</a><br />
Look for the number 465 and who it belongs to. Then go look at any other browser out there(mobile or desktop)</p>
<p>impressive</p>
<p>I was going to make a translation of what the guy says (for non-spanish-talkers) but afetr watching all the video&#8230; It&#8217;s just pointless to do so, as pointless (even though I give them credit for trying) as RIM trying to bring BB 10 as a hell of an OS in 2012 when this is what they needed to do like 2 years ago</p>
<p>Is that a touchscreen keyboard??? No way!</p>
<p>LOL not only on screen keyboard but the best one there is. Hard to swallow I know.</p>
<p>Maybe hard to swallow in 2008.</p>
<p>LOL. Open your eyes and you will see.</p>
<p>Better than the Windows Phone or iOS keyboard? Don&#8217;t think so. And don&#8217;t even get me started with SwiftKey for Android.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to assume that you haven&#8217;t even taken the time to see what the new keyboard is like so here is a little video.<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdhZ5kFrf1g" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdhZ5kFrf1g</a></p>
<p>Hopefully if typing on a BB10 keyboard is as good as iOS they will dedicate websites to how amazing it is /s</p>
<p>Oh I&#8217;ve seen it alright. There&#8217;s nothing revolutionary about this keyboard, that&#8217;s of course not saying it&#8217;s bad, because it&#8217;s actually better than the stock Android keyboard. But it&#8217;s not better than the WP or iOS keyboard per se.</p>
<p>Predictive text is something all major keyboards do well. Just because BB10&#8217;s keyboard happens to suggest predicted words above each starting letter doesn&#8217;t make it any better. SwiftKey does this very thing, and it even goes a step further by not only predicting your words, but by algorithmically seeing patterns in both actual text and typing style (eg. speed to accuracy ratio).</p>
<p>The BB10 keyboard is way better than any other.</p>
<p>1. Popping up predicted words above specific letters you&#8217;re going to type next is a way better approach. It&#8217;s much more convenient to look at the letters you&#8217;re typing than at a line of words above the keyboard. Also the swipe-up-gesture to confirm is very convenient.<br />
2. Predictive text isn&#8217;t just predictive text. The predicitve text engine behind BB10 is the most fortunate to date in terms of context and learnability<br />
3. It&#8217;s multilingual (!) predictive text</p>
<p>People just can&#8217;t credit RIM doing something right. WP8 or iOS keyboards are just mickey mouse against this. Just face it.</p>
<p>So how is it better than Swiftkey?</p>
<p>1. You don&#8217;t have to look up at the predicted words, you can keep attention at typing and predicted words at the same time<br />
2. You don&#8217;t have to move the finger off the keyboard to confirm predicted words<br />
3. It can show more than three predicted words at the same time and you don&#8217;t even loose the overview, because all predicted words show up at the next predicted letter at which you&#8217;re looking anyway<br />
4. Confirming and deleting entire words by one swipe (don&#8217;t know if SK supports this too)<br />
5. Multilingual word prediction (specially useful in countries where english isn&#8217;t the spoken language)</p>
<p>I do know the kind of word prediction SwiftKey is about from my BlackBerry PlayBook. I just don&#8217;t use it because I don&#8217;t want to search for the right word at the top line all the time. By the time I find it I could&#8217;ve typed it manually.</p>
<p>With swiftkey you can basically just type away and then accept the result.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather have the suggestions in a fixed spot too. Although BB would give the suggestion before you even typed it I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s just like you said. You type &#8220;he&#8221; &gt; look up &gt; is there a &#8216;hello&#8217;? &gt; YES &gt; Confirm &gt; back to the keyboard. That sucks IMO. At BB10 it&#8217;s like that: Type &#8220;he&#8221; &gt; as you want to hit the &#8220;L&#8221; you see the prediction at the same place you want to type anyway and flick it up instead of typing it. <br />
But anyway &#8211; I didn&#8217;t even mean to shit on SwiftKey. The guy I was referring to, originally said that the BB10 keyboard isn&#8217;t even better than the traditional ones on iOS and Windows Phone. I mean hello!? How ridiculous is this? That guy must be blind. Just ignoring things as hard as he can.</p>
<p>Having the suggestions pop up all over the keyboard is in fact a poorer implementation.</p>
<p>With other keyboards you can simply focus on one spot and click that word or space to accept. Much faster than needing to glance around a keyboard and doing annoying swipes. Which is also more cumbersome than just typing a key.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you know what &#8220;poor implementation&#8221; means. No glancing around needed. You&#8217;re looking automatically at the specific letter above which the word is displayed. And I don&#8217;t know which &#8220;spot&#8221; do you mean I can focus at. I think 90% of the people can&#8217;t type blind on touchscreen keyboards. Means they switch their attention between the written text and the letters they&#8217;re are typing on constantly.</p>
<p>I said &#8220;poor<strong>er</strong>&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;spot&#8221; which you can focus on is the suggestion box. I doubt blackberry users can&#8217;t type blind. I have seen tons of them and they all do. The same works on an on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>I use BlackBerry QWERTY-Phones for 3.5 yrs now and yes, I can type blind. But I doubt I can do so on an onscreen keyboard, because of the lack of tactile feedback. Well, I&#8217;ll find out when the L-Series launches. However my experience so far of typing on Android devices is horrible, whereas the iPhone keyboard is pretty good for an onscreen keyboard. We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>No Swype love? :(</p>
<p>EVERYONE! COME LOOK! The last of the Blackberry fanboys before they go extinct!</p>
<p>We must dissect him, the last to adapt to the changing environment.</p>
<p>LOL!!!</p>
<p>I created a Verge account just to say LOL!  Nicely put :)<br />
BB10 gonna rock!</p>
<p>i was very much into RIM for a while, but moved on adn unfortunately i am just not seeing anything that makes me want to jump back on that sinking ship.  Too little too late IMO&#8230;.</p>
<p>the make great hardware though&#8230; should jump on the android train.</p>
<p>Only issue is adroid is a junk and nonsecure OS.</p>

<p>Like that couldn&#8217;t be reproduced on any other phone</p>
<p>OHBURN</p>
<p>never heard of that OS before, did u write the code in yo mama&#8217;s basement !</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen other videos. The OS is way better than anything else out there. The only phone with true multitasking.</p>
<p>Lol?</p>
<p>No doubt their new OS will be great, but maybe it&#8217;s all too late.</p>
<p>What does that even mean? Its too late? so everyone should just stop trying and stop competing because there will NEVER be another OS? If everyone was a quitter like you we would have ZERO innovation. It is NEVER too late.</p>
<p>You know what phone has true multitasking? The Lumia 920.</p>
<p>So any app you run will continue fully running in the background while you run other apps until you close it? There are no mobile OSs which do this with the exception of the browser apps which tend to render in the background in mist OSs. Even webOS paused apps when minimised to card view.</p>
<p>As far as I know; as soon as you leave an app in WP8 it will be suspended. Just like Android and iOS.</p>
<p>I guess the meme train left before you got to the station?</p>
<p>Blackberry fanboys don&#8217;t have a sense of humour. To be fair, there&#8217;s not much for them to laugh about.</p>
<p>So all apps keep running when you switch away from them?  Sounds awful.  I presume you can turn that off like you can on the Playbook?  Because I really don&#8217;t need Need for Speed to keep driving in the background while I&#8217;m reading email.</p>
<p>The only phone with true multitasking is the Samsung Galaxy Note II</p>
<p>This one just never gets old for me :)</p>
<p>are you high?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think them being &#8216;late&#8217; will matter. They can easily compete with Windows phone. The QNX based OS is solid, better than android I&#8217;d say. Also the cascades UI is new and fresh with their flows, arguably better than windows metro UI . Unfortunately, people are cling on to the familiar and will not veer away from their ecosystem bubble&#8217;s even if what the competition offer is better.</p>
<p>And besides BlackBerry still have a customer base, however small it is. Especially, outside of North America.  And security wise, they are still the best which consumers should actually start to embrace considering how are lifestyle has trended to embrace having sensitive information on their cellphones.</p>
<p>Two phones against an avalanche of Windows Phone 8, erm, phones, means that RIM cannot, and will not win. At this point its a numbers game for the third spot, and RIM can&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>Is it a leak if an employee is showing it off to a tech blog on video? Seems like an weak attempt to get press coverage with a very incremental reveal. There are a couple things <em>actually</em> <em>launching</em> this month, so it&#8217;s easy to forget about these guys.</p>
<p>More interesting than the video is the number of comments here. The lack of interest on a tech website is telling, to say the least.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because BlackBerry fans are tired of the constant negativity. I bet many of the people making posts about how it&#8217;s too late or this should have been done in 2008 blah blah blah never even owned a BlackBerry. It&#8217;s cool to bash them so they do. I own a Galaxy S3 now, and I love it. I&#8217;m willing to give a new BlackBerry a shot though, I think what I&#8217;m seeing, I like. As of right now, the S3 is almost everything I could want, but it lacks in the little things that my Bold was perfect at. I can&#8217;t even back up my phone right now unless I root it. Messaging, calendar, email&#8230;perfect. But, it wasn&#8217;t fun, it was a powerful communicator. Right now, I have fun over what I use my phone for the most, communication. If BlackBerry can have both, them I&#8217;m all in. Go to a BlackBerry fan site and you will see where all of the fans are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned a BlackBerry. It&#8217;s to late, this should have been done years ago. Nothing I&#8217;ve seen is even remotely exciting, the keyboard looks alright and that&#8217;s about it. I don&#8217;t want them to fail because competition is good but I&#8217;m also realistic.</p>
<p>So you say it&#8217;s too late yet you don&#8217;t want them to fail, therefore its not too late then&#8230;to become #3!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never personally bought a BB. Only have one from work. There have been many, many moments I wanted BB to just die already. But seeing more about the BB10, the more I like what I see. People talk about the keyboard. That&#8217;s just one feature, and its good. The biggest feature that the BB10 have and that no other phones have are gestures, through the aid of having side bezels. It seems so fluent. There&#8217;s a learning curve to it, that once you use it, you won&#8217;t find any other way to use a phone.</p>
<p>A positive way to see it is that most of the trolls are gone, which is quite a relief. They&#8217;re gone because there&#8217;s been interesting stuff about BB10 in the last few months and even the development devices seemed somewhat appealing while the specs seemed great. If someone clicks on the BB hub, he can see there&#8217;s coverage about many of the upcoming features (navigation content provider, UI, camera app, dev incentives, server side stuff, etc.) but some people think it&#8217;s too late&#8230; some others need it to be too late. In any case we&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>
<p>Wow, the English he is speaking sounds really funny.</p>
<p>BlackBerry handset has good built quality. It will sell well if using Android or Windows Phone. They should keep good things they have and throw away the rotten ones, i.e. BlackBerry OS and mail service. Exchange and Lotus Notes provides encrypted mobile access so blackberry mail service is not needed.</p>
<p>Actually that is entirely untrue. I work in financial services and if I want to do anything involving client information on my phone I have to use a bb. Bb makes the ONLY phones that are compliant, (ie they would fine my ass or possibly shut us down if I was accessing client info on an IOS, Droid, or WP device.</p>
<p>Love it</p>
<p>blackberry was the worst phone i ever owned.  They would have to give this thing away for anyone to want it. Much less assume someone is going to develop for this platform lol</p>
<p>I would happily use a 4&quot; model as my second phone for things like work emails.</p>
<p>WAKE UP!  BB 10 will change everything!</p>
<p>Wow the word prediction looks like the best out there. At least RIM didn&#8217;t dumb down the keyboard on this new OS. Guy should of used a better mic, couldn&#8217;t tell he was speaking spanish for the 1st min.</p>
<p>I just love the funky background music</p>
<p>I really hope blackberry 10 is a winner!</p>
<p>More likely that this is the number of units they are going to sell . . .</p>
<p><img src="http://silellak.com/gifs/BOOM.gif" /></p>
<p>Why stop at six? Why not 12? Or 20? Why not offer consumers several dozen choices of phone?</p>
<p>It’d be great to see RIM climb back into the game, but this announcement makes it pretty clear they still fundamentally don’t understand the advantages they competitors are leveraging.</p>
<p>Have you heard of over saturation?</p>
<p>Works for Android.</p>
<p>It works for Samsung, I&#8217;m not sure about the rest of them.</p>
<p>Honestly, at this point, I think it would be beneficial for them to focus on one or two products to make sure their experience is solid. These two products in my mind would be a full touchscreen device, and a full QWERTY device. I hate to bring Apple into the mix, but one reason Apple succeeds is because they have one phone to worry about, and they do it well. I feel like it&#8217;s hard to divide your company&#8217;s efforts and resources across multiple projects instead of one or two.</p>
<p>Yes, 20 phone models is obviosuly how Apple became successfull. No, the more products you offer the less you&#8217;re able to support them. Phones for low end is maintained by continuing selling the previous version with maintained support. A couple different sizes of the same phone would be appriciated and in RIMs case, some with physical keyboard but 6 seems perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Yo snoozemode, Imma let you finish, but Samsung is the top phone manufacturer in the world. Not Apple. And they have many, many more smartphone options than Apple. So don&#8217;t knock having a variety of models. Different companies have different strategies. Some strategies, like Samsung&#8217;s, make you the top smartphone manufacturer in the world.</p>
<p>They sure do, but which phones has the buzz going? The galaxy line. Where are the big margins? The galaxy line. What is selling in millions and millions? The galaxy line. Samsung quickly understood Apples &#8220;one phone philosphy&#8221; and soon adapted their massive portfolio to it, just look at the launch of SGS3 in the US compared to SGS2.</p>
<p>Except Apple typically stops pushing certain model phones after a while. Whereas I could still go out right now and buy a GS!!, GSII Skyrocket, GSIII, Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note II, Galaxy S III Mini, and probably even a Galaxy S at some locales.  That&#8217;s at least&#8230;Oh, look, 6 models! Maybe 7.</p>
<p>Hmm, not really. I can still buy an Iphone 4, which is 2.5 years old, and there&#8217;s still some supply left of 3GS which is 3.5 years old.</p>
<p>Bullshit you can&#8217;t buy the 3GS anymore..</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some stock left in stores (Europe). Anyway, continued sale and support for previous version instead of spending new money on R&amp;D and marketing for a new device with yesterday specs can only be good in my book when it comes to getting high margins aswell as customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>There is nowhere in the world where you can purchase a 3GS? Oh, okay.</p>
<p>I work for Best Buy Mobile. We still have a handful of 3Gs in stock (and we actually received one on our shipment the other day&#8230;)</p>
<p>since when do Best Buy Mobile workers know anything about cell phones. You probably just think the iPhone 5 is the 3Gs, it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>No reason to be a douchebag&#8230;</p>
<p>Samsung is the top phone manufacturer in the world only in terms of quantity. Apple makes 75% of the mobile industry&#8217;s profits with only 9% of world&#8217;s phones:<br />
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/apple-makes-75-of-mobile-phone-profits-with-only-9-of-the-phones/252548/"></a></p>
<p>One of the many reasons, Apple makes so much more money is because of having a streamlines production system with very few models. They spend billions of dollars in buying all of the flash memory years in advance. They actually are largest buyers of flash memory in world. With fewer models equal more production efficiency and less wastage of stock.</p>

<p>Precisely, Nokia still has gazillions of low end devices in developing markets and still makes xx millions of phones, but the margins and profit is a completely different story as we all know by now..</p>
<p>Which says there&#8217;s HUGE opportunity for lower cost manufacturers to eat into those margins.</p>
<p>Which they&#8217;re doing, rather rapidly, looking at global market share.</p>
<p>Why would you look at global market share if you&#8217;re interested in profit margins?</p>
<p>Because network effects can wreak havoc on a platform if it&#8217;s popularity starts waning. Apple has learned this lesson well after the dektop wars in the 90&#8217;s and that is why I find the rumours of them releasing a budget iPhone of some sort pretty plausible. They might even restrict sales to certain countries.</p>
<p>It is not just that though. Samsung spends more on advertising than all their competitors combined, including Apple.  This is why they sell all those phones  and partly why they don&#8217;t have all the profit.  It&#8217;s taken them vast quantities of money to get to that point.</p>
<p>It really doesn&#8217;t matter. The best form of marketing is music videos, tv shows, and movies. Guess what most of hollywood movies and tv shows use apple products in their movies/tv shows. I&#8217;ve yet to see a specific samsung product being shown. And you know what, apple doesn&#8217;t even pay to have their products displayed. It&#8217;s free marketing most of the time. Remember apple&#8217;s never been much about marketshare. Even with such low marketshare in the desktop market, they still make a lot of profits. Global market share is not a sustainable business idea. Most of the third world and developing world won&#8217;t buy your apps or subscriptions. That&#8217;s why android phones are basically normally used outside. Most people in first world countries spend a lot of money in apps and services.</p>
<p>Maybe if Google made it easier to pay for apps (and Amazon made it POSSIBLE at all!) outside the few developed countries it is easy to do so in, there&#8217;d be more app purchases. Even in countries famous for widespread poverty, there are middle and upper class people that would like to buy apps and content, but geoblocking makes pirates of the virtuous.</p>
<p>6 throughout the year is definitely accpetable. A 4.2 inch, a 4.6 inch (as per rumors), and a 5 inch (a guess). For keyboards they would have the X10, a lower end, Curve esque device, and maybe a portrait slider (a la torch). Spread those throughout the year and it wouldn&#8217;t be too bad. At least we know the screen will have either a 1280&#215;720, 1280&#215;768, or 720&#215;720. No crappy ppi&#8217;s, though their can be bad screens&#8230;</p>
<p>I think 4.2, 4.6 and 5&quot; in the alltouch range isn&#8217;t very likely, because those three would&#8217;ve all been high-end devices. The Z10 with its 4.2&quot; display already aims at the high-end market.</p>
<p>The 4.6 &#8220;Aristo&#8221; is already rumored. I just took it a step further based off of the interval between the other 2.</p>
<p><img src="http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3ukjoZoXZ1r8nrkqo1_500.gif" /></p>
<p>They don&#8217;t have money like sand.</p>
<p>Blackberry and rim have been doing bad. But what&#8217;s even more funny is while rim was going. Down market share wise and consumer mind share. Microsoft and windows phone still couldn&#8217;t over take them. Some people and windows phone fan. Like to dream their in 3rd place. When that&#8217;s far from. From the truth, not a rim fan or anything. Just wanted to throw some facts out there,and inform some fanboys.</p>

<p>That is why I will never understand why RIM gets such a bad rap, even by The Verge staff! Blackberry is doing considerably better then Microsoft. I like a lot of what BB10 is doing. It is a gesture OS. It will have solid performance and multitasking (as already shown in videos). It will have high density displays (all of them as long as they don&#8217;t go past 5 inches). They are offering keyboards for those that want them. A few of these were just getting praises from the Mobile show crew, but for Ubuntu! The only difference with Ubuntu is that it can be plugged into a monitor and also run that. Then the proceeded to trash Blackberry. I don&#8217;t get it&#8230;</p>
<p>I think RIM is also heading towards this plug-into-a-monitor direction in the mid- to long-term, Heins said something like that.</p>
<p>Ya, having more than 4 or 5 phone models sure hasn&#8217;t worked for Samsung.</p>
<p>They should focus just on making Porsche design Blackberries for $2,000, that can be a niche.</p>
<p>at least that one more unit that windows phone</p>
<p>It&#8217;s canadian, so it&#8217;s most likely going to suck too!</p>
<p>Canada gave us Bieber, Bryan Adams, and Celine Dion. /s</p>
<p>The sad thing is so many people recommended you&#8230;</p>
<p>And at least all of them will fail.</p>
<p>Will you just shut up. But before you do, can I borrow your crystal ball? You must be rich off of it&#8230;</p>
<p>The lack of carrier exclusives is a good move &#8211; at least it gives them a fighting chance.  They&#8217;ve got to scoop up every potential customer, and if it costs them in margin so be it.</p>
<p>I thought RIM was going to have at least a halfway decent chance announcing this and shipping 2 or so weeks later. But I read an article on Forbes saying that devices may not ship until March.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, they&#8217;re going to need a miracle considering that high end devices are shipping first and low end devices would probably come much, much later. The only thing that&#8217;s keeping RIM from completely nose diving right now is low end devices being sold in developing markets.  And as it is right now they&#8217;re increasingly losing sales to low end android handsets and to a lesser extent some of the recent low cost WP handsets.</p>
<p>High, mid and low touchscreen and<br />
High, mid and low qwerty keyboard entries we can assume.</p>
<p>Rather than making just ONE phone that anybody actually wants.</p>
<p>Yes, let&#8217;s exclude people who can&#8217;t afford an expensive phone.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re better off retaining and regaining as many customers as possible.  In the UK at least, it&#8217;s teenagers who seem their main market and a lot can&#8217;t afford the latest and greatest.</p>
<p>RIM needs to make money not sell a billion phones.  In fact there is no way in hell they will be able to attain market share dominance and they know this.  They should focus on a tighter line and make it profitable.</p>
<p>They will not win the market share numbers war with Samsung and they will not win the profit war with Apple.</p>
<p>You are aware that RIM has an international network (91 countries) called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry#BlackBerry_Internet_Service" target="new">BlackBerry Internet Service.</a> (BIS) If you get data on a BB through your carrier it travels over RIM&#8217;s BIS. Carriers pay RIM for this service. Some pass the cost on to the customer but not all. In any case the more phones RIM has activated the more they stand to make.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll move away mostly from BIS with BB10. In BB10 you&#8217;ll need a BIS dataplan only if you want to use BBM.</p>
<p>Oh come on. No MMS, no taskswitcher, no multitasking, no copy &amp; paste, no sound profiles,&#8230;the first iPhone was anything but smart. It was a dumb phone with a shiny, fluid UI attached to it. And the first to have a capacitive touchscreen. But in terms of functionality or anything else, the iPhone 1 was NEVER better than anything else on the market. It sold through smoothness, eyecandy, the web browser and Google maps and ease of use and intuitiveness. But it sure was a stupid, primitive device.</p>
<p>Actually the LG Prada was the first to have a capacitive display. However, it wasn&#8217;t multitouch.</p>
<p>Either that or 1 TouchScreen and 1 qwerty on AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mo</p>
<p>Sprint?</p>
<p>Sprint might not &#8216;Buy-In&#8217; right away.  They seem to play the &#8217;Wait and See&quot; game these days.</p>
<p>Sprint who?</p>
<p>Well, we have already heard rumors of the Aristo (4.6 inch) that will launch later on so this is probably incorrect. Unless they did 1 GSM and one CDMA for the 3 phones rumored.</p>
<p>I think you hit the nail on the head. Keeping in mind the majority of current Blackberry Users are outside of North America. This will allow people to get the phone of their style at their price point.</p>
<p>See my post below&#8230; guessing high-end and entry-level devices for each of all-touch, qwerty and slider form factors.</p>
<p>I feel bad for RIM, but ffs they just don&#8217;t get it. In the world of iOS and Android, they come up with this? Hell, I&#8217;d rather use Badu or Meego as an OS. I feel for the people who are going to lose their jobs, but they need to innovate, and this isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>You say that like you&#8217;ve used or even seen BB10 in action.</p>
<p>Having used BB7 before, I can easily say that. I&#8217;ve also seen the videos of BB10 before and I wasn&#8217;t impressed.</p>
<p>You must realize then that BB7 is <strong>nothing</strong> like BB10. It is a completely new OS built from the ground up.</p>
<p>Of course I get that. What I&#8217;m saying is that I&#8217;ve never been impressed with their work. So I have 0 hopes for BB10.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never owned a BlackBerry phone to date because I don&#8217;t like them at all but I plan on switching to BB10 on day one.</p>
<p>BB10 is nothing like their earlier phones.</p>
<p>You say that like you’ve used or even seen BB10 in action.</p>
<p>I <strong>have</strong> used BB10, and it&#8217;s impressive.</p>
<p>I expect it will be at least as disruptive in the media space as webOS was, except that RIM is both larger and more successful than 2009 era Palm (and more capable of getting the global distribution they need to ship lots of device).</p>
<p>The hysteria about webOS hit fever pitch after CES &#8212; iPhoneWorld was downright enraged at how much better webOS was than the iOS of the era.  BB10 will do that all over again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d use the example of Palm as a harbinger of success for a new platform.</p>
<p>Think beyond the superficial.</p>
<p>Palm&#8217;s failure was one of distribution, not technology.</p>
<p>Palm&#8217;s got technology, plus distribution.  Certainly, when people see BB10, they&#8217;ll have deja vu about the UX.</p>
<p>Whoops, make that &#8220;RIM&#8217;s got technology.&#8221;  Now you&#8217;ve messed up my brains. ;)</p>
<p>Palm was also a failure of technology.  They had some interesting concepts sure but the execution was not up to snuff.  That combined with the distribution problems killed them.</p>
<p>People have this rosy view of Palm that isn&#8217;t based on the reality of what WebOS was.  That plus the fact they sat on what made them initially popular well past its lifespan.</p>
<p>I had a Palm Pre and a Palm Pre 2.  Both were superior to the Android and iOS devices of the day in hardware, UI and user experience.</p>
<p>The original Pre was so far ahead of the iPhone 3G and 3GS that it took Apple years to catch up &#8212; arguably until iOS 6.</p>
<p>Ah, you bought one. That explains a lot :-)</p>
<p>LOL!</p>
<p>I have a Palm Pre GSM and a couple Apple Newton Messagepads.</p>
<p>I think both devices have been built up into cult icons, &#8220;soooooo ahead of their time&#8221;.  Years later, you pick them up and can&#8217;t see the magic that those there at the time had promised you.  We all take it for granted perhaps, but the rose glasses-ed Original Gangsters see nothing but miracles and glory.  You or I would see an incredibly low res screen, shitty ass build quality, bizarre mush green throughout the OS combined with ORANGE highlights&#8230;&#8230;.and a dead company.</p>
<p>They see &#8220;Apple and Google CHEATING, ganging up on my poor Palm Pre&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; :-)</p>
<blockquote>iPhoneWorld was downright enraged at how much better webOS was than the iOS of the era.</blockquote>
<p>This completely invalidates you entire post. WebOS was thoroughly inferior to iOS &#8212; it was absurdly sluggish in comparison and there was no third party apps worth a damn. Their idea of media synching was an iTunes hack pretending it was an iPod.  The whole enterprise was a big joke, which is why Palm went belly up, and it died at HP.</p>
<p>This was after CES but before the Pre was released, the sluggishness wasn&#8217;t so apparent then and if I remember correctly at the time, iOS did not have any apps or the App Store was in its infancy. Also keep in mind that at this time there was still no iOS multitasking, notification centre, etc.</p>
<p>Read some of the tech articles from that time period. There was a real tangible feeling after the CES reveal that webOS was a real game changer compared to iOS.</p>
<p>Your timelines are mixed up. The Pre was released at around the same time as the iPhone 3GS.</p>
<p>The Pre was first shown in January of 2009 at CES.  Most of the media opinion of the time was formed during the CES demo, not during the launch.</p>
<p>Apple had to accelerate development of the 3GS as a result of all of the press attention focused on the Pre at the time, which had the UX to beat for the mobile industry in 2009.</p>
<p>Actually, Palm&#8217;s media sync with iTunes was brilliant.  Apple, being a predatory monopolist, made it break &#8212; repeatedly &#8212; to protect their music monopoly.</p>
<p>After all, without the music monopoly, there was little reason to buy an iPhone.  At the time, Apple fans like yourself were insisting that multitasking, proper notifications, full HTML5 browsing and other details like that were all &#8220;nerd things that didn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;  webOS did them seamlessly.</p>
<p>Of course, now that Apple has caught up with Palm (finally) with iOS 6, all those same features are &#8220;essential.&#8221;</p>
<p>The very rage in your post at the mention of the name &#8220;Palm&#8221; sorta proves the webOS Derangement Syndrome that Apple users of the era had.  The very idea that Palm would DARE to try to compete with Apple &#8212; and release a better product &#8212; sent them into paroxysms of rage.  It still does, even years later!</p>
<p>Leaving aside the obviously inflammatory tone of your posts, I don&#8217;t see it myself. Palm (and their design)  have always been very Apple-ish (unsurprising, given the origins of the company) and generally admired by Apple fans.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got an original Palm Pre GSM, and you are not living in the real world!  They were always sluggish as hell (as Joshua Topolsky will tell you anyday), the software held back by atrocious hardware!  Mine had to be &#8220;activated&#8221; with HP servers, an unlocked device that needed some wacky activation that would only happen when I used a Vodafone NZ SIM card?  It didn&#8217;t work with my usual 2 Degrees sim or a borrowed Telecom card, it needed Vodafone or it simply wouldn&#8217;t do anything but emergency calls?!?!?!)</p>
<p>It took me two weeks to borrow a friends Voda sim, and in that time of exploration of what the device could do in that locked down state, I already had a screen wobble.  God only knows how it would have been with just a solid month of everyday use, &#8220;Oreo Effect&#8221; out the ass I bet!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been exceedingly careful with my devices, Im using my near new condition preordered iPhone 4 right now.</p>
<p>The Pre (and Pixi, and Veer, and Touchpad) were always slow, they were always sluggish, they were always made from the parts other manufacturers rejected.  Read up on the Touchpad history for example, the anecdotes from Palm engineers of &#8220;every time we found a camera chipset we wanted, we learnt Apple had bought out all the manufacturing lines&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p>RIM also has quite a few carriers on board, which was a huge factor in why Palm failed.</p>
<p>You do know that BB7 != BB10, right? They&#8217;re not even related.</p>
<p>Exactly.  BB10 is more different from BB7 than iOS is from BB7.  The only similarity is the fact that it will have the word &#8220;BlackBerry&#8221; written in places inside the OS.</p>
<p>Kind of an ignorant comment. More dogma than fact.</p>
<p>I see you missed this:  <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5974362/the-complete-blackberry-10-video-walkthrough-surprise-its-neat" target="_blank">http://gizmodo.com/5974362/the-complete-blackberry-10-video-walkthrough-surprise-its-neat</a></p>
<p>I tend never to visit that site. So yes, I did miss it.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>They should not be held to a higher standard than the other players in the market, where key players are about iterative upgrades and adding or not a freakin radio. This is a new OS with new possibilities, a chance for new/different content providers and choice.</p>
<p>People like you need to innovate in terms of analysis and comments.</p>
<p>Evidence says otherwise.  In taking on the two top players they need to be better than them.  It&#8217;s the 10% rule.  You need to have something that is 10% better than anything out there to grab market share.</p>
<p>Apple did this with iOS for example.  It was better than any other smartphone when it was released.</p>
<p>Evidence of a cliché? It&#8217;s about opinion &#8211; and I disagree.</p>
<p>You may disagree but the market has shown otherwise.</p>
<p>Why? What is so terrible about BB10? It is fast, fluid, will run apps you want, has a fast ui, good multitasking, and all in a small (or big in mid year) package with a 1280&#215;768 display. I don&#8217;t see the problem.</p>
<p>Love all the naysayers who have not used or even seen the full OS yet are so prophetic that it will fail. Can I have the Powerball numbers whilst you are at it.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how good it is &#8211; they may have the best OS and hardware ever created, but they&#8217;ve taken far, far too long to bring it to market. There is no way I&#8217;m going to leave my current ecosystem (Android)  for a platform with a very questionable future.  They are going to be fighting the battle for developers and customers that Google and Apple have been fighting for 5 years. Hell, even Microsoft  has a couple of years under their belt.</p>
<p>RIM will go into the business textbooks as one of the best examples what happens when you rest on your laurels and stick your head in the sand.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think RIM rested on their laurels — they just didn&#8217;t understand the threat. They were trying to play &#8217;50&#8217;s style basketball when the game had evolved. In other words, they worked hard, not smart. Resting on laurels implies that you didn&#8217;t even try. The recording industry rested on their laurels. RIM was just pigheaded and wrong-footed, believing their innovations in hardware were better than they were. Wishful thinking does make fools of us all.</p>
<p>RIM totally sat on what they had.  Look at all the snark they directed at Apple when the iPhone was introduced.  Look at the stuff they continued to say until the co-CEOs had to step down.</p>
<p>They willfully ignored the market for a long time thinking what they had was bulletproof.  They made half-hearted attempts to address it without actually bothering to understand what was happening.</p>
<p>They needed whole new OS to compete and you don&#8217;t get that over night. Ever asked yourself how long it took Apple to build iOS 1? And honestly, the first iPhone was a joke. No taskswitcher, no multitasking, no MMS, no sound profiles, proprietary all over. Shiny and overpriced.</p>
<p>Yes, because Kia/Hyundai have failed due to the time it took to reach the market /s</p>
<p>OH NOES MORE CAR ANALOGIES</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to play devil&#8217;s advocate.</p>
<p>The smartphone world was 10 years old by the time Apple entered it.  Yet they did very well.  Why?  Because it&#8217;s never &#8220;too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>The market is always open to innovation and disruption.</p>
<p>This is a much better analogy than thawkth&#8217;s above.</p>
<p>Ummm, Brian M didn&#8217;t present an analogy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine if you hate the car analogy, it&#8217;s not perfect but I see similarities so I went with it.</p>
<p>Its never too late, the only question is do you have enough money to last the course.</p>
<p>I agree completely that disruption is always possible, but how is BB10 going to disrupt anything?  The iPhone was radically different and better than BB, WinMo, Symbian and Palm. BB10 is just RIM (hopefully) catching up &#8212; but without the ecosystem and without the massive developer support, and without the resources to outspend everyone 10:1 on advertising the way Samsung did.   At best BB10 will be a speed bump on RIM&#8217;s road to bankruptcy or fire sale.</p>
<p>RIM has great Dev support actually. Also, they have one thing that Microsoft, their biggest competition for 3rd, doesn&#8217;t have: low end sales. They absolutely own in markets like Latin America, Aftica (particularly South Africa), and Indochina. They are doing quite well. The Blackberry brand is definitely still worth something. They have a chance to turn it around.</p>
<p>&#8220;The iPhone was radically different and better than BB, WinMo, Symbian and Palm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not in terms of functionality and &#8216;smartness&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;BB10 is just RIM (hopefully) catching up&#8221;</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve seen so far there are a few things in BB10 that iOS and Android should catch up to now. But I guess you don&#8217;t know, because you&#8217;ve only seen a few UI elements and videos without even thinking about it.</p>
<p>You failed to give us those lottery numbers with your prediction.</p>
<blockquote>There is no way I’m going to leave my current ecosystem (Android) </blockquote>
<p>So bring it with you! You do know BB 10 runs Android apps right?</p>
<p>He won&#8217;t be able to migrate the apps he bought on Google Play, but I don&#8217;t get the point anyway. BB10 will support Gmail natively, tv shows, movies, videos and music can all be copied over easily and there&#8217;ll be apps, too. Dropbox, Evernote, SkyDrive, a nav solution and whatever. I don&#8217;t get a clue about Android users complaining about ecosystems at all, cause Android isn&#8217;t proprietary, but it uses open standards and mass storage mode. So what&#8217;s the deal?</p>
<p>Finally, someone who&#8217;s played around with BB10 that can shut down the naysayers!</p>
<p>Well, to be fair to the naysayers — failure happens more than success — it&#8217;s just that the cost of failure is trivial compared to the reward of success. A more interesting question to me is whether the immediate failure that&#8217;s likely to occur will eliminate RIM from the hardware business or even business altogether.</p>
<p>If they can launch BB10 and not lose money on hardware, I&#8217;d consider that a relative success because they can fight to live another day, but most would probably consider that a failure. I give RIM a 50/50 chance of doing so. And if they <em>do</em> do so, the potential though unlikely reward of success becomes astronomical. This is the way the world works.</p>
<p>The naysayers are always right, except for when they&#8217;re wrong, usually ridiculously so.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d have to say that RIM has a little better chance than you are giving them.  They are in a good position when it comes to finances as well as outstanding supply of older phones.  Carriers have very little BB stock laying around, with many current BB customers coming up for upgrades (or a.ready due and waiting for BB10).  The initial push should be very good and profitable for RIM.  The concern come with the lull after the storm.  They just need to hope that the product lives up to the hype and they con sustain positive sales figures after the first quarter on the market.  If they can do that, they will be around for at least 3 more years, and probably many more.  If they can&#8217;t do that, they will be in a position to at least hang on with cash in the bank for 1-2 years before running out of cash.</p>
<p>Well, nobody actually knows, but I think believing RIM will</p>
<p>• Stay independent<br />
• Stay in the hardware business<br />
• Be very profitable doing so</p>
<p>is more unlikely than likely. If they can do the first two, the chance of breaking through with profitability is definitely good. However, those first two are not certain, hence my 50/50 estimate that is far more generous than most seem to think. They&#8217;ve got to execute well.</p>
<p>But they are going into a market that has already moved on.  At work we&#8217;ve dropped any new BB devices just letting legacy stuff age out because of a combination of cost to maintain and the fact android and iOS devices are better, cheaper, and in some areas easier to manage.</p>
<p>BB ecosystem get&#8217;s 1/10 verge points.</p>
<p>Then the windows 8 and WP8 users can be happy that they&#8217;re now second worst!</p>
<p>No. Unless I&#8217;m mistaken, last time they reviewed a BB phone they gave it 5 for ecosystem. When they reviewed the Playbook(2.0), they gave the ecosystem 3.</p>
<p>1/10 would be the chance you knew what you&#8217;re talking about or that you even cared to validate your statement.</p>
<p>BB10 can rind Android apps. It is probably on par with Windows Phone. Remember, all RIM has to do is allow the apk in their BBWorld and it is availible on all Blackberry devices.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Have they learned nothing from the mistakes of HTC? Christie Laude could they just die already. Why drag it out? Is it a morbid perversion by the Tech-Illuminati?</p>
<p>How are they like HTC? HTC lost profits because they never advertised enough. I have never seen a single ad by HTC on TV, whilst there&#8217;s countless ads by Samsung. Meanwhile, Blackberry have been working very hard on BB10, and advertising BB7 very little. BB10 is looking to be really fast and really smooth.</p>
<p>HTC&#8217;s problems are simply down to marketing at this point. But they began with over-saturation of the market.</p>
<p>I think RIM should stop making multiple SKU&#8217;s at this point. It works for Android because it&#8217;s open sourced software, but not in their case. One full touch, one qwerty&#8230;done.</p>
<p>I do think they need one high end and one low end version as well.  Their customer base is highly divided between high-end biz users in developed economies, and low end consumers in developing nations.  They can&#8217;t ignore either and hope to succeed.</p>
<p>Why do people on tech blogs use the retail jargon acronym &#8216;SKU&#8217; rather than the good old English words &#8216;model&#8217; or&#8217; product&#8217;? Genuinely curious.</p>
<p>BB10 runs Android natively, as long as the apps have been officially added to their app store (Blackberry World)</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t run 4.0 <i>yet</i> as far as I know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a BB fan, but I think BB10 has a chance to at least carve out a little niche market for itself. The multitasking looks really nice, and I dig the idea of the Hub as this talk-from-anywhere feature. Now, granted, they&#8217;re going to need some hefty third-party support, and that&#8217;ll be earned over time rather than just handed to them, but I&#8217;ll definitely be keeping my eye on the touchscreen model.</p>
<blockquote>I’m not a BB fan, but I think BB10 has a chance to at least carve out a little niche market for itself.</blockquote>
<p>The problem is it doesn&#8217;t need to carve out a little niche for itself. It&#8217;s digging/carving is a result of the hubris in the house that RIM built.  They aren&#8217;t forging a new path they are propping up their collapsed coliseum.</p>
<p>Beautiful imagery, thank you :-)</p>
<p>If I had my computer running here at my new house, I&#8217;d make a photoshop of Thorsten shrugging while the RIM branded bulldozers crash head on into one another in a firey wreck and pillars collapse further.</p>
<p>We are blessed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an iPhone 5 user switching too the full touch model</p>
<p>Cool story bro.</p>
<p>But really, this does make me a bit sad. I almost bought a blackberry curve back in the day, shockingly the clicking touchscreen was not as nice in the hand as my crazed 20 something mind thought it would be.</p>
<p>If they stick with the 10 they might make it out of this at lest as well as Nokia.</p>
<p>You mean the &#8220;Storm&#8221; with SurePress?</p>
<p>Sure sounds like you have a trustworthy opinion regarding &#8220;the 10&#8221;.</p>
<p>bb is now on the same shelf as cassette walkman.  revolutionary old.</p>
<p>from the just posted video, I think it looks very good.  not too thrilled with my galaxy s2, wish there were more windows phones at the low end with expandable memory for xbox music. seems nobody gets it completely right for me.</p>
<p>Yes, because Apple&#8217;s success in selling phones has been tied to six different models released in 12 months.</p>
<p>Really RIM? Are you just not paying ANY attention?</p>
<p>What about Samsungs success?</p>
<p>Samsung with infinite money, who sell every Non iPhone in the market?</p>
<p>They can afford to CRUSH every other phone maker right now, because once those are dead, they don&#8217;t bounce back.  When HTC has had it&#8217;s head fully torn off, now Motorola has finally emptied its bowels, now Nokia has been bought by Microsoft who can boast a whole two percent marketshare&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..then the world is Samsung&#8217;s for the next decade.</p>
<p>I stopped reading at &#8220;Nokia has been bought by Microsoft&#8221;. And I was being open-minded up &#8217;til then.</p>
<p>Because Nokia is SUCH an independent company now, right?  They can TOTALLY develop their own kickass OS, or sell Android devices at any time, yeah?</p>
<p>They are owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>~ owner of a new Nokia N9 which will soon have its brains flashed out, to dualboot Android ICS</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t owned by Microsoft. They&#8217;re being paid by Microsoft $250M per year. They&#8217;re also fighting an in ecosystem war with HTC, Samsung, and Huawei and are definitely coming out on top. Why? Because there&#8217;s fewer competitors. The Lumia 920 took 12 tech awards for 2012, and it&#8217;s been selling pretty well in a lot of places. Nokia still sells phones that aren&#8217;t Windows Phone, but they&#8217;re not any of their flagships. Heck, I don&#8217;t even like Nokia, I&#8217;m just indifferent.</p>
<p>250M USD per quarter in rent from Microsoft.  Meanwhile, they used to make over 8 billion Euro per QUARTER in 2007, the year the modern smartphone came out.</p>
<p>They are laying off tens of thousands, they are selling their house&#8230;&#8230;..they are screwed.  They can no longer even dream of making ONE billion bucks per quarter, let alone ten billion per quarter.</p>
<p>The N9 won design awards, where did that get them?</p>
<p>They are still coasting on its design two years later, and its yet to produce a hit product, four near identical flagships on.</p>
<p>Did he ever say they were doing as good as before? Nokia being exclusive to Microsoft is a gamble worth taking. Windows Phone will basically never die because Microsoft has the money to keep it going. If it succeeds, Nokia has the best chance at riding the wave with it because they have the most freedom with WP8. They also get money from MS to help tide them over. Do you think they would be any better with Android?</p>
<blockquote>&quot; Windows Phone will basically never die because Microsoft has the money to keep it going.&quot;</blockquote>
<p>In that case, expect the spectacle to last &#8220;basically [forever]&#8221;, just like Palm and then HP went on and on and on, giving us all a good laugh every single week at their new zany adventure into oblivion&#8230;&#8230;except, as you state, Microsoft will keep throwing good money after bad, and our grand children will die seeing MCRSFT ZunePhone 12 on a whopping 3% marketshare &#8211; still technically alive!<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus">Prometheus</a> &#8211; not just a sci fi movie :-)</p>
<p>&#8220;The punishment of Prometheus as a consequence of the theft is a major theme of his mythology, and is a popular subject of both ancient and modern art. Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, sentenced the Titan to eternal torment for his transgression. The immortal Prometheus was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle, the emblem of Zeus, was sent to feed on his liver, only to have it grow back to be eaten again the next day. &quot;</p>

<p>I love how you more often that not make crap up in your posts for the sake of your irrational, and in more cases than not, fanboy based arguments. In November msft was talking about WP sales being up <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/11/29/microsoft_claims_winphone_sales_up_4x/">300% over last year</a>. And now in January they&#8217;re talking about sales being up <a href="http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-phone-sales-up-5x-during-christmas-week-2012-compared-to-2011">400% over last year</a>?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/26/2736104/nokia-quarterly-results-q4-2011">So just looking at nokias financials for example</a> (and this is a lot of extrapolation just to prove a point). If they sold 1 million Lumias in Q4 last year (divided equally to 333k per month), <strong><em>if </em></strong>they got that same 4x and 5x bump that&#8217;d be a boost to 1.33 million per month in Nov, then 1.66 million in Dec, YoY.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s throwing good money after bad to you? Unless you&#8217;re in the market of forecasting growth rates over the next 12-24 months, your statement has no base in reality.</p>
<p>You never tried to refute my last question so I must be right. Windows Phone was the best chance for Nokia. You are also saying that Microsoft will never succeed in this post. Where is that crystal ball again?</p>
<p>Understand that you don&#8217;t need your own OS to be successful. Nokia made a tough, but right choice.</p>
<p>Absolutely, you don&#8217;t need your own OS, you need Googles OS if you want to be anything but fourth behind Zombie RIM.</p>
<p>No you don&#8217;t. Samsung is the only successful OEM for Android because they have the money. &#8220;&#8230;behind zombie RIM&#8221;. Ok, you are obviously one of those cynical people who think that RIM is &#8220;dead&#8221; and &quot; has no chance&quot;. Can I have some lottery numbers? I don&#8217;t know what you use but you obviously know everything about the future. /s Seriously, do us all a favor and shut up. Going the way that is already successful for some isn&#8217;t the way to go for HTC, Nokia, and RIM. They need to either rid the wave of another OS or create their own. Samsung has the mindshare for Android phones because they advertise the heck out of it.</p>
<p>How can you not get it?</p>
<p>Samsung has killed the competition, they advertise like hell, with superior products, which launch every twenty minutes.  Compare this to RIM who&#8217;ve been promising SOMETHING at least competitive with the 2007 iPhone since&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.2009?  They are still not even close.</p>
<p>Samsung has eaten the other OEM&#8217;s alive, through marketing and relentless pace.  And both only increase for them, they spend even MORE on advertising, which makes them even MORE money, so they sell even MORE devices, which means people see MORE people with Samsung devices, and so MORE sell, so they can afford to advertise them MORE, and so they sell even MORE&#8230;&#8230;..see how this goes?</p>
<p>Compare that to HTC, Nokia and RIM.  Nothing, and where are they today?</p>
<p>The Vergecast has already provided you with the answer &#8211; the race doesnt have to be over before you can pretty much predict the winner.  Years ago we saw the Palm car crash off the road, even though WebOS is &#8220;technically still alive!&#8221; right now, as Open WebOS&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;yeah, because I&#8217;m SURE someone will totally snatch that up, and start a new WebOS ecosystem any minute now, right? :-)</p>
<p>I cant give your the lottery numbers, gambling is silly.</p>
<p>But ANYONE could see how dead RIM was THREE YEARS AGO, and Nokia put themselves in the same position.  Nokia could have been a someone, they WERE a someone, the biggest freaking phone maker in the world&#8230;..until Samsung utterly slaughtered them.   They are not coming back, not even in the slightest degree.  You wont so much as get a pulse out of them now, when they used to have their N95 featured in almost every ad here in New Zealand.  Anything phone related, if the advertiser wanted a &#8220;cool phone&#8221; for a &#8220;young, professional go-getter&#8221;, he or she had a N95, which they pulled out of their designer jeans while laughing with their friends.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m moving house at the moment, just made a new greenhouse for my Hen Friends to live in :-)</p>
<p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/580495_4805947503204_485531723_n.jpg" /></p>
<p>When I have home internet available, I&#8217;ll flash my newly arrived Nokia N9 with Android, the way it should have been for Nokia.  I&#8217;ll make a nice big forum post with lots of photos, and some further of my spot on predictions ;-)</p>
<p>No, the fact that you think that Samsung is basically immortal and that nobody will ever challenge them is absurd. The Q4 results alone for Nokia already disprove your point. At the very least they can become like the other Android OEM&#8217;s and stay profitable. While your assertions of how great Samsung is <strong>in smartphones</strong> is correct, there is still a lot left to do. We have barely scratched the surface with wearable tech like smart watches and glasses. Nokia, RIM (more likely Blackberry), they have brand recognition then most anyways. Just because Samsung is on top doesn&#8217;t mean they won!</p>
<p>Now I want to go back and touch on that first part. The fact that you don&#8217;t understand subjectivity alone shows you don&#8217;t know what you are talking about. Also the fact that you pointed me to one of the 2 podcasts by this site also shows you don&#8217;t know what you are talking about. The Verge staff is extremely hostile to RIM in general and trash Nokia every other week. I know this is a massive generalization, but just last episode in the Mobile Podcast they trashed Blackberry! They said that &#8220;nobody wants a physical keyboard&#8221; even though one of the people present wanted one!</p>
<p>Look, just because Samsung is on top right now doesn&#8217;t mean they will stay there forever. Just because you think RIM is &#8220;dead&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s true. You do realize that RIM has 70%+ marketshare in South Africa right now? They have numbers like that in a lot of developing nations. Their subscriber base <strong>just</strong> went down for the first time, <strong>ever</strong>. They are quite financially stable right now. They still manage to turn a profit in 2012 even though they didn&#8217;t release <strong>one</strong> new phone. Get the picture? Everybody can clearly see that obviously can&#8217;t account subjectivity into your posts and assume that what you think is what everybody thinks.</p>
<p>One question: do you want RIM, Nokia, Windows Phone, BB10, etc to all die? If so, your an idiot&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;.yes, Blackberry is popular in very, very poor parts of the world (AND apparently South Africa, a country that many of my friends are from and which I would like to visit one day)&#8230;&#8230;.but you do realise that people in &#8220;developing nations&#8221; as you&#8217;ve mentioned get what the developed world has used for years&#8230;.right?</p>
<p>Do you really think they want Blackberry 7 devices forever?  No, in a years time, they will all be on Android devices, and RIM will simply be as close to dead as to not make a difference.</p>
<p>I dont WANT RIM or Nokia to die, but look at them, they HAVE died, they have not been relevant since 2008 or so.  They didnt matter in 2012, and 2013 certainly doesnt look any different.</p>
<p>Um, then why haven&#8217;t they bought an older iPhone or an older Android flagship already? They currently are selling BB7 phones there. When they &#8220;don&#8217;t want BB7 phones anymore&#8221;, you think that RIM wouldn&#8217;t offer something else to them? By then current BB10 phones would be that price. They have an incentive to stay with RIM because all their friends use BBM to communicate because of the cost.</p>
<p>They have not died. They are still in business, they have good carrier relations, they have carrier excitement behind their devices, I would say they have the second if not best chance of any potential &#8220;3rd platform&#8221;. They have a lot if things going for them.</p>
<p>Remember those &#8220;analysts&#8221; who claimed RIM wouldn&#8217;t survive till the New Year? They came out and said that RIM is doing better then expected. Did you see Nokia&#8217;s earnings report? They are making progress. This won&#8217;t be a dramatic change where they get 50% in the US. However, leveraging where they still have a good brand (which is more then you think, in the UK they have the younger generation), they can slowly make their way.</p>
<p>LOL.</p>
<p>Also, we have already been over this. Android for Nokia would have solved nothing&#8230;</p>
<p>it would have given them a CHANCE to solve everything&#8230;..instead they went the no-hope route.</p>
<p>No they wouldn&#8217;t have. Samsung has the mindshare right now for Android. The only chance they have to be successful is to ride a wave from a new platform. They will continue to get money from Microsoft to help get them back on their feet.</p>
<p>Also, I am not going to bother replying to that other comment. Seriously, &#8220;LOL&#8221;? No response of any substance typically means you are ceding your point due to lack of an argument.</p>
<p>There Is No Third Platform.</p>
<p>How can you not see that?</p>
<p>You dont want to be some &#8220;RC Cola&#8221; in a Coke VS Pepsi world. <a href="http://www.autolpg.co.nz/"> Statistically nobody buys LPG in a Petrol VS Diesel planet.</a>  What kind of marketshare does desktop Linux have against Windows VS Mac?</p>
<p>Repeat after me, Every Non iPhone is an Android Device.</p>
<p>14.3 million. That is one OEM: Nokia. 14.3 million users are out there on Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Where is your crystal ball? You have yet to show me. You <strong>don&#8217;t know</strong>. Say that with me, you <strong>don&#8217;t know</strong>. You <strong>don&#8217;t know</strong>.</p>
<p>That last statement is also incorrect. That implies that no other phone currently exists.</p>
<p>iOS and Android are not immortal, they <strong>can</strong> be dethroned. There <strong>will</strong> be a contender that <strong>will</strong> dethrone them. It <strong>may not</strong> be BB10, Windows Phone, or Ubuntu, though one <strong>will</strong> arise. You need to get that in your head. These smaller platforms will likely make apps compatible across multiple platforms. They will come up with new and innovative ideas, ideas that we <strong>want</strong>. The fact that you seem to not support any third platform and actively spew <strong>lies</strong> that show that you <strong>want</strong> a duopoly.</p>
<p>LOL!</p>
<p>Samsung is predicted 500 million Samsung phones sold in 2013, and I would bet they will be close as heck.  The best part about predictions from winners is that they will soon be proved &#8211; no waiting for &#8220;the next version which will totally catchup&#8221;, we will know the current Samsung sales pace in a month or two, and will be able to accurately follow along from there.</p>
<p>Over 500 million sales from ONE manufacturer, and you talk of a whole platforms store brand (Microsoft owns Nokia) as being a great hit with a dismal 14.3M!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll even round up for you, 15 million, NO!  20 million!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still not even the slightest worry for the mainstream powerhouses :-D</p>
<p>So you think they should give up now simply because they have a slow start? I am sorry if I thought you had more intelligence then that. Also, Microsoft does <strong>not</strong> own Nokia. You act as if they do, but they don&#8217;t. Once again you are acting as if Samsung is immortal because of where they are at right now. There will be no company that lives forever and that stays on top forever. If you can&#8217;t understand that, there is no hope for you ever understanding how the market works. So just stop talking as you clearly don&#8217;t understand how stuff works. Just because a company starts off slow doesn&#8217;t mean they will stay at that level.</p>
<p>They are not the same company they don&#8217;t have the customer demographic therefore they can&#8217;t use the same strategy.<br />
Apple has mainly aimed for high-end consumer market, that&#8217;s their main focus, they started to leave the last generation phone on the market to appease the mid to low-end. But their new phones have always been high-end consumers.</p>
<p>Rim is business centric, but they have success in the consumer space and emerging markets. THey have multiple demographics to hit, hence multiple products.</p>
<p>Stop making sense in the internet!!!!!</p>
<p>Historically maybe but they&#8217;ve lost the business side.  Apple is also going after both consumer and enterprise markets now so you argument is flawed.  If you look at the enterprise tools for iOS you can see the push.</p>
<p>RIM can still target business users with a phone and target the consumer flagship market with another, then target the budget market with another, and so on. RIM needs to satisfy their current demographic (developing markets) with cheaper hardware. They also need to satisfy the high end consumer market in major markets. Apple&#8217;s main demographic doesn&#8217;t include these low end markets. Conformity isn&#8217;t the solution for RIM&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;but they’ve lost the business side.&#8221;</p>

Richard Piasentin, US Managing Director RIM:<br />
&#8220;&#8230;we do maintain presence in 90% of the Fortune 1,000 companies, and they are upgrading at a significant rate to our BlackBerry 7 portfolio&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://n4bb.com/interview-rims-managing-director-richard-piasentin-tells-all-touch-blackberry-10-device-releasing-bringing-revolution/" target="_blank">http://n4bb.com/interview-rims-managing-director-richard-piasentin-tells-all-touch-blackberry-10-device-releasing-bringing-revolution/</a></p>
<p>Stop talking bullshit.</p>
<p>Kind of an ignorant comment.</p>
<p>Did you wilfully decide to ignore Samsungs wide range of phones?</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not talking about Samsung here. Samsung has capital coming out of their ass, and can throw lots of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. RIM is in its death throes, and needs to have a clear winner to survive and get developers to make apps for the platform. They don&#8217;t have the luxury of capital, market share, or a thriving Android ecosystem that Samsung does.</p>
<p>The only reason RIM lasted to this release date is because of their low end phones selling very well in developing markets, something Apple can&#8217;t do.  Their largest customer base is poor people in developing countries and there next largest group is rich business people.  They NEED to have a high end and a low end option of each style of phone they offer.</p>
<p>Kids round my way dont use iPhones, the use BB&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I ask where you are located?</p>
<p>Keep in mind RIM has 70%+ marketshare in markets like South Africa.</p>
<p>RIM has $2.9 billion in the bank and has been profitable, that&#8217;s far from dead.</p>
<p>UK.</p>
<p>Actually Apple does have 3 devices at different prices points. So why should it be any different for RIM??</p>
<p>BlackBerry will do fine in enterprise and retake back the companies that switched to iPhones. Consumers may be a harder sell though.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right about consumers, but I think it&#8217;s a harder sell to enterprise than you&#8217;re making it out to be. Look how long it has taken for many companies to move away from BB &#8211; those companies are unlikely to be in any hurry to jump back aboard a clearly sinking ship.</p>
<p>You have to remember that it took years for Apple to invade the enterprise(they are still not  that deep in it) And they did eventually started moving there because of employee/consumer demand. If they don&#8217;t win consumers over enterprises that switched over won&#8217;t be so easy to jump on board :) Companies are really bad and really slow at change</p>
<p>And they&#8217;ve spent five years moving to iOS and Android&#8230;&#8230;..so why would they switch on a dime and crawl back to a magically revitalised RIM now?</p>
<p>Maybe three years ago, but not now.</p>
<p>3 words: BlackBerry enterprise server</p>
<p>Which is expensive and a paint to maintain compared to how you do it on android or iOS.  With iOS you can either just activate ActiveSync or use something like GOOD which is simple to setup.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t really aim at enterprise until relatively recently due to customer demand.  And from what I am seeing in the enterprise RIM is not well liked and seen as expensive and old.</p>
<p>Good is really a horrible solution. It feels like you&#8217;re trying to glue feathers to your ass and call yourself a duck. When BlackBerry is the duct itself.  It is a clumsy, battery draining, bad imitation of blackberry.</p>
<blockquote>Which is expensive and a paint to maintain compared to how you do it on android or iOS. With iOS you can either just activate ActiveSync or use something like GOOD which is simple to setup.</blockquote>
<p>Good Lord what are you talking about? Comparing connecting an iOS or Android device to an Exchange server via ActiveSync to a BES is like comparing a security guard to a battalion of Marines. A better comparison would be to Active Directory. And unless your a large enterprise the <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/business/software/besx.html" target="new">BES Express</a> works fine and is free!</p>
<p>GOOD is so poor.</p>
<p>I just say this: BlackBerry Mobile Fusion. Heard of it?</p>
<p>..one for each customer.</p>
<p>bam.</p>
<p>6? What research told them that its a good idea to release 6 different models?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m betting it&#8217;s mostly exclusive deals with carriers.</p>
<p>They have confirmed that there are NO exclusive deals with carriers.</p>
<p>&#8220;RIM reportedly has no exclusive carrier agreements in place&#8221;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&#8220;They have confirmed that there are NO exclusive deals with carriers&#8221;</p>
<p>are two totally different things</p>
<p>Umm, I don&#8217;t know, maybe they studied Samsung, and Apple, and opted for something in between?</p>
<p>Maybe they just rolled a dice.</p>
<p>Maybe they just have some marketing experts in place who understand their job and are working on a certain goal with a certain strategy.</p>
<p>Different form factors.  You could have at least read Webran61&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s almost certainly going to be slab, but they are known for QWERTY candybars more, so probably one of them.<br />
Then you could say there is the high, middle and low end.<br />
Keep in mind RIM are doing well in less developed countries and in the UK at least sell well with those who generally can&#8217;t afford the high end devices.</p>
<p>So far as we know, they&#8217;re launching a touch model first, then a keyboard and touch, then another one that may be a slider touch. The rest are unknown however.</p>
<p>The touch is the Z10, also known as the L-Series and London while in development. The keyboard and touch is the X10, also known as the N-Series and Nevada while in development. The slider is only known as the Milan so far.</p>
<p>These aren&#8217;t all at once. Besides, they have to satisfy the low end markets they currently cater to, the high end markets for higher profit margins, and then the business market to utilize their BES assets. They will probably do a low and high end keyboard and all touch (4), a portrait slider keyboard (1), and a a bigger all touch (1). That is 6. 3 on that list are already rumored to be coming.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been holding off buying a Windows Phone just to see what they&#8217;re offering. What I really want to see is if they&#8217;ll be price competitive.</p>
<p>RIM haters crack me up.  According to them, RIM &#8220;wasn&#8217;t going to make it through 2012,&#8221; and instead, they sold about 7 million older devices last quarter and booked a quarterly profit.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t they only release one new device as well last year?  If anything, that&#8217;s very good considering.  Now if BBOS 10 wasn&#8217;t coming out this year, I could see a big problem, but that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t release ANY new devices last year.  All the BB7 devices were from late 2011.  They still will have sold over 30 million devices in 2012&#8230; not bad for a &#8220;dead ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>And 10 is all-new (and much more compelling).  With any luck, they&#8217;ll land all their loyalists who bought last year, plus a bunch of other people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in my mid 30s&#8230; old enough to remember when Apple was &#8220;the dead company&#8221; and the jokes were about &#8220;do you think Apple will sell three or five iMacs?&#8221;  I think RIM&#8217;s got more going for them now than Apple did in 1998&#8230;</p>
<p>Everyone loves a come back. Ill getting a z10 from launch. Goodbye iPhone 5</p>
<p>I know, I just don&#8217;t get how they are so blind in hating RIM. Even some of The Verge staff has some very obvious &#8220;prejudice&#8221; if you will against RIM&#8230;</p>
<p>6 devices?</p>
<p>Small, Medium, Large&#8230; with or without keyboard. Sounds pretty smart if that&#8217;s their plan.</p>
<p>And S/M/L can be interpreted in GabeN-speak of &#8220;Good, Better, Best&#8221; as well</p>
<p>have luck&#8230;<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>How about some release dates?</p>
<p>That device might look nicer without the case, oh wait&#8230;</p>
<p>It does look nicer without the developer shell.</p>
<p>Too late. Already ordered my Xperia Z.</p>
<p>Why did you buy a Sony phone?</p>
<p>He thought Sony is still cool.</p>
<p>OHBURN</p>
<p>That fact that you buy phones cause &#8220;so cool&#8221; is worse then his Sony purchase.</p>
<p>Maybe because he likes what they did? Not all stereotypes about specific brands are try you know?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t live in the U.S. therefore I have a much better phone catalog to select from and I&#8217;m not tied to one stupid specific carrier with different bands than others and crappy ass plans.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.passenlaw.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/burn-injury.jpg" /></p>
<p>Because he wanted a 5&quot; 1080p screen. The rest is irrelevant these days.</p>
<p>Why do people assume Blackberry needs a high marketshare to be successful?</p>
<p>If the slim down, they can probably survive decently with a tiny marketshare. After all, does Ferrari have a high marketshare? are they successful?</p>
<p>PS: six models probably includes at least 2 cameraless variations. Probably what happens is they launch 2 models early 2013, and a variation of one of the models for 3 models total early 2013. Repeat for later 2013</p>
<blockquote>Why do people assume Blackberry needs a high marketshare to be successful?</blockquote>
<p>Partly because now more than ever, the ecosystem is a big part of what you are buying into. In the POC world it is a big part of what kept people buying Windows or even a Mac. If BB10 suffers a low adoption rate, the app makers won&#8217;t make apps for it. No apps makes BB10 a dull OS.</p>
<p>No, the ecosystem factor is weakening and will weaken further as devs try to maximize income from their intial investment &#8211; features, services, difference and possibly one device with a physical kb is what this is about. And something for the non US market.</p>
<p>How many apps do people really need?  With good social integration, there is less need for some social apps and there will obviously be browser, so most things will be covered.</p>
<p>If things like wireless payment with smartphones was widespread and OS specific, I could see a problem; but that isn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t reveal my sources, but here&#8217;s an exclusive look at one of the hot new models.  Note the return of the click wheel, and over-sized tracking ball, among other advanced features.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dh98DFt4QL8/UOoJtLYr42I/AAAAAAAACBk/e0qx6pq5xQs/s692/IMAG0256.jpg" /></p>
<p>At least we can see how an average dead RIM employee look like.</p>
<p>Six epic fails. Not bad.</p>
<p>I think RIM has actually &#8211; finally  &#8211; done their homework on this one.  The segmented nature of their market is what&#8217;s kept them alive through the last few years (+ service revs)&#8230; also offers lots of growth potential (at least in volume if not margins).  They at least need something high-end and entry-level (mid-range&#8230; maybe).  If you account for 3 form-factors to suit all BB-types &#8211; all-touch, qwerty, &amp; slider&#8230;.  3 styles x 2 models/style = 6 devices. If you know BB and RIM&#8217;s current business, this makes good sense.</p>
<p>I personally think that this strategy is going to come back and bite them in the ass. That is a developer&#8217;s hell.</p>
<p>I have a crazy idea, make one really good berry that people might want to buy, <br />
and an upgraded one at end of the year, but continue selling the older model as midrange.</p>
<p>Its a great business model&#8230; for Apple (oh wait??<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852418/wsj-low-cost-iphone-could-come-this-year">Low-cost iPhone could come this year</a>)</p>
<p>I remember the last time that Apple declared it was going to release a &#8220;low cost device.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was called the &#8220;Macintosh Performa.&#8221;  And just about everyone who saw one, used one, or owned one has desperately tried to forget it.</p>
<p>You have to remember Apple never declares these things! It&#8217;s just stupid analysts and bloggers bullshitting and making these rumors every single week. Apple&#8217;s quiet for the entire year except for like 7days during their product announcements.</p>
<p>This story is recycled every year.  You know what the &#8220;low cost&#8221; one is?  The older model they put for $99 on contract or the free even older one.</p>
<p>I hope this succeeds. I&#8217;d rather see this become the third major mobile OS, not Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Please please please release a portrait slider again!! :D The Torch&#8217;s form factor is perfect IMHO, it was just let down by crappy software and internals.</p>
<p>I recommend you to search up the &#8220;Blackberry Milan&#8221;.</p>
<p>This just looks like a Droid X running 2.3. What a useless company.</p>
<p>Bring them on.  If different models mean more people jump on the platform, then I say go for it.</p>
<p>A bit of a lazy strategy from the business standpoint. Using the shotgun approach to finding a phone that sticks is going to cost them quite a bit of money (some will flop, others will succeed) &#8211; something they do not have a surplus of. Not only will 6 phones be confusing for customers, this approach will also make it somewhat frustrating and cumbersome for app developers who are new to the platform. If the platform desperately needs app developers (and RIM needs them more than anyone right about now), RIM needs to make it easy for developers to thrive on it. Making 6 different devices with different hardware and different layouts (QWERTY and Touchscreen) does not help developers at all. We can only wait and see what actually happens, but in my opinion this is the wrong approach and RIM would have been much better off releasing one or two phones with great SDKs.</p>
<p>Finally BB will be a Smartphone.. Dev Alpha kind of impressed me ..</p>
<p>BGR? Heh</p>
<p>Darn no edit button</p>
<p>Anyway, looks like a great improvement but I imagine it&#8217;ll fall short. Guess we&#8217;ll see..</p>
<p>Is that Siri? Apple suing in 3&#8230;2&#8230;1&#8230;</p>
<p>Well they pretty much took the icon one-to-one. Maybe they were &#8220;inspired&#8221; by it.</p>
<p>But the thing you are talking about is not protected by patents.</p>
<p>&#8230; I think.</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s been patented by Apple! <br />
<a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/11/27/apple-siri-mic-lightning-widgets/" target="_blank">http://www.idownloadblog.com/2012/11/27/apple-siri-mic-lightning-widgets/</a></p>
<p>Well, you are right.</p>

Sure, only a few are usable, but there are definitely alternatives.</p>
<p>This patent will end up being invalidated. Look at android gingerbread voice actions (predating siri)</p>
<p><img src="http://img.gadgetian.com/Samsung-Google-Nexus-S-Android-2.3.6-Update.jpg" /></p>
<p>Each of the icons for iOS, BB, and Android are slightly different, probably different enough to avoid lawsuits.</p>
<p>BB has a more sloping/contoured base<br />
Android has a semicircle mic holder, while iOS&#8217; goes up further and straightens out.</p>
<p>True. For the record, I don&#8217;t think anybody should be suing anybody over something that dumb. But I do think it is dumb when you hear the apple fan boys saying that the android voice icon copied siri because they switched to a red circle. I would say the near identical icon is more of a plagerization than the circle.</p>
<p>The first thing I saw when I looked at the comments was a million rants about how they copied siri.. What they should have been saying is they copied android. But android fans are typically so sick of the stupid patent wars that they would likely not say that.</p>
<p>Keeping with Apple&#8217;s mantra: If it can be patented, patent the hell out of it.</p>
<p>I guess they&#8217;re just patenting their design for the icon! You do realize microsoft also had patents for its icons and other designs too!</p>
<p>Yes but nobody wanted to copy it anway.</p>
<p><strong>duck and cover</strong></p>
<p>As opposed to all other tech companies who don&#8217;t patent stuff right?</p>
<p>Eh, the square might hamper that a bit.</p>
<p>You do realize that android was using that icon long before Apple right?</p>
<p>Depends on who powers it, Nuance, Vlingo guys or RIM and if its the latter, then its a question of implementation</p>
<p>It&#8217;s powered by AT&amp;T&#8217;s Watson.  Apple would be suing AT&amp;T.  I don&#8217;t think even Apple would be arrogant enough to sue their big customer.</p>
<p>is this in the BB10 code? Just curious as to your source.</p>
<p>qnxauto.blogspot.com &#8211; they talked about it in the CAR and CAR 2 platforms.  You should be able to search for the video easily on the site.</p>
<p>I see it well in that case,  they cant be sued for the implementation since AT&amp;T Watson has been about for 2 decades.</p>
<p>The device is made by RIM, ergo they&#8217;d have to sue RIM.</p>
<p>Unlike other phone manufacturers, Apple doesn&#8217;t think carriers are their customers &#8211; probably their biggest advantage.</p>
<p>Hive minded simpleton comments are awesome.</p>
<p>It kinda looks like what I imagine Siri imitated by Android would look like.</p>
<p>I would rather a Google Now imitation personally, love that on my Android when those cards pop with needed info. I chill in the office until the time to go home is reasonable via traffic conditions.</p>
<p>This cost RIM almost nothing to make &#8211; they just had to integrate AT&amp;T&#8217;s Watson API.  It&#8217;s a smart use of money IMO.  In contrast, Apple bought a company to make Siri.  And when it comes to performance, Watson could very likely be better than Siri, since it&#8217;s been around for 20 years, and most likely works better with 3rd party apps than Siri.</p>
<p>A piece of software existing for 20 years says nothing about how well it will work with current 3rd party apps.</p>
<p>That would be S Voice on Samsung phones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kinda nitpicking here, but neither this nor Siri is a dictation app — these are voice powered assistants.</p>
<blockquote>I’m kinda nitpicking here, but neither this nor Siri is a dictation app</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m kinda nitpicking here, but Siri does do dictation (though it&#8217;s easier to just use the dictation function directly instead of going through Siri).</p>
<p>Voice dictation&#8230;maybe we should embrace Apple boosting the popularity of all these already implanted functions, so the masses will jump on board, and we can all enjoy these freshly polished geek fantasies become reality. I dunno if I&#8217;m feeling supportive or cynical.</p>
<p>Broken source link.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ok guys&#8230; so we&#8217;re going to make something that is basically exactly Siri, but we want it to look like absolute crap&#8230; give us your worst ideas&#8221;</p>
<p>For real, RIM? That top screenshot looks like the current Facebook app, except the design is worse, the icons are outdated, and just&#8230; I hate everything about this. Not that it REALLY matters to me because I&#8217;d never even dream of buying one, but I gotta think there&#8217;s a lot of disappointed BB fans out there.</p>
<p>Maybe this is the &#8220;business&#8221; look.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a business that still runs Windows 95 and communicates through only faxes, then yes, perhaps :P</p>
<p>windows 95 still looks better than that linen and stitched leather crap on iOS</p>
<p>Spoken like someone that doesn&#8217;t spend his days interacting with iOS.</p>
<p>Yeah, the fonts are ugly! I wonder how they utilized the expertise of the Swedish design firm TAT! And that voice dictation app has that traditional ugly cyan blue blackberry style color!</p>
<p>Assuming these are real, I just absolutely cannot comprehend how their design team came up with this and was like WOO NAILED IT!</p>
<p>why not?<br />
this is <em>RIM</em> we&#8217;re taking about</p>
<p>The reason why it&#8217;s black is to save battery.  When the screen is black the LCD isn&#8217;t on.  There&#8217;s been a ton of BB 10 design art leaked that specifically said something like they chose a dark theme to save battery.</p>
<p>I think that was only meant in regards to the presumably OLED-equipped N-Series.</p>
<p>That would apply to OLED tech, not LCD. LCD saves battery on whiter colors in comparison to OLED. OLED doesn&#8217;t have a backlight, so it turns the pixels off for blacks, this saving power.</p>
<p>Re-imagined? Where? This is just blent copy of iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Your Mom is just a blent copy of iOS and Android.</p>
<p>You&#8217;r mom is calling you to come upstairs. Dinner is ready.</p>
<p>Reading your other comments, it appears you love Blackberry. Here I thought you were being ironic.</p>
<p>The thing is: define copy. What did RIM copy here? There are things that are standard (and that is good as you don&#8217;t have to re-invent the wheel), there are things that have to be re-imagined. So what parts of that OS do you mean with &#8220;copy&#8221;? There is an app-drawer in BlackBerry 10 which is a simple icon grid with multiple pages you can scroll through horizontally. Yeah, like in iOS. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s intuitive, it&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s a standard way of showing installed apps. No need for a re-imagination here, Phones from 15 years ago already had icon grids, that was called &#8216;menu&#8217;. In BB10 you can additionally flick through the pages fast by swiping the finger over the page numbers at the bottom. Perfect. What else do we have? Oh, a voice controlled digital assistant. Well, today&#8217;s phones NEED this feature like they need a camera or a web browser. They implemented it. Whats&#8217;s the deal? Facebook and Twitter look like the ones on iOS. Microsoft Office on a Mac looks the same like on Windows. What&#8217;s the deal? What really counts, is, what differentiates this OS from the others on the market. And dude, there&#8217;s much of it. It&#8217;s the way you control it with gestures, it&#8217;s the way you communicate through the HUB, it&#8217;s the way use it by navigating through Active Frames (which don&#8217;t have anything to do with Live Tiles nor Widgets), it&#8217;s the QNX kernel, it&#8217;s the keyboard, it&#8217;s the browser performance and at least it&#8217;s what&#8217;s under the hood, it&#8217;s what third party developers can do with it: Invocation Framework. But I see, you don&#8217;t have any clue what I&#8217;m talking about. Why? Because you&#8217;ve just seen a few damn screenshots of the OS and you think you can judge the OS based on these graphics alone, like so many others. But sorry sir, this is plain stupid.</p>
<p>If you truly think this is a copy of iOS an Android, everything must be! Explain to me, where exactly is their imitations?</p>
<p>The source link doesn&#8217;t appear to work. I clicked through to BGR to get it from them.</p>
<p>Definitely like what I see so far.  Can&#8217;t wait until January 30th for the big reveal!</p>
<p>It shows a lot more polish than earlier screenshots, which is reassuring.</p>
<p>oh god. what was the first screenshot then? this is ugly</p>
<p>I wish RIM luck, but I can&#8217;t help thinking it is too late to get into the increasingly 2 horse OS race.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait too see it!</p>
<p>shouldn&#8217;t it be &#8220;What can I do you for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nope. It is correct.</p>
<p>Power on top, volume rocker top left?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certainly intrigued with the overall product.</p>
<p>Power on top&#8230; WHY?!  Power on the right near the top is where it should be with these sizable phones, only Samsung and Nokia seem to get it!</p>
<p>yep, its like these people have never actually used a 4+ inch phone.  Switching to other phones from a nexus 4 / galaxy nexus feels so cumbersome due to the awkward power button locations</p>
<p>Exactly, I moved from a Focus to the 8X, when it comes to the power button location the switch just feels wrong and awkward.  They really need to do some usability studies on these things.</p>
<p>I cannot believe we are having a debate on the location of the power button&#8230;.If any physical button wakes the phone, who cares where the power button is</p>
<p>This will be interesting to see what reaction will be to this phone &#8211; If the launch event includes immediate shipping of a new phone &#8211; RIM would not really be that far behind MS, and the battle for third place could be a real fight&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about comfort. I want to be able to turn off the screen of my device without awkwardly having to move fingers around.</p>
<p>maybe you should get a phone designed for regular people hands.</p>
<p>Such as every Samsung or Nokia with the power on the side.</p>
<p>You Pic scare me everytime</p>
<p>Regular people&#8217;s hands &#8211; that excludes iPhone4/4s/5.<br />
Too bad that the most ergonomic in hand are the not the best looking Nexus S, Galaxy S and Galaxy S3.<br />
Having any buttons on top is a horrible idea. Just like headphone jack on the top or the charging port on the side.</p>
<p>One more phone which will turn on and off in your pocket.</p>
<p>&#8230;keep it on the top.</p>
<p>Funny thing is you don&#8217;t even need the power button to turn off or on for Blackberry 10,  to Turn on just swipe up when the screen is off and it will come to life, and When its on swipe down to put it to sleep. The power button is just there as a bonus. ;)</p>
<blockquote>I cannot believe we are having a debate on the location of the power button….If any physical button wakes the phone, who cares where the power button is</blockquote>
<p>Really? I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a fairly important factor.</p>
<p>Probably the most annoying thing about my 8X is the power button; it&#8217;s hard to press and reaching for the top of a 4.3&quot; phone isn&#8217;t as easy as it was with a 3.7&quot;. A power button on the side would make logical sense for a larger phone.</p>
<p>Power button placement is absolutely critical for phones with 4+ inch screen sizes. It needs to be on the side where your hand can reach the button without shifting the phone around. Because fuck that.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TVt2T.jpg" /></p>
<p>Alright then. Show off your Nexus 4.</p>
<p><strong>Reminders of my order STILL pending&#8230;</strong> :(</p>
<p>I was kind of going for, &#8220;look how easy it is to reach holding it normally&#8221;. <br />
I&#8217;m surprised to hear that your order is still pending, they&#8217;ve been in stock for the last couple of days now. That bumper on the other hand&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the UK where we get shafted for things like this. Play Store in the UK is saying 6-7 weeks for new orders. Mine is hopefully coming soon&#8230;<br />
But that bumper? At least it&#8217;s in the store &#8211; that wireless charging dock is what I&#8217;m after&#8230;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that. It was an awful wait for the week it took to get to me, I can&#8217;t imagine the agony of waiting 6-7 weeks. How dare they not make enough. I&#8217;d like that dock as well but the if I remember the video the Verge had with Matias. He said it was still in prototype stage, so that could be a long way off.</p>
<p>Sorry, but iPhone4 could also use the power/sleep button on the side. Though the physical home button does mitigate the issue.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s funny how RIM&#8217;s app selection is rarely a talking point.</p>
<p>while thats true if you watch some of RIM&#8217;s videos on youtube the new OS seems to have some great features. Samsung&#8217;s &#8216;new&#8217; feature of taking 5 photos and selecting the best face has already been shown to be on new blackberry cameras.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Scalado tech, which is now a part of Nokia.<br />
<a href="http://www.scalado.com" target="_blank">www.scalado.com</a></p>
<p>sorry i wasnt trying to say that they had invented it,  just that the devices themselves are obviously competitive, and consumers just have to wait on a more refined appstore</p>
<p>It may be Scalado tech but RIM exclusively licensed TimeShift before they were bought out by Nokia. So that innovation is only going to be on BB10.</p>
<p>I agree about the features&#8230; but you&#8217;re also detracting from the lack of apps. Why does it not seem to be an issue like it was/is on WP?</p>
<p>Im not really sure. It definitely should be something that people are discussing, especially since the appstore right now is pretty lacking (playing on my sister&#8217;s company given torch) , so maybe that issue will take over more at launch, like the lack of contacts and email did with the playbook</p>
<p>The reason why is because BB10 is boasting already 100,000 plus apps when they launch. Windows 7 launched with 30,000. Granted windows 8 had 110,000. The current 100,000 on bb doesn&#8217;t include 55,000 android and ios quality ports. By that I mean the best apps on android. Instagram is being built into the native BB10 camera app because of RIM and Facebook&#8217;s close relationship. Does windows phone 8 have instagram, which you may say isn&#8217;t an important app but ill let the stats take this one.</p>
<p>What about the Play store being available for BB10 through a VM like the Playbook? That sure to boost the numbers a lot!</p>
<p>What nonsense? It doesn&#8217;t matter what they&#8217;re launching with. It&#8217;s what they have now. WP has upwards of 120K and BlackBerry has close to that but they&#8217;ve been around much longer than WP.</p>
<p>Who said instagram&#8217;s being built into BB&#8217;s native camera? Do you not know that Microsoft and Facebook also share a close relationship? It&#8217;s either they both will get it at the same time or one slightly after the other or none will.</p>
<p>They also have a very different collection of apps compared to the popular platforms.</p>
<p>This is true.</p>
<p>thats fair,  i wasnt aware there were that many, although they will obviously need to play catch up with IOS and andriod</p>

<blockquote>The buttons are all located on the righthand side, with the volume buttons on top, the power beneath them&#8230;it&#8217;s more convenient than buttons placed on the top. Smartphone manufacturers take note: if your screen is bigger than 4 inches or so, put the power button on the side.</blockquote>
<p>Read. Remember. Obey. Read, remember&#8230;and obey!</p>
<p>Well, stick an iPhone next to this thing and they&#8217;re going to look pretty similar in shape judging by this image.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s probably why.</p>
<p>I still can&#8217;t hit iPhone power buttons well, especially when compared to my Focus which had the power exactly where my thumb rested.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re pushing it wrong.</p>
<p>Exactly. That&#8217;s what Steve Jobs would say.</p>
<p>Why the heck is the author of this article saying &#8220;this isn&#8217;t all that exciting?&#8221; If you don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s exciting, then why the heck are you publishing it? Wow, this author is so stuck up Apple&#8217;s derriere that he can&#8217;t even see a good thing when it&#8217;s staring him in the face. Same goes to whenever The Verge has their video/audio webcasts&#8230; all they are fans of are Apple products. Wake up Verge, we&#8217;re not all Apple fans so write your articles without your usual bias.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never had a phone with the power on the side, but I can see how it would be a good place to put it.</p>
<p>I had a POS Samsung slider a year or two ago and the power button was on the  right side  in the middle. It was extremely annoying/hard to press down. However, I can see how it would be convenient, dare I say ergonomic, to have the power button on the top right side of a phone. It kind of makes sense on an iPhone to be where it is but not on a giant 4.7&quot; phone.</p>
<p>The top power button on the iPhone would be fine regardless of screen size, because it&#8217;s not your primary way of waking up the device.  If the power button is your primary way of waking up the device, it should be easy to reach with your finger when holding the phone naturally.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people use the power button for shutting off the screen as well. Not familiar with iOS devices, so not sure if there as easy way to do that or a tech reason why it&#8217;s a non-issue.</p>
<p>Exactly, so why does it need to be in a place that&#8217;s accessible? The only thing that needs to be on the sides are the volume buttons so that when you&#8217;re in a call, you can easily adjust volume, press mute. When I want to shut off my screen, I can use both hands.</p>
<p>Give me a BlackBerry 10 already!</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind having the power button on the side. Even on the &#8220;tiny&#8221; iPhone4. But iPhone is just a big collection of ergonomic bloopers.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn-static.cnet.co.uk/i/c/blg/cat/mobiles/blackberry-london-vs-iphone.jpg" target="_blank">http://cdn-static.cnet.co.uk/i/c/blg/cat/mobiles/blackberry-london-vs-iphone.jpg</a></p>
<p>We already have comparison photos.</p>
<p>Power on top isn&#8217;t an issue cause you can wake the device just by doing a sliding gesture from the bottom of the screen. Sorry your Android/iOS/Windows Phone device can&#8217;t do that..</p>
<p>And slide from top to bottom bezel to shut off I guess?  Just like the playbook.  I don&#8217;t agree that is better than a side button directly under the thumb&#8230;. but better than the top mounted ones atleast</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not how you turn off the PlayBook. Just tap on the battery icon and select Standby. Or use the power button on the top.</p>
<p>What about double-tap to wake up on my N9? =D</p>
<p>I can wake my evo lte with a sliding gesture across the capacitive keys.</p>
<p>Left to right, screen on.  Right to left, screen off.</p>
<p>This can wake the phone with a swipe up. I don&#8217;t think there is a sleep gesture. Is that built in or with an app. That is a nifty trick either way!</p>
<p>BRO THERE IS A&quot; APP&quot; FOR THAT</p>
<p>The Bold 9900 has its lock button at the top, and it&#8217;s a convenient location.  I&#8217;ve the Dev Alpha B, and the lock/power button is well-placed.</p>
<p>The Bold is short which helps it a lot, that&#8217;s the exception rather than the rule these days.  The Dev B has it one the side?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it just 4.2&quot;?</p>
<p>If by IT you are referencing my HTC 8X, no, it is a rather tall 4.3&quot; device</p>
<p>He is referencing the first BB10 device: the L series code named London. The 8X is a large device for its screen size. This will be closer to the iPhone 5 then the 8X, I think.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn-static.cnet.co.uk/i/c/blg/cat/mobiles/blackberry-london-vs-iphone.jpg" /></p>
<p>If the London is anything like the Alpha B (which is suspected to), this will have a 4.2 inch screen. That isn&#8217;t too big.</p>
<p>Oh, and with BB10 you don&#8217;t need it to wake up the phone, just to put it to sleep. A swipe up from the bottom of the screen shows a fading an animation for the lock screen.</p>
<p>On the right, right?</p>
<p>Yes, thanks to no edit button I couldn&#8217;t change it.</p>
<p>Teaser shots don&#8217;t sell units, a compelling offering sells units.  RIM needs to stop with all the foreplay and just show us what they have.</p>
<p>Come back on January 30th</p>
<p>Well atleast it&#8217;s got your attention and got you thinking about what they have to unveil.</p>
<p>RIM didn&#8217;t get my attention, The Verge drew my attention to this ad and it can&#8217;t possibly be the marketing strategy for this magical and revolutionary new platform to have the tech blogs get the word out by covering teaser shots.</p>
<p>&#8230;If they hadn&#8217;t created a teaser shot, you wouldn&#8217;t be talking about it right now.</p>
<p>So why post?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not ready to release, so why would they show us what they have now? They&#8217;re planning on showing us the devices Jan 30th, and I doubt they&#8217;d be selling on the same day. Even if they were and they decided to &#8220;show us what they have&#8221; today,  anticipation and excitement will have cooled by Jan 30th. That&#8217;s almost 2 months away.</p>
<p>But yeah, I definitely think RIM should take the advice of some guy on the internet rather than follow their plan devised by a entire team of specialists.</p>
<p>This is the biggest buying season of the year for this class of device, THAT is why they should show us now rather than wait a month after that.  I&#8217;m not saying they have to ship the products now but I would imagine they have the first round of BB10 devices planned well enough to be able to tell us features and show us some production hardware.</p>
<p>I disagree. There&#8217;s enough releases right now that I think they should wait until it&#8217;s quieter and get more press.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re absolutely not into marketing at all so please shut the hell up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not into marketing?  What does that even mean?</p>
<p>Oh so you want RIM to be like Nokia&#8230;.show off a phone and don&#8217;t release it for 4 months?</p>
<p>Brilliant strategy. /s</p>
<p>Looks like a fresh design approach from RIM. I do like the textured back. The power button on the top right would take a few days to adjust to being a righty who primarily holds their phone with their left hand.</p>
<p>Same, loving the textured back. Reminds me of the Nexus 7 a little.</p>
<p>At this point RIM &#8216;teasing&#8217; a new product is like Grandma trying to tease you with her thigh.</p>
<p>hahah totally. The only way RIM could drum up interest at this point would be to announce that they&#8217;re ditching BB10 and going all in with Android/Windows Phone.</p>
<p>This OS will be a complete failure. The usefulness of hardware keyboards is waning, apps are more important than BBM, &#8220;security&#8221; is not exclusive to RIM products. Consumers won&#8217;t buy it. Enterprises who haven&#8217;t already adopted BYOD might, but it&#8217;s a shrinking pool.</p>
<p>Actually there&#8217;s a lot of interest. You&#8217;re just not visiting the areas of the internet where the interest is.</p>
<p>&#8220;This OS will be a complete failure&#8221;<br />
You can see the future?</p>
<p>&#8220;The usefulness of hardware keyboards is waning&#8221;<br />
Which is why there is so much focus on the L-Series. Initially the N-Series was actually to be released a couple of months after the L-Series, similarly to what they have done with the Dev Alpha A, B and now C. A and B are touch only, and getting those into developers&#8217; hands lets them develop for touch-centric. The C isn&#8217;t even out yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;apps are more important than BBM&#8221;<br />
What exactly is your point? There are apps for BB7 too. The majority of them suck, and there aren&#8217;t a lot, and this is why RIM is so focused on developers for BB10.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumers won’t buy it&#8221;<br />
Correction &#8211; YOU won&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>Good job schooling that moron! +1</p>
<p>Mattkicksass</p>
<p>Oh people do you hear him? Apple Fanboy #1 on The Verge forums, doesn&#8217;t have any idea of anything.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just plain stupid, Matt. Don&#8217;t judge over thing you don&#8217;t any facts about.</p>
<p>My Grandpa is really excited about BB10 and your Grandma.</p>
<p>I heard chatroulette will be standard feature on BB10</p>
<p>&gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Grandma by choice.</p>
<p>Incredible how many Verge users are mis- and disinformed about BlackBerry 10. I tell you what this is like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like in 2007 when all made fun of the iPhone being a toy. We know how that went &#8211; time for revenge. The RIMPIRE strikes back.</p>
<p>A rectangular shaped slab of plastic with glass in front .Wow RIM ,welcome to 2012 .Missed the boat by 5 years huh</p>
<p>I hear the iPhone and touchscreen phones are still a fad that will die any day now.  Any day now&#8230;</p>
<p>We keep hearing the same shit since 200o about apple&#8217;s demise with the ipod.</p>
<p>I was making fun of Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis&#8217;s constant dismissive comments about the iPhone.  As the only Canadian phone manufacturer, I&#8217;d like RIM to succeed, but they&#8217;ve spent most of the last five years attempting to run away from industry trends because of sheer arrogance.  I don&#8217;t think they can be saved at this point.</p>
<p> &#8220;<em>[Apple and the iPhone is] kind of one more entrant into an already very busy space with lots of choice for consumers … But in terms of a sort of a sea-change for BlackBerry, I would think that&#8217;s overstating it.</em>&#8221;– Jim Balsillie, February 2007<br />
&#8220;<em>The most exciting mobile trend is full Qwerty keyboards. I&#8217;m sorry, it really is. I&#8217;m not making this up.</em>&#8221;-Mike Lazaridis, May 2008.<br />
&#8220;<em>There may be 300,000 apps for the iPhone and iPad, but the only app you really need is the browser.</em>&#8221;-Jim Balsillie, November 2010.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/They-said-what-Great-quotes-from-Jim-Balsillie-and-Mike-Lazaridis_id31751">PhoneArena.com</a></p>
<p>Where is arrogance here?</p>
<p>First quote: the iPhone wasn&#8217;t on the market in Feb 07. NOBODY expected the iPhone to change anything, not only Balsillie.</p>
<p>Second quote: The iPhone 2G was the current iPhone in May 08. It couldn&#8217;t send MMS, it couldn&#8217;t multitask, it couldn&#8217;t copy and paste. The AppStore was by far not in its todays constitution. The iPhone was just a shiny luxury-phone lacking basic features here. At the same time, RIM and BlackBerry were EXPANDING like hell, they grew faster than the iPhone here, fully benefiting of the early smartphone boom. From a business perspective, SURE Lazaridis thought people want QWERTY keyboards.</p>
<p>Third quote: Actually he is right here, he talks of NEEDING things. And what do most of the iPhone and iPad apps do? They&#8217;re another way to display websites. There&#8217;s a CNN app, you can go to cnn.com. I bet at least 60% of all todays iOS apps are website&#8217;s siblings. The only problem is, people rather want apps instead of using the browser, but they clearly don&#8217;t need them for the task itself.</p>
<p>Not to forget: what shall they do? The classic BB-OS isn&#8217;t capable of being competitive to Android or iOS and it took time to realize that. They needed a new system with future and which fits their established infrastructure and customer base. Android was not an option.</p>
<p>People act like if RIM could&#8217;ve picked any new fresh and modern OS to build a competitive phone at any given time during the last five years. They bought QNX in April 10 and built a new OS from ground up during the last 2.5 years. And it&#8217;ll be more fortunate than any other system out there. Good bye toy phones.</p>
<blockquote>the iPhone wasn’t on the market in Feb &#8217;07. </blockquote>
<p>The iPhone was announced in January of 07 during Macworld.  Tech geeks routinely mocked it for its perceived weaknesses prior to launch, but it proceeded to sell ridiculously well.  Even as the company was developing and eventually released it&#8217;s own touchscreen smartphone (the Blackberry Storm), it continued to insist that touchscreen keyboards were a failed idea.<br />
<blockquote>The iPhone 2G was the current iPhone in May 08. </blockquote><br />
No such device ever existed.  The current phone in May was still the original iPhone.  The iPhone 3G was released a couple months later in July &#8216;08.  None of the features you mentioned became available until the 3GS was released in summer &#8217;09.  Multitasking had been available on the platform since the beginning, but wasn&#8217;t made available to third party apps until iOS 4.0, and even then, only in extremely limited ways.<br />
<blockquote>Actually he is right here, he talks of NEEDING things. And what do most of the iPhone and iPad apps do? They’re another way to display websites. [&#8230;] I bet at least 60% of all todays iOS apps are website’s siblings. </blockquote><br />
We don&#8217;t NEED email with us everywhere we go, and we certainly don&#8217;t NEED art and music and entertainment.  But we will want what we want, and many of us want all of those.  Given that well over 60% of all iOS apps would be games, they wouldn&#8217;t be website siblings.  Even among those that are, the reason for using an app instead of a simple mobile website is that the app conforms to the phone&#8217;s screen much easier than creating a mobile website that has to conform to every possible mobile web browser, whether it be the terrible feature phone browsers, or the incredibly powerful browsers in iOS, Android and WinPhone.  The irony in this statement from Balsillie is that the BB browser on most of their current devices at the time was rather lousy.</p>
<p>Actually they&#8217;ve been doing devices like that for a while now. They do suck, but your point is moot.</p>
<p>Yeah yeah, RIM: we already know everything of your new devices.<br />
No surprises.<br />
You&#8217;re gonna fail&#8230;</p>
<p>We actually know almost nothing about the new devices.</p>
<p>lol, wow, that nicomors guy is a complete fool.</p>
<p>&#8220;we already know everything of your new devices&#8221;<br />
No, you don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;No surprises&#8221;<br />
You think they wouldn&#8217;t save one or two cool features to show off on Jan 30th?</p>
<p>&#8220;You’re gonna fail…&#8221;<br />
And you know this how?</p>
<p>The BlackBerry logo is not just a bunch of spots but consists of lots of B&#8217;s in the negative space!</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be so biased guys!<br />
Everything I see on this photo looks pretty nice. The texture of the back looks good, the spacing between the camera and the edges looks alright.<br />
I assume the hardware will be pretty solid. Not sure about the software though&#8230;<br />
Anyhow, I definitely give them a chance.</p>
<p>Wait&#8230;..people still use BlackBerrys?</p>

<p>About 80million regularly by the end of Q3 2012</p>
<p>/shrug,</p>
<p>BB10 is a start over from scratch. Just like Windows Mobile 6 to Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested to see what they do because it&#8217;s going to have to be something pretty f-ing special to make anyone buy one &#8211; I mean it needs to be like 20-30% better than an iPhone/Nexus 4 to get people to consider switching.  So, it&#8217;s either going to be mind-blowingly awesome or RIM&#8217;s final death throes.  Either way worth watching.</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10 will make iOS and Android look like they&#8217;re from the dinosaur age.</p>
<p>This should be a hoot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m liking the textured back. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s rubber like the Playbook/Nexus 7.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something I wish more phones did.</p>
<p>Oh no, it&#8217;s got rounded corners&#8230; I bet some other company is sharpening up the lawyers&#8230;</p>
<p>Good luck to them but I think it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>Why is it too late? Is there a new law that prohibits them from selling new phones?</p>
<p>Is RIM really in a position to be &#8216;teasing&#8217; anything? Forget the teasers&#8230; this phone should have came out years ago. Give us a reason to buy this first generation brick.</p>
<p>Sweetie, you&#8217;re a brick.</p>
<p>I just saw the tech demo of the BB10. I wanna ask you guys&#8230;</p>
<p>What do you think about the BlackBerry Balance feature? It allows you to toggle between Personal and Work modes which I think is pretty killer. Mind you, I own an iPhone, lol and seeing that particular feature made me want to switch over. I&#8217;m just curious about people&#8217;s thoughts on it.</p>
<p>BlackBerry Balance already exists on current devices.  It&#8217;s an interesting idea.</p>
<p>One of the things that made people think BlackBerry devices were inferior is because often they would get them from work totally locked down and this should help with that.  Might be too late though since many work places are no longer giving out BlackBerry phones as work phones.</p>
<p>Not &#8220;many.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with you. None of the other platforms supports this yet. This and among other features also the ability to run Android apps will make BB interesting again for many enterprises.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m looking forward to the BB10 QWERTY,  it&#8217;s nice to see BB10 move closer and closer to market.  I am &#8220;BlackBerry by choice&#8221; and can&#8217;t wait for January 30 to roll around.</p>
<p>Looks like Steve McQueen&#8217;s racing gloves.</p>
<p>nice analogy, lets hope its as classy as Steve McQueen !</p>
<p>This is BlackBerry&#8217;s answer to the HTC Surround. The entire back of the phone is a speaker.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re probably getting this in March-April, maybe at BlackBerry Live.</p>
<p>my playbook wants this soo bad</p>
<p>My playbook is ready.</p>
<p>I hope they are able to. Good on Blackberry if they can !</p>
<p>How much effort is to port BB10 onto PB? A lot. That too for no reason?</p>
<p>People bought their hardware, those same people deserve support, BlackBerry needs loyal customers more than ever and throwing customers a bone is one way to help.</p>
<p>Might have to dust off the old playbook when this happens.</p>
<p>My body is ready.</p>
<p>Blackberry should design a version for Kindle Fire v.1 tablets to get people interested in BB10. There`s ton of these tablets floating around for next to nothing. Good resouce w/o having to buy new hardware you may not want.</p>
<p>I have a Playbook.<br />
hehheh<br />
I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>What was the app that tells you when it&rsquo;s going to rain Nilay was talking about?</p>
<p>I wonder how they will deal with IS updated in general.  Even more so will there be any&#8230;</p>

<p>you mean Blackberry?</p>
<p>Technically, at that point in time it was still RIM ;)</p>

<p>Dieter I like your hair. How do you get it cut?</p>
<p>With scissors.</p>
<p>Well you do a great job cutting it Tom.</p>
<p>Technically, at that point in time it was still Research in Motion.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a habit for a while.  Just like writing 2012 instead of 2013. :-)</p>
<p>&ldquo;RIM is hopelessly lapped in this race, so BB10 basically needs to be a miracle. I&rsquo;m getting the sense that it&rsquo;s nice, but far from miraculous. They&rsquo;ll have my attention if I start hearing otherwise&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the exact reaction i&rsquo;m seeing from the entire industry. It&rsquo;s nice, but not anything to write home about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the entire industry&rdquo;? that would be a good point, if you were not just making things up as you type the comment. That developer, whomever he is, I have an iPhone never heard of Clear or if I have I&rsquo;ve forgotten what it is, needs to pull his oversized head out of his ass.</p>
<p>I think clear is the company a old apple employee started, and apple just recently bought. Of course he&#8217;d out it down</p>
<p>This is one thing I don&rsquo;t get about Microsoft and Nokia&hellip; Nokia especially has been throwing around a lot of money to get apps for their Lumia&rsquo;s but they are making no effort in getting Instagram.. If BB gets its before them , they should bow their heads in shame</p>
<p>this is so true. my wife is actually pretty bummed she can&rsquo;t get it on her WP8 phone. there were screenshot&rsquo;s of an icon a long time ago. what the hell is happening?</p>
<p>dont know if they haven&rsquo;t tried. i bet you they begged but facebook has stated that it only is developing for ios and android. rimm&rsquo;s effort to woo developers should make wp team ashamed of their half assed attempts at bringing in developers. coming from a long time wp user and kermudgen, i feel that msft has given up. im just saying my opinion,  and to the fanboys that will reply with some bs, this is my opinion and wp fanatics can eat a big one</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call MS attempts half ass.   If half these apps are just Android apps ported into the runtime thats  not the solution.</p>
<p>their own software is still not available on their own platform (photosynth), the others are all betas (skype and nokia maps). half the apps made by microsoft haven&rsquo;t been updated in a year&hellip;looking at world clock. msftcould put a 100 mil aside to bring in app developers but instead they pay jessica alba and oprah. oh and no vability to watch your msft videos. no vudu no hulu and flixster is barebones. even thought they are on xbox and win8.  seems half ass to me</p>
<p>Post again when you know what you aren&rsquo;t talking about&hellip;seriously&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;ll say it again. Instagram wants WP to fail. Their CEO came from Google and they have a general anti-Microsoft attitude. It will only happen after the merger settles and Facebook assumes complete control.</p>
<p>really???? cause facebook doesn&rsquo;t make windows apps,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so, there was some sort of <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1809035/could-instagram-come-windows-phone-android">hint a last year</a> that it was coming to windows phone, then it all changed when Facebook bought them . Looking at the good relationship Microsoft has with Facebook it shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to convince them to make a windows phone app .. come on .. they even got them to use Bing ! What else is harder than that? Maybe they are not trying harder?</p>
<p>Sweet Jesus, kind enough to share what you&rsquo;re smoking with us?</p>
<p>Actually, with 720 &times; 720 display on Q10, it actually makes it a great device for tacking instagram pictures</p>
<p>It looks like a. 3 way ecosystem is too much to ask for.</p>
<p>No it&rsquo;s not, app developers just aren&rsquo;t sure what the third ecosystem will be. They&rsquo;re probably thinking better to let BlackBerry and MS fight it out and then support the winner. It does seem though that BlackBerry&rsquo;s developer courtship is definitely tipping the scales in their favour.</p>
<p>Whatsapp, skype.. Windows Phone always had these apps. I don&rsquo;t understand how bb10 is better here??</p>
<p>Blackberry does have dropbox, that&rsquo;s something WP8 can&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>and songza, which i want on my 920</p>
<p>Well, if your saying a native app, sure.  If you&rsquo;re just making a general statement, that would be incorrect.</p>
<p>they had none of those when they launched windows phone 7. even skype took a long time to be available.</p>
<p>Well, Skype is a completely different animal than that of Whatsapp.  WP7.x doesn&rsquo;t have the internal architecture to support Skype running in a background fashion, where WP8 does.</p>
<p>BB10 has the internal architecture. That makes a difference.</p>
<p>Sure, and so does WP8, which is the current version.  And what does that have to do with the point mentioned above?  Biotronik1 stated that WP7 didn&rsquo;t have Whatsapp or Skype at launch, and are now available.  Does it really matter if it was available at launch or not?  We are talking about two different products that launched at two completely different points in time.  Now, if BB10 and WP8 launched TODAY and WP8 didn&rsquo;t have Whatsapp or Skype, sure, I would completely agree.</p>
<p>well WP7 launced quite some time ago (not comparable) and currently WP8 has all those apps. Verge still does not speak favorably of WP8 appstore yet they find BB10 app tore promising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ultimately indie developers need to allocate their resources wisely and therefore we will wait for actual sales numbers to make a decision whether or not we&rsquo;ll develop for BB10.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AFAIK, QNX can technically run any android app.  this is RIMs ace up their sleeve</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t actually QNX that can run any Android app. It is the emulator that Blackberry has built into the OS that allows it to happen. There is some slight modification depending on what your app does but it really should stand in the way of any good developer.</p>
<p>Actually, why would a dev want to write or port an app to Android 2.3, which is what the emulator runs?</p>
<p>Because a huge portion of Android users still run 2.3, so they have to develop for it anyway?</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see this as a viable long term strategy for companies doing ports or for BlackBerry. On my playbook android apps seem quite sluggish. The Verge&rsquo;s review found the same thing with the Z10. If I am going to port my app, and I care about my users, developing a native version using either Cascades or Web Works is really my best option.</p>
<p>I agree with you mostly. I don&rsquo;t know if the runtime on the new device behaves differently from the PB. What I&rsquo;ve used the most is Ghost Commander and it works reasonably well for me &ndash; and PB 1st gen is 1 core 1ghz. On the other hand Flipboard is a mess, with rotation issues and being unresponsive. IMDB is in between. Google Sky view works but is jittery. Even Latitude worked, but for the street view, but it felt somewhat unstable. I sideloaded most of those (Ghost commander is in the BB world though &ndash; and no so strangely is the one that works well) to try them out but they could have been rushed in terms of adapting them by god know who. Because even at the simple repack runtime level, proper and official development matters&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the runtime can be good for small static stuff, some utilities etc. Of course I couldn&rsquo;t understand if someone wanted to focus on the runtime, especially when you look at QML etc.</p>
<p>Agree, but I believe the guys at BlackBerry are aware of this. My bet it&#8217;s just a quick temporary solution to boost the number of apps in their store, for marketing purpose while they&#8217;re launching BB10. It&#8217;s really a critical moment for them. And if they keep relying on ported apps in their next product iterations, they&#8217;re digging their own grave then, all the buzzes today will go into a waste.</p>
<p>AFAIK That experience is HORRIBLE as reported by Josh Tops in his Z10 review.</p>
<p>I have many Android apps on my Playbook and they run pretty much perfect.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>advance task manager<br />
vevo<br />
ted<br />
mvideoplayer<br />
x-plore<br />
dropbox<br />
skydrive<br />
onn<br />
bbc<br />
slate<br />
skyfire<br />
maxthon<br />
imdb<br />
soundcloud<br />
google translate<br />
tweetdeck<br />
winamp<br />
photoshop express<br />
instapaper<br />
repligo reader<br />
ebay<br />
atorrent<br />
utorrent remote<br />
dolphin browser</p>
<p>there are thousands of apps that work without issue.</p>
<p>I of course can&rsquo;t wait until all the apps designed with Cascades start hitting to take full advantage of the performance capabilities of BB10 (which will be coming to the PB soon)</p>
<p>Thank you +1 &#8230; This guy on the verge choose the worse android port apps to review.</p>
<p>Excellent write up Dieter!</p>
<p>WP8:  lacks apps &ndash; over 150,000</p>
<p>Blackberry: surprised by how many apps they have  &ndash; 70,000.</p>
<p>FWIW, for a lot of people the world does not revolve around Instagram.</p>
<p>This. And quite a lot of WP&rsquo;s 150K were original WP apps and not slap-dash ports.</p>
<p>exactly. I really don&rsquo;t understand why app situation looks fine on BB10 and bad on WP8. really absurd</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the numeric difference.  WP8 had WP7 and WP7.5 before it, so one would reasonably expect a much more well-developed app ecosystem.  How many apps in total did WP7 have on launch day?  How many of the top 100 apps were on WP7 on launch day?  Compare that to BB10 on its launch day.  In fact, compare it to iOS and Android at the same points in their lifecycle, and BB10 actually looks quite good.</p>
<p>WP8 is to WP7, what BB10 is to BB7. It&rsquo;s only fair to compare WP8 on launch to BB10 on launch, as both are ground up rewrites.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not true, windows phone 8 is exactly what windows phone 7/7.5 was suppose to be Microsoft just messed it up. They basically look exactly the same. Bb10 is to bbos7 what wp8/7 is to windows mobile 1-6.0</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re just going to ignore that WP7 runs on the WindowsCE kernel and WP8 runs on the WindowsNT kernel and shares network stacks, etc., with full Windows 8? Just because they &ldquo;look the same&rdquo; does not mean they are the same. Although WP8 is what Microsoft would have wanted, they first had to port the whole WindowsNT kernel over to <span class="caps">ARM</span> (and it be stable).</p>
<p>Growing the app market or not, I don&rsquo;t like the idea of throwing money around to woo developers.</p>
<ul>
<li>It sets a bad precedence for one thing which could be negative for the market in longer term.</li>
	<li>It insults developers who developed apps of their own interest.</li>
	<li>It hurts small and indie developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any technical help? OK. Developer support? OK. Throwing around money? Not OK.</p>
<p>Applies to MS or RIM or Nokia or whoever it is.</p>
<p>Brand leverage &ldquo;is&rdquo; money. Developers benefit from brand attraction and the best example of this is Apple obviously. Discovery of apps in store, marketing, all of this &ldquo;is&rdquo; money. The 10k commitment is not forever, it&rsquo;s for 12 months after the february deadline if I understand correctly, to kickstart more development on the platform &ndash; especially after the brand had been maliciously defamed for years now. I don&rsquo;t think many devs will be &ldquo;insulted&rdquo; honestly for doing business as usual and being rewarded if they have a quality app that&rsquo;s popular. I note that the independent dev I was talking about below in relation to Caustic2 just upgraded his app to BB10&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think he hurts. I wish you would explain why you think financial incentives hurt small devs?</p>
<p>No mention of  android apps being submitted to the blackberry store without the developers consent?</p>
<p>Maybe because the news was overblown, and RIM rectified the situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, none of these will be getting financial incentives because for an app to qualify for the 10k commitment, it must be <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/documentation/terms.html">Built for BB certified</a> &ndash; an Android repack is insufficient. Maybe a few crooks thought they could make 10k&hellip; it&rsquo;s not happening. Maybe a few people thought they could shed some bad light on the initiative &ndash; not happening either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take an example like this fabulous music production app &ndash; <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/106066/?countrycode=US">Caustic2</a>. This app exists on many platforms, and seems to be the making of a one man dev from NZ. The app is fully native &ndash; the racks pull down vertically &ndash; it&rsquo;s visually stunning, it&rsquo;s quick. Furthermore, on my PB at least, the app doesn&rsquo;t rely on the OS UI for navigation or settings, yet it works great.</p>
<p>My first point is that many independent developers don&rsquo;t think like some of those highly ecosystem entrenched devs. Some of those devs should maybe ask themselves &ndash; do they still develop for consumers (and of course, for fun, interest and to make a living) or have they become business stakeholders in some of those ecosystems? I&rsquo;ll concede that some apps with complex backends require a more cautious treatment than a standalone app. In any case, it may also be worthwile for some devs to have the porting job done by specialized resources that are not in house. An example is Unity through Union (see BB 10 library <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/library_support_at_a_glance.html">support</a>). ROI has to be analyzed but porting doesn&rsquo;t necessarily involve starting from scratch either and there are many resources <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting.html">available</a>.</p>
<p>My second point is about the lack of uniformity of apps compared to UI &ndash; alluded to in Mr Topolsky&rsquo;s review. Well, that&rsquo;s why I talked about Caustic 2 because it relies on nothing from the UI yet works just excellently. I believe <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/design/bb10/">best practices</a> will emerge and will be followed, but I do like this possibility for devs to be entirely &ldquo;free&rdquo; from UI &ldquo;restraints&rdquo;. For me that&rsquo;s quite a positive.</p>
<p>Thanks for the pointer to Caustic2! It&rsquo;s amazing what a one-man team can accomplish across every major platform. The app (and LoopStack) look truly awesome.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re very welcome &ndash; I also suggest you take a look at <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/20061846/?countrycode=US">Nodebeat</a> &ndash; still music creation but with some random component to it &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;tool&rdquo; like Caustic but I&rsquo;ve had lots of fun with it! Once again, a completely in app UI, completely different yet fully usable! And again, just 3 guys&hellip; multiplatform!</p>
<p>Serious question. Why didn&rsquo;t RIM/BlackBerry use Android instead? What does an in-house-developed operating system give them?</p>
<p>IP, jobs, control of their backend services, differentiation, etc. With BB7 they were already at the level of HTC or Sony in terms of mobile market share &ndash; no need to stall there and try to compete with Samsung.</p>
<p>Because their in-house-developed OS looks less sluggish and nicer than Android?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other apps made it though the processes&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you mean <em>through</em>.</p>
<p>As far as I know Instagram cannot be run on the BB10 because the Android version of the app relies on native (C/C++) libraries and currently that is not supported on BB10.</p>
<p>What a bullshit. <strong>Of course C++ is supported</strong>.</p>
<p>C++ <strong>is</strong> supported on BB10, but the convertor doesn&rsquo;t support Android apps that have C++ libraries in them. Read more here <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/apisupport/unsupportedapi_blackberry10_software_features.html" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android/apisupport/unsupportedapi_blackberry10_software_features.html</a></p>
<p>A HelloWorld can be packaged, but we&rsquo;re talking here about Instagram and I think it&rsquo;s not possible to port it so easily</p>
<p>Moving from my iPhone 5 Instagram is one of my most used app. I was wondering why RIM didn&#8217;t talk about it. For a second I thought it might not be available for bb10.  Good to hear its on the work. Can&#8217;t wait BlackBerry Z10!</p>
<p>Instagram seems to be a killer app nowadays (which is kind of silly), but if BB can get a &ldquo;true&rdquo; instagram app it will hurt MS quite a lot. If it is just another of those shitty android rip offs, it doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>However, BB already have some great apps ie the great wine scanner, Vivino (though Vivino didn&rsquo;t knew they had a BB app, lol!). Vivino on WP is really bad and they can&rsquo;t afford to make/maintain an app for WP, so the android ports may be crap, but they are still there and fanboys will ignore the issues (to a certain point), the problem is that normal customers will get annoyed a buy a new unit when they get a chance.<br />
The hole android-port thing is not just a problem because they run in an environment that they shouldn&rsquo;t, but also because android isn&rsquo;t properly stable and fluent even with 4.1 &ndash; and BB used 2.3, man thats a bad decision!</p>
<p>As for now, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend anyone buying BB unless you already have a smartphone you like. For now BB will only be a toy, maybe it&rsquo;ll change in the coming months, who knows?</p>
<p>I am so happy to see such a great article posted on &ldquo;The Verge&rdquo; regarding BlackBerry 10. I am M.Rizk, founder of BerryEG, the Egyptian BlackBerry news portal. After reading so many comments in here, I wanted to reply to them all in one.</p>
<p>I noticed that so many people like Instagram and wish it comes to the BlackBerry 10, some others are sad it&rsquo;s not there and they claim that BlackBerry 10 can never be successful with out it. Regarding Instagram, it&rsquo;s a great app I believe. But BlackBerry 10 already includes a Photo Filter which got mostly the same exact photo editing features provided by Instagram and you can instantly upload those pictures edited by BlackBerry to Twitter or Facebook! Instagram could be offering so extra &ldquo;minor&rdquo; features, although we can live without these extra features as said here on &ldquo;The Verge&rdquo; Instagram will make it&rsquo;s way soon to BlackBerry 10 anyway.</p>
<p>Regarding Android and porting apps on BlackBerry 10. Many people are not sure why Android apps are not smooth as expected on BlackBerry 10 and they don&rsquo;t run as native. Well I&rsquo;ve got to say that making BlackBerry 10 run Android wasn&rsquo;t easy at all. Research in Motion (Now BlackBerry) didn&rsquo;t just port Android 2.3 to BlackBerry 10 and here you go it works. Well they could have done this, but this will ruin the BlackBerry 10 Security. We all know that Android is full of security holes and it can be easily hacked, It also got so many viruses. That&rsquo;s why Research in Motion nearly had to build Android of scratch to make it more secure on the BlackBerry 10 platform that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not as smooth as the native one. Research in Motion still decided to work on Android to attract developers to the BlackBerry 10 platform, also easily port the important and simple Android apps.</p>
<p> Regarding the App Submission and piracy. I agree that in the past few weeks some fake developers were able to port some Android apps, including paid ones and submit them to AppWorld (BlackBerry World now). This was sad, but Research in Motion asked all Android devs if they ever find their app they can contact Research in Motion AppWorld team and they will remove the app almost immediately.</p>
<p>In some of the comments above, People asked, Why Research in Motion didn&rsquo;t use Android instead. Simply they can&rsquo;t. BlackBerry is not only a chatting smartphone for adults. BlackBerry is for enterprise solutions too. Real Enterprises will never want to get their data stolen or exposed to others. That&rsquo;s what Android does. Android is the most insecure Mobile Platform.</p>
<p>From here, on &ldquo;The Verge&rdquo; I am telling all developers worldwide. Join us on BlackBerry 10, develop for it. It&rsquo;s your chance to get well-known as your app might have got no other alternative. BlackBerry 10 is still growing a day after another. As more people buy BlackBerry 10 with no much apps on BlackBerry World the more people who will notice your app and use it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s above was all technical explanation. But now I&rsquo;ve got to say my own opinion. For those in love with Windows Mobile OS, Personally I have never tried it, but what I know well that in the past few years Nokia never chose a good OS to use on their devices, including Symbian, Meego and might be WP too. I don&rsquo;t think developers like Nokia either for what they have done in the past years, they have had millions of devices look at their empty store &ldquo;Ovi&rdquo;, each device got about 2 to 3 apps and other useless icons.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s so despicable from Instagram developers!!! what an act of a**holeness. I mean the OS is still few days old and the phone just got out in the market and you&rsquo;re working and developing an app?<br />
And in WP you said and announced that you&rsquo;re not currently interested in developing an app for the platform??? Best camera on any smartphone and you won&rsquo;t consider developing an app? or at least give permission for 3rd party apps to upload pics!!! <br />
PS: My words might not be accurate, but if they&rsquo;re not please do enlighten me.</p>
<p>Have you seen this one? &mdash; <a href="http://crackberry.com/where-theres-will-theres-way" target="_blank">http://crackberry.com/where-theres-will-theres-way</a></p>
<p>I <span class="caps">GUESS</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span> IS <span class="caps">REALLY</span> <span class="caps">COMING</span> <span class="caps">SOON</span> :)<br />
Go Team BlackBerry!</p>
<p>Crackberry&rsquo;s rejoice!</p>
<p>Generally, the apps for every platform other than iPhone and Android have been garbage.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve used the non-updated graphics, and less informative GameDay views for every other platform&hellip; plus other platforms don&rsquo;t get the live video features that you get with an MLB.tv subscription.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious to know which version Blackberry will be getting.  If it&rsquo;s the less-featured version that webOS and Windows Phone have gotten in the past, it&rsquo;s not even worth using.  However, if it&rsquo;s the full-featured version that Android and iOS get, that might possibly be newsworthy.</p>
<p>It will be a native build I believe, no confirmation though.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean anything.  The aforementioned webOS and Windows Phone apps were both built natively for those platforms too, and they were missing most features.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. Here&rsquo;s hoping it is a full version.</p>
<p>Were those technically labeled &lsquo;At Bat&rsquo; or just GameDay Audio?  I had both and remember being angry about the limitations of them.</p>
<p>They were labeled At Bat.</p>
<p>They promised the app for WP7 and BB last year too, then after they failed to deliver, they pulled the info from site and retro-actively claimed they never said they were putting out an app.</p>
<p>They did put out a WP app, but it was crap, and they were still charging MLB.TV subscribers for it after promising it would be included free, as it is for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Actually, At Bat 12 did come out for BB.  You had to pay for it, but it did come out.</p>
<p>Since MLB is touting it, I would imagine they aren&rsquo;t intending to put out an inferior version.  The question will be how well it works and whether or not they can sell enough subs to make the dev effort worth it.</p>
<p>but yet you picture a Mac Book Air for some reason.   Yes we get it  The Verge Staff all uses Macs.</p>
<p>why not show a blackberry for crying out loud.</p>
<p>We used that picture because baseball.</p>
<p>But thanks.</p>
<p>You see, this article is in the BlackBerry Section not the Baseball/MacBook section.</p>
<p>Obviously you wanted to promote SB Nation here. That&rsquo;s why The Verge looks more like a blog and not a News publication.</p>
<p>Your mistaking the hipster writers on the Verge with the professional writers on the NY Times, or the Springfield Gazette for that matter. When you&rsquo;re a hipster writer, you&rsquo;re paid pennies per word and really don&rsquo;t care because it&rsquo;s just a job, not a career.</p>
<p>and also to show your hippster badge by showing off a Mac.  You forgot that. that is priority and hippster 101.</p>
<p>This is pretty common on the verge. If there is story about, say, facebook then there is huge chance that the accompanied picture is the facebook app in ios or a osx screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/facebook" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/tag/facebook</a></p>
<p>I understand that this is because you guys use whatever you have at hand and most Verge staffers use Apple products, and I am okay with that. But it would be nice if you guys could try to include other platforms too or use more neutral images to not confuse the users.</p>
<p>just my $0.02</p>
<p>and mac book airs mean baseball?</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense, gloves are used to catch baseballs, not computers.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t usually (ever) get into the drama about The Verge&#8217;s love for Apple and sometimes inappropriate references to the company and its products but this one is particularly bad. Why? Because this time around the use of a MacBook is not only totally random and unrelated to the article in any way whatsoever, but because it is confusing to readers. When I saw the image used for this article, I expected the article to relate to Apple, even if in a small way, and assumed that the headline just didn&#8217;t capture that fact. As it turns out, it was just a pointless Apple reference for the sake of absolutely nothing. Nothing about that image says anything whatsoever about Blackberry. You&#8217;re better than this embarrassment Verge. I know that. I hope you do as well.</p>
<p>This is great news. I&#8217;m a Toronto Blue Jays fan looking forward to this season. It&#8217;s good to see major apps coming to BlackBerry 10. Here in Canada Maple Leafs Sports &amp; Entrainment, Tim Hortons (hopefully they&#8217;ll have NFC based payment which is available with current BlackBerry), Air Canada and others confirmed BB10 apps at launch. I&#8217;m going to be switching to BlackBerry Z10 from my iPhone 5. Only a week left till launch!</p>
<p>I read on CB that there will also be a NHL Gamecenter app and CBC Hockey Night in Canada app.</p>
<p>BlackBerry is a huge sponsor of the Toronto Blue Jays. The Jays are going for it this year. Perfect timing. Either way BlackBerry 10 browser will have flash built in I can stream the games on the go for free on thefirstrow website.</p>
<p>Good for Rim. I&rsquo;m more excited about BB10 for my wife that was always a BB fan but their phones started getting bypassed by other OS&rsquo; and she switched to Android. I hope it does well.</p>
<p>If RIM thinks an mlb.tv app is that important to have at launch, good on them (big baseball fan here). Can&rsquo;t hurt&hellip;.They just better make sure the important stuff works out of the box. Like, y&rsquo;know, email?</p>
<p>Bigger news would be a native windows 8 app for mlb.tv that will run on both windows 8 RT and win 8 versions.</p>
<p>RIM needs to license BBM and do it quick.</p>
<p>Why? Who would want it? If webOS can&#8217;t find a home, then BB isn&#8217;t going to.</p>
<p>Actually BlackBerry Messenger on all platforms might get some buy-in.</p>
<p>If they were to monetize it by charging the carriers to offer the service on their handsets and carriers either included it for free in plans or for a low-ish cost then perhaps it could be successful.</p>
<p>I like iMessage but it&#8217;s useless to non-iOS users just like BBM is useless to non-BB users. iMessage &amp; BBM both offer improvements on SMS without the full level of IM that is GTalk, MSN, etc.</p>
<p>bbm is the only reason anyone i know has a blackberry, they even admit it.</p>
<p>Exactly, having BBM on Blackberries, iOS, Androids, and even WP would be great for everyone.</p>
<p>Who would pay for it? It would be like adding another competitor to iMessage, which is NOT what you want to do with that type of model.</p>
<p>I mean, if they had applications for all platforms that would be great; just make it good and if everybody used it, everybody wins. However, if they charge by the carrier for it, it&#8217;s worthless as people will just use and pay for text messaging.</p>
<p>It has to be good AND free.</p>
<p>BBM = Blackberry Messenger, not necessarily the entire OS.</p>
<p>Although this just came across my Twitter feed: <br />
RIM to license BB10 to Samsung and HTC? <a href="http://www.phonearena.com/news/RIM-to-license-BB10-to-Samsung-and-HTC_id25457" target="_blank">http://www.phonearena.com/news/RIM-to-license-BB10-to-Samsung-and-HTC_id25457</a></p>
<p>This would be great. RIM could be that 3rd ecosystem.</p>
<p>Would someone please take this company out back and finish this?</p>
<p>As you wish</p>
<p>Get it pregnant?</p>
<p>What will being out in force to show an OS that won&#8217;t be ready for at least another 6 months do? I know I&#8217;m not a marketing guy but I just don&#8217;t see any benefit other than wasting a lot of money here.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was just designed to stop their stock price plummeting even more than it has lately.</p>
<p>Hasn&#8217;t anyone noticed the ONLY time Apple ever pre-announced a phone was the original iPhone? There&#8217;s a reason. Who wants to buy current phones, knowing that six months from now, a new one with a great new OS is coming and you may be stuck with 1.5 years left on a contract and last generation technology?</p>
<p>Microsoft figured this out &#8211; when Mango was coming, they announced all their current phones would be upgradeable.</p>
<p>Please RIM, just finish this up quick. Work hard, you&#8217;ll survive. It&#8217;s your fault for not acting sooner, and being stubborn. Can Canadians really be proud of you anymore RIM?</p>
<p>Wow, sounds just like Palm circa 2009. Oh we&#8217;ve got this awesome new OS that everyone will want when it goes on sale. Except it&#8217;s going on sale like 7 months from now.</p>
<p>Meanshile in Mountainview&#8230;</p>
<p>RIM forced to ditch qwerty and go all touch due to current competition, not very innovative</p>
<p>Man, you know things are bad at RIM when they can only make one phone for BB10. That one person is going to enjoy it. Thank you, I&#8217;ll be here all week.</p>
<p>Maybe they are taking a cue from Apple and focusing on one piece of hardware. With an open OS like Android you can&#8217;t really avoid fragmentation. But when you build the entire package in-house it would seem foolish to build competing devices.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for RIM to release their BBC or BBW oses</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Though I&#8217;m not sure who will sue them first over BBC&#8217;s trademark. BBC4u or The Crown.</p>
<p>Starting things out with only one BB10 phone actually seems to me like a step in the right direction.  Part of RIM&#8217;s problem is that the Blackberry brand is completely aimless, which in turn is in large part because RIM has watered it down with a plethora of completely forgettable, pointless devices.  My admittedly ignorant opinion is that RIM really needs to be able to say, &#8220;This is <strong>the</strong> Blackberry.  This is what it does better than any phone on the market, and this is why you <strong>need</strong> to buy one.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m of the opinion that RIM offers features that other hardware manufacturers are still unable or unwilling to offer.  That&#8217;s a good thing.  Grousing about Blackberry phones aside, there is a reason that they became so huge to begin with.</p>
<p>Show of hands: <br />
Who would buy the London shown in this photo regardless of the OS installed?</p>
<p>That phone is damn sexy.</p>
<p><strong>crickets</strong></p>
<p><b>nice..now I know how to embolden text</b></p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s determination to Osborne itself continues to impress.</p>
<p>Did RIM consult Motorola on the phone design? Or does RIM dislike corners just as much as Moto?</p>
<p>Using sharp corners prevents Apple from suing you.</p>
<p>I give RIM a thumbs up for trying  but they are so late to the game they better brings something other than a flashy OS. I think BB can survive but they keep going in the wrong direction, they need to look at there playbook,  IOS, Android, Windows. and just learn from there pros and cons. That&#8217;s what every one else is doing.  Though it seems RIM  is stubborn and stuck in there ways&#8230;&#8230;BEST OF LUCK TO THEM   I mean my mom still buys there phones, so there doing something right&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>So they will debut BB 10 next month, but the phone won&#8217;t be available until some time later this year???</p>
<p>This scenario sure sounds familiar&#8230;. sounds like HP/Palms Think Beyond crap from last year. By the time this BB 10 phone comes out later this year, no one will care; except maybe the devoted Blackberry addicts, who are more than willing to ride the Titanic until it sinks, but that&#8217;s expected.</p>
<p>Palm did this&#8230;then HP&#8230;now RIM. Why do they never learn?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for RIM to debut BB10 at MWC and hopefully it&#8217;s not just London, but also a standard BB form factor phone as well.  That would be my next phone.</p>
<p>If the picture is the actually phone and UX design, I&#8217;d say I like it. I was laughing at the comment by mikeyboom on the design of the corners. It certainly look better what Moto came out with.</p>
<p>I say BB singling out one featured phone instead of making many pointless phones is one step into the right direction. I don&#8217;t think pre-announcing a product available in 10 months is a good idea, but I understand they would have to do this to prevent their stock dropping as there will be a 10 month blank window period for them.</p>
<p>The problem with BB and HP is they make announcement too early and take too long to release the products. So when the products on the shelves, they will  just be DOA with outdated specs, buggy OS.  Look at Playbook, Palm Pre and Touchpad. Great idea with poor execution.</p>
<p>I hope BB won&#8217;t screw up this one. It might be their last chance in the smartphone market.</p>
<p>Just so there is at least something marginally interesting in a BlackBerry news post;</p>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/kym-assets/photos/images/original/000/197/580/Z3LND.gif?1320860615" /></p>
<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>Whats with the lack of corners? Hope this doesn&#8217;t become some sort of trend .</p>
<p>Well, I think, unlike the Xyboard, this is not ugly. And by the looks of it actually made out of metal.</p>
<p>What are the usage scenarios in which a company would rather license BB10 instead of QNX for mission-critical computing?</p>
<p>They wouldn&#8217;t &#8211; its a completely different usage scenario</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Who in the heck is going to license BB10?</p>
<p>Phone makers &#8211; HTC, Samsung, Nokia, .. who knows?<br />
Auto makers &#8211; BMW, Audi, Toyota, JLR,  whoever &#8211; for entertainment/media systems the same as they are licensing Airplay and similar systems</p>
<p>The Auto makers licence QNX for control and manufacturing software because it is approved for mission critical use  (unlike embedded Windows)</p>
<p>Car companies, TV manufacturers, set top box manufacturers, etc. Basically think about all the crappy user experiences you experience on a daily basis from various devices, that&#8217;s probably what they are targeting.</p>
<p>How is this guy still employed? He has it completely backwards. BB hardware is great and would do great if it ran WP8 or Android. No one wants BB software anymore and BB10 is all but already stillborn.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d maybe get a Blackberry if it came with WP8 depends on what Nokia would be offering.</p>
<blockquote>BB hardware is great</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a dogma thrown around without much substance to back it up. Granted, the top Bold models are very well made device with exceptional keyboards. However nowadays &#8220;great&#8221; hardware usually means blockbuster specs (processor, display, etc) or really noble exterior design. BB doesn&#8217;t do well in any of those.</p>
<p>In fact making good touch screen hardware has never been RIM&#8217;s strength and that&#8217;s the dilemma faced by the company. Even PlayBook was apparently mostly the job of its Taiwanese partner and most of previous RIM touch screen phones were disasters.</p>
<p>Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>RIM doesn&#8217;t do well in notable design?</p>
<p>Explain to me how the 5000 different slab touch screen phones made out of cheap disgusting materials that all look the same are more notable than the design of a blackberry bold.</p>
<p>The blackberry and bold designs are some of the most notable available. You see a bold, and you know it is a bold, and you definitely know it is a blackberry.</p>
<p>You sir are 100% delusional.</p>
<p>This is such an ironic statement coming from a standpoint trying to defend RIM. Blackberries all look the same.</p>
<p>RIM essentially re-releases the same phone over, and over, and over again. <strong>This is why they&#8217;re dying.</strong></p>
<p>You sir are Confused.. Blackberry has in the past released alot of different devices that do no look the same.. Google bold 9900, bold 9790, Torch 9810 and torch 9860.  All differnt devices and all look different.  The qwerty Keyboard phones have similar looks which i would argue is normal from a branding standpoint.</p>
<p>Disagree?  Then google Iphone 2g, 3g, 3gs, 4 and 4s. Please apply you argument to those results&#8230; Doesn&#8217;t apply. The iphone devices are all similar and model revisions are IDENTICAL (3g 3gs and 4 and 4s)</p>
<p>BB makes great Devices, but they are not on par spec wise with the highend android and apple phones that are all touch.. The old 0s 7 phones are light years ahead of the previous versions but are far behind the latest android and ios devices.</p>
<p>The real reason that rim is suffering so bad is that if failed to adjust or foresee the affect that an app ecosystem was going to have in the consumer mobile market and in having so many different models of phones all having differnt screen aspect ratios and resolutions it was near impossible to attract developers to developed apps for Blackberry because each app had to have alot of different versions in order to work on differnt models,  This has been addressed in the newest phones.</p>
<p>BB10 looks to be a great OS from what has been shown and a huge improvent from previous blackbery oses.. But this doesn&#8217;t mean they will rebound in the short term.</p>
<p>I should point out that my current phone is a s3 but i was on an bb9900 and shitty iphone 4 before that (Several replaced under warranty)</p>
<blockquote>RIM doesn’t do well in notable design?<br />
Explain to me how the 5000 different slab touch screen phones made out of cheap disgusting materials</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately for RIM, there are many companies who make touch screen phones with good quality material, much better than Storms or even Torch.</p>
<p>This is not matter of BB not being able to make good &#8220;hardware&#8221; but good &#8220;touch display hardware&#8221;. Perhaps you can change my opinion by showing me a good BB touch screen phone?</p>
<p>The 9900?</p>
<p>This is coming from an iPhone and Android user</p>
<p>the 9900 is a great touchscreen BB. Same goes for the 9790 and 9760.</p>
<p>9900 is a portrait keyboard phone augmented with a touch screen. What I meant was a touch screen slab phone which is the majority of the market today.</p>
<p>The point many out there don&#8217;t get, is, that it&#8217;s all about software. RIM never made superior alltouch phones because the classic BlackBerry OS isn&#8217;t capable to stack up with iOS, Android or even WP. It&#8217;s just old-fashioned and not made for that purpose. And that is also the reason why you can&#8217;t foresee the quality of upcoming BB10-Phones by having a look at past ones. BB10 will be completely different. The UI and navigation will be absolutely revolutional and fast. Also QNX brings unique features to the table. It&#8217;ll be simply high-tech instead of one more iOS-Rip-off. And as we talk about hardware, I think that point is more about built quality instead of just specs. That&#8217;s also a point many &#8211; like u &#8211; don&#8217;t get. The chipset must power the software, not more. No operating system out there needs quad core CPUs (except Android, which also manages to lag around when it&#8217;s fired up by quad core CPUs) And BB10 gets the S4 Krait (which in some benchmarks outperforms the Tegra 3), 28nm dual core 1.5 or 1.7 GHz. Thats by far enough and it&#8217;ll be great. Beside of that is the awesome display, 4.2&quot; and 356 PPI (no display out there has this pixel desity), the perfect compromise between wideness and one-handed ease of use. On the top don&#8217;t forget the quality of the other hardware parts. Battery life, receiving and sending data, camera, sound quality etc. Also points where high-end BlackBerrys always score. So wait and see. By the way there is no worse scenario to imagine as if RIM would adopt Android&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll agree with your post except  the specs part, dunno how you came across those but the worst case scenario is BlackBerry going with WP8</p>
<p>I simply think that the Android competition is too hard. The only Android-manufacturer that really makes profits is Samsung, just because of their economy of scale and their large marketing budget.<br />
For the hardware:<br />
1. Display<br />
Here you can pick the one of the Dev Alpha device. 4,2&quot;, 1280 &#215; 786 resolution. Because both size and resolution are critical for RIMs new navigation paradigm (one-handed) and the software testing.<br />
2. Chipset<br />
Last year they said they&#8217;re waiting for a dual core chipset, with a world-LTE/HSPA+ combi-chip, which is very energy-efficient. But that chipset shouldn&#8217;t be available until mid-2012. Here you go, this is Qualcomms MSM8960 (at least, probably its even the MSM8960 Pro with Adreno 320 GPU) for 95% I think. Also Windows Phone 8 will bet on these Chips. I think it&#8217;s a really good choice.<br />
3. Rear-facing camera<br />
8 MP &#8211; also here you can pick the one of the Dev Alpha.<br />
4. Browser<br />
Ok, no specs here, I just remembered that and wanted to say it. You can already find the BlackBerry 10 browser on html5test.com, where it scores 447 points, plus bonus points. There even is no desktop browser currently out there which can stack up with this.</p>
<p>Revolutional &#8230; LOL.</p>
<p>But seriously, all that and I still can&#8217;t see a reason to switch. All the hoopla about QNX and I don&#8217;t see what it does FOR ME. Will it have all the features of a modern OS? How about apps? How about a well developed media store to buy music and movies? Is it stable? All these unanswered questions that we can&#8217;t know until this thing it&#8217;s a released but BlackBerry fans think they know.</p>
<p>Sorry, revolutionARY, I&#8217;m german ;-P</p>
<p>There is a music store, and in canada there&#8217;s already a video store. Just have a look at the PlayBook OS. Also you get deep messaging integration, photo and perhaps videoediting out-of-the box. In case of apps, the tablet ones should be compatible, there are already 40,000 and growing and RIM is also working on the 100 most important for launch. And yes, it should be stable, just because of QNX, you see that already on the PlayBook. Each application runs in its own sandbox. Even when an app crashes that doen&#8217;t effect the overall system, it simply can&#8217;t. And I bet BB10 will be a big improvement over the current PlayBook OS.</p>
<p>I love my Playbook.. I can attest that it is more stable then my s3.. My touchwiz launcher stends to freeze or crash from time to time.</p>
<p>The playbook needs apps..  BUT all the current apps will run on bb10 (already confirmed) and will also allow ported androids apps to be packaged to run on bb10.</p>
<p>This. A Bold 9900 and Torch 9860 looking android devices would sell. But not those Dev Alpha devices because that hardware looks like an iPhone 4 to me.</p>
<p>As you say it on your own: that are Dev Alpha devices. They are simply shrunken PlayBooks for developers to test their apps on. They&#8217;re not for sale and no BB10 phone will ever like like them.</p>
<p>Incorrect.  I want BlackBerry hardware and software.  I would NOT by any other platform in any form.</p>
<p>I second that.</p>
<p>That makes two. I can hear the cheers from Waterloo.</p>
<p>I wonder if HTC are desperate enough yet?</p>
<p>Nokia?</p>
<p>And yes, I do want BB10 on my PB! It is a great piece of hardware with great QNX OS. It just needs some apps support which will hopefully arrive with BB10. Havin&#8217;g experience QNX first hand, I can no longer bash BB for sticking with it. Some features are gorgeous, they just need to polish it a bit more with BB10.</p>
<p>By the time you get BB10 on your PB, you will have owned that tablet through two generations of iPads and will still be waiting for application parity.  If you hang on to it for 3 or 4 more years, you may get Netflix.</p>
<p>Valid points.. But they playbooks is extremely fast and the same games on the ipad 3 and playbooks running around the same FPS&#8230;</p>
<p>Some forget out ios was missing some many common features that my bb pearl had .  It annoyed me to no end when i made the switch to the 3g.  copy and paste?? really come one.. MMS was missing.. And you still can&#8217;t customize or theme ios unless you start jailbreaking it.  Android has IOS beat hands down.  The s3 is super fast with out lag&#8230; when touch wiz hasn&#8217;t locked up on me :)</p>
<p>They are stuck in a contract with MS to stay WP8 exclusive unfortunately.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this kind of move hasn&#8217;t worked in the past. Apple, Palm and NeXT all licensed their OSs — Apple and Palm were undercut by competitors, NeXT had to get out of the hardware business altogether, and if you want to add webOS to the mix, it doesn&#8217;t seem anybody took HP/Palm up on the offer to license. In a world where ecosystems are what matters, I don&#8217;t know that OSs have much bearing on any of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced that the only way RIM gets out of the mess is through hardware and services and the software that powers it, not by selling the software itself. This OS licensing is nothing but a sideshow.</p>
<p>The licensing scenario won&#8217;t work for RIM. Why? First, it would open up security issues which many of RIM&#8217;s customers won&#8217;t like. Second, is any OEM willing to invest in BB10? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>To elaborate on security, one reason why the military and other BB customers aren&#8217;t interested in Android or WP is because those operating systems aren&#8217;t kept behind lock and key. RIM is a security first company, and they would piss off many of their customers if they go down the licensing route.</p>
<p>Yeah, the military is in no way <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2406530,00.asp" target="new">interested in Android phones</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, never knew of that. But the US military isn&#8217;t the only one using BBs. Other security-conscious organizations use it too, and if BB10 opens up to OEMs, RIM will significantly lose mindshare.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t make that case when your president uses BB.</p>
<p>And what case do you think I&#8217;m making? I said the military is interested in Android phones. In English, that means &#8220;the military is interested in Android phones&#8221;.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s choice in smartphone is completely unrelated to this topic. I suppose since he&#8217;s a BB Guy, they&#8217;re going to deny shipment of the thousands of Atrix phones <em>that they ordered</em>. I look forward to seeing this in the Corrections in tomorrow&#8217;s newspaper.</p>
<p>Get fucking real. If you aren&#8217;t going to bother with reading a thread, don&#8217;t bother commenting in it.</p>
<p>Or if you paid attention to <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3125517/android-motorola-army-network" target="new">The Verge</a> in the past month and a half&#8230;</p>
<p>As Jimbo stated below the military are actually interested in Android (Remember the Verge posted about it?) WP wasn&#8217;t chosen because I guess it wasn&#8217;t as extensible as Android, meaning it couldn&#8217;t be customized to the military&#8217;s liking as Android could, same with iOS. Btw WP is even more secure than Android, iOS and RIM.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like Android&#8217;s Open Sourciness was a possible advantage to the Military.</p>
<p>What complete bull WP is not more secure. Pal I know you like Microsoft and blowing your WP trumpet at any opportunity but what you are saying here is completely wrong. WP wasn&#8217;t chosen because it was insecure. It currently has no device encryption at all, meaning if somebody got a hold of the device they can read the contents on the phone with 100% certainty without doing much at all.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t this the ultimate plan of the last co-CEOs?</p>
<p>Jim Balsille wanted to turn RIM into a services company, and make BB email and BBM available for iOS and Android at a charge. Thorsten still wants to sell Blackberries.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sweet RIM think BB10 is actually going to make it to market.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious, what do you think software devs at RIM are doing?</p>
<p>The 2 things people want from blackberry is their security and BBM. They should scrap their OS, continue making hardware and work with Windows.</p>
<p>Add: Offer BBM to other platforms as well and sell it in their marketplaces while offering the best in text security communications. Shit I&#8217;ll buy it for 20$.</p>
<p>If BBM is $1 it will be the most expensive SMS alternative app for any device on any platform.  iMessage is free, but iOS only.  All the cross-platform ones are free.</p>
<p>Now if RIM could get Apple to license iMessage to them, they might have something.  As it is, BBM is dying as fast as RIM is.  (Though I hear they&#8217;re growing by leaps and bounds in Africa).</p>
<p>I think the wall street type will want BBM for their really secure messaging. I don&#8217;t think iMessage comes close to that type of security. I may be wrong though.</p>
<p>Anyone else thinks Thornstein looks like Scarecrow (i.e., Cilian Murphy) from Nolan&#8217;s Batman?</p>
<p>Now that you mention it&#8230;</p>
<p>This can&#8217;t be unseen.</p>
<p>Yes, it totally does.</p>
<p>Now they just need to find someone who wants to license it.</p>
<p>This is just an option. And options are good, both for RIM and OEM.</p>
<p>Licensing the OS isn&#8217;t going to make it any less secure. Licensing doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re handing the source out to third parties. Blackberries remain just as secure as they&#8217;ve always been they can license without compromising security. I would say that selling consumer blackberries by the millions is just as bad as licensing the OS.</p>
<p>The secret to RIM&#8217;s and BlackBerries&#8217; security is BES and BIS. Everything is encrypted at the server level. Also, enterprises will still have access to other security features regardless of what devices run BB10.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they should scrap their OS and license BBM to other platforms.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine why you&#8217;d want to though</p>
<p>Licensing BB10 will be a big win for all those manufacturers that are tired of Google&#8217;s exorbitant fees on Android&#8230; oh, wait&#8230;</p>
<p>Licensing BB10 will be a big win for all those manufacturers that don&#8217;t want to compete with Microsoft&#8217;s new hardware design and prefer an OS vendor with no hardware plans of their own&#8230; oh, wait&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe Nokia will license it now that their platform is on fire again.</p>
<p><img src="http://brucemhood.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/manwithheadinsand.jpg?w=424&h=283" /></p>
<p>They should put it in PRINTERS!</p>
<p>LG, Smart appliances, smart home, smart car etc. Sony will probably license it as well to buffer against Windows 8 and it&#8217;s connections to xBox</p>
<p>I&#8217;m amazed at the lack of faith in tech. So many want rim to go with android, some want them to sell off the company. Some want them to give up altogether. No other company can go up against the big 3 and snag that third spot away from win fone but rim. No one else has the experience to do it right like rim does. They dropped the ball before, they won&#8217;t again. I hope rim makes it and I hope more companies keep on innovating and making great software outside of ios and android. I support innovation and after using a play book for a while rim is on the right path with qnx. None of these os&#8217;s were built in a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big 3&#8221;?  Who are you talking about?  Palm, Microsoft and Symbian?  Not exactly &#8220;big&#8221;.  They certainly didn&#8217;t steal third place from the group of Apple, Google and Microsoft, because they were far more popular before Apple and Google even entered the game.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like for RIM to survive, but I&#8217;m not hopeful that they will.  BB10 needed to be released at the start of this year (or late last year), not at the end.  With the company shedding engineers, they might not even release it this year.</p>
<p>$10,000/a year is ridiculously little.</p>
<p>Agreed, but I assume their kicker will be the fact that people will put in the touted 1-2 days of porting effort to get their iOS/Android apps onto BB10 for the $10,000. It doesn&#8217;t sound so little then.</p>
<p>And then you have to support the thing, and issue free updates, and reply to angry emails from customers. App development is a job with responsibilities, I fear this move will attract high school developers. No one else will want to play.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re replying to that many angry emails from customers, you should probably do a better job on the app.</p>
<p>Customers are angry by default. You should check out the Internet.</p>
<p>Everyone on the internet is angry by default?</p>
<p>Yes, unless they go to Internet Options and change the default settings.</p>
<p>I assume you need to run as admin&#8230;</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>What? Yes, a good chunk of people on the Internet is angry by default. Some of them are good–angry, because they are opinionated and they feel let down from the world, others are angry from ignorance.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to agree to disagree. I can only go by experience of actually releasing apps and not having had any significant number of emails complaining about them. I myself, as have other devs I know, find that most people stick to complaining about things in the review section instead of taking the time to email. I&#8217;ll take my experience over the generalisation of 2 billion people.</p>
<p><strong>hi-five</strong></p>
<p>Well (s)he might be right, but I&#8217;ll need more evidence to convince me that my experiences with apps have all be anomalies.</p>
<p>The funnier thing here is that it&#8217;s not hard to show and prove what you are saying.  Hell, I AM A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF THIS.  When I figured out your were a dev, I didn&#8217;t break out in some kind of crazy rage, I wanted to know more about stuff that you are going to release.</p>
<p>Im a dev and have my email address on my website.  People email me all the time to ask about programs, to request new features, and sometimes to tell me how great the app is&#8230;  In fact, I&#8217;ve never had a complaint in over 2 years&#8230;</p>
<p> I&#8217;ll stick with my experience instead of assuming everyone on the internet is out to bash your stuff&#8230;   If people are constantly complaining about your app, have you ever thought that you probably deserve it??</p>
<p>Thats my experience too even when someone finds a bug its usually a message saying first of all great app and secondly I found a bug.</p>
<p>Why are those groups mutually exclusive? If anything, I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s going to be a lot of overlap between &#8220;good-angry&#8221; and ignorant angry.</p>
<p>Sadly agree, yesterday I read an online magazine article about a woman who donated eggs (for profit), sharing her experiences with the hormones required etc.</p>
<p>Readers of this fairly long article ripped her apart in comments, from the extreme grammar nazis who picked up on a few grammatical errors, &#8220;this is a disgrace and beings the whole media operations brand into utter shame&#8221; and &#8220;the two or three errors among the thousands of words ruined the whole thing, I&#8217;m so aggravated&#8230;.I won&#8217;t be able to sleep tonight&#8221; etc, through to what a filthy&#8230;&#8230;person&#8230;&#8230; the author was, and how people should just adopt rather than paying someone (anonymously through doctors etc) for her eggs.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t a single positive or even fair comment to be found</p>
<p>No one&#8217;s doubting that there are angry people on the internet. You can find nasty comments, but you can also find decent comments. The majority of comments on this site alone are constructive and well-natured, otherwise there&#8217;d be no use for the commenting system and it would be removed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just saying that these people, in my experience at least, don&#8217;t go to the trouble of downloading an app that&#8217;s generally considered good by the majority and send so many emails it makes $10,000 look like a pittance.</p>
<p>I like most comments on The Verge as a whole, absolutely, but :</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The majority of comments on this site alone are constructive and well-natured, otherwise there’d be no use for the commenting system and it would be removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve never seen music video comments on YouTube then, eh? :-)</p>
<p>Actually, I find them highly informative and I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised at how the dislike bar signifies many many things depending on the video playing&#8230;.. :D</p>
<p>Well it certainly won&#8217;t attract me. I could definitely use $10000 for university, but I don&#8217;t want RIM giving me $10000 for what basically boils down to marketing.</p>
<p>Who else &#8220;guarantees&#8221; 10k?  I think it&#8217;s a pretty slick move.</p>
<p>10k is near "easy money" territory on the App Store.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>No, 10k is 10k.  If all I have to do is port an app over that allegedly works on Android, too, I&#8217;d say that you&#8217;re right and that&#8217;s some damn &#8220;easy money&#8221;.  But it&#8217;s guaranteed easy money, which ought to show that RIM is ready to actually connect with developers and provide a safety net for the time and resources they&#8217;d otherwise feel like they&#8217;re wasting.</p>
<p>Easy money, maybe.  Still money? Of course it is.  And there&#8217;s absolutely nothing bad about that.  Where I come from, 10k is nearly 1/3 of what most of my friends make in a year.  I think it&#8217;s a pretty generous offer.</p>
<p>I was already developing my first app for Android, I think that I&#8217;ll invest the time to port it simultaneously to BBW. A year from release I should have 10K no matter what. Either my app will be excellent and sell in the ecosystem or I&#8217;ll have to struggle to make it succeed and RIM will allow me to fight in development longer than I had planned.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely not a bad offer for independent developers who have a day job and write apps on the weekends. I&#8217;ve put a lot of free time into apps that made dramatically less than $10,000.</p>
<p>What app is yours?</p>
<p>this</p>
<p>I&#8217;m no dev, but I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s the idea here.  Indies with regular jobs.  That&#8217;s how most of the most famous apps out there got started, right?  And it seems like $10,000 is what RIM is going to call the bare minimum that you can expect to make in the first year, and anything after that bonus money is just more bonus money.</p>
<p>A needed move.  I imagine they&#8217;ll only authorize apps that they think have a chance of making at least some money.  No theme packs allowed, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>Ah, the Microsoft strategy. Well, almost.<br />
Regardless, it reeks of desperation. I can smell it all the way over here in England.</p>
<p>Does it matter though? If this gets more Devs doesn&#8217;t that make the experience better?</p>
<p>It does if, in the end, they&#8217;re basically buying their way to limited success by having the right apps and desperately hoping that consumers buy handsets(that are, let&#8217;s face it, will probably be outdated by the time they go on sale )<br />
It obviously doesn&#8217;t matter too much to RIM, but one should have pride in how they succeed. The problem is that RIM&#8217;s just too late.</p>
<p>ALL of that is subjective and unfounded.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of ANY blackberry product since I was introduced to BIS/BES hell at my job even with that being the case, on a consumer level, no on is late in a market like the US when the current split of smartphone to dumb phones is 50/50.</p>
<blockquote>It obviously doesn’t matter too much to RIM, but one should have pride in how they succeed.</blockquote>
<p>What?  I believe most Brits would call that comment daft.</p>
<p>Is this the first time a company has ever provided incentives for  people to work with their product? <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303916904577375502392129654.html?mod=WSJ_Tech_LEFTTopNews">Hell didn&#8217;t Microsoft sweeten the pot with the B&N deal by offering $180M in guaranteed revenue-sharing?</a>  <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2010-04-28/tech/30050270_1_siri-mobile-platforms-search-business">Didn&#8217;t Apple buy Siri?</a></p>
<p>The vast majority  of android users are not at all loyal to the platform.  It lags and has terrible battery life, as well as providing inconsistent experiences across devices and apps.  Consumer satisfaction ratings with the vast majority of android devices are really low.  They are ripe for the taking by any competitor, even apple.</p>
<p>I really think that Heins gets what wasn&#8217;t working for them.  They already know how to make great hardware, and the phones will HAVE TO have great specs if apps will be running in the background.</p>
<p>The OS looks to be intuitive and innovative with their strong focus on gestures.  All that will be left are apps.  And in the chicken and egg debacle of apps and customers, cold hard cash should do a great job of alleviating that</p>
<p>&#8220;They already know how to make great hardware&#8221;</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen anything compelling come out of RIM in years. If by &#8220;great&#8221; hardware you mean rehashes of last year&#8217;s product then I guess I could agree.</p>
<p>Sending in my fart app right now&#8230; (I think that iOS has proven these apps are not useless at all.)</p>
<p>$10.000 in da bank.. BAZINGA!</p>
<p>Make sure it has a timer. That&#8217;s the feature that makes fart apps useful around my office.</p>
<p>Sorry to tell you, but those noises aren&#8217;t coming from apps&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see they have any alternative. This will likely appeal to small/homebrew developers but they sure aren&#8217;t going to lure the likes to Rovio, Netflix and others with 10k.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not their target. Those developers will easily make 10x that profit just off name alone. It&#8217;s not for the developing giants, it&#8217;s for soon to be developers,  and those niche app devs.</p>
<p>Unless porting existing apps to BB10  is very straight forward, I think it more likely larger developers will ignore the platform until it establishes a fair sized userbase. But these are the exact developers RIM needs to give incentives too, just as Microsoft have done for WP7.</p>
<p>I think one of the conditions is that your app has to make at least $1,000 on its own before it can be eligible (ie it has to prove it has some sales generating capabilities).</p>
<p>A good move. Hopefully they add terms to force those Android devs to make their ports native.</p>
<p>And if that&#8217;s the truth, then that&#8217;s really smart.  If QNX can run apk&#8217;s then there&#8217;s a cost-effective reward for bringing an app to BB10</p>
<p>Research says BlackBerry users spend more than those on iOS and Android. Having a premium app in App World is already proving to be profitable for developers. 10k will come easy</p>
<p>I do believe that that statistic was per user (please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong), and there is a lot less BlackBerry / PlayBook users than iOS / Android.</p>
<p>Not to mention that apps on AppWorld for the PlayBook are $4.99 where the Android/iOS version are only $0.99.</p>
<p>You basically need an app to be sorta successful ($1000 in revenues) in order to &#8220;win&#8221; the $9,000.  The more it sells, the less RIM pays out.  So RIM only pays when the apps are in the $1000-10,000 revenue range. Of course, you&#8217;ll be &#8220;happy&#8221; if your app makes $10K on its own, and that is what RIM is counting  on. However, the key here is whether it worth your effort to gain $10,000 from a port or $10,000 by sticking to your current platforms (status quo). There is an opportunity cost.</p>
<p>What? I have no idea what you&#8217;re trying to say here, BB position is simple, stick a good app on our platform and you will get at least $10,000 that&#8217;s not a bad situation to be in. How is it relevant that they aren&#8217;t paying out if you make more than this, why should they, they want to get small developers onto the platform, so they don&#8217;t end up in the WP7 situation of receiving constant criticism for lack of apps.  I also have no idea what <blockquote>whether it worth your effort to gain $10,000 from a port or $10,000 by sticking to your current platforms</blockquote> could possibly mean. Where is there a suggestion of making $10,000 by not making a port, yes there would be some financial outlay involved, but it wouldn&#8217;t exclude people from other developments, and it comes with a guaranteed return. The maths is pretty simple, whether this was a smart move by BB will simple come down to how much they have to pay out, and whether they can afford it.</p>
<p>Premium used to mean $15 for f&#8217;in Adobe Reader on BB.  If they pull that stunt with what should be cheap/free/core apps then I will be disappointed.</p>
<p>This is quite a smart move because it encourages those that aren&#8217;t familiar with BB dev. Once you&#8217;ve created an eligible app (i.e. has some quality), you&#8217;re likely to be more confident with the BB SDK and, in turn, may consider porting to it for future apps. Seems like a good idea, but will be interesting to see how it actually plays out.</p>
<p>1. Make BB10 fart app<br />
2. ???<br />
3. PROFIT!</p>
<p>If they dont come on their own, Bribe them!!!  Worked out for Microsoft right!?!?</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>Yes, when you have developers moving away from a platform, or when they don&#8217;t exist on the platform, you are going to have a hard time gaining users.</p>
<p>Of course you have to pony up and help convince developers to port over.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not going to get app developers whose only pay check comes from their apps they make focus on a platform that is not Android or iOS&#8230;bottom line.   These developers don&#8217;t choose which platform they develop on just for fun.</p>
<p>Now it becomes a question of how many of BlackBerry&#8217;s 77M users they can convince to stay loyal and upgrade to a BB10 phone as early adopters (it&#8217;s usually cheaper to keep a customer than it is to get a new one).</p>
<p>Not aimed at you, but I&#8217;d just like to point out, when we mention RIM products being used by &#8220;77 million people&#8221;, we should keep in mind Apples sales of over ten million iPhones each month, with Samsung selling a similar number throughout its range of phones, combined with all the also ran companies.</p>
<p>Having near 80 million users is only 8 months of iPhone sales alone.  Throw in iPad, iPod Touch, and the entire Android gamut and it&#8217;s freaking nothing at all.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say that it&#8217;s nothing. It&#8217;s still more than the 3DS and the original PSP. It&#8217;s not a dedicated gaming device like those but it allows software developers to target a different market that hungers for extensibility via 3rd party software.</p>
<p>Straws clutched&#8230; next?</p>
<p>Sorry, but niche gaming platforms where software is highly profitable compares very poorly to phones where the money is in the hardware. Devs looking for money will aim for the big markets &#8211; iOS then Android. Remember, those 70-80M are all on BB7 and are effectively orphaned from BB10. BB10 user base is a million or so PB users.</p>
<p>This is the slickest move from a company yet. Well done. Their new CEO might make the difference.</p>
<p>10k isn&#8217;t much really if you are a professional developer.  An app could easily cost that much to create and maintain in a year when you take into account the overhead associated with apps.</p>
<p>10k is great for a fart app.</p>
<p>10K? RIM is very desperate. The TOS basically mean this is a publicity stunt. You&#8217;re not going to make $1000/year on a platform that has literally zero users right now, and RIM either knows it or the &#8220;Wake Up.&#8221; campaign was even more ironic than we thought. Nobody will get their 10k.</p>
<p>Hell that man looks evil!  Would you trust an &#8220;intellectual villain&#8221; stock character?</p>
<p>Sounds like a meme, &#8220;bro, you know I&#8217;m good for the 10K I owe you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Introducing the Blackberry $10,000!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get wise people.<br />
RIM is playing a marketing game, and playing it brilliantly. RIM knowns the Blackberry 10 platforms needs apps, so they come out with the Playbook (much like Apple with the iTouch) these use the playbook to get a good # of apps on the app world, beyond that they enable the Android Runtime within OS 2.0 which then led to thousand of pirated .APK&#8217;s to be converted for use on the Playbook and NO DEVELOPER wanted to see that Instead of letting their money get ripped off&#8212;they&#8217;re all WAKING UP to the ease of platform conversion.. And  now they time release their TRULY native Cascades SDK to allow for everyone and their mother to build apps for a platform they won&#8217;t release until later this year. All the time until the release of BB10 is time waiting for the APP selection to not be the kink that breaks BB1o&#8217;s back. They KNOW they have an app issue, common. They&#8217;ve been in this since &#8216;99. Acquiring QNX and TAT was the smartest move. (especially seeing as TAT were the ones who revamped the original FUGLY looking android into what all you android users knew in loved back when it was first released. This incentive is icing on an already decked up cake. Blackberry is throwing all it has, this is it&#8217;s hail mary. (or so we&#8217;ll see)</p>
<p>you forgot to add the /s</p>
<p>Playbook &#8211; unmitigated disaster<br />
BB10 &#8211; almost no chance of success no matter how good the eventual device(s) is.<br />
Android APKs on BB PB &#8211; weak at best</p>
<p>You massively overestimate RIM&#8217;s smarts here. The business mechanics are beyond RIM&#8217;s capabilities now. Even MS is struggling with their bottomless resources. The scale at which they need to success, the difficulty of leveraging their BB7 customers into BB10 (kids are moving to whatsapp and iMessage) and the limited time they have to do it before the money runs out (add 2 more horrific quarters to this last one before any BB10 cash trickles in) means they really are doing a hail mary. How often do those work out?<br />
TAT/QNX might have been smart purchases in 2007, the minute they saw the iPhone but it is too late now. Their market is mostly kids on cheap Curve&#8217;s all over the world, using BBM, and a few remaining business people who are swapping them for iPhones at the first opportunity. BYOD is killing BB in the enterprise and there is probably no way back.</p>
<p>I think you forgot the celebrities ( <a href="http://celebrityblackberrysightings.com/category/berrysightings/" target="_blank">http://celebrityblackberrysightings.com/category/berrysightings/</a> ) in your analysis of the user base &#8211; the most recent one being Katie Holmes :)</p>
<p>More seriously, I just think your take on this is simply too grim, and linear &#8211; not unlike that Borg picture of yours. In the MDM-BYOD world, they have a nice new product which supports iOS, Android and their devices and which can leverage existing infrastructures and which was very positively reviewed recently. Their financial results were not stellar but still within the market expectations. They have a strong brand with a good reputation. Their Playbook was not a commercial success but with their second release of their OS The Verge gave it 6.7 on 10, which is better than some well known brand devices. Now they have a new OS, financial incentives for developers &#8211; even though it&#8217;s about a few good apps really and not about numbers, a new management. It&#8217;s not about beating iOS or Android or WP7. It&#8217;s about scaling up on innovation and integration. It&#8217;s a game that plays on the mid-long term. The idea that 20 years from now we&#8217;ll have the same players in the same position is simplistic, and shows a lack of perspective, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Not only did RIM rip off webOS, are they trying to rip off HP Veer too with that thing?</p>
<p>That dev device looks more like an iPhone than any Android device there is right now. Where are Apple&#8217;s lawyers? haha j/k</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t look like an iPhone, it does look like a PlayBook mini. And by accident, it remembers of an iPhone, too. Anyway, this is a dev device and it&#8217;ll never hit the market.</p>
<p>so when can developers run bb10 on their playbook?</p>
<p>BB10 isn&#8217;t supposed to be out until after the phones that will be running them, so february?</p>
<p>At earliest&#8230;they&#8217;ll be very focused on getting their two new phones out in Jan/Feb, so I would bet on March/April, personally.</p>
<p>or you can do the work around and put the current BB10 beta version on your PlayBook via forums around the internet, there is a how-to on CrackBerry.com</p>
<p>Awesome, great to know! thanks!</p>
<p>If they give dev&#8217;s $10,000 each, they&#8217;re going to flop even faster. I give RIM credit for staying in for the long run, but they&#8217;re seriously beating a dead horse at this point.</p>
<p>They wont be giving them 10 000 each. They told the devs that if they make a good app(that&#8217;s certified by RIM) and they don&#8217;t make 10 000, RIM will give them the difference.</p>
<p>Does this include if BB10 doesn&#8217;t launch?</p>
<p>Looks nice. Hope it will thrive for competition is good. Wonder if Apple is going to say that this looks like their phones. ;-)</p>
<p>Considering most dev devices are usually ugly, I wouldn&#8217;t brag.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t believe people are talking about the generic looks of the development device while this is about the software dev kits and apps. After September no more changes will be made to the API and it seems they&#8217;re right on track for their release early next year&#8230; plus they will post the set of features they&#8217;re working on for the final sdk with details so looking forward to see that&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope the final device looks like that, very simple and clean like Apple&#8217;s devices.</p>
<p>I kinda just want rim to give up.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re just rebooting buddy. Hang on for the ride. The potential to be number 3 is there. They aren&#8217;t going anywhere</p>
<p>&#8220;they arent going anywhere&#8221;</p>
<p>True. But lets be honest here &#8211; they&#8217;ll be in the market, but as #4. There is no way they can compete with Microsoft as they throw Money into WP &amp; Marketing like crazy. BB can&#8217;t afford that. But thats ok. Blackberry has a solid userbase &#8211; and it always will have.</p>
<p>When the OS and the hardware are good, there&#8217;s no need to throw endless amounts of dollars at marketing activities. Then they&#8217;ll go their way. At least, BB10 will be something totally different from anything that has been out there before.</p>
<p>You right about this.  Granted that the blackberry brand has taken a hit in north america and they will survive. What you don&#8217;t her is how huge they are internationally. South America and Europe.  One point I want to make is that in many third world countries energy power is limited and blackberries last for days on a single charge as oppose to apple and android phones.</p>
<p>Yeah great, only shitty toy-phones like your droid left on the market then, what a great world. If that&#8217;s the case, it all depends on microsoft if we&#8217;ll get real smartphones again or not.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for those SuperApps.</p>
<p>Most exciting news this year in mobile is definitely going to be BB 10 and WP8.</p>
<p>You mean next year for BB10&#8230;</p>
<p>Nice Rim job&#8230;whoops, nice job, Rim.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so excited for BB10</p>
<p>Lol, I don&#8217;t understand how blackberry is still surviving :&#8217;)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an apple fanboy but I want blackberry 10 to be a hit. Since webos is no longer an option for mainstream America at least we still have 4 options to choose instead of 3</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with Matias Duarte with this one. There is a market for phones with physical keyboard. I just hope they make it a webOS styled OS. Touch and Type. Gestures. Well designed and intuitive interface. really simple sdk. but unfortunately. those things are easier said than done</p>
<p>Watching the tech demo from their last event, BB10 is going to be amazing. RIM has a real shot to absolutely rip tho industry a new one. Really hope though that they pay attention and don&#8217;t miss some key features.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing what they come up with!</p>
<p>FaceBerry. </p>
<p>BlackTime</p>
<p>BlackFace</p>
<p>wait wut.</p>
<p>Need a caption on the picture there &#8220;Yo, it&#8217;s me, reinstalling faith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;File not found. Faith install failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can put that on the device&#8217;s screen. I&#8217;m talking about the caption for the picture itself.</p>
<p>Someone please tell me, I am actually interested, why BBM matters at all?  Whatsapp, Google+ Messenger, Facebook Messenger (Beluga) etc etc etc all work very well.  Not secure, but well and cross platform.</p>
<p>What has BBM got that these have not?</p>
<p>Fanatical users who don&#8217;t wan&#8217;t to leave the BlackBerry &#8216;ecosystem&#8217;.</p>
<p>Or maybe we&#8217;re just people who like using our BlackBerrys.</p>
<p>That is not a reason BBM is good though.  I have often asked people, I even got a BB Curve &#8211; but the thing is horrific to use.  I cannot even set up IMAP e-mail on my data contract without paying RIM.  Pay RIM to use my e-mail, on my blackberry, on my SIM.</p>
<p>That aside, I really want to know what it has going for it.  I love these topics.</p>
<p>Trust me if you are gonna use a Blackberry never use a curve, you&#8217;ll get a better experience with the Bold and Torch lineup.</p>
<p>Simply the OS.  I&#8217;m one of those types who loves to toy with the OS of things.</p>
<p>Fantastic group support, file transfer support, integration into the OS&#8230; I can go on&#8230;</p>
<p>Please do.  File transfer sounds actually useful, the rest is not unique.</p>
<p>maybe it&#8217;s not unique feature to feature but altogether is pretty decent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that those things are available is most group messengers on Android by default because of the system level share function.</p>
<p>This is not a * vs * topic for me, I&#8217;ve seen people go nuts for BBM but no one has yet told me why.  If RIM want people like me to consider their platform they need to explain why, not just tell us their users understand.</p>
<p>My sister was VERY hard rpessed to move away from Blackberry (28) until she got an iPhone 4.  Complained for 2 weeks and now cant believe she used BB at all.  Similar for an older friend moving to an Xperia Android set.</p>
<p>There must be a reason for the hardcore users though, and I want to understand it.</p>
<p>Are you asking about just BBM or BlackBerrys in general?  In terms of BBM, I use it and like it but it&#8217;s not a big deal to me.  Now my overall Blackberry experience?  That&#8217;s a much bigger thing for me.</p>
<p>BBM.  I am not interested in convincing anyone to like another platform, but personally I have found BB OS to be a horrendous experience.  I think mine is stuck at 5.x though.  The Torches at work are fairly universally loathed though.</p>
<p>What you prefer is down to you.  I just wonder why this one (seemingly clunky and ugly) messenger system is so beloved.  Suspecting it may be down to the fact it is a major component of the brand.  The major flaw being lack of use with friends on other platforms.  (Same with iMessage which is why I do not mention it earlier).</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/zoAXWd6qFgc" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/zoAXWd6qFgc</a></p>
<p>This is BBM in 2012.  the video is from 2012, I had to check that to be sure.</p>
<p>From my experience its one of the best messenger apps on a mobile device, I would actually pay for it to use it on other OS.</p>
<p>But again, I keep asking specifically.  Why?</p>
<p>Its really hard to explain, if you use it for a extended period you see it has a lot of advantages over other messenger apps such as features and functionality, its very straight forward and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s something.  The thing is I have found that (for example) Whatsapp is also very simple and has plenty of functionality such as sending audio, video, location data.  It&#8217;s just that you can do so across 4 platforms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting to suppose the draw is the known security and plain familiarity to the userbase.  Probably nothing outstanding if directly compared.</p>
<p>Heins says, &quot;That&#8217;s why we want to build on that strength, and that&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t want to share that strength. &quot;</p>
<p>That &#8220;strength&#8221; already exists on current Blackberry phones, and that&#8217;s not stopping their market free fall. If it&#8217;s not helping how, what makes him think it&#8217;s going to help later?</p>
<p>I can say its better than whats app, facebook messenger, pingchat as it comes to features, i havent used google+ though.</p>
<p>So if I say feature wise I can send image, video, audio, location and contact and have send + delivery receipts, what could you add that BBM has?  File send was mentioned and that is actually quite enticing.</p>
<p>Integration into many other blackberry apps and the phone itself I guess. I am less familiar with other message services.</p>
<p>Android sort of covers that by having OS level sharing between applications.  But built in is also nice.  Possibly better depending on specific implementation.</p>
<p>One thing with BBM (I just thought of this after seeing your reply) is that it&#8217;s always on. Because it&#8217;s (for the most part) built in to the OS, once it&#8217;s set up, you can just use it. There&#8217;s no logging in to anything. As soon as your BB is up and running so is BBM.</p>
<p>I think that is is true of all of these messenger systems on all OSs, though I dunno about Symbian or Windows Phone 7.  Certainly is on my Android unit.</p>
<p>True for Symbian &#8211; doh.</p>
<p>You can play games with contacts, group calender syncing, set appointments with contacts, as you said you can send any type of file, you can share contacts, send an email the entire chat (dunno if that&#8217;s a big deal). That&#8217;s all I can think of.</p>
<p>Thanks for humoring me on this.  It sounds like BBM really is popular for those who use it, because they use it.  Same for many other systems.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried to use a variety of platforms and messaging systems so that&#8217;s why the curiosity.  No one really has a need to do this, so perhaps I was just overly curious because the BBM people do tend to float it as a reason for the platform.  Perhaps that is lack of experience elsewhere.  I&#8217;m not making that a loaded statement, just may as well be.</p>
<p>I think people use BBM as a mainstay of Blackberry in general is because it has been around for so long.  While other people were just texting Blackberries were doing way more with bbm.  There may be 3rd party apps for download that are equal to bbm but bbm was around before apps were a dime a dozen. I tend to agree that a lot of what attracts me to blackberrys is bbm. It has consistently trumped my experience with other built in messaging applications.</p>
<p>I cant believe BBM works better (your last comment) but I think the rest makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking non-3rd party stuff.  I only have experience using 3 phones/os&#8217;s.  Blackberry 5 curve, iphone 4s, and wp7 on htc titan.  I think the whole experience of bbm on blackberry was better.  But that takes into account each os&#8217;s notification system in the os and out of (bb LED light of godliness) how you navigate to the message and typing.  My overall texting experience was most pleasurable quick and easy on blackberry, then iphone and then my windows phone.  I don&#8217;t know what apple did to their virtual keyboard but it&#8217;s way better than my htc titan windows phone key board.</p>
<p>Good info.  As far as I know the Apple soft keyboard was continually predicting words in the background to estimate the next most likely key you would hit, and enlarging the touch sensitive area for the expected ones.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t remember where I read that, but it sounds smart.  the Keyboard in Android 4.0 was also massively improved, though I use SwiftKey 3 now.</p>
<p>Often when I type on my windows phone I hit the B instead of space so I get text like this&quot;<br />
Oftenbwhenbitypebonbmybwindowsbphone<br />
If it was smart too it wouldnt be a problem!</p>
<p>Oh yes.  I did that a LOT with SwiftKey until 3, now it is very intelligent about where to insert spaces =)</p>
<p>As TNell said you can integrate numerous different apps with it also.</p>
<p>For me BBM shines in one very specific way.  The check mark, delivered, read, notification.  Whenever I send a BBM I can tell when my message got to my friends phone and when they have read the message.  It is similar to Apple bbm knock-off except it lets you know when your friend read the message, not just that it was delivered.  This is very handy for when you are rapidly bbm-ing someone information, driving directions, meeting times etc.  You don&#8217;t need to type out a reply.  Your reply is sent just by you reading the message because it changes the D for delievered to an R for read.</p>
<p>Easy.  Knowing that someone has received my message and then that they read my message is an amazing feature for me. No more &#8220;hey did you get my text?&#8221; you know if they got it, you know if they read it and you know if they are ignoring you :P</p>
<p>Yeah &#8211; that is the one thing Beluga, Whatsapp and G+ Messenger lack for me.  There is delivery receipt on Facebook (Beluga) and WA, but not read.</p>
<p>Oddly because of how iOS notifications work a received mark for an iOS user literally means read as the notification does not retrieve the message, only opening it does.</p>
<p>The &#8220;read&#8221; notification for bbm occurs when the user either starts typing a response or presses back to leave the message.</p>
<p>no&#8230; The Read notification is sent as soon as the other user opens the message.</p>
<p>They are apps that will allow you to read the message in a seperate app so that they don&#8217;t see that you read it.</p>
<p>You can PING users that will vibrate their phone regardless of there current ringer profile.. So if their phone is set to silent, Pinging them makes the phone vibrate.   Very useful when you need draw attention to your message.</p>
<p>Group chat, sharing of pictures, contacts etc is probally in other apps, but on the bb, every popup screen allow you to send anything (email, pic, tweet, files) to a bbm contact or group.</p>
<p>My experience was with BBOS 5.x so perhaps that was changed, I recall many times being sneaky and reading the bbm but then pretty END to go back to the home screen to keep the yellow dot of &#8220;unread&#8221; present.</p>
<p>Ping certainly sounds useful</p>
<p>skype has delivery info (you knoww when it is not delivered&#8230;). read-receipt is good but I never the like the spam from those unless it is business-related.</p>
<p>For BBM it doesn&#8217;t send separate messages, it displays as a little thing next to the message as a check mark, a D for delivered and an R for read.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used all the major IMs on different platforms and the simple truth is that BBM is a superior offering. Whatsapp comes close but again, it can&#8217;t touch BBM. Even former owners of BlackBerries who used BBM will tell you this. It&#8217;s integration with the device is what makes it better to use. Now that video chat is coming, it will be a complete product and service</p>
<p>I still have and use a 9800 because I need a communicator,  not a media device with an impressive app store that will account for half my credit card. And I;m not alone in this regard. In my part of the world, you get stuck on your phone because you&#8217;re engaged in conversation, not because of a game or media (besides social media of course)</p>
<p>Interesting perspective, but I also only use Android for doing things, not games or video.  We all have preferences on how of course.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t see what is superior, although so far the conversation has raised a few points that I certainly see as useful.  Integration I suppose I would have to see properly in person to understand though.  It sounds similar to Android, but I am open to being totally wrong on that.</p>
<p>You know, interesting that I read this now. I&#8217;ve just come back to Blackberry (Bold 9900) for the same reason.  After 15 months with Android I came to realize that messaging and communication &#8211; not games and movies &#8211; were what I spent most of my time doing and what was more important to me.  And it&#8217;s sad to see so much anti-Blackberry stuff out there because in a sense it has remained a smartphone while the so called new genre of smartphones have become bloated battery-hogging entertainment devices.  BBM was one of the best things about Blackberry before I departed and if it was cross-platform I would aim to use it as my primary messaging device.</p>
<p>I applaud you for being objective in a world where the subjective opinion of a single nation determines the apparent &#8220;best&#8221; solution for any and every problem</p>
<p>What an impressive feature to get in 2012, please tell me more RIM on how you&#8217;re going to revolutionize the mobile industry again.</p>
<p>Oh I&#8217;m sorry 2013*</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re being a bit optimistic&#8230; How about early 2013. I just can&#8217;t wait to throw my iPhone in the toilet for the cutting edge Blackberry!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9TYaN.jpg" /></p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not cross platform, like the crap they have on the playbook, then it will be all but useless.</p>
<p>I agree. At this point they need to make BBM cross-platform. It&#8217;s too late to keep it only for the BB OS as an &#8220;advantage&#8221;. They will just die with it if they do that. They need to get people into using BBM again, no matter what OS they are using now, and then hope that they will get want to get back to BB phones in the future.</p>
<p>wow just think of all that data usage!! no really, think about it.  BBM video chat while roaming. I can see your bill now&#8230;.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry folks, this will never see the light of day. RIM will be broken up and sold to the highest bidders well before then.</p>
<p>Each handset will also come bundled with imperial white elephant in a purple and gold plumage to help sales.</p>
<p>TimeFace&#8230;&#8230; Hehe, really can&#8217;t get what people see. Will take Htc phone over bb but using iPhone thou :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing a much much more boring name like BBM Video Call or something mundane and cumbersome.</p>
<p>I would love to use BB phone for the physical keyboard. The only thing keeps me from that is the lack of the navigation app I want which is available on all other platforms in my country.</p>
<p>If RIM moved at the speed of android OEMs such as Samsung we would&#8217;ve had BB 10 already. Speaking of Samsung, I hope to see some collaboration between the two&#8230;..</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t you use BlackBerry Traffic or Wayze?</p>
<p>What next? <strong>Blackberry 10 confirmed to be able to &#8220;send SMS messages&#8221; &#8211; receipt of messages as yet unknown</strong></p>
<p>Did you read any comments above?</p>
<p>Dude I was making fun of RIM. Because I hate them so much.</p>
<p>I wonder if BBM could video chat will service provider charge more for BlackBerry plans as now more data would be sent over BBM ?</p>
<p>Well, somebody got to do it. :D<br />
<img src="http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/4194/rimfaith.png" /></p>
<p>It might not be useful for those other platforms but those already using it (with contacts) this is a great upcoming feature  built in. No need to worry about quota  under a BIS /BES plan and I&#8217;m assuming isn&#8217;t just limited to WIFI since BBM runs on blackberry service. After all the iPhone only recently fixed its facetime product.  Video chat is  old hat but Whatsapp and other similar products may come close but dont offer integration as seamless as BBM!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why blackberry is dissed so much by other users who have no  interest in Blackberries. you know competition is good.</p>
<p>There will be Skype integration with the Video Chat similar to how LinkedIn and Twitter are integrated into the PIM apps in the Playbook OS.</p>
<p>Considering BBM has 56million users worldwide that have more activity than all of other IM programs globally on a daily basis, you can see why they are leveraging BBM so much. Considering WhatsApp only added the ability to add profile pics today and still trying to catch up with some other features of BBM, it is still the best IM cilent out there.</p>
<p>Skype? Microsoft is nice enough to allow their first party service on bb10?</p>
<p>Why not? Believe, MS had learned from its mistakes or made to learn. I like the way MS is going towards. All services in all platforms should be their goal.</p>
<p>But their Android apps are crap. Except smartglass. I use that sparingly, but it&rsquo;s not fully utitlized just yet.</p>
<p>They are just starting. They&rsquo;re not anywhere close to what I wish. Wish them for at least trying.</p>
<p>Did you use skydrive? Its very good.</p>
<p>SkyDrive is real good</p>
<p>Android app is crap cos Android is crap</p>
<p>my my, who hurt your butt, little boy?</p>
<p>You are entitled to <em>your</em> opinion, but 1.3M people per day beg to differ&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, Microsoft isn&rsquo;t Google&hellip;</p>
<p>Ha good one</p>
<p>Or Apple.</p>
<p>There is a common mistake make by techies and journalists which is that people &ndash; normal people, who never read The Verge more than 10 minute a month &ndash; choose their devices based on apps. Simply not true for most of the people.</p>
<p>They get a device for a lot of trivial or simple reasons (brand, look and feel, price, contract, ads, friends, &hellip;), and then get the apps they can get. No Skype? Then they will choose another video app, not buy a Windows Phone.</p>
<p>The same for almost all apps, games, mail, cloud storage, office, maps, &hellip;</p>
<p>Wonder how many are terrible Android ports only made to get a free Playbook.</p>
<p>Over 70,000 apparently.</p>
<p>According to Josh, BB said that only 1,000 were native apps.</p>
<p>I was definitely one of them. I just about managed to make an app which converted one unit into another, in the shoddiest and ugliest way possible. Sold the PlayBook. 180 quid for a few hours work :)</p>
<p>What a douche move</p>
<p>Entreprenurial move really:)</p>
<p>(Bastard, wish I had done it)</p>
<p>I was going to release an app that solves algebra problems and shows all of the work it took to get it solved. I stopped because I thought it was useless or not useful enough. Maybe I should reconsider, I&rsquo;d love to be able to play with a playbook. It&rsquo;s probably too late now.</p>
<p>Hah, mine was just a reference app I made for an FFXI expansion.  Fun fact: it was made in App Maker.</p>
<p>Sold mine for $200.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s funny is that I saw a &ldquo;What&rsquo;s App&rdquo; icon on the screen of the demo unit&hellip; knowing that they said they would not developp a version for BB10. Did they change their mind or is it an android version running ?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; it seems that Blackberry managed to convince them after all :).</p>
<p>There was a version for the legacy BB6 OS that I used on my Bold 9000 a couple of years back.</p>
<p>Maybe not.  There have been numerous reports of people pirating Android apps and converting them to BB10 apps so they could get the benefits that RIM was shouting from the rooftops about.  Not all of those 70,000 apps may be legit.  Many may never benefit the actual creators because of that.</p>
<p>Thats not a bad start.. it definitely needs apps for it to be a compelling platform.</p>
<p>No, it needs <strong>popular</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> apps to compete.</p>
<p>They just mentioned popular and quality apps in the article.  Having popular and quality apps aren&rsquo;t enough however.  They need lots of apps.<br />
Windows Phone&rsquo;s store extremely vacant.  They have the popular and quality apps in there however that is it.</p>
<p>Having 70,000 apps guarantees that the vast majority of the apps are probably utter garbage. Eventually the numbers get to be so big that people stop comparing quality and just start bashing others over the head with quantity.</p>
<p>Have you used BB10? How do you know what the apps are like?</p>
<p>Well, guaranteeing everyone who got their App in the Marketplace until a certain date to get $100 gives you lots of crappy Apps, because for Quality Apps that is to Little of an incentive.</p>
<p>So what about Netflix?</p>
<p>RIM&rsquo;s been trying to get Skype and Netflix on the Playbook more than any other app apparently. Skype finally bit, Netflix didn&rsquo;t I guess.</p>
<p>No netflix?</p>
<p>I need Path to be in there.</p>
<p>I would like that more people I know would start using Path.. :(</p>
<p>70,000 *stolen apps</p>
<p>I have a solid bet that the horrid battery might be in relation to running multiple android apps live at the same time. Java runtimes running without pause seems like a GREAT way to kill the battery.</p>
<p>Stolen? Slander&rsquo;s a pretty big step to take. Got any evidence behind your claims?</p>
<p>There was a mild scandal a few weeks ago when someone saw some android app appear on bbworld. The android app developer had no clue what&rsquo;s going on. It turned out that some asshole had gotten the apk (since that&rsquo;s all you need, yay for bb), and uploaded it to bbworld. Then it turned out that a lot more apps were actually stolen.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m calling you a liar</p>
<p>twenty seconds of google searching came up with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/166lgt/developers_check_the_blackberry_store_for_pirated/">this</a> corroborating link where several Android app developers are discussing how their apps have been pirated and uploaded to bbworld without their knowledge.</p>
<p>Before calling someone a liar you should do basic research.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re really gonna need a link there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/166lgt/developers_check_the_blackberry_store_for_pirated/">Here</a> is a link to a discussion where several different developers have reported that exact thing happening.  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/25/is-your-android-app-on-blackberry-app-world-without-you-knowing/">Here</a> is a news link discussing it if you don&rsquo;t like reading comment threads on the topic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I was wondering.</p>
<p>Running Android executables on their Java runtime &ndash; does that count as BB10 app?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Windows Phone land&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/ALdamfL.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>&hellip;.What?</p>
<p>Skulls Of The Shogun just came out yesterday. New Nokia devices unveiled at MWC. New WP update potentially unveiled at MWC. RIM set their price point to high 199$ Nokia phones are better and cost a lot less.</p>
<p>&hellip; meanwhile what?  I&rsquo;m looking at this list and wondering WTF is so &ldquo;impressive&rdquo; about a bunch of apps already available on WP8, iOS or Android.</p>
<p>I guess we&rsquo;ll see if verge&rsquo;s review gives BB10 a <strong>5</strong> for ecosystem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all kind of a big circle though, isn&rsquo;t it? People want a phone with a lot of high quality apps, developers want to create apps on popular platforms. From what has been seen and written about BB10 by the media, people are definitely going to be interested in these new phones. And once those sales get high enough, developers will be looking to cash in.</p>
<p>This cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>I could couldn&rsquo;t care less about games. Where are the productivity apps? Utilities?</p>
<p>Would need Spotify to make the switch. Oh, and GroupMe would be nice too. I kind of want to give this OS a try.</p>
<p>When are they ever going to learn?</p>
<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gjhwHZlWaPA/T5H7GB_y8UI/AAAAAAAABak/Z1UJyBFY_sk/s1600/funny-pictures-cat-is-amazed.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>THERE IS NO PROBLEM</strong><br />
<img src="http://www.welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/images/07-minister.jpg" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;re glad to hear of any bright spot for RIM, and the company has indeed just passed three billion downloads in its store&#8230;  according to the numbers given to the press by RIM executives.</p>
<p>I though like you, until I actually recevied device with BB10 beta. Actually, BB 10 is suprinsingly good on basics. BB 10 alpha device is faster than Galaxy S3! And it&#8217;s only two cores, but the system is so much faster. Webbrowser loads full Verge site in mere 2 seconds and then scrolling is absolutly smooth and instant, to the point that Android devices (event with 4.1 butter) has sadly not come yet. And it renders 1280&#215;720. Plaing flash fullhd wideo and scrolling webpage when video is playing is also very smooth, which is impressive.</p>
<p>So, i really hope that BB can make it and retain it&#8217;s position. For me BB10 is looking better than WP8 already.</p>
<p>can see that tagline winning over people months from now: &#8220;Amazing BB10! Doesn&#8217;t suck &#8211; scroll the web a little better than mid 2012 android devices! And more!&#8221;</p>
<p>your comment clearly shows that you have never even used a blackberry.  Web browsing on even current devices like the 9900 is very very good, at par, if not better than the galaxy nexus (that&#8217;s the only android device I have to compare to).   So please, even though its cool right now to beat up on blackberry, don&#8217;t speak to which you know nothing about.</p>
<p>There is still a possibility that they&#8217;ll pull this out and not die (Apple ended up surviving) but what does BB10 offer that would compel people to buy it over anything else that is available?</p>
<p>Page load speeds, scrolling, etc. are all things that could be dealt with on any other platform with a software update. Heck, even BB Messenger has been replicated (in essence) on iOS (and I&#8217;m sure there are comparable options on Android too).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see BB survive because I&#8217;ve always liked the look of the hardware and the build quality. In fact, the only intolerable thing about them was the OS itself (and the fact that their network went down once a month, on average, while I used their devices) but why should I leave iOS (which I am very, VERY happy with) to try something out that is at version 1.0 when iOS is already at 6.0?  This is BB10&#8217;s real problem.</p>
<blockquote>&#8230; but what does BB10 offer that would compel people to buy it over anything else that is available?</blockquote>
<p>At this point, RIM needs to keep their remaining customer base, and get as much of it as possible to upgrade to BB10.  That will greatly help with the public&#8217;s mindshare of what a &#8220;Blackberry&#8221; is these days.  A great BB10 device is no good when most people still think a Blackberry is a non-touch device from the 90s.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t help that there is no upgrade path to BB-10 short of buying a new phone.</p>
<p>Lol I own a 9900 and love it to death for what it is but let&#8217;s not kid ourselves. While the browser is way better than the one on OS6 it is still nowhere near my nexus.</p>
<p>Hell, not even the browser on my playbook is as fast and smooth as mobile chrome.</p>
<p>I love blackberry and really want it to succeed but they&#8217;ve got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p>My Playbook browser shits on any other mobile browser, Chrome, Android native, and Firefox. Dolphin performs best on Android and Mobile Safari is lacking.</p>
<p>I tend to &#8220;Open Link on Playbook&#8221; most of the time when not at a desktop</p>
<p>The problem is that it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s not like the other browsers are completely atrocious and driving people away from their respective platforms, they work great and. What are some specifics that make your Playbook&#8217;s browser shit on everyone else?</p>
<p>I hope BB10 does well to, but you haven&#8217;t even see WP8.</p>
<p>I did &#8211; i saw UI design (which hasn&#8217;t change much anyway) and i simply don&#8217;t like it. But it&#8217;s my opionion.</p>
<p>The UI design&#8230;&#8230;and you haven&#8217;t even seen everything of that yet only the homescreen &lt;&#8212;&#8212;. No consumer facing features shown as yet either. Just wait and see.</p>
<p>There was a whole demo of WP8. It&#8217;s still Metro.</p>
<p>No, it was at a developer summit where they showed announced things that matter to devs: multi core, NFC, VoIP integration, screen resolution. How do you show off stuff without going to the start screen? It was NOT the whole demo of WP8. It is metro, I doubt that will go for a while.</p>
<p>seeing your account only has 7 comments and only on BB post you are obviously a plant</p>
<p>I&#8217;m obviously not. I&#8217;m mostly an iOS/Android developer (and prefer those systems than Playbook), but when received BB10 alpha device, it suprised me how fast it is. And this is the only reason i felt need to defend BB just a little &#8211; to let them show real deal before claiming that they will die.<br />
Might publish a video of aplha device, but it won&#8217;t show exactly how responsive it is &#8211; you need to feel it by yourself.</p>
<p>And not engaging into iOS-Android wars on Verge comments does not mean, that i&#8217;m not into those platforms ;) But I don&#8217;t feel there is any point in commenting on those.</p>
<p>I think anything is smoother than Android. A legitimate comparison would be against the iPhone, the undisputed king of creamy smoothness.</p>
<p>Seriously? Even jelly bean? I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve given android a chance.</p>
<p>You obviously haven&#8217;t used anything <strong>but</strong> Android if you think JB is as smooth as iOS or WP7.</p>
<p>iPhone king of smoothness? Maybe &#8211; but Windows Phone would beg to differ.</p>
<p>Agreed. And on 2010 hardware too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the PlayBook, that only received so much hate because it a) Had a childish name (Google Play is no better) and b) No email client. However, no matter how good BB10, unless the hardware is genuinely different, the problem is that Google (and Apple) have such a huge ecosystem. Google with their maps, search, G+ etc etc. However, where RIM may stand a chance is in the corporate world, where they originally succeeded, but to do that, they MUST get closer to Microsoft, It is only young people using BBM that has kept them alive in the last few years. Most youth I know who have BlackBerry&#8217;s are upgrading to iPhones, where they use Facebook messenger to girly gossip and become metrosexuals, if they are male of the species.</p>
<p>No one cares about the &#8220;ecosystem&#8221;.  Stop mindlessly repeating the same tripe you hear on the web.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s run with your assertion that BB10 is a phenomenal OS.</p>
<p>I guess now the only hurdles RIM has are:<br />
1) Convincing consumers they&#8217;re relevant again<br />
2) Convincing carriers they&#8217;re relevant again<br />
3) Convincing salespeople they&#8217;re relevant again<br />
4) Releasing hardware that is exciting</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen this song and dance before:  great software (WebOS, WP) that doesn&#8217;t sell, hindered by other, external forces.</p>
<p>And that is of course assuming the whole &#8220;great software from RIM&#8221; assertion is true.  It is certainly an uphill climb for RIM.  Funny how they laughed at iPhone in 2007, mocked iPad in 2010 and then gave us the Playbook whose tagline shoud have been &#8220;welcome to amateur hour.&#8221;  Everything RIM mocked or derided in the past 5 years has been what they have sorely been trying and failing to imitate in the last two years.</p>
<p>I think you are forgetting that the average consumer is not a tech focused mobile OS obsessed person like the people here who read track follow post and lurk on various forums and different OS news sites.  When most people see my windows phone they think it&#8217;s an android and when I correct them they say they&#8217;ve never heard of it.  Everyone knows what blackberries are so RIM doesn&#8217;t have that problem.  I still see a lot of people with blackberries so when blackberry releases a new fancy phone with a new OS I don&#8217;t think it will be too difficult for people to understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Carriers would obviously want more options because that means they will be tapping a larger audience which equals more money.  WebOS had it hard for many reasons, but carriers already know RIM and their popularity even if it is currently waning.</p>
<p>Salespeople will be the biggest challenge but they are the most biased and will try to push what they think is best and perhaps not simply listen and offer options to consumers.  I&#8217;ve had many salespeople shove android down my throat and balk when I requested to see a windows phone.</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s hardware has always been solid and sturdy.  When I did own a blackberry I dropped it countless times and sure it got scuffed but it never broke which I appreciated because I am a uncoordinated.</p>
<p>Yes I am rooting for RIM to make something compelling simply beacuse I have had a good experience with them in the past and I favor more competition over Android/Apple duopoly.  That benefits no one and will stall innovation and progress and make it harder for new ideas and concepts to penetrate the market.</p>
<p>Consumers are less likely to forgive a company for their past shortfalls. Lots of customers who come to my job (I work for a large carrier) tell me they hate their BBs and can&#8217;t wait until their upgrade.</p>
<p>The UI is a mess and unintuitive. Look at the settings, do regular people really want to screw around with all that crap? No. No they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I think they should drop the blackberry name and move onto something new to cut ties with their past fuckups. Same with MS, they should call their OS Metro or MetroOS instead of Windows Phone.</p>
<p>My old blackberry did take more than 10 seconds to learn but now has cursed me with frustration.  My WP7 has like zero setting customization.  With bb I could set each alert, ring, alarm, vibration frequency, length of vibration for everything, which is magical.  Once you get it set up it&#8217;s great.  My wp7 has 2 notification sounds and 2 vibrates (aside from calls) and that is it.  With blackberry I can know that this vibrate means a fb notification that vibrate means an email that vibrate means a text or bbm.  It lets you know things that are important and not important because you customized it.  Which means I can check my phone a lot less.</p>
<p>I agree their legacy UI is more like a computer than a mobile OS.  Which is why I hold out hope for BB10.  I like a lot of the features and thought that went into blackberries but their current OS is just plain old.  A new fresh OS plus all the nice customization and touches that blackberry is good at makes me have high hopes for BB10.</p>
<blockquote>he numbers in the report do not gel with what we’re seeing in the real world</blockquote>
<p>"There is no spoon, Neo"</p>
<p>I guess they&#8217;ve fired all the analysts at RIM.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackberry 10 Jam.&#8221; Damn, they really are doomed.</p>
<p>To be honest, I want BlackBerry to succeed. I want more variety than just iOS and Android&#8230;</p>
<p>Windows Phone?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/07/13/how-many-lumia/">How many Lumia phones were sold in the US?</a></p>
<p>So that means Windows Phone isn&#8217;t a viable option? I don&#8217;t think you realize how much money Microsoft is pouring into WP; they are going full steam ahead. Marginalizing the potential of Windows Phone is just ignorant.</p>
<p>Yup, how much money did they pour in, and how much results came out of that? I&#8217;d say WP8 has a decent chance, but MS is going to have a hard time convincing consumers after abandoning two mobile OSes in a row.</p>
<p>They rightfully abandoned them.  They weren&#8217;t good enough so they made something else.  That&#8217;s what a company is supposed to do when their product doesn&#8217;t meet requirements.</p>
<p>No, a company is supposed to make sure the product meets requirements <em>before</em> releasing the product.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#8217;t have had enough time.</p>
<p>WP8 has been in development since WP7, however WP7 was always meant to be an interim platform.</p>
<p>If MS had waited, they would&#8217;ve stood absolutely no chance now. Plus, it is all part of the big reveal.</p>
<p>Consumers don&#8217;t care about excuses.</p>
<p>They don`t care about WP8 unavailability either.<br />
Only basement dwellers do.</p>
<p>Why stop there?  They don&#8217;t care about Windows Phone at all, only basement dwellers do.</p>
<p>I believe that.</p>
<p>You basement dwellers always get right into absurd territory precisely because you don`t know where to stop.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t care about WP, and thus am not a basement dweller.</p>
<p>Well, given the way  the few people willing to give MS the benefit of the doubt have been thoroughly, callously and premeditately ass-fucked, I&#8217;d be surprised if there are enough faithful waiting for &#8220;the big reveal&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the risk of veering off topic, would an accidental ass-fucking be better than a pre-meditated one?  I mean if it&#8217;s pre-meditated they might at least use lube.</p>
<p>You guys are dirty and not to mention idiots. They had to kill WP7 and those of us who use WP7 and see the legitimate benefits will stick through this and adopt WP8 which is looking mighty delicious already. MSFT knows that they haven&#8217;t put on a full marketing scheme for WP as yet (hence WP still has kind of low visibility) so not very man people are affected or soured by it but at least they have a presence (Rather than sitting out until WP8 was finished).</p>
<p>Nobody is arguing about this being or being not the most beneficial course of action for MS. We&#8217;re just drawing attention to MS stabbing those people who had faith in it in the back.</p>
<p>Android. Pot.Kettle.Black</p>
<p>&#8230; is that an object oriented joke?</p>
<p>There are no verbs, which I guess would mean it&#8217;s declarative.</p>
<p>Android = Pot.call(Kettle, Color.BLACK)</p>
<p>Fixed.</p>
<p>A significant portion of that money is coming from android sales too, so their losses may not be as high as you imagine.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Windows Phone is a viable option RIGHT NOW. Maybe once 8 drops, things will change though. Either way, I&#8217;m with you that there is major potential in WP in the long run. I really believe Microsoft has no choice but to go all in with WP over the next few years to try and gain some traction in mobile. They could very well be the great innovators that we need to push things to the next level.</p>
<p>Well BB 10 isn&#8217;t a viable option <strong>right now</strong> either, and as far sat the future is concerned , who has the greater chance &#8212; BB with it&#8217;s rapidly collapsing customer base as RIM burns through its remaining cash, or WP with Microsoft continuing to pour cash into it for the foreseeable future?</p>
<p>The alternative for Microsoft is abandoning the mobile space to Google and Apple &#8212; how likely is that?  On the other hand RIM either going bankrupt of being sold off in pieces is pretty much inevitable.</p>
<p>Yo idiot. RIMs customer base is NOT collapsing, its slightly growing globally, NOR are they burning cash. They&#8217;ve no dept and still 2,2 Billion cash, even generating more of it.</p>
<p>Unbelievable that no one on here can&#8217;t tell differences between the upcoming BB10 and Android or iOS. Shame on you all. The difference is the user paradigm and the interface. BB10 will set make the smartphone a communications device again. You can still watch movies, surf the web and play games with it, even THAT you will can do better on BB10 than on the others, but communications, organizing and ease-of-use, even one-handed, will differentiate BB10 massively from all others. IOS and Android will keep being kids phones. BB10 will be a tool that even fullfills these kiddy-disciplines from the others better &#8211; just as a little +. CIAO.</p>
<p>Is it a viable option right now? No. If a friend or family member came to you and asked what phone they should buy <em>right now</em>, could you look them straight in the eyes and recommend Windows Phone 7?</p>
<p>Throwing money at a problem doesnt always fix it. They spent $500,000,000 to buy Danger, and then killed the Kin after 6 weeks. MS, Nokia, and ATT spent another $500,000,000 in advertising for the Lumia 900, and Nokia managed to grab a <em>staggering</em> 0.3% of the US smartphone market. Extrapolating from the numbers in that link, that would equate to <strong>76,000</strong> phones in 4 months.</p>
<p>Windows Phone is tied to Windows 8. If consumers embrace Windows 8, then Microsoft will have their own halo effect as Apple did with the iPod. If consumers reject the major changes on the desktop and refuse to give the Surface a try, then Windows Phone is in for a very, very ugly ride.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s not like WP 7/7.5 is a feature-phone OS. Second, I own a Lumia 900 (along with a Galaxy Nexus and iPhone 4s)and absolutely love it.   Furthermore, are you really going to compare the Kin to WP? Everyone knows the Kin was a joke; I&#8217;m not denying that. Lastly, I was referring to the <em>potential</em> of WP.</p>
<p>I agree with every word &#8212; but no matter how ugly the ride gets, Microsoft will just keep on trying &#8212; they have no choice but to &#8212; in the long run (already, really) all future growth is mobile. Losing out in this market is an existential threat to Microsoft.</p>
<p>RIM on the other hand will simply run out of cash. Most likely in a matter of months.</p>
<p>You are so clueless bro. How are they gonna run out of money. 5000 layoffs will save them so much cash that they will have more money when BB10 releases then they have now.</p>
<p>Because nobody in their right mind will purchase a current generation BlackBerry because 1) they&#8217;re garbage compared to other offerings and 2) BlackBerry10 is on its way with no available upgrade path for current devices.</p>
<p>This is from the link:<br />
<blockquote>If we then use comScore’s figure for total smartphone users (110 million) then the data would suggest that there are <strong>330k Lumias in use</strong> in the US.</blockquote><br />
What are you smoking?</p>
<p>He also saying that MS, Nokia and AT&amp;T spent 500 million on ad for the lumia, it&#8217;s really pulled out of nowhere, there an verge article that says that AT&amp;T don&#8217;t even spend 100 Million for ad, and how large the chance MS and Nokia spend 400 m on ads alone?</p>
<p>Yes I would. After using a lumia for a length of time, I&#8217;d definitely recommend it over every single android phone I&#8217;ve used to boot or which I have been lended over the time.</p>
<p>Plus most people I&#8217;d be recommending a phone to, would be first time smartphone buyers and the native offerings of the nokias are just better than the native offerings of most other devs and platforms.</p>
<p>Sure both android and ios do have a bunch of amazing apps, but that&#8217;s not so important to first timeers.</p>
<p>On top of that, I&#8217;ve seen people get lost in adroid time and time again. I&#8217;ve seen them get pissed at the showelware they can&#8217;t uninstall and a huge deal of other things. (and no rooting is not an option for most users, even less so when you consider the fact that rooting often voids your warranty)</p>
<p>Then you&#8217;re a bad person. Seriously. Choosing to recommend something that you know has a limited application selection and won&#8217;t see an upgrade after 7.8 is appalling. You&#8217;d be tying a friend or family member to a phone for 2 years just because you&#8217;re a huge fanboy. There&#8217;s no other justification for doing that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be the first to admit that I&#8217;m an Android fan. Most people I know know this. But I&#8217;d recommend an iPhone over a phone I know won&#8217;t get upgraded in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>If someone I know asked for a recommendation, it&#8217;d be a Nexus or an iPhone. Shame on you for saying you&#8217;d tie someone to a piece of junk for two years. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s their first smartphone or not, they should still get what&#8217;s best.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>You sound upset. Tell us how you really feel.</p>
<p>A bad person for recommending a working and viable handset which, despite your sanctimonious preaching, will not cease to work when  Windows Phone 8 is released? My goodness, I thought we reserved such labels to people who do truly horrific things. You know, like kill other people and punch kittens.</p>
<p>Here is a little hint, those people you are likely to be recommending to, don&#8217;t give a monkey&#8217;s behind about what version of firmware or software their phones are running. They don&#8217;t really care about being able to smoothly play the latest game released for that platform.</p>
<p>For those people, a Lumia 900 would certainly be able to see them through two years.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re a stupid person. Seriously. Choosing to use something that you know has the buggiest apps around and that will probably never see a Jelly Bean update, just because you &lt;3 Google, is just pathetic.</p>
<p>I use a Galaxy Nexus and it gets plenty of updates, thank you very much. I clearly said I&#8217;d recommend an iPhone or a Nexus device.</p>
<p>Buggy? Every phone price of software crashes and I am especially supriseed to hear it from someone that uses microsoft?! Khalid is right why would you offer your friend a crap phone? Give him an sg3 or IPhone&#8230;.jeez anything other than a phone that is that bad</p>
<p>No &#8211; I&#8217;d be recommending them a phone that I know will be perfect for their needs. Generally speaking the only disparity between most platforms is once it comes to heavy power users.</p>
<p>Where android rules in a certain regard. But normal people? Even more so first time smartphone buyers? Those people usually suffer under android. I&#8217;ve got people who pine for feature phones because they were smooth, fast and fullfilled their needs. But at the same time they don&#8217;t want to go back, because they&#8217;ve come to enjoy the video player, the browser, the social network and navigation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking in my experience that is what most people want from a phone.</p>
<p>Also piece of junk? Wp7 surpasses android in a number of areas currently. And the majority of current ICS phone will at best get an upgrade to JB &#8211; which is more akin to the old NODO upgrade on wp. The upgrades there are even more broken.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re obviously someone who considers android, even in it&#8217;s flawed state to be a clearly superior OS. I won&#8217;t argue it isn&#8217;t a strong and powerful OS that&#8217;s very feature filled. But at the same time android is a huge mess.</p>
<p>The majority of people I&#8217;d be recommending a device to, don&#8217;t have a clue what the hell their phone (or in a lot of cases their computer) is running on. They know it&#8217;s a nokia, they know it&#8217;s a samsung. Apps are a bonus and baked in features are what they care about.</p>
<p>Software version? They don&#8217;t care about it.</p>
<p>Absolutely agree. Most people&#8217;s usage involves texting, calling and email. All OS&#8217; do this but the OS&#8217; that are best for the tech-unsavvy are iOS and WP. Period.</p>
<p>Hell, I&#8217;m using a One X right now and I love it but android is not ideal for someone who just wants to use their phone and not have to figure it out.</p>
<p>Most Android phones won&#8217;t get a meaningful upgrade.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of pent up frustration with Android.  Definitely not a good thing for Google.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re spouting a lot of garbage, most of which is flat out wrong.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really want to stick around for WP8 because of my experience with WP7, especially now that there is no ugprade path.</p>
<p>The same could be said for Blackberries except that from what it looks like BB10 is leaps and bounds and heads and shoulders greater and more up to date that BBOS 7&#8230;  The difference between WP7 and 8 doesnt seem that great.</p>
<p>Have you seen WP8?</p>
<p>I have seen what previews I can and what information there is out there.  They got rid of the pointless metro gutter and I&#8217;m sure there a lot of improvements but the difference between the two appears to be not as incremental.  All I&#8217;m sayin.</p>
<p>First of all, those numbers are wrong. Secondly, you might want to do a bit of research. Windows Phone has already surpassed Blackberry in numerous countries.</p>
<p><a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/full-kantar-numbers-confirm-windows-phone-outselling-blackberry-in-us-germany-australia/" target="_blank">http://wmpoweruser.com/full-kantar-numbers-confirm-windows-phone-outselling-blackberry-in-us-germany-australia/</a></p>
<p>There ecosystem has long since surpassed Blackberry.</p>
<p><a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/distimo-report-finds-the-wp7-marketplace-has-passed-blackberry-app-world/" target="_blank">http://wmpoweruser.com/distimo-report-finds-the-wp7-marketplace-has-passed-blackberry-app-world/</a></p>
<p>So laugh all you want, but RIM is about as dead as you can be. They&#8217;ll be lucky if Microsoft doesn&#8217;t pick their bones clean. Not to mention that Windows Phone 8 will be on the market for a full 4 to 5 months before BB10 sees the light of day. RIM doesn&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Interesting numbers &#8211; seems like Windows Mobile is still a respectable fraction of Microsoft&#8217;s sales even in 2012Q1 &#8211; something a lot of Microsoft fans deny vehemently.</p>
<p>Actually, Nielsen has issued a statement debunking the combining or multiplying of the two data sets. This is not to say that Lumias have sold more or less, simply to say that Nielsen doesn&#8217;t agree with the conclusion drawn by that particular author and others.</p>
<p>Well yes, but I know i&#8217;m not going to use it&#8230; (I&#8217;m using Windows on my PC and I don&#8217;t want to have same stuff on my smartphone and computer&#8230;)</p>
<p>There is always windows phone that has a better chance of making it then blackberry does</p>
<p>If Rim was asking its developers on whether they still are interested in developing for BB10.  What do you think the developer&#8217;s answer will be, chance are it will be yes regardless of the actual truth.  Competent businessmen don&#8217;t just burn bridges for no reason.</p>
<p>I made a vendor account on the App World, and they won&#8217;t let me delete it. There&#8217;s no possible way for their vendor base to shrink. I bet their <em>active</em> vendor base is shrinking enormously, however. I seriously doubt their statistics accurately represent reality.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder, if they grew by 15000 apps, how many did they shrink by? I removed mine, and I wouldn&#8217;t put it past them to be including it anyway in that statistic.</p>
<p>I created a developer&#8217;s account, ported a free open source app, got a free Playbook, and sold it for Nexus 7 money. developers != developers, RIM, especially when free stuff is on the line.</p>
<p>This is the first thing that occurred to me reading his story. Really RIM, your developer base increased right around the time you started giving away free hardware? You don&#8217;t say!!</p>
<p>Well done, you must be very proud of yourself.</p>
<p>If somebody exhibits generosity, you should always abuse it.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t generosity &#8211; it was bribery, and thus absolutely fair game.</p>
<p>RIM says &#8220;develop for us and we&#8217;ll give you free kit!&#8221;<br />
You do a half-hearted port to get the free kit.<br />
You sell the free kit and buy a Nexus so you can develop for Google, who never gave you anything and couldn&#8217;t care less about you and is therefore much more deserving of your loyalty.</p>
<p>Yeah. Be nice and you&#8217;re considered desperate and uncool. Make sure people know you have no fucks to give and you&#8217;re considered awesome and en-vogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Be nice and you’re considered desperate and uncool. Make sure people know you have no fucks to give and you’re considered awesome and en-vogue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More like &#8211; if you have a successful platform you don&#8217;t need to bribe people to develop for it.</p>
<p>You keep using that word.</p>
<p>Do you also consider it a bribe when you buy a chick a drink in a bar?</p>
<p>If so, do you think its all cool when she takes your drink and, while you&#8217;re still talking to her, turns around, takes the drink you bought her, and sits somewhere else to hit on some other guy who is more successful with women?</p>
<p>Yes &#8211; that&#8217;s a bribe too &#8211; because you want something in return.</p>
<p>OK then I get your point in exchange for you getting a dictionary and learning the difference between a bribe, an incentive, and pandering.</p>
<p>Feel free to look up bribe in any dictionary you like &#8211; for instance here is Mirriam Webster (emphasis mine)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1: money or favor given or promised in order to influence the judgment or conduct of a person in a position of trust <br />
<strong>2: something that serves to induce or influence </strong><br />
Examples of BRIBE<br />
I offered the children a bribe for finishing their homework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can call it an incentive if that sounds nicer, but what it wasn&#8217;t was a gift.  It also wasn&#8217;t pandering, that would require RIM to be offering developers something that they really wanted.</p>
<p>No, it really was no gift, it was an incentive. But yeah, you obviously don&#8217;t like RIM, so I&#8217;ll let your dictionary quote stand.</p>
<p>Not that anybody else uses bribery in that way, but hey, I started with the dictionary bit, didn&#8217;t I.</p>
<p>But my boss bribed me to go to work so I&#8217;ll be off bribing customers with my service &#8211; thanks Merriam Webster!</p>
<p>It seems more like incentive than bribery.</p>
<p>There should really be a negative rating system on The Verge.</p>
<p>I got one too, but I made the mistake of opening the box. Now no one would buy it for more than $100.</p>
<p>Really? I used mine for a month and sold it for $160!</p>
<p>What developers are they talking to?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re imaginary ones that live in their closet.</p>
<p>RIM executives either live in some parallel universe or they are taking advantage of the free drugs from the Canadian health care system.</p>
<p>Everyone is handed out denial-pills when you step on RIM&#8217;s campus.</p>
<p>At this point I pretty much hope they fail just for the sheer arrogance they keep showing.</p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>
<p>I think you are the one who is pathetic, if you can&#8217;t see the arrogance in your own words</p>
<p>How did anything he say have any connotations of arrogance?</p>
<p>You have to be arrogant or at least some kind of sick twisted person to hope they fail just for a perceived arrogance you think someone else shows. A survey comes out saying X, they come out saying X is wrong , our Y is right.  I see no arrogance there just a need to correct a flawed opinion. Every company does it. You have to be arrogant and self entitled to feel personally slighted enough to hope they fail for this simple fact. Note that I dont try to opine whose opinion or survey or statistic is right or wrong here.</p>
<p>disagree, RIM is asking for your money, while selling you lies about the state of their business. this leading on could make your investment in them worthless.</p>
<p>thus they deserve jeers. if RIM becomes a charity then by all means lets give them some slack.</p>
<p>I would say that this is what Nokia didn&#8217;t want to happen with them, thus cutting the cord with their home grown stuff.  Can there really be more than two mobile operating systems to choose from?</p>
<p>The difference is that Nokia actually shipped their new platform &#8211; which RIM has yet to manage.</p>
<blockquote>Instead, he says, the BlackBerry App World vendor base has grown 157 percent in the past year, and even the PlayBook app catalog has &#8220;grown by more than 15,000 apps since January 1st of this year.&#8221;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
Probably because people like me signed up for the free PlayBook, which consequently I sold.</blockquote>
<p>Day after day, another bad news for RIM. When will the suffering ends ?</p>
<p>We all know RIM is in trouble right now, there is no denying that. And yes, their numbers likely are off even here but look around you before start talking. The BlackBerry 10 Jam Tours they&#8217;re holding are attracting developers, they&#8217;re constantly filling those seats. They&#8217;re giving away hardware and they&#8217;re working on bringing the best of everything they can to developers. Look beyond the constant headlines proclaiming their death and you&#8217;ll see there is plenty of people interested in where RIM is going right now.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple, really. They&#8217;re building something new, something fresh and while it&#8217;s still unknown how well that&#8217;ll work out for them, people still want more than Android and iOS. Realistically, MS isn&#8217;t in any better shape then RIM is right now with the exception of the fact MS has a lot of money to float around. Needless to say, having a ton of cash doesn&#8217;t help very much at the end of the day of product is left on the shelves.</p>
<p>And of course, MS will still be alive if WP 8 fails but I was strictly speaking of their smartphone space. :P</p>
<p>The problem RIM has, is that MS essentially closed the gap in enterprise security that RIM had compared to other platforms and MS has an strong offering to below thirty consumers on the platform as well.</p>
<p>RIM seems to generally only have a target in enterprise. Which means MS can assault the market from two sides, RIM only has one strong entry point.</p>
<p>What are you talking about Microsoft doesn&#8217;t have any foot hold on security..mb the computer business market but nothing mobile. More android and IOS are being used in the industry</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 surpasses Blackberry in security. You might as well face it, RIM is dead and Windows Phone is the defacto third mobile platform.</p>
<p>You really need to check your information as thats one area RIM simply cannot be beat, partially to their detriment.</p>
<p>What&#8230;?  WP8 isn&#8217;t even out.</p>
<p>Yeah, you might look up your information.</p>
<p>Bla1ze, you should show up here more often if only to correct some of the crap I have to wade through here by every self proclaimed armchair CEO who seems to know how better RIM should be run. What surprises me the most is how people who hate a device and the company so much, continue to comment on stories regarding it.</p>
<p>I smell the stench of astroturfing.</p>
<p>&gt;MS isn’t in any better shape then RIM is right now</p>
<p>So blackberry also has an OS that dominates the pc and server world? Blackberry has a gaming console that is directly competing with Nintendo and Sony?</p>
<p>So what does blackberry have? An new OS that no one has seen yet? Hardware no one has seen yet? Android, iOS, and win8 just showed off all their cool stuff and BB&#8217;s answer to that is &#8220;at least our developers still think we&#8217;re awesome&#8221;?</p>
<p>Can someone tell me ONE thing that blackberry has that no one else has? ONE thing that makes people want to leave android or iOS?</p>
<p>I love you guys and all, but I wish that stories like this, that are just clearly smoke and mirrors BS, would stop getting posted. It&#8217;s one thing to follow press fluff-filled press conferences, but it&#8217;s another to publish misleading garbage like this.</p>
<p>Can someone just buy them already? Where&#8217;s HP when you need them?</p>
<p>Not leaving?  Last I heard RIM has already fired thousands of their own employees.</p>
<p>If RIM keeps up these misrepresentations, the shareholders are going to sue their ass right into the ground as soon as the music stops.</p>
<p>Frankly I think trying to go after iOS and Android market share is foolhardy at this point, those two are so ingrained in the public consciousness&#8230;  as a Canadian I would dearly love for RIM to succeed, but collapse seems inevitable at this point..</p>
<p>What they SHOULD have done is work with Governments to make sure that Blackberry servers met or exceeded Government security standards, put all the checks and balances where they need to be,  and make something PROPERLY designed to get back all of those corporate contracts they&#8217;ve lost over the last few years, and maybe get some government and even military contracts..  leave iOS and Android to the Angry Birds set and go do some WORK.</p>
<p>They still own most of the enterprise market, as much as they have lost in the Enterprise sector, its quite minuscule in comparison to the consumer market and is even more true for governments who demand even more security than the average enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>well, that&#8217;s just pathetic. it somehow reminds me of a dying dictatorship. yeah, that&#8217;s what management is in RIM.</strong></p>
<p>What do you want them to do? Damned if they do damned if they don&#8217;t.  RIM spouting doom = everyone confirms loss of hope, RIM spouts positivity = RIM is delusional.</p>
<p>What do I want them to do?</p>
<p>Die a quick death and let the adults play, it&#8217;s going to happen eventually. Though watching the RIM fans flounder in these comments section is pretty fun.</p>
<p>I hate having options.</p>
<p>RIM is full of **** !</p>
<p>BB10 seems like an OS where I&#8217;m going to be thinking &#8220;I want this too be good and I see where they&#8217;re going, but competition is better at this.&#8221; I also can&#8217;t wait to see Josh&#8217;s interview with the RIM CEO.</p>
<p>Alec lives in the same alternate reality those two former co-CEOs live in.</p>
<p>Why are people so defensive about their platforms? Just wait and see how it all works out.</p>
<p>Everyone at RIM has thier heads buried in sand.</p>
<p>I have been deving BlackBerry apps for the last year and a half and have loved it. I made an app and submitted it to all of the major platforms out there and earned 100 times more on BB than on iOS. I&#8217;ve made about 20 PlayBook apps so far and have earned over $200/hr for my efforts. I went to BB10 jam and had a great time, and I&#8217;ve had a great experience deving for BB10 so far. It would be great if more devs checked out BB10 although I&#8217;d be smart to shut up so there is less development competition for the millions of BB10 owners in the next couple of years.</p>
<blockquote>I made an app and submitted it to all of the major platforms out there and earned 100 times more on BB than on iOS. I’ve made about 20 PlayBook apps so far and have earned over $200/hr for my efforts</blockquote>
<p>Which app? Flix? That would be because iOS already has a Netflix client which is free and far more full-featured. And doesn&#8217;t rely on a host PC.</p>
<p>Your other &#8216;apps&#8217; are more like utilities to replicate functions that are built into the other OSs or covered by quality apps. The problem here is that you may be hoping that these shortfalls persist into BB10 so that there is a market for your work, but if they persist, BB10 will be well behind the competition and a poor consumer choice.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my blog post about my love (or lack thereof) of negativity and disprect from internet commenters:</p>
<p><a href="http://playbookdev.net/document.pl?mode=Display&DocumentID=936" target="_blank">http://playbookdev.net/document.pl?mode=Display&amp;DocumentID=936</a></p>
<p>Apps are apps. Android and iOS have notification apps that mimic blackberries notification system but they are still apps and they still make money.  Someone is successful and helping to explain why developers could be interesting in BB.  Why does this upset you?</p>
<p>Gotta love how Internet commentors are able to spin any positive thing into a negative discouragement. Well done sir.</p>
<p>And no, I didn&#8217;t build Flix for the other platforms, since Android and iOS have Netflix-built apps.</p>
<p>I like how you wrote &#8220;your other &#8216;apps&#8217; are more like&#8230;&#8221; with &#8220;apps&#8221; in quotation marks, as if to question that they are worthy of the term &#8220;app&#8221;. Are you this disrespectful with your friends and family?  And if not, why do you feel the need to be so ungenerous with me?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m probably just in the way of you slamming BlackBerry, so I shouldn&#8217;t take such offence.</p>
<p>The supreme irony of a RIM CEO talking about &#8220;the real world&#8221; is too much for me to consider on a Monday morning.</p>
<p>I think they have the OS down because from what i have experienced BB 10 is really really smooth and flows well.  I agree in a OS sense it&#8217;s above Windows, but the main problem for me in the lack of apps.  Even when Blackberry wasn&#8217;t sinking their apps were terrible and they had few apps.  Now your starting from scratch with no real app base.</p>
<p>I made a suggestion in another forum that they port 50-100 of the top Android/Apple apps and give users $100 credit</p>
<p>Either way it&#8217;s a huge uphill battle.  I used to own a 9930 (formerly iPhone 4) and one day just snapped and sold it and bought a Galaxy Nexus.  Between the constant freezing, OS crashing, and lack of apps I had enough.  I really do hope Rim succeeds and maybe one day I will come back.</p>
<p>Secondly even though the CEO of RIM has poked at Nokia, he should take a hint and do something radical (in terms for RIM) style wise like the Lumia 900.  Stop giving us the same Curve/Bold look or a rounded thick slab of poor performing plastic.</p>
<p>But who is going to licence it?</p>
<p>HTC? Samsung? LG?</p>
<p>I agree, HTC, Samsung and LG will be ready to sell anything.<br />
BlackBerry still has a brand name that is worth more than HTC, Samsung or LG.</p>
<p>Maybe LG,  i dont think Blackberry&#8217;s name is stronger than HTC or Samsung tho. Except for the strong urge ppl get to throw their phone when they think about all the stuff their blackberry cant do.</p>
<p>no one</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t see manufactures like Samsung or HTC taking on another platform when they already have Android &amp; Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Huawei, come on down!</p>
<p>A wild ZTE was spotted coming down as well!</p>
<p>Samsung stated a while ago that they are an O.S. whore and will do any O.S.</p>
<p>Yes but they only seem to do one well.</p>
<p>I can see Samsung doing it. They aren&#8217;t going to lose anything. They have the infrastructure to manufacturer more BB10 devices in a month than RIM can in a year.</p>
<blockquote>we don’t have the economy of scale to compete against the guys who crank out 60 handsets a year&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>What about the guy who cranks out 1 handset a year?</p>
<p>That guy can release the same phone under a different name on each carrier. Introducing the BlackBerry 10,000 4g LTE super touch elite enterprise with BlackBerry O.S. 10.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not talking about BlackBerry. He&#8217;s talking about another fruit-based company who can produce massive numbers of handsets in one year.</p>
<p>Apple did not even cross my mind. In that case, they can err&#8230; team up with Microsoft to completely dominate enterprise?</p>
<p>Cause RIM doesn&#8217;t have the best industrial design talent and PR department in the world.</p>
<p>Honestly, I just can&#8217;t imagine any of the major players paying RIM for a BB10 license at this point&#8230;</p>
<p>Diversification. </p>
<p>RIM is toast.  Next up: bidding for RIM&#8217;s patent portfolio.</p>
<p>The thing is, the BB10 smartphones (made by RIM) will be directed towards the high-med-end markets but in developing markets (where BB7 is huge) RIM is going to need someone to get these phones out to be able to compete with cheap Android devices.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a smart move in my opinion. They see BB10 as more than just an OS for a smartphone but as a platform for devices OTHER than phones (think TVs, cars, ATMs; etc) and they don&#8217;t need to make cars or TVs to have BB10 running on there.</p>
<p>And while none of us have seen BB10, they believe it&#8217;s revolutionary and people WILL want to license it out, and that is what remains to be seen.</p>
<p><img src="http://cache.daylife.com/imageserve/04Fa3mI13Qgiw/656x544.jpg" height="200" width="260" /></p>
<p>You will all praise BB10 when it&#8217;s released. It&#8217;s like Android on steriods (and C++) with a real-time OS (QNX)</p>
<p>Perhaps we will. But I hope BB has kepy  up with advances in their rivals (OS 6 and WP8 release this year; Google is probably working on KeyLime already) .. as BB10 has been delayed</p>
<p>WebOS was technologically superior to iOS and Android when it launched, too.</p>
<p>Not really. Doing apps in javascript might be a technological feat, but I&#8217;d hardly call it objectively superior. Part of the gripes with WebOS was the poor performance and bad battery life. Those flaws are not unrelated to favoring interpreted languages over natively compiled code.</p>
<p>BB10 will not have that design choice, and will fail for entirely different reasons (lack of interest in a seriously late to the party OS).</p>
<p>Quite frankly we &amp; Joshua likes WebOS as well but that didn&#8217;t save it. :(</p>
<p>I agree they will Praise !!</p>
<p>What the hell does real-time OS mean? it sounds like a stupid ass talking point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/rtos-real-time-operating-system" target="_blank">http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/rtos-real-time-operating-system</a><br />
Symbian, Nokia OS aka ISA (upon which S40 and S30 are built), QNX and Nucleus which is the underlying OS of the Bada platform are the real time mobile OSes I&#8217;m aware of.</p>
<p> There must be a negative side to an RTOS-based phone because every one of those brands you mentioned collectively have single-digit market share. Are they just not marketed properly, or is there some fundamental problem with implementation?</p>
<p>there&#8217;s plenty of os&#8217;s that are anroid on steroids but things which are possible for every developer in android being locked only to preferred partners&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be surpised RIM survives long enough to release anything.</p>
<p>I bet other OS companies might license BB technology &#8211; or patents &#8211; perhaps their secure email platform? But I doubt if they would license the OS as a whole now &#8230;</p>
<p>I think they might as well sell to Apple and get it over with. It&#8217;s going to look like Palm all over again otherwise.</p>
<p>why would apple want to buy it?</p>
<p>Enterprise. They get RIM, and MS cries in a corner.</p>
<p>The enterprise features which will be available with an NT kernel Windows 8 Phone will surpass what Blackberry has ever delivered.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even see there being much of a practical difference between what&#8217;s already available in ActiveSync vs what BES offers.  Certainly not worth attaching another expensive point of failure to an Exchange server so my mail can route through Canada.</p>
<p>Exactly.  The BBS is an old service which doesn&#8217;t make sense in todays Enterprise system.</p>
<p>Maybe Facebook will trade some stock for it</p>
<p>Hahahahaha</p>
<p>I hope they have some success with BB10. It would be a wise move to licence it and try and saturate the market but what company will want it? I think it will have to be a proven seller before any one jumps on board with it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t envy this guy&#8217;s job.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty good really, he gets well paid and once some luckless tech firm buys RIM all his options vest and he gets 6 months gardening leave.</p>
<p>Who would want to license it? HTC and the major companies like Samsung I doubt would&#8230; Huawei and ZTE seem to be making very interesting android hardware. Only one is possibly Amazon&#8230;.</p>
<p>Of coarse BB10 is a &#8220;once in a decade&#8221; project, it will most likely have taken ten years to develop before it finally (if ever) gets released. Meanwhile, iOS and Android will be ten years ahead again.</p>
<p>BB10 is the Duke Nukem of phone OSes.</p>
<p>The question they&#8217;re asking is &#8220;can someone manufacture a BB10 device for less than we can&#8221; and if so, why couldn&#8217;t they license BB10. I think it&#8217;s quite reasonable. If the license fee is reasonable and the OS scales down well on different or lower end devices, then why not. The end result could me more BB10 handsets.</p>
<p>Apple has proved though that you don&#8217;t need 60 handsets a year. They have one a year yet earn a huge profitshare and marketshare.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about how good it is, not how many there are.</p>
<p>I agree. If their mentality is that they need to have a bunch of different handsets then they still don&#8217;t have a clear understanding of what they need to be doing.</p>
<p>The only thing Apple has proved is not giving customers choices with more than 1 phone. People want different screen sizes. They should at least release a 3.5 and a 4.5 inch iPhone.</p>
<p>Number one selling phone year after year man. Obviously people don&#8217;t have a problem&#8230;</p>
<p>Sigh&#8230;until somebody has 100.0% market share you simply cannot say that. <br />
Anyway his suggestion of multiple screen sizes is about as ludicrous as multiple screen options on a MacBook. Oh&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see why one would want to license it. There is already Android and Windows Phone out there for OEM to use, and I don&#8217;t see BB10 has any advantage over them.</p>
<p>It only makes sense for OEM to license it <em><strong> if</strong></em>  BB10 had shipped, and was getting great reviews but not selling enough volume, something like webOS was around 2 years ago. RIM is in a position worse than the launch of Pre 3/TouchPad.</p>
<p>I think RIM is pretty much dead. They may think that BB10 is revolutionary but they thought the same thing about the Playbook. There&#8217;s just too many factors stacked against RIM. I mean who would even license it. I see some saying that it could compete against the cheap Android phones but the people who make the cheap Android phones are the same people who would probably license it so why license it and compete with yourself when you can just let it die. I think there&#8217;s about to be one less smartphone manufacturer.</p>
<blockquote>we don’t have the economy of scale to compete against the guys who crank out 60 handsets a year</blockquote>
<p>yeah its killing Apple.</p>
<p>beaten above.</p>
<p>BlackBerry Haters are gonna Hate.</p>
<p>Who cares what haters say? Haters didn&#8217;t delay BB10, or release a tablet without an email client &#8230; Haters aren&#8217;t stopping [fill-in-blank-with-your-hated-technology-company] from succeeded &#8230;</p>
<p>BB runs Android apps, they should just license themselves to Android OEMs as a service.</p>
<p>If you own stock I feel sorry for you.  Regardless of any loss you may have taken to date, you&#8217;d better sell and sell quick.  This company is circling the drain.</p>
<p>Has the OEM business model that involves licensing different OSes and manufacturing and selling phones based on them proven to be a runaway success for both the OEM and the OS vendor?  Sure Samsung and HTC makes Android and WP7 phones. Obviously, Samsung&#8217;s cash cow is the Android business and they could have very well  dropped WP7 and still make money. Their support for WP7 seems half-hearted. The same could be said of HTC with the big difference that HTC is in a slump while Samsung is making money.</p>
<p>Nowadays the emphasis is on end-to-end hardware+software+ecosystem integration and for an OEM to equally support more than one platform can be difficult. So it&#8217;s perfectly understandable that Samsung put most of its marbles behind Android. I can&#8217;t imagine Samsung or HTC supporting a third platform.  With the costs involved in designing and bringing a phone to market, OEMs should choose the platform they think is best. Only OEMs with infinite resources can afford to hedge. So maybe deep-pocketed Chinese vendors are the likely candidates to license BB10.</p>
<p>Much has been said about Nokia putting all its marbles behind Windows Phone. At least Nokia has made its stance that they think Windows Phone is the better platform for them. They didn&#8217;t publicly hedge their bets by simultaneously bringing out Android phones.  Of course privately, they may have Android in their development labs.)  They did  got something in return from Microsoft in the deal.</p>
<p>In the end I&#8217;m not even sure if the market itself can sustain so many platforms. Developers have limited resources and will prioritize the platform with the widest audience.</p>
<p>Samsung already have a third platform coming: Tizen.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tizen</a></p>
<p>Personally, I believe Samsung hopes that with enough popular platforms under it&#8217;s belt, it can eventually be the dominant player (rather than carrier or platform vendor).</p>
<p>Forget licensing BB10, license BBM I would gladly pay per month to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Sony</strong> will be all over this you can bet good $$$ that if Apple doesn&#8217;t buy RIM just to bury it. That Sony will use BB10 and the QNX platform and it&#8217;s hooks into the embedded market to extend their reach even further Windows is extending 8 to the Xbox, Sony needs something to continue to compete. Who knows the things Sony could do with BB10 Sony does almost everything. <br />
Even Samsung <em>could</em> hop in but Samsung and  Google their success is so intertwined that it wouldn&#8217;t make much sense. Essentially they are saying they need help producing low end at a better cost proposition than where Blackberry a reasonably small player can produce.<br />
Heins goes on to say, <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;You could think about us building a reference system, and then basically licensing that reference design, have others build the hardware around it &#8211; either it&#8217;s a BlackBerry or it&#8217;s something else being built on the BlackBerry platform .&#8221;</blockquote><br />
That &#8220;something else&#8221; will allow OEMs to build their OWN custom UIs and create &#8220;differentiation&#8221; they can&#8217;t all &#8220;beat um and join um&#8221; Samsung is the only  reasonably profit making Android OEM really. The rest of the guys are just breaking even on an OS that is most popularized by 1 brand. They need to differentiate in order to pull the public away from the duopoly within the carriers who are at the balls of these guys, and the consumers who really have two/three choices for a great smartphone. Throwing all the OEMS at Android has proven that Samsung is the only one with the cost proposition to make the phones and make money.<br />
With BB10 the OEMS will be able to take the software they bake into android and bake it into BB10 and all the new things it will bring after the bloodbath of consumers buy new Apple products these next two quarters as Microsoft starts flooding their Windows 8 tablets into the mix with all the new Android ones.</p>
<p>Come on RIM! I want to cheer you on simply because variety is healthier for the phone market.</p>
<p>Nah, nothing that RIM has brought to the table in the past 5+ years has been healthy for the phone market.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s like keeping a decomposing cadaver around: it may provide variety, but you still need to bury it at some point.</p>
<p>I would rather they stayed alive myself. Two mobile operating systems (or even three) is not enough &#8230;</p>
<blockquote>We fully intend to lead in the QWERTY segment</blockquote>
<p>Because that approach has been working thus far.</p>
<p>Very few people demand a physical keyboard these days, and a large screen + keyboard isn&#8217;t a popular option. I think that most consumers want a larger screen first and foremost, a hardware keyboard is secondary. Other companies haven&#8217;t really pursued the market because the market is simply waning everyday.</p>
<p>Not a popular option, but it is something that some people want.<br />
RIM just needs to get used to the fact that it won&#8217;t be like it was before the iPhone and then Android.  They will be 3rd or 4th place and they just need to carve out a niche and accept that they are not going to be the biggest.</p>
<p>they probably do accept it. its just that they have fallen and will now get jeers from the internet audience.</p>
<p>They cannot be like that. They cater to enterprise and enterprises don&#8217;t buy number 4 because it&#8217;s too risky in terms of long-term support etc. They cannot cater to consumers because they don&#8217;t know how.</p>
<p>They should embrace themselves and go into oblivion.</p>
<p>Actually it is, BB outsells iPhone by a wide margin.</p>
<p>outselling iPhones and actually making a profit doing it, are two very different things.</p>
<p>Well, yes. But they have the channels, so if they make a compelling product, no reason why they cant make some cash, long as they dont go bust in the meantime.</p>
<p>Ive said it before and say it again, its never too late, long as they can keep the cashflow going.</p>
<p>The very customers that got RIM to where it used to be (Enterprise) are now flocking to Android and iPhones in mass droves. Those channels are closing, and closing rapidly.</p>
<p>They also gained an unexpected market lately, the &#8216;Yoof&#8217; market. Around these parts, anyone under 19 has a BB, you see them everywhere you go. If they can keep hold of that market as they mature into adulthood, might be a chance.</p>
<p>Saying that, Eldar say BB10 is dead and we will never see it, so who knows.</p>
<p>In which uncharted, unknown territory? Apple sells 34 million iPhones a quarter. . . RIM has never sold more than 52 million in a year.</p>
<p>Quite a few territories actually, Dubia for one and they are toe to toe in UK. (at least they were, havent checked lately, but they still have a large install base.)</p>
<p>Oh ffs, Dubai.</p>
<p>Please can we have editing and notifications. Getting silly now.</p>
<p>This it would be great if they can implement the &#8220;1 minute editting period&#8221; for us to do our post-posting spell checking. After that 1 minute is due, feel free to cease the editing period.</p>
<p>India too. Hardly anyone has an iPhone. Almost everyone I know has a Blackberry. #2 popularity is Android.</p>
<p>This. I can vouch for this as well. Last time I went there (around February) I found that the majority of smartphone user in India uses BB as well. And that&#8217;s not a small number.</p>
<p>They still pretty much rule the South East Asia. 250+ Million people in Indonesia alone where the smartphone market has just started to bloom and around 60-70% of the potential market still sees Blackberry as a choice. Especially since the iPhone and Hi-End Android phone is pretty much a very luxury item only the rich can buy. A friend of mine has a phone retail shop and according to him, it is estimated that every 10 BB smartphone sold, only 6-7 Android smartphone (with the ratio of Hi-End Android ($600+) vs Mid/Lower End Android being sold at 60:40) and 1 iPhone sold. But of course that is just a statistic from a single phone retailer so it validity is arguable at best, but I hope it can give you some kind of picture.</p>
<p>RIM indeed lost a big market in the US of A, thus the loss, butIMO they still managed to stay fairly healthy in other region.</p>
<p>They should just make toasters or something.  Smartphone game is lost for RIM</p>
<p>jokers</p>
<p>R.I.P. RIM</p>
<p>That is the theme for today, as much as I&#8217;d hate to say it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see RIM going with a two-pronged approach for its BB10 devices, but that&#8217;s a long way away. As it stands, we&#8217;re 6-9 months away from an actual release of these devices; in that time frame, we&#8217;ll see the launch of a more powerful WP8, the next iteration of the juggernaut that is the iPhone, and a whole assortment of high end Android devices. We&#8217;ve seen what the latest OSes offer for WP8, iOS6, and Android Jellybean, but there&#8217;s sure to be more surprises ahead. What can RIM possibly offer that will be a compelling choice for consumers to let go of one of the more advanced/mature OSes to something that is essentially starting all over again? Look at how long it&#8217;s taking MSFT to gain traction in this market, and it&#8217;s balance sheet is still as healthy as it has been.</p>
<p>From the previews I&#8217;ve seen of BB10 and the Playbook, the OS has some nice things going for it but nothing that is truly innovative or something that will fundamentally change how we use our mobile devices. Good luck RIM, but I think that the time is here to accept your fate and move on with other strategic options that may just in fact be mandatory.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt they have some great stuff in the pipeline, but aren&#8217;t they running a little behind?! Like years behind, and counting?&#8230; Are they waiting for their loyal fan base to vanish first?</p>
<p>Thats a good point, they are so late to this move its crazy. <br />
Unlike other posters I don&#8217;t think they are as good as dead, but they will never be as big as they were.  Likely 3rd behind Apple and Google, and if they don&#8217;t step it up ,and quick, they will be 4th behind MSFT or dead.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s room for &#8220;Bada and others&#8221; in the OS pie, then there&#8217;s room for Blackberry 10 &#8212; &#8220;..and others&#8221; part.</p>
<p>Now, if I had to bet, I would say (especially in light of WP8 and Jelly Bean) that someone finally realized that releasing a touch-only device (when qwerty is one of the only real advantages RIM has left) would kill not only the  touch device, but also any buzz the qwerty device would have.  I would not be at all surprised if they are just holding the touch device until the qwerty device is ready, just to have some (albeit probably small) chance at regaining stature in the US market.</p>
<p>Plus, there is probably some logic in staying out of the maelstrom created by the confluence of WP8, iPhone6, and the next nexus phone (assuming that is this fall too).  Fall always seemed too crowded as it is.</p>
<p>Not saying this is sound logic, but I can see wanting to delay to get a chance at the spotlight (vs practically being guaranteed to be overshadowed by someone, no matter what you introduce).</p>
<p>Insightful, I agree.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s really no place left for BlackBerry. Apple has the mainstream, Android has the variety, and Microsoft will soon have the corporate market.  We don&#8217;t need a fourth player, and we certainly don&#8217;t need  RIM.</p>
<p>RIM clears throat, hopes to be noticed.</p>
<p>alternate headline.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Heins.  He&#8217;ll never be the CEO of anything ever again after this. His only attempt was wasted trying to recover the titanic.</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;We fully intend to lead in the QWERTY segment&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to lead when you are the only one playing!</p>
<p>Too bad the QWERTY segment is shrinking!</p>
<p>I hear HP is feeling acquisitive&#8230;</p>
<p>I wonder if <a href="http://www.hasrimshippedbb10yet.com" target="_blank">www.hasrimshippedbb10yet.com</a> is taken?</p>
<p>nope.</p>
<p>I just bought <a href="http://www.isrimstillinbusiness.com" target="_blank">www.isrimstillinbusiness.com</a> for shits and giggles.</p>
<p>Why are they even bothering? I highly doubt they can pull off a better handset than Nokia N9. Was N9 a success? Nokia attempted all RIM is doing now and they realized it wasn&#8217;t going to be enough. Time to choose a side RIM</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work out and they get bought, I hope Amazon does it. Imagine, since they already have Android apps running on the Playbook, they probably could make a way to get all the apps on the appstore working and make that the main store.</p>
<p>FYI: Playbook = Fire, or at least nearly so.</p>
<p>Guess i will be the dissenting voice voice whos says RIM will do fine if BB10 is good.</p>
<p>Honestly I think the simplest solution for RIM to make a decent splash to at least get the curiosity factor is to make a all touch as big as the galaxy note. RIM does innovate when it comes to gestures, and with that large form factor they&#8217;ll have room to create</p>
<p>this thorsten dude is a clown and i don&#8217;t believe a word he says.  i think rim is kaput.</p>
<p>Sorry RIM. Time for you to go away. Your image is already dead. Sell your business, give your your workers huge bonuses and let go.<br />
It&#8217;s sad but it&#8217;s the truth.</p>
<p>I shall keep waiting for the BB10 QWERTY model.  I see no reason why RIM can&#8217;t lead in the QWERTY market.  No one out there makes a phone in that form factor, which is the one I want.  If some other company created a phone in that form factor that ACTUALLY works well (not just one where the keyboard is tacked on), I&#8217;d give it a shot.</p>
<p>They are taking sweet time. Where is that BB10 London??</p>
<p>Although I haven&#8217;t owned nor used any blackberry devices, I am still an advocate for more choices to the consumers regardless of preferences, so I hope RIM survives. This also includes you Nokia.  Good luck.</p>
<p>Is it just me or is it the same voice as Siri?</p>
<p>The reply voice seems very very Siri-like, yes.</p>
<p>To be fair every E voice sounds the same. My dads old GPS device sounds like siri and that was out before Siri.</p>
<p>Too be really fair, that isn&#8217;t true. The Google Now voice is much better. Also, the voices available via Speaktoit are worlds better.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t tried Google Now so I wouldn&#8217;t know but yeah you are right not all voices are the same but most devices go for the Siri voice.</p>
<p>Google Now voice is amazing, and the most natural sounding I&#8217;ve heard. Puts Siri to shame.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost natural, it&#8217;s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re reference should be to Google Voice Search. Google Now is a whole other service.</p>
<p>Considering the story about the british Siri voice Apple probably licensed their Siri voice from some third-party provider and maybe RIM licensed the same one.</p>
<p>The weird thing though is that the Siri voice is actually from OS X voice choices. The name for the voice is &#8220;Samantha&#8221;.</p>
<p>Either way, it&#8217;s too robotic compared to Google Now&#8217;s voice (although I feel like it sounds bitchy sometimes).</p>
<p>Apparently the voice is from Nuance according to commenters below. It still doesn&#8217;t help the argument that not everyone is copying Apple when the voice for a similar function is the same as Siri.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been hearing that voice for a LONG time before Siri was every brought to the iPhone.  In fact, I think I may have been hearing that voice before the original iPhone was ever released.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the Nuance voice, there is no &#8220;Siri&#8221; voice.</p>
<p>It sounds more like the iOS voice commands not Siri.</p>
<p>Just you. That doesn&#8217;t sound a thing like Siri.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/10/2551519/british-voice-of-siri-only-found-out-about-it-when-he-heard-himself?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/10/2551519/british-voice-of-siri-only-found-out-about-it-when-he-heard-himself?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a><br />
could be true</p>
<p>IMO the voice sounds like a combo of Siri and Tellme but a bit closer to Tellme.</p>
<p>Yes. This is Nuance&#8217;s <a href="http://nextupdownloads.com/scansamples/samantha.wav">Samantha</a>. And the male voice is Nuance&#8217;s <a href="http://nextupdownloads.com/scansamples/Daniel.wav">Daniel</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed the TomTom for iPhone app also uses Nuance voices.</p>
<p>You can also access all Nuance voices in Lion by going to System Preferences&#8594;Speech&#8594;Text to Speech and by selecting &#8220;Customize&#8230;&#8221; in the &#8220;System Voice&#8221; drop down.</p>
<p>Good to see them catching up. It might be a little late, but if they work hard, they can make small dents next year.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has licensed voice command from Nuance for a long time but never took it to the extent that Apple did. They are the same technology. Can&#8217;t say copycat, lawsuit, etc.</p>
<p>Bb10 is shaping pretty well !!</p>
<p>I hate that voice actions are inevitably compared to Siri. The technology existed before her.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re compared to Siri because all these companies are rapidly developing voice actions as direct reactions to Apple&#8217;s implementation of Siri, not because the technology was discovered years ago.  Sort of like how recently ultrabooks exploded only after the Macbook Air was released even though light and thin notebooks existed years ago (Sony Vaio x505 in 2004)</p>
<p>BB stop working on gimmicky feature. Focus on getting the UI, core apps and most importantly getting this OS into peoples hands as soon as possible.</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly</p>
<p>UI, core apps and all the rest are already done. It all has only to be integrated into the whole system. This isn&#8217;t only a gimmicky feature at all. In order to compete, BB10 is gonna need a full features list and such a virtual assistant belongs to it.</p>
<p>If the core of the phone were really done it wouldn&#8217;t have been quagmired for another year. In order to really compete, bb10 should&#8217;ve been released last month.</p>
<p>I want RIM to succeed, but if they want to save themselves they better get their asses in gear. Now.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t say &#8216;core of the phone&#8217;, I said &#8216;core apps&#8217;. But Heins says the entire package, the final product isn&#8217;t. I think it&#8217;s okay for them to launch in January, I mean what do the others do? They are only evolutionizing their products, Apple does that since 5 years ago. I don&#8217;t see any revolution out there and I don&#8217;t think this revolution will come with the iPhone 6 Gen either. RIM had to build a whole new platform from the ground up &#8211; under public eyes. Who else did that? Google and Apple were already working on their systems for years when they came out with them. To compete and rescue RIM, the final BB10 product simply has to be perfect and polished. One more PlayBook-story, and they&#8217;re dead. That&#8217;s why they took that extra time and I&#8217;m sure the BB10 phone will outperform any Quad-Core-Phone. Out there at launch.</p>
<p>I can vouch for that, have you seen the latest BB10 alpha browser sunspider and HTML5 test scores? they are leading the pack by a margin</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/bu9n7qn" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/bu9n7qn</a><br />
<a href="http://html5test.com/results/mobile.html" target="_blank">http://html5test.com/results/mobile.html</a></p>
<p>Yeah I&#8217;ve seen that&#8230;HTML5 score of 447. Even desktop browsers can&#8217;t compete with that.</p>
<p>You mean to tell me that RIM only has one person that can work on one thing at a time. Maybe that&#8217;s why they are so far behind.</p>
<p>Do you know how long it took Apple to create iOS? Good. Now think of how long it would&#8217;ve taken Apple to create iOS 6 from the ground up. And NOW let&#8217;s assume Apple, before they develop iOS 6 from the ground up, have to take care of finding a new kernel to build the platform on. Do you think anyone out there would manage this within two years? So shut up and don&#8217;t troll. It&#8217;s not as easy as it seems to be.</p>
<p>Yeah. That&#8217;s irrelevant really. BB had enough time to do it, now it just scrambling coz it sat on it butt for too long.. Well anyway, more power to them</p>
<p>No one can really say if they&#8217;re slow or lazy or whatever, because there isn&#8217;t any expamle you can compare it to in smartphone history. Nobody knows how long it took Apple or Google to develop their operating systems, because they could develop theirs behind closed doors with no pressure from the market. Even Windows Phone 7 is build up on Windows CE, Windows Phone 8 is build on Windows NT. Microsoft had experience with both kernels for years when they startet to build up the new platforms. But QNX? RIM bought QNX back in April 2010 and nobody even knows when they startet to build up BlackBerry 10 on it. And they had no experience on that one, nor is there any reference. QNX isn&#8217;t even an operating system, it&#8217;s only a microkernel architecture. Nobody knows if RIM had already enough time or not. The only thing that counts, is, wether BB10 is competitive at launch or not. What we know this far is, that its a unique architecture, the UI and its controls are totally different and the hardware will definitively be high end. Windows Phone 8 will work with the same chipsets. I think that&#8217;s an indicator, as everyone knows how smooth even WP7 already is.</p>
<p>Over 5 years late and still not here. No excuse for that.</p>
<p>They bought QNX 2 years ago, not 5 years ago. 5 years ago, they first had to realize that iOS is a danger. But it wasn&#8217;t at that time &gt; time loss. Then they had to ask themselves wether the classic BB OS is able to be competitive or not &gt; time loss. As they realized that it is not, they had to ask themselves wether to license a new OS or to build up a new one that is A competitive, B works with BIS and BES (also if this is even necessary), C isn&#8217;t a rip-off of the competitors and D builds the ground for a long-term future &gt; time loss. To release a QNX-based BB10 product at the right time RIM must have known in 2007 that the cassic BB OS wouldn&#8217;t have a future and that iOS and Android (which wasn&#8217;t even released at that time) would grow explosively around the globe, even in the enterprise sector (BYOD and &#8216;sh*t on security&#8217;). Unfortunately, RIM doesn&#8217;t manage clairvoyance. So better in January 2013 than never.</p>
<p>The guy in the video sound like he is gonna start crying&#8230;</p>
<p>Well if you worked for Crackberry wouldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Blaze (the person who made the video) works for androidcentral and imore as well.</p>
<p>Finally, something SVoice is better at.</p>
<p><strong>yawn</strong></p>
<p>The girl voice = Siri for US English<br />
The male voice = Siri for UK English</p>
<p>And for the human male voice? Lol it just sounds like he is on the verge of crying.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s the same voice as siri !</p>
<p>Apple has been using that voice for a long time. It is named Samantha, and has been a part of Mac OS for a while. Apple has been doing voice actions long before Google. In fact, Google&#8217;s voice actions were announced after Apple introduced Voice control in the 3GS.</p>
<p>The fact the RIM is wasting time on this suggests that they do not believe they can introduce a competitive product without something that answers the Siri question. They have made an extremely poor decision by using a voice that is the same, or similar enough for people to mistake it for the same as Siri. It invites comparisons to which they cannot live up. It also suggests that they want people to confuse it with Siri. They should have chosen a voice that was nothing like Siri. There are better voices out there. This is intentional, and will come back to bite them, if this product is ever released.</p>
<p>Lol. BB10 will differentiate from iOS in many, fundamental ways. No one will care about what certain voice the assistant will acually have.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s hope the differentiation works. Not only against iOS but also android and WP8</p>
<p>Yeah, the differentiation compared to all three is definitively there.  If it &#8216;works&#8217;, in sense of shipped devices, is a different question. I really hope so. I think just the form factor will be gorgeous. A handy 4.2 inch screen with 356 PPI, powered by a high end chipset which is world-LTE capable? Who else offers this? Of you want to have a high-end droid, you&#8217;ll get a 4.6 to 4.8 inch pocket TV you have to use with 2 hands at a time.</p>
<p>What a ridiculous comment.</p>
<p>I hope BB10 turns out nice. It looks promising.</p>
<p>This whole RIM situation reminds me of a song.</p>

<p>Blackberry, Windows Phone, Android and iPhone all competing against each other at the same level. We&#8217;re gonna see some amazing stuff in the next few years!</p>
<p>Haha, same level, rich.</p>
<p>true though..</p>
<p>Amazing</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a &#8220;BlackBerry&#8221;?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something you can speedly communicate with and also something where you don&#8217;t need any app only to comment an article. What&#8217;s an iPhone. Is it that open-close-thing which some people call &#8220;a phone for stupid people&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on an iPod touch, waiting to upgrade to an Android. You can be a jerk if you&#8217;d like, of course.</p>
<p>Aw, that&#8217;s adorable :3</p>
<p>something android does, and has been doing very well for some years now.</p>
<p>FYI..Blackberry had voice command before even Android debuted, Vlingo was on Blackberry before it made it to Android and IOS. Blackberry licensed Naunce since Pearl days (2006), it is only that they are evolving it in BB10</p>

<p>Looks very iPhone 4s-ish!</p>
<p>I cant get the nexus 4 on verizon so i might have to try this&hellip;&hellip;i&rsquo;ll make sure they quote the return policy several times but I&rsquo;m sure I can get a good feel on whether to keep it or return it within 3 days or so.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t get it for at least a few months. Any new platform is bound to have teething issues. Best to let the early adopters be the guinea pigs.</p>
<p>One might consider the PlayBook OS RIM&rsquo;s teething period with this OS.</p>
<p>People said the same thing for WP7.</p>
<p>Before everyone jumps ship from Android and iOs, I&rsquo;ve just one word of warning for you all:<br />
Storm.</p>
<p>Before everyone considers Android, I have just one word of warning for you all: G1.</p>
<p>(It&rsquo;s about as relevant, frankly).</p>
<p>The g1 was sweet</p>
<p>That would be backward thinking.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly fair to compare to the BB Storm simply because the device ran BBOS 5.0. With BB10 and an industry standard capacitive touch display, I don&rsquo;t see this device repeating what happened to with Storm.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m seriously considering this as my next phone. I tend to prefer Android, but between the Nexus 4 being unavailable on Verizon &mdash; or unavailable, period &mdash; and my seemingly insatiable desire for trying new things, this may be right up my alley. Either this or the Windows Phone 8X, though I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll really be able to embrace Windows Phone until they straighten out their multitasking and notification paradigms.</p>
<p>I took a long look at WP and the 8X for my next phone.  I think Microsoft is doing some really great things with WP and I expect it to be one of the top platforms in a couple years.  However, I think the platform needs that time to mature.  On the surface (no pun intended) WP does everything it needs to REALLY well.  But if you start to dig even just a little you start to realize that there&rsquo;s a lack of depth to features that a previous smartphone owner would have come to expect.  <br />
Beyond the OS itself, I found the app selection lacking.  I&rsquo;m not talking numbers or even necessarily which apps are available. Some of the ports of popular apps from other platforms received lower ratings on Windows Phone and have not achieved feature parity yet.  I was also surprised that there&rsquo;s a fair amount of WP7 apps that still haven&rsquo;t been updated for WP8 &mdash; which makes me question whether developers are feeling burned by Microsoft.<br />
In the end I decided there was too much up in the air to buy into Microsoft&rsquo;s platform at this point.</p>
<p>The main issue for me with windows phone right now is that I would prefer the OS operated differently in some respects&hellip;I would like a notification area&hellip;but seeing as we have live tiles, it should be more basic and well thought out&hellip;live tiles are actually pretty awesome and I never thought I would be that much of a fan of them but I am.</p>
<p>Regardless, at least Windows Phone has been out for some years now&hellip;RIM is just releasing basically a new fresh OS&hellip;there will be massive teething pains for the first year so if that is your worry, windows phone is the way to go&hellip;or of course the more used Android or iOS</p>
<p>@ guy2000, a Notification Hub is coming in WP8&rsquo;s next big update, which is scheduled for March.</p>
<p>And as bearded no!&lsquo;s said, WP8, out the box, has the most features and integration than any other OS. Where as, with the other OS&rsquo;s, you need to get the apps to really &ldquo;open up&rdquo; the OS. Because WP lacked apps when it first came out, Microsoft took the smart approach to add a lot of app functionality directly into the OS.</p>
<p>Are you serious right now? Windows Phone 8 has more features out of box than any other platform and further depth of them as well that would require downloading apps right away to make up for, whereas Windows Phone, it&rsquo;s ALREADY there. Windows Phone 7 apps aren&rsquo;t being ported with a huge demand as they already work on Windows Phone 8, and that needs to seen to developers if it&rsquo;s worth the updating of code. Microsoft&rsquo;s offering is better and more matured than RIM&rsquo;s latest offering that has taken over a year to come to market, let alone the SERIOUS problems it faces with media content and services. Contrast this to Windows Phone, where Microsoft is getting the top 46 out of 50 apps between ios and android onto Windows Phone in the coming months, already have a large music marketplace in place, has the best tie up between the PC and smartphone out there, and best tie up to the Xbox and smartphone. If you bought the Blackberry 10, it&rsquo;d be like buying an LG Optima with Windows Phone 7 on day one of release, you won&rsquo;t be getting much until a good year or so.</p>
<p>I have to question if you&rsquo;re even Windows Phoning right&hellip;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the SERIOUS problems it faces with media content and services</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought there were already over 70k apps for BB10, inlcuding most of the top ones from other platforms?  They&rsquo;re also easily ported from Android (cue comments about Android apps being stolen) and there are a whole host of options for developing native apps too.  Didn&rsquo;t WP8 launch with ~5k apps?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>large music marketplace</p>

<p>Aren&rsquo;t RIM using 7Digital?</p>

<p>Why do I need to link my smartphone to my PC?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>best tie up to the Xbox and smartphone</p>

<p>Not everyone has an Xbox.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m weird for looking forward to a new platform and seeing some healthy competition in the smartphone market.  I&rsquo;d like to see RIM succeed but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I want to see others fail.  I seem to be in the minority with that attitude though.</p>
<p>920 owner. I haven&rsquo;t seen any links between my Windows 8 PC and my phone. If anything, Apple and Google beat it pretty handily (Google with ties to its desktop/web and phone services, Google Music, etc; Apple with iMessage, wireless iTunes syncing, etc.) I thought there would be some great integration between W8 and WP8 but where the hell is it?</p>
<p>SkyDrive and Office. You can start writing a note in OneNote on your PC and see it right on your phone or you can access and share every file on your synced SkyDrive folder on your PC while you are on the go.</p>
<p>Evernote works the same way as OneNote, and SkyDrive is available for Android, iOS (and likely BB10) as well.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t said that these features are exclusive to WP.</p>
<p>Hahahaha he said one note&#8230;.. Thanks for the laugh</p>
<p>I use a Windows Phone and, sorry to say, most of your post is propaganda.  And a lot of it is recycled criticism of WP itself.</p>
<p>First of all, many Windows Phone 7 apps don&rsquo;t work well (or at all) on WP8.  Most WP7 apps display a &ldquo;black border&rdquo; at the top, so I lose a big chunk of screen real estate on my 8X.  Spotify for WP7 doesn&rsquo;t work &mdash; I had to cancel my subscription because of Microsoft&rsquo;s claim that WP7 apps would all work.  The Chase app stopped working on WP8 because Microsoft changed the way photos are handled, so now I cannot do remote deposits.  Other apps don&rsquo;t work correctly with GPS.  And so on.</p>
<p>Microsoft botched the launch by making the SDK available on the same day as the OS.  For the next several months, the Windows Phone 8 app experience will continue to SUCK until developers can release apps.</p>
<p>RIM, in contrast, has had an SDK out for almost a year now.  Their apps will be perfectly optimized on launch day.</p>
<p>Media content and services &mdash; well, let&rsquo;s talk about that.  Spotify used to work&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t work anymore.  Xbox Music is a massive steaming pile of poo.  Music Sync to desktop or W8 tablet is quite possibly the worst sync experience ever offered for a mobile device and personal computer (and yes, I am including the Atari Portfolio &mdash;&gt; Atari ST sync system in there).  Rdio doesn&rsquo;t have a full-featured client.  There&rsquo;s no Google YouTube client that is actually &ldquo;official,&rdquo; so MetroTube breaks every time Google feels malicious.  And so on.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;46 of the top 50 apps,&rdquo; Microsoft has not only NOT gotten there yet, it hasn&rsquo;t put up a timeline.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and then there&rsquo;s the update problem.  RIM will do OTA updates without carrier interference.  Microsoft allowed carriers to delay Portico by months AND refuse to deliver it as an OTA update&hellip; you cannot download it over HSPA or LTE, you have to hook up to a WiFi network to download it.  Even Palm allowed Pre phones to be updated over 3G back in 2009.  Another poor user experience.</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 has been extremely disappointing for me.  It&rsquo;s more crash-prone than 7, lacks access to much of the app library that 7 had, costs more, has less battery life, and more empty promises.  The media features of 8 are a step BACKWARDS from Zune on 7, and the fanboyism has cranked up TO MASSIVELY LOUD LEVELS (!!!) to make up for the horrendous execution and botched launch.</p>
<p>I want to love my 8X, but every crash and random reboot (even after &ldquo;Portico&rdquo;) makes me love it less and less.  And that&rsquo;s after Microsoft had screwed over the userbase twice before in just 24 months, with the killing off of WM 6.5 and WP7.</p>
<p>RIM, meanwhile, looks to be putting user experience front and center.  No screwing of the users, no broken promises, no half-assed untested beta-quality stuff in the production release, no releasing SDKs only on launch day.  They&rsquo;ve polished it, worked hard, and treated it as a premiere product rather than an afterthought.  And if they kick Microsoft&rsquo;s ass, it&rsquo;s because Microsoft deserves it.</p>
<p>Wow, seriously delusional?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&ldquo;No screwing of the users&rdquo; &ndash; how about requiring their tablet users to also have a BlackBerry smartphone to be able to check email?, They hoped for a year the &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; would work. What about a 4-day outage when no one could use email, IM, and pretty much all BB services?<br />
&ldquo;no broken promises,&rdquo; &ndash; the Java player for PlayBook comes to mind, that never materialized; the promise of a native email, calendar in 14 days after PlayBook release that happened exactly a year after. <br />
&ldquo;no half-assed untested beta-quality stuff in the production release,&rdquo; &ndash; right, have you used the Video Chat on PlayBook? It deleted all my contacts on OS update FFS!!! Email stopped working and got stuck on a draft message not being able to send.</p>
<p>What are you smoking?</p>
<p>Ummm&hellip; the discussion is about BlackBerry 10 and Windows Phone 8, not PlayBook OS from two years ago.</p>
<p>No, the discussion was specifically about RIM</p>
<p>In which case you&rsquo;d have to look at every botched patch, bugged software release and service outage Microsoft has ever had.  Ever.  I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a fair comparison.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>Plus blackberry has the lead&#8230;so I only see it getting stronger and wp is going out</p>
<p>You just referenced the Playbook, which is an example of RIM launching a product too early. BB10&rsquo;s year long SDK and them delaying it because they knew they had to somewhat dispels that notion. While we are at it, comparing irrelevant topics, lets compare this to Vista, Windows 8 store launch, and any other Microsoft failure ever. This is also RIM&rsquo;s first major product under a new CEO, which makes your comparisons even less relevant&hellip;</p>
<p>You just explained almost every problem I had in the short weeks that I had owned a Lumia 920.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t need lot&rsquo;s of apps (my case) you will do fine&hellip; its a superb phone ;)</p>
<p>Tried windows phone 8 also, and coming from win p 7.5 is the continuity, nothing really new to see, wich is great&hellip; but not for me&hellip; I get fad up really easy&hellip; and win p7.5 is still my OS of choice for the time being.</p>
<p>This one brings back a lot of cool stuff from webOS&hellip; even unlocking the lock screen has something familiar, that is a serious pun/kudos to webos.</p>
<p>It will be my next!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve already pre-ordered the Z10. I&rsquo;m getting sick of looking at my current phone which is an iPhone 5. Back to BlackBerry!!!</p>
<p>How will the Z10 improve your cell phone capabilities from the iPhone 5?</p>
<p>No one really knows&hellip;<br />
I can understand the BB addicts buying a new device on a new OS without any real reviews or hands on time as they probably would regardless&hellip;.<br />
For everyone else I think waiting 6 months after the release is a bit more realistic&hellip;</p>
<p>6 months might be more practical but I think 1 or 2 might suffice for most techheads that have a revolving door of devices anyway.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re conflating neophilia with technophilia.</p>
<p>You sir, are absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Upvote for introducing me to two new terms. Thank you.</p>
<p>I forgot that most of us have more money than sense&hellip;however for us in Canada to get it on contract requires a 3 year deal and upgrades before that cost $$$ most of the time so we have to be careful&hellip;unless you buy off contract and sell it after a year or so</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see a hip young person seriously considering a BlackBerry these days, except in an attempt to be ironic. The only people looking at these are the people who fondly remember their BB from their days flying first class in the early &rsquo;00s.</p>
<p>Maybe he has seen stuff that he thought was really cool in the leaked videos and wants to get it? Gestures? Multitasking? How smooth it is on pre preduction hardware and software? I don&rsquo;t know what it was, but even my excitment for BB10 wouldn&rsquo;t make me preorder it before final specs are shown, the launch, the reviews, or any bug reports for it. That is just insane&hellip;</p>
<p>what kind of price point are we looking at for the Z10, unlocked?</p>
<p>Seeing how the Bold 9900 still sits on store shelves for &pound;450, I won&rsquo;t be surprised if this one&rsquo;s price is set even higher! Ridiculous pricing for something that can&rsquo;t do much!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>something that can&rsquo;t do much</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh?!</p>
<p>Why spread FUD all over?</p>
<p>Makes people feel better about themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous pricing for something that can&rsquo;t do much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And you know this how?</p>
<p>He was talking about the bold 9900</p>
<p>Was he?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be surprised if this one&rsquo;s price <strong>is set even higher</strong>! Ridiculous pricing for something that can&rsquo;t do much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way he said it right after the part about talking about the Z10 being priced higher, I assumed he meant that the higher pricing of the Z10 was rediculous on something that is severely lacking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The image also further affirms that the first BlackBerry 10 devices will be touchscreen-only</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The image affirms that the Z10 will be touchscreen only; the X10 is well-known to be a portrait QWERTY. It&rsquo;s expected to be announced at the same time as the Z10.</p>
<p>The Qwerty version will be announced at the same time, but probably not in stores until 2 months after the L-series&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s that clear at this point.  Besides, it still has nothing to do with the image above.</p>
<p>True, that picture just confirms that the all-touch device is named the Z10, which was pretty much widely known.<br />
Also widely known is that the X10 will not be available at the same time as the Z10, and I believe it came out yesterday that a new SDK is required for the X10, and that new SDK will be available at or around January 30th.</p>
<p>What makes you think it won&rsquo;t come out at the same time?</p>
<p>there was an article a while back saying the Qwerty&rsquo;s will not be released in line with the full touch screen, I&rsquo;d expect to see a 6 month delay.</p>
<p>I hardly doubt a 6 month delay&hellip;</p>
<p>They said it will be released about 6 weeks after the full touchscreen model, so maybe March.</p>
<p>I hate to be a Debbie Downer, but I think this device will fail hard, mostly due to playbook style OS.</p>
<p>The OS is nothing at all like the playbook.  And even if it was, the playbook OS was pretty good.  Lack of apps and no corporate email (wtf) made that fail.</p>
<p>So why did it keep failing and didn&rsquo;t sell even after it got email and many games? It barely sold 1M after more than a year (!). Where is the guarantee this new device can prevent such a failure?</p>
<p>First, there is no guarantee. Especially at this time in this industry.</p>
<p>Second, it&rsquo;s ridiculous to rate a product&rsquo;s value to a person based on how well it sells afterwards. I know many playbook owners that LOVE them.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t sell because nobody wanted a Blackberry tablet. There was no demand. Nada. People want iPads and slowly, but surely, are buying some Android tablets too. Microsoft is likely to sell a few as well.</p>
<p>So what is different? RIM is changing what a Blackberry IS for the first time &ndash; trying something fresh and innovative. Will they succeed? Who knows, they&rsquo;ve got a long uphill battle ahead.</p>
<p>Anyone who loves technology though should be happy that there IS competition and there IS innovation happening. It makes live more diverse, more interesting, and benefits all of us in the end.</p>
<p>Good luck to RIM, on behalf of all tech users. Thank you for trying something new.</p>
<p>Playbook might have even sold more than Microsoft Surface, meanwhile, in PC World&rsquo;s annual reader satisfaction survey, which polled 45,000 site users about the reliability and performance of their desktop PC, laptops, smartphones, tablets and peripherals, the RIM BlackBerry PlayBook came fourth, just one place behind Apple in third.</p>
<p>Overall, owners were very happy with the product and in category-specific tables it actually came top for the quality of its display, beating not only Apple, but Samsung and Asus (maker of the Nexus 7) too while it was ranked fourth for speed and design and joint second for battery life.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thenewage.co.za/75200-1021-53-RIMs_PlayBook_surprises_in_sales_and_customer_satisfaction" target="_blank">http://www.thenewage.co.za/75200-1021-53-RIMs_PlayBook_surprises_in_sales_and_customer_satisfaction</a></p>
<p>It was an ealier product which was maybe overpriced &ndash; if they failed it was at making the device at a cheaper cost to fight it out in the sub 200-300$ field. At 200$ there&rsquo;s tons of value in it and the build quality of the tablet is very high. The device got 6.7 on the Verge, whereas many other tablets from well known manufacturers failed. But there was damage made to the brand by different stakeholders who targeted it, to trigger a sale of the IP portfolio I would imagine. Also most likely a reaction to a non-US company controlling high level proprietary solutions in the corporate segment for too long. As someone else pointed out, value is not directly related to popularity or sales. When you look at the rate of sales in the latest months, there was progress, because of lower price and enthusiast interest in the upcoming OS most likely. They also added 3G to it. iOS and Android were expanding but have now reached some form of maturity. It&rsquo;s a changing market and there&rsquo;s no guarantee, even for the top players, when you look past short term interests and hip.</p>
<p>How well did competing Android tablets sell at the time? The Playbook launched before the iPad 2 was launched, think about that. That was when the iPad was the only worthwhile tablet getting. Apple had mindshare&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite a Bold prediction.</p>
<p>I must carry the Torch for this pun thread.</p>
<p>Getting in on this early, I like to be ahead of the Curve.</p>
<p>A Storm is surely brewing in the mobile industry&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so sad, RIM used to be the Pearl of the mobile industry.</p>
<p>You guys are so great at these puns, you should go on a Tour&hellip;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s their Style</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t like gestures then?</p>
<p>A leak a day over by the boys at RIMM. Is there anything we won&rsquo;t know by 30th jan?</p>
<p>I think they had to do some controlled leaks as otherwise the market would have just destroyed what little value of RIM is left on the stock market&hellip;<br />
However, it certainly does take the wind out of the sails&hellip;</p>
<p>In Canada they are already getting a big push now which is normal I guess due to them being Canadian and having a large background&hellip;still don&rsquo;t think they have a chance here at even approaching Android or iOS but since Microsoft and Nokia don&rsquo;t seem to push Windows phone at all they should easily get 3rd place</p>
<p>oh I 100% appreciate that getting companies like the verge to do free advertising for you through these &lsquo;leaks&rsquo; is very effective. it&rsquo;s a lot cheaper than doing official adverts.. However, perhaps there should have been a better viral marketing effort.. like sticking an advert on youtube, and then dropping that link to the verge.. that would get me excited.. <br />
as stupid as the red miniskirted girl fiasco was with nokia, I could see what they were trying to do.. and let&rsquo;s not lie to ourselves.. they&rsquo;re marketing hype worked.. supply chain issues aside, they&rsquo;re selling as fast as they can make them..<br />
that&rsquo;s where BB needs to be.. and though I am a WP fan, I have no ill will towards bb, a strong, bb is good for everyone.. it brings diversity to phones and help stops the ugly duopoly that is starting to develop between apple and google.</p>
<p>The design looks terribly uninspired. Not that anyone (bar a few) is doing any better.</p>
<p>And the OS is boring with that static grid of icons.</p>
<p>For people who are really into BB I think it&rsquo;s miles ahead of what they have now</p>
<p>I tell you something. BB10 users won&rsquo;t have to care that much about eyecandy on their icon grid, because in contrast to iOS, Android or Windows Phone, BB10 users won&rsquo;t spend much time on their homescreens/app drawers/icon grids because it&rsquo;s neither the center of the user experience nor the OS. They&rsquo;ll spend most of the time within the HUB, the multitasking screen and their 8 most frequently used apps, while the app drawer will be degraded to a staff function. App drawers/icon grids and homescreens with shortcuts and widgets are sooo 2007.</p>
<p>I take it you&rsquo;ve based that assumption on the one image you&rsquo;ve seen of the OS in this leak?</p>
<p>Is there a better way to launch apps? Android has them, iOS has them, and Windows Phone uses a grid instead. The only difference here (bar iOS) is that it doesn&rsquo;t waste your time with other methods of viewing content. The lock screen will hold all your notifications, so why do you need to see them again when you reach the home screen? Whenever you go to the home screen, you see notifications anyways. Your assumption that if the home screen has a grid it must be terribly un-innovative is simply false.</p>
<p>At least we won&rsquo;t be flooded with &ldquo;OMG COME TO VERIZON&rdquo; posts like when the WP8 Nokia phones were unveiled.</p>
<p>Because this a boring phone?</p>
<p>Frankly, it looks 1,000 times more exciting than I thought it would.</p>
<p>Still, RIM has more than twice the number of users here in the U.S. as Microsoft does, per <a href="http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2013/1/comScore_Reports_November_2012_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share">comScore&rsquo;s Nov 2012 data</a>. I would expect more rabble-rousing out of BB peeps.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think their core demographics are techies haha! in the uk for example its a mixture of corporate types who get them (because their IT guys give it to them), and teenagers who get them for their affordability.. not the natural demographic for verge lol.</p>
<p>Most RIM users aren&rsquo;t tech-oriented.  They use their BBs to get stuff done at work, rather than argue over technology.</p>
<p>I remember a particularly amusing debate between an iPhone guy and a BB guy from a few years ago.  The iPhone guy was ribbing his client about &ldquo;still using a BlackBerry&rdquo; and the BB guy said &ldquo;you should be thanking my BlackBerry.  It allows me to get all the work done that allows me to earn the money to pay you so you can have your little toy phone there.&rdquo;  Zinggggg!</p>
<p>True story indeed.</p>
<p><img title="They made your phone in China." src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/11/1334162111818/Mitt-Romney-speaks-during-037.jpg" alt="They made your phone in China." /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a zing. All this I get work done crap is over used. What do you do in a bb that an iPhone or android person can&#8217;t? Same thing with people that say &#8220;surface is for people that want to get real work done&#8221; wtf does that even mean. I have seen iPads at corporations never a surface. Its just smoke and mirrors all these devices do the same thing. It comes down to one thing apps and mind share. When the verge writes about an app its always about android and iOS never hear anything from wp or bb and that&#8217;s where the war is being fought</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really hoping RIM pulls this off.. BlackBerry deserves another chance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that there isn&rsquo;t an ugly Verizon logo on the front.</p>
<p>Different OS optimized for touch input now though.</p>
<p>Still be cautious and all, just don&rsquo;t base expectations on that.</p>
<p>Before  anyone says anything I&rsquo;m an android fan and would only consider this if I can&rsquo;t get a nexus 4 in a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>I feel like people saying that they will get it if they can&rsquo;t get a Nexus 4 is pretty common&hellip;</p>
<p>The.nexus 4 isn&#8217;t even on verizon</p>
<p>All 4 major carriers have said they will carry a phone. I assume RIM will launch this on either T-Mobile or AT&amp;T. Besides, I am not the one who is saying it, others are&hellip;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just suggesting that it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to say if I can&#8217;t get a nexus 4 I will get thus in verizon?</p>
<p>I understand that, but if the Z10 is on T-Mobile (chances are it will), then your suggestion is irrelevant.</p>
<p>This is like an LG Optima with Windows Phone 7 when it first came out on day one. Too much uncertainty, many teething issues, won&rsquo;t be decent until a while away both app content and OS content. Seeing as how the Blackberry 10 is just a mix of things already done in mobile design, it&rsquo;s just another placeholder for something better. I don&rsquo;t see really and actual feature that would make me switch from a Windows Phone 8 to a Blackberry. Maybe the keyboard, but that&rsquo;s like switching from Windows Phone to iphone to use the Do Not Disturb feature.</p>
<p>Going to be one rough shit ride for RIM&hellip;</p>
<p>For me there is no chance to use RIM although as a fellow Canadian I kind of would like to&hellip;<br />
The company I work for switched to iphones a few years back&hellip;I&rsquo;m under the radar with a windows phone 7.5 device but since we use an exchange server, everything works fine for me.  It would be very risky to purchase this and have it not compatible with my work.  There is zero chance my company (10000+) will ever go to BB but we will probably allow windows phone devices this year (I heard they are already testing windows 8 on limited devices).</p>
<p>I think they will do well with some of the installed base with the version that has a keyboard and if a current BB owner needs to upgrade but I don&rsquo;t think many will go for this version outside of the BB fans/tech geeks</p>
<p>For a second I thought when you said &ldquo;under the radar&rdquo; you meant that you had a radar. Was that intentional?</p>
<p>BB10 will connect via EAS/Activesync</p>
<p>In other words, the same way your Windows Phone and other&rsquo;s iPhones do&hellip;</p>
<p>Must be fun to &ldquo;make up things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why would you use wp8? You act like wp8 is this great proven is and bb is a young os. Fact is tho bb has a strong following and will probably most likely stay in third for market share killing off wp in the process</p>
<p>Not very promising to be honest. What I have seen so far from the leaked UI would not make me switch. How can you customize the home screen and let&rsquo;s say pin people, places or bookmarks to it? I haven&rsquo;t seen how this may work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can you customize the home screen and let&rsquo;s say pin people, places or bookmarks to it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe you can, but if you were a buyer who <em>really</em> wanted to do that you&rsquo;d just buy a WP powered device as those are WP unique features.  Similarly, if you were a buyer that <em>really</em> wanted to be able to swipe straight into a hub from anywhere in the OS to be able to see all e-mails, notifications, FB/Twitter updates etc you&rsquo;d be looking for a BB10 device as that is a BB10 unique feature.</p>
<p>Unique features are important for a platform and not all OS should be exactly the same but I don&rsquo;t understand why RIM missed to include those obviously important features. Even iOS gets criticized for the lack of them and Android&rsquo;s success comes for the most part from the ability to do almost everything and Windows Phone&rsquo;s strength is that they simplified this personal customization. I don&rsquo;t see how RIM can be successful here with their new OS.</p>
<p>Just because it doesn&rsquo;t have this doesn&rsquo;t mean that it isn&rsquo;t innovative in other areas. The keyboard, the gestures, the multitasking, the BB Hub, the lock screen, they all look rather interesting.</p>
<p>You <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> customize the homescreen, because <strong>there is no homescreen</strong> in BB10. What you might call a &lsquo;homescreen&rsquo; in BB10 is the multitasking screen. And as it is a <strong>multitasking screen</strong>, it automatically adapts to your user behavior as you start to use it. You&rsquo;re supposed to have always 8 apps up and running, automatically sorted by recency, and those are on the multitasking screen within Active Frames and show dynamic information from the inside like WP Live Tiles. But you don&rsquo;t have to pin them, you don&rsquo;t have to set them up or anything, they&rsquo;re automatically there. So the most frequently used apps will always be there and you don&rsquo;t have to take care of anything, it customizes automatically. That&rsquo;s the entire thing and it&rsquo;s indeed revolutionary, at least for me.</p>
<p>But as for bookmarks, people or places, you&rsquo;ll might be able to pin then to the app drawer.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know if revolutionary but unique for sure. But I&rsquo;m not sure if it makes so much sense. At least for me this wouldn&rsquo;t be very handy because I need to pin content for easy access.</p>
<p>Oh I do honestly think it makes perfect sense. Just take this &lsquo;easy access&rsquo;. WP is supposed to be people-centric. So what do I want to do with people other than communicating? From the BB HUB, which is always one swipe away whereever you are, you can compose and respond to messages of every kind. And you&rsquo;ll also be able to invoke people&rsquo;s contact cards from there, where all their activities are displayed. If you&rsquo;re a heavy Facebook user, the FB app will logically be always there on the multitasking screen you get to with one up-swipe. And of course there&rsquo;s also a universal search. This is the main way I control my legacy BB: I just start typing on the homescreen. Let&rsquo;s say I want to see the contact card of someone or I want to call him, I just type his/her name and there (s)he is within half a second. BB10 will have a global gesture to bring up the keyboard. And I bet you can just bring it up right on the multitasking screen and it automatically starts the universal search, type in and go for it. Not to mention that voice control will be there, too.</p>
<p>BB10 will be all about quick access and getting things done.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of perplexed about the design of the hardware itself. Perhaps it looks different in person, however the front doesn&rsquo;t appear very appealing&hellip;</p>
<p>will this smartphone be government cerified secure as all the previous blackberry unit?this is one big advantage blackberry unit have had for a very llong time,they are government cerified secure.not many can say that if I aint mistaking!</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, it already has been.</p>
<p>BB10 is <a href="http://www1.rim.com/newsroom/press/2012/blackberry-10-receives-fips-security-certification-ahead-of-laun.html">FIPS 140-2 certified</a>.</p>
<p>Teenagers who make about 80% of the target audience don&rsquo;t care about &ldquo;certified secure&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow, you really don&rsquo;t get RIM&rsquo;s business, do you?!?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you people do. Less than 20 or 30 percent of rim blackberry os is business. The rest normal consumers. Rim didn&#8217;t fail because of business. They failed because consumers lost interest. Its only in recent year or two. Business has been switching to android abd ios.</p>
<p>The things teenagers look for in a smartphone are different to those that a BYOD eligible employee might look for, which are different to the things a small business might look for, which are different to the things a large CIO might look for, which are different to the things a government or security conscious organization might look for.  There&rsquo;s no one device to suit them all.</p>
<p>There are many governments/agencies/banks that continue to use BlackBerry precisely <em>because</em> they&rsquo;re certified to whatever level.  I&rsquo;m sure that if other devices had that same level of certification they would have changed by now but the fact is they don&rsquo;t and they haven&rsquo;t, so despite it being a small part of the market, it&rsquo;s still a part that BlackBerry dominate and obviously hope to continue dominating by making their new device as secure as their existing ones.  Just because it <em>is</em> secure shouldn&rsquo;t make it any less appealing to the average consumer or potential teenage buyer.  (The fact it doesn&rsquo;t come in pink or have a LOLCatz Dance Crazy 3000 app will do that just fine)</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you do. RIM had 54% marketshare in the US smartphone market some years ago, but you know what? That was at a time when the smartphone boom hadn&rsquo;t took off. The smartphone market in volume and especially consumer penetration at that time was tiny in contrast to today. RIM was <strong>never</strong> a big deal in the consumer market, they just are <strong>now</strong> and that in certain (undeveloped) markets or in the UK with teenagers. That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like <strong>now</strong>. BBM, low-price devices and affordable dataplans.</p>
<p>But I really want to how you guys can just project RIMs consumer targetgroup of their today&rsquo;s legacy BBOS phones to BB10, as if there was nothing different. That&rsquo;s bullshit. As if RIM would <strong>never</strong> able to sell premium phones in developed markets.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t failed.</p>
<p>Market share has declined but they&rsquo;re profitable still and a valuable company.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how the real world works, do you?</p>
<p>Verizon branding. Top left.</p>
<p>Ugly.</p>
<p>I really have to day that the tiny logo on the top left is by far less ugly than how they handle it on other phones&hellip;</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be there. I am not a fucking billboard.</p>
<p>Agreed, but every device has some sort of branding on it, whether for the OEM, the OS or the carrier.</p>
<p>they really need to just release this thing to the wild at this point</p>
<p>If they can get that Prototype up and running with a 24 hour plus battery life, and what I mean is, a work horse phone that you can punish all day and still go for the 24 hour mark, that my friend, will be a what ever phone killer.  I am tired of having to switch batteries on my android phone or have to carry an extra power cord around to get some power juice. A real phone for people who need to stay connected and make money. Applications that work smooth like butter. Like my old Palm Pilot used to do and still does.</p>
<p>Thank you!!! yes! This!! Take a note you smartphone makers&#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, you lousy smartphone makers, do this! Somehow! It sounds easy enough!</p>
<p>Lemme guess, throwing your hands up in the air and saying it is not possible soo got us to innovate and make better tools&#8230;</p>
<p>Droid RAZR MAXX rooted w/ stock ICS/JB</p>
<p>Is there a root to give it a better screen and less hideous looking?</p>
<p>just take a different route&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t complain about my Samsung Galaxy S 2. That&#8217;s the baseline if I use it only on standby in my pocket:<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/sY20m.png" /></p>
<p>Every use of course substracts from it, but even with heavy, heavy use I get through more than 24h.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of having a phone if you don&#8217;t use it? Today&#8217;s phones barely make through a day if you use them, and that&#8217;s a fact! What you showing is like, my car doesn&#8217;t use any fuel, if I don&#8217;t drive it! Great isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about switching from an android phone?</p>
<p>If Microsoft can get a Windows 8 prototype up and running with a 24 hour plus battery life, and what I mean is, a work horse phone that you can punish all day and still go for the 24 hour mark, that my friend, will be a what ever phone killer.</p>
<p>If Apple can get an iOS 6 prototype up and running with a 24 hour plus battery life, and what I mean is, a work horse phone that you can punish all day and still go for the 24 hour mark, that my friend, will be a what ever phone killer.</p>
<p>If Google&#8230;</p>
<p>Get the idea? Besides, I&#8217;ve looked, and I haven&#8217;t seen anything that indicates there&#8217;s anything special about BB10 that would allow for 24-hour battery life.</p>
<p>Nope, it&#8217;s be worse for RIM is they fucked up the first release of BB10 then to have it be released late.</p>
<p>I sort of meant a &#8220;leak&#8221; because if it&#8217;s interesting it&#8217;ll generate hype for them which will be good.</p>
<p>I bet my Windows Phone 7.5 can smoke that thing</p>
<p>I bet a Nokia 3310 could smoke that thing..</p>
<p>At least RIM still has life in it, which is more than I can say for windows phone 7.</p>
<p>I agree!</p>
<p>what&#8217;s this you call life? cause I can assure you that I can go on with my 7.5 device for a while before I need to get a new device.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but Windows Phone 7 shows a lot of promise, gets great reviews from non tech sites (we are in the minority), and most importantly you can walk into a store and buy one today!  To date RIM has failed for the last several years to execute on even a basic level.  Unless they learned to execute internally, they are the walking dead.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&#8217;re right, WP7, doesn&#8217;t have much life ramining because WP8 is replacing it. But RIM? They&#8217;re a company, an aboselete one too.</p>
<p>The difference is while Blackberry is dying, Windows Phone 7 (soon to be 8) is emerging. Besides, neither Microsoft, nor anyone else are sitting on their asses, waiting for BB10 grass to grow.</p>
<p>Actually, I think you can draw some similarities here. Windows phone was dying, then they release Windows Phone 7 and are on a slow (but sure) climb back up after not releasing anything for a long time. RIM seems to be following that path.</p>
<p>The difference is BB are running out of money</p>
<p>&#8220;RIM has no debt. The company also has more than $2-billion in cash on its balance sheet, and generated $710-million in operating cash flow in its first quarter.&#8221; The Globe and Mail.</p>
<p>Running out of money, really? The company is in by no means good shape but still have a significant presence in countries outside of North America.</p>
<p>Find a graph of their sales and cash flow numbers. They&#8217;re in a steady state of decline. If it breaks $450-million in Q2 I&#8217;d be amazed.</p>
<p>At RIM&#8217;s current rate, they&#8217;re going to be out of cash in 7 months.</p>
<p>With BB 10 pushed out till 2013, they&#8217;re really screwed.</p>
<p>WOAH! Do you really want to do this my friend?</p>
<p>WP8? Which has Microsoft behind it? They&#8217;ll keep pushing it. They can afford to.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m really beginning to like this guy. He&#8217;s using the Eric Schmidt playbook of just saying crazy shit whenever somebody interviews him. If RIM can&#8217;t offer competitive products they will not be out-insaned by Google&#8217;s Executive Chairman.</p>
<p>yeah! and what the hell happened to iOS 4? &#8230;that thing just died on it&#8217;s feet and disappeared!</p>
<p>Windows phone ..please actually windows 95 called and wants it OS back!</p>
<p>Tell me: what does Windows 95 have to do with Windows Phone?</p>
<p>I have to say Windows 95 is more like Android than Windows Phone.. Just saying</p>
<p>Windows 95 IS an OS numb-nuts!</p>
<p>I bet every other Android phone and iOS can smoke your stupid windows phone on various stuff. What&#8217;s with choosing couple of dumb tasks and beating some of the phones by some 1 or 2 sec? And the windows phone store guys already performed that task thousand times and competing against some smartphone noobs?</p>
<p>tell me something that I can&#8217;t do on my device that you can? please do so&#8230; cause I can do just about anything! keep your lagdroid and I will keep my awesome 7.5 device. I am amazed by how dumb many androids fans are. If the only way your platform can look good is by bashing then I am sorry for you guys.</p>
<p>&quot; If the only way your platform can look good is by bashing then I am sorry for you guys.&quot;</p>
<p>If the only way to make your platform look good is by posting comments about it relentlessly in unrelated articles, then I am sorry for you guys.</p>
<p>Are you talking about Android, iOS, or Windows phone users here? Because I see every phone brought up in every post about any phone. You little girls having slap fights over who has the correct preference ruins every comment section on every tech blog.</p>
<p>Well, I can receive and resume Skype calls on my iPhone without having the app in the foreground. You won&#8217;t ever get that on your device, that&#8217;s a fact.</p>
<p>How do you know Microsoft isn&#8217;t going to integrate Skype into 7.8.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe they will. However we all know it&#8217;s coming on Windows 8 devices. Leave them with that boast for the time being. Just like they boasted about Instagram.</p>
<p>since most of us don&#8217;t have FFC, and most people just&#8230; you know&#8230; make calls like normal people, I don&#8217;t really care one way or the other. Skype, great. No Skype, almost as great.</p>
<p>Skype is useful for more than video calls, international calling for example.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a vonage customer so i don&#8217;t neee it.</p>
<p>I can have 10 programs actively running without having them in the foreground on my  blackberry playbook. whoopdeedoo</p>
<p>A more amazing feat would be to have 10 programs running in the foreground. I&#8217;ll buy that mobile product!</p>
<p>I can turn down my media volume without it affecting my ring tone volume!<br />
Plus a a lot more but I thought I would start at the basic things</p>
<p><a href="http://my-symbian.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=44034" target="_blank">http://my-symbian.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=44034</a></p>
<p>121 things  WP7 can not do</p>
<p>I would take WP simplicity over everything. That&#8217;s my personal opinion I rather spend less time on my phone and chat with women rather than customizing my phone at a restaurant.</p>
<p>And this has anything at all to do with this Blackberry article, how?</p>
<p>Negative, Google Now is the future RIM.</p>
<p>The forces that pushed the PC world into one vendor do not exist in the phone world.  We are more likely to see something closer to the gaming world, with 2-3 strong players, perhaps a few minor players, and consumer preferences swaying year to year based on latest products shipped.</p>
<p>2 Strong Players and a couple also rans. Microsoft and Blackberry do not carry the weight needed or have the compelling product to compete.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s looking<br />

<p>We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Richard uses a lot of words to say very little.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so far over&#8230;..</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see any uses for Blackberry? Why buy a Blackberry device?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re so fucked.</p>
<p>Hey you never know&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh for crackpipe.gif&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>In my head all I can think is this will be just a new way of making a phone call, or they&#8217;ll announce some sort of Blackberry themed social network, like Apple&#8217;s music themed Ping and Google&#8217;s search related G+.</p>
<p>Wow, anyone notice the calendar icon? Look familiar?</p>
<p>Also, how much this looks like some early Boot2Gecko prototypes?</p>
<p>Somehow I think &#8220;a new way&#8221; means &#8220;a new way for Blackberry&#8221; and not &#8220;new&#8221; to the industry.</p>
<p>Anything modern is new for Blackberry.</p>
<p>I hear it&#8217;s going to include these new programs that run on blackberry phones, they&#8217;re calling them &#8220;applications&#8221;, or &#8220;apps&#8221; for short. Very cool idea.</p>
<p>Was that bullishness  or bullshit?</p>
<p>Counting down the days until the next flop, excuses and promises that BB11 will be amazing.</p>
<p>Wait&#8230;</p>
<p>It has apps? It can connect to a 3G or 4G network? You can talk, text, AND use data?!</p>
<p>By the gods. RIM has something here.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine working in a management position at RIM when everything around you is falling apart and you can&#8217;t do nothing about it.</p>
<p>more like having the media eat you apart lol</p>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s a good learning experience, if you want to know how to chew your way out of plastic restraints for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lofty stuff, and stuff that&#8217;s hard to take at face value as &quot;</p>
<p>Was expecting/looking forward to a superapps comment.</p>
<p>looks like a cross of symbian and android.</p>
<p>I wish someone could tell me why RIM would wait to bring this out.  I would pay the overtime to the employees to work around the clock to get this device to market for the holiday season.  I hope they understand that NEW windows phone is coming out by the end of the year, New I-phone by end of the year and there is a high chance for a New Galaxy Nexus either by the end of year or the same time that RIM wants to launch this device.  How is this a good strategy for them</p>
<p>&#8220;RIM knows what it&#8217;s doing&#8221;. Ha. That&#8217;s the money quote for this article.</p>
<p>bahahaha, I thought the exact same thing!</p>
<p>.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
RIM. This was 5 years ago and certainly not by your product.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>I like their spirit, though. At least they won&#8217;t go down without a fight.</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s heard RIM&#8217;s latest radio ads or remembers Diplo or those DJ twins talking about wanting &#8220;tools, not toys&#8221; has to know they&#8217;re talking to their current user base, who are larglely clueless when it come to smartphone advancements. People who still believe BES absolutely necessary for secure email and device management.</p>
<p>Sure it will be a whole new way of interacting with the world. For current Blackberry users.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8220;at the beginning of a transition that will change the way people communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will they finally realize that their network is their biggest strategic asset and create their own carrier, with free calls and texts?</p>
<p>RIM needs to play up the conservative authoritarianism a bit more, maybe usher in an era of tried and true vintage tech for the pre jitterbug boomers. Even get Michael Douglas to appear in ads, ditching his gekko Motorola for a Blackberry (plus scotch + leather).</p>
<p>Saying RIM is &#8220;at the beginning of a transition&#8221; is like saying &#8220;I just started crossing this bridge, which is falling apart. And on fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe they should shift some of their money from advertising in Sydney bus shelters and put it into creating Blackberry 10 faster for any chance of survival. But one must scoff at their taglines, &#8220;Fortune favours the bold.&#8221; Well you haven&#8217;t been bold, because fortune definitely doesn&#8217;t favour you.</p>
<p>The only thing Bold about RIMs product is the name.</p>
<p>RIM could have been spending all of this time working on a custom blackberry version of android and could have launched it in time for the holidays. 1 phone&#8230; and boom! they could have had more market share than windows phone.</p>
<p>who would even think of slapping the BlackBerry name on that cheap OS. That just sounds terrible!</p>
<p>&#8230;Why did Josh write this?</p>
<p>Is that picture supposed to be Blackberry 10? It looks like skinned Android.</p>
<p>what if it IS skinned Android? or forked Android?</p>
<p>RIM, meet Palm.</p>
<p>and Nokia, and Microsoft&#8230;</p>
<p>you, sir, may meet the fiery depths of troll hell.</p>
<p>Nokia and Ms will be your daddy soon.</p>
<p>oh mai gawd guys, this phone is so cool.</p>
<p>Attention morons who like robots that eat ice cream and jellybeans , those who value phones that start with a lower case i and are built for retards to feel smart. This is NOT , I repeat NOT a damn phone. It is a developers device that allows you to test and implement applications for the BB10 OS. SMH and the amount of stupidity here , i&#8217;m surprised half of you could even create an account here. Yellow Buss alert we have detected undroid users here !</p>
<p>No /s tag?</p>
<p><img src="http://mobilesyrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/be-bold-infographic.jpeg" /></p>
<p>C&#8217;mon guys, how can you not have hope in Blackberry and the Bold Team?</p>
<p>/sarcasm (just in case)</p>
<p>the heck did i just read?</p>
<p>You actually read the whole thing?</p>
<p>My hobbies also include saving cats.<br />
I put them in small boxes and store them in the basement.</p>
<p>Then do you check your Social Feeds in your spare time?</p>
<p>@catsaver  78 &#8211; a ginger kitten.  Need to buy more boxes.  #catrount</p>
<p>This is what happens when an executive asks their teenage kid who &#8220;knows some of that design stuff&#8221; to draw characters. Bold? Those? Hahaha! Just look at them. If you had to match voices, it wouldn&#8217;t be a confident voice &#8211; it&#8217;d be stereotyped caricatures, weak and wispy.</p>
<p>If Blackberry is still trying to push its &#8220;Amateur hour is over&#8221; idea, this is absolutely not helping. They needed a totally different character style, one with sharper lines and more mature forms. Something more adult, not this childish whimsy. What a way to completely miss the mark!</p>
<p>(assuming this is indeed a genuine campaign&#8230;)</p>
<p>To be honest I don&#8217;t think its a full on campaign, but rather it was only for the New Years Eve event. Heck, maybe it was a way to &#8220;test the waters&#8221; and see the reception of this &#8220;Team&#8221;. Regardless, whoever envisioned this is a compleeeetttteee idiot.</p>
<p>Geez, you only get wat you see at first sight? there is no Bold Team, that was already cleared out back then ha ha ha.</p>
<p>Nice try though</p>
<p>I believe it was for a specific event. I never said it was a full ad campaign. No need to be a dick about it, its just humor and all done in good fun.</p>
<p>Nokia will be fine. They won&#8217;t go down the Microsoft, if Microsoft&#8217;s OS does in fact fail. (which it won&#8217;t) Nokia will start manufacturing Android phones right when their exclusivity with Microsoft ends. I wish all the best for RIM and its employees, its sad they can&#8217;t deliver by the end of the year.</p>
<p>If anyone went to their bb10 jam tour, I think you would see their vision. It&#8217;s so much more than just being a phone and what the phone can do.</p>
<p>Connect Extend Flow<br />
Connect Extend Flow<br />
Connect Extend Flow<br />
Connect Extend Flow</p>
<p>I forgot to add, it&#8217;s whether they can actually pull it off. Their ideas are good however.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of you Undroid users can even afford the Galaxy s3?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering if you know how to spell?</p>
<p><em>ahem, thats OFF</em></p>
<p>im glad you can rookie lol</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry djhankfresh, it&#8217;s been a long day.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s all good , nothing but fun !</p>
<p>At one time, RIM represented the very best user experience in smartphone devices.  That this supposed innovation did not happen 4 years ago to meet the threat of Apple and Google is testament to the company&#8217;s massive corporate arrogance.  With expectations much higher now, with continued innovation by the major players, with a huge exodus of staff for warmer climes and with a fire also lit under Nokia&#8217;s butt, the chance that Blackberrry 10 will indeed be &#8220;an entirely new way of interacting with the world&#8221; is vanishingly small.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ll eat these words in 1Q2013 when Blackberry 10 produces even as much as a 5% change in market share during that year.</p>
<blockquote>BlackBerry 10 is &#8216;an entirely new way of interacting with the world around us&#8217;</blockquote>
<p>It well better freakin&#8217; be if RIM hopes to re-capture <em><strong>any</strong></em> segment of the market.</p>
<p>&#8230;and it better come to market before everyone moves on to quantum computing /s</p>
<p>I just have a gut feeling this won&#8217;t make it to market. Hope I&#8217;m wrong as my wife is a big fan of their phones although that may change if they go touch screen only. They are bleeding money and losing market share very quickly. It&#8217;s sad because competition is good.</p>
<p>The first BB10 device will be full touch but of course there will be one with an excellent keyboard as de 9900</p>
<p>Every vague platitude just makes it more clear that they don&#8217;t have anything concrete.</p>

<p>Thorstein being in denial and this ? They sure try really hard to make people feel unsympathetic to them.</p>
<p>Normally I&#8217;d agree with them and say that they need to not release anything before it&#8217;s ready, but at this point people are going to forget about them by the time BB10 is out.</p>
<p>Nokia will knock them out by years end.</p>
<p>Interacting with the world? What world? There will be NO WORLD IN 2013!</p>
<p>Man I almost forgot about that&#8230;</p>
<p>Ah damn&#8230; I was waiting for that E3 2013&#8230; /:</p>
<p>&#8220;yawn&#8221; Whatever phone or ecosystem you have bought into, why slam BlackBerry before BB10 is even out. Dont forget, that without RIM and Palm, which invented 80+% of what a smartphone is now capable of.  I know that the vitriol is burning like acid to get out whenever a phone that&#8217;s not your favourite toy is in a story but until BB10 is released, just relax.</p>
<p>Quite often when I read these post it feels like been trapped on a bus full of school children shouting from their cliques across the bus &#8220;my dads can beat up your dad&#8221;.</p>
<p>amen</p>
<p>&#8230; that no one no longer cares about!</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll probably surprise everyone with some sort of retro design.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1075.photobucket.com/albums/w437/northernroamer/500x_012.jpg" target="_blank">http://i1075.photobucket.com/albums/w437/northernroamer/500x_012.jpg</a></p>
<p>My guess is they will double down and go with mechanical hammer-action typewriter keys. (&#8220;Feel that solid &#8216;thunk&#8217; of quality? They&#8217;re even loud so everyone around you will know you&#8217;re getting tons of work done!&#8221;)</p>
<p>With iPhone people leaned about Smart Phone Design and Hardware.<br />
Next: <br />
With Google they learned about competition and Freedom.<br />
With WP they learned about differentiation and Integration<br />
With BB, FaceBook OS,  MeeGo, Mozilla OS &#8230; they will learn about Services and NON-Platform-Dependent Integrated Services.<br />
BB, MeeGo&#8230; will not stop fighting and people will learn that Games are not platform dependent. They will learn that a Twitter &amp; Facebook App can run on multiple Platforms.<br />
They will learn that an SmartPhone OS means nothing and with a little regulation even Hardware will mean nothing in a world where you will be able to install latest Android on iPhone withhold losing Warranty&#8230;</p>
<p>GTFO RIM</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s PR is reminding me more and more of Comical Ali from the Iraq Invasion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27Oq5ot0ZI" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s27Oq5ot0ZI</a></p>
<p>So.. what happened to BB8 and BB9?</p>
<p>Exactly. </p>
<p>That would make too much sense.</p>
<p>They picked BB10 because 7 8 9! DUH!</p>
<p>Oh my god</p>
<p>to be fair Apple went from QuickTime 7 to X (10) with no 8 or 9.</p>
<p>Though Apple did have an OS-X, which genuinely was the 10th, and the various -X versions of their apps were generally the first native OS-X cocoa versions.</p>
<p>Ehh, was it really the tenth?</p>
<p>System 7.5 and Mac OS 8.5 were actually pretty major in changes.</p>
<p>Numbering is all a bunch of bullshit anyways.</p>
<p>Well the predecessor was System 9, so it wasn&#8217;t just a random desire for an X :)</p>
<p>What Roman numeral is X?</p>
<p>At this point one has to seriously ask &#8211; who is it sticking pins in the RIM voodoo doll?</p>
<p>I heard they&#8217;re planning to hire a third CEO to investigate that problem</p>
<p>They should hire the guy doing the pin sticking. He has some serious mojo.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s ridiculous. Everyone know 1 CEO is not enough and 3 is too much.</p>
<p>Just like tits and martinis&#8230;</p>
<p>Besides me? :)</p>
<p>How about BBOSX  ..oh wait</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t they named it Blackberry X? It sounds more youthful, more &#8220;in the scene&#8221;, more extreme; that surely will attract the young uns!</p>
<p>Bl4ckB3ry 3Xtr3m3!</p>
<p>What if they just completely got rid of the BlackBerry name and called the next generation devices something else like Xberry or something. I don&#8217;t know but I think most people will just automatically think of old smartphones with keyboards and a nice email app when they hear BlackBerry. They should just hire a third and fourth CEO while they&#8217;re at it.</p>
<p>Well, Frank, I guess you could say that for this lawsuit&#8230;they found BASIS.</p>
<p>I almost feel sorry for RIM, almost.</p>
<p>they can&#8217;t a break.</p>
<p>catch a break</p>
<p>RIM must wonder when the bad news is going to end.</p>
<blockquote>you would probably make sure you chose one that wouldn&#8217;t become the target of a lawsuit that could require you to change the name</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/10/cisco-sues-apple-for-trademark-infringement-ruh-roh/">Who bothers checking on such things&#8230;</a></p>
<p>thank you for that link, they also had to license iOS from Cisco but they were successful in that.</p>
<p>Yep, and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/28/apple-and-fujitsu-inevitably-caught-up-in-ipad-trademark-dispute/">there was an issue for the iPad name with Fujitsu and some other company as well</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I would say that Apple doesn&#8217;t check on those things, but that they don&#8217;t care. They&#8217;re willing to spend the money needed to either buy or license the names. Whereas, RIM just lost their new name since they don&#8217;t have the money to make things happen in their favour.</p>
<p>No money should = more thought and care, but then again, it&#8217;s usually the lack of thought and care that leads to no money.. so hmmm&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>Hmm, Blackberry 10. Blackberry X. BlackBerry X. BlackBerryX. B&#8230;B&#8230;.X. Look what we have here &#8230; BBX. Amazing coincidence, not.</p>
<p>Blackberry X would have been better.</p>
<p>It really doesn&#8217;t matter in the slightest. <br />
No technology name could be worse than Bluetooth and still that thing is still a success, despite the worst tech name in history.<br />
:)</p>
<p>Blackberry 10 is fine.</p>
<p>call it what you want &#8211; I cant see it stopping the ship from sinking&#8230;.</p>
<p>BBX or BlackBerry 10.  Makes no difference to me.  I&#8217;m looking forward to a QWERTY BB10 phone.</p>
<p>It is so nice to see someone who still cares about the old BB keyboard on this forum. You poor soul.</p>
<p>Touhscreen only does nothing for me.  A hardware keyboard will always be a part of my phone and preferably in the standard BB form factor.</p>
<p>Until they burn through the rest of their cash and go chapter 11.</p>
<p>DVP for the win! I had a BB w/querty, but when it broke I couldn&#8217;t afford to replace it, as I bought it subsidized for $8 lol.  Great alternative for about half the price of a Torch :)</p>
<p>OMG Just use QNX O_O. It&#8217;s a well-known name for stability, performance, and business-critical operations.</p>
<p>and it rings better &#8220;Kyuuu Ennn Exxx&#8221; not &#8220;Be Be ECKS&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sounds like a bunch of drunk BB execs on a plane thought this one up.</p>
<p>Maybe they should call it BNB for Bad News Bear os. <br />
Jeez these guys have less good news than a crack head with poor judgement.</p>
<p>The leadership that&#8217;s going on at RIM is breathtaking. Breathtakingly horrible. At first I thought RIM&#8217;s troubles were just a combination of bad luck and negative press. Then I got all Mel Gibson Conspiracy Theory about it, convinced there were forces outside the  company acively trying to bring them down.</p>
<p>My next phase was to get very angry with Lararidis and Balsille, and blame it all on their dysfunctional leadership. But having exhausted all rational possibilities, I have arrived at the irrational yet convincing argument that at this point Laz and Bals are lining the company up for a takeover.</p>
<p>Please pardon any spelling or grammatical errors. I typed this on a Playbook, which has no spell-check functionality and a very finicky keyboard. Yeah, and like an idiot I paid full price for it judt before the markdowns.</p>
<p>Buyer&#8217;s remorse!  noooooooo</p>
<p>Better to have buyer&#8217;s remorse than this:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization</a></p>
<p>People with that problem only post on Engadget!</p>
<p>BBX was cool.<br />
Blackberry 10 is lame.<br />
Blackberry X would be good.</p>
<p>They really should have just stuck with QNX though but they are trying to have branding in it&#8230; which is natural&#8230; maybe BB-QNX (lol) I guess they couldn&#8217;t go with BBq because the roasting, flaming and cookout jokes would never end&#8230;</p>
<p>WhackBerry. No need for numbers yet, as a brand new fail train has left the station&#8230;</p>
<p>And I was a loyal BB user not long ago, but it&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re trying to screw this up.</p>
<p>HTC&#8230; just do it!</p>
<p>A better idea would be RIM making stock android phones and be the only android vendor with bbm.</p>
<p>and pay $ to microsoft.no thanks.</p>
<p>That would be awesome! I&#8217;m sick of carrying my personal phone and the company blackberry.</p>
<p>A better Idea would be to Add support to the BBOS For Android Apps so they can keep the reason people stay and Get the reason people leave&#8230;..</p>
<p>Oh Wait. They already messed up that idea too.</p>
<p>That exclusivity won&#8217;t last long.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually a brilliant idea. And RIM has enough of a clout to force Verizon and AT&amp;T into accepting stock Android devices</p>
<p>No it wouldn&#8217;t. BBM would be rooted onto every phone out there&#8230;</p>
<p>Please no.</p>
<p>And become just another Android vendor? One that is already behind. Why?</p>
<p>Is this suppose to be a joke?</p>
<p>failing to see the correlation between BB and &#8220;another fruit company&#8221;</p>
<p>They both produce their own hard- and software. But that&#8217;s about it I guess.. :P</p>
<p>Apple and BlackBerry both put their own OS on their own hardware.  Not sure if you&#8217;re just trolling though.</p>
<p>comparison, not correlation.</p>
<p>yes of course, sorry.  been a long day lol how&#8217;d i make that mistake?!</p>
<p>you don&#8217;t do it right either, judging by what you know of cydia sigh.</p>
<p>I see it., android originally wanted to copy blackberry but after apple release iphone they decided to copy apple instead.</p>
<p>Our strategy in the past four years was a giant flop but we are inclined to continue along these lines as we feel fine about it. We deliver one shitty handset after another and cannot care less. You expect decent handsets from us but we are feeling like giving you and outlandishly stupid tablet instead. We lost our core market &#8211; corporate US &#8211; and feel just marvelous, in fact we feel like on top of the world.</p>
<p>And, by the way, you can license our new OS from us when it&#8217;s out. Make your pre-orders.</p>
<p>Hmmm. Ok.</p>
<p>On the Contrary, Thier Newest Phones have been Very Well made, if a little thick. <br />
If RIM can supply with BBX A well made, Qwerty Bar with a ~large screen  (w/ touch of course), an app platform that is At windows phone&#8217;s level, and an OS as secure as the one they have now. I would definatly think about getting one. But im the one percent who actually like keyboards.</p>
<p>RIM continues to circle the drain.</p>
<p>saying &#8220;its actually making me depressed now to watch them continue to tread water in a weighted vest&#8221; so often is making me even more depressed. i am certainly not a RIMM fan, but I can acknowledge all they have done. its amazing that we are witnessing this downfall first hand.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;s really really difficult to turn the momentum around once you&#8217;ve started diving downward hard. Palm had a very solid iOS competitor much earlier than RIM and still failed to survive. Microsoft is literally throwing money at Windows Phone 7 and coereced Android makers to pay fees, and yet Windows Phone 7 is still struggling.</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s new OS will be on the market later than those and RIM doesn&#8217;t have the endless money pit like Microsoft does either. I just don&#8217;t see how RIM can survive in the long run unless they can come up with something really different.</p>
<p>T. Heins said "I don’t think there is a drastic change needed", that sums it up. This guy has been co-head of RIM&#8217;s daily operations for four years now. I know he needs to give props to the founders of the company, but it appears that he has not a clue. This is not a change for RIM, not a new direction &#8230; by the sounds of it they will throw money at the problem and let their marketing department drain what little cash the company has left.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t dramatically change direction. They don&#8217;t have the luxury of time of funds any more. Saying that they will do exactly the same thing they&#8217;ve been doing for the past couple of years and just spend more on marketing while having grandiose delusions about being Apple &#8230; denial.</p>
<p>That said, I think RIM will be acquired this year. If they don&#8217;t sell, they will be acquired next year for a lot less.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, it would have been a more intriguing move to have put various pieces of the Blackberry USP out there.<br />
No matter what RIM comes up with for 10, they cannot hope to dominate again; to even stand a remote chance, they would have to dump the very things that made them unique in the first place (eg their own servers).</p>
<p>Another fruit company? The difference between Blackberry and Apple is one is successful. I wonder which one?</p>
<p>Note to RIM: Your hardware was is not the problem.  Perhaps you should be open to licensing your hardware division.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s a myth. Hardware has absolutely been a major problem with RIM. Blackberrys have very nice keyboards and in general solidly made with good reception. But in the modern era, smartphone is propelled by the quality of display, the speed of processor and how appealing and thin the industrial design is. RIM hasn&#8217;t done well in any of those.</p>
<p>The hardware is the problem as is the software. No one gives a damn about physical keyboards. If RIM attempts to licensing the OS they&#8217;re already dead. Who&#8217;s going to pay for it? Both Android and WebOS are free.</p>
<p>RIM has no way out. They&#8217;re worth far less than their market cap.</p>
<p>I remember John and Steve saying almost the same thing about webOS, right before Leo tried to kill the entire project.</p>
<p>*cough*palm*cough*</p>
<p>wow.. tough break.</p>
<p>wow.. tough break.I have no idea how RIM thinks they can wait until the end of 2012 and have any hope of launching a new mobile OS. Microsoft&#8217;s having a tough enough time trying to get windows phone some traction&#8230; and they&#8217;ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars marketing it over the last year and a half or so.</p>
<p>wow.. tough break.I have no idea how RIM thinks they can wait until the end of 2012 and have any hope of launching a new mobile OS. Microsoft&#8217;s having a tough enough time trying to get windows phone some traction&#8230; and they&#8217;ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars marketing it over the last year and a half or so.Aside from pulling an Amazon and forking Android, what can RIM really do here?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.adinnerguest.com/wp-content/uploads/crackberry.jpg" /></p>
<p>Remember when that <em>&#8220;other fruit company&#8221;</em> was so far down the drain that they started to license their operating system to other hardware makers? <br />
The clones that were made failed horribly, and RIM does not have their own &#8220;Steve Jobs&#8221; waiting to swoop in and save them.</p>
<p>History repeating itself yet again.</p>
<p>I wonder if Microsoft will be waiting with $150M bailout this time&#8230; perhaps with a copy of Windows Phone? Or whether they&#8217;ll just let them die after watching the new Apple surpass them?</p>
<p>The problem with the buyout is that there&#8217;s literally nothing to buy. They have no modern technology. They destroyed their user base and the remaining customers will flee right after the buyout so this is not a factor too. They have some real estate, maybe plants, and well&#8230; some patents. Cannot expect to get much for that.</p>
<p>Probably that&#8217;s why they are trying to make an impression they have something great coming soon. Or they are just clueless that&#8217;s also possible.</p>
<p>If Motorola was worth 12.5m for patents, this is worth a lot more on that basis</p>
<p>Oh, no, dear sir. Motorola would not worth that much if it had no way to grab Google by the balls and literally blackmail it. How would RIM pull this trick?</p>
<p>they&#8217;ll let blackberry die.  MS needed another large OS company to keep MS out of Monopoly suits.  On the smartphones there&#8217;s already apple and android.</p>
<p>If they were open to licencing parts of the Blackberry platform, like BBM or e-mail delivery, this might be kinda sorta interesting. I don&#8217;t see what any company like HTC has to gain by paying for this out-of-date OS. If you&#8217;re going to pay, might as well go with WP7.</p>
<p>Can we expect the same ..from Apple or Google 10 years from now ?</p>
<p>you&#8217;ll never know.</p>
<p>5 years. Unless Cook is willing to Throw away what Jobs had planned. <br />
IM not saying Jobs wasnt an amazing inventor, But he himself said that you cant give people what they want. You have to give them what they dont know they want yet.  Only Cook, Forestal, and Ives can do that now. Honestly, i would love to have Cook return to the COO position and let Forstal Take over. If anyone is the next Steve Jobs ,Its him. Or Steven Synosky In the Windows Dept. I havnt decided yet.</p>
<p>Easy there, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprockets_(Saturday_Night_Live)">Dieter</a>. You need to release the damn thing before you start wondering about licensing it to other manufacturers.</p>
<p>They say that as though manufacturers would WANT their software.</p>
<p>This is going to hurt.</p>
<p>Should be:</p>
<p>RIM is open to licensing Android, last ditch attempt at saving the sinking ship, confirms Captain Birdseye, new CEO</p>
<p>It seems one of the new steps along the path for a dying mobile OS is to offer to license it to others. When nobody else is stupid enough to walk the gang plank onto your Titanic, the final step is to open source the OS.</p>
<p>who wants that crap?</p>
<p>The way I see it, the only way RIM can save themselves now is by putting Windows Phone software on their phone. It&#8217;d give them a renewed appeal to their business and executive customers, and help them rise again by piggybacking off of any potential success Windows Phone has.</p>
<p>With Microsoft&#8217;s track record for splashing the advertising cash too, they could start to turn around the reputation they&#8217;ve garnered for poor software on generally good hardware.</p>
<p>No, Blackberries entire existence revolves around their security.  MS has a reputation for being insecure and always under attack from virii, whether this reputation is deserved or not, is another story.</p>
<p>Windows Phone&#8217;s walled ecosystem lends itself to security. Most businesses also run Windows. Built-in Office suite with BlackBerry keyboard could be a real killer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;d be an easy thing to sell in my opinion.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know wp7 was selling</p>
<p>The only way I can see Blackberry coming out of this is coming out with something completely new.  And not just another attempt at Blackberry OS-  most likely it would need to be a partnership.   Something I could see working would be if they brought BBM and BB email services to windows phone or android as a special phone.  I&#8217;m wondering if they could partner with both Nokia and Microsoft to make a Nokia Blackberry Windows phone?  That could be intriguing.</p>
<p>This is exactly what they should&#8217;ve done in the first place! before even thinking to compete with Apple in a way they didn&#8217;t stand a chance. Perhaps if they play their cards right, this ought be the move that takes them near the top again, not in the selling phones field, but selling Cloud Services.<br />
I wouldn&#8217;t license the OS itself, but the cloud tools. Like having a Blackberry Messenger App in the iTunes App Store or a Blackberry Mail experience App in the Android Store.</p>
<p>Similar to what&#8217;s already been said, but my $0.02:  Sell (or just kill) the hardware business and focus on cross platform messaging and mobile device management.</p>
<p>Why pay for a webOS ripoff BB10 when webOS is now free?</p>
<p>Would you buy this WP7 BlackBerry? :) (Quick PS made by myself)</p>
<p><a href="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/4028/wp7bb.jpg" target="_blank">http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/4028/wp7bb.jpg</a></p>
<p><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/4028/wp7bb.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not a chance. Though I think a solid keyboard should give WP7 a big shout in the enterprise space with their office suite.</p>
<p>Plus, honestly, all their Win8 tabs better have good stylus support. For years I&#8217;ve dreamed of a good tablet with a stylus and OneNote on it</p>
<p>I like the form factor somewhat, but I rather prefer a screen that&#8217;s flush with the body.</p>
<p>&#8230;this is a dev unit</p>
<p>I would hope so. It looks like a brick.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve inadvertently guessed the big secret.  It&#8217;s made by Panasonic and is part of their Toughbook line.  Yup, it&#8217;s the only smart-phone in the world you can beat someone to death with and tweet their abbreviated obituary before the body gets to cooling.  The chasis is 18/10 stainless, the screen is palladium based metallic glass and the outer coating is nextel because we all know stone cold types are way into into suede and the folks at RIMM aren&#8217;t about to argue with them.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what that phone looks like or does, I&#8217;ll be getting it no matter what after seeing this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlsahuZ_4oM&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlsahuZ_4oM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>WOW</p>
<p>Oh my god hahaha as much as I despise them, this is brilliant!</p>
<p>EPIC</p>
<p>Well just take my money now</p>
<p>This is so wrong, <strong>so wrong</strong></p>
<p>And feels so right!</p>
<p>It sounds like they really value their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE">developers, developers, developers, developers</a>.</p>
<p>FULL OF WIN!</p>
<p>Baby should be replaced with &#8216;Jesus&#8217; &#169; Southpark</p>
<p>They should have made Thorsten Heins the lead singer in the video.</p>
<p>Looks like like BB10 is so awesome even Steve Jobs is all for it. See he is on the guitar!</p>
<p>wh<br />
whaaatt</p>
<p>my ghod who thought that was a good idea</p>
<p>I just threw up</p>
<p>RTFA for crying out loud.</p>
<p>My bad, I missed a paragraph.</p>
<p>Replace that plastic with bamboo and it would make an interesting device.</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>as much as im itching for a lumia 920, this looks VERY impressive!! Competition is going to get really hot from now on</p>
<p>What&#8217;s impressive about this?</p>
<p>All messages in one place (?), the keyboard (?)</p>
<p>grasping at straws&#8230;</p>
<p>Windows Phone already does the unified messaging. Touch keyboard will have to be tried before I can comment though.</p>
<p>I have a PB and am pulling for RIM to stay in the game&#8230;but I don&#8217;t &#8216;get&#8217; the wonder of this unified inbox&#8230;seems I&#8217;ve had that on my Xperia since day one &#8230;</p>
<p>I love the unified inbox on my BlackBerry 9650 (I have been waiting for BB10 for a loooooong time). It is very, very, very, convenient to have everything (messages and notifications) in one place and be able to act on them from there.</p>
<p>I always thought it were &#8216;linked&#8217; inboxes on BB and not &#8216;unified&#8217; like on wp7?</p>
<p>-Flow UI<br />
-Peek<br />
-Speed<br />
-Hardware and Software made in house together (there&#8217;s a reason the iPhone is so smooth and doesn&#8217;t need the fastest hardware)<br />
-Keyboard seems like it&#8217;ll make typing faster with its predictive typing (I&#8217;ve obviously never used it though)</p>
<p>What more did you want out of this? A&#8230;..companion?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t even final hardware/software and it&#8217;s fucking awesome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meh..   RIM needed a &#8220;Holy Shit&#8221; moment with BB10 and didn&#8217;t deliver. I just don&#8217;t seeing this going anywhere.</p>
<p>What was the &#8220;holy shit&#8221; moment for ios6, wp8 or android 4.1?<br />
Smartphones do so much already, I don&#8217;t see any revolution happening anytime soon</p>
<p>Well I can&#8217;t speak for ios/android, but just the look and uniqueness of Windows Phone was a holy shit moment for me.  The way it integrates with Xbox /Skydrive / facebook / twitter is also very nice. Not to mention what goodies await us once wp8/win8 are announced 10/25 :)</p>
<p>Bingo. I&#8217;ve done iOS  and Android, but I use Windows all day at work and XBox at night.</p>
<p>I have a touchpad with CM9 and it&#8217;s nice, but I think it would be <em>really </em>nice to have all of my devices finally able to play nice together, out of the box.</p>
<p>Nokia 920 with a surface pro tab (with LTE? yes please!) and I&#8217;ll be one happy boy.</p>
<p>I see your Windows bias is showing, most people didn&#8217;t like the uniqueness  of wp7, in terms of looks wp8 just adds different tile sizes.<br />
It&#8217;s ok if wp8 appeals to you, but the design was not a &#8220;holy shit&#8221; moment considering we already saw wp7, in fact for most people wp7 was a &#8220;hmmm&#8221; moment seeing as most people didn&#8217;t know what to think about it.<br />
None of the other features you mentioned falls under that category either, facebook and twitter integration has been done before, as is cloud storage integration. Xbox integration I don&#8217;t think that would be a selling point. I wouldn&#8217;t buy a phone just because it has xbox integration. The best thing wp8 has going for it, is the inclusion of Nokia Maps.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, Facebook and Twitter integration HAD been done before&#8230;</p>
<p>..by WP7.</p>
<p>Unique colored tiles  = meh<br />
Unique tiles with logo&#8217;s = holy shit moment?</p>
<p>Ok. Sure.</p>
<p>And good job avoiding the question of integrated ecosystems and app market by focusing on the subjectivity of individual tastes.  Though in your defense, you weren&#8217; t the one to cite design in the first place.</p>
<p>For the most part, iOS and Android don&#8217;t need any more &#8220;holy shit&#8221; moments. They&#8217;ve already proven themselves. It&#8217;s WP8 and RIM that need it in order to get some traction. There is no compelling reason to buy one otherwise, when you can get a similar iOS or Android device with much better app support and a proven track record.</p>
<p>The holy shit moment was their inception.</p>
<p>This OS is a disappointment.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait and see I suppose. They haven&#8217;t even shown us hardware yet and you&#8217;re already writing them off.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying this is game changing. I don&#8217;t really think it is. I do however think this is a solid progression over the competition is all and I do feel all this new UI and speed throughout it is what mobile needs to become.</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m not impressed yet. I do, however, see reason to think that they may yet pull out of the nosedive. They&#8217;ve been the butt of soooo much hate and ridicule on the nerd forums like these that it&#8217;s sometimes hard to remember that the VAST majority of consumers and business folk just don&#8217;t care about what &#8220;we&#8221; think.</p>
<p>Anyway, I honestly don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll ever really recover, but with some solid products they may be able to hang on and stay in business.</p>
<p>it does look very fast, and it will probably do all the basics that a &#8220;business user&#8221; will expect out of their phone (from RIM&#8217;s perspective) but without any real app ecosystem out of the gate RIM is looking at at least 2-3 years of dead last place in phone shipments, mind share, and application development. I really dont think they have enough cash on hand OR enough patents to license out to survive the time it would take even if this is a perfect OS launch simply because of the lack of development buzz.</p>
<p>For one thing the QNX multitasks like a beast.  All they really need to worry about is app support as the OS is looking pretty good.</p>
<p>it looks fancy and you do swipey thing?</p>
<p>Rim has ripped off almost all the OSes in the market. Some WP animations, tile syle, Nokia&#8217;s meego swipe-UI style. Am sure, will have something from Android and iOS also. Infact their dev hardware also looks like Nokia N9 and Lumias shape-wise.</p>
<p>The fact that you think the dev hardware looks like Nokia N9 and the Lumias goes to show how lousy Nokia designers are. Those are mere boxes and absolutely no designers spent time on making it beautiful. Its just a black box with glass on top.</p>
<p>RIM is to Apple/Google/MS what MySpace is to Facebook/Twitter/G+.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way back from here!</p>
<p>Questionable inclusion of G+ in that analogy, but your point is (otherwise) solid.</p>
<p>Why? Because you don&#8217;t like it?</p>
<p>Mind-share is probably the appropriate word. Ask random people on the street if they know Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus. I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll hear &#8220;I&#8217;m on it, I know it, and Google what?&#8221;</p>
<p>But why am I asking random people on the street when I could ask my Google Plus circles? :)</p>
<p>Google+ does not have the social penetration of Facebook and Twitter, despite the number of people they have signed up. Google has done a great job of roping people into the service by connecting it so closely to their search product (and all their other products) after their major redesign, but engagement is a different matter. Let&#8217;s not forget: lots of people still have blackberries too. But we don&#8217;t care how many blackberries have already been sold; we care how many will continue to be sold, and how many are being actively used.</p>
<p>Yeah I have 2 Google+ profiles now, just because I created a new Youtube account the other day.</p>
<p>Uh, good for you? This doesn&#8217;t speak to the general population&#8217;s relative engagement with G+, as compared to Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>In my eyes, Windows Phone 8 and Google+ are both coming third :D!</p>
<p>Have you seen the new MySpace? I&#8217;m seeing a comeback. I&#8217;m not saying RIM will come back, but the new MySpace looks awesome.</p>
<p>I disagree, Apple was the same to Microsoft 15 years ago and look at it now. It&#8217;s not over until rim is for sale or something like that. Bb10 looks promising and lets not forget that rim owns enterprise. Ios and android don&#8217;t play as nicely with cto&#8217;s. Full disclosure I&#8217;m hardcore android.</p>
<p>It looks interesting. A new interaction model for mobiles, using gestures a lot more than the big three do (iPhone, Android, Windows Phone). It could work. Their implementation of &#8216;notification centre&#8217; looks very innovative.</p>
<p>Interested to see what comes next for this. Q1 2013 will be <em>very</em> interesting.</p>
<p>Gesture is quite a bit of copy and inspired from Nokia&#8217;s N9 Meego swipe-UI.</p>
<p>BB10 doesn&#8217;t use similar gestures. Meego didn&#8217;t invent gestures. BOOM!</p>
<p>Jeeze there&#8217;s a ton of haters on here.</p>
<p>This looks fucking awesome. What more could you ask out of a phone? The entire OS looks like it&#8217;s all about speed and getting shit done. Not all of us only use our phones to play games you know?</p>
<p>The demo reminds me of the Pre &#8211; the gestures, the unified messaging. If they re-made the pre with decent internals, I would jump all over it.</p>
<p>I actually love the developer&#8217;s form factor; falls right in line with Thinkpad styling. I use my phone for work and personal use so being able to switch is pretty awesome too &#8211; I&#8217;ve had to carry two phones in the past.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t try to get in front of the hate train, just step aside and let it steam on.</p>
<p>I wonder if they&#8217;ll be able to get a reasonable amount of sales to the corporate market if they can develop it for a corporate IT environment. They should understand that segment pretty well, but I suspect they&#8217;re mostly using iPhones now.</p>
<p>It looks like they fell right in between WP, Android and iOS.  Most importantly, it doesn&#8217;t look bad.  Good for them.</p>
<p>Pretty much so 2011. Just throw everything together. iOS, Symbian, Android, WP, webOS.<br />
RIM, seriously? Is it really your magic potion?</p>
<p>It looks like a square Lumia 900.</p>
<p>Man I can&#8217;t wait till you guys start recording these videos using the Lumia 920 cause this is shaky as frack.</p>
<p>You do realize any high-end point and shoot or DSLR has the same type of OIS tech that Lumia 920 has, don&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s special for Lumia 920 because it&#8217;s the first <strong>phone</strong> to have it, bot because it&#8217;s the first device ever to have  that technology. Even Samsung&#8217;s Jelly Bean Galaxy Camera has OIS.</p>
<p>So if Samsung already has it, how is the 920 the first <strong>phone</strong> with it, given the fact that the 920 isn&#8217;t even available yet?</p>
<p>Read carefully, he&#8217;s talking about the Galaxy Camera, which is not a phone.</p>
<p>Their naming scheme is getting ridiculous&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, I realize this.. just being a fanboy for my next phone :P</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a believer that the best camera you have is the one you have on you at the moment.  Looking forward to improvements in smartphone camera tech and the lumia 920 pureview is the current cream of the crop so far.</p>
<p>I really like the messaging hub idea. Google should do this at lest for all their different messaging apps, if not for all messaging apps.</p>
<p>I want to see a password protected lockscreen, and also getting quickly to the camera from said screen.</p>
<p>There is no microSD slot on the original Dev Alpha.</p>
<p>This looks a lot like Meego</p>
<p>Completely agree. Quite a rip-off. Lot of people here have forgotten Meego or not seen it.</p>
<p>Looks fine but nothing amazing and Blackberry need something amazing especially as Windows Phone 8 is going to be awesome and popular.</p>
<p>I stopped reading after the wall of icons.  Apple&#8217;s going to go after them for patent infringement.</p>
<p>Apple wouldn&#8217;t touch RIM for that as many many devices have had a grid of icons for decades. RIMs first true BlackBerry had it in 2001/2002 thats why Apple wont go there.</p>
<p>Active Frames. &#8220;They&#8217;re not Live Tiles&#8221;. lol&#8230;sound familiar?</p>
<p>Am I the only one that thinks that looks like a shitty Android phone?? No hate just sayin.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to note, many preproduction phones have a chassis like this one to keep final design a secret and to be able to test devices in the open. I&#8217;ve seen a Galaxy S3 that looked like this during a meeting with Samsung representative at work.</p>
<p><img src="http://cdn.uberphones.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Nokia-Belle.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>HHAHhahahaha </strong>they changed the design as they knew that iPhone shaped clone they had out before would bring them more losses than gains. Now it&#8217;s uglier, the iPhone shaped device looked better.</p>
<p>At 1:53 you can see a flashing LED, so BB users rejoice, the blinking LED is baaaaack!</p>
<p>It never went away.</p>
<p>If they can put in a few little features like this that no one else has they might just pull this off.</p>
<p>Flashing LED, hmm&#8230; No one has it. Really? <br />
Nokia has had it in their Symbian phones, HTC has it in their WP phones and many others also have had it.</p>
<p>Good luck with that, RIM.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d actually buy that boxy dev unit and use it on everyday. It looks great, edges could cut which is a plus. But the thing is, I know only 4 people that use BB.</p>
<p>i think you only know 4 people, and they all use BB</p>

<p>While I understand the reasoning (current BB&#8217;s are crap and can&#8217;t exactly upgrade to a <strong>potentially</strong> better OS), it&#8217;s still a big blow. That means they&#8217;ll need to try and convert everyone to their new BB10, or try and get new customers. Tough Sell, with everyone leaving RIM.</p>
<p>Selling products today that are software dead ends.. well I don&#8217;t see RIM have much of a choice. But they could take the sting out some by offering some form of credit/trade in programme. I know that is complicated with subsidised handsets sold via carriers but that&#8217;s RIM&#8217;s problem to solve. And they can solve it if their really do value their customers. Of course, conceding profit will be difficult in their current financial position but that&#8217;s got to be better than alienating what few loyal customers they have left.</p>
<p>Actually RIM already has a trade-in program: <a href="https://tradeup.blackberry.com/en/us/web/home.html" target="_blank">https://tradeup.blackberry.com/en/us/web/home.html</a></p>
<p>Cheers, I did not know this. In that case, great,they should consider leveraging this come the revolution. Or the launch of BB10 handsets. Whichever comes soonest.</p>
<p>Are we allowed to say fragmentation? I don&#8217;t understand why they can&#8217;t support their own hardware&#8230; They don&#8217;t even have to work with other manufacturers.﻿</p>

<p>I just can&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re actually calling it BlackBerry 10&#8230;</p>
<p>They should have called it Blackberry 8: The Ocho.</p>
<p>Thank you for that.  It&#8217;s been a crappy day and I needed a chuckle.</p>
<p>os7</p>
<p>meet</p>
<p>playbook OS 1 and 2</p>
<p>aka OS 8 and 9</p>
<p>BB10 the merging software of both phone and tablet.</p>
<p>So nothing to do with wanting to call it BBX and then being sued into submission then?</p>
<p>BBX is better&#8230; But in the end it doesn&#8217;t matter.. If BBX costs too much BB10 will work fine.. I doubt anyone will not buy a phone because BB10 doesn&#8217;t sound cool enough sounds the same as Apple and MS..</p>

<p>Hasn&#8217;t this always been the case? As in BlackBerry 6 devices couldn&#8217;t get BlackBerry 7?﻿</p>
<p>Nope. BB4 upgraded to 5, and 5 to 6.</p>
<p>Only the higher tier hardware though. You had to meet the minimum hardware requirements to upgrade to the new OS.</p>
<p>Correct. Not all handsets on OS5.0 could upgrade to OS6.0 and NONE of the OS6.0 handsets were able to transition to OS7.0.</p>
<p>This should simply be called bbOS&#8230;no numbers, no letters, nothing designating <em>anything</em>. If anything, add the year to it&#8230;.as in <strong>bbOS 2012</strong>.</p>
<p>Start over.</p>
<p>But that implies FIXING the problem you guys were talking about: making sure the hardware can upgrade.</p>
<p>It works for Apple because all (virtually all) of their iPhones/Pods/Pads can get the new OS, so you don&#8217;t had ego worry about 90% of the population.</p>
<p>However, when you have 4+ phones running different specs, you can&#8217;t do that as it&#8217;ll lead to confusion.</p>
<p>Immagine if Android dropped the numbering scheme. See how bad that would be?</p>
<p>Yeah, I had a Pearl 8100 then the next Pearl (8120?) and do not recall ever getting anything more than minor incremental updates in the 30 months I had them.</p>
<p>But expectations are different now. Well for iOS, anyway. Expectations for upgrading Android we probably lower given how few handsets have actively been supported after sale. This is definitely an area where RIM can do better than Google.</p>
<p>What android have not been updated?</p>
<p>I think the number of handsets that never receive substantive Android OS upgrades probably outnumber those that do by a factor of 10:1, probably a worse ratio. If you only focus on premier handsets, it doesn&#8217;t look too bad, but if you factor in the hundreds of Android handsets launched each year it&#8217;s actually pretty bad.</p>
<p><a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">This</a> is dated about six months ago and looks pretty bad. This is supported by Google&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html">own data</a>.</p>
<p>Why SHOULD those phones get updated? As in what makes Gingerbread so much better than Froyo? Lol the only people that are bothered by Froyo phones not getting Gingerbread are people that aren&#8217;t using Froyo.. I bet you couldn&#8217;t even tell the difference between the two, and don&#8217;t forget the OEM&#8217;s add a large number of improvements themselves. I would rather use Touchwiz Froyo with a stock Launcher than use stock Gingerbread anyday&#8230;</p>
<p>Uh.. because new versions of Android are better? Better functionality, better security, better reliability, better efficiency in every regard. And there are apps that take advantage of more advanced versions of Android.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of any apps that would run on 2.3, and not 2.2 (or 2.1 for that matter) today. 4.0 does run apps the 2.3 builds won&#8217;t, but if history repeats that will even out. I do remember apps running on a current version initially, then later running on the older version. That is a dev responsibility.</p>
<p>Sorry, can&#8217;t recommend on mobile. Totally agree.</p>
<p>LOL &#8211; 10:1</p>
<p>Hundreds of handsets?  Where? Buying no name knock offs only available unlocked on the grey market doesn&#8217;t count as a phone release.</p>
<p>You own graphic shows every single device getting AT LEAST one upgrade, and many getting several. You missed the point of that 2 year old document that is no longer relevent. The point of that document is that android phones are not running the current version of android. A problem that is getting smaller. We are starting to see phones come out now on the current version.  And upgrades to the current version for phones that were in the hands of consumers before the hardware spec for the update was even known.</p>
<p>PlayBook will have BlackBerry 10?</p>
<p>Playbook basically is BlackBerry 10 lite. RIM said a couple months ago that the PlayBook would get BlackBerry 10.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone honestly believed BB7 would upgrade to BB10.</p>
<p>Agreed.  I&#8217;m not even sure why this is news.</p>
<p>1) BB10 minimum processor spec is dual-core.  There IS no dual-core BB7.<br />
2) Completely different architecture</p>
<p>I know a bunch of BB users are going to get all pissy about not being able to upgrade, but all I can say is thank god –– The whole model of no-man-left-behind that they&#8217;ve been doing has only stagnated innovation and forced those weak iterative OS updates they kept putting out (other factors involved with that too of course). Just take a look at the PC market and the backwards-compatibility strategy Microsoft has used, compared to say Apple, who ruthlessly deprecates legacy features and hardware. I&#8217;m not saying they should be like Apple in that regard (it&#8217;s a bit pompous, imo) but I&#8217;m glad that they are finally finally making a clean break from the past.</p>
<p>n.b. I suppose they took this strategy with BB  7 hardware as well, but the legacy software essentially made the break moot and irrational –– resulting in pissed off torch owners.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised blackberry would do this..  I thought for sure they would have learned from the painful process Windows Mobile to Windows Phone users have gone through..  is Blackberry ready for a 2 year long drawn out process while one market collapses and the other doesn&#8217;t grow as quick as hoped?</p>
<p>I love my windows phone, don&#8217;t get me wrong.. i just can&#8217;t imagine any sane organization going through with it &#8211; especially one that doesn&#8217;t have the billions in bank like MS does to ride it out..</p>
<p>PPS, how the HELL are developers going to earn 10,000 bucks when the market is starting from scratch essentially?</p>
<p>Yea it seems like neither rim or windows phone want that third spot</p>
<p>The same way every new console gets developer support?</p>
<p>Microsoft is about to do it again, so obviously they haven&#8217;t learned either. It really doesn&#8217;t matter anyways. Consumers do not care about these things as much as we would like to think.</p>
<p>I say tough luck for BB7 users but it makes sense, especially due to hardware limitations of current models (although we don&#8217;t exactly know what BB10 will offer, but I would guess it would have limited compatibility with old hardware anyway). I do think they should change the name as the commenter above, BBOS? something simpler, don&#8217;t stick with the old system.</p>
<p>Apple did it with OS X&#8230; Worked out for them</p>
<p>True true, well we will see then</p>
<p>No surprise here.  No way the hardware in the current lineup is near capable of running a QNX based OS.  Most low end android phones have more powerful CPUs than current gen blackberries.</p>
<p>I knew this when I bought my 9930 in August.  Doesn&#8217;t make me love it any less.  When the time comes, I will get a BB10 QWERTY phone.</p>
<p>Im in the same boat. I love my 9930 and my playbook. Will probably get the qwerty phone but may try out the all touch if its really really sexy.</p>
<p>Fair. But brutal.</p>
<p>Not much different from the Lumia 900 not getting WP8 then.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>Ugh&#8230;why bring something completely unrelated into this? Also, bullshit.</p>
<p>Thats Branchio&#8217;s MO.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s BranchioMotor</p>
<p>How is it unrelated? Another current platform that is going to have no upgrade path to the next version. It is definitely related. It has been basically been confirmed by people like Paul Therrot, not to mention Microsofts silence on the issue. It is not bullshit at all.</p>
<p>is it confirmed? no right</p>
<p>pretty much is when everyone that is important thinks so&#8230;.I would trust these people better than anyone else in here&#8230;</p>
<p>The silence from Microsoft is not not-deafening</p>
<p>This was stated by RIM a long time ago. It is necessary and not unreasonable at all.  Look to Apple devices that cannot be updated. The MS Windows Mobile devices that can&#8217;t run Windows Phone.  Android devices that can&#8217;t be upgraded to the newest versions.  It has to happen with big software and OS changes.</p>
<p>I hope that there will still be an updated version of the 9900 style devices running the current OS if they are going to continue to offer the old OS for the while.  It NEEDS a better battery but really is a solid smartphone.</p>
<p>But didnt they just release the bold 9900??</p>
<p>Will BB10 run on the HTC HD2?</p>
<p>Everything runs on the HD2.</p>
<p>Crysis?</p>
<p>BB!0 devices being based off of QNX will require an entirely new and separate version of BES.  To my knowledge it hasn&#8217;t been released yet. Right now the PlayBook uses ActiveSync from MS for email.  BB7 devices would use one BES server and BB10 would require an entirely separate BES server for the newer devices.  The idea of running two separate BES servers is somewhat less than appealing from a licensing, hardware and management perspective. If they are able to get a ground up rewrite together that can handle both I&#8217;d be much happier.</p>
<p>Why do you think you would need two BESs to support BB7 and BB10? At most, you need to apply an update to the BES.</p>
<p>The reason the PlayBook shipped without email was due to the fact that it would need a complete ground up rewrite of BES. (Why else do you think it was such a blatant omission?  As far as I&#8217;ve read it won&#8217;t run on the same version of BES as earlier BBOS&#8217;s.  If they could have put out a patch then they never would have needed to use Active Sync on the PlayBook.</p>
<p>So a complete rewrite would not be able to include support for multiple devices?</p>
<p>As far as I&#8217;ve read the two wouldn&#8217;t be able to run on the same BES Server that it would require two entirely separate BES servers. I just looked for the article to provide a link but couldn&#8217;t find it at the moment. <br />
From what I know they are having a very difficult time working with multi core chipsets, and they are having a lot of trouble getting a QNX based email client to work with BES. The COlt will be releasing as a single core from what I&#8217;ve read and with Active Sync instead. Maybe they will be able to get the two to work together but their failure to mention it was surely intentional.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s absolute fail that even a complete rewrite wouldn&#8217;t be able to support multiple device types. Maybe they should just stick with ActiveSync.</p>
<p>What is left of BlackBerry if not their BES email and client? Especially since BBM is now largely irrelevant. BES was/is their enterprise selling point.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much left if they really can&#8217;t get their products to use BES without needing two separate BES installs. That&#8217;s absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>as a bb9300 user i think that at least i got bb 6 upgrade but for those using 9800 torch its just wrong&#8230;.</p>
<p>RIM still expect people to buy their bb 7 phones?</p>
<p>sigh</p>
<p>The only thing that makes me mad about this is that rim continued to sell BB7 devices&#8230;.Why?? Why not just shut down and reorganize&#8230;.I dont understand this model of selling a product that has no chance of upgrading to the latest and better software&#8230;WTH is wrong with these companies?? The funny part is people are fine about it&#8230; Not me hell no&#8230;I would be on the phone right now getting my money back&#8230;.Buying a phone and then not getting the major os update that will supposivedly change the way rim does business. It just seems like a major oversight to me&#8230;Sit here and say oh well it was coming?? The new blackberries should at least get it because once they switch I bet there will be some incompatibilities.</p>
<p>Because the costs of shutting down production and having no market presence are a hell of a lot higher than continuing to run, even if they are losing cash in the mean time.</p>
<p>And before people comment saying oh I am sure they will receive bug updates&#8230; Save your comment if my phone was bought within a year and bb10 comes out and they say o well heres a bug fix&#8230;.I would be really angry</p>
<p>First they don&#8217;t update BB 6 to 7<br />
Then they won&#8217;t upgrade BB 7 to 10<br />
I see a pattern there</p>
<p>I thought this has been known for some time?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on a Nexus now but I bought a Bold 9930 knowing it wouldn&#8217;t be upgraded to BB10.</p>
<p>The real unknown is how many months will it take for the Galaxy Nexus get JellyBean. And will it even be the first phone to be upgraded from ICS to JB?</p>
<p>It took the Nexus S what, 4 months, to get an official update? The Galaxy S II almost beat it, with adding TouchWiz. The Nexus One &#8211; no official update at all.</p>
<p>Google has a poor track record with the Nexus devices getting the best updates. I would feel mislead if I had bought a Nexus S.</p>
<p>Regardless this is a slap in the face of anyone that buys a BlackBerry for the next 6 months.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that RIM now has a complete focus on developing the BB10 platform and that virtually no further development on the old Java-based platform is taking place. They can&#8217;t afford to have employees working on a dead end platform, and employees don&#8217;t want to waste their time and skills on a project that&#8217;s effectively ended.</p>
<p>They recently released the 7.1 update, and they included more up-to-date html5 dev tools for making apps that are both forwards and backwards compatible (ie will work on the legacy platform and BB10) and will give the look and feel of the BB10 UI.</p>
<p>Frankly I think this is the right way to do things. Focus all your energy on pushing out the best experience on new, great hardware, while allowing devs to build apps that are either native (BB10) or html5 (BB 5, 6, 7 + BB10).</p>
<p>Current BlackBerry users should treat this as a sign of a much better UX coming, not as a shaft for being long-time customers.</p>
<p>..so since they&#8217;re still selling (or trying to sell anyway) BB7 devices &#8211; and will presumably still sell them for a while &#8211; are they essentially committing to supporting two mobile OSes simultaneously?</p>
<p>..or do they completely EOL BB7 and all those devices the second BB10 hits the scene and act like it never existed?</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t matter. Nokia still supports Symbian and brings new Symbian devices although they are transitioning to Windows Phone. But for all matters and purposes Symbian is dead, there is no App development to speak off and sales are A LOT worse than they anticipated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure it will be the same for RIM when it comes to BB7 devices.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not even a little bit surprised.  I can&#8217;t see what they showed yesterday on a BB7 device.</p>
<p>I like the idea of keeping BB OS 7 for cheaper phones. Use the current blackberry models as they are very successful in developing countries. Use OS10 as a high end device globally. <br />
Makes a lot of sense and I think RIM might survive after all. The only question is if they can beat Microsofts windows phone 8. Those 2 are going to have a heated race for the 3rd spot (most likely overtake Apple in 5-7 years).</p>
<p>This is going to bite them in the ass though if they do that.  Your low end and high end run completely different OSes?  It is just going to cost more money in support to maintain the old OS and hardware.  They need to cut the cord and move forward.</p>
<p>I hope BB10 comes out before Microsoft Apollo because Microsoft Marketing budget is massive and they are coming out with some nice services for the platform.   I hope BB10 has a solid OS but the ecosystem around it needs to be on par or better than what Microsoft has to offer because lets face it IOS and Android are out of reach for BB at this point so holding on to the 3rd spot is vital for survival</p>
<p>As if anyone needed more of a reason not to buy a BB right now&#8230;</p>
<p>Given the temporal gap between the release of 7 and 10, the (hopefully) dramatic difference between the two, and the leaps hardware has made in the interim&#8230; this seems completely reasonable.</p>
<p>Given that ICS has been out for over 6 months, yet only 2.7% of Android devices have updated to it, and the vast majority of Android users will be on new devices before their current devices are ever updated, then as a practical matter, there&#8217;s no upgrade path to ICS either.  Such an upgrade path exists only in theory (except for for a very small percent of the Android user base).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you should count November as the ICS release date. At the very least is should be late December when the Galaxy Nexus actually shipped. Realistically I think the OS is &#8220;released&#8221; once its available to end users. Even Google expects it to take months for the new version to be on non Nexus devices. With the Nexus S getting its official update in March that is more reasonable, and April as the first non Nexus running ICS even more reasonable. Almost every android phone gets at least one OS bump. Do I expect my Eclair device to get ICS? No. But most devices that shipped on Gingerbread should get ICS, but maybe not JB.</p>
<p>Looks like the iOS App&#8230;.</p>
<p>&amp; Android</p>
<p>yeah. i can&#8217;t even imagine why anyone would care about this. not bringing anything new to the table, still just trying to catch up.</p>
<p>These are things that all the other platforms have, if RIM was to launch a new platform without facebook and twitter, people <em>would</em> care about that. I disagree that no one cares about this stuff.</p>
<p>if it <em>didnt</em> have social apps, then it&#8217;d be news.</p>
<p>announcing adequacy is not newsworthy.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope they didn&#8217;t take a screenshot of the iOS Facebook app :/</p>
<p>Even != EVENT</p>
<p>I bet it&#8217;s the HTML5 based facebook app.</p>
<p>They said it&#8217;s native in the article. Did you bother reading?</p>
<p>It could still be HTML5 based, although facebook has said they are moving away from that so who knows&#8230; RIM has an HTML5 app development framework called WebWorks (which is actually pretty good), it could be based on that and maybe even still called &#8220;native&#8221; by some standards.</p>
<p>It better be an html wrapper. No way any of these services would waste real time on a ship they know very well has already sunk</p>
<p>We be trollin&#8217;, not doing that readin&#8217; thang.</p>
<p>Read the article. It suggests the Facebook app was made by RIM themselves.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about BB 10 is can you write apps in plain ol&#8217; C with a lot less constraints than current app development/</p>
<p>Euhm, you write windows phone apps in C#, and iOS apps in Objective C&#8230; What&#8217;s your point?</p>
<p>Point of clarity here. C# is an interpreted language, not a compiled language like C, C++, or Objective C. Either way, you are basically right. The limitations of the development environment have less to do with the language the apps are written in and much more to do with the APIs available to app developers.</p>
<p>What kind of idiot comment is:<br />
<blockquote>It better be an html wrapper. No way any of these services would waste real time on a ship they know very well has already sunk</blockquote><br />
&#8230;when the article clearly mentioned that RIM developed it themselves?</p>
<p>But I wanted Pinterest. /s</p>
<p>OMG Facebook! I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this on a mobile device before</p>
<p> /s</p>
<p>Were you expecting a revolutionary Facebook app?</p>
<p>That would be a good start.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s more important than getting the OS perfect cause one app will make people buy the phone?</p>
<p>What does a revolutionary facebook app even look like? What does that even mean? It&#8217;s a facebook app. It&#8217;s like a screwdriver, it has a defined purpose, there isn&#8217;t a lot of room to innovate there.</p>
<p>That app crashed several times in the demo&#8230;</p>
<p>Hence why its in Beta?</p>
<p>And yet the scrolling was smoother than Android has ever seen.</p>
<p>Have you not used Android for a few years? I have, never noticed a problem like I used to have with my iPhone 3G, perhaps I&#8217;ve just been lucky with Android devices, obviously there&#8217;s something there because Google have started to rectify it with Project Butter in Jellybean, but there&#8217;s certainly a whole load of bullshit being spread because someone saw a YouTube vid of lag which didn&#8217;t show the manufacturers &#8216;skin&#8217; made it worse or that 10 apps were open at the same time</p>
<p>Have you not used an iPhone since your 3G? Even then, each iPhone at it&#8217;s launch was always very smooth in relation to the year. Android was always a mixed bunch up until 4.0. Still even benchmarks show the new iPhone is smoother and faster compared to any Android device including the quad core SGS III.</p>
<p>How is it not obvious that a company that makes both the hardware and the software can do better with less hardware than a company that only makes the hardware?</p>
<p>That is a misconception. Look at palm and the palm pre. Or look at RIM with BBOS prior to version 7 and their &#8220;liquid graphics&#8221;. Performance was poor,  RIM and palm made both the hardware and the software. Look at Google with jelly bean, performance is good and much improved, different hardware and software makers.</p>
<p>The thing that makes software perform better with less hardware is <em>optimization</em>.</p>
<p>Wrong. The S3 beat it, the One X beats it and the mid range One S beats it. Look it up. Funny how when the Android fans were saying how the 4S was getting ripped in benchmarks, the Apple fans were saying ‘But benchmarks don&#8217;t matter&#8217; or ‘But it just matters about real world performance&#8217;. Now all of a sudden the Apple fans are touting benchmarks around all over the place because they think they have won something, which they haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Obviously you&#8217;ve been &#8216;looking it up&#8217; at Android fanboy central.</p>
<p>Go and check Anandtech benchmarks. The iPhone 5 outperforms all those phones.</p>
<p>PS: DisplayMate and Anandtech say it&#8217;s the best screen they&#8217;ve ever tested in a mobile device :)</p>
<p>Aaanndd you did exactly what he said that most Apple fans do, you&#8217;re disadvantaged in hardware with most iPhones in benchmarks, and now all of a sudden you have good benchmarks and &#8216;the overall user experience&#8217; doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Facts and fanboys don&#8217;t mix. Facts have no place in a flame war.</p>
<p>android version is html5 for now, but it looks like they are writting native</p>
<p>But&#8230;will the Facebook app be as terrible as it is on Android?</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Yes.</p>
<p>Nope, much faster.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s native, so no.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong but I just don&#8217;t see RIM pulling this off. Don&#8217;t most BlackBerry users love the Keyboard? Are they going away from it entirely? <br />
Competition is great and time will tell.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s completely DOA. There is absolutely no reason that anybody would choose this phone, unless it was by mandate from their IT department.</p>
<p>This thing will be riddled with problems just like the Playbook was. It will be a regretful purchase.</p>
<p>I bought  a Playbook with the first OS and I&#8217;ve had no serious issues with it and it was certainly better than Android 1 or 2 which I&#8217;m willing to bet had way more &#8216;issues&#8217;.</p>
<p>It got even better after the first OS update.</p>
<p>The Playbook is an excellent tablet.</p>
<p>They plan on releasing BB10 devices with physical keyboards I do believe.</p>
<p>Yes, they already confirmed that. It will get a 720&#215;720 display.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both Facebook and App World looked as fast as everything else we&#8217;ve seen so far on BlackBerry 10&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s downplaying how smooth the transitions were. They were super smooth, scrolling, peeking and opening profile page.</p>
<p>Let us rejoice in mediocrity!</p>
<p>Did anyone notice Twitter live tile?</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s more apps than what WP8 has. /troll</p>
<p>its sad but its true.</p>
<p>it can run android apps too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not true actually. WP has surpassed 100,000 apps already.</p>
<p>OMG they are gonna have 4 social networking apps!! Amazing! Everybody will want one! (sarcasm)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of no keyboards on blackberry, but i&#8217;ll be taking a good long look at launch time. There&#8217;s an upgrade waiting for it at that point as well, so if not, well, the successor to the GSIII or the next google nexus device is likely to be around that time too.. i can wait.</p>
<p>They will have a keyboard model for you shortly after this is released.</p>
<p>Skype?</p>
<p>How is it a hands on when you can&rsquo;t touch the device?</p>
<p>You can hold it, but it&rsquo;s a guided experience of the handset.</p>
<p>Whoops.</p>
<blockquote>we aren&rsquo;t able to play too much with the device</blockquote>
<p>Reading helps.</p>
<p>Might be my mistake, but I am positive that it said that the article said that they were not allowed to touch the device.</p>
<p>it did say:  &ldquo;Representatives currently aren&rsquo;t letting us touch the device&rdquo; , Sherlock up there wants to sound clever by posting like that.</p>
<p>At first they refused when we asked to touch the device, but when we persisted we were given a very brief chance to use the keyboard and hold the phone.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t say <em>whose</em> hands.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://img.reversegif.com/8710.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/1mkGdBB.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Can you not the see the hands on the device in the pictures&hellip;? Nobody said it was a video. Just said they were limited.</p>
<p>Fingertips on</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re missing the point. As Steve Jobs used to say &ldquo;&hellip;. you can hold it in your hands. It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;.. he didn&rsquo;t say anything about using it&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>we aren&rsquo;t able to play too much with the device</blockquote>
<p>Reading helps.</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t keep the same screen size with a slide out keyboard.</p>
<p>Guess that will come with later devices. Just nice to see hardware keyboards are sticking around, though if BB10 bombs, that will be a mute argument. here&rsquo;s hoping it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A mute argument would be interesting to see &mdash; lots of gesticulating and maybe a few thrown punches. [insert trollface with word usage nazi symbol on forehead here]</p>
<p>But seriously, agreed. A greater diversity of ideas leads to a greater diversity of ideas. Steve Jobs was wrong, death is not the best thing to happen to life, the fact that we are not all the same is. (But really, can you blame a man for rationalizing his mortality?)</p>
<p>I like it. I loved the 9, with touch/keyboard. Just something about BB. Oh&hellip;wait, now I know how Apple fans feel.</p>
<p>i am also looking forward to a torch 10 or whatever they&rsquo;re gonna call it. this one will have my money depending on cost.</p>
<p>Slider phones are notoriously susceptible to hinge breaking and others quality control issues. RIM&rsquo;s sliders have held up pretty well, but they&rsquo;re more expensive to manufacture, so I&rsquo;m thinking RIM thought to launch the classic &ldquo;BB Bold&rdquo; model for now, to get the attention of corporate purchasers.</p>
<p>Agree here. Plus it is pretty tough to make a decent sliding phone that can pack in all the specs you want at the price you need.</p>
<p>BB&rsquo;s Bold line has always been gorgeous. I want this phone. But I&rsquo;ll settle for the software in my Playbook.</p>
<p>That would make the phone too thick probably. And the mechanism might get flimsy by time. The screen looks really good though. PPI is actually higher than the iPhone 5 even.<br /><a href="http://pixelcalc.com/?width=720&height=720&size=3.1" target="_blank">http://pixelcalc.com/?width=720&height=720&size=3.1</a><br /><a href="http://pixelcalc.com/?width=1136&height=640&size=4" target="_blank">http://pixelcalc.com/?width=1136&amp;height=640&amp;size=4</a></p>
<p>Also do they have some kind of anti-glare coating on the screen? Looks less reflective than other phones.</p>
<p>Is the display a touchscreen?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This Q10 excites me more than the Z10. Wish the Q10 had a bigger screen though. Gestures look cramped on this square screen.</p>
<p>My love of a good, clicky keyboard pains me so when I&rsquo;d really just like to have a larger screen.</p>
<p>You realize they&rsquo;re launching this literally side by side with the touch-only Z10, right?</p>
<p>No way! How&rsquo;d I miss that?</p>
<p>No, really. Point is that I like both form factors and can&rsquo;t have both. Larger screen wins.</p>
<p>Hence the need for a portrait slider.</p>
<p>I would really like to see the Q10 jumbo sized to phablet form, it would be the most functional one, the reason I say that is because of the screen real estate. To have a Q10 as big as the note II would great. But the Q10 as is will most likely get my money.</p>
<p>I was a huge fan of the physical keyboard, but I don&rsquo;t know if I could go back to one. Time will tell I guess.</p>
<p>touchscreens rule now<img src="http://bit.ly/WR4wkC" width="1" /></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t agree. Touch is fun and not too bad when you don&rsquo;t message a lot but when you need to hammer out a ton of messages quickly, be they text or email or even filling in a spreadsheet, a good physical QWERTY is still superior. Screen size is irrelevant. Even typing on my tablet is painful compared to using the keyboard dock.</p>
<p>I think you&rsquo;re wrong. Full sized physical keyboards are much better than virtual keyboards, regardless of size, but small keyboards like q10&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t offer any advantage over a virtual keyboard, quite the opposite actually, I like to write with one hand by swiping.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to one-hand Swype the way a hardcore business user is going to two-hand a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>I have a GS3. You know how big that screen is. It still doesn&rsquo;t compare in a favorable way to the smaller keyboard of the BlackBerry Tour I used to have&hellip;even with its auto correction and word suggestion. I simply cannot get as much serious typing done as I used to. I can get a lot more other things done though and it offsets the inferior typing productivity.</p>
<p>By your logic, I should also be able to hammer out some insanity on my Transformer tablet&rsquo;s virtual keyboard but it just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>
<p>There are still people buying into the&hellip; &ldquo;People who actually get work done only use physical keyboards!&rdquo; eh?</p>
<p>Portrait virtual keyboard is equal to or superior to physical portrait keyboard.  Your last line is a little silly&hellip; of course a full sized keyboard is better than a virtual keyboard for a tablet.  That&rsquo;s not what is being discussed here though.</p>
<p>That is not what I said at all. Physical keyboards are indeed dying off but it&rsquo;s not because virtuals are superior. It&rsquo;s because touch screens as a whole are preferred.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people are settling for mangled horrible spelling and grammar or they&rsquo;re slowing down.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even go so far as to say your one handed swiping is probably crap compared to what I used to be able to do when I had my BlackBerry. You may claim it&rsquo;s fast and easy but for all I know you&rsquo;re not actually doing much or you type like this: &ldquo;hw r u? im gud thx&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believe me, I&rsquo;m a fast, accurate typist but I SUCK on the S3 compared to the old Tour. The Tour is even MUCH smaller than the S3 AND the S3 makes a lot of corrections on my behalf. I&rsquo;m a business user and I am not alone in this.</p>
<p>Virtual keyboards are superior.  I have been using touch screen keyboards since the first iPhone.  I recently switched jobs and was handed a Bold.  It is a horrible phone and the keyboard is a major reason why.  Virtual keyboards, especially the iPhone keyboard, are many times better than the hard keyboards that BB puts out.  It isn&rsquo;t really close to be honest.</p>
<p>I also have an S3 and the speed of typing isn&rsquo;t even comparable between the 2 device.  I am many times faster on the S3 and that keyboard isn&rsquo;t even that good.  I think you are alone on this one.</p>
<p>BlackBerry is not infamous for its keyboards. It is famous for its keyboards. I am definitely not alone in this.</p>
<p>A lot of people wish they had some kind of mutant combination of Android/iOS + BB Keyboard.</p>
<p>Heck even I would be slow on a BB at this point because it&rsquo;s been so long. Acclimation is almost always required when going from one kind of keyboard to another. Daily regular use is the real test and many folks are simply faster and more accurate with less finger strain on a BB physical than a virtual. Unfortunately the keyboard alone just isn&rsquo;t/wasn&rsquo;t enough to stay or return to the platform.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to disagree here.  I used BBs for a couple years and then moved to an iPhone 3G, then a GSII, then a Lumia 920.  No virtual keyboard is as good as a BB physical keyboard, at least imo.</p>
<p>I also type with two hands, but I&rsquo;ve typed in smartphones ranging from all sizes (3.5 to 5.5), and I prefer all of them to a tiny physical keyboard.</p>
<p>Moreover I don&rsquo;t know why you mean by my logic, because I merely pointed out that full size physical keyboard are better than virtual keyboards, regardless if its a 10" or 2" device. But small physical keyboards are not in any way better, and in many ways worse.</p>
<p>Tell me if I&rsquo;m mistaken, but what&rsquo;s a &ldquo;hardcore business user&rdquo;? And if they do exist, and insist on writing boring fucking shit with little ridged clicks, why do they bug their IT dept to accept the hot new iPhone and/or Android that their spouses bought them with their own money because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easier&rdquo; and &ldquo;just do it already&rdquo;. Me thinks this insistence on the buttons is a similar sentiment to how RIM executives responded to the original iPhone launch in 2007. Let&rsquo;s revisit. &ldquo;No fucking way,&rdquo; and &ldquo;it must be hooked up to some Mac&rdquo; I think is how they put it. Now it is 2013. It&rsquo;s taken them 6 YEARS to get to a position where they&rsquo;re telling the market they think they&rsquo;re ready. Pleading for developers. And users. Good riddance. In 6 months there&rsquo;s going to be a new set of new sexy coming from Samsung, Apple, Moto, and, yes, even Huawei, plus Nokia and HTC with a maturing third-place Windows Phone ecosystem that is going to make people pity BlackBerry, and BlackBerry is going to be in a Nintendo-like position where they&rsquo;ll be screaming WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US. And we all know where Nintendo is going. The new SEGA. Tick fucking tock.</p>
<p>BlackBerries were boring. iPhones were not. Don&rsquo;t confuse the OS with the typing experience. People didn&rsquo;t flock to the iPhone because typing was easier. People flocked to the iPhone because it had a fancy touch screen and could do a lot more stuff.</p>
<p>I love my S3. I can do a helluva lot with it. FAR more than I ever did with BlackBerry. That does not mean it&rsquo;s better for the task of typing. It&rsquo;s worse&hellip;and it&rsquo;s a huge 4.8" screen.</p>
<p>Calm down, they&rsquo;re only phones. They don&rsquo;t make or break who you are as a person.</p>
<p>Haha indeed. People take this stuff way too personally. To me the deciding factors are</p>
<p>1) What can I do with it?<br />
2) How easy or difficult/comfortable or uncomfortable are those things?</p>
<p>If my S3 had a BB keyboard I would be in HEAVEN. Well, if the form factor was somehow miraculous.</p>
<p>I see the virtual keyboard situation as &ldquo;making do&rdquo; because of the incredible feature set of the touch screen smart phone as a whole. I can do so many things on my Android phone that I could never do on BlackBerry, so it&rsquo;s worth tolerating. If I could get all the functionality of my Android phone PLUS have that fantastic physical BlackBerry keyboard again, I&rsquo;d be all in. This gives me hope but to buy all my apps again, it would have to be a lot more compelling than it is. Unlike most, I have hundreds of dollars worth of apps.</p>
<p>I would say it depends on the user. It&rsquo;s a very subjective thing, much in the same way people have varying WPMs on a standard qwerty keyboard, but that aside, the software keyboard works on media consumption devices because it&rsquo;s collapsible and thus provides more screen real-estate, while hardware buttons allow users to type without having to glance at the thumb-board to see where they&rsquo;re going.</p>
<p>Yep these touch screen phones are mostly consumption rather than production devices. I find myself using the S3 as a hotspot to the laptop or tablet to actually get stuff done. Tablet Talk is a fantastic app for throwing smart phone texts to and from the Transformer tablet (which I have keyboard docked 99% of the time) for easier communication&hellip;especially when I have a running conversation with a client. Voice dictation is getting better but it&rsquo;s not there yet. One day I&rsquo;ll be able to simply use that&hellip;I hope.</p>
<p>I never really wished for good voice dictation or sought out an SMS app when I had the BB. The keyboard never made me think twice about it being harder than it needed to be.</p>
<p>Having said all that, getting me back on BBOS will be an extremely tough sell.</p>
<p>A few years back I would write out huge emails and work on spreadsheets while riding taxis between client visits on my BB.  I haven&rsquo;t had that level of productivity in a smartphone in a while.  But I just don&rsquo;t know if I could go back to BB, especially after just getting a WP that runs Office&hellip;</p>
<p>If the unlocked pricing is right, just maybe&hellip;</p>
<p>like riding a bike my friend.</p>
<p>I wonder how widescreen apps will work on this device, if you will be able to scroll through them somehow, if you will have black bars and a tiny widescreen or if they will only show optimized square apps.</p>
<p>Obviously they will be optimized. This is why rim settled for 720&#215;720.</p>
<p>But will developers optimize 100% of the apps? Or is that optional?</p>
<p>If RIM knows what they&rsquo;re doing they won&rsquo;t be accepting apps without 720&times;720 optimizations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two fucking screen sizes.</p>
<p>Where are the specs?</p>
<p>You guys know that &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; is kind of a figure of speech.  Meaning the device in hands up close in personal.  Not &ldquo;ZOMG we are holding this device with OUR hands at for X amount of time&rdquo; etc.  How can the best tech site in the world be full of such whiney fucking kids!?</p>
<p>The Q10 looks a lot better in my opinion. Z10 looks like a prototype and I can&rsquo;t stop saying that enough.</p>
<p>the Z10 does have a certain unfinished quality to it. I think if they would have taken the Tour design, stretched and slimmed it, make it all screen, it would be more of a winner than it already is.</p>
<p>I was thinking the same thing. You can definitely tell the Z10 is a first-gen device. The Q10 actually looks really solid just like their older, non-Blackberry 10 offerings.</p>
<p>Watching the live feed of the after event coverage and David nailed it, the killer app is BlackBerry&rsquo;s physical keyboard! They should have made the screen a bit taller on the Q10 and it would have been electrifying.</p>
<p>Misleading title&#8230; Rim is back!! IOS is so dated anything is better at this point</p>
<p>I really like the option of choice, I would really like to see WP8, Android#,iOS, and BB10 all on par and bridged with premium software, I don&rsquo;t care about apps. It would be a sad world if app makers decided the fate of these companies, I think app makers are showing the world this is what is to come if things were left in their hands.</p>
<p>is this gone save a dying company</p>
<p>This might not be the device that pulls in users from other brands, but it might well be the device that keeps their current users on board.</p>
<p>I think Blackberry is smart to not alienate their user base.</p>
<p>Im falling in love with this new device, very very cool and a high refresh to the &ldquo;actual&rdquo; Bold 9900. I cant wait for get this thing. MUY BIEN, BLACKBERRY!! :-D</p>
<p>It is just the successor of the BB 9900 Bold Touch, with a different OS!</p>
<p>BLACKBERRY IS BACK BABY!!!!</p>
<p>I think you have a very long wait before you will be able to make that statement, if ever.</p>
<p>More like hand on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The back of the device is as Thorsten Heins described: it has a rubbery, soft-touch feel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s almost a Love Doll description</p>
<p>Is this consistant like iOS on every device (iPod touch, iPad, iPhone) with updates and apps, or like old BBOS where it&rsquo;s different everywhere?</p>
<p>anybody know what the screen ratio is for this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As such, we&rsquo;re not being shown any of the applications that are purported to be optimized for this 720 &times; 720 square display.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1:1.</p>
<p>Any guesses on pricing? The Z10 will be $200; are they going to charge a premium for a bigger screen or a physical keyboard?</p>
<p>I wish more phone companies made portrait sliders (like Palm&rsquo;s Pres and some BlackBerry Torches. I think Palm did a better job with the form factor). I like physical keyboards, but I also like decent touch screens. This one is square and too small.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be picking up a Z10 at launch.</p>
<p>Bummer. I was really hoping they would bring back the side jog dial.</p>
<p>zomg wheres the pearl?! ;p</p>
<p>This is better than sex!!!!</p>
<p>Must be having pretty terrible sex.</p>
<p>terrible sex&hellip; <br />
terrible&hellip; sex&hellip; <br />
terrible&hellip;</p>
<p>Nope sorry I don&rsquo;t comprehend..</p>
<p>Wow, I guess they didn&rsquo;t really want people to use it because of how horrible it must be. Blackberry is dead afterall.</p>
<p>I do wish the screen was a bit bigger but I could definitely be tempted to switch to this as long as all the apps work well on the smaller screen.</p>
<p>How would you make the screen bigger?</p>
<p>I suppose they could have gone &ldquo;tall and skinny&rdquo; like the iPhone 5, and made the screen a bit bigger that way.  I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want it any wider.</p>
<p>No, certainly not any wider, I would be happy if it was taller. The Q10 is <a href="http://crackberry.com/official-blackberry-q10-specs-and-features">119mm tall</a> so shorter than a Lumia 920 at 130mm or an Samsung GS3 at 136mm, so another 10mm in screen height and overall height would be no big problem, though it might make the phone top heavy while typing on the keyboard.</p>
<p>I wonder if BB10 has the keyboard shortcuts that I&rsquo;ve come to know and love in BB6&amp;7&hellip;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t lie; I think the Q10 looks fantastic. It&rsquo;s almost everything I like about Blackberry&rsquo;s industrial design. The lack of a curve to the keyboard will negatively impact typing, but I&rsquo;m sure the keyboard will be great otherwise.</p>
<p>But the app situation prevents me from even considering it.</p>
<p>Oh look, a Palm Pixi.  That&rsquo;ll save RIM..</p>
<p>I hope they stay in the market.</p>
<p>I hope mass-produced, easily affordable jet packs hit the market in my lifetime.</p>
<p>To fly 30 seconds? Flying cars powered by RIM QNX would be better.</p>
<p>QNX? There&#8217;s nothing special about QNX that would magically make phone batteries last 10x as long. Or even 2x as long. Yes, it&#8217;s a RTOS, but the magic behind an RTOS lies simply in its promise to respond to interrupts without extensive delays (like greater than 20ms). That and $5 may get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks.</p>
<p>Who said QNX would magically make phone batteries last 10x as long?</p>
<p>But OpenSource Linux 3.5 + Qt5 can   :D</p>
<p>Thorsten has alluded to exceptional battery life on the BB10 somehow due to the capabilities of the QNX RTOS&#8230;</p>
<p>So what did he really say? Do you have a source with an original quote? I tried to google it but to no avail.</p>
<p>But I guess he has not claimed batteries would last 10x as long, right?</p>
<p>I would guess he just spoke about good battery life in general terms.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s referring to the fact that QNX was used in aircraft (fighters, I believe). Find it in here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QNX</a></p>
<p>Me too. More competition is better for consumers. If RIM delivers on BB10, and it&#8217;s actually a great product, Apple and Google will have to step up their game.</p>
<p>hmm.. i doubt it.. they would only have to step up anything if bb10 would actually be successful.. only being good won&#8217;t do it.. webos was good.. but it had no impact on the competition at all.. they did get new ideas from them though.. so i guess that could happen with bb10 as well.. :)</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;the only completely new mobile platform on the market.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>How is that a good thing? Apart from possibly having clean code and maybe some new ideas.</p>
<p>Not being held back by any legacy features. Except the need to please Enterprise.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t &#8220;not being held back by any legacy features&#8221; describe WP7/8 as well?</p>
<p>Yes. I don&#8217;t agree with Heins&#8217; view. But I understand what he&#8217;s saying.</p>
<p>Even ICS doesn&#8217;t really have &#8216;legacy features&#8217;.  They made no attempt to allow &#8216;legacy&#8217; devices to run on ICS.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s possible to run on less, ICS is designed for 720p, dual core, 1 gig of RAM.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they mean &#8216;legacy&#8217; by the actual legacy devices.</p>
<p>It goes more in the way of legacy features like backwards software compatibility.</p>
<p>The question becomes whether or not that &#8220;new platform&#8221; does anything significantly &#8212; and I mean SIGNIFICANTLY &#8212; better than the current set of platforms.</p>
<p>You need to do something more than change the shape and color of the icons&#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not. Imagine what would happen if the next version of android or iOS dropped support for most of the apps.  Sure it&#8217;s neccessary and proper to start over sometimes (Mac OS X), but usually not so much.  <br />
Though windows really should have started over for Windows 8 (and put in some sort of backwards application compatibility like OS X did), they&#8217;re already losing support for applications for Windows RT, and their OS is a mess.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t Windows Phone 8 also share that distinction?</p>
<blockquote>The goal of BlackBerry 10 is to bring some of the best technologies in the world together in a seamless environment. </blockquote> <p>And bring back Elvis, hence the delay(s).</p>
<p>Who wants a half baked OS? Sounds like they learned a lesson from the playbook release. Hope it makes it to market.</p>
<p>well, if they knew what they wanted it to be they could have it running by the end of the year.</p>
<p>probably they don&#8217;t, hence the seams. the basic operating system functionality is technically probably there, but there are decisions to make about ui, sw(especially 3rd party) interoperability and so forth. wp took the route of just not making those decisions hence it lacking a shitload of features.. I suppose they think rightly that they just can&#8217;t start selling it with featureset stuck on mid &#8217;00s featurephone level.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see, seemingly endless development on a platform trying to catch up. That&#8217;s PalmOS for ya&#8230; Oh wait no it&#8217;s Duke Nukem Forever;) oh wait this article is about blackberry! Well surely this will buck the trend</p>
<p>If the Duke had cards e&#8217;d have been SO efficient.</p>
<p>At this point it doesn&#8217;t matter if the experience delivered is seamless or not. Who&#8217;s really going to want it?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Considering that many blackberry users are simply holdouts that love their qwerty keyboards, I don&#8217;t really see who will love it considering it&#8217;s only going to be the london at first. But we&#8217;ll see how things are in another <strong>half year</strong> for RIM</p>
<p>I still think RIM changing goals and releasing a line of android based devices (primarily qwerty) and apps to interface with their services (like BB Messenger) would work a lot better. Especially since with Android they could fork it and customize it so it meets all of their current enterprise features, while gaining access to the android ecosystem.</p>
<p>They would have to make Android secure first to meet their Enterprise standards and government certifications. Could be done but probably not within a few months either.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going to have to do that for the &#8220;all new BB10&#8221; anyways. It&#8217;s happened in the past for Android.</p>
<p>Well I assume that they have that already built it in BB10 right from start. While for Android they would have to start over from scratch.</p>
<p>There isn&#8217;t a point into forking Android, because BB10 will be able to run Android apps much like the PlayBook can.</p>
<p>Not to mention that QNX is a microkernel, which is much better at running on embedded and mobile systems than a monolithic kernel like Linux.</p>
<p>In a very complicated way, that works sometimes&#8230;</p>
<p>Microkernel is a recurring fad that hasn&#8217;t proved to be actually better in the real world yet.</p>
<p>Actually, the Nevada (the keyboard version) is supposed to launch simultaneously (key word: supposed to).</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not going to survive long enough for it to matter. Microsoft can take its sweet time with WinPhone8 and the Surface stuff, because it&#8217;s not banking their whole business on it. RIM, on the other hand, has nothing else but a waning smartphone market. I for one cannot wait to not have to deal with these damn phones and the BES server anymore. I&#8217;m tired of it, and it seems to get worse with every release.</p>
<p>aaaah BES&#8230; the only people who liked that were people getting paid to service it.</p>
<p>It really has got to the point that to compete in the mobile OS space you need a) a lot of money, and b) a wide range of services to complement the OS. Apple, Google and Microsoft are just too big for RIM to stand a chance! About the only other company I see having any chance is Amazon, but even that&#8217;s a stretch. RIM need to pull a Nokia/Samsung/HTC/Sony and outsource OS development, but concentrate on value add in to differentiate.</p>
<p>i&#8217;d assume amazon would follow their Kindle model and make a low cost phone that just works. They&#8217;re so big they can eat and hide any financial losses from the public (like they do with the Fire already). I think they find a niche next to Windows Phone and just milk it</p>
<p>If they get bought, I hope Amazon does it. They have the money and the store to show people for free. They can adapt BB10 to run apps from the appstore smoothly. They have already proven that they can make good hardware with the Fire. It is the perfect combo. The reason Amazon would want to buy them instead of just doing it themselves is because of patents. It is a lot easier to enter the mobile market with at least some patents to defend your os.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s what is to blame. Have you used recent Blackberrys? They&#8217;re horrible. That&#8217;s my opinion, of course, but they&#8217;re such an unintuitive PITA compared to older models, and they&#8217;ve also (anecdotally) gotten less reliable over the last couple years too. Sure, the &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; factor is a problem, but even in business (where ecosystem isn&#8217;t nearly as important as a good phone that securely gets email) they&#8217;re failing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s odd, I want RIM to continue on, because I feel like this is the first real shot any talent there has had in many years, but I highly doubt they&#8217;re going to build a better mobile OS than Windows Phone, and even that is having trouble gaining traction.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see seams too. The ones RIM is haemorrhaging money through.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lose lose anyway, either BB10 is a success and apple sue them or it fails and apple sues them.</p>
<p>If they would have sued apple for creating a mobile devices that could get email they&#8217;d still be around.</p>
<p>The whole OS must be stitched leather then.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve experience the Elop effect and now we&#8217;re at the beginning stages of the Heins effect.  He&#8217;s probably penning his burning manifesto right now.</p>
<p>What does it matter of BB10 is a &#8220;completely new&#8221; OS? Windows Phone could have been called that, so could iOS and Android at a certain point. It really doesn&#8217;t matter, in fact, having a &#8220;new&#8221; OS is actually a disadvantage because of the obvious lack of developer support for any OS at its origination.</p>
<p>BB10 is based off the PlayBookOS, which can run already run Android apps. It&#8217;s supposed to be able to run iOS apps soon too.</p>
<p>But It was actually good move that RIM decided to drop their old Blackberry OS and move to QNX.</p>
<p>Except that the Android player on the Playbook almost always crashes on startup.</p>
<p>And things like add-ons for Dolphin can&#8217;t be used.</p>
<p>And apps are closed much too quickly. It has 1GB ram, but a simple 1gb netbook can run a whole lot more without running into trouble.</p>
<p>After instaling 2.1 the Android Player did&#8217;t crash again for me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what you mean apps are closed much too quickly. They keep running for me. But I have enabled the full multitasking mode.</p>
<p>RIM is just going to make it easier and cheaper for another company to buy the patent portfolio from then in 16 months.</p>
<p>Microsoft<br />
Google<br />
Apple</p>
<p>I see a new Nortel IP/Patent Auction heading our way&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess that Canadian companies are cursed?</p>
<p>I would prefer Amazon.</p>
<p>As owner of both a BB9900 and a Playbook (gave my iPad away as I found it less functional than the Playbook for my needs), if BB10 can deliver what the Playbook already has plus get BBM and push e-mail in &#8211; then that will still be the best solution for me.  I like the true multitasking, full web capabilities, security &amp; ease of use.  My 5 year old son thought the iPad was broken becuase it &#8216;took to long and could only do one thing at a time&#8217; &#8211; while we know it can sort of multitask, it&#8217;s not nearly as intuitive.</p>
<p>As an FYI &#8211; my BB9900 has had NFC for close to a year still waiting for Apple to release this feature (the Playbook even has fart apps now &#8211; abou time!).  I do like the camera on the iPhone a lot better though.</p>
<p>&#8220;As owner of both a BB9900 and a Playbook (gave my iPad away as I found it less functional than the Playbook for my needs)&#8221;  translation:  as a totally insane person</p>
<p>Possibly,  but unlikely, but let&#8217;s look at the verifiable facts.</p>
<p>- I paid $249 for a 32GB tablet &#8211; what did you pay for your iPad?<br />
- I have centralized  email, true multi tasking, full web access, more games than I could ever play, now including  Angry Birds Space, GPS, 10hr battery, ability to connect my device to any HDMI screen/projector and the highest HTLM 5 tablet device on the market.<br />
- these are things you can verify yourself, if they make me insane, guilty as charged. If you&#8217;re wondering, the iPad went to a friend who needed a larger display and could not afford any tablet.<br />
-</p>
<p>Forget the seams.</p>
<p>The BB10 line NEEDED to be out in October. Waiting until Q1 2013 shows that RIM is not serious about competing.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5, along with the newest Android and Winpho 8 phones, are going  to saturate the market over the holiday season, so tell me why would phone users wait for the BB10 line again?</p>
<p>Heins appears to be out of touch with the phone market. RIM should dig deep into that extra $2 billion that they have and double their efforts to get the BB 10 line out in October . It&#8217;s no good having a &#8220;seamless&#8221; phone if everyone already has switched over to something else.</p>
<p>I own a BB and I&#8217;m beginning to doubt whether I will stay faithful to the line this holiday season.  The options are just too enticing to wait another 8+ months. I actually was holding out for the now delayed BB10 line.</p>
<p>This is sad.  I used to be a crackberry addict.  The 8700 was the phone that got me into smartphones.  I hope they will find a way through this, but for now I don&#8217;t see myself going back to RIM.</p>
<p>&#8216;I could still see some of the seams&#8217;<br />
Like the thinking.</p>
<p>If this delay means that BB10 will come out ready to compete, then more power to RIM for making the tough decision.  I anxiously await my QWERTY BB10 phone.</p>
<p>As for what kekus said above, as another 9930 and Playbook owner, I can tell you that it is one powerful combo.  BB Bridge means that as long as my 9930 has signal, my PlayBook has internet access for free.  I know my girlfriend wishes her iPhone 4s and iPad 3 had something like that and if Apple had done it, everyone would have been saying it was fabulous, but since it was RIM, everyone hates it.</p>
<p>Yes I am &#8220;BlackBerry by choice!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cool, this creates another incentive for devs to create apps. BlackBerry&#8217;s making some big moves now. Perhaps they&#8217;re taking their own advice and have decided to &#8220;wake up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there any functional version of BB10 near release to developers?  This runs playbook OS 2.0 and your supposed to develop apps for it that are supposed to be compatible with BB10, but this cant run BB10? What is going on here?  Stop telling us how great BB10 will be and actually give the devs a working version.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but I think it&#8217;s because the Dev Alpha hardware is missing a lot of the internals that a finished product will have so it won&#8217;t be usable as a cell phone or in any non-dev capabilities. It will continue to get software updates in conjunction with the PlayBook&#8217;s update cycle and you&#8217;ll obviously be able to test your apps and games on the form factor and screen resolution. If you create an app you can send back your Alpha unit and basically get an actual phone in return.</p>
<p>As far as I know RIM&#8217;s holding on to the broader UX in BB10 until launch, so until then they&#8217;ll unveil software updates piecing together the OS for devs but not to give away too much prior to official launch.</p>
<p>PBOS and BB10 are <strong>almost</strong> the same thing. RIM has been clear since PB OS2.0 came out, any app developed for the PlayBook will work on BB10. Developing on this alpha device gives the developers the resolution size (slightly larger than the PB) as well as <strong>some</strong> of the hooks that BB10 will have.</p>
<p>So to answer your question. Yes.</p>
<p>It was stated clearly that the developer devices run a very close version of the soon-to-be-released version of the BB10 OS. In fact it&#8217;ll be so close that the apps developed now can be used instantly when BB10 comes out. The QNX versions in the Playbook and the BB10 are bound to be similar so no worries. If you are going to develop an app the developer&#8217;s device will be a fine device to test it out on the smaller screen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a BB dev. How do I get one of these?</p>
<p>I think they were only for Developers that went to BBJam.</p>
<p>Just when I thought RIM was learning from their mistakes, and enter the 21st century, they do something like this &#8230; and totally prove me right.</p>
<p>First decent looking, modern hardware they produce in a decade, and it not only won&#8217;t ever see its way to consumers hands, it won&#8217;t run the software that it is designed to test software for.</p>
<p>At least we know RIM is consistent.</p>
<p>*wasn&#8217;t learning from their mistakes, and entering the 21st century</p>
<p>This is a testing device. It looks rather boring to me, for that matter. And did you ever check the BB London leaks?</p>
<p>I generally ignore RIM news. I&#8217;ve been counting down the days to the Galaxy S 3 event for weeks. I didn&#8217;t even know BlackBerry had an event going on until I checked the site for any more info on the Galaxy S 3. So, I don&#8217;t know what you are referring to with BB London leaks.</p>
<p>I think that design is simple, elegant, crisp, thin, and fresh. I think the BlackBerry designs generally look like a prediction of the future completed years ago, if that makes sense. I have never been one for two handed phone typing or keybaords in general. That&#8217;s just my preference, this alpha device looks nicer than any BlackBerry I have ever seen.</p>
<p>So how will BB developers test their app if their Dev phones won&#8217;t come with the consumer-intended version of the BB OS for the market?</p>
<p>Comeon</p>
<p>Me thinks RIM is HIDING their new sexy hardware.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait for RIM to unveil the new BB10 devices!!!! Based on the specs given on the alpha developer device itself I&#8217;m honestly contemplating jumping ship from Windows Phone to BB10 xD</p>
<p>Hey look, it&#8217;s a Galaxy SII.</p>
<p>/reversetroll</p>
<p>Same vibe I&#8217;m getting from this. Will Samsung sue RIM? o.O</p>
<p>More like Generic slab mock-up<br />
/disasteraverted</p>
<p>Anywho don&#8217;t see anything extraordinarily new here except a slightly different sharing interface. A mashup of Android&#8217;s share screen+BB10&#8217;s addition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still having a hard time wrapping my head around the UX on BB10, but I think my lack of research is as much to blame for that as anything else. From what I can tell, they put Windows 8, Android, webOS, iOS in a blender. Whether the OS smoothy end up good is anybody&#8217;s guess.</p>
<p>Which is an iPhone 4.</p>
<p><img src="http://i37.tinypic.com/302w50k.jpg" /></p>
<p>P.S. That&#8217;s a JPEG.</p>
<p>P.P.S.  That&#8217;s a GIF with a &#8220;.jpg&#8221; filename extension.</p>
<p><em>You win this round..</em></p>
<p>Well aren&#8217;t you <em>special</em>.</p>
<p>Well no the Blackberry designers were not awful enough to put the screen corners pretty much inline with the outer case radius, which is what makes the GSIII look like shit.</p>
<p>He said S2, you&#8217;re arguing about S3.</p>
<p>Big difference.</p>
<p>I Samsunged myself!</p>
<p>Samsung got RIMmed.</p>
<p>They got a RIMjob.</p>
<p>ermhagerd, a phone with a screen. Sue sue sue!</p>
<p><del>_</del></p>
<p>Apple and Samsung ripped off blackberry!</p>
<p>/inversetroll</p>
<p>Maybe im alone here, but im excited to see what they have cme up with.  It definitely seems different.</p>
<p>Yeah. <em>You&#8217;re alone.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to see what they can come up with to save their business, but I&#8217;m unsure if it&#8217;ll work. It&#8217;s too late IMO.</p>
<p>You are not alone. I am here with you.</p>
<p>As much as I enjoy leaks, this isn&#8217;t much of a reflection of what BB 10 will look like. I firmly believe this is older documentation that has now become a thing of the past but the same principals (the sharing methods) will be in place when BlackBerry 10 launches. I suspect this even predates BlackBerry World which was held in May.</p>
<p>I am also excited as hell for an opportunity to have some more diversity in the smart phone market. BB10 is more than a smart phone , it&#8217;s mobile computing. Tired of the same ole undroid&#8217;s and iphones We need something different. Thank god for BlackBerry!</p>
<p>we already have that. It&#8217;s called windows phone<br />
but tech &#8220;journalists&#8221; are contractually obligated to deride it at every opportunity</p>
<p>Maybe they honestly aren&#8217;t into it&#8230;</p>
<p>funny, because blackberry is already the &#8220;3rd ecosystem&#8221;. It outsells windows phone continuously.<br />
But tech &#8220;arm chair&#8221; analysts are contractually obligated to deride journalists for not being excited by yet another ecosystem which is in decline.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure the Colt was confirmed as the Dev Alpha device.</p>
<p>So many misinformed users&#8230; the phone isn&#8217;t a copy of the Samsung anything! Remember, Samsung has blatantly copied Apple and RIM&#8217;s design on many occasions in the past. These are just concepts of BlackBerry Dev Alphas in white. The Dev Alpha is a mini PlayBook in design. For those who haven&#8217;t handled the alpha phone, its of much higher build quality than the cheap, plasticy Samsung Galaxy S3, and it&#8217;s not even a production phone. You can bet RIM will change their hardware design for their production device.</p>
<p>Does anyone else still see seems?</p>
<p>Oh, why is that shitty Blackberry software being run on an iPhone 4?</p>
<p>Guys, this will change how we will interact with our world!</p>
<p>What an incredibly boring design. Yeah, must be a dev device or something, RIM&#8217;s hardware designers are capable of better than THIS at the very least.</p>
<p>RIM IS DEAD!</p>
<p>You guys realize that they are talking about the Facebook app and not the design of the phone right, its just a example&#8230;.</p>
<p>Guys, this is the DEV alpha they handed out, look at the story stream picture just adjacent to it.</p>
<p>This is the first thing I have ever liked about a Blackberry.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t like the text flicking? I like it better than the way android and iOS do it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s cool but a dev on Android can add that in a few days to one of their keyboard apps. We might even see this camera come to Android soon.</p>
<p>It looks cool on a huge presentation screen but I wonder if those small words will be as easy to identify on a 4.5&quot; screen a couple feet from my face with a bit of glare.</p>
<p>I find this feature weird&#8230;.</p>
<p>you take pictures to remember a moment</p>
<p>but this makes a picture of a moment that never REALLY happened.</p>
<p>still a sweet feature</p>
<blockquote>but this makes a picture of a moment that never REALLY happened.</blockquote>
<p>I hope nobody ever tells you about photoshop.</p>
<p>LOL didnt even think about photoshop</p>
<p>/derp</p>
<p>not quite the moments did happen .. but you only puting together the &#8220;best moments&#8221;</p>
<p>Licensed, so does that mean other companies like Apple, Google or Microsoft could also license it, or even buy the company?</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Yes, as they had already showcased the tech in HTC Android devices.</p>
<p>Whereas it could have simply been another app in a store. Which is why I value innovation through insightful integration of core features over browsing a &#8220;rich&#8221; ecosystem encompassing all mammals and bugs on the earth. I want a chef to cook me a great meal, not an empty plate for an all you can eat buffet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remove&#8221; system  ?? Its Rewind system.</p>
<p>You can learn more about it here. <a href="http://scalado.com/display/en/Showcases" target="_blank">http://scalado.com/display/en/Showcases</a></p>
<p>Its a situational Feature i think.</p>
<p>If I were Scalado, I&#8217;d collect my license fees upfront.</p>
<p>At least they didn&#8217;t swallow the fish so the deal won&#8217;t prohibit the whole industry from using that tech, so in the end you may even get it on your iPhone. You concern for Scalado is touching nonetheless.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone gives a crapo about scalado&#8230; on blackberry.</p>
<p>iDontCare about clever technology until it hits my app store? Luckily lots of people are more open minded and the feedback was very positive, irrespective of platform usage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite surprising to see someone actually lincensing something from someone else&#8230; It seems that copying the exact feature first and then settling in court is the way to go these days.</p>
<p>As this is not an exclusivity agreement, would anything stop Scalado creating a $1/$2 app on iPhone and Android. A few would buy this for their current phone, but not a reason to change to Blackberry.</p>
<p>Nice, I really liked the camera!</p>
<p>I think blackberry&#8217;s implementation is better than scalado&#8217;s, it&#8217;s live and appears smoother.</p>
<p>Ever thought that it might be Scalado that did the full implementation and integration together with RIM?</p>
<p>This is embarrassing.</p>
<p>BB should really just get rid of their entire software team and adopt Android instead.</p>
<p>.. and take Nokia guys with them.</p>
<p>Why would anymore companies what to join Android. The more companies that join the less a lot of them will make. Only the popular brand suceed and will always suceed such as Samsung and HTC the rest barely get by. Lucky companies like LG, Sony etc are in the buisness of various other comsumer products.</p>
<p>Nokia are just fine where they are. I think many of you will be surprised by them by the end of the year. Many dont realise the impact of Microsofts new path with Windows 8/RT, Windows Phone 8 and Xbox. Plus read the news and see how many people are excited about Microsofts new direction and feel Android is just and I quote &#8220;creepy&#8221;. Android is good but a lot of you seem to think it is the be all and end all.. Apple still exist so does Mircosoft. Nokia is in safe hands so they are not going anywhere.</p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>
<p>RIM have a very popular brand &#8211; Blackberry, so they can actually succeed with Android.</p>
<p>Android is horrible. An OS built by developers for developers and they&#8217;re still trying to put that right, even in version 4.</p>
<p>As to what? Windows phone?</p>
<p>2 versions in and they still haven&#8217;t gotten it right.</p>
<p>Welcome, DaHarder! I don&#8217;t recall seeing you comment here before, but you were one of the very few sensible people on <em>that other</em> blog that I used to read before The Verge existed.</p>
<p>Sensible? He replied to a biased personal opinion comment (&#8220;Android is horrible&#8221;) with biased personal opinion comment (&#8220;2 versions in and they still haven’t gotten it right.&#8221;) Far from sensible, just more flame-warring. Should fit in perfectly here, welcome!</p>
<p>How long did it took android to get it right? Not selling well does not mean Windows Phone team didnt get it right, pick one up and use it for a few days and you realize WP team is on the right track.</p>
<p>9 versions of Android and Google still hasn&#8217;t gotten it right.</p>
<p>I develop for android and I approve this message.</p>
<p>You think Android 4.0 is ugly?  I actually find it more modern and elegant compared to iOS, which looks tired and outdated.</p>
<p>Android 4 is more modern and elegant than iOS,but being more modern and elegant than iOS is like being prettier than Sarah Jessica Parker. Not really a difficult thing to achieve.</p>
<p>Yet it took all the way until 4.0 for it to match and surpass iOS. Gingerbread and earlier looked like crap without a custom launcher.</p>
<p>Ok, but at least they&#8217;re improving. iOS is on version 6 now and is still as ugly and boring as ever.</p>
<blockquote>An OS built by developers for developers</blockquote>
<p>Who do you think made iOS/Windows/OSX/Linux/whatevs? SEO Experts?</p>
<p>I am a current BlackBerry owner (former Apple 4s and Android user).  I plan on sticking with my Bold 9930 until at least BB10 is released.  Also, from what I have seen of BB10, there is no doubt that I will like it, unless it just completely sucks other than what they have shown.</p>
<p>Anyways, if RIM adopted Android, there is absolutely NO WAY I would buy another BlackBerry.  If you took the current BlackBerry setup with a better app environment (SDKs, APIs, Graphics, etc&#8230;) BlackBerry would still hold about a 20% market share.  BB10 is going to bring amazing apps with the same business first mentality.  They definitely have a different mindset from the past RIM and should be fine.  Going Android would be the definite end of RIM.</p>
<p>Can you cite your source on the &#8216;creepy&#8217; quote?</p>
<p>Actually the ONLY company that actually turns a profit selling Android phones is Samsung.. HTC posted a lost last quarter&#8230; and they have warned the same for next quarter too.. i guess RIM could join the party of companies not making money on Android, but I think they are not THAT stupid.. I think RIM has realized that they need to get BB10 an new phone done so that they will have something to show people and they are a salable company before they they go bankrupt.. I think they understand they have about another year or so left.. they need to get their shit together so they can sell the company..</p>
<p>I agree I hope they get their shit together. QNX is a good platform its like programing a computer its rather easy.</p>
<p>thank you for finally putting this in words for me. You are a godsend.</p>
<p>How is it embarrassing? BB10 looks like it&#8217;s being really well build and is much more secure and stable then Android (and iOS) are, plus why go to Android when they&#8217;ve already adopted the platform within QNX?</p>
<p>Some people are juvenile enough to still engage in Android/WP/Apple/BB fanboy wars.</p>
<p>You can overview its security and stabillity from these pictures? Without ever having used the device, or anyone having used a device with this OS installed on it? Wow&#8230; You sir truely are the next evolution of mankind.</p>
<p>Now while I don&#8217;t believe he can make any claim even if he did have the device, nowhere does he claim that he gets that opinion from the pictures you know.. he could&#8217;ve been a dev with the dev phone or something else.</p>
<p>Well, considering this is based off the same kernal as the PlayBook, I would say that there is a very good chance that he has used this OS before.  The UI and Dev Tools are far more advanced than the PB OS, but the security will be pretty similar.</p>
<p>PB OS did get rooted which is a little concern, but the root didn&#8217;t actually give it any access to anything secure.  It just allowed the user to change icons and colors and stuff like that.  And, I believe you needed to be in Development mode to install the root which isn&#8217;t possible without a password (if a password is enabled).</p>
<p>Also, with all data probably still going through RIM&#8217;s NOC, the data will be as secure as it always has been.</p>
<p>I own a playbook which uses the same OS on the Developer device and i can tell you its far more secure than any other OS out there.</p>
<p>My Playbook once opened without lockscreen right into an open spreadsheet. Secure hey?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also unstable as hell. The UI uses endless amounts of vague icons without labels.</p>
<p>I never had this problem.</p>
<p>WHOA&#8230;Awesome idea, bro!</p>
<p>Yeah, cause multiple companies competing is just bad for consumers.</p>
<p>What? I think this looks <em>better</em> than Play Music. The OS as a whole is looking quite nice.</p>
<p>Well most is stolen/copied from WebOS a little from Meego/Harmattan.  Android &#8220;contributed&#8221; very little.<br />
Nothing wrong as long as the software works better.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re definitely on a backfoot. I think their hardware and software is still terrible. And the longer they take the farther they need to go to catch up.<br />
I&#8217;m all for some competition, you never know they might surprise us, however&#8230;.</p>
<p>It still annoys me to see younger people buying Blackberry under the mis-guided concept of &#8220;quality&#8221;, yeah its more affordable than an iPhone in the UK, but they&#8217;d have a 100% better experience with Android. I wish people would wake up and see Blackberry for what it is&#8230;.</p>
<p>In Indonesia Blackberry is like crazy.<br />
Everybody though it is an elegant and high quality phone.<br />
Come on guys, wake up!</p>
<p>Are you serious? Comparatively, perhaps, but the Android user experience is a bag of shit. Matias Duarte has started to put things right but it&#8217;s still a horrible clunky mess that&#8217;s flawed by design.</p>
<p>Stock Android 4 is amazing. I guess the hardware and skins can often let it down</p>
<p>BlackBerrys are selling like hot-cakes here in T&amp;T as well. They&#8217;ve been trying an android push, but it hasn&#8217;t been very hard in my opinion. Plus the BlackBerrys are far cheaper, and they like the data plans.</p>
<p>are you serious &#8230;it annoys you that other people  are buyin a device that they like and it is quality for what it does well communicate. it probably the best communications device. you should be happy if people are happy with what they have besides competition is best for us all</p>
<p>The BB Bold 9930 has some of the nicest looking and feeling hardware available.</p>
<p>As for software, sure it&#8217;s not sexy, but the core apps are FAST!  Opening Twitter, Facebook, BBM, Email, or Text message apps are instantanious.  My iPhone 4S takes a few seconds to open any of those apps (they may seem instant, but they load a picture before the app is actually usable).</p>
<p>What are horrible about the current BB&#8217;s are the development tools.  They truly are terrible, but ask any dev familiar with BB10&#8217;s tools and they will tell you they are equal to or better than any other dev tools available.  They offer many options and allow for easy programming of complex code.</p>
<p>I have a friend who once threw his BB at a car by accident. The phone survived and is still working, the only other phone I know that could survive the impact is a Nokia 3310. BBs also have notoriously long battery lives and not to mention still (I think) the fastest email receiving device. So yeah what constitutes quality? My dad has a Samsung Galaxy and after using it for a year he&#8217;s still confused about things. My LG Optimus 7 has been smashed around so much but everything is still working fine both on the hardware and software fronts. And I know that the iPhones have the best cameras around period. So a 100% better experience is a bit of an arbitrary term. I had an awesome time playing around with Android phones but I love my WP7 to death.  So don&#8217;t be biased not everyone is going to enjoy Android or BBOS or iOS or WP7 or Bada or what have you =.=&quot;</p>
<p>Holo-esque? Seems more like what we&#8217;ve had on the Playbook since last year&#8230;<br />
<img src="http://tabtimes.com/ckfinder/userfiles/images/BlackBerry%20PlayBook/IMG_00000011.jpg" /></p>
<p>Stop it. You&#8217;ll confuse the haters with facts..  :P</p>
<p>Nice to see you here Bla1ze</p>
<p>Microsoft JUST BUY RIM ALREADY</p>
<p>Its not worth it</p>
<p>I agree. At least they have a niche unlike Nokia.</p>
<p><img src="http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n81/bigguysuff/22033994.jpg" /></p>
<p>Whoa&#8230;</p>
<p>Certainly a few design elements from Android, hope it works out for them though. This OS looks like it could get em a few new users while also keeping die hard blackberry users on board.</p>
<p>Some of these buttons look a lot like their Android counterparts, but it is a bit unfair to say that the app is copying Android look &amp; feel.<br />
For reference, the same screen in the Google Play Music Android app :<br />
<img src="http://i1257.photobucket.com/albums/ii505/randomguy789/Screenshot_2012-06-15-12-52-59.png" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s got some iOS thrown in there too. I find the use of the menu icon weirder that anything else. Someone please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but I haven&#8217;t seen it in any other place than android.</p>
<p>Do you refer to the 3 dots button ?<br />
If so, that is also an asset that I strongly associate with Android.  I don&quot;t think you have to use an entirely new representation for the same concept in different OS.<br />
It feels a bit weird to see that icon used in another OS though, but you don&#8217;t have an infinity of elegant ways to skin an overflow button.<br />
I will wait until the launch of the first BBX phone (or whatever they are calling it now) before I try to form an opinion on that OS. So far we have only seen a few WIP screens.</p>
<p>Windows Phone uses this symbol as well&#8230;</p>
<p>Just had a look  a look at the wp7 guidelines&#8230;Indeed, this design pattern is also used in wp7 !<br />
To be honest I avoid wp7 phones since I hate  Metro&quot;s L&amp;F so I did not notice before that this button is also used in WP7.<br />
That is a pretty good thing in fact, having the same design pattern used in different platform makes it easily recognizable by a wide range of users.</p>
<p>They should&#8217;ve bought meego or webos and be done with it, why on earth would I use something that looks like android when I can use android now and jellybean is coming. makes no sense to me&#8230;.</p>
<p>Looks like Android?  Really?</p>
<p>Wow&#8230;.</p>
<p>why does everyone think that going with android is going to solve everything? Psh&#8230;</p>
<p>Because Blackberry&#8217;s fans are fans of the hardware, first and foremost. If they did it right, combining their hardware with Ice Cream Sandwich, providing access to Google Play, and porting their own apps like BBM, they could potentially maintain their fan base as well as bringing in Android users. There are a lot of Android users crying out for a decent qwerty keyboard, and a lot of Blackberry users crying out for a stronger app ecosystem. It could potentially be their saving grace. On the other hand, they might be able to blow everyone away with their new range and finally produce a strong 3rd competitor in the mobile market.</p>
<p>Whatever RIM is doing right now, I just can&#8217;t see them surviving the next 2 years. This year has been bleak enough for them and now with SGS3 going global at a really staggering rate and iPhone 5 release near their BB10 launch date, I wish them the best.</p>
<p>People have been saying RIM won&#8217;t last 2 years since early 2009.  Well, I guess those people were wrong&#8230;.</p>
<p>Those words must also apply to Nokia and every other OEM with sinking sales</p>
<p>I hate agenda driven fan-boi journalists.</p>
<p>If BB10 is Holo-inspired isn&#8217;t Android iOS inspired?  Isn&#8217;t iOS BlackBerry or Palm inspired?  Aren&#8217;t those Windows inspired?</p>
<p>Ultimately everything is XEROX inspired.</p>
<p>BB10 looks very cool and I hope it can overcome the negative press that it will receive regardless of how good it is.</p>
<p>Actually, you are wrong.  The original XEROX was actually iOS inspired.  Don&#8217;t you know, everything ever created is a copy of iOS.  /s</p>
<p>Saying BB10 is Holo-inspired and saying that one or two design elements are Holo-inspired aren&#8217;t really the same thing. Besides, everyone copies everyone else — there&#8217;s nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p>Is everything with a cyan color now going to just be &#8220;Holo inspired&#8221; as if Google is the only company to use Cyan in their UI?</p>
<p>I came here, to this article, to see Apple and Android fanboys continue their fanboyism</p>
<p>Is it just me or does that email app look like a dead ringer for WebOS, specifically the TouchPad?<br />
<img src="http://cdn2.ubergizmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/HP-TouchPad-07.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yeah, when QNX was demoing the Playbook everyone was drawing the WebOS comparisons.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just you lol</p>
<p>Blackberry should just make phones for wp7/wp8 like nokia.  Or use Android&#8230;.</p>
<p>While the Q10 is not for me I&rsquo;m glad to see a proper QWERTY smartphone. I know a lot of people who would enjoy having a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>On top of that, I think it flat out looks better than the Z10.</p>
<p>Z10 is ugllyyyy</p>
<p>The Z10 for sure looks very bulky. Way too much phone going on around the screen for my liking.</p>
<p>Z10 looks like slightly bigger, but much thicker iPhone 5. Yes, the bulkiness.</p>
<p>bezel could def be less, but my guess is its for the gestures?</p>
<p>Seems like it will suffice as a successor to the well entrenched, corporate-issued Blackberry. They need to worry about the growing number of BYOD roll-outs, though.</p>
<p>No kidding.  The university I work at used to be a BlackBerry house for full-time staff, but now that we&rsquo;re just running an Exchange server, we&rsquo;ve opened it up to anything employees feel like using.  Android has a mighty strong presence here now.  Starting to see a few Windows Phones seeping in, though.</p>
<p>Isnt Q10 like an anti ageing facecream&hellip;..? Apt much RIM?</p>
<p>BlackBerry*</p>
<p>Sorry, but how is this a &ldquo;proper qwerty&rdquo; device?  It didn&rsquo;t work for Windows Mobile back in the day (anyone remember the screen being as small as this Q10 and needing a stylus to use the UI), why would it work for RIM, err, I mean BlackBerry?  If it was a slider keyboard, then I would agree.  But this is BlackBerry staying in the past IMO.</p>
<p>The current Bold, which is what I use for work, has an even smaller screen and it works fine as a secondary way to navigate the device.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a proper keyboard. It&rsquo;s a keyboard that forces you to sacrifice screen area. A proper keyboard would slide out from under the screen and give you a full, wide set of keys instead of a pinched set of keys and a smaller screen.</p>
<p>I gotta agree. I tried the portrait qwerty game with the Treo 700w and it was painful due to my big thumbs. Past BB handsets looked just as bad if not worse: I will say that the Q10 keys look larger&hellip;that&rsquo;ll help things out a lot IMO.</p>
<p>I can see why they would want to keep the keyboard for existing customers.  With that awkward squareish aspect ratio, Im unsure how well it will handle modern smart phone functions.</p>
<p>The OS is theirs, so I&rsquo;m sure the UX is customized to that specific 1:1 aspect ratio form factor. I am wondering how third party apps will run on it, seeing as how the Z10 is your normal 16:9.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/GZ5CD5r.gif" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/GZ5CD5r.gif</a></p>
<p>Honestly, I like the form factor a lot, but wouldn&rsquo;t even think about buying something that&rsquo;s BB10 until we see if it&rsquo;s got any momentum whatsoever.  I desperately miss having a hardware keyboard, having been on Treos, and then the old Q9, and then Pres, and then a Venue Pro.  However, I can&rsquo;t say that I miss it enough to immediately jump into something with an uncertain future, I&rsquo;ve done that too many times in the past, and like the operating system I&rsquo;m using now.</p>
<p>And plus (sorry, thought of this too late to edit the original post)&hellip; we have zero clue of any hardware specs of it; if Blackberry is anything like every other company, the keyboard one will be decidedly midrange.</p>
<p>Blackberry isn&rsquo;t anything like every other company, though. Their Bold keyboard models have always been their highest specced devices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the keyboard one will be decidedly midrange.bq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mid-range compared to what? I ditched by BB 2 years ago, but trust me, the keyboard is honestly the one thing that might bring me back. I&rsquo;ve used keyboards on 3 BB models and 3-4 Android/Windows Phone models. BB leads the pack there easily&hellip;the closest to a good non-BB keyboard I used was the HTC Desire Z (G2) and the Samsung Blackjack from way back in 2007. But every BB keyboard I&rsquo;ve used was basically perfect, with the Bold 9000 being the best of them all.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean that the keyboard itself would be.  I&rsquo;m saying that if past history by most companies over the past 5 years is anything to go by, the hardware specs of the keyboard model will be mid-range, not the keyboard itself.  I&rsquo;m sure the keyboard itself is excellent.</p>
<p>The downside is that if everybody waits to see whether BB10 gains momentum before joining, there will be no momentum because nobody joins because everyone is waiting for someone else to join.</p>
<p>Just sayin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine, because as I mentioned, other than the lack of a keyboard, I&rsquo;m happy with where I am now.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://d35lb3dl296zwu.cloudfront.net/uploads/photo/image/9896/DSC_1045.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Gotta be honest; this phone looks great.</p>
<p>Would you be willing to sacrifice screen size for it, though? I think the screen is simply too small. And this is coming from someone who believes anything above 4.3" is too big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not for me, but it still looks nice, and would be my top choice if I were looking for a simple phone.</p>
<p>First, I think only old-school BB diehards and corporate IT buyers are the target market for this. That said, lots of consumers now use 7-10 inch tablets, on which you can generally do better quality work than a smartphone (excl. the Note 2). The BB Playbook actually syncs with existing BBs so you can view documents stored on the BB on the Playbook, and edit them using the BB physical keyboard.</p>
<p>I actually agree.</p>
<p>It looks like the perfect thing for Blackberry users. I guess we don&rsquo;t have concrete specs, but the display is high quality, build looks great, larger battery (probably important to keep BB&rsquo;s unparalleled battery life), and LTE is competitive.</p>
<p>Unparalleled? It gets the same battery life as other major smartphones out now. About a day.</p>
<p>Oh dear lord&hellip; and designing this took so long.<br />
That form factor is not a future of qwerty devices.</p>
<p>This phone is for the business crowd who cling to that form factor like a squirrel to a nut.</p>
<p>I wish they&rsquo;d change the shape. It looks OK, but the Z10 looks much more modern, whereas this is still shaped like the 2008 Bold 9000. I mean, it&rsquo;s basically their big hit phone, and since this is targeted at the traditional BB market, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be cutting edge.</p>
<p>The business crowd want iphones and galaxies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be hard for developers to tailor their apps for both the Q10&rsquo;s square aspect ratio and the Z10. This device might end up fragmenting their ecosystem before it even builds up.</p>
<p>2 devices don&#8217;t fragment an ecosystem.</p>
<p>The different resolutions do. Developers now have to repurpose their UI to account for much less screen space.</p>
<p>So&hellip; They changed their name from RIM to BlackBerry and forgot to tell the guys that create the videos?<br />
The end of it still says &lsquo;Research in Motion 2013&rsquo;.<br />
+1 for communication skills.</p>
<p>Unless the name change has been cleared with the board, changed on their incorporation documents, updated with their trademarks and cleared with the SEC and other regulators, they have to keep using the Research in Motion name.</p>
<p>Oh look, another company trying to build its own platform from the ground up to face off against Android and iOS&hellip;. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll enjoy the successes of Palm, Microsoft and Nokia&hellip;.</p>
<p>God forbid anybody try to do anything ever.</p>
<p>Best comment I&rsquo;ve seen in a while.</p>
<p>For individuals who spend most of their time messaging (email, SMS, BBM, status updates, tweets, IM, etc.), this device will be perfect. It&rsquo;ll be good for business users, as well as for messaging fanatics who want the capability of the full internet, but don&rsquo;t value it over messaging. I think this device will sell well, and given what we&rsquo;ve seen from BB10, this OS looks like a winner too. WP8 is the real loser today, IMO.</p>
<p>I actually like this device.</p>
<p>This looks good to me.  Hopefully things catch.</p>
<p>Whats nice about this entire thing (assuming the phone runs well, has no hangups, zero freezing) is you can have the option of having a phone that is a completely separate device, and not a small tablet that makes phone calls.  Meaning tablets have a specific use now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve missed high quality hardware keyboards for some time.  I may very well consider this on that alone, but I&rsquo;m going to have to see a bit more, and I&rsquo;ll have to see if this product&rsquo;s success convinces other companies to throw us keyboard fans a bone here or there.</p>
<p>Great to see this phone in reality and great because (hopefully) it will force the Android fraternity to get to grips with providing QWERTY phones for the masses. It is not <em>always</em> all about beating the iPhone&hellip;</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t it 5 row?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that would affect the one handed usability of the touchscreen.</p>
<p>Any idea when is the release date for the Q10? is it the same as Z10?</p>
<p>To any of the idiots in this comment section talking crap, please show me any other competitor that makes a QWERTY device even close to the 9900??</p>
<p>Talking crap, please sit down. BlackBerry makes the best QWERTY devices. Period.</p>
<p>Love my BB Keyboard.</p>
<p>I prefer Nokia&rsquo;s keyboards, but this will do.</p>
<p>I would buy one today if i could, but its not out till April. This news has really pissed me off.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re about to find out if there&rsquo;s the market for this phone that there once was. If apps are not built for this specific resolution will they even be available? Or will they run the version for full touch screen devices, and have them look horribly?</p>
<p>Personally, if I was going to go back to a Blackberry, this is the one I would choose over the full touch one. Carry this as my phone and a 7" or so tablet for everything else.</p>
<p>Yup, using E71 and N7 at the mo. Q10 would be the perfect upgrade.</p>
<p>And as I still miffed at myself for buying the Blackberry Storm, there is no way I would touch the Z10. I know I should let bygones be bygones, but NO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll wait for the Torch-series device</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still using a Desire Z (the one with the hardware keyboard) with an ICS ROM as my daily driver. I bought it because i always had QWERTY phones, prefer messaging to calls, and didn&rsquo;t want a phone without physical input.</p>
<p>But still, my next phone will be screen-only. Screen input has come a long way, and i barely use the keyboard anymore. With a physical keyboard you&rsquo;re either sacrificing screen real estate or you&rsquo;re adding additional weight to the phone.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get my wrong, that&rsquo;s just my personal experience. There are still people who prefer a QWERTY keyboard, and a few enterprise users want to stick to it, too. But i don&rsquo;t think these are numerous enough to save BlackBerry.</p>
<p>This is my next!</p>
<p>Sure I wish it was coming sooner rather than later in the US, but I&rsquo;m quite excited to have the Q10 in my hand.</p>
<p>So what if I want to type in Russian? WTF? Really, innovation?</p>
<p>It has been a while since I&rsquo;ve owned a BB.  Had a Droid X and now a Galaxy Note 2, but I want this, in a way.  Nothing really truly replaces touch typing on those keyboards.</p>
<p>Hm. I gotta be honest, this is alluring. Now that I have a tablet, my phone has been going untouched besides for texting&hellip;</p>
<p>I love it. I hope this is successful.</p>
<p>Dear TheVerge/David, <br />
There is a thing called &lsquo;tech specs&rsquo; of a gadget. Especially in current generation of mobile phones, info on battery mAh, processor, ram, ports, camera does add value and make article look interesting and informative.</p>
<p>I guess TheVerge realise this and would improve in this area of reporting. As a reader I don&rsquo;t enjoy reading half baked articles on a newly launched phone.</p>
<p>Thank-you.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that information has been released. <span class="caps">STFU</span>.</p>
<p>^^The <span class="caps">STFU</span> is utterly uncalled for, and your argument that the tech specs weren&rsquo;t made available on official launch is uninformed.<br />
Check gsmarena where they got all tech specs available.</p>
<p>Also, TheVerge should notice that their ill- informed rude interns can&rsquo;t bully the readers with their idiotic replies and shoot from the hip language attitude.</p>
<p>Reminds me a lot of Meego. And that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p>Really? It reminds me of the homescreens on 90%+ of smartphones out today.</p>
<p>The article is not showing the real BlackBerry 10 app tray, that is a placeholder.</p>
<p>Here is the real deal:<br />
<img src="https://p.twimg.com/As8Hr1pCIAILOVT.png:large" /></p>
<p>The three screens for multitasking, app tray, and notifications is a ripoff of Meego. And the whole swipe UI was implemented in Meego.</p>
<p>It seems that way because The Astonishing Tribe (TAT), now RIM Sweden originally worked on some of the meego project. Like some one mentioned above, not at all bad.</p>
<p>See here&#8230;they have tons of videos up&#8230;<a href="http://youtu.be/PrdrBefMAEc" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/PrdrBefMAEc</a></p>
<p>There is a typo in the article, you swipe right-to-left to get to the messaging hub and left-to-right to get to the application tray. That arrangement certainly seems similar to the N9&#8217;s three homescreen concept.</p>
<p>fixed</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>No problem!</p>
<p>13:37PM eh?</p>
<p>Good point. I would have expected 12:97.</p>
<p>Well done. Really.<br />
It&#8217;s either 13:37(as in 1:37 pm) or, you know, 1:37 pm. There&#8217;s no such thing as 13:37 pm.</p>
<p>I was more referencing the &#8220;1337&#8221; time coincidence, or possible troll&#8230; which considering narcan&#8217;s point of multiple weather icons make me curious as to the source of the pic&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh right, I also thought you were saying that 13:37PM is not a valid time (as Khalid points out).</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s possible the &#8216;leet&#8217; time is no coincidence given Apple are known for including significance into their product shot clock times, can imagine Blackberry would want to also follow lead there.</p>
<p>Looks&#8230;clustered. They should make the icons a bit smaller.</p>
<p>I agree, it makes the screen look a lot smaller.</p>
<p>It might have something to do with the wallpaper, too.</p>
<p>Looks the same as everything else. It&#8217;s going to have to try hard to impress me. Granted, there&#8217;s not any other amazing way to do it that I can think of, but still.</p>
<p>More interested in B2G because everything is HTML5 which is awesome concept. We&#8217;ll see how it shapes up in the end.</p>
<p>Those multiple weather icons seem redundant. They should be replaced with more Calendar icons.</p>
<p>To be serious for a moment, if that homescreen means that they&#8217;ve only got 4 apps in a demo-able state then Blackberry are in big trouble if they intend to release by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.savagechickens.com/"><img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/20pesms.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>crapp tray more like it</p>
<p>It&#8217;s got ALL KINDS of weather.</p>
<p>An icon grid, how original, someone should get sued ;)</p>
<p>Whatever. Blackberry is so needed. Get the stuff out on the shelves so I can cop it!!!!!</p>
<p>What do you miss about Blackberry that you can&#8217;t already get from Android or iOS?</p>
<p>I can answer that:  The notification system (Silent LED); quick, customizable, and easy to change sound profiles; physical keyboard; excellent multitasking; stability; keyboard shortcuts; long battery life; real push email; security; personal dictionary with user defined word substitutions (e.g. type &#8220;ima&#8221; followed by space bar &amp; it automatically fills in what you defined it to type.  Example: ima = &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t take you call at the moment.  I am in a meeting.  I will give you a call as soon as I am finished&#8221;) ; cross integration between apps, calendar conference call feature including access code and participants.  I could go on and on, but I&#8217;m getting long in the tooth.<br />
I have left BB and found I was miserable.  There are different manufacturers for different people.  Each platform has its strengths and weaknesses.  My needs may be different than yours.  I don&#8217;t watch movies or play games on my phone.  I acknowledge the ecosystem is lacking when it comes to those things, but when it comes to functions I need to get stuff done there is no living without my BB.  It may not be the phone for you (that is fine), but understand not everyone has the same needs and desires.</p>
<p>P.S.  Did I mention BBM (probably didn&#8217;t need to!)</p>
<p>That is it.  What some like or need is different than what others want or need.  BlackBerry works excellent for me.  I love all my RIM devices.</p>
<p>My Galaxy S II does all of that out-of-the-box, of course not necessarily in the exact same manner as a RIM device, I assume.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about all those other points (most seem to be on Android and iOS already), but &#8220;real push email&#8221; is just silly.</p>
<p>Please explain to us what makes BB push email &#8220;real&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Real push&#8221; means that messages are automatically sent to your device regardless of service (email provider).  On a Blackberry ALL your email accounts are push.  On other devices some are, but others still poll (think Yahoo on Android for example).</p>
<p>While each manufacturer has one (or even a few) of the attributes I mentioned above, none have all of them on one device and out of the box.  Furthermore, they don&#8217;t do them with the degree of ease that RIM does, in my experience and opinion.</p>
<p>I am not speaking ill of any other OS.  I&#8217;m simply stating that there is not a best OS, just best for you.  For some of us that is BlackBerry.  For many, many, many others it is Android and iOS.  I have articulated why I need a Blackberry.  You are free to choose another device.  I wouldn&#8217;t even begin to persuade you to purchase a BB unless I thought it was right for you, but to dismiss BlackBerry as a viable platform, though, is&#8230;.well&#8230;&#8230;. &#8220;just silly.&#8221;  (Not to mention super trendy!)</p>
<p>I dont know about the other things but you do have user defined shortcuts in iOS. Define the shortcuts and type the shorter form and hit the space bar, it does the job for you.</p>
<p>The physical keyboard is a big plus&#8230;for some.</p>
<p>That guy really likes his music,weather,pictures and calendars 
<p>Lol, the status bar is literally the iOS layout reversed.</p>
<p>The status bar is in an almost identical order as existing blackberry devices&#8230;</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Some people care about seeing what companies are going to try to bring to the market, rather than just writing them off before seeing what they have to show. Some people like to encourage companies to continue to try rather than act pessimistic and restrict change in order to perpetuate the status quo.</p>
<p>I think the odd part is that the person &#8220;can&#8217;t wait&#8221;<br />
It would be one thing to say, oh yeah, I&#8217;d like to see how the final product feels&#8230; but has there been enough information about the product that would make some one extremely impatient about the release of a blackberry device?</p>
<p>Absolutely!  The whole flow of the OS is awesome.  Apps are one thing, and BB10 will struggle with that until developers start to fully support it, but the OS itself is without a doubt the most intuitive OS I have seen.   I like iOS and Android, but I don&#8217;t think their stock OSes  come anywhere near BB10 in terms of functionality and flow.</p>
<p>iOS is almost 100% a basic app launcher, which is great for a lot of people. And also great because there are tons of apps.  However, I am left wanting more from the OS when I&#8217;m using an iPad or iPhone.  With BB10, I expect to be wanting more in terms of apps, but I think the OS will fulfill my needs from an OS perspective.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, what do you expect to do with your operating system besides run programs?</p>
<p>To be secure, have good built in apps, be intuitive, not to crash, good at multitasking, efficient with available hardware&#8230; you know&#8230; the kinda stuff that makes a good operating system on any device.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Aw SCHNAP</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen anything new from RIM yet in Blackberry 10&#8230; to me it seems like yet another touch operating system with no apps.</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s exactly what it is.</p>
<p>Another touch operated OS with no apps, but with great security.</p>
<p>Well i&#8217;m assuming Playbook apps will be available on the platform and they&#8217;ve got a nice amount of apps available these days.</p>
<p>Actually just read NitroFlir&#8217;s comment below&#8230;</p>
<p>Considering you have only seen demos of the beta and they are holding their cards to their chest, not surprising. If you still feel this way after January 30th, then your comment has more validility.</p>
<p>In regards to no apps, can I get your source because it has been reported repeatedly that they already have over 70,000  plus apps for launch with more coming since the SDK went Gold?</p>
<p>By no apps I mean a severly lacking app selection, yet another platform launching with promises and a wish for developer to magically start developping from scratch for it. I have seen the previews and judging by what already has been shown I just haven&#8217;t seen that killer feature that will turn people over from iOS or Android. Even Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone efforts have the Office support as a selling point and the tight Xbox live/Exchange integration.</p>
<p>I guess my question is, why should i buy a BB10 device, why, as a developer, should I spend my time and money investing in this new ecosystem?</p>
<p>First you should inform yourself. You should read about financial incentives RIM has put forward ( <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2991956/rim-developers-10k-guarantee" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2991956/rim-developers-10k-guarantee</a> ). Then you should look at how Android apps can be easlily repackaged (even by a layman, here <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android/</a> ). Then you should read about RIM using TomTom as a data provider for some content i.e. navigation-poi, or their camera app embedding Scalado software etc. I guess my question is why a dev would resort to speculating instead of reading the docs&#8230; do you speculate on what you can do with Haskell before reading about it. Please.</p>
<p>schooled</p>
<p>That is all still NOTHING! Look at Microsoft, they have the world of developer incentives, They have Nokia&#8217;s NavteQ as their Location Platform, Nokia OWNS that same Scalado tech that RIM is making use of and WP is still fighting to gain share (Which I&#8217;m super confident it will catch fire by the nook or by the crook). RIM is in much dire straits. And yes BlackBerry&#8217;s 3rd party apps are severly lacking! More-so than some of Windows Phone&#8217;s worst apps.</p>
<p>It is not nothing, but I see where you&#8217;re coming from. I just think it takes time. I don&#8217;t have a crystal ball, but I believe RIM has more experience distributing and selling phones than Microsoft. As far as apps are concerned, yes, not all ecosystems are equal clearly, but I don&#8217;t believe changing those trends require besting the sheer number of apps. It&#8217;s still early in the game, and some came to play much earlier and got a headstart. But in 3-5-10 years&#8230; who knows? Microsoft is a startup in the phone business, because it is still,  for the moment, a phone business&#8230; For RIM it&#8217;s an uphill battle too, it&#8217;s just different. Time will tell.</p>
<p>Good response. The time thing is key. I also believe there is room for both RIM and MSFT to upturn the market.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think office is a real seller for phones. Its been three years for windows phone and it still hasn&#8217;t had traction at all. I think that blackberry has a better chance than windows phone just because of how many blackberry users there were at one time. Blackberry still has mind share over wp. And with the latest example being that they shipped 7 million smart phones without putting out any new hardware for months. In comparison to windows phone 8 it has been circulating that it has shipped 4 million in the past couple months averaging about 2 million a month which is what rim is averaging with no new hardware. Too me that&#8217;s meaningful , it shows rim still has some relevance in the market where as windows phone is continuing to struggle gaining mind share.</p>
<p>Be sure to distinguish shipped units and sold units. Android has 75% market share in shipped units. The numbers of actual phones used are much much different (source latest IDC report).</p>
<p>To Nitroflr: do you believe that a $10,000 guarantee is enough to pursuade quality developers to switch to BB10? And do you think that indie developers are shooting for $10,000 gross sales? What will that cover? Not to mention that in order to even qualify the app has to be quality certified with whatever that vague term means.</p>
<p>Secondly, I will grant you that this Android &#8594; Blackberry repackaging will boost the numbers RIM will tout at launch. Have you actually used these repackaged Android apps on the Playbook? I have and they are mostly terrible, performance is horrid, not to mention lack of optimisation. Nothing beats a native app and you have to agree with that.</p>
<p>binglut9&#8217;s point that Blackberry has somewhat of a following given the platforms old successes, and that will give it a boost ( I for one have a cousin that refuses to upgrade his Bold 9700 until BB10) will that be enough to kick RIM back into gear? Remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Read the terms here, it&#8217;s in writing: <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/commitment/" target="_blank">https://developer.blackberry.com/builtforblackberry/commitment/</a> &#8211; I note that they recommend submitting before Jan. 11 2013. It&#8217;s 1000$ that the app needs to earn in order for them to pay the difference etc. So it&#8217;s not random. Besides, I would believe many contemporary devs to be entrepreneurs who will consider a business opportunity. Even more so when people complain about the lack of such and such an app in the <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/appworld" target="new">appworld</a> &#8220;ecosystem&#8221;, which I thought was still <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/whyblackberry/" target="new">successful</a> for some devs. Well that means that there&#8217;s space in that market maybe&#8230;</p>
<p>A Playbook user will experience BB10 too from what I know, and yes I&#8217;ve used apps in the Android runtime, including Google Maps (sideloaded clearly) and other flagship apps, because it&#8217;s often about those few apps that people really want and the OS feature set. Although it is a runtime, I was actually suprised at how functional it was in many instances. I wouldn&#8217;t rely on that entirely but it&#8217;s no gimmick either. Besides do other manufacturers allow you to &#8220;emulate&#8221; another platform and integrate it in their store?? Is it really costly to repackage an existing app and make it accessible to more people? There&#8217;s even an Eclipse <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/tools/" target="new">plugin</a> for you. I&#8217;m not stupid;  some devs are becoming greater stakeholders in some ecosystems &#8211; their business model becomes tied with a brand. My experience is that with time, all can be done and undone. But I&#8217;ve seen other devs making apps for all platforms. It is really not as grim or perplexing as you put it.</p>
<p>And Happy Holidays!</p>
<p>Might as well go full circle and say that it may not be a Christmas log, but it&#8217;s still <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/develop/platform_choice/ndk.html" target="new">cake</a> with frosting lolll. It seems every time I look at a platform, you can always pretty much use C++, Java etc. I wish someone had something to say to the layman about the differences between those platforms API sets.</p>
<p>If the app is going to run less than optimally then most devs will choose not to offer it for fear of the impact it&#8217;ll have on their reputation.</p>
<p>The Android runtime is just a quick way to have something up and running on that platform with very little effort. If your app is not available on a platform people are using then basically you don&#8217;t have any reputation to those people. I guess you have to try and see if the performance is up to your standard.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s nothing like <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting.html" target="new">porting</a> and I see RIM has put together some info on some API functions <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/bb10/porting_native_ios_android_mapping_2007551_11.html" target="new">mappings</a> vs. IOS/Android on the native side of the sdk&#8230;</p>
<p>Those mindshare users are keypad users. I have seen torch user still use the optical track pad instead of scrolling the touch screen. Will they like to type in this touch screen keyboard? I don&#8217;t think so as this doesn&#8217;t have swipe typing.</p>
<p>Are you some sort of RIM insider that knows which apps are going to be available at launch? I have an iphone and there are maximum 20 apps that i use, only 7 or so of which i would be upset if i didnt have. 70,000 apps can be enough as long as they are the right apps.</p>
<p>May actually pick one up, as a change.<br />
Excited!</p>
<p>Hopefully they keep all the names simple. I don&#8217;t want a z10 turbo lte Max.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, different letter prefixes would signify different form factors (z for flagships, maybe N for keyboards, V for budget, X for slab, etc). Then every 10 increase would be a new generation and in between each 10 could be a carrier modification if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t forget they&#8217;re competing with the HTC One X/S/V/VS, Galaxy series with tons of letter connotations, etc</p>
<p>Deliberate leak I reckon, not a bad idea actually.  By leaking, you build hype and get people to talk about your comeback products, by the time this &#8220;Blackberry Z10&#8221; steps into the ring and touches gloves with iPhone and Galaxy S III, we will already have a &#8220;revenge&#8221; theme, of the old pro coming back to reclaim his rightful title :-)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think BB10 will be enough, I think it&#8217;s too little too late. Microsoft left it too long and are struggling, RIM left it even longer and will struggle even more in my opinion.</p>
<p>RIM have 80m subscribers with one analyst saying that 70% of those surveyed were looking to upgrade.</p>
<p>Most of the CrackBerry faithful have been waiting patiently for this since Q! 2012, that the difference between Windows Phone and Palm.</p>
<p>Presumably they want a physical keyboard, hence they haven&#8217;t yet abandoned ship. Why will they go for a touchscreen? If the first device fails (media and market perception) the second, third and (if they get there) fourth won&#8217;t stand a chance.</p>
<p>I swear they&#8217;re only doing this as a shop window to get bought for patents and IP.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called licensing&#8230; there&#8217;s no need to sell out to people who&#8217;ve lost the touch for innovation really. The launch device makes perfect sense, because there&#8217;s more to this than a freakin keyboard. There&#8217;s also a new OS, and some people are due for a change. Furthermore, the carriers are enthused with the devices, contrary to what you say. Obviously, you need to inform yourself further. Tiny speculation about your gut feeling is what comments are all about, but frankly without a minimum of information, it&#8217;s quite irrelevant.</p>
<p>Ok, so what&#8217;s the deal? They&#8217;re looking to get out of hardware and license their new OS?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3240265/rim-blackberry-10-licensing-testing-final-stages" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/13/3240265/rim-blackberry-10-licensing-testing-final-stages</a></p>
<p>&#8216;Why will they go for a touchscreen?&#8217;</p>
<p>I, as a current BlackBerry Bold 9900 user who is going for the alltouch BB10 device, may enlighten you here.</p>
<p>The L-Series with BB10 will be the first alltouch multimedia device on the market, where you don&#8217;t have to compromise on integrity, native PC-like features, typing and ease and speed of use. Abandoning a BlackBerry is giving up on many things, not only a hardware keyboard. BB10 combines two worlds.</p>
<p>*especially one-handed use</p>
<p>Thanks for the insight. You clearly are exactly what they&#8217;re looking for in a customer. Good luck and I hope the device is worth the wait.</p>
<blockquote> typing and ease and speed of use</blockquote>
<p>What makes you think the BB10 keyboard will be so much better than iOS/Android/WP8?</p>
<p>1. The keyboard is very wide, uses all of the space, there are no gaps between the keys and the screen is 4.2&quot; with a 1280 : 786 aspect ratio <br />
2. The keyboard adapts to your typing style. When you&#8217;re for example constantly hitting the &#8216;B&#8217; at its very left edge, the keyboard moves the point towards that point<br />
3. It has multilingual (three languages at the same time), user adapting word prediction<br />
4. Predicted words don&#8217;t show up in a line above the keyboard, but right at the button you&#8217;re going to hit next. So instead of constantly glancing at above the keyboard and therefore  getting distracted from accurate typing, I see the predicted words at the spot where I&#8217;m looking at anyway. Is the prediction right, I simply swipe up instead of tap, instead of moving the thumb elsewhere to confirm.<br />
5. I can delete entire words by swiping from the right to the left over the entire keyboard.<br />
6. The keyboard automatically sets spaces between words where I forgot them <br />
7. Because of points 1 and 4 the BB10 is very good at both two-thumb and one-thumb typing in portrait mode</p>
<p>On my Bold 9900 I get speeds of up to 6 letters per second, without any shortcuts, auto-correction or predictive text. I write this text right know on this thing. Kevin Michaluk from CrackBerry said during a podcast that he, as he uses a Bold 9900 like me, is faster on the touchscreen keyboard on the Dev Alpha than on his Bold 9900. It&#8217;s the fastest typing he has ever experienced and that guy has also always used Droids and the iPhone. Especially the last months he uses the competition as his daily driver as an experiment on the road to BB10, also the Lumia 920.</p>
<p>Now, what I want to have, is a wide, good keyboard for convenient and fast two-thumb-typing without any predictive text and help and a good, accurate and convenient keyboard with predictive text and auto-correction when in cases I&#8217;m on the go for example and I want to type one-handed.</p>
<p>I also tried out the much-loved swype-keyboard on Android. You swipe from key to key (which is unbelievable inconvenient when handling the phone in one hand), then you check if it has it right, then you go on with the next word. Swipe &#8211; check &#8211; swipe &#8211; check &#8211; correct &#8211; swipe &#8211; check &#8211; NO THANKS.</p>
<p>I have no idea what that second paragraph means. It sounds an awful lot like a press release, though.</p>
<p>And the Nevada will come with a 720&#215;720 screen with a keyboard. Happy?</p>
<p>Just about anyone still rocking a BB is doing so because it has a physical keyboard. This launch device make no sense. Unless they REALLY believe they&#8217;ve come from nowhere and bettered Google and Apple&#8230;. which is frankly idiotic. iOS and Android have some weak spots sure, but they are small and even filling those perceived holes, wouldn&#8217;t be enough to get a foothold in the touchscreen smartphone market. MS are finding it a monumental task and they have all sorts of leverage to help them in their battle.</p>
<p>They should have put all their eggs into the physical keyboard market, one in which their brand reputation is second to none. This plan can&#8217;t end well. Sorry. It&#8217;s not even like the carriers care about them sticking around.</p>
<p>This is only the first device. BB10 devices with physical keyboards are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>One thing that I think could seriously help RIM is retaining the ability to run Android apps, like the Playbook could do.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you think they should have just focussed on their one true talent &#8211; smartphones with physical keyboards? Do they have the resources to develop tow devices and the software that they&#8217;ll require (OS, API&#8217;s etc)?</p>
<p>Just seems like a unnecessary distraction for Blackberry.</p>
<p>I believe it&#8217;s a necessary distraction. Touch is where it&#8217;s at. Physical keyboards will be available for people who want or need them. This is the halo product I would think, with the workmanlike products soon to follow.</p>
<p>They tried this, and failed. People want touch screens. You cannot survive without making them.</p>
<p>The carriers actually care immensely about them sticking around. Do your homework.</p>
<p>Where do you get that? Provide sources if you&#8217;re going to make that claim.</p>
<p>For instance, this <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/19/3783530/rim-blackberry-10-o2-vodafone-ee-availability-uk" target="new">article</a> on the Verge published days ago or <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2012/11/01/rim-surges-as-carriers-test-bb10-devices/" target="new">this</a>.</p>
<p>You guy have no clue, it&#8217;s a shame. Talking about things you don&#8217;t know anything about.</p>
<p>If you paid attention, over 150 carriers are excited about BB10. They want a third option.</p>
<p>Looks like they will finally deliver a complete phone, just a couple years to late.</p>
<p>The problem I see is were in an ecosystem world and BB has little to offer compared to google apple and amazon.</p>
<p>I could buy this phone but it would be so disconnected from everything else. All my google services, my apple hardware and iOS.</p>
<p>You are speculating (hey, that&#8217;s what the Internet is for!) &#8211; I would bet they have pretty great Google services integration, along with the required Facebook, Twitter and whatever else is de rigueur.</p>
<p>Dieter talked about this (I think it was him) on a Mobile Vergecast not so long ago. He wasn&#8217;t particularly sold on the demo&#8217;s he saw, but he did say he was hoping they come good.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the problem. I hear all Mobileshows and Vergecasts and all the Verge team is constantly doing, is making fun of RIM. That is why they don&#8217;t even recognize a good thing when it&#8217;s sitting right on the top of their nose. You shouldn&#8217;t have one blog as your only source.</p>
<p>I saw the demos, videos and read many pieces from different sources about BB10 after Jam Americas in september. And many people &#8211; me included &#8211; were blown away and very excited. Then I tuned into the Verge Mobilshow and also the aftercoming Vergecast and couldn&#8217;t believe what I heard. Dieter said that active frames are simply like WP Live Tiles, the gesture to peek into the inbox or to change between personal and work are &#8216;weird&#8217; and that the overall OS is like a mashup of Android, WP and iOS. The Verge team was just poking fun.</p>
<p>The point is, the Verge team is just NOT interested in anything BlackBerry. And therefore they don&#8217;t even try to figure out what this really is all about. In fact, BB10 &#8211; although not revealed completely &#8211; is by now already more feature-complete than iOS or Windows Phone, talking native. And it IS pretty unique. And for the gestures, these aren&#8217;t weird at all, that are gestures you have to learn once and then go for it, they&#8217;re natural and they do make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>And the same goes for most of the commenters here. They have absolutely no clue. And they have no clue, because they&#8217;re simply not interested at all. I even read crap like &#8216;cheap and low-budget Androids and Windows Phones outperform BlackBerrys in every functional and nonfunctional way&#8217;. You know what? That&#8217;s absolute crap. They have bigger screens with higher resolutions and more apps (if crap apps or not). That&#8217;s it. But there are still things BBs can do natively Droids and especially WPs can&#8217;t and I don&#8217;t talk business or security here. And they&#8217;re much faster and more convenient to use when you know how to handle them.</p>
<p>As for The Verge team, I&#8217;d like to see them either do more unbiased research on BB10 and its features or let it slip completely. But I can&#8217;t read and especially hear this halfbaked crap anymore, fun here, fun there. And as for the commenters: simply shut the hell up if you have no clue what&#8217;s going on or coming up.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I thought I was the only one that felt this way. Agree with the entire comment. I don&#8217;t see why people <strong>want</strong> RIM to fail. More competition is good.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I admit my view has mostly been coloured by what i&#8217;ve heard around the net. <br />
Used to love my old BB (Blueberry) back in the day. I have nothing against them. I frequently see some of their active users, who still love their BB&#8217;s, so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s confusing to see them go the way of iOS / Android when they have something quite unique and loved by some.</p>
<p>Interesting times.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m absolutely into BlackBerry and therefore I know what I&#8217;m talking about and I know the differences between BBs and the competition. First, I&#8217;m a 100% communications guy (4 mail adresses at 3 different providers all instantly pushed, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, BBM, SMS, MMS if necessary, Visual Voicemail). Communication comes first. Secondly, I read many blogs, news services and am an active forums member in different places. I listen to music and audiobooks (567 tracks combined), take, edit and share pictures from time to time (1,101 Pics on my phone currently), am subscribed to multiple audio- and videopodcasts (15 subscriptions). I use Office (DocsToGo) and Dropbox, Wunderlist, take notes, use tasks and calendar. I listen to international radio stations via TuneIn, track songs with Shazam and purchase them through Amazon MP3 or 7Digital. I navigate directions via BB and Google maps, check POIs via Wikitude (AR) and Qype, I open a mobile hotspot when required, use NFC Tags and Bluetooth. And I do all this things with my outdated BlackBerry. But the best thing is that it&#8217;s super convenient and fast to use, even one-handed. I&#8217;m always at top of my info, check things and reply to messages within a blink of an eye. Even sharing, copying, cutting and pasting information is super fast, most apps are well deeply integrated. When Apple announced deep Facebook integration with iOS that was a good laugh for me. Integration I have since years with MOST of my third-party-apps. This device is the best and most efficient tool to me I can currently get. Whatever, it surely has its weaknesses, especially when it comes to video in an extended way, games and all graphics performance related things. A BlackBerry isn&#8217;t that glossy, it just DOES things.</p>
<p>Anyhow, with BB10 I hope I can get exactly this experience WITHOUT its weaknesses and fun apps and games along with rich graphics and performance on top. Today I can get the one thing or the other, not both together. But the thing with BB10 is that I can bust many prejudices that are, as you said, &#8216;coloured by things people hear around the net&#8217;.</p>
<p>Blackberry has never been accused of being unproductive. It has been accused of being unstable (as someone who worked in a major carriers store (where customers came to troubleshoot) I&#8217;ve had a lot more exposure to different models than you) and convoluted.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad that you as a techie are able to use your phone to its fullest potential but selling phones to loyalists and/or techies will not return RIM to profitability. They need the mass consumer. BB10 stands a better chance than anything they currently offer but they need to blow us away, not just match current offerings.</p>
<p>&#8216;so that’s why it’s confusing to see them go the way of iOS / Android when they have something quite unique and loved by some.&#8217;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t adress this point yet. So, this thing is quite simple. Most people buy the things that are more appealing. And surely 500,000 apps along with 3D games on a 4,5+ inch high resolution screen for great web browsing and video are more appealing than text messaging or e-mailing on 2.5 to 2.8 inch. But I bet that at the end of the day, people buy phones mostly because of features they use much less. Well, I for one buy a phone based on the skills it has in terms of those features I use most. But I am also a geek. When my BB has bad battery life, comes along with that bad sand clock, freezes or randomly reboots, I just know that that&#8217;s not normal and what to do know. It&#8217;s a bit like a Windows PC which is much easier to recover. But the thing is that most people simply aren&#8217;t geeks and if they experience problems like that, they think that&#8217;s they way a BB is and they take it as it is and hate it. And that&#8217;s one of the things that will change completely with BB10.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could buy this phone but it would be so disconnected from everything else. All my google services, my apple hardware and iOS.&#8221;</p>
<p>so you cant buy a phone that isnt connected to iOS?</p>
<p>BB10 will have music streaming services, movie streaming services, access to your gmail and google calendar and contacts via CARDdav etc, and app world will have at least 70,000 quality apps to start. what are you complaining about?</p>
<p>and dont forget that unlike iOS, you can download files like mp3s DIRECTLY to the device without &#8220;jailbreaking&#8221;.</p>
<p>Where the hell are you getting that many quality apps? Is every app quality?</p>
<p>That big ass BlackBerry logo on the front is ugly.</p>
<p>you can invest in a sharpie and color over it.</p>
<p>They could give one away with it as a launch offer.</p>
<p>Way to much bezel on this, looks old from start.</p>
<p>the bezel is touch sensitive and aids in gesture recognition, thats why it exists.</p>
<p>There is no ecosystem. It will die.</p>
<p>Silliest term of 2012.</p>
<p>Even when it applies to Windows Phone, no?</p>
<p>DAMN YOU GLOBAL WARMING!!</p>
<p>This is hilarious. +1 One suggestion: use bolding instead of caps. Thanks.</p>
<p>Rectangle with round corners. Black. White. Looks ever so familiar.</p>
<p>Ever so familiar to what?</p>
<p>To modern day smartphones. You see rohetaku, in this day and age, people expect smartphones to all look incredibly different from each other. They cannot be rectangular, have rounded or square corners, or have large screens on the front. perhaps an argyle pattern would suffice? God-forbid smartphones look as similar to eachother as HDTVs do.</p>
<p>Sorry but you fail.</p>
<p>Not at all. I have the impression that we can ditch 3D product development software, in fact product design development altogether, and serve clients with Adobe Illustrator&#8217;s rounded rectangle filter. Mobile device design as a whole could be encoded in a one-click function for all that matters. Time saved. Money saved.</p>
<p>If you are trying to say it looks like the iPhone, this is one of the few phones that, without branding, you can without a doubt discern from an iPhone. I could discern most, but this is blatantly obvious with slightly off color top and bottom. Besides, it is not like this design isn&#8217;t obvious when 2 companies announce similarly designed phones within a year that the proper technology is availible&#8230;</p>
<p>And i want a BlackBerry, said no one ever. Lol jk</p>
<p>I want a BlackBerry</p>
<p>I want a blackberry</p>
<p>Buy one?</p>
<p>I want a BlackBerry.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the Torch, Bold, Curve all for sale. You&#8217;re pleased to buy one :)</p>
<p>I want a BlackBerry</p>
<p>I want a BlackBerry</p>
<p>Meh not cool enough for me.</p>
<p>Wish they would have stuck with the London codename. Z10 sounds awkward.</p>
<p>I agree! Naming it after a series of cities would be pretty cool and much more distinctive.</p>
<p>I want a BlackBerry 10 :D</p>
<p>And the ship sinks a little further down&#8230;</p>
<p>doesn&#8217;t matter how far down it sinks when it&#8217;s already underwater.  ;-[</p>

<p>&#8230;no comments here (until now)</p>
<p>I sense apathy!</p>
<p>Will RIM still be around in late 2012?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be shocked if they are!</p>
<p>RIM shipped 14.1 million handsets this past quarter&#8230; and they posted a profit too.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll be around for a while.</p>
<p>True, we&#8217;ve seen that handset makers can last for years after they stop making a profit.</p>
<p>maybe so but not in their current form.  They&#8217;ve put themselves in the same position as Nokia did</p>
<p>Netflix did in one year what RIM&#8217;s been doing for 4 to 5.</p>
<p>Now they&#8217;re both on track to make measly profits (perhaps even net losses) until late 2012.</p>
<p>I would guess they are entrenched enough in enterprise/government they’ll be around for a while &#8211; though ripe for a takeover, but I’m not sure who would want to inherit that headache.</p>
<p>&#8220;ripe&#8221; for a takeover</p>
<p>i see what u did there&#8230; ;)</p>
<p>maybe for the patents, like google did with motorola.. although that patent acquisition war seems to either have slowed down a bit or we just don&#8217;t see many reports on it anymore..</p>
<p>Yep, patents and user base are valuable. RIM would be a god target for someone. But who? MS were blocked when they looked at it in 2006. Chances are Apple would be as well.</p>
<p>they will, but they will be like the annoying new guy who everyone ignores.</p>
<p>More like the annoying guy who has work there for decades but barely bothers to show up, doesn&#8217;t do any decent work but somehow seems to avoid getting fired.</p>
<p>Even assuming they launch an amazing product, people will be even more entrenched in Android or iOS by then. I dont see them being able to recover the market share they&#8217;ve lost, let alone the market they are going to continue to lose for then next 10 months without a viable competitor in the market. They might as well settle for 4th place behind Windows Phone, assuming they are still around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tempted to say no. And common sense tells me they won&#8217;t. But look what happened to Apple. On the verge of bankruptcy, now the worlds largest CE company. These things can happen!</p>
<p>RIS &#8211; Research In Slowmotion?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s dangerously close to IRS.</p>
<p>That’s dangerously close to IRIS.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s anagram of Siri.</p>
<p>Which is dangerously close to Sirius</p>
<p>Which is a company Apple bought&#8230;</p>
<p>So, Apple will buy RIM? :O</p>
<p>maybe they will put rims on the iCar</p>
<p>Why do even try so hard? Try Research In Molasses.</p>
<p>Running in Molasses.</p>
<p>Way to drop the ball RIM&#8230;</p>
<p>Would you buy a sinking ship?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that what Microsoft does?</p>
<p>If I had right tools and material to stop it sinking, I would. Why is Google buying Motorola (except for patents)?</p>
<p>They just need to give up.  It is only through Microsoft&#8217;s inability to gain traction with WP7 that RIM is still remotely relevant. By the end of 2012, iOS and Android will be so far ahead that RIM won&#8217;t have a prayer with BB10.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just iOS and Android. By the end of 2012, Nokia will also be 12 months into a massive marketing + sales drive.</p>
<p>hence, microsoft, since they make windows phone 7, not nokia.</p>
<p>my thinking exactly</p>
<p>Just by looking at that picture I&#8217;d try one out but I&#8217;ll have a Galaxy Nexus or another NExus phone by that time. If I was ready to switch at the time of the release of BB10 I&#8217;d consider it from the looks and good performance of the PlayBook</p>
<p>The timing can&#8217;t be more inconvenient. By late 2012 there will be a new iPhone with iOS 6 and probably a new set of great Android 5.0 phones. We&#8217;ll see the introduction of a better Metro and some more WP7 handsets. But that&#8217;s obvious. What I mean is that everyone who uses BlackBerry will choose around July 2012 to finally migrate to other ecosystems. So good luck to RIM, they&#8217;ll have to try to win former BB users back&#8230; which won&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a bad mood, so I&#8217;m going to leave a bad comment on a blog.</p>
<p>RIM, it&#8217;s over. You guys had your run, putting out the same device over and over. The business crowd ate them up. Proto-smartphone users, wannabes, and enthusiasts did too. But now? Now? It&#8217;s OVER. Your market share is shit. Your phones are uncool. Your hardcore base is over the keyboard, and the one thing you did well (communications) is being overtaken. iMessage, google chat/talk/voice&#8230; BBM no longer has the cache it enjoyed. And since everyone does push emails now, you don&#8217;t have that either.</p>
<p>The worst part is you have NO VISION. Why the PlayBook? It was a half assed attempt to have a tablet and I wouldn&#8217;t suggest it to a monkey. Your OS is shit. The future will never come for BBX. And I&#8217;m tired of hearing about it. At least Palm had the decency to die in 2 years, you guys will be around for the next 5-10 due to a combo of cash reserves and too much foolish pride. Spin off BBM to somebody. Sell your patents. Retire to British Columbia. Just stop trying, please.</p>
<p>Wow, you must have been in <em>quite</em> a bad mood :D</p>
<p>If it takes a bad mood to get the truth RIM needs more of it..</p>
<p>They sat an watched as they got destroyed by iOS and Android. Seriously what went through their heads? We have a keyboard? Oh and BBM. Not enough guys, it may have been something to desire a few years back but you guys have done nothing in the time. iOS and Android eclipse BB as a whole.</p>
<p>You think having two CEOs means they&#8217;d have twice the chance of avoiding a disaster. Instead they are both equally stupid and arrogant.</p>
think having two CEOs means they’d have twice the chance of avoiding a disaster.[/quote]
<p>What fool would think that?  After the last decade,  &#8220;overseen by the CEO&#8221; should be a worse insult than &#8220;designed by committee.&#8221;</p>
<p>10% is not shit.</p>
<p>10% isn&#8217;t cool. You know what&#8217;s cool? A billion percent.</p>
<p>You can have a shrinking market share of a growing market and still make money. Didn&#8217;t they sell more BlackBerries this year than ever before or something?</p>
<p>Clearly RIM are in decline, but they don&#8217;t need to disappear or anything. There doesn&#8217;t just have to be two winners. BB10 will find something of an audience. This isn&#8217;t WebOS &#8211; level irrelevance.</p>
<p>Sounds like RIM is going for a long term plan, but unfortunately, it&#8217;s not going to be enough. Their failure to innovate early on is really going to hurt them now. At this point, they are in a lose/lose situation. Either throw something together quick and hope it sells just to keep the brand relevant until they come up with something worthy of being a competing smartphone, OR just give up on the fight for now and put some serious effort into R&amp;D and then come out with something great later on. The problem with the second option is that by the time they have some really amazing idea, it will be old and out-paced by Apple, Google, and Microsoft. There&#8217;s nothing they can do now. All they can do is sell the company, or give up,.</p>
<p>They actually move slower than the federal govt lmao.. They must have forgot that in the business world you can CUT the redtape if need be.. Fire half the damn company do something anything.. I swear they could make random blog commenters (I refuse to say commentators) Execs and do a better job..</p>
<p>If they managed to get something out earlier in the year, even if it is not fully baked but runs smooth like the original version of WP7 before mango. Then at least it shows everyone they have a solid new direction. As long has they have the core features working great (i.e, BBM, BB Enterprise stuff, Email!) then they will be fine.  If the titanic that is Microsoft, can change its direction, so can RIM.</p>
<p>Yeah, but MS has money to burn and they still haven&#8217;t gained any traction with Windows Phone.  They did release a half baked OS in the Playbook and look how that turned out.</p>
<p>whats  a playbook?</p>
<p>If they make it look like webOS I will jump on board.  I like a beating.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of news that goes well with their 70% in quarterly profits.  I wonder if there&#8217;s a way to check how much traffic to Monster.com has increased in Waterloo in the last week.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t their time to market, it is the fact that it is a completely different OS. If users (even business) have to switch to a new way of doing things, why not switch to one that has a huge following and been around for years? This is exactly why WP7 isn&#8217;t taking off (I&#8217;m a WP7 user).  If someone has to learn something new, they&#8217;re going to go for the most popular choice. Android and iOS have more capabilities than WP7, so not many are going to make that switch and BB10 will have the same problem.</p>
<p>nice knowing you, Blackberry&#8230;</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>Wow&#8230; that&#8217;s special. RIM officially has ZERO chance of rebounding&#8230;</p>
<p>Down goes Frazier!<br />
RIM is going to be owned by Facebook in 2013, saw the future</p>
<p>Man&#8230; I decided to take a peek at the stock price because I considered buying some a few years ago at around 60 a share&#8230; looking at it now&#8230; I&#8217;m just&#8230;. shocked that the people in charge of this publicly traded company aren&#8217;t gone yet.  It&#8217;s embarassing how much ground they&#8217;ve lost after jumping to such a huge lead in the consumer smartphone market.  What in the $@$# have they been doing?  At this point, I&#8217;m even starting to question the board.</p>
<p>I know right</p>
<p>Man RIM basically  just told their faithful fanbase &#8220;Hey we aint putting out anything good for a year, so feel free to find a new platform.&#8221; They don&#8217;t understand how fast their industry moves. Crazyness. Rest in peace Research in Motion</p>
<p>Absolutely.  Stick a fork in them.  We can all look to Palm and see the chain of events that led to their demise, and forecast RIM&#8217;s.</p>
<p>As Palm rested on its laurels(sp?) with PalmOS, they were surpassed by even Windows Mobile.  Finally, they had a last ditch effort with the Treo Pro.  That could be likened to the Bold Touch.   That all lines up perfectly&#8230; so it&#8217;s not going to be long now til RIM is done or absorbed into another company.</p>
<p>I totally agree. It&#8217;s like Lazaridis and Balsillie can&#8217;t see just how fast the industry is moving. By this time next year, dual-core phones will be a distant memory, yet RIM is betting on a dual-core LTE chipset. They need fresh vision over in Waterloo, and they&#8217;re not gonna get it as long as these two are still around.</p>
<p>You really don&#8217;t understand technology.  Just because it is not Quad doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not competitive &#8211; remember when iPhone 3GS was announced and everything was &#8216;Twice as Fast&#8217; as iPhone 3G?  Did they go to dual-core to get there?  No, they went from an ARMv6 core to an ARMv7 (Coretex-A8) core that is more efficient.  NVidia is bringing quad-A9&#8217;s out next year while Samsung, TI and others will bring dual-A15s, which are more efficient.  Qualcomm&#8217;s Krait core is also more efficient than the A9s and run faster to boot.  Lining up Qualcomm&#8217;s MSM8960 to NVidia&#8217;s Tegra3 you&#8217;ll find the 8960 is better on CPU (and not so great on GPU).<br />
If RIM launches a dual-A9 LTE chip in Q3&#8217;12 then I will agree they&#8217;re out of touch &#8211; but then again all of their BB7 phones are running the same HW as WP7 phones &#8211; it&#8217;s not the # of cores that&#8217;s going to sell the products, it will be if B10 is better than Android-&#8220;J&#8221; (K?) or IOS6 in that timeframe.  If they can deliver a compelling user experience then people will buy then regardless of what&#8217;s under the hood.</p>
<p>My favorite quote from his comments: <blockquote>We believe our strong BlackBerry 7 portfolio will continue to drive adoption of BlackBerry around the world. </blockquote></p>
<p>Drive adoption off a cliff sounds appropriate</p>
<p>sure, because nothing says adoption like small touch screens with plastic keys</p>
<p>Well&#8230;..good luck, RIM!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so glad I didn&#8217;t get RIMjob</p>
<p>BlackBerries have a surprising amount of RAM–Random Acts of Misery.</p>
<p>Bummer, Blackberry 10 looks way better than ICS.</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>I already know most around here will think I&#8217;m nuts, but here goes:</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s not good that they aren&#8217;t releasing BB10 phones until the second half of 2012, the reason they&#8217;re doing it at least makes me optimistic.  Everyone accuses them of not innovating but it looks like to me there&#8217;s an LTE chipset that will be low power (which is a big deal to RIM) which, on top of a new phone OS, looks quite good to me.  I can only hope that what Mike L. said about making sure they have a full ecosystem and such along with the release of BB10 phones is true.  I will still be waiting for a BB10 QWERTY keyboard.</p>
<p>As for the BB7 phones, as a current user of one, they aren&#8217;t the BBs of old.  I love my 9930 much more than I did my old Tour.  If current old BB users upgrade to BB7, they&#8217;ll be in for a surprise.</p>
<p>or they could move on to iOS or android and be in for a lot more of a suprirse.  &#8211; a new way of life.</p>
<p>Just &#8216;cause they say they plan to do all that doesn&#8217;t mean they will. RIM consistently falls short on their promises that I don&#8217;t even think they&#8217;ll have a phone ready for Q3. It&#8217;ll probably be Q4.</p>
<p>Just you watch.</p>
<p>Early 2012: &#8220;technical issues&#8221; either force RIM to use current gen LTE, or push BB10 to early 2013 to make changes. Calling it right now.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re either getting BB10 on time, or low power LTE. Not both.</p>
<p>Wow, really circling down the drain.  What possessed these guys to go Playbook first, we&#8217;ll never know.</p>
<p>and 7&quot; instead of 10</p>
<p>Because it was going to be an easy way to jump into a lucrative market. That&#8217;s what almost all of these post-iPad tablets have seemed like &#8212; people were buying these things and it was going to be easy to get some of that, especially if it had a big name like Blackberry attached to it.</p>
<p>As it&#8217;s turned out, of course, is that people aren&#8217;t just buying &#8220;tablets&#8221;&#8230;they&#8217;re buying iPads.</p>
<p>Dual core? Surely by late 2012 the competitors will be moving beyond dual core &#8211; there is already a quad core tablet on the market, and phones in the pipeline.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/07/rims-mike-lazaridis-qnx-coming-to-blackberry-phones-when-dual/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/07/rims-mike-lazaridis-qnx-coming-to-blackberry-phones-when-dual/</a> LOLOLOL</p>
<p>And likely next year we will hear the same thing again.</p>
<p>Why is there a need for Blackberry anymore? The big three mobile OSs have already captured the market and lets be honest there is really no room for a forth. RIM is dead in the consumer space and eventually as time moves, newer people who move into enterprise and will move away from RIM too.</p>
<p>many of todays consumer smartphones have enterprise support.</p>
<p>And what are &#8220;The Big Three&#8221; here?  Surely you must mean Symbian as #1 right, given it still has the largest distribution of the mobile market?<br />
Or even if you were looking at just US Smartphone demographic, you would realize that RIM&#8217;s OS is still in the top 3, both in install base and market share.  Both iOS and Andriod took off like a rocketship in the last five years &#8211; what&#8217;s to say that BB10 won&#8217;t come on strong to usurp the thrown once again (given they had at least 40% of US market before)?  You people are too short sighted.</p>
<p>Because enterprise is following consumer choices now, and Blackberry has always been enterprise first?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of reasons people might have to switch AWAY from Blackberry, and not many to switch to it. If you can argue otherwise, I&#8217;m actually interested, because with all of these other smartphones on the market no one has ever told me why I&#8217;d want a BB.</p>
<p>RIM may as well just close down now and give the money back to the shareholders. I mean, seriously, what kind of stuff are they smoking up in Waterloo to let things get this bad?! The iPhone was announced in January 2007, almost <em>five</em> years ago! The co-CEOs should have got fired a long time ago&#8230;</p>
<p>be careful when you say a company should fold, remember when Michael Dell said that about Apple?</p>
<p>Well Apple is different. RIM is just a ding brand. They may have been revelenet in 2003 but not now.,</p>
<p>And when it&#8217;s finally released quad core will be the norm&#8230;</p>
<p>or quin core or sex core</p>
<p>What does it take to fire a CEO?    CEOs are supposed to make shareholders happy, and keep them happy.</p>
<p>If their 2 CEOs haven&#8217;t been fired already, I need to ask why.</p>
<p>why do they even need two CEOS? that alone tells you something wrong is with the compney.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just put this in here&#8230; <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/07/rims-mike-lazaridis-qnx-coming-to-blackberry-phones-when-dual/" target="_blank">http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/07/rims-mike-lazaridis-qnx-coming-to-blackberry-phones-when-dual/</a></p>
<p>Yet again RIM is trying to pander to the US market only, the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t matter. The US is far from the be all and end all market for anyone.</p>
<p>Yeah, look how well that worked out for Nokia&#8230;</p>
<p>Well Nokia still thinks its the 90s.</p>
<p>most of todays tech companies started in the US.</p>
<p>But the US is the only place they&#8217;re actually in a bit of trouble.  Their BB7 products will sell OK for the next couple quarters in the rest-of-world (except maybe China).  Questions though is how long can emerging markets, Latin America, South-East Asia, etc keep them afloat, particularly when half those countries are threatening to ban data service to BB unless RIM lets them spy on their users?</p>
<p>RIM needs to fill the feature phone void that everyone is leaving.  Something like this in the fall of 2012 would turn them around and make them market leaders in the segment.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.finesttechnology.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/motorolastartac.jpg" /></p>
<p>Do they even want to stay in business?</p>
<p>They do, but they don&#8217;t know how to do so.</p>
<p>From the little I know about RIM it appears they were always a company for the enterprise market. Their success in the consumer market was a happy accident. They released a half backed product in the Playbook and got burned bad by it. They are wise to learn from the mistakes. Release a quality full featured product and retain your enterprise market and forget the consumer market. The consumer market just moves too fast and competition is too great for the likes of RIM.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs once said of the enterprise market is that the decision makers are idiots and completely out of touch. I think those guy are t</p>
<p>&#8230; I think those guys are their true customers.</p>
<p>Even todays consumer smartphones are starting to have enterprise support.</p>
<p>And that means enterprise customers are adopting bring-your-own-device policies and further digging RIM&#8217;s grave.</p>
<p>if Rim were the titanic, then the titanic is splitting in half</p>
<p>And Apple and Google are the high tech, extremely aggressive iceberg.</p>
<p>I think even Microsoft with Windows Phone would be a big enough iceberg</p>
<p>Lazardis what is wrong with you man? Why is the company falling apart.. It really kind of pisses me off. Does this mean the 2.0 for the playbook will get delayed as well? Let it go and pass down the torch there are many people in your own company that would take blackberry to new places.. Why so much disorganization? Jaguar is going to rip your ass into pieces if you dont snap out of it!</p>
<p>I take you are a Rim/.Blackberry fan?</p>
<p>Jaguar isn&#8217;t going to do shit &#8211; they don&#8217;t have enough shares themselves, and anyone else they may want to get on board (institutional investors) will first talk it through with Mike &amp; Jim.  However, I can&#8217;t wait for the next AGM to see if there is mass revolt to re-appoint either of them to their current roles, or to get current members of the board replaced for lack of corporate governance.  It really is like Mike just runs the show and this is a &#8216;public company&#8217; only in the minds of shareholders, otherwise it&#8217;s the company Mike built from scratch and he can drive it off a cliff if he damn well chooses.  Dude needs to pull a Gates and just step away from the day-to-day and focus on refining The Vision.  Or getting A Vision.  Or something.   Visioneering.</p>
<p>yes, is that ok?</p>
<p>Tip. If you are gonna replay to someone, hit the reply button under their name and of course its alright, but you do know Rim is slowly dieing right?</p>
<p>I still think they have a chance, but I think an oncoming hostile takeover will eventually happen with companies like Jaguar doing everything in their power to get RIM to respond.</p>
<p>Jaguar can do anything they want. its the consumer who will respond to the results.</p>
<p>huh okay buddy lol</p>
<p>Its true. Consumers win as they choose what they want and if RIM cant product a product they do not like then no one will buy it.</p>
<p>At this point, RIM should be considering pulling a Sega and move from hardware sales to software. Sticking with a dual-core mobile cpu is not a bad thing if the hardware &amp; software combination offered a competitive, polished alternative to Android, iOS and Windows Mobile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, RIM&#8217;s fate may have already been sealed. If this new phone and software combination are not truly world-class, they&#8217;re done!</p>
<p>so pretty much open source their OS?  I think they should just go out. We dont really need a fourth or 5th OS. Android and iOS are the top dogs. WP7 is catching up. Web OS is still deciding if they want to hang out with the &#8220;cool kids&#8221;  RIM is the typical douchebag prep that no one likes.</p>
<p>oops not you that comment was for someone else</p>
<p>No, their back-end software is too valuable to be open sourced. Because of the security and overall dependability of the software, it would be acquired by one of the &#8220;big 3&#8221; mobile os vendors to strengthen their enterprise software and business. It would be more valuable to Microsoft to acquire RIM if only to erase a main competitor.</p>
<p>Google would also be interested in acquiring RIM to strengthen their enterprise business and would give another possible revenue stream for Motorola.</p>
<p>I think they may have a problem see someone rooted qnx already so the question of its security is at hand. They know their current OS is enterprise safe, but they are not sure if the new one is.. So it is no way for them to release these awesome phones until security is assured. Because that is their knack</p>

<p>Have you looked at a balance sheet before?  I keep seeing this comment about how RIM should ditch their HW and have to think &#8211; can these people read or what?  RIM gets consistently 70% or more of their revenue from HW sales &#8211; they are a HW company.  They brought in 1B in revenue from &#8216;software and services&#8217; for the first time last quarter, and that was 25% of their revenue.  They have an ecosystem that works &#8211; their infrastructure supports their OS, which runs on their HW, together it is an enticing product and drives sales.  Replace one of these (eg: Android for OS) and you now have looser integration and a less compelling story.  They sink or swim together, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>I think their balance sheet reflects the fact that some Blackberry devices are sold at $230 on contract. I&#8217;ll be the first to tell you that Blackberry&#8217;s always felt great in the hand and are built very sturdy, but they are not running the hardware to command those prices, especially considering the volume of corporate sales and the overall state of the hardware inside the phones.</p>
<p>My point: RIM does not run the best of the current generation of hardware. Their balance sheet reflects huge profit margins in hardware sales because their contract prices are highly inflated. RIM will not be able to sustain these high hardware prices for long. Once sales start to trend downward significantly and more drastically &amp; consistently, the benefit of the hardware revenue numbers will cease and RIM will be dead.</p>
<p>If I were a RIM employee, I would be updating my resume and seriously considering relocating to Northern California or Washington because RIM is either going to fail or be acquired for their patents and software.</p>
<p>if I were a RIM employee I would walk out now. (or three years ago)</p>
<p>If I were a RIM employee I&#8217;d be happy I had a job in the current economic climate.</p>
<p>of course therte are jobs out there. You can&#8217;t be picky my friend. Plus if you were smart you would have a nothe rjob lined uop.</p>
<p>besides rim is in cananda, not the US, so nice try ;)</p>
<p>I agree, but if they wait to long to jump ship, their co-workers will take the few jobs that will become available when, if, RIM goes under.</p>
<p>If I were a skilled employee at RIM &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t need to be happy about having a job in the current economic state because dev jobs are still booming like a mother if you know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>If I were a RIM employee I would be striving to change things from the inside!!!</p>
<p>Okay, maybe not&#8230;  I&#8217;d be chillin, messaging around on my BBM, knowing that no one could possibly sink us because we are just that awesome.  I would ignore those middle of the night sweats and keep taking my prozac&#8230;  Everything is fine&#8230; Everything is fine&#8230;</p>
<p>With this news, RIM should make a deal with the major carriers so that their phones are either free on contract or cost no more than $99 on new contracts. RIM has to move their business to the low-end of the market, for both enterprise and consumer, to maintain sales against Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Most of yinz are stating the obvious and ignoring the fundamentals.  We all know RIM will never again make a competitive smartphone.</p>
<p>They do have an incredibly large patent moat.  If MOT is worth 13 billion-ish, and was it Nortel&#8217;s patents worth a few billion, RIM is actually poised to sell them selves for a shit ton of cash.</p>
<p>If Apple were to buy RIM, good luck to any competitor wishing to do push email/notifications, or who wishes to attach a decent physical keyboard to a smartphone, or who wants to do secure email.</p>
<p>RIM has one big moment left, and that&#8217;s when it will go supernova.  Wait for it.</p>
<p>there are plenty of keyboard phones out there. most e-mail clients do push now and e-mail use is less and less</p>
<p>Typing this message from my blackber&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>Yeah, they&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>RIM, please, <em>please</em> survive till then, as Blackberry OS 10 looks <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>I am glad, though, that they&#8217;re spending so much time perfecting it. They didn&#8217;t try with the Playbook, but maybe they&#8217;ll do better here.</p>
<p>someone needs a burning platform memo &#8230;</p>
<p>Releasing that late, BB10 will need to be ridiculously innovative if RIM wants any chance at success.</p>
<p>Yo, BB, open-source that shit already!</p>
<p>I bet it&#8217;s full of holes big enough to drive a semi through.</p>
<p>Good thing nobody writes 3P software for it&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;This chipset will not be available until mid-2012&#8221;</p>
<p>What? They can&#8217;t find a highly integrated LTE, dual core chipset on the market at the moment? Is it the integrated LTE radio that is slowing things down? While that seems like BS anyhow, even if it were true it&#8217;s not a good reason to hold off on using some other dual core chip in the meantime. Only a few (admittedly important) markets have LTE, meaning that RIM is holding off putting out a device until it supports a technology that is not even supported in more than half the smartphone-buying world anyhow. Why not put out a solid 3g (or HSPA+) dual-core handset with BB10, let it sell reasonably well in Europe and on the non-LTE US carriers until late 2012? Is RIM saying they can&#8217;t find any dual-core chipset to put in their devices right now? That&#8217;s ludicrous, and RIM&#8217;s management should be replaced for even suggesting such a lame excuse.</p>
<p>I have a Blackberry phone(which I will be getting rid of sometime next week). When I first bought my first BBerry 2 years ago I loved it, now it sucks. I will be so happy to switch to Android. Sorry Blackberry but you going down fast and I don&#8217;t think you can be saved.</p>
<p>I have some respect for the way RIM is approaching this.  When they released the Playbook, they released a half-assed product that was rushed to market.  They got burned by it.  So if they think that they need to be patient in order to release the right product, then that&#8217;s fine by me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still skeptical that there will be a compelling product at the end of this, mind you.</p>
<p>They said something like this last time. They always seem to be waiting for chips to be released and that delays their products. I think they still think its 2005 where you can release a product whenever you like. Nowadays, when you fail to release something your allowing your competitor to lock in your customer even deeper in to their eco-system.</p>
<p>Every month you delay your losing millions of future customers who will be even harder to turn around to buying your product because they will have 100 apps that they like on their phones. Microsoft are dealing with exactly the same issues. The modern market is all about lock in, its not fluid where there wasnt much difference between Nokia, Sony Ericcson and Motorla&#8230; Now the difference is the same as Mac vs PC.</p>
<p>My mantra, is release first, ask questions later! You need something in the market now that makes the customer ask the question, should I get yours or should I get theirs? If you dont have product out of some sort how can the customer ask that question? Bill Gates is the master of that cock-block manoeuvre!</p>
<p>I think RIM like to buy chips in such large quantities and reuse the same processor in every device for like 5yrs! They are being penny pinching, looking for the best deal whilst the market disappears in front of them.. <br />
Sad..</p>
<p>BB, I never had the pleasure, but it was nice knowing you #theend</p>
<p>I never owned a RIM product nor will I.  If RIM was to license WebOS they might have one last chance but it looks like it&#8217;s over. In my mind it&#8217;s been over for 2 years now</p>
<p>Rim has enough of a core user base that they aren&#8217;t going anywhere&#8230;&#8230;that isn&#8217;t to say that they might have to cut half their work force to stay afloat or possible be taken over hostilely.  It&#8217;s funny because just in the last election cycle they had such momentum going that even the would be president relied heavily on their services.  It is amazing how quickly things move.</p>
<p>I agree with those who are saying that RIM is losing customers every time have an a delay,  however I do think it is time that the y take the extra time to work out all the bugs before they throw another product into the wild ie&#8230;.playbook.  While I totally agree that folks are becoming more entrenched in their respective eco system,  I don&#8217;t think it is impossible for another non-android/iphone company to come out and hit a home run.  I mean look at the Kindle Fire,  Amazon did not have it&#8217;s own branded Android tablet until what 4-5 weeks ago.  Sure they pushed out with their own app-store 3-4 monthes ago but nevertheless they were a non-player in the android tablet field but now they own it.</p>
<p>So my two points are this&#8230;.</p>
<p>1.  RIM worst case scenario has a secure future selling to a small number of companies that want their end to end security.  (I know alot of companies are adopting a bring your own devices but there will always be(next 10-15 years) companies that are slow to switch,  Not to mention RIM is still grown in certain markets.</p>
<p>2.  It is possible and very likely that in the next 5 years that someone besides Apple or Google or Windows will do something great in the mobile space.  Now don&#8217;t get me wrong I would be surprised if it was RIM but I do think someone will and it could be RIM.</p>
<p>Someone in the comments above mentioned how Michael Dell declared Apple dead in the late 90&#8217;s.  Then someone said well that was Apple&#8230;..you need to keep in mind that leaving in 2011 and thinking about apple is totally different then living in 1998 and thinking about Apple.  I realize RIM doesn&#8217;t have someone very creative from it&#8217;s past coming back to the helm&#8230;bringing someone from the outside always has advantages to thinking outside of the box.  I would say that in order for RIM to have a snowball&#8217;s chance in hell it needs to have something change at the top but again that is possible.</p>
<p>Let the hater&#8217;s hate and let the fan boy&#8217;s fan.</p>
<p>And they will sink further and further down behind their competition.  I use to love BB, but they just can&#8217;t keep up with the times.</p>
<p>   The real problem here is leadership.  there has not been any for at least 8 years. The board has to replace     Laurel and Hardy (and all their yes men). There is no other way for RIM to survive.  It wont be the first time the fouinders of a compnay have had ot leave. In fact it is a natural progression for a lot of large companies. <br />
RIM has delayed it far far too long.</p>
<p>So how long until Lazaridis makes his version of the &#8216;burning platform&#8217; speech?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like RIM is trying to win the Stupidest Company of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Android killer</p>
<p>Impossible to know. The device looks nice, but saying an OS will be a killer based off a single image? Jumping to conclusions just a<em> little</em> too quickly on that one.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true but there are some high expectations for BB10.</p>
<p>If it can do what android do, plus the stability (on QNX) and features BB is known for then it could continue on for quite a while</p>
<p>May you introduce me to the people whom have high expectations regarding BB 10?</p>
<p>Anyone that has a blackberry.</p>
<p>Fewer people by the second then? ;-)</p>
<p>Very true, the HTC HD2 probably mastered this effect with it&#8217;s awesomely photographed Sense skin running on top of the horrid WinMo OS.</p>
<p>Also, the bezel has a bezel.  Fugly.</p>
<p>LOL&#8230; RRRRRRRRRRIGHT.</p>
<p>RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIGHT.  Too little too late.</p>
<p><img src="http://imgboot.com/images/wayiare/haha.gif" /></p>
<p>lol at the real housewives of atl gif&#8230;..love it</p>
<p>Random Phaedra .gifs are never not funny&#8230; And this BB London pic, if real { and I don’t think it is for a sec}, is very disappointing. <br />
I&#8217;ve been hoping that the aesthetic of the new devices would follow the Porsche design. This looks like a knock-off iPhone 4s.  :(</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BUicA.gif" /></p>
<p>Me going to my company&#8217;s BB manager on the day this thing launches!</p>
<p>Hahahahahahahahahahaha</p>
<p>dude, how many times are you going to post this gif?</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lno8yh2ydX1qb0524.gif" /></p>
<p>I thought the sarcasm was implied personally.</p>
<p>this is sarcasm right?</p>
<p>Wake up brother its.. morning!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s BlackBerry Jim, but not as we know it (hopefully).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worse that that, he&#8217;s dead, Jim.</p>
<p>You have to give the users a killer feature if you want to get any traction</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kinda disappointed. I liked the old design, it was different.</p>
<p>So they update their designs, people shout &#8220;GIVE US THE OLD DESIGN&#8221;, stay on the same designs people go like : &#8220;Typical old blackberry design, boring stuff&#8221;.</p>
<p>He meant the design The Verge leaked in November 2011. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/14/2561438/blackberry-london-qnx-picture-leak-exclusive">Here it is.</a></p>
<p>I liked that one better.</p>
<p>Same. It was unique.</p>
<p>Apps and content story?</p>
<p>Still not a fan of the UI so far, we&#8217;ll see. I&#8217;d like to see some developers on board though instead of running Android apps.</p>
<p>Am I the only one who thinks that UI looks way too Androidy? Design has never been a particular strong suit for RIM, but BB7 was a tep in the right direction. If they make it more like Android, it&#8217;s a step backwards.</p>
<p>Designing it like Android would be a huge step forward for the platform.</p>
<p>remember that they bought TAT? We have not seen much of what they have been working on since they got bought, I am really looking forward to seeing what they have come up with.</p>
<p>Android is even more a copy of iOs than windows was of Mac Os. I just can&#8217;t find the door&#8230;.</p>
<p>kind of looks like a droid x.</p>
<p>looks almost exactly like a Droid X.</p>
<p>Looks like the frame is the same size as the Droix X with a 3.5 inch screen.</p>
<p>Getting better RIM.</p>
<p>looks good.</p>
<p>Hardware looks alarmingly like a chinese rip-off of the Zune HD.</p>
<p>Atleast they chose a great looking device to rip off, they could have done much much worse!</p>
<p>looks&#8230;boring. at least the old prototype was unique</p>
<p>The old prototype looked like all those cheap Nokia smartphones.</p>
<p>Not sure about the UI, also, I miss the hardware QWERTY.</p>
<p>Me too. There aren&#8217;t enough hardware keyboards as it is, and even fewer in portrait. Not everyone wants a touchscreen slab&#8230;</p>
<p>I think it looks nice. But when you stare at it for longer than a few seconds, it looks abnormally long (yeah, yeah &#8212; &#8220;that&#8217;s what she said!&#8221;).</p>
<p>yeah, it&#8217;s got a bit of space above and below the display. It&#8217;s likely a 1024 &#215; 600 set up, like the playbook. From what we&#8217;ve heard so far the first BB10 phones will have that resolution.</p>
<p>I hope they move that &#8220;BlackBerry&#8221; label somewhere else on the phone (if it even warrants one)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;lending credence to our believe at the time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Small typo. Just trying to help.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Pretty excited about this. Not because I&#8217;m a Blackberry user, but because more competition is always better for the consumer. Frankly, I&#8217;m bored/ sick of the Apple vs Android stalemate. We need someone to shake things up a bit. Could it be Blackberry? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe not. But I surely hope so.</p>
<p>Looks nice! I did prefer the silver design a bit more. Makes it stick out, and be more individual.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same design. Enlarge the image.</p>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t.  The first image showed the London with a silver chin where it says Blackberry, and that was the end of the bezel. This image shows the Blackberry in black and then there&#8217;s a black chin under that, making it longer and weirder. <br />
I prefer the silver one too. It kind of reminds me of why I find iMacs so beautiful (the silver-black duo).</p>
<p>Nevermind, I just noticed how it is basically the same thing, only the Blackberry logo has moved. <br />
Still, I don&#8217;t like that they made the bezel more round and for me less slick and the black-on-black made it too discrete.</p>
<p>Hopefully this won&#8217;t fail like the Storm.</p>
<p>Its hard to fail that hard without trying to fail.</p>
<p>If this is indeed a legit photo of the upcoming flagship BB10, then devs should pay close attention to the buttons/UI on display. It may be the first signs of a unified design for native apps built on the yet-to-be-released Cascades framework.</p>
<p>I hope they bring out a variant with the silver accents on the earlier prototype.</p>
<p>This will be tough for them I think.<br />
Just from that image &#8211; why would I buy it over an Android phone? The App ecosystem is obviously going to be much worse, the hardware doesn&#8217;t seem considerably more amazing, the UI seems average (so far).</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going to have to pull something crazy out of their sleeves. I hope they do.</p>
<blockquote>They’re going to have to pull something crazy out of their sleeves. I hope they do.</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t get your hopes up.</p>
<p>Why does it look like a droid X?</p>
<p>A Droid X that fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down..</p>
<p>that phone is ugly, sorry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks kind of like a Droid X running Kindle Fire OS.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t give me any reason to buy this.</p>
<p>So am i the only one seeing this ? <br />
By going along with the Promo Shot .. its looks like RIM is again going the Consumer route .. <br />
The tone of the marketing blurb and the image showing a music player app ..</p>
<p>So it will be again a shift away from the core RIM customers .. The Business users!</p>
<p>And what does &#8220;Quality App and Content Story&#8221; mean ? <br />
About Quality Apps .. how many Big Name Developers have signed up BlackBerry 10 so far ?</p>
<p>And a leak of this seems pretty convenient if you ask me .. (let them see what we have in store and maybe a lot of customers will stick with us till the LONDON comes out ..)</p>
<p>RIM have been going for the consumer for a long time now.</p>
<p>Almost every &#8216;cool&#8217; teenager at the college I go to (in the UK) has a BlackBerry. They&#8217;re definitely not business users. What does that tell you?</p>
<p>Controlled Leak. <br />
The new CEO just gave Crackberry an interview. They&#8217;re aware that&#8217;s the mainline to the hardcore BB fans.</p>
<p>Looks terrible..</p>
<p>The source website says the opposite</p>
<p>What do you expect from a PRO-Blackberry website?</p>
<p>That looks extremely fake&#8230;</p>
<p>Very tiny camera&#8230; Extremely, impossibly thin&#8230; If it&#8217;s their &#8220;new design direction,&#8221; then they are clearly going to fail, anybody with eyes would notice, hence: I still call fakesies.</p>
<p>Impossibly thin or unknowingly large?</p>
<p>It looks like what the Playbook was to tablet design, for phones.</p>
<p>Even if it comes out really great, I don&#8217;t really think it can handle the pressure exerted by SGS3 and iPhone5.</p>
<p>#BeBold indeed.</p>
<p>Hopefully this time around, it will come with all of the native apps</p>
<p>Too little too late. It looks like a major step in the right direction, but the time to do this was 2 years ago. Even Windows Phone 7 is suffering from just being too damned late to get any traction, with a 1.5% market share and falling. The war is over, RIM.</p>
<p>Plus, that spec, while competitive now, is similar to mid-2011 devices, and it&#8217;ll be their flagship late 2012?</p>
<p>I use Android.<br />
But egged on by Canadian pride,  pray that this makes it big and WP8 dies and shrivels away like WP7.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind if wp died and bb10 took over their piece of the market.  I really dislike wp7. At least blackberry has something unique besides another user interface. Security.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quality Apps and Content Story&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a fake photo.</p>
<p>A city themed branding for BBX devices would be really cool in my opinion.</p>
<p>Cooler than the Galaxy Thunderbolt S II Touch Pro Epic 4G anyways.</p>
<p>Then they should have named this one Fallujah.</p>
<p>They better rework this to waste less space around the display&#8230; this has a comically large top/bottom bezel.</p>
<p>Considering that there will be an iPhone 5, GSIII, and HTC Edge launching before this. I think this will be a Pre 3, a product announced but never released. Or a touchpad. Came out, a month later, Fire sale, or die.</p>
<p>I absolutely love Android right now as I have done over the last couple of years after moving from Blackberry, mainly because of the whole interface and general user experience was something I didn&#8217;t like too much.</p>
<p>I would really love to see, and am very anxious to see what RIM do with the evolution of their OS to BB 10, it would definitely interest me as an alternative to Android over iOS, which doesn&#8217;t interest me much at all.</p>
<p>Yeah, a &#8220;leak&#8221;. Riiiight. I&#8217;m sure all the bad press lately at RIM had nothing to do with this &#8220;leak&#8221; getting out. Anyways, this is obviously a render. A crappy looking one at that.</p>
<p>Try not to look so desperate there, guys.</p>
<p>I really hope their new hardware aesthetic isn&#8217;t &#8220;be generic&#8221;. There was a brief few hours prior to release that I really wanted a Torch, if they had released that even today and gotten it right&#8230;well&#8230;I don&#8217;t know how I want to end this sentence. The point is: Blackberry has a nice design theory now and I would hate to see them throw it all away during the inevitable all touch transition.</p>
<p>The design is copy of the Zune HD.</p>
<p>Wow welcome to 2007 rim.</p>
<p>No, this is definitely the same one we saw earlier. Just look closer. There&#8217;s the exact same creases along the screen except it&#8217;s in Black and the design is slightly refined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little too late to do the right thing now.</p>
<p>Blackberry software keyboards are really really awful, are they really giving up on the best hardware keyboards in the industry? One of their remaining core competencies?</p>
<p>Hardware looking good i must say</p>
<p>I have to agree with a lot of the comments, the Porsche influenced design was <em>much</em> better.</p>
<p>If this is in fact the design that will be pushed out, I would be disappointed. This is RIM&#8217;s big chance to not only overhaul their hardware and software, but to show people that they can also lead in those areas as well. It is not everyday that a brand gets the chance to rethink everything—there needs to be some semblance of continuity over long periods of time. This design relies too heavily on old concepts: the original iPod Touch formfactor, the iOS like black/blue bottom navigation, the iPad-like album layout.</p>
<p>Huge improvement, but still huge disappointment.</p>
<p>The only question is will it have the same user experience as an iPhone. Meaning everything works. If so they rim could still be in the game. Android has to step up there game big time. But these are just rumours. But knowing rim well they will mess it up.</p>
<p>Never been a Blackberry guy; but being a Canadian and a University of Waterloo alum (city where RIM is located) I want them to succeed. I don&#8217;t like seeing the company in this free fall. They need to stop talking so much and just start cranking out good products. I hope they find a way to do that.</p>
<p><em>if </em> this is accurate, it&#8217;s the most underwhelming thing I&#8217;ve seen yet from RIM.</p>
<p>Literally every single one of those bullets &#8211; with the exception of the &#8220;Blackberry 10&#8221;  bullet- describe what&#8217;s already available, and what&#8217;s going to arrive from the other major players in the market before the end of the year.</p>
<p>It also looks exactly like everything else that&#8217;s already available, save the logo on the back.</p>
<p>RIM is past the point of being able to just toss out another indistinguishable thin slate device with two cameras, rounded corners and a dual core processor.</p>
<p>Those devices already exist and are built on ecosystems which are far better.</p>
<p>RIM needs to create a product which is both solid and distinct as well as better at email and text communication than everything else out there &#8211; by a large margin.</p>
<p>Another iPhone/Android clone is not going to do it &#8211; that ship has sailed.</p>
<p>Most of the above posts don&#8217;t get it.  RIM doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;hardware&#8221; problem today, their hardware designs are just fine, and from the looks of this render, this one will be fine too.  What they have, is a SOFTWARE problem.  Specifically an operating system, application, and ecosystem problem.</p>
<p>BlackBerry Tablet OS 2 will give us the first hint of whether they have a chance at solving the OS problem in a smartphone.  The next several months, with the BlackBerry tablet&#8217;s relaunch, and when they (finally!) release their new application development framework, will start to tell us whether RIM can start to bridge the quality apps divide that separates BlackBerry from iPhone, Android, and yes I&#8217;ll say it, WP7.</p>
<p>Looks very boring. I liked the original prototype pic better with the metallic top and bottom ends.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/gallery/no/face.gif" /></p>
<p>Looks like a Zune HD.</p>
<p>5 years late</p>
<p>Looks like a big iPhone with the rounded corners and horizontal top speaker. Duh. They should have stuck with the original London&#8217;s angular/zunehd look, which could actually be distinguished from other phones.  Dumb move RIM. Now it looks like any Samsung on the market which of course rips off iPhone.</p>
<p>Looks fantastic, needs Windows Phone</p>
<p>Def better than that silver one.</p>
<p>Looks like a Droid X</p>
<p>Looks good, but they can do better. The resemblance with other Android devices is apparent.</p>
<p>So how seamless will its android app experience be?  It better be friggin perfect.</p>
<p>That said, if they are able to put out a phone like that, which keys into android apps, but retains all the good qualities of RIM products&#8230; then that is a pretty killer device.</p>
<p>Personally I like the design of the previous spy imaged London better.</p>
<p>I agree. At least it was unique. I hope they are releasing both of these designs.</p>
<p>My first thought was I liked the Porsche design better (this one is similar, but not quite the same. The small differences matter) and the OS looks like a mashup between the Kindle Fire UI and Android.</p>
<p>Needs more cowbell</p>
<p>Unless they did something amazing with the soft keyboard the lack a physical keyboard is bad bad bad. I know touch screen is all the rage, but they just shafted their loyal users who only got their phone for the best KB in the industry. In which case they are making yet another touch screen phone for an already crowded market that may have BBM and a potentially good OS, but lacks the ecosystem of the competing platforms?</p>
<p>The screen could still be so much taller. theres so much unused space at the top!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny how all the BlackBerry fanboys talk bad about the iPhone and Android devices, but now their next &#8220;superphone&#8221; looks just like a Droid X and they love it with all their heart.</p>
<p>Just found on <a href="http://gadgetstip.com" target="_blank">http://gadgetstip.com</a> , Not a big site but this will be amazing !!    <img src="http://gadgetstip.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/blackberry_concept.jpg" /> I would love to get one if RIM launch it :)</p>
<p>Call me crazy but I like the look of the london. But I secretly know that the suits at RIM will somehow fuck that up.<br />
I&#8217;m also not too keen on the strange Meego/android/touchwiz look and feel that BB10 has going on, but I guess you can&#8217;t really know until you hold one in your hands.</p>
<p>The BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha holds entirely more secrets than this.</p>
<p>do tell</p>
<p>I just hope that when they release BB10, it will be a fully baked OS. Imagine if they left out a native email client for the first few months of its release&#8230;</p>
<p>it has an email client.  they fixed the problem.  drop the hate.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The London is fresh ta def! Looks just like the playbook&#8230;.I WANT!!!!!!</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;.that isn&#8217;t the London&#8230;..well I WANT THAT PROTOTYPE!!!!</p>
<p>Let the riots [re]commence!</p>
<p>Peckham has a new icon</p>
<p>How much does it go for?</p>
<p>Depends on which contract you go for; it isn&#8217;t being sold unlocked just yet.</p>
<p>Unlocked always&hellip;my country has no contracts.</p>
<p>470GPB if that carphone warehouse leak is anything to go by. Might have to go to a Phones 4u shop to check it out&hellip;</p>
<p>Just checked Carphone Warehouse. It&rsquo;s actually listed at &pound;479.95 under their SIM-free section.</p>
<p>Damn that&rsquo;s expensive!! Even the 920 is cheaper here in India. Only the iPhone is more expensive.</p>
<p>CPW selling it SIM free for &pound;479.95. O2 are selling it PAYG for &pound;479.99. The mind boggles.</p>
<p>$599 US unlocked. Don&rsquo;t know about Europe.</p>
<p>&pound;1 = $1.58<br />
$599 / 1.58 = &pound;379.11<br />
+ 20% VAT = &pound;454.93</p>
<p>Adding all the other taxes, you pretty much get that &pound;470 Carphone warehouse leak.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s around &euro;540, but it will change per country depending on the VAT, although they usually around 20%.</p>
<p>where it&rsquo;s $599 US Unlocked?</p>
<p>I saw that too, in a headline some where. Probably will be $599 off contract, not unlocked. One does not simply buy an unlocked phone in the US.</p>
<p>March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to relaunch our brand and introduce completely new devices, so here&rsquo;s an old, failed tablet that symbolizes all our bad decisions and the lethargy we spent the last five years in. Don&rsquo;t worry, you can play Android apps on it. You know, the OS we&rsquo;re trying to compete against. Hey, do you like Alicia Keys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Playbook is running on QNX same as the Z10 and it will be updated to BB10.  You haven&rsquo;t used one have you?  It&rsquo;s actually quite a good tablet right now and will only get better with the upcoming BB10 upgrade.</p>
<p>Incidentally do you know what the best selling tablet in the UK was last quarter?  Nope, not the iPad 4. It was the Blackberry Playbook.</p>
<p>Eh? IDC: iPad competitors see strong growth, but Apple leads the way<br />

<p>Like I said: in the UK.</p>
<p><a href="http://crackberry.com/blackberry-playbook-outselling-new-ipad-uk" target="_blank">http://crackberry.com/blackberry-playbook-outselling-new-ipad-uk</a></p>
<p>Without counting the apple stores&hellip;</p>
<p>Or the iPad Mini&hellip;</p>
<p>These numbers include the Mini.</p>
<p>Did it outsell the iPad mini?</p>
<p>Yes. By a lot.</p>
<p>Playbook: 160,000<br />
iPad 4: 113,000<br />
iPad mini &amp; iPad 2 combined: 90,000</p>
<p>The PlayBook is dreadful. It can&rsquo;t compete with the Google Nexus 7 or the Kindle Fire HD. It feels extremely sluggish in comparison to either. It &ldquo;may&rdquo; have outsold the iPad 4 (in Nov/Dec not the quarter) but that&rsquo;s simply because it&rsquo;s sitting in clearance bins in retail stores such as Currys / PC World for a fraction of it&rsquo;s original market price and lots of unsuspecting parents picked them up for kids for Christmas.</p>
<p>Nail<br />
Head</p>
<p>Actually, it&#8217;s awesome. Its biggest flaw is the app selection, but I only bought it to browse the web, read The Verge, some Facebook, some light porn, etc.</p>
<p>I have a Playbook and a Google Nexus 7. I like the playbook better.</p>
<p>I also have both and have no idea what you are talking about.  In many ways it is a better tablet than the Nexus 7.</p>
<p>The only way the Nexus is clearly better is app selection and that is getting better very quickly.</p>
<p>And once the Playbook gets upgraded to BB10 it will be even better.</p>
<p>Hey, tried to stream via <span class="caps">DLNA</span> via the browser out of the box on the iPad?  Big red X is what you get.  Hey, do you think you&rsquo;ll get all the bells and whistles of a completely revamped OS on your Nexus 7?  Yeah right.  The hardware in the PlayBook is enough to simultaniously control 10,000 mini robots to hammer the hell out of your Nexus and your Kindle and your shitty iPad too.  Next guy.</p>
<p><strong>They already stated that the playbooks will be upgraded to the new BB10.</strong></p>
<p>Hey Prediction, go f yourself, because that&rsquo;s all you can predict.  Have you even touched one?  Didn&rsquo;t think so.  So before you start talking about how sour other fruit are, look at your rotten apple.</p>
<p>Too high price. They need to be hitting the &pound;200-40 unsubsidised mid-market sweet spot. &pound;400+ puts them in with the big boys where they barely hold parity and will slip further once the 2013 models hit after MWC.</p>
<p>At that price its too expensive for the existing user base and not good enough for the premium user base. Rock. Hard place.</p>
<p>If by unsubsidised you mean SIM free/without a contract, you&rsquo;ll never find a brand new smartphone for around &pound;200-&pound;240 in the UK.  A smartphone with the specs of the Blackeberry Z10 would never be priced so lowly unless the sales were so slow, they were discounting heavily to shift stock as was done with the Lumia 800 recently.</p>
<p>A &pound;36 p/m contract is fairly reasonable for a new mid to high end smartphone where the handset is either free, or going for a small up front cost.</p>
<p>Not entirely true:</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_8gb" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_8gb</a></p>
<p>(&pound;239, if you can actually buy one&hellip;)</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>I guess the old saying about &lsquo;never say never&rsquo; is true.  &pound;239, although a fantastic price for the consumer, is still a pretty difficult figure for another manufacturer to match though.  Although rumoured to be sold at near cost prices via the Play store, without Google giving any insight into this it&rsquo;s hard to say whether that kind of price is even remotely sustainable for others outside the Nexus program who don&rsquo;t have that kind of backing.  Given that everywhere else it&rsquo;s priced much higher, I suspect that it&rsquo;s not exactly beneficial to even attempt to match Google&rsquo;s pricing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s so easy to buy a Nexus 4 isn&rsquo;t it? Tell me how that works for you.</p>
<p>I might well do &ndash; this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen it show anything other than &ldquo;Out of stock&rdquo; on the UK store, so it&rsquo;s pretty tempting to order one.</p>

<p>What are you on about?</p>
<p>I already replied above regarding the Nexus, but the HTC 8S is not on the same level as the Blackberry Z10.  I did mention that in terms of the specs, you&rsquo;re not going to find something brand new that&rsquo;s in that price range in the UK.  I missed the Google Play store price of the Nexus 4 originally, but it&rsquo;s still around &pound;300+ through many other major retailers.  In contrast, the HTC 8S is a budget smartphone with a spec sheet and price that match accordingly.</p>
<p>Sim free 
<p>I like how they report on UK aswell.</p>
<p>This is a bit expensive</p>
<p>You can polish a turd all you want its still a oiece of shit!</p>
<p>RIM oops I mean Blackberry is done.</p>
<p>Poor software old 1 year Hardware..iPhone 5 design rip off..Lame learning curve for gestures..PASS!</p>
<p>It looks nothing like an iPhone 5.</p>
<p>Should visit an optician pronto!</p>
<p>After all, it has rounded corners.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>And is a flat rectangular slate in either black or white!</p>
<p>SUE!!!!</p>
<p>Several people mistook my dev alpha for an iphone 5, something I got months and months before the iPhone 5 release. But of course apple invented the design first.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s evidented that the Z10 design was completed in late 2011. The first leaks of iPhone 5 came over half a year later. So piss off, prejudice and bias all over.</p>
<p>Did anyone get it yet?</p>
<p>I can choose among 4 different iPhones, a few WP8 phones and about a quadrillion Android based phones and now there comes one (!) new BB phone.<br />
Guess what the inclined customer will choose &hellip;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Guess it depends which way they&rsquo;re inclined.</p>
<p>ironically, the type of person who will be in the first 250, will already own a playbook.. still a sweet deal for BB fans</p>
<p>How about Q10? How much will it be sold without a contract?</p>
<p>Hard to feel sorry for them, this has been a long time coming.</p>
<p>It just goes to confirm (somewhat) that the investors don&#8217;t want RIM to innovate/compete in the industry anymore&#8230;.perhaps they want RIM to license their services to a company like Microsoft (BBM on Windows Phone/Windows8 anyone?).</p>
<p>Do people even care about BBM? I mean, like right now. in 2012.</p>
<p>Yeah, crazy as it seems there are still people who do.  I know lots of people who swear by BBM, people who&#8217;d love to be able to use it on Android or iOS.</p>
<p>Sadly people in India still prefer it and buy the BlackBerry brand.</p>
<p>I wish I had BBM on my Android phone.  A lot of my larger texts get messed up when sending them between different carriers in Canada.</p>
<p>Investors don&#8217;t judge the innovation by themselves – they are not experts at that. Instead, they try to capture the general sentiment they see being expressed. The general sentiment expressed was mixed, and it needed to be exuberant for investors to think RIM had a shot at recovery.</p>
<p>Feel sorry for me. I bought stock at $60. Fuck.</p>
<p>sorry!</p>
<p>When did you buy it at 60?  Was it sort of like horse racing. They were due for a win?</p>
<p>Buy more now! It&#8217;ll shoot up some when they finally get bought.</p>
<p>nail in the coffin?</p>
<p>Pretty much. As I&#8217;ve been writing for a while now, the value behind the BlackBerry phone system is BlackBerry Messenger. It, and the backend services, are what make the platform valuable. Without it, even a new BlackBerry 10 is just a so-so phone with a decent keyboard and a one-trick-pony camera app.</p>
<p>To survive, RIM needs  to hire a team of crack iOS, Android, and Windows developers and use them to create a set of RIM messaging apps based on their existing Enterprise platform. Then sell their customers on having a truly secure cross-platform system for their sensitive corporate communications.</p>
<p>They need to be on iOS. They need to be on Android. They need to be on Window&#8217;s Phone. And should have done it a year ago.</p>

<p>RIM cant even make a Mail app for their own PlayBook, do you really expect them to start writing apps for other OS&#8217;s?</p>
<p>BlackBerry PlayBook OS 2.0 has email.</p>
<p>Yea, it took until OS 2.0. And I&#8217;m a PlayBook OWNER. I&#8217;m not buying a BlackBerry phone just to have the bridge email like they wanted. I just want the table to be a tablet, and it mostly is with OS 2.0. Just took them a damn long time to realize that they can&#8217;t use the BB phone + PlayBook model&#8230; nobody wants the phone.</p>
<p><strong>tablet to be a tablet</strong></p>
<p>Fucking edit button, please!</p>
<p>Or&#8230; we could all slowly re-read our own comments before posting them.  There is a preview button.</p>
<p>Also, I apologize ahead of time for sounding snarky or smart-assy. I really don&#8217;t mean to come off this way.  I just wish people would take time to think about and coherently formulate their comments instead of instantaneously posting their immediate thoughts.</p>
<p>They are using Active Sync for email on the PlayBook which is licensed from MS. They don&#8217;t have BES/BIS email on the PlayBook or their upcoming Colt BB10 (QNX) devices.  If RIM cannot offer a connection to BES/BIS then their whole infrastructure and security model is mostly meaningless.  They pay a fortune to maintain and build out their back end servers but cannot use them with their new OS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but to say a &#8220;decent keyboard&#8221; or call the camera app a &#8220;one-trick-pony&#8221; makes it obvious that you are going to bash RIM no matter what they do.  Sure, you wanted to plug your article here, but making obserd comments before linking the article only makes me want to never read your website.  We get it that you run an Apple fan site and it is beneficial for RIM to fail, but making ridiculous posts like this isn&#8217;t going to make that happen.</p>
<p>LOL @ decent keyboard and &#8220;one-trick-pony&#8221; camera app&#8230;..  too funny!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with his comments? They showed a keyboard that looks decent and they showed a camera app with one novel feature.</p>
<p>I feel kind of bad for them. BB 10 looked like exactly the direction they needed to go in, I guess investors don&#8217;t feel the same way. I&#8217;m not sure what people could have asked for better.</p>
<p>I think stockholders are probably scared shitless that the company is making such a huge change.  Its either going to be a huge success story or a huge flop but right now stockholders dont want to throw all of their money on black and let the dice roll.  Its just too big of a risk that stockholders could possibly lose a lot of money on BB10 and who can blame them.</p>
<p>I see what you mean. This basically is the last ditch effort for RIM &#8211; if this fails (webOS for example), that will be the end for them.</p>
<p>webOS was the little train that could, but didn&#8217;t have the resources. RIM was the fledgling giant, with no foresight.</p>
<p>Ya im thinking this is it for RIM. Of they fail to make bank on BB10 they are in real danger of ceasing to exist. Personally I think they should stick to the infrastructure they already have, license out the tech to other companies and try to save themselves and just give up on hardware kind of like how sega stopped making game systems and concentrated on just making games and selling them to be used on other platforms. Bit we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>Yes the ends near for Rim</p>
<p>They needed to go in that direction back in 2008, I think their stubborn ways of email/keyboard are the only things that matter have proved that they&#8217;re important yes, but not the only important things in a phone.</p>
<p>This is the direction they need to go and what they need to do&#8230; but should have done at least 5 years ago.</p>
<p>working phone?</p>
<blockquote>BB 10 looked like exactly the direction they needed to go in&#8230;</blockquote>
<p>I agree&#8230; except for bad timing.  BB 10 should have come out a couple years ago.</p>
<p>WebOS was also pretty innovative and exciting&#8230; and that was 3 years ago.  But WebOS wasn&#8217;t able to gain traction against the formidable opponents Android and the iPhone&#8230; even back then.</p>
<p>I fear RIM will have an even <em>worse</em> time trying to compete today.</p>
<blockquote>But WebOS wasn’t able to gain traction against the formidable opponents Android and the iPhone… even back then.</blockquote>
<p>That was the LEAST of WebOS problem. First and foremost, WebOS had money, marketing and hardware issues from the start. That&#8217;s a three-pronged assault that would instantly destroy most companies. Thanks to their decently large IP and history, they survived just long enough to be taken over by a company that had money aplenty and the supposed clout to make some inroads in this tough industry.</p>
<p>However, as we have seen, HP FAILED fantastically. They poured in a considerable amount of money&#8230;but they lacked a clear vision, and then after taking so long to produce any product, they put out a product NOBODY really wanted (HP Veer), failed to give people what they actually wanted (the Pre3, but with better specs), and then rushed out a half-baked tablet. On top of all that, they failed to learn a DAMN thing from Palm&#8217;s past marketing blunders&#8230;and so they failed HARD.</p>
<p>Where RIM has gone wrong: Failing to acknowledge to themselves (let alone their investors and the rest of the world) that the market had changed dramatically, and that they needed to change in similar fashion in order to keep up. Then when they finally admit this to some extent, they&#8217;re failing to leverage strengths (BES/BIS) while giving people the other things they want in a timely fashion. BB10 does look like a step in the right direction&#8230;but it might just be a step too late.</p>
<p>No release date. That&#8217;s the big one that&#8217;s going to scare away investors. They didn&#8217;t make any promises about when this product will release, and honestly they didn&#8217;t show all that much detail about the product so nobody was given any reason to believe that it&#8217;s anywhere near close to being finished.</p>
<p>Also, as far as I could tell they didn&#8217;t talk much about enterprise features. It would be a very good idea for RIM to promise that 100% of their BES, BBM, and other secure enterprise features will be compatible on day one or else these BB10 phones will not be a viable upgrade for corporate users. Currently most of these features are not supported in Playbook 2.0, so there&#8217;s no guarantee that BB10 will either.</p>
<p>Or the perfect time to invest? Under new leadership, one dip in the markets had to have been seen coming by the company as well. If nothing else, they certainly have the resources to make a comeback––just a matter of how they&#8217;re planning to do it.</p>
<p>Wait for $7.39 to start buying.</p>
<p>If/when the stocks hit $7.39, I will buy in.<br />
Who&#8217;s with me?</p>
<p>*Jogging suits and Nike runners not included.</p>
<p>Not all stocks bounce when they go down.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not talking about all stocks. We&#8217;re talking about the company who pioneered mobile email. Then again, maybe they&#8217;ve played their part in the tech world.</p>
<p>Palm pioneered the PDA. Seen them around recently?</p>
<p>Apple Pioneered the PDA almost a decade before Palm had anything to do with it. Look at the OS images from the Newton and see how little Palm had to change.</p>
<p>The Palm team was the Newton Team that left Apple after Newton was killed IIRC. Palm&#8217;s edge was Grafitti -worked better than Apple&#8217;s attempt at natural handwriting recognition.</p>
<p>They may but they have a lot to do to make it with Apple, android oems and even nokia with windows phone taking the lead</p>
<p>I agree with you, but it&#8217;s possible, and maybe they&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>No one really &#8220;wants&#8221; Android without carriers shoving it down their throats, and consumers are turned away from WP7&#8217;s constrictive and unintuitive interface.  I think BBOS 10 will be extremely successful.</p>
<p>You should&#8217;ve stopped at &#8220;constrictive&#8221; b/c saying WP7&#8217;s interface is unintuitive invalidates much of anything you&#8217;re trying to say.</p>
<p>BB10 would have been a good direction a year ago, if it had ran the same apps as the playbook. They should have made the playbook 3g , and released around the same time as bb10 phones</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t have made a difference. The day the saw the iPhone in 2007, they should&#8217;ve been working on BB 10 instead of thinking that it was impossible to make.</p>
<p>More gloom from the media. Let&#8217;s see the finished product before final judgment is made.</p>
<p>No, the gloom is from the owners of the company &#8212; the shareholders. They are unable to convince anyone that their company has significant value in the modern mobile world, and those owners that wish to sell their shares must lower their price accordingly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that BlackBerry 10 is bad. It&#8217;s just 2 years late. Much like Windows 7, a potentially solid product that didn&#8217;t strike while the iron was hot (2007-2009). A lot has changed over the past 5 years, and only now is RIM doing anything about it&#8230;</p>
<p>I assume you mean Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he meant Window 7, otherwise he would have edit it&#8230;wait&#8230;</p>
<p>Investors is a hard bunch to please.</p>
<p>Yeah, seeing as how they like, ya know, successes and all.</p>
<p>I think the jury is still out, but it&#8217;s not encouraging what was unveiled. The OS doesn&#8217;t look slick or visually appealing, relatively speaking. Besides &#8220;true&#8221; multi-tasking, it doesn&#8217;t seem to have anything significant distinguishing feature. At least WP and PalmOS appeared to offer something a bit different and/or more visually appealing than competing products. It seems like before an ecosystem can become successful, consumers and developers have to have a reason to be excited about the prospects of the operating system, and that doesn&#8217;t appear to be the case with BB10. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens, but I think Blackberry&#8217;s decision to forge ahead on its current path rather than try to be acquired was a divisive one and will be one that is scrutinized for a long time.</p>
<p>Typo &#8211; I meant any instead of anything.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t look &#8220;slick&#8221;?  Have you ever tried browsing the full site of theverge on an android device and then tried it on a playbook or iPad?  There&#8217;s a world of difference.</p>
<p>How can you say that what was unveiled doesn&#8217;t look slick or visually appealing?  Everything they showed in the short demo was visually appealing and slick.  The whole &#8220;Flow&#8221; thing they talked about was awesome.  You know damn well that if the iPhone had some of those features you would be pretty excited (I know I would be).  Let&#8217;s be fair here and give credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>If you wanna say that you don&#8217;t think the product is close enough to be finished and polished on time, then sure, that&#8217;s a fair judgement.  But to say it is unintuitive, not slick, and not visually appealing is just unfair and completely biased.</p>
<p>BB reminds of a one hit wonders. Volvo comes to mind. Volvo&#8217;s were world renowned for safety and was the car of choice for families about 20-30 years ago. Nowadays, every car company makes safe cars, not just Volvo. BB has been coasting on their email backbone for way too long, without constantly innovating. Their golden goose is no longer, and they&#8217;re being found wanting</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because the market is being trolled by investors who either wanted a take-over so they needed a higher price to make up for not selling earlier &#8211; and it&#8217;s not happening &#8211; or a piecemeal sale of assets to generate short term profits and raise the value on &#8220;core BB&#8221; activities i.e. focus = value &#8211; and it&#8217;s not happening either in the short term. Maybe those who can&#8217;t man-up to the challenge of rebuilding RIM should seek short term value elsewhere while others can see opportunity. There&#8217;s also the ranting of those who want a cheap penny stock to play with instead of going to Vegas and playing Hold&#8217;em &#8211; yet they&#8217;re too cheap to buy a play ticket&#8230; there&#8217;s always the online casino! The past is the past &#8211; the &#8220;oh, it&#8217;s late, they should have done it before&#8221; statement has reached meme status at this point. Without perspective and time such an analysis is worthless.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve set in motion every single thing to make it work or die trying. Mobile Fusion MDM with support for iOS, Android and PB-BB, patching up their Playbook, new management, clean up of marketing and other top brass, a new OS that builds on some strong UI legacy and new trends, touch and ultimately keyboard devices, development devices for prototyping, original financial incentives for devs, licensing of nice features like the camera, etc. The execution is quite good up to now and we&#8217;ll see what they can deliver. Upstaging iOS or Android in the short term is a goal set by people who have an interest in RIM failing &#8211; in my opinion basically for getting the opportunity to acquire its IP portfolio. Yet there is a demand for a real &#8220;branded OS&#8221; that is more than simply a bland gateway to an app store, a desire for a renewed mobile experience &#8211; and I think for instance MS sees that. It takes time but in the end apps that simply accomplish something the OS should do in the first place or embed a function a browser should have don&#8217;t weigh much in my book &#8211; opinions vary. Security also remains a concern, as well as enterprise grade services, architecture and content delivery. There is tons of untamed value, stateside and abroad, and there is a place for a less elitist vision of competition in the mobile industry, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Very astute analysis.  Much more insightful than the usual fluffy tripe most tech blogs write.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>What did they reveal yesterday? Nothing! The hardware is not indicative of any phone, and the OS isn&#8217;t even really BlackBerry 10!  Smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>BB 10 will come out&#8230;. and it will do all of the things they say it will.</p>
<p>But&#8230; what will it do BETTER than Android or iOS? Or Windows Phone for that matter?</p>
<p>While I admit I only glanced at the articles from yesterday&#8217;s press events&#8230; I didn&#8217;t see anything that said I <strong>must</strong> get that phone.</p>
<p>Well for one it will actually scroll webpages smoothly and enable the battery to last for a full day.</p>
<p>Not trying to be a troll or an ass, but I do get that with my iPhone already.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that is has to do better than Ios Android or WP7. It&#8217;s that people have to believe it can be better.</p>
<p>The problem is that Blackberry is stuck in people&#8217;s head like a corporate only phone. A normal person wouldn&#8217;t want that now, would they?</p>
<p>And this core market of theirs has been hit really strong by the other 3 platforms. Add to it the fact that BB10 seems to be directed at consumers more..</p>
<p>Basically they&#8217;re in a fairly bit of mess due to where people believe they belong.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; a lot of normal people already <em>had</em> Blackberries at one time. I was one of them.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the case anymore&#8230; for me and many other people.</p>
<p>Check this out&#8230; I took this picture at a retreat in May 2010. It was funny seeing so many of my friends with Blackberries at the time.</p>
<p>But a lot has changed in 2 years&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VQ5Bl.jpg" /></p>
<p>Drowning in a cesspool polluted with their own filth.  They need to go back to making pagers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice overall, but it comes too late&#8230;</p>
<p>RIM is dead. The low stock price coming after the new release of BB10 just goes to show how little RIM get&#8217;s it and the investors know it.</p>
<p>RIM is in a very unique situation.   It is similar to Apple.  Apple controls the hardware, software and ecosystem.. RIM controls the hardware, software and ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, RIM management are oblivious to the world around them.  They are very late to the party (and MS are considered late!) to only bring out an alpha device (that&#8217;s not even close to the actual device) and then a keynote banging on about an OS that&#8217;s not even finished or even on the new phone devices they handed out to developers.</p>
<p>no innovation, no management no idea = lack of investor confidence.</p>
<p>Steve is gone, Apple hasn&#8217;t innovated all that much with the 4S, many policy and software security design issues have surfaced, yet the confidence is total. Your equation is simply not valid. Investors just seek immediate gratifications and predictable income and as little risk as possible. Sometimes what&#8217;s in the company&#8217;s interest is not the the stakeholder&#8217;s immediate interest &#8211; such is the case with RIM.</p>
<p>yes.. low risk. therefore RIM&#8217;s price at the moment is an indication that investors are shying from a company they see as risky.</p>
<p>yes.. low risk. therefore RIM&#8217;s price at the moment is an indication that investors are shying from a company they see as risky.I have been following AAPL since 2000, whilst the current rise is certainly meteoric, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean it&#8217;s overpriced.  in my honest opinion (and i know with hindsight anyone can say this) but I firmly believed AAPL was undervalued for a long time.</p>

None of the above you say are any indication that it would not have happened if Jobs was still on watch.  We&#8217;ll see in 12-18 months time how AAPL is faring.</p>
<p>My point was not that innovation or issues would have happened or not with Steve around, or that Apple&#8217;s stock isn&#8217;t dealt at a fair value or what not &#8211; I believe whatever Apple does the stock will be high &#8211; mostly because sales are high. Your initial point was that RIM&#8217;s stock went down because of management, lack of innovation, etc. I disagree and I&#8217;m just suggesting it went down, amongst other reasons I&#8217;ve dealt with in some post higher up in the thread, exactly for the opposite reason &#8211; it&#8217;s all new ideas, management, and innovation&#8230; but no further immediate cashflow.</p>
<p>ah yes, i see your point. it has to be an element of both I guess, all this new management make-over, innovation and design in progress but nothing tangible that can come from it for a while yet.</p>
<p>THAT looks like Metro UI.</p>
<p>Yeah it does. So apparently Metro/tiled UI is super bad, but other companies are copying it.</p>
<p>Pretty sure no one around here except the hardest of fan boys will say metro UI is bad. The general opinion is that the UI is great but that phone 7 has a poor implementation of it in terms of functionality. Not to mention phone 7 hardware specs are in the stone ages. It will be interesting to see if blackberry fixes any of these wrongs.</p>
<blockquote>The general opinion is that the UI is great but that phone 7 has a poor implementation of it in terms of functionality. </blockquote>
<p>you are not making sense.. Is it lacking functionality or poor implementation of functionality?</p>
<p>Both?</p>
<p>What about he/she  speaking for him/herself?</p>
<p>I recommend this because I thought it was funny.  I totally disagree though.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s hard to get? He said the UI is a great concept, but MS implemented it incorrectly&#8230;.</p>
<p>There is nothing like good UI poor implementation  .. UI and UX move hand in hand.  If a UI is implementation poorly then it ceases to be good .</p>
<p><strong>high fives</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happens when people think they know what they&#8217;re saying when they try to sound smart.</p>
<p>&#8217;mi right?</p>
<p>Wrong. There is such a thing as a good user interface that&#8217;s poorly implemented and/or lacks basic functions. They don&#8217;t always go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Imagine a super model. She&#8217;s smokin&#8217; hot. Long legs, perfect smile, great rack, and even silky smooth hair great for stroking and tugging.</p>
<p>Sounds great, right? As long as you can deal with her flaws. She has the mental faculty of a salad fork, she farts in public (then turns around to smell it), and she needs help walking. Not because she&#8217;s handicapped, she just can&#8217;t remember which foot goes first. Oh yeah, and she likes to pick her nose (and eat it) and loves the smell of her own urine so much she has it molded into candles. You know, to freshen up the house before guests arrive.</p>
<p>Great &#8220;user interface&#8221; poor implementation/functionality.</p>
<p>Sorry Windows Phone isn&#8217;t Fusion Garage&#8217;s GRID OS. Now that is a UI concept universally stated  implemented incorrectly !</p>
<p>WP7 may have some people who just hate it but it works tremendously well for everyone else.</p>
<p>Metro is bad. It&#8217;s a matter of taste and personally solid colors and monochrome icons and large text is boring and uninteresting.</p>
<p>I like its simplicity.</p>
<p>User experience before specs.</p>
<p>i dont think the issues with WP7 has been metro. Everyone seems to love</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more referring to Windows 8.</p>
<p>I was just going to say the same thing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a demo app created using Cascades</p>
<p>This. Some people aren&#8217;t realizing that this is a demonstration of the framework rather than how the OS is actually going to look.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot; &#8220;Cascades&#8221; is RIM&#8217;s shorthand for a set of developer tools and resources for building apps that fit the look, feel, and interaction models of BB10.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>This app is just an example, but it is a model for how apps are going to look AND feel. And this feels a lot damn like Metro. I think it&#8217;s something good, but I bet it is going to have a lot of metro-like UI influence</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that. Metro UI looks cool.</p>
<p>The second image (with the phone) looks like ICS !</p>
<p>looks more Holo-ish to me. (ICS)</p>
<p>Yea, I wonder if the Y-shaped &#8220;share&#8221; icon and the three horizontal lines for menu are considered universal&#8230; otherwise Google might not be pleased with it.</p>
<p>What does the &#8220;share&#8221; icon look like for WinPhone and iOS?</p>
<p>The closest on iOS is an arrow coming out of a box that represents a more general &#8220;Send To&#8221; instead of just &#8220;Share&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know about WP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Metro&#8217;s tile UI&#8221; isn&#8217;t necessarily unique. TAT has been working with similar design language as the one portrayed in MS Metro UI. Just look at their &#8220;Acute UI&#8221; which has similarities to the Metro UI MS is using today. Also, as someone who&#8217;ve been working with the TAT, I know that they&#8217;ve been using similar designs for demoing their UI engine for quite a while now.</p>
<p>Who the heck is TAT? is the question though.</p>
<p>The Astonishing Tribe (a company RIM bought).</p>
<p>Ahh I see! Thanks!</p>
<p>The images below also look a little like ICS. Who cares. Progress also means copying some of the great features others had, rather than reinventing the wheel. Apple did it too with the Android notifications, and so did Microsoft with webOS multi-tasking.</p>
<p>Now stop hating.</p>
<p>Actually, it looks Metropolitan (because the words aren&#8217;t truncat..</p>
<p><strong>swipe</strong></p>
<p>&#8230;ed)</p>
<p>Except that BB managed to fit the labels onto the screen instead of having them drift off to try and look hip and cool.</p>
<p>Very metro indeed, however it also reminds me of Symbian Belle</p>
<p><a href="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Symbian-Belle-UI11.jpg" target="_blank">http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Symbian-Belle-UI11.jpg</a></p>
<p>Some original ideas mixed with a lot of copying of Windows Phone? Not sold&#8230;but willing to listen to more. :)</p>
<p>webOS cards + Windows Phone sliding pages = BlackBerry 10</p>
<p>&#8230;actually that sounds pretty awesome&#8230;.</p>
<p>+ ICS color scheme and menu</p>
<p>Honestly I get a lot more of an &#8220;ICS with horizontal gesture navigation&#8221; than WP7.</p>
<p>I hope both Blackberry and Windows Phone do well.<br />
MORE CHOICE == MORE INNOVATION == MORE COMPETITION == CHEAPER AND BETTER DEVICES<br />
/CAPS</p>
<p>Imitation is&#8230;..</p>
<p>When you copy something.</p>
<p>Looks like WebOS + Android 4.0</p>
<p>Whoa they totally copied apple by using a white background&#8230; so lame dude.</p>
<p>It reminds me combination of Metro and Android UI mixed together. <br />
For me it seems strange decision to produce one more OS.</p>
<p>More OS&#8217;s are good!  This is an exciting time!  Unlike the personal computer industry where there have realistically been two options over the past 20 years: Windows or MAC.</p>
<p>If you ask me, Ubuntu is a better, more realistic choice than a mac. At least for enterprise.</p>
<p>I hardly doubt anyone cares.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking about client machines on enterprise desks then I&#8217;ve got to disagree. Step 1 of enterprise support is MS Office, the Mac has it and Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t therefore the Mac is the better choice.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking about servers in the enterprise then that&#8217;s a different subject and Linux is in general the better choice.</p>
<p>You mean realistic as walking into a best buy or walmart and purchasing a computer running Ubuntu?</p>
<p>How could you possibly be satisfied with freaking android as the only competitor to iOS?  The endless lag, the terrible battery life, the utter lack of updates and carrier bloat ware&#8230;  And you&#8217;re OKAY with that?  Christ no wonder Jobs said consumers have no idea what they want.</p>
<p>So after all this while RIM couldn&#8217;t come up anything original?</p>
<p>You&#8217;re expecting too much from them&#8230; LOL</p>
<p>the only nice thing was the keyboard..</p>
<p>This is just a mix of all! WebOS, ICS, Metro &amp; Symbian Belle.</p>
<p>If I wanted a phone that had them all&#8230; Wait! I DON&quot;T WANT THAT&#8230; I want my phone to be unique, not one that has a copy-cat feature.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d rather have a refined, working derivative of someone else&#8217;s feature than an unproven first implementation of a new one. Originality is overrated, especially if you&#8217;re looking for stability in a platform.</p>
<p>The Verge actually changed the picture at the beginning of this post. Originally the image they chose looked strikingly similar to the Metro UI.</p>
<p>Although I have to say the new image doesn&#8217;t inspire much confidence. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t choose it over the the big 3 as of now but I&#8217;ll reserve judgement until I see more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d choose almost anything over android just to get away from the lag and horrible battery management.</p>
<p>Nokia should&#8217;ve bought RIM and have the e-series phones = blackberry</p>
<p>Why should they have bought RIM? Had they done that they would have been losing even more money because Blackberry sales are dropping and Blackberry 10 phones still have no release date. It looks decent but i think their partnership with Microsoft was a very good idea and i am looking forward to the Nokia Windows Phone 8 handsets.</p>
<p>Technically it&#8217;s not a bad fit. BB10 and Symbian/MeeGo Harmattan use Qt for developing apps. QNX isn&#8217;t UNIX but it&#8217;s similar enough that there would be some sharing with Nokia&#8217;s MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan, earlier Maemo and rumored Linux based Meltemi pones.</p>
<p>From RIM&#8217;s point of view, getting a foothold in markets the iPhone can&#8217;t compete in would be good too on cheaper Nokias in emerging markets. Windows Phone can&#8217;t go that low either whereas a cheap Blackberry is quite possible. Of course, some Chinese manufacturer will undercut everyone with a barely useable, disposable Adroid object-pretending&#8212;to-be-a-phone.</p>
<p>Do we really need another ecosystem?</p>
<p>So is this the next big thing that Apple should &#8220;wake up&#8221; to?</p>
<p>Well they blew it. They had one chance to grab everyone&rsquo;s attention and leave an image, but they failed.</p>
<p>You posted those four words before I could.</p>
<p>I was waiting for two things during the game &ndash; Destiny&rsquo;s Child and which ad was going to suck more &ndash; BlackBerry or the talking baby stock trader (that ad idea needs to die like 4 years ago). DC was great and BB BBBlows.</p>
<p>OK, I just saw the Beck&rsquo;s Sapphire beer ad. This one takes the trophy for the worst &ndash; and creepiest &ndash; ad of the Game. A singing goldfish &ndash; WTFingF?</p>
<p>Although I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if BB offered to sponsor Beck after BBs ad stunk it up.</p>
<p>Naaahhh Dodge definitely takes the cake.</p>
<p>That one was bad, but it could not possibly top that horribly cheesy and over-the-top Jeep ad with the heroic &ldquo;Support Our Troops&rdquo; message and the Oprah voiceover.</p>
<p>Jeep: Owned By Fiat might not have gone down so well I suppose.</p>
<p>I liked that and I hate Dodge and am not religious.</p>
<p>Pretty much.</p>
<p>Are you a farmer?</p>
<p>No but I do live in a farming community.</p>
<p>Not only that, but it was singing the great 1996 Blackstreet song &ldquo;No Diggity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That was a work of unintentional genius.</p>
<p>The Budweiser horse fetish one was pretty awful</p>
<p>The Destiny&rsquo;s Child gals were quite hot. I was waiting for the wardrobe malfunction. Disappointed!!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d learn from Apple&rsquo;s iPhone marketing campaign and air a commercial that simply shows, close up, what their phone and new OS can do.</p>
<p>Instead, they created a gimmicky commercial that shows the phone half of the time, distant and obscured for the other half, and doing irrelevant things.</p>
<p>And they plan to spend several hundreds of million dollars on this sort of marketing? My God, it&rsquo;s almost as if they&rsquo;re asking for a swift corporate death.</p>
<p>I wonder if the person who came up with the superheros thought this one too. They didn&rsquo;t even need to follow apple&rsquo;s root. They didn&rsquo;t even have to go into details about the phone. What they needed to do was having a unique image for their phones. That commercial, was all over the place without a clear cut theme.</p>
<p>I completely agree.  I&rsquo;ve been following BB10 for months and was disappointed.  The OS has a lot to offer, but that add illustrates that blackberry still just doesn&rsquo;t quite get it.  People want to at least <span class="caps">SEE</span> the phone and OS.</p>
<p>Lets be fair here, no matter <span class="caps">WHAT</span> the ad showed, it would still be crapped on.  Seriously!</p>
<p>I dont think the ad was great, but then what <span class="caps">WOULD</span>?  An ad costing millions of dollars to show off a specific new Blackberry 10 feature?  I mean, even if Blackberry had something that would look &ldquo;cool&rdquo; in an ad like Siri or Google Now, it would be written off by geeks as &ldquo;just a &hellip;.. clone!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I didnt like the ad either :-)</p>
<p>I change my mind, had it shown more of the actual phone right at the end, so we actually got a good look at &ldquo;The New Blackberry!  Zee 10!  All new, from Blackberry!  The Zee 10!&rdquo;, then that would have been ok.</p>
<p>Start us off with an entree of humour, make us pay attention&hellip;..then give us the tofu of the ad, let us know &ldquo;hey, this isnt actually an Android phone or the new iPhone, its Blackberry!&rdquo;.  Give us five seconds minimum of cool looking menus and screens, transitions, make it look &ldquo;high tech&rdquo;&hellip;..flick back to the guy using the device in his hand smiling while the wacky stuff from before floats away or whatever, then end on &ldquo;<span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span>&rdquo; across the screen.  <span class="caps">DONE</span>.</p>
<p>You just described the most forgettable, boring commercial in the history of advertising.</p>
<p>Please, I have no hopes for Blackberry, I&rsquo;m an iOS user through and through (Galaxy Nexus and Nokia N9 soon to run Jellybean on the side) but we were never going to give Blackberry a fair chance on <span class="caps">WHATEVER</span> they ran instead.</p>
<p>For an example, look at Apples original hype ad for the Original iPhone back in 2007, clips from movies featuring a telephone&hellip;..its simple, doesnt actually <span class="caps">SHOW</span> you the product, and yet gets you interested.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msjYiiumjWg" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msjYiiumjWg</a></p>
<p>I suggested a tweak to the ad Blackberry ran.  You might not think its all that great, but ante up yourself and give an example of a mindblowing ad that Blackberry could have run, whatever would have impressed &ldquo;GodShapedHole&rdquo; on The Verge forums :-)</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t air purely descriptive ads showing what the product does while a calm voice narrates what you are seeing during the Superbowl.</p>
<p>The thing about Apple is that they can get away with certain things others cannot because of different expectations in brand and brand communications. People have pre-conceived notions about brands, so even if Apple just shows bouncy iPods, you&rsquo;ll have people hailing it as brilliant. Why? Well, it&rsquo;s <span class="caps">APPLE</span> and Apple is brilliant! What&rsquo;s more, if somebody else takes a page from their playbook, that wouldn&rsquo;t just be boring but derivative, too.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t like this BB ad all that much. It came across trying too hard and didn&rsquo;t connect me to the product or the brand image. But showing a person using the product with short snippets of the UI isn&rsquo;t just a bad Superbowl ad; it&rsquo;s a bad ad, period. It&rsquo;s slow and boring. It doesn&rsquo;t capture anyone&rsquo;s imagination. And I think it&rsquo;s better to try and end up with a noble failure than to just do some half-assed, purely descriptive ad.</p>
<p>I can only imagine Blackberry to be a really difficult client to work for. But even if Blackberries sold themselves and the ad was just supposed to remind people to buy the newest one now, you don&rsquo;t create an ultra-high profile ad of the sort shown during the Superbowl in five free minutes spent replying on a messageboard ;-)</p>
<p>I would really like to hear your outline of how their ad could be tweaked (I gave my suggestion, you hated it) or replaced entirely.  Just a short couple sentences would do :-)</p>
<p>I think the ad could have been &ldquo;fun and unexpected&rdquo; and <span class="caps">THEN</span> made an explicitly clear <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span> ad.  It would have a title screen, white text on all black <span class="caps">BLACKBERRY</span>.  Own the ad, own your product, pimp your brand, make people know you are back!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give this as an example, Palm Pixi, the shittiest phone from a failing company ever, right?  It should never have existed, they needed a new high end Pre to compete with iPhone 3GS and Nexus One, Galaxy S etc.  And instead the company kept borrowing millions to make smaller and crappier specced phones, the absolute polar opposite to what they needed!</p>
<p><span class="caps">BUT</span>, this ad makes me want to buy one of the tiny screened, keyboarded bastards right now!  It hypes what you can do if you dream, in a simulated way, movement, creativity, and then bluntly tells you it&rsquo;s the new Palm Pixi on Sprint.</p>
<p>I bet five minutes from now you will <span class="caps">STILL</span> be humming the tune of the Passionpit song!  Memorable ad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBKzy01Xh8g" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBKzy01Xh8g</a></p>
<p>I personally think the Blackberry phone advertised doesn&rsquo;t have a hope in hell.  But the ad could be fairly decent.</p>
<p>I was thinking they would make a really exciting ad demonstrating some great new features of the phone with the phrase &lsquo;The Black is back&rsquo;..</p>
<p>Shit they could&rsquo;ve just gone the emotion tugging route (check out Google&rsquo;s ad for G+ where they had all sort of scenarios of people using the service, I was blown away by that ad) giving a brief history of Blackberry. Ya know, get some nostalgia going.</p>
<p>The goal of advertising is to have your product or brand talked about. Looks like that is happening here. Mission accomplished, the fact that some didn&rsquo;t or did like the video doesn&rsquo;t even matter.</p>
<p>Or looking at it the other way, you&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d have learned from the Motorola Xoom. Remember that?</p>
<p>that was just a very odd ad.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; It did grab attention by showing &ldquo;<span class="caps">WTF</span> is that all about?!?!?!&rdquo;.<br />
The Nexus7 ad was much better than anything I can remember.</p>
<p>The one with a small plastic tablet thats wifi-only going camping?</p>
<p>A) It&rsquo;s not WiFi only now, is it?<br />
B) They were in the back yard the whole time.</p>
<p><em>what their phone and new OS can do</em></p>
<p>I guess &ldquo;can do about what other smartphones can, in a good day, if you&rsquo;re lucky&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t that compelling as a message.</p>
<p>My Sister, not sure if she liked it, said &ldquo;So, I think, even if you have a BlackBerry, you can&rsquo;t stop a Truck&rdquo;</p>
<p>hahaha. Anyway I&rsquo;m not sure, It was surprisingly conceptual, I wanted a better story or joke. Anyway I think the message is interesting I but expected more from <span class="caps">BBDO</span>.</p>
<p>Oreo one is fricking awesome!</p>
<p>Why only one chance? I don&rsquo;t think so, taking into account that they are international company and super bowl is a <span class="caps">USA</span> event.<br />
I didn&rsquo;t like the ad much, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a make or break thing. What is bad for BB is that they are too late to the market with this phone. They were leaders in time of first iPhone vs BB bold competition (I chose bold). Up to now they had that same bold and apple moved a lot. Now they are trying to catch up but I thinks it&rsquo;s too late, let&rsquo;s see if they survive.</p>
<p>Amazingly weak ad! Had zero pop.</p>
<p>Another goddamnit example if companies not knowing how to reach out. This is currently Microsoft&#8217;s dilemma with the Surface, Sony&#8217;s overall issue and just a lack of focus.</p>
<p>Companies! Just tell people what your product does!</p>
<p>i agree, but problem is, that confuses the masses. most people are ignorant to anything other than the kardashian&rsquo;s latest tweet, lil wayne&rsquo;s newest &lsquo;song&rsquo;, or who is dating who. that is why most ads go with style over substance.</p>
<p>i mean, how many times have you heard somebody describe a super bowl commercial and not even be able to tell you what product or service was actually being advertised? unfortunately style trumps substance, and it&rsquo;s only going to get worse.</p>
<p>shit covered in sprinkles still tastes like shit.</p>
<p>People have always told me which commercial they liked by identifying the company the ad is advertising&hellip; ie: last years Fiat ad.</p>
<p>always?</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve often heard people just discuss &lsquo;that funny commercial&rsquo; and never bother to mention the product. i guess that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s not always brought up.</p>
<p>One, it&rsquo;s pretty well know among marketers that at Super Bowls &ldquo;funny&rdquo; tends to grab the most attention or something seriously dramatic. Like i think star wars kid last year hit the funny, the etrade baby adds. i think the first Apple 1984 ad was a superbowl ad and it hit that dramatic note. I think this year the bud ads with stevie wonder hit the funny to me. I think that farmers ad was pretty good and hit the drama. Granted i wasn&rsquo;t paying a ton of attention to the commercial, and maybe part of it is my crush on Zoe Saldana but i still thought the punchlines were funny (not lucky chair anymore).</p>
<p>But if this was designed to peak interest i don&rsquo;t think it did. I think most people absolutely missed it. It could have been an insurance company ad.</p>
<p>And as for &ldquo;swagger&rdquo; and &ldquo;style over substance&rdquo; honestly i don&rsquo;t see either. That&rsquo;s not swagger. Stevie Wonder dressed in a white suit, white top hat, in a secret speak easy casting voodoo spells while snapping his fingers and making leggy movie stars appear? Now that is swagger. That is style. You gotta have some swagger to attempt to pull of a white suit.</p>
<p>my issue is it was simply boring. If you didn&rsquo;t know a new phone was being debuted, a supposed new era in blackberry you&rsquo;d have yawned past that commercial. At least they didn&rsquo;t have a scary girl like Palm but i just thought it did a horrible job attracting attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies! Just tell people what your product does!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No&hellip; I don&rsquo;t need to know what it does by watching a 30 sec ad. I want for them to tell us why they think we should buy their stuff.</p>
<p>Reiterative point?  Personally I want to buy a device that is useful, so &ldquo;why they think we should buy their stuff&rdquo; damn well better include &ldquo;what your product does&rdquo; or I&rsquo;m not interested.  Funny but irrelevant commercials don&rsquo;t do anything to convince me to drop a stack of Benjis on a metal and plastic brick of questionable usefulness.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what I just watched, nor do I watch sports.</p>
<p>I kinda liked it.</p>
<p>Me too. It was clever. Something that hasn&rsquo;t been done by Apple or Samsung.</p>
<p>What the hell was clever about that!?!</p>
<p>I think the idea was good but they completely missed the execution&hellip;</p>
<p>The idea of what? To not show one damn thing about the phone they&rsquo;re trying to sell?</p>
<p>The idea that it has &ldquo;soooooo&rdquo; many features and can do everything. The idea, however, is pushing it. They&rsquo;re up against other phones that are much better, and do more, and have larger ecosystems. They took the &ldquo;we&rsquo;re better, srsly&rdquo; route, and it&rsquo;s a dumb one when nobody (nobody!) knows your product.</p>
<p>microsoft at least saturates us with their OS and shows features. they know the new product needs to be front and center.</p>
<p>Except, consumers still don&rsquo;t know what it can do.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the only ad they will run, this is the Superbowl ad.  Trust me, there will be ads where features are touted.  The company is betting on BB10, so they will give it much more marketing.  Superbowl ads aren&rsquo;t reasonable, they are meant to have people talking about it at the water cooler the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How &rsquo;bout that commercial where the phone turns the truck in duckies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really loved the commercial and found it entertaining, but I doubt it piqued a lot of curiosity in average consumers.  We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>To come up with funny things that the phone appears to be doing, then imply that the list of things it can do is so long that its easier to list what it can&rsquo;t. You have to remember this is an ad for the Super Bowl, it has to appeal to the masses. A listing of features doesn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
<p>Thank you! To add to this, marketing research has shown that funny/weird ads are more easily remembered, thus creating a higher probability of the average consumer to think favorably when they spot the product while shopping.</p>
<p>But the ad didn&rsquo;t show me anything that the phone does.  I&rsquo;m not intrigued at all, because all I saw was another glitzy commercial in the midst of a dozen other ones.  It wasn&rsquo;t memorable in any way, and didn&rsquo;t showcase anything about their new device.  BB missed the mark, and hard.</p>
<p>Sounds like an idea dreamed up by people nowhere near as smart as they think they are. I&rsquo;m sure they got paid well for it, though.</p>
<p>Nice try, director of marketing for Blackberry.</p>
<p>Damn, you got me.</p>
<p>Clever would be if they have shown what the phone could do, like Josh with JF, where he shows (in probably 30 seconds or less) how the phone has a cool feature with the camera and the face recognition (the feature where you take a photo and then can change the face later), the audience there was cheering for the z10 because it can do something interesting, and new in a simple way. I bet an ad showing that feature would stay more with people, this.. this you forget by the next ad.</p>
<p><span class="caps">THIS</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also something new at this point.</p>
<p>I mean, if you&rsquo;ve been following the last year of development conference videos and reviews, you <strong>know</strong> what the devices can do already &ndash; you know the touchscreen keyboard device is launching soon (Or already has, if your from Europe), and reviews cover the functionality of peek and flow, and time shift, etc.</p>
<p>If all they get is 30 seconds, saying what the phone <strong>can&rsquo;t</strong> do is succinct, and to the selling point of &ldquo;It does a lot of stuff your phone can&rsquo;t already do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What!?!</p>
<p>That is an awful, awful ad. :(</p>
<p>Eh, didn&rsquo;t really grab my attention. Not that good.</p>
<p>The ad sucks. It didn&rsquo;t impress me anything.</p>
<p>..&ldquo;it&rsquo;s better to show you what it can&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blackberry Doesn&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>what kinda of PR team presents their product with something they <span class="caps">CANT</span> do without showing what it can actually do?</p>
<p>Considering all the rest of their marketing material is what it can do&hellip;</p>
<p>It would be boring.</p>
<p>They get to say &ldquo;This phone does anything you&rsquo;d want it to do, except these overblown capabilities. Sorry, no <span class="caps">TARDIS</span> phone yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, now that I think of it&hellip;</p>
<p>I seem to remember one of the Tomb Raider&rsquo;s doing a joke advertisement point about &ldquo;Sorry, no nude code&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Same basic premise &ndash; &ldquo;What does it have? Well, it&rsquo;d be simpler to say what it <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> have, because to do so we&rsquo;d essentially have to go into the realm of impossible things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, the fact that we&rsquo;re on here and you&rsquo;re on here commenting about an &lsquo;ad&rsquo; that was just shown hours ago is&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. well, I dunno. I&rsquo;d call it &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; perhaps? Good buzz and bad buzz but the overall level of &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; is higher due to this ad. I think that may be its point. Ludicrous ads can stand out because they are ludicrous. Perhaps the angle of being so absurd in presenting an ad that has nothing to do with it probably sets a lot of people off. Gets them posting it on their twitter, facebook and blog accounts and creates more buzz. I am guessing of course but, well, if they saw that far ahead and it seems to be unravelling that way then good for them.</p>
<p>Yeeeeaaa no. Palm was saying the same thing about those creepoid ads they first aired at the Pre debut a few years ago and it didn&rsquo;t make a difference.</p>
<p>Aaaaaah I see. So because it didn&rsquo;t work for Palm that must mean it&rsquo;s not going to work here? Awesome to know.</p>
<p>Well,&#8230; that commercial was really stupid.  That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re on the brink of bankruptcy. They&#8217;re stupid.</p>
<p>The ad hardly focused on the phone almost like they were hiding it, it didn&#8217;t showcase what the z10 could do, the song choice was horrible, what exactly does the ad mean ? What&#8217;s it really trying to say ? Do I need a 27th level intellect to understand it ? Can we get a member of the illuminati to decode it ? :(</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly</p>
<p>I think the ad was actually okay, This is the super bowl which is US centric and the new BlackBerrys would not be available in the US till March at best, so this ad I believe is just to create an awareness for BlackBerry in the US not necessarily talk about what features it has. Blackberry has lost a lot of mindshare in the US. This might just help. Whether or not people think the ad is stupid or a waste, it does succeed in creating awareness for the company.</p>
<p>Yeah, you&rsquo;re right about the timing. There&rsquo;s no point building up a ton of hype if the Z10 isn&rsquo;t hitting the U.S. for another month. &ldquo;Hurry up and wait&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a particularly helpful message; piquing interest should work more in their favour.</p>
<p>Except that any &lsquo;awareness&rsquo; would be obliterated by late February when Mobile World Congress 2013 rolls around and <span class="caps">HTC</span>, Sony, Motorola, LG et al are showing off their shiny new phones. Nokia has an event for Feb 25th where you just <span class="caps">KNOW</span> that some awesome camera tech will get shown off. Nvidia will be showing off lots more Tegra 4 hardware and stunning game demos. Qualcomm et al will follow suit. Every single media vehicle in America will be showing loads of news from <span class="caps">MWC</span>.</p>
<p>They blew it.</p>
<p>Nope, do you actually believe this is the only ad you will see from BlackBerry?? Before its launch even at the time of the Mobile World congress, BlackBerry news is not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>It is like they are actively trying to fail</p>
<p>Pay $ 4 million for 30 seconds of shit. Bravo BlackBerry.</p>
<p>plus what they paid to produce it in the first place.</p>
<p>&mdash;That&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s what I missed?</p>
<p>The only reason people will even mention this ad is to discuss how lousy it was.  No one will be mentioning it as one of the best ads.</p>
<p>Sorry to all the iSheep but it was already rated as <strong>the</strong> best ad:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/and-your-favorite-super-bowl-ad-was-2013-2#ixzz2JxJoLxvk" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/and-your-favorite-super-bowl-ad-was-2013-2#ixzz2JxJoLxvk</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no iSheep, thank you very much.  And here&rsquo;s an interesting quote from your article:  &ldquo;We should note that a lot of voters came from CrackBerry.com, the BlackBerry fan website.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was watching this with about 20 college age kids. They almost unanimously said it was the best commercial so far. Don&rsquo;t think any of them will be switching though.</p>
<p>Really? Did they even know what the commercial was about? Don&#8217;t believe that. I keep up with tech and was wondering what the f it was</p>
<p>The Oreo commercial was one of the best.  I liked the Dodge one about the farmers too; that was well done.  The BB one didn&rsquo;t even register.</p>
<p>I really liked it. I mean, all smartphones on the market can pretty much do the same and I find it rather stupid to get a camera or a calendar explained in an ad. This is clever and entertaining.</p>
<p>I tend to agree. What could they have shown in an ad that would look attractive? Blackberry Hub, while useful, doesn&rsquo;t have a mass market appeal. Neither does &ldquo;real multitasking&rdquo;. Maybe it&rsquo;s a failure on Blackberry&rsquo;s part that they don&rsquo;t have any standout feature, but I think they should get credit for making a solid OS (albeit late). I do wish they showed off more of the phone though. It just looked like a generic prop phone.</p>
<p>PS. On second thought, they could have showed off the camera editing feature for faces. However that&rsquo;s still one feature. I think they should have skipped the Superbowl and made a series of short ads showing features just like Apple for the iPhone.</p>
<p>Then why should I get a BB10 device instead of an iPhone, Android or WP8 smartphone?</p>
<p>Great Commercial. The superbowl watching audience don&rsquo;t want to see a tutorial on how to use BB10 as a commercial. They want something quick and amusing which this commercial delivers. It does enough to put the word out there that there is a new Blackberry phone.<br />
In the coming weeks, they might release commercials with details on how to use the features.</p>
<p>It could be an ad for any phone out there. I bet most of the general public won&rsquo;t even remember the brand.</p>
<p>You are probably right.  Should have put blackberry for a bit longer, instead the audience was still figuring out what the heck just happened to that truck.</p>
<p>At the Office Cooler&hellip;.<br /> Hey, did you see the commercial last night, with the phone and the truck?<br /> Yeah, what was that about?  Was that a new Samsung?</p>
<p>It was more entertaining than Beyonce!</p>
<p>Someone&rsquo;s an RJD2 fan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h2c6m-U2x8">Smoke and Mirrors</a></p>
<p>The Point Of The Ad is to be funny or Clever in a way, the Samsung Ad did the same, no one cares about what the phone can do during a Super Bowl Commercial, That&rsquo;s Not what Super Bowl Commercial are about, now this was clever</p>
<p>what the hell was that?? Z10 promoted like this&hellip;..BB what the heck is <span class="caps">WRONG</span> with you??</p>
<p>Is <span class="caps">ANYONE</span> excited about the Z10? There is nothing compelling about it. It&rsquo;s a fucking run of the mll smartphone and nothing more. It has no advantage over iPhone, android, or WP. I&rsquo;m sorry, but Blackberry will be joining Palm very soon in defunked mobile OS heaven.</p>
<p>It <span class="caps">DOES</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> need to have a compelling feature over ios or android, it just needs to present itself as a viable option.</p>
<p>The Palm talk is getting old.. Please let it go</p>
<p>Just like WP8?  How&rsquo;s that working out for MS?  MS is a huge company with deep pockets, and can afford to tread water for a couple quarters until they get traction.  Can BB do the same?</p>
<p>Ha, a windows phone comparison! how many ads have you seen on wp8 since it was launched in the states?? This is BlackBerrys first ad for their phones, yet you compare them because..?? if the phones where released at the same time I can understand. Your comments are invalid.<br />
 Also BlackBerry has more brand awareness than WP8&hellip; and this is not treading the water, this is advertising which is effectively working seeing as everyone is talking about it.</p>
<p>Are you still drunk? Microsoft can afford to not have WP8 be a success because they have like 8+ billion dollar (and very profitable businesses) that they can fall back on until they can get some great features/updates onto the platform. Blackberry doesn&rsquo;t have that luxury, and you know it. And on what planet do you live on where everyone is talking about blackberry?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think BB&rsquo;s goal was to get everyone on a tech website, who already know all about BB10 and the Z10, talking about how poor their commercial was.  If it was their goal, then they&rsquo;ve slid farther than I imagined.  BB is doing worse than treading water.  They&rsquo;re actively sinking and swinging for the bleachers with BB10.  It&rsquo;s just 2 years too late.  The momentum has swung, and they have nothing to offer to halt that now.</p>
<p>Wrong. It <span class="caps">DOES</span> have to have compelling features over iOS or android. If it doesn&rsquo;t, people will not find reason to switch.</p>
<p>Blackberry can&rsquo;t survive as a fringe company selling 1-2million phones a year. They need to sell A <span class="caps">LOT</span> of phones to stay in the game. If they don&rsquo;t garner a significant market share, they won&rsquo;t get the app developers. And if they don&rsquo;t get the developers, they fail.</p>
<p>Thus they need to be a more compelling option, not just another option.</p>
<p>So you believe with their current new phones, they would just sell 1-2million phones a year, all because you think they have nothing different to offer?? :O?</p>
<p>They are going to sell <span class="caps">WAY</span> more than 1-2 million this year.</p>
<p>You have already accurately stated what they need to do to carry out, and thats what they are doing. Its not a work in the park. But for you to write them off like what they have brought to the table is completely useless compared to the competition is where I see fault in your argument.<br />
 They already have most of the basic day to day apps(yes the apps may not the popular ones on iOS or Android but they still get the job done perfectly). Sure people heavily invested in iOS or android would not likely change, but not everyone is tied to that segment or tied down to an ecosystem and new people keep getting on new smartphones every year. The mobile  market is very very dynamic, things will change.<br />
 They just need be a viable choice in the market. I cant see anything they are doing right now that should be done differently.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But for you to write them off like what they have brought to the table is completely useless compared to the competition is where I see fault in your argument.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>This is not my argument.  I am arguing that they brought nothing <span class="caps">BETTER</span> to the table.  Nothing of any significance.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;They just need be a viable choice in the market.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>WebOS was just a viable choice.  In fact, it was a pretty great foundation.  But it was too little, too late.  Whether or not you choose to see the parallels is up to you, but Blackberry&rsquo;s latest effort feels a lot like WebOS when it was acquired by HP.  Just like Palm, <span class="caps">RIMM</span> let their marketshare jump off a cliff before they decided to wake up and do something about it.  They have no one to blame but themselves!</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I cant see anything they are doing right now that should be done differently.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Look harder.  Making a phone that looks eerily like the iPhone (yes this is subjective) is not revolutionary.  They needed to wow, or at least change the conversation in some way.  Microsoft attempted to do this with Windows phone 8, and the surfaces.  Windows 8 is dramatically different than the competition, and Surface is trying to be a Tablet/PC hybrid rather than going toe to toe with the iPad.</p>
<p>Look, I&rsquo;m sorry to be so harsh, but the truth is <span class="caps">RIMM</span> brought this on themselves! They clung to Blackberry 7 way too long, and put on their blinders while the rest of the industry went lightyears ahead.  They put their efforts into the failed Playbook, instead of redirecting their efforts into building a better Blackberry OS.  And 5 years later, they release an OS that offers no significant advantage to what is already out there.  Mark my words, Blackberry will not exist 2 years from today.  Blackberry 10 will fail, and they will either be bought out and dissolved, or just fade away.  I hate to see people loose their jobs, but I will bet money on them going out of business in 1-2years.</p>
<p>I will take your bet then, by exactly 4th of Feb. 2015. we&rsquo;ll see what happens.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re on!</p>
<p>Obviously millions of Blackberry fans are. I personally know one of them (he&rsquo;s, uhm, really enthusiastic. I personally label him the <i>Blackberry Free Advertising Division</i>).</p>
<p>Anyways, I am too, actually. It does have the advantage of being a lot more crash safe, being ultrasecure, it&rsquo;s fast, it integrates everything really well in the Hub (I&rsquo;ve seen &ndash; better than Windows Phone, Android, or iOS), and most of all, it&rsquo;s different. Being different really is a big catch. I personally like it because it&rsquo;s a different workflow than using any of the three main mobile platforms right now.</p>
<p>I do wish they prettied up the UI though. It&rsquo;s kind of meh to me UI wise. The phones are good/great (black and white colours, respectively).</p>
<p>The hub is going to get super cluttered.  I don&rsquo;t need my FB and Twitter in the same area as my text messages and emails.  It&rsquo;ll cause a massively high signal:noise ratio.</p>
<p>You would think that, but existing blackberries have something similar (everything in one place) and it works quite well (for me at least). You can also customize what appears in the main view so you don&rsquo;t have to have twitter and facebook cluttering your workflow.</p>
<p>I had mine 3 days and had to do a battery pull every day because some part of the OS froze. One was actually the settings menu. &ldquo;a lot more crash safe&rdquo; it definitely isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A battery pull everyday?? lol that is a lie, but if it true, its a device problem, take it back to your carriers or contact BlackBerry tech support (or try a device swipe?). They will be able to help you, coming here to complain would not take the need to do a &ldquo;battery-pull&rdquo; away.</p>
<p>Factual comment. Do <span class="caps">NOT</span> accuse me of lying. And I didn&rsquo;t come here to complain, merely to comment. It froze on the carrier screen, it froze on the settings menu and I really can&rsquo;t remember what the third one was. I used it for long enough to decide that it doesn&rsquo;t do anything better than the currently available opposition and in a lot of cases is significantly worse. Maybe at some point in the future they&rsquo;ll get it right given enough time which they may or may not have. Given the amount of development time I expected something better. Made a tidy profit from selling the thing anyway (wish I&rsquo;d bought more).</p>
<p>From a marketing standpoint the ad was successful.  Sure, tech nerds like The Verge want to see options and features being thrown at the screen, but that would put most people to sleep and is generally not catching.  All the audience needs to be aware of is that there&rsquo;s a new BlackBerry on the market.</p>
<p>People who want to know more will do their research online or in-store before buying.  Honestly, when was the last time anyone bought a new phone solely based on the television ad?</p>
<p>iPhone. Sad but true.</p>
<p>Anyone else notice all the blackberries in House of Cards? BB needs to do more of that type of marketing.. make owning a BB cool again.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re used by politicians. I can&rsquo;t imagine that makes the phone cool. The reporter uses an iPhone. Anyway, great show, I&rsquo;ve watched the first 3 episodes.</p>
<p>I knew what the commercial was about&hellip;but afterwards I was pissed they didn&rsquo;t explain the Z10 anymore.  How is the average consumer being introduced to BB10 that way?</p>
<p>Swagger wasn&rsquo;t what came to mind &ndash; more like pure dumb.</p>
<p>It was the stupider thing i&rsquo;ve ever saw.  It was complete idiot.</p>
<p>Not sure if you&rsquo;re trying to be cleaver, but using &ldquo;stupider&rdquo; indicates something more about you than the commercial&hellip;  (ducks shoe flying in my direction)</p>
<p>If you want to see the phone in action then check out this ad from Bell. <a href="http://youtu.be/xR_FIPbD6Ms" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/xR_FIPbD6Ms</a></p>
<p>Same level of crap as the genius ads apple did not too long ago</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what Alicia Keys is doing there&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, and that guy is on fiyaaaaaaaaa&hellip; That guys is on fiyaaaaaa-ooohhh.</p>
<p>This fan made video was better. m.youtube.com/watch?v=dY1ecfWT3GQ</p>
<p>That commercial was pretty bad ass.</p>
<p>That commercial actually piqued my curiosity in BB10. It really made it look like BlackBerry was turning a page and becoming something cutting edge rather than its old, antiquated batch of phones. Would have rather seen that than what they actually put out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but for some reason it&rsquo;s all about what its new Z10 handset &ldquo;can&rsquo;t&rdquo; do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Running any old BB ad from the last 5 years could have shown what a BB " couldn&rsquo;t  do"</p>
<p>It should have just been a montage of all the crucial 3rd party apps it doesn&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t ever have.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that this was a very generic commercial &ndash; it could just as easily have been a commercial for a new <span class="caps">HTC</span> or Sony or Nokia phone. Heck, something about it made it feel like a Samsung commercial to me.</p>
<p>For a company that&rsquo;s rebranding and launching a new era of products that people need to be familiarized with &ndash; this is a total failure.</p>
<p>This, I think, was the biggest issue&hellip; I think alot of people are going to remember it as the one with the ducks, not the Blackberry commercial. There was nothing Blackberry about it.</p>
<p>I thought it was funny. But, as someone who wanted a Z10 until the BB10 launch, this commercial shows me that I am right choosing a Nokia Lumia over this phone.</p>
<p>With the lack of substance, I don&rsquo;t find how this justified or unjustified the your choice of whatever phone you bought.</p>
<p>Sooooo&hellip; you see an actual product they want people to by for about &hellip;.. 2 seconds. Well done, Blackberry.  It was nice knowing you. Everyone had a lot of hope for you.</p>
<p>That ad was actually great <span class="caps">IMHO</span>. Taking the route of &ldquo;our device is so good and feature packed that showing you all the things it can do would take so long that we&rsquo;ll show you what it can&rsquo;t&rdquo; is fairly bold. They only had so much time during the super bowl ad and I&rsquo;m sure turning a truck into rubber ducks, a guy with 3D animal legs, and bursting into dust is far more interesting that showing off a few features. They wouldn&rsquo;t be able to compete with any of the other ads.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure about advertising that doesn&rsquo;t show the product or its features. Showing the phone for 3 seconds at the end isn&rsquo;t convincing me of anything either.</p>
<p>You are on a tech blog. You aren&rsquo;t going to be convinced from a commercial&hellip;</p>
<p>Looks like BlackBerry is still sleeping.</p>

<p>Strange how they didn&rsquo;t mention how it can&rsquo;t even connect to a <span class="caps">BES</span> 5 server</p>
<p>The average person reading the verge probably doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between <span class="caps">BES</span> 5, <span class="caps">BES</span> 10, and <span class="caps">BIS</span>. Let alone the average person watching the superbowl&hellip;</p>
<p>You all might hate it&hellip; But I think it&rsquo;s going to get a great response. I thought it was clever compared to most others.</p>
<p>BlackBerry can&rsquo;t seem to get over being &ldquo;torched&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Good ad, bad ad, it really makes no difference. Other than a few rabid, diehard fanboys and a bunch of Canadians, no one is going to switch (or switch back) to bb. BB10 may not be <span class="caps">DOA</span>, but it&#8217;s certainly straight to intensive care with very little chance of survival, let alone success.</p>
<p>I dunno, I think there is more want for Blackberry than you think. In the UK almost all of the available Z10 phones have sold out. UK is a much smaller market that does favor Blackberry but that is a good sign for <span class="caps">BBRY</span>.</p>
<p>But how many units were available? And what does &ldquo;almost sold out&rdquo; mean?</p>
<p>THe add was pretty bad, probably worst than the dancing surface commercials.  So dudes walking with a phone and things explode into colors, say what?</p>
<p>Anybody that says it was a good ad is probably delusional and BB is up in that guts.  It was bad, didn&rsquo;t chowcase anything nor did it showcase the capabilities of the OS.</p>
<p>I for one think the OS looks like it will be too much going on with the gestures, especially with the q10.</p>
<p>Lost opportunity for BB, dont think BB will be successful.  seems to be a lot of positive hype around the OS but seems it is mostly wishful thinking.  Some of the things people have said about the z10 looks like the backside of the iphone 5 and the OS looks similar to android, i got laughed at about.  Now i se many people saying the same thing.  Nothing innovative with bb10.</p>
<p>Can someone answer me this: why hasn&rsquo;t Blackberry ever offered a landscape slider, OG <span class="caps">DROID</span>-style? Maybe I&rsquo;m the only one in thinking that would have been the perfect form factor to launch BB10.</p>
<p>Personally I think they should have aped the whole OG <span class="caps">DROID</span> campaign. The form factor is a perfect compromise of productivity and play and the marketing campaign emphasized power and capability. I feel they would have been far better off trying to sell that in a Super Bowl ad.</p>
<p>This is the Samsung way of advertising, make a lot of noise about everything except the product itself.  It works for Samsung because people are already familiar with their products and there&rsquo;s always controversy around the ad.  This one is just a mediocre ad and tells you nothing about their new product, something they really should have attempted because the product is quite different from what people are used to.  If people were ignoring <span class="caps">RIM</span>/Blackberry up till now, this ad will not change much.</p>
<p>At least it wasn&rsquo;t like all of the GoDaddy commercials.</p>
<p>Just be thankful for that.</p>
<p>Because the Super Bowl is about substance. Loosen up people.</p>
<p>This was BlackBerry&rsquo;s time to shine, their Super Bowl Moment relevancy.  They failed. My open letter to their <span class="caps">CMO</span>: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/dave-ewart/my-open-letter-to-blackberry-cmo-from-an-admitted-apple-fan/10151416323738544" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/notes/dave-ewart/my-open-letter-to-blackberry-cmo-from-an-admitted-apple-fan/10151416323738544</a></p>
<p>I believe this ad do 2 things very well for the casual user</p>
<p>1. It humorously trivializes the phones shortcomings and it implies that what the phone can actually do is short of miraculous.</p>
<p>The goal here is to peak the casual user curiosity, and encourage him to find more on blackberry&rsquo;s website. If that is the goal I believe it was executed brilliantly.</p>
<p>2. It subliminally introduces the flipped &ldquo;L&rdquo; swipe gesture: 3 second into the ad, and again at the end, we see the music app swapped to reveal the hub. It kind of make the equation BB10= Hub&rsquo;s peek.</p>
<p>It seems to work, since the hub is frequently discussed in this thread. I believe it is because we have all subconsciously registered the peek in the ad, which is critical for BB since that gesture is the most unusual compared to what is currently in the market.</p>
<p>Then I believe it also sends another message to more informed users (..tbc)</p>
<p>To more informed users I believe the ad kind of say &ldquo;what does the features matter anyway?&rdquo;, most reviews say that in terms of feature the Z10 is on par with competition without outshining it.</p>
<p>So the ad is sending the message that BB is not trying to be some kind of super hero tech companies: the Z10 is not the jesus phone and doesn&rsquo;t try to be, it competently does what is expected from it.</p>
<p>BB here is also laughing at itself (am I the only one here to get the jab at sub par mapping here?)</p>
<p>I believe this message is well calibrated given that their main effort would be to first stop the bleeding by convincing current BB users to stay with them and upgrade to BB10 and not iOS</p>
<p>I went out and bought a new BlackBerry Z10 on Friday. If their ad had actually shown all the things you can&rsquo;t do with a Z10 compared to a Nexus 4 or an iPhone the running time for the ad would have been longer than the game.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they stuck with &lsquo;swagger&rsquo; instead of substance.</p>
<p>How come all the phone/tablet ads during the super bowl dont actually show much/if any of the phone at all?</p>
<p>Only a nerd would know the message of the ad, mostly because they previously had heard about it. They would be better off just showing a few close ups of the product and describing its features.</p>
<p>Phones and tablets all basically do the same thing with different spec numbers attached that the average consumer could care less about. People who follow tech news know that 1 tablet is fast/better/sleeker then the next. Everyone else? Not so much. Showing off features would just be cumbersome and uninteresting.</p>
<p>I think this commercial was just fine. Not spectacular not terrible. But fine.</p>
<p>Reading through the comments I think most people are forgetting that the average consumer is not closely following tech news, newest phones and features, conventions etc. Those people, the people here, make up a small percentage of buyers.</p>
<p>Think about the average person, or mom/dad. If they have a smartphone (yes, there are people who do not have smartphones) they are probably going to end up with some crap Android they got sold walking into their carriers store.</p>
<p>What this ad is doing in my mind is simply creating interest and an alternative. A fancy new phone with a short list of things it can&rsquo;t do, I wonder what it can do? Don&rsquo;t forget that people don&rsquo;t need to be spoon fed information in order to make a decision, they have free will and if they thought the ad was somewhat interesting will find out more. I think the ad was interesting enough to do that, especially during the super bowl.</p>
<p>I think in general Blackberry needs to focus on their huge top level ceo and celebrity following. Huge names are loyal to blackberry like beyonce and lady gaga. Why not tap into that?</p>
<p><span class="caps">ALL</span> Of you guys dont get it do you? Samsungs commercial was funny, apples old commercial was good, blackberrys commercial was funny. superbowl is not a time to advertise what the product does but it is supposed to grab peoples attention. blackberry&rsquo;s ad was a good ad for the superbowl! no other electronic company showed what the product does but they showed funny things to promote the company.</p>
<p>I think the fact that is on anyone&rsquo;s list, good or bad, is a good thing for Blackberry. Publicity is publicity.</p>
<p>Wait, wait. There was a Blackberry ad during the super bowl???</p>
<p>&ldquo;shows some swagger&rdquo; &ndash; Frank Boulben</p>
<p>Spoken like a true Chief Marketing Officer</p>
<p>Lol, Haters.  Check #1) <span class="caps">BBRY</span> stock price, #2) prices for the Z10 on ebay US and UK, #3) pre-orders from Canada are breaking records and are 50% from Android/iPhone users, #4) reviews by actual users and not iSheep/Fandroid tech reviewers.</p>
<p>Over $1000 for a blackberry without a keyboard?  This off-market pricing hasn&rsquo;t been seen since iPhone <span class="caps">ONE</span>.  And&hellip;. wait until the Q10 drops&hellip;.haters are going have to suck it. Hard.</p>
<p>For some strange reason I get the feeling RIM is in a good position to launch a come back (than Nokia  and HTC). Never liked their BBs but more players can only be good for the consumer.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re in a better position because they don&#8217;t have as much fat to cut as Nokia though Nokia is just about done trimming and have the two most pivotal quarters coming ahead with their WP8 launch.</p>
<p>I am actually holding a fantastic Nokia smartphone in my hands right now. Blackberry has more fat to cut than Nokia until they actually have a relevant device in consumers&#8217; hands. Nokia has been doing that for more than a year now.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s debatable&#8230;</p>
<p>RIM has around 11,000 employees and Nokia has around 100,000 employees..   Nokia has been cutting fat for longer but there is <strong>ALOT</strong>  more to cut..</p>
<p>People don&#8217;t realize the size of Nokia and how brutal it is to turn it around..</p>
<p>You do know that Nokia is the second largest handset maker in the world right? They&#8217;re huge in revenue and value compared to RIM.</p>
<p>Hum, not so huge with net income though.</p>
<p>Nokia: €-1.164 b<br />
RIM: $556 m</p>
<p>I know which company I&#8217;d rather be right now .</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Canadian and would love for RIM to succeed but their only hope right now is in the emerging markets and regions like Africa&#8230;which, let&#8217;s be brutally honest, are not the areas where disposable income to buy a new phone every year that costs $600 are abundant&#8230;</p>
<p>I would much rather be Nokia, especially with MS backing them up</p>
<p>@lachlan.mcleod Let&#8217;s not forget that half of those employees work for the Nokia Siemens Network which has already been through a restructuring and is finally profitable.</p>
<p>I think RIM is done, which makes me sad. I used to be a pretty big fan. Every few months I see one of my remaining BlackBerry-using friends upgrade to an iPhone and they&#8217;re leaving the platform despite the fact that their most valued feature in a device is the physical qwerty.</p>
<p>I have a fantastive Blackberry phone in my pocket. Bold 9930.    Still the best <em>communication</em> device in the market.    It is not just &#8220;apps&#8221;, it is the core functionality &#8211; keyboard, messaging, build quality, call quality, battery life, robustness.</p>
<p>Look at top 100 paid apps on iPhone &#8211; 95 are games.   I do not play games on the phone (borrow iPod touch from my kids if I feel like it).</p>
<p>Pretty sure such a device can not seriously be called the best communication device in the market&#8230;</p>
<p>all this talk about fat cutting&#8230; get me a donut!</p>
<p>Nah, I doubt it.</p>
<p>Microsoft may be trailing dead last but they have a lot of potential, as well as capital. Windows and Office are still huge market leaders and with their most recent efforts they are creating a unified platform. <del>Metro</del> Modern applications can run on Windows 8, Windows RT, and Windows Phone. That allows a similar app experience between all MS devices and platforms.</p>
<p>Blackberry does not have this going for them, they are simply device makers.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has a installed base of 80 million users, a good proportion of which will be upgrading to BB 10 as soon as it launches.  And BlackBerry gets a monthly service fee from carriers (~$4.50 per user per month) for email and BBM.  This is something no other handset maker gets.  This service fee is why RIM is still generating positive cash flows (as of the latest earnings) and not yet burning cash (unlike Nokia).</p>
<blockquote>a good proportion of which will be upgrading to BB 10 as soon as it launches</blockquote>
<p>And you can provide some source for this, right?  Because as far as I know, BB sells mostly to emerging markets and the lower end of the demographic, which isn&#8217;t exactly the area that goes out and buys shiny new high-margin hardware as soon as it&#8217;s released.</p>
<p>RIM is not apple. RIM sells mostly in emerging markets? nokia does&#8230;.</p>
<p>every mexican got a curve</p>
<p>and everyone in dubai has a bold</p>
<p>everyone in cape town has a torch</p>
<p>Lol!!! Last 3 comments are simply priceless!</p>
<p>c-c-c-combo breaker</p>
<p>Ya, I love latino chicks.</p>
<p>LATINO CHICKS?! = Male TRANSSEXUALS LOL!</p>
<p>I think (hope) you mean latina chicks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry but you are very Very wrong, I&#8217;m a Nigerian, therefore an &#8220;emerging market&#8221; user, BlackBerries are huge over here and people will upgrade once bb10 is released. No other platform offers anything similar to BIS, over here internet still costs an arm and a leg, getting an iOS or Android device is suicide,  3gig of data costs about $10 per month on BIS and $25 on regular networks.</p>
<p>Are you sure those rates will hold once BB10 is out?</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m not sure about specially priced data charges but Windows phone will be offering a service that compresses data being sent through the phone to minimize strain on the network (it may only be in the browser though, not sure) to compete with the advantages that RIM has.</p>
<p>I feel Blackberry s control of the Nigerian market is coming to an end pretty soon. I don&#8217;t think cheap tariff&#8217;s is gonna be the deciding factor in the nearest future. Nigerians are getting bored with the outdated and limited BB OS. Even with the BB10, It&#8217;s still gonna take forever to catch up with app availability on iOS. Lots of people here in Lagos are already switching to much cooler Android devices as data plans get cheaper by the day. Whats the point of cheap data if you can&#8217;t do much with it?</p>
<p>Your market in Nigeria is tiny to the Chinese, American and European markets and your countrymen do not buy a new phone every year like they do here&#8230;unfortunately for RIM&#8230;</p>
<p>RIM also made their money historically from businesses using a BB server&#8230;I don&#8217;t know of any IT groups in my industry where they are seriously thinking of maintaining this route when they can go with an exchange server with the same functionality more and more for free (well they need the exchange server anyway)</p>
<p>&#8220;BB sells mostly to emerging markets and the lower end of the demographic, which isn’t exactly the area that goes out and buys shiny new high-margin hardware as soon as it’s released.&#8221;<br />
I beg to differ sir, if you have any idea about a emerging market and growing middle-class segment, shiny new high-margin hardware is the hot cake and if made available would outsell by miles to many Developed countries just by sheer number.<br />
I do come from a so called &#8220;third=world&#8221;  country which is not even considered a emerging economy, developing economy at best. from my personal experience, people are more then willing to pay $1100+ for a iphone5, about $800-900 for a S3 and similar amount for the high-end phones. A country of 160million people and over 120million cell phone subscriber. even very very small % of those subscriber base can outsell some European markets.</p>
<p>Define &#8220;European markets&#8221;&#8230;are you referring to Denmark or Slovakia&#8230;perhaps those countries because they are tiny</p>
<p>??&#8230; 120 million is a larger population than the UK and France. Plus inIndonesia, the 4th largest country in the world, BB has 52% market share + this time last year there were riots when the Bold 9790.</p>
<p>The IT department at my company sent out an email this past summer saying that they will no longer support BB devices in mid 2013.  They sited the declining use of RIM devices  and the monthly support fees associated with RIM devices.</p>
<p>Everyone I know who had a BB has since upgraded to either IOS or Android devices. So all this talk about companies steadfastly suporting RIM is not necessarily accurate.</p>
<p>More and more companies are encouraging their people to bring their own devices in instead of companies buying them smartphones.</p>
<p>Game, set and match.</p>
<p>Soon, RIM is falling of the rim of the smartphone market for good.</p>
<p>at most of my friends&#8217; companies, they&#8217;ve all been told if they switch to iOS/Android (use the personal phone) and turn in their blackberry, they get between $25-50 reimbursement on their monthly cell phone bills.</p>
<p>BB&#8217;s enterprise days are numbered.</p>
<p>Any proof about that portion that will be upgrading?</p>
<p>Also, with that service fee, what&#8217;s the carriers incentive to push RIM hardware when its less profitable?</p>
<p>here in Canada the minimum BB service is about $15-20,/month, paying RIM $4-5/month still leaves the Carrier good margin with fixed term contract and Data plans are most of the time added on top. it is just extra money for the carriers</p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty expensive. In my Country (Indonesia), you just have to pay $8.5(Three) or $10(Telkomsel) for blackberry plan with unlimited mobile data plan (without tethering). So this what makes Blackberry interesting in my country.</p>
<p>Did we forget that a large percentage of BB users are enterprise clients? We really don&#8217;t have a choice. I have a BB and count as part of that number. Does it mean I like it? Hell no. I hate my BlackBerry and would NEVER have bought it myself. This thing was issued to me. We don&#8217;t get a new BB because the new version came out. We only get a new BB once our refresh cycle has hit. When you list BB subscribers, it includes a lot of people who hate their devices.</p>
<p>In your case it doesn&#8217;t matter if you love or hate your devices. What matters is how well Blackberry devices work as a tool for your companys business, and if it integrates well into your infrastructure.</p>
<p>BB is, and has been, losing users rapidly.  Many companies are dropping it in favor of iPhones and Android and using something like GOOD or built in features.  iOS is very enterprise friendly now as well.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t talking about Microsoft.. I meant Nokia and HTC</p>
<p>Not all Windows 8 apps run on RT, there are some that only run on x86 including all legacy programs. Do Windows 8 apps really run on Windows Phone 8, or do they have to be specifically built for WP8?</p>
<p>Unless Windows 8 becomes very popular, will developers ignore it so they can reach the majority of Windows users?</p>
<blockquote>Do Windows 8 apps really run on Windows Phone 8, or do they have to be specifically built for WP8?</blockquote>
<p>They have to be specifically built for WP8. No Windows 8 app can run on WP8 and vice versa.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read that a port to windows phone isn&#8217;t much work at all, although not being a dev I can&#8217;t speak to how true that is.</p>
<p>Just as a general rule of thumb, no port is ever an easy port. I am a developer. There are lots of things that need to be taken into consideration. Display size being just one of many.</p>
<p>MS has made this a piece of cake&#8230;the only major thing you have to worry about are the API&#8217;s</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the absolute worst thing to have to &#8220;worry about&#8221; when doing a port, though.</p>
<p>MS hasn&#8217;t made this any easier then Apple has for porting between iOS and OSX. Both use the same underlying kernel and basic OS functionality, but the interface and API&#8217;s are all different. Porting is never an easy task, and anybody that tells you that it is is full of shit.</p>
<p>Wtf are you talking about, he said modern applications not just &#8220;applications&#8221; &#8211; modern applications definitely run on all three operating systems. And are you saying that developers would ignore Windows 8, so that they can reach Windows 8 users? DAFUQ??! Ah the internet.</p>
<blockquote>modern applications definitely run on all three operating systems</blockquote>
<p>No, they do not. A Windows Phone modern application will <strong>not</strong><em></em> run on Windows 8 / RT or vice versa.</p>
<p>From what I understand, there is very little effort required to take an RT (Metro)app and publish it to WP8.. Metro Apps run on Windows 8 and RT alike do they not?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure, but that&#8217;s what the developer documentation from MS leads me to believe&#8230;</p>
<p>That was not the statement I was answering too. Anyway,<br />
<blockquote>From what I understand, there is very little effort required to take an RT (Metro)app and publish it to WP8.. </blockquote><br />
I&#8217;m doing this right now and I guess it depends on what you mean by &#8220;little effort&#8221;. What I have to do is to manage basically two separate projects because of the UI and missing stuff in WP8. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t recommend sharing XAML-based UIs between Win8 and WP8. They recommend to share business logic and portable class libs (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj721615(v=vs.105).aspx)" target="_blank">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj721615(v=vs.105).aspx)</a>. So you have to write basically two different UIs for both platforms.</p>
<p>As for Metro apps: most can run on Win 8 (x86) and Win RT (ARM) as long as the developer ships them for both platforms. Some Metro apps appear to work only on x86. I have not looked into it but I guess they are using legacy x86 libraries from 3rd parties which are not available for ARM or something.</p>
<p><em>Pure </em>Metro apps run on both RT and W8. In principle, they&#8217;ll run on WP8 too but you&#8217;ll need create phone specific screens &#8211; as you&#8217;d expect really &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t make sense to squeeze full screen tablet windows onto a phone screen.</p>
<p>There are other gotcha&#8217;s but they&#8217;re relatively minor.</p>
<p>Ah the Internet, indeed.</p>
<p>Apps are a huge advantage in BB&#8217;s favor when compared to microsoft. As much as msft loves to tout that windows 8 and wp8 share parts of the kernel, developers still need to develop wp8 apps from scratch. Their ecosystem is starting low. As much as msft loves touting office support as an advantage in wp8 and rt. Real consumers trying them will see those are nowhere near what they&#8217;d want.</p>
<p>But bb10 has a little card in its sleeve that isn&#8217;t much talked about. It can run Android 2.3.3 apps. It&#8217;s levaraging half a billion apps ahead of microsoft. If you root your bb you can even install the android market on it. This huge. It&#8217;s a genius play by RIM to leverage android apps to boost BB app world. Microsoft should have done something similar, they could have, but chose not to.</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s not the only paramater to whether they&#8217;ll succeed. There are thousands other variables into play. But from where I&#8217;m standing, as an Android developer. I see RIM as having a much better shot than microsoft at securing a safe market share.</p>
<blockquote>developers still need to develop wp8 apps from scratch. </blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/amitdey/archive/2012/11/06/cross-platform-development-windows-8-and-windows-phone-8-c-xaml.aspx" target="_blank">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/amitdey/archive/2012/11/06/cross-platform-development-windows-8-and-windows-phone-8-c-xaml.aspx</a></p>
<p>This example is very lame. What he is showing is that you can put common code (&#8220;business logic&#8221;) in a shared class library and use it from two different projects for WP8 and Win8. At least as long as you are not using API classes or methods which are not available in the other platform&#8230;</p>
<p>Well big deal&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry but sharing libraries for different platforms is possible since 30 years or more. I can write C++ libs which I can share between iOS, Android and BB10 for example.</p>
<p>But the Win8 and WP8 app shown in this example still have completely separate UI code although the XAML code looks similar in this simple case. What developers would like to see is not to have to manage two separate projects for WP8 and Win8 (tablet) but just one project.</p>
<p>Just an example.</p>
<p>Are you saying developers still need to develop wp8 apps from scratch?</p>
<p>I was not the one who claimed that. But actually there is some truth to it depending on how you look at it and which platforms you want to support in the future.</p>
<p>Because if you code your projects how it is shown in the example you posted you have to start the WP8 app basically from scratch. Of course you can reuse some of your business logic from WP7. (You can do that most of the time on many platforms so this is a moot point.)</p>
<p>But if you have started with a WP7 app in the past you could either keep it that way and it will run on WP8. But you cannot do any kind of meaningful cross development with Win8.</p>
<p>Or you can migrate the WP7 project to WP8 (and by doing that lose the WP7 compatibility) . But if your project is not a trivial one as shown in these stupid examples you have to change quite a bit in the code and in the XAML because Microsoft deprecated Silverlight (WP7 was based on Silverlight) and introduced the WinRT app.</p>
<p>So if you want to go the way suggested by your example you might start as well the UIs for Win8 and WP8 cleanly from scratch and drop WP7 compatibility. You can even decide to switch to C++ for games etc. which  was not possible with WP7.</p>
<p>*WinRT API</p>
<p>No one mentioned WP7? I suppose BB7 code can be used on BB10?</p>
<blockquote>Windows Runtime is a technology first introduced in Windows 8 and which offers a core infrastructure, a common type system, and a standard programming model. It’s implemented in C++ and projected into C#, VB, C++, and JavaScript, so it’s easy to consume naturally in the language of your choice. A significant subset of Windows Runtime is built natively into Windows Phone 8, with the functionality exposed to all supported languages. This gives you the ability to use the same API for common tasks such as networking, working with sensors, processing location data, and implementing in-app purchase. By using common Windows Runtime API in your app, you increase the potential to share code between your Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store apps to save time and improve the maintainability of your apps over time. The following table lists the Windows Runtime APIs that are common to both platforms.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj681690(v=vs.105).aspx">and more&#8230;</a></blockquote>
<p>I suppose the above is just make believe?</p>
<p>What is your point?</p>
<p>Do you have read this piece before you copied it?</p>
<blockquote>A significant <strong>subset</strong> of Windows Runtime is built natively into Windows Phone 8 [&#8230;]</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Windows Runtime&#8221; is the WinRT API I talked about and &#8220;subset&#8221; means that the WinRT API on Win8 and WP8 are not 100% identical. This is of course the reason you cannot use the same project for both. This is also the reason the example you posted uses two projects and not one (!). I&#8217;m doing Win8 and WP8 development right now and targeting both WP8 and Win8 has to be done as described above.</p>
<p>So again what is your point?</p>
<p>As for BB7: yes you can reuse Java business logic for the BB10s Android Java API in the same way you can reuse business logic between WP7 and WP8 and Win8 and WP8 etc.. Again this is a moot point.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t care. I have never done BB development. (Maybe I will do it. Looking into BB10 right now because actually you can reuse a lot of code for it like Qt code. But I degress&#8230;)</p>
<p>Anway I was just saying that your example you posted did not prove that you don&#8217;t have to start from scratch.</p>
<p>why in the hell would anyone bother to buy a BB10 device if they can just get a way better android device to run android apps (if thats such a huge factor in success for BB10 as you claim).</p>
<p>you also fail to mention that a lot of android apps (near 50% of all) didn&#8217;t actually work in android player on OS 2.0 and i doubt its much better in BB10.</p>
<p>plus, if you &#8216;root your bb and install android market on it&#8217;, how is RIM getting any money from this at all? didn&#8217;t you read this article? making money solely by selling hardware is a bust.</p>
<p>horrible arguments from what i assume to be another delusional crackberry poster.</p>
<p>APK (android) to BAR (playbook + possibly BB10) converter: apk2bar.unker.net/</p>
<p>Wrong, Modern apps run on Windows 8 &amp; Windows RT only. Even then for some reason some are only x86. Windows Phone apps will not run on Windows 8/RT. So if you&#8217;re a developer you have to write 2 separate applications.</p>
<p>on the desktop /work PC.</p>
<p>completely useless in the mobile market, and they are altenatives to office some even keep their format of documents better than microsoft own office mobile solutions like kingoffice, polaris or quickoffice.</p>
<p>theyre in a good position because they know who their target market is and they know how to cater perfectly to their target market. And, being a college student, i know there are ALOT of young adults that only use their phones for facebook, twitter, texting, bbm etc. ios and android just arent as centred on this as BLackberry. As for Nokia i dont think they even know who their target market is&#8230; (fat heavy phone with a good camera? come on&#8230;)</p>
<p>they actually have NO idea who their target market is. their target market was business, which failed. then they tried to target consumers with the playbook. that failed. so who are they trying to target now exactly?</p>
<p>android and iOS arent as centered on facebook/twitter/texting as bb? are you stupid? blackberry doesnt even have equivalent quality apps for any of these services.</p>
<p>How stupid are you? How do you measure &#8216;quality&#8217; on messaging apps? The graphics design or what? BB is still superior in communicating, no need to argue about this. All these apps are better integrated in BB and the device is faster and easier to use, especially with the hardware keyboard. I can simply have a chat with 10 people at the same time over different channels and nobody would ever experience a delay. So piss the hell off with your glossy touchie bling bling lame devices.</p>
<p>Well it appears the BB users are indeed quite delusional.</p>
<p>More players isn&#8217;t <em>always</em> good for the consumer. It depends entirely on the type of market.</p>
<p>More browsers with more rendering engines would never be good for the consumer, for example. It would be too large a task for all developers to test against everything, and the overwhelming choice would lead most users to rely on the established opinions of others rather than explore the options themselves.</p>
<p>More smartphone platforms means more and more apps need to be duplicated across different frameworks, taking up developer time and hurting the quality and progress of other versions, or requiring more hands and driving up costs for a payout that may not come.</p>
<p>Saturation has a negative connotation for a very real reason. I&#8217;m sure most pro-competition people would agree that an overloaded market isn&#8217;t a good thing, but it&#8217;s hard to tell when people use absolutes, like &#8220;can only be good&#8221;.</p>
<p>To be clear, I&#8217;m not opposed to competition&#8212;where it really can have a positive effect. I&#8217;m opposed to losing touch with the nuances of the market.</p>
<p>Its using a webkit base engine for its browsers. Same base engine as chrome and safari</p>
<p>this is hardware market.</p>
<p>it will lead to cheaper hardware regarless.</p>
<p>look at nokia how bad their sales are their hardware is being giving away for free.</p>
<p>Yep, they&#8217;re screwed</p>
<p>Lol. Nice one.</p>
<p>Lol. They&#8217;re screwed</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t see what RIM can do to push back on Android, iOS, AND Windows Phone&#8230;. I just can&#8217;t see what they can do&#8230; they are starting from scratch in 4th place.</p>
<p>When did Microsoft pass RIM? Maybe WP8 will give MS the push they need, but they are the ones, not RIM, in 4th place in the US market right now.</p>
<p>Although you&#8217;re right that RIM as a whole is ahead of Microsoft, BB10 itself is an entirely new platform and ecosystem.  If you look at it that way, they are starting from a zero install base, putting them behind WP7/WP8.</p>
<p>BB10 includes all current playbook apps + android ports, so BB10 is not starting from the ground up like wp did.</p>
<p>You also neglect all the current BlackBerry subscribers who have been waiting since 2010 for this new platform,  some of those who have moved to other platforms are also keeping an eye on Blackberry 1 0 too.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has a cult following much larger than any generated by Windows Phone</p>
<p>How are they on forth when they have more market share then Nokia and Microsoft, there already 3rd, still making money and have no debt.</p>
<p>Like states above a good portion of there 80 million + are potential bb10 users, and me as an iPhone user will own a bb10 device from start. Even if 40% of that 80 million by bb10 devices in the first 2 quarters that&#8217;s 30 million in sales, not including new buyers of there phone(like me). Rim was once the top smartphone maker for a reason(not saying they will be again) and if this focus can be a strange third player, Microsoft has been struggling in the mobile sector for close to 10 years, and if wp7 didn&#8217;t do good, why would wp8, they both look exactly the same. There are corporations leaving blackberry because there current devices are old, but at the same time once there new phones out in2 month this could all change and quickly.</p>
<p>Rim is in a better spot them Nokia and Microsoft, MS has had money for years and as always failed when it came to a mobile experience. Rim has a lot of backing beyond there bank, the top 5 banks in Canada all have big shares in rim and also contracts with them and won&#8217;t let me fail, blackberry os 7 is still a top selling phones in many country&#8217;s outside the US, in South Africa there are more blackberry devices sold then android and iOS combined. There &#8220;blackberry balance&#8221; will be a big thing to separate them from the competition in the business sector.</p>
<p>The truth is you have no idea that 40% of current owners will upgrade to BB10. When I worked for at&amp;t in retail you wouldn&#8217;t believe how many former Blackberry owners switched over to another platform simply because they HATED their phone, especially the Torch. Only the most diehard keyboard lover chose to stick with it. It&#8217;s personal experience but I saw it happen so much over the course of a year that I feel it&#8217;s not insignificant.</p>
<p>How many people will still have the bitter taste of Blackberry in their mouth when they hear about the &#8217;new BlackBerry? Even WP dealt with this and look at what a drastic change it was from the previous WM.</p>
<p>What incentive do carriers have to sell it when there&#8217;s accompanying service costs?</p>
<p>those peopel that stick to their keyboards are more than wp7 sales</p>
<p>Well, releasing a new phone with a solid OS would be a start&#8230;</p>
<p>If they execute well on this it could turn them around, if the numbers above are correct they&#8217;re at least revenue positive even now. The handset market isn&#8217;t a zero sum game, I think there is room for four or more companies to exist and make money, even if they aren&#8217;t all as financially successful as Apple has been.</p>

<p>Just focus on the productivity aspects. Forget about building media ecosystems if all the company can muster are partnerships with no-name players like Rovi and 7Digital.</p>

<blockquote>&#8216;we have this one shot with BlackBerry 10&#8217;</blockquote>
<p>And you missed it by 2 years.</p>
<p>TH is CEO since one year.</p>
<p>We indicates the company, the company should have had a modern OS on it&#8217;s phones 2 years ago.</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter if they did 2 years ago or not, what matters today is that they now have one being released, and its never to late to bring a new os or technology. iOS is now 5 years old with minimum changes happening every year.(I use iOS currently, will use bb10 in feb.)</p>
<p>Never say never.</p>
<p>So they are saying they are targeting the productivity market, yet their first effort is going to be a smartphone. Okay, so tell me what a BB smartphone on BB10 is going to be able to do as far as productivity is concerned. Word Processing? Spreadsheets? Powerpoints?</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t see how they are going to <del>compete</del> win consumers at all. Everyone that doesn&#8217;t have a BB is going to say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s neat, but I can do that on here too.&#8221; They would have to create some impressive hardware and I don&#8217;t see that happening. Maybe they can win back the folks who like physical keyboards?</p>
<p>Is Office really the only definition of productivity? Heavy email, texting, and phone calls count as productivity for quite a few people who may produce very few documents.</p>
<p>+1 &#8230;. And rims phones still are the best when it comes to email</p>
<p>Really? How so?</p>
<p>No, not really. When looking into enterprise email, it is usually powered by Exchange, GApps, or mayby lotus. However, Exchange and Google Apps (Gmail) both use Active Sync to manage mobile email such as push. And guess what, Active Sync is owned by Microsoft. And who knows better to manage email/active sync than the company created it?</p>
<p>RIM? Apple? My Grandma?</p>
<p>Active Sync sucks sorry to break it to you.</p>
<p>That, I can&#8217;t agree with.  RIM doesn&#8217;t have the monopoly on qwerty devices.</p>
<p>I do word processing and spreadsheets on my iPhone. It works out pretty well. I can type crazy fast on the iPhone and tend to have it with me all the time so I can get 10-15m of work done here and there. Numbers on iOS is nice with the contextual keyboard. I use it to mostly update existing spreadsheets with new values. So in theory yes productivity on a SmartPhone can be done but iOS already does it really well.</p>
<p>RIM problem used to be to keep their clients from leaving towards iOS. They are so late, that the clients already left and now they have to win them back, which is even harder.</p>
<p>They have 80 million + users currently and still growing, they may have lost a lot to other os&#8217;s but there doing as bad as the media makes it out to be, you&#8217;d be surprised to see how many android and iOS users are considering bb10 devices it may not be a crazy amount but there are a lot of people.(including me a iOS user), I stopped by crack berry.com and could believe the amount of comments from android and iOS users considering the switch, that shows there are people willing to go back.</p>
<p>RIM is in da house.</p>
<p>You have a good point.  There are a lot of people out there who don&#8217;t want to buy into Apple&#8217;s expensive ecosystem, don&#8217;t trust Android&#8217;s dodgy ecosystem (and reputation for fragmentation), aren&#8217;t quite keen on Windows Phone devices &#8211; possibly because they look so different &#8211; and don&#8217;t quite have anywhere to go.  Perhaps Blackberry is in the market for lost souls.</p>
<p>Why did my eyes glaze over during his ten second pitch?</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not releasing BB10 before Q4 because that&#8217;s when <em>everyone</em> releases their phones&#8221;</p>
<p>which is <strong>possibly</strong> because the holiday season is when the majority of phone sales are being made. just a wild guess there.</p>
<p>So do you release a phone when there is more competition or less. That is the question here.</p>
<p>if it&#8217;s a good phone / good OS it should be able to sell even if there&#8217;s competition.</p>
<p>if &#8220;waiting until there&#8217;s less spotlight on the competition&#8221; is what you base your strategy on, i think that&#8217;s a bad idea.</p>
<p>You obviously missed the part where he said the carriers said they could/would focus they&#8217;re attention on BB. He chose focus on his product over a crap shoot holiday blitz filled with other options. You&#8217;d have to spend MORE money during the holiday season just to be on the same level as the other players in advertising alone. I worked at sprint I&#8217;ve talked to the blackberry reps at least here in the US carrier relationships can make or break a phone/device. A lot of you act like we the United States are the only relevant market in the world. I Have a Evo LTE and a BB Bold 9900 I keep as a backup. I can tell you with certainty that no device comes close to handling email as well as a BB. Their servers are second to none in that department. No email on any other device comes faster or more reliable. My gmail comes faster on my BB than it does my Android. Yes during my time at sprint I saw a lot of people convert from BB to ios or android because they didn&#8217;t like their phone. But I also saw people convert because they read or saw some media hype saying that BB is going out of business. I can&#8217;t tell you how many people came in asking for an iPhone 4 4s not knowing the Bold existed. When presented with the bold even knowing the app advantages and better camera and media capabilities of the iPhone those BB users STILL choose the Bold. It had enough improvements over their current phone but kept everything they loved about their BB. Also in my experience no phone works better as an international device than a blackberry it just works.</p>
<p>Although, strangely enough it seems to be working for Microsoft.  I noticed a significant downswing in the awe around iOS and Android as WP8 was approaching.  It&#8217;s true that you can&#8217;t outwait the competition, but there is an ebb and flow that you can work to.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;less&#8221;, because by the time the holiday&#8217;s over everyone&#8217;s got a new phone already. That&#8217;s why Nokia x MS announced the Lumia&#8217;s earlier  with the iPhone 5 even if it meant waiting 2 months. Knowing this phone is coming out later will reduce people getting iPhone 5&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Yeah, when everyone else&#8217;s phones are being promoted. Not so good to see BB is it?</p>
<p>Your comments dumb you need to rethink your situation, why release a phone when everyone else is and not get any media or shine, they picked the perfect time.</p>
<p>So their strategy is that they can&#8217;t compete?</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t compete with established players that are all releasing new products at this time. Instead they are going to wait until these new products have had a chance to age then release a product and have the limelight entirely to themselves.</p>
<p>Right now all the articles would read, iPhone 5, Nexus 4, Lumia 920, oh and something from BB. What they want is to wait until it&#8217;s just: BB, BB, BB, BB. Makes sense to me.</p>
<p>The issue with this logic is it assumes anyone can buy a BB whenever they wish.</p>
<p>people love upgrading when their contract ends. The majority of sales are in Fall, Xmas time period. Those who are locked couldn&#8217;t care that BB&#8217;s platform is launching 2013. After they buy new phones this Xmas, they will be locked in for two more years.   RIM HAS to advertise more now just to hope at ppl will wait till January to buy the next BB.</p>
<p>The waiting strategy really only works if customers are free to buy at any point in time. By every day not having a prime product  in market while OS is done/fully baked you are losing potential customers for a two year duration.</p>
<p>If news of a BB release gets buried under news about iPhone, Nexus, and WP8, then no one is going to know they can upgrade their Blackberries. RIM has to make a huge splash when the release BB10, they need mainstream media to report on it, they need everyone to know that they are still a viable platform. That is what this strategy is about. So as peoples contracts expire they are aware that BB has something new for them ready to go.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with not releasing for the holidays is Windows Phone 8, RIM can&#8217;t afford to lose any more ground to Microsoft.</p>
<p>I hate this bullshit. People act like idiots when they say things that sound like &#8216;phones are sold only during the holiday season.&#8217;. Fuck it, phones are sold the whole year over, because contracts aren&#8217;t expiring in the holidays only. Prepaid phones are sold in the holiday season, yes. FUCK the holiday season and everyone who acts like its the only fucking time in the year you can sell damn phones.</p>
<p>You can protest all you want but there are retail cycles which affect sales both in corporate and consumer markets.  Releasing after the holiday push will affect RIM sales and not in a positive way.  There is a reason why sales are less in the early part of the year across the board.</p>
<p>OK, but what about the low-spending time just after the New Year starts &#8211; January/February is known for it&#8217;s weak time.  Just after that comes the run-up to the financial year end (well it does here in the UK) at the end of March and nobody wants to spend at that point &#8211; mostly because budgets are already used up.</p>
<p>Add that to the massive increase in the BYOD world, and yes, massive sales seasons like the December holiday season make a huge difference.  If you&#8217;ve been bought a new device as a present and you can use it for work as well, you&#8217;re going to&#8230;and the company will be happy to not spend any money getting you a new Blackberry.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s German. I always assumed he was Canadian. Sadly, that&#8217;s the only thing I took from what he had to say.</p>
<blockquote>I DON&#8217;T GO AGAINST COMPETITION, I GO FOR CUSTOMERS. I GO FOR BUSINESS</blockquote>
<p>not sure what that means but lack of looking at the competition is what got you in this mess.</p>
<p>Not his fault.</p>
<p>I must say, you and those 8 people who liked that comment have to be dumbasses. Of course he&#8217;s looking at the competition, he&#8217;s just saying that cuz&#8217; its business.</p>
<p>They watch competition, but are focused on more then just that.</p>
<p>Apple has this mentality too, look at their bankroll, I say good for them. You don&#8217;t always have to sell low value junk just because the other guy started doing it.</p>
<p>Nice interview, Dieter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again, but I am one of the few that thinks  RIM has a chance. I recently got a Curve from work, and after using consumer-centric smartphones for the last 4 years, I was thoroughly impressed with the usefulness of the device, and not to mention its hardware design was kind of pretty too. I definitely think something was lost when iOS and Android were released, which had this huge focus on consumer/media experience. Going back to the  curve felt like a truly functional mobile machine, where everything i needed was right in front of me. BB10 seems to be a huge departure from their older OSs that might just try to mimic  the current touch OS&#8217;s, but if they can truly translate the functionality and classy hardware from their heyday into a modern touch phone,  I think it could be a success.</p>
<p>Interesting comment and perspective. That&#8217;s a sentiment you don&#8217;t hear often and I wonder how many people feel that way</p>
<p>I do, and I&#8217;ll switch from my iPhone 5 to a bb10 device</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve been saying that all comment thread, we know.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Can you give a more specific example? What is not right in front of you on any other platform? You&#8217;re usually one, <strong>maybe</strong>, two taps away from everything.</p>
<p>2 Assumptions.</p>
<p>1. You never owned a BlackBerry OR<br />
2. You didn&#8217;t know how to use it right when you had one</p>
<p>People can&#8217;t imagine and doesn&#8217;t get this point. A QWERTY BlackBerry is faster and more convenient in every way to perform tasks, especially communicating. To give an example. Search for definition article on wikipedia, copy a chapter of it, paste it in any messaging application and send it. You CAN do that on iOS and Android as well, but it takes much longer. Therefore you don&#8217;t do it, because it&#8217;s that inconvenient. People on BlackBerrys react on conversations much faster. Wether its mail, text or anything else. Guess why.</p>
<p>The door has not closed on RIM. Microsoft has left it wide open with the &#8220;toy&#8221; WP8 offering.</p>
<p>OOOHH NICE CHEAP SHOT!</p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 is awesome. It is less of a toy than the incumbent corporate smartphone platform &#8211; iOS. Want to make a friendly wager that you will be eating those words? RIM is done</p>
<p>Funny since yours was just as cheap. ;-)</p>
<p>Rim still holds more market share then Microsoft and Nokia, no to mention Microsoft has struggled and fail in the mobile industry for close to 10 years, wp8 is still just like wp7 and that didn&#8217;t do good at all, so I don&#8217;t expect wp8 to be that much better.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also making money off of most android&#8217;s sold, they have another option in just needing to outlast RIM. Face it, RIM is fighting an uphill battle as far as overall apps, marketing dollars, mindshare and OS development.</p>
<p>Microsoft has many, many other business units to fall back on.  Even Nokia has several business units, NSN is pulling profits in an underperforming industry and their mobile phone unit is still doing solid work, and they copped a 1 billion dollar a year lifeline from MS to help shore up their smartphone unit.</p>
<p>RIM on the other hand has all their eggs in a single basket that is under siege on all sides.  This isn&#8217;t like Nokia, where even though they didn&#8217;t score a hit with their first generation WP7 devices they had enough going on to still have another shot with WP8.  If RIM fumbles BB10 they&#8217;re toast.</p>
<p>Well, Microsoft are actually advertising WP8 now, and making a massive go at the market, and receiving favourable reviews across the board (except for the OBVIOUS so-anti-anything-Microsoft sites).  I&#8217;ve also noticed more and more people saying how they&#8217;re now interested in getting a Windows phone.</p>
<p>Also, WP8 may look like WP7, but anyone who has used it for even a short while quickly realises that it is quite a significant improvement, and it actually DOES have a lot more coming to it than WP7 ever had.</p>
<p>FYI. There is a market for corporate (so called) &#8220;smartphones&#8221;. IOS? Hardly. However, there is no denying that the cache of an Apple device gives the suits something&#8230;(a phone and their email).  BYOD is Microsoft&#8217;s strategy?</p>
<p>What is the wager?</p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p>Where do they keep finding these CEOs?</p>
<p>Usually on a Forbes &#8216;Rich List&#8217;.  Heartbreaking, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>&#8220;shooting for the starts&#8221; &#8211; should be stars.</p>
<p>Interesting interview. Looks like RIM has to start doing something other than phones.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been doing things other then phones, QNX is already used in majority of the cars out there today, and it hospitals. Rim owns QNX witch is what bb10 is built from, a kernel that&#8217;s been around for 20+ years, and is military approved as being the most secure.</p>
<p>shhhh&#8230;no blog told them this so it doesnt exist</p>
<p>The train has left the station and they haven&#8217;t even started chasing it down. This next train better be the fastest thing on the track or else you may as well go home.</p>
<p>Sorry RIM. You are no more.</p>
<p>Watch them just come back and completely dominate the market. You never know!</p>
<p>Even better would be if they just somehow managed to stay alive and just always beat Microsoft, no matter what new Windows Phones came out!  Imagine the fury as the two &#8220;old companies&#8221; get slammed the Christ down into 3 percent and 2 percent respectively!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always going to be a lunatic fringe who go with a non Android or Apple device, and it would just be a big pressure cooker of crazy! :-)</p>
<p>I wish but it&#8217;s common sense that since google took the Microsoft/Windows&#8217;s route with android they wi always hold top market share, but they could be a strong third and big competition for iOS if they don&#8217;t step it up, I bought an iPhone 5 but will buy a bb10 devices on launch, due to it being released with more features then iOS.</p>
<p>Like what?</p>
<p>IMHO, Blackberry has one (and only one) chance to make a comeback&#8230; and it will ALL depend on the strength of BB10&#8217;s web browser. It&#8217;s like this: if your platform doesn&#8217;t have apps, the only other way to get things done is with the browser. Therefore, if the browser is weak at performing app-like tasks, your platform will fail. For example, I enjoy using the Redbox app to reserve movies on my Android devices, but what if I didn&#8217;t have the app? I would have to use my phone&#8217;s browser to navigate the Redbox website. On Android, this is a tolerable, but not great experience for a number of reasons. Windows Phone is even worse, by the way. If the new Blackberry is going to earn my dollars, it&#8217;s going to have the BEST web browsing experience ever seen on a mobile device. Case in point: if the browser fails to reflow text upon zooming, I&#8217;m not even going to consider BB10.</p>
<p>That is the truth. BB&#8217;s web browser needs to set the standard for html 5 and speed. As an enterprise user, I just want security + immediate email + an amazing web browsing speed. Why is it so fricking hard.</p>
<p>Try iOS or Android.</p>
<p>There browser on bb10 already beat out every other mobile os when it was tested, it had the best benchmarks. Google it</p>
<p>Well would you lookie here &#8211; <a href="http://html5test.com/results/tablet.html" target="_blank">http://html5test.com/results/tablet.html</a><br />

<p>that&#8217;s what the recommend button is for.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case then the battle is won.</p>

<p>Dieter uses the term &#8220;table stakes&#8221; <em>a lot</em>.  And I&#8217;m not sure that he&#8217;s even using it right.</p>
<p>So fantastic!  You could make a million quotes from this interview.</p>
<p>I loved the very start, when Dieter basically tells Thorsten &#8220;so you guys are late as hell, and yet your latest promise is that you&#8217;ll get there some time next year&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>His response?  A cold &#8220;Co-rrect, that is the announcement.&#8221;!  HA!</p>

<p> It reminded me of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Hard_with_a_Vengeance">Die Hard villain brothers (1 and 3)</a> in that cold, efficient German &#8220;evil businessman manner&#8221;, but also The Simpsons in Australia, that toilet!</p>

<p><img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luh66zKpii1qa6rsvo1_r2_400.gif" /></p>
<p>He asked Thorsten if the phones will be out on Jan 30th, and Thorsten said Yes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Co-rect, that is the announcement.&#8221; says cold robo-CEO :-)</p>
<p>&#8220;Every-thing is going according to scheduled plans, do-not be alarmed.  We have foreseen market issues, and they have been accounted for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Dr Gero in DragonBall Z, but even the cyborg scientist lost his temper!</p>
<p>This guys the anti-Ballmer!  Can you imagine Thorsten giving an impromptu Steve Jobs &quot;we think that approach sucks, and I said to myself, you know, we can do BETTER than that, BETTER than a really crappy deal, do BETTER than a &#8220;bag of hurt&#8221;, to instead offer our customers an insanely great new product, which we think you&#8217;re gonna love&quot;. ?</p>
<p>Not gonna happen.  The man is ice cold!<br />
:-)</p>
<p>Could anyone here clarify how the whole Android apps on BB10 thing work? Can I make any of my apps work on BB as long as I send it to their store for review? And as a user can I run just any .apk that I download directly on my BB?</p>
<p>If these are true, that&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll talk about the situation now on the Playbook. In the BB/PB appworld, some of the apps are already Android apps repackaged to run on the Playbook. There is an Android player on the PB &#8211; it&#8217;s mostly transparent for the user&#8230; you launch the app and it works&#8230; you have to learn one gesture to simulate using the &#8220;back&#8221; button.  Most users won&#8217;t even know it&#8217;s running in an Android runtime, depending on UI menu setup in the app.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a dev, well.. you wouldn&#8217;t ask those questions so of course devs can either repackage their apps I guess, or port them or rewrite them for the PB.</p>
<p>You cannot run some .apk like that. You can find .bar files to sideload to your PB using the DDPB installer tool&#8230; it requires no rooting and the tool runs in Windows &#8211; you just need to set your PB to dev mode and note the addess and password and use that in DDPB, point to .bar(s) you want to load, and install. It works.</p>
<p>You may also try to repackage yourself some .apk to .bar like shown for instance here ( <a href="http://crackberry.com/how-sign-convert-and-install-android-files-your-blackberry-playbook-using-windows-or-mac" target="_blank">http://crackberry.com/how-sign-convert-and-install-android-files-your-blackberry-playbook-using-windows-or-mac</a> ) but it&#8217;s trial and error. Not all Android apps can just be repackaged to .bar on the fly&#8230; some won&#8217;t work at all, some will with missing or crash triggering features&#8230; Of course, using .apk or .bar and sideloading entails some risks in terms of security, etc.</p>
<p>+1 &#8230;</p>
<p>It is not that difficult. Just start here:<br />
<a href="http://developer.blackberry.com/android/" target="_blank">http://developer.blackberry.com/android/</a></p>
<p>Will do it myself. I don&#8217;t know whether BB10 will take off but I&#8217;m sure percentagewise more BB owners are willing to pay for apps than Android owners. ;-)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very true, in fact dispute the amount of android phones sold, blackberry is still the 2nd most profitable os behind iOS.</p>
<p>Right, when you said &#8220;my apps&#8221; I thought you meant my Android apps on my current device, but tw&#8217;s post made me think that maybe you meant the apps you developed. And I didn&#8217;t want to sound condescending or anything with my remarks on you obviously not being a dev etc. I&#8217;m no developer myself so no offense. Anyways good luck!</p>
<p>&#8220;The profit pool in tablets is rather small&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s right if he&#8217;s looking at anyone except Apple which has sold over 100 million iPads at very good margins.</p>
<p>Apple has sucked all the oxygen out of the mobile market.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s right though. Amazon basically reused the RIM Playbook&#8217;s design and sold it at half the price with somewhat similar hardware. Google is selling another tablet at cost. There really isn&#8217;t much money to be made in the 7&quot; tablet market because of Amazon and Google, and 10&quot; tablet market is likewise barren in money.</p>
<p>really interesting huh?  I mean, its freaking INCREDIBLE, in that theres precisely ONE successful tablet, and then theres the Nexus 7 which is presumably always close to sold out because its sold at goddam COST!  No profit being made.  This race is three years in, four generations of the ONLY tablet worth a goddamn damn&#8230;&#8230;and the only companies to even TRY competing volunteer from the very start to slit their own throats in an instant race to the very bottom!</p>
<p>Bizarre!</p>
<p>We went from the freaking &#8220;Xoom&#8221; which was about 800 bucks USD  trying to compete against a $499 established iPad&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.and ever since, every full size tablet has been off a cliff, suicidal.  Its like they never even tried making a roughly equivalent $499 tablet, or a somewhat better $550 tablet, or even a $450 or $400 tablet!  Too expensive while STILL probably losing money&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.to razor thin profits, sold essentially at cost!</p>
<p>Now, if the Non iPads try and raise their prices&#8230;.&#8220;HEY!  The Nexus 7b is more expensive than the original!  What a rip!&#8221; !</p>
<p>Crazy world!</p>
<p>Aside from your other ramblings, there is simply no data to back up that the Nexus 7 is sold &#8220;at cost&#8221;. Google doesn&#8217;t make any money off of it, but that is more than likely a deal with ASUS, not because there is no profit to be made off of it. The &#8220;part cost&#8221; of the device is very close to the actual cost of the device, but it&#8217;s kind of silly to think ASUS isn&#8217;t getting bulk deals and extremely competitive pricing.</p>
<p>I thought this was actually pretty good, about as good as it could be for RIM.</p>
<p>1. Heins communicates that he understands the importance of the moment, of this BB 10 launch- it&#8217;s their last shot (calling it &#8216;one shot&#8217; just makes it less desperate sounding.) This is fortunately a 180 from Laziridis and his inscrutable comments about having a &#8216;front row seat&#8217; (I guess of all the competition passing them by.)</p>
<p>2. I think he fell down in the 10-second pitch part. He mentioned a bunch of stuff that was so-so, and only later presented what I thought could be a compelling and differentiating selling point- BB 10 is what will help you take all your different channels (Facebook, email, twitter, etc.) and combine/ distill them into 1 channel for you.</p>
<p>In a word, their pitch should be &#8216;Focus&#8217;. They can&#8217;t compete with iOS and Android on app store size, but they can present a compelling alternative message, and I think this is it. As the interviewer said, Windows has Live Tiles which is their &#8216;thing&#8217; (and somewhat different than BB&#8217;s message), this can be the message for Blackberry (which also fits into their traditional image of mobile productivity.) It doesn&#8217;t turn app store size into a strength, but it reframes the discussion and can give them a shot until more apps come. There are users out there who don&#8217;t care about absolute app store size, app store size is a means to an end (overall usability and versatility), not the end in itself.</p>
<p>I say all this however, without actually having seen anything of BB 10. I think that should be their marketing message, I don&#8217;t know how it will hold up technically. In theory combining our different channels in order to simplify them is great, in practice it can often make things more complicated.</p>
<p>They have to be absolutely ruthless in their dedication to their own focus, to what BB 10 is. If they devolve into a kitchen sink strategy of trying to cram everything iOS and Android have accomplished in multiple iterations into their essentially 1.0 product, they will be written off as a years late me-too product. Don&#8217;t make it an Everything Phone, make it a truly SMART Phone..</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe I just talked myself into thinking they have a shot at this&#8230;</p>
<p>Their current and previous BB commercials had this sort of direction, but weren&#8217;t nearly concrete enough to show how a BB enables you to be productive in ways other phones can&#8217;t- probably because there really wasn&#8217;t any differentiating factors in their aged OS.</p>
<p>They really have to show the goods with BB 10 if they are going to pull this off. I have seen some screenshots and read the previews so I&#8217;m not totally blind on BB 10, but I&#8217;m still undecided on whether it will truly deliver.</p>
<p>They do have a shot and I agree with your comment, as an iOS user who was on android before, I will by a bb10 devices.( and its not just cause I&#8217;m Canadian, eh lol jp)</p>
<p>Remember the speed of sound: you can&#8217;t hear the bullet meant for you. Please, &#8220;do the Dell&#8221; &#8211; shut up shop and hand the money to your shareholders.</p>
<p>And now, the news.</p>
<p>This is the first realistic thing Thorsten Heins has said since he became CEO of RIM.</p>
<p>I have used Android since I can&#8217;t remember the name of the version using a UK tmobile pulse.<br />
It was a plasticky I think ztc made handset and android was a wild wasteland so ruff around the edges I was scared to download an app for fear of bricking my phone.<br />
Forward to 2012 and Im now sat with a gnote running ics and with the exception on touchwiz it runs like an army tank on skis.<br />
Android has really come a long way but&#8230;.. This fragmentation is now really turning me off the platform.<br />
Yes I know I could sort most of my woes out by purchasing a Nexus 4 but to be honest I think I&#8217;m just really bored of  android and the lack of quality in the apps when compared to ios is just not acceptable to me anymore .<br />
So what are my options, iOS without a doubt has my money when it comes to tablets, end of. But whe talking about the iPhone I feel the argument for so much restriction and screen size to useful innovative apps is lost on me.<br />
Windows phone 8 is Microsoft entering the arena and I will need more time to have a full opinion on ms stratergy and innovations.<br />
So now I look at Blackberrys proposition for the first time. They are the underdogs (which I like) they have everything to loose or gain.<br />
I want my phone to keep me connected and give me the tools to articulate myself quickly and efficiantly, games, movies and browsing can be done on my tablet comfortably and  allow my phone to be a phone first and a part time media device second, I believe Blackberry 10 is that and I will be supporting RIM with a purchase at launch with a preference toward the qwerty keyboard model but also being impressed by what I have seen so far from the fully touchscreen model.</p>
<p>Thats how I feel about android to, it lead to me buying a iPhone 5, and since I had an iPad already it&#8217;s not to different, I think bb10 is gonna be a bigger success then people think, it will have features both android and iOS don&#8217;t, and will be released with more then the iPhone. I&#8217;ll also support rim/bb10 from launch.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about the greater marketplace, but they have a chance of succeeding with <em>me</em> if they do two things:</p>
<p>1.  Just do a wholesale copy of the webOS UI/UX.  They started on this path with the Playbook, and at the time I yelled &#8220;Ripoff!&#8221; (being a webOS loyalist).  But since it&#8217;s clear that nobody is going to make an actual webOS phone, I just want <em>somebody</em> to come out with the closest thing possible to that experience.  Strangely, the Playbook OS is still ahead of Mattias Duarte&#8217;s latest Android improvements in this respect.</p>
<p>2.  Make an affordable unlocked device.  If Google remains the only player committed to this segment of the market, then the Nexus 4 will get my money come January.</p>
<p>I love the webOS UI but BB10 is very nice in its own way. I think the BlackBerry hub is actually a better way to do notifications. The only thing missing from the BB10 experience is universal search. That and cards&#8230; cards are so damn good, why isn&#8217;t anybody copying them?!</p>
<p>BB10 is impressing me enough where the QWERTY BB10 phone is increasingly looking like the phone I will replace my Pre2 with.</p>
<p>Also, I don&#8217;t think there could be a better guy at RIM&#8217;s helm right now. Thorsten seems like he really knows what he&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>I totally agree. I had a Pre 2 before a string of higher-specced Android devices, and missed joyful multitasking and Synergy so much that I &#8220;downgraded&#8221; to a Pre 3. I can&#8217;t get the latest Angry Birds releases, or &#8211; shiver &#8211; Instagram, but my productivity and sense of gratifying connectedness has increased. If HP won&#8217;t build the smartphone I desire, BB10 may well deliver the goods. I bought my dad a Playbook and was impressed with QNX and RIM&#8217;s interface for it, and I&#8217;m seriously thinking that &#8220;this is my next&#8221;.</p>
<p>I like what he said. He understands what war is &#8220;winnable&#8221; and what isn&#8217;t. <br />
They already have a relationship with business and enterprise customers and the focus will be convincing those guys not to leave RIM.</p>
<p>Those guys dont care about xmas and will be on contracts that last 2/3 yrs. They dont want their next fleet orders to be iOS or Android so RIM will try to convince them to stay. The Balance thing is quite cool and will be something that Enterprise want and Android/iOS dont have.</p>
<p>I think RIM will concentrate on provide a service or set of solutions for business / corporate users rather than just selling them a phone. Apple / Samsung / Google have nothing like that kind of service for enterprise so I think thats something that separates them from that crowd.</p>
<p>As for MS, yes they have a big name in Enterprise. But so do Blackberry. I dont think MS has put much time into enterprise services for Windows Phone. They have spent their time trying to compete with Apple and Google for market share but I doubt they have sales people going &#8220;door to door&#8221; as it were selling the whole solution, I think RIM will be doing that type of selling to corporates and giving far more sophisticated control over workers phones than MS can (if the Balance thing is working well).</p>
<p>I think MS will be caught sleeping again, trying to be jack of all trades while others (Apple, Google, RIM) pick at their markets and win.</p>
<p>I wouldnt bet against Thorston, he does seem to know what hes doing.</p>
<p>I agree</p>
<p>two germans interviwew :-) compared to the interview on engadget TH looks much more tired in his one. i prefer the one on engadget. it is shorter plus better content.</p>
<p>Would have been awesome if they did the interview in German!</p>
<p>I could barely even push myself through watching the video. How anyone working at RIM deludes themselves into believing they have a chance is beyond me. Let&#8217;s break it down :</p>
<p>- BB10 delayed again. Couldn&#8217;t possibly compete with iOS/Android/WP8 and so are attempting to launch separately. After Christmas. OK. Carriers knew BB10 couldn&#8217;t compete and so are fine to push it back.</p>
<p>- 10 second pitch : connected users who get things done. Oh, that&#8217;s totally unique to all of your competitors. None of them support users, or connectivity, or getting things done! Oh wait, it&#8217;s easier to get things done with a product that you can actually buy. Today.</p>
<p>- This is the guy they have talking to the press? Really?</p>
<p>- Need to find the &#8216;bullseye&#8217; segement &#8211; seems like iOS and Android found pretty big bullseyes.</p>
<p>What a train wreck. Can&#8217;t look away though&#8230;</p>
<p>Something to mention, carriers absolutely <i>love</i> BB10. They&#8217;re promoting it after everyone else gets a chance, and BB10 is the only phone OS on that stage.</p>
<p>BB has real multitasking &#8211; that should&#8217;ve been their pitch. Flow should be their pitch to, with the pure gesture interface.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s the CEO, he has to whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Not a train wreck. It looks very useful. Just the aesthetics are kind of crap.</p>
<p>Yep. It is painful to watch. People at RIM are very brave for not just walking off and seeing it through to the bitter end.</p>
<p>Troll</p>
<p>Not at all. Really, think about someone working there, surrounded by a flood of rumour and speculation. Constant maximum pressure while everyone is breathing down one&#8217;s neck. That is certainly a brave effort not leaving the ship, the engine room filling up section by section.</p>
<p>The people remaining at RIM though are the people who WANT to be there. They&#8217;re the ones dedicated to the platform, seeing it through and giving it all they got to help make it succeed. Those are the kind of people you want working there.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Sounds like they&#8217;re getting gradually more realistic, but until they acknowledge these two points, or behave like they&#8217;ve acknowledged them internally, RIM is simply counting down the days until wind-up.</p>
<p>1. touchscreen smartphones and tablets are and will be locked up in some combo of iOS, Android and Windows.   RIM can&#8217;t get these customers back.<br />
2. non-touchscreen smartphones and tablets are dead (as far as margin and the high volume markets in the first and second world go).</p>
<p>That means RIM needs something big-next-thing, like a glasses-style project, and they need to deliver before Apple and Google.   In short, they&#8217;re dead.</p>
<p>Oh, and a product launch in January/Feb?   That&#8217;s just moronic from a retail standpoint. There&#8217;s no other word for it.   So the only conclusion is that BB10 was nowhere near ready.</p>
<p>People buy new products all the time I own an iPad, iPhone and blackberry play book, and will also own a bb10 device, so just before other are already invested doesn&#8217;t mean they can&#8217;t be part of 2 ecosystems or to a lesser extant switch platforms.</p>
<p>And actually as retail store owner, it&#8217;s actually a good move releasing in jan/feb, the holiday season will have so many phones being released, it be harder to market a new product in at that time, especially when carriers are having sales on most devises, jan/feb allows then to be the main focus for carriers and marketing at that time. Blackberry has always been a business phone first and corporations don&#8217;t buy phones for the holiday season, they buy them whenever and on contracts that can extend up to 3 years.</p>
<p>But phones often have contract cycles and after the big holiday push you always see a retail dip.   It&#8217;s not a good time to launch.  As far as enterprise they only buy new handsets on a cycle based on contracts with carriers and having to replace busted hardware in combination.</p>
<p>Whatever drugs he is on, I want some!</p>
<p>BB10 launches in January 2013!</p>
<p>+bb10</p>
<p>He&#8217;s on bb10</p>
<p>Hard to comeback in this industry, but Apple, IBM, and Cisco prove its not impossible. Realistic prediction: they&#8217;ll produce a good (not great) platform thats simply far too late be competitive.</p>
<p>I know the headline is slightly rephrased, but that (&#8220;we only have one shot&#8221;) is a pretty eyebrow-raising statement.  This time next year, if BB10 hasn&#8217;t turned things around for RIM, how are the people working on BB11 going to feel about that?<br />
Like a lot of people, especially people who&#8217;ve worked in business IT, I can see how BB <em>should</em> be great for in-house systems, groupware type stuff, and other things that Apple and Google (and so far, Microsoft) have zero interest in.  Except this guy is still all &#8220;we need 100,000 apps herp derp&#8221; as if apps were just abstract white dots and users were Pac-Man.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t even <em>matter</em> whether BB10 sucks as an iPhone competitor; what matters is whether it sucks, period.  But I think RIM&#8217;s problem, like a lot of companies whose lunch Apple has eaten, is an inability to understand whether their products are any good or not.</p>
<p>I bet this man <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM7fIq4F330&feature=plcp" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM7fIq4F330&amp;feature=plcp</a> never imagned he be interviewing the RIM CEO in 6 years time&#8230;</p>
<p>LOL. I like this cat. It was a dog in a former life.</p>
<p>The rage I have against people who keep saying RIM lost it&#8217;s chance years ago/they&#8217;re dead/etc can&#8217;t be put in words. Unless you are a founder of a startup/ceo whatever, don&#8217;t speak. You don&#8217;t know how to run a business.</p>
<p>I agree, they make stupid statements, I&#8217;d like to know if they have 2.5 billion + in the bank</p>
<p>Touch screen without swiping keyboard is dead-on-arrival for such chat phones (I mean BBM).</p>
<p>iOS doesn&#8217;t have swiping and it&#8217;s not dead, go back to your bridge troll</p>
<p>RIM is going to have to do some serious damage control to their brand. Even of BB 10 is great, Blackberry&#8217;s are no longer the cool thing amongst young adults. Every person I know who still has a BlackBerry dislikes it now, and they also are the butt of jokes for having one.</p>
<p>But as you said they still have it, and if they up grade sometime after the launch of bb10, they&#8217;ll probably end up with a bb10 phone to keep there bbm contacts etc.</p>
<p>Just go and die RIM. Please. Don&#8217;t make new customers suffer, like what some of my relatives experienced on your abomination of a phone, Bold and Curve and Torch and pretty much everything you offered. Booting up takes forever, keys automatically presses twice/more, ugly screen, ugly UI, ugly applications, ugly email client, ugly camera, ugly music player, ugly speakers, UGLY EVERYTHING! The only good thing about you is the BBM. Which sucks now because we already have Viber and WhatsApp which are useable via WiFi btw, not just mobile data. Just go die please. And never come back from the grave.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t care for their devices, don&#8217;t buy them and move on. But certainly my experience and opinion are different than yours&#8230;</p>
<p>boot up time is due to the fact that BB were the only phones which did (still do) full, on device, data encryption. security at the expense of convenience.</p>
<p>iOS data is encrypted as well.  It has two levels.  The first is basic encryption more in line with secure erase capability.  Once you passcode lock the phone whoever other data becomes encrypted on a second level.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to say it, RIM probably won&#8217;t make it through this. While Windows Phone doesn&#8217;t have a huge market share, it is increasing steadily. RIM has been declining quarter after quarter, and the install base they claim to have is shrinking daily. Had they launched BB10 this month to compete against Windows 8, they might have a change just to keep their numbers. As it is, Windows Phone 8 is a pretty awesome OS, and they finally have some really high quality and innovative phones, they should have one heck of a holiday season, to overtake RIM once and for all, and by the time BB10 does arrive, it might very well be dead.</p>
<p>They are reporting each quarter that their installed based has been on increase, yet you claim its been shrinking daily?? :O Do you have some facts that RIM don&#8217;t have that you would want to share with the rest of us?</p>
<p>RIM has been at zero user growth with most of the losses in the enterprise being stemmed by emerging markets with low cost phones.  They&#8217;ve also been losing money.</p>
<p>Zero user growth?? is that a fact or an opinion?<br />
They are losing money but to say their user base has zero growth is a bit arrogant.</p>
<p>Read it a little while back.  Think it was in October?</p>
<p>Your reading it doesn&#8217;t make it fact, nor does when you read it. We are interested in the source you read it from, though.</p>
<p>Google it, I am sure it will pop up.</p>
<p>There is user growth. You are mixing up market share increase with user base growth. user base growth for RIM is much larger than WP as is RIMs market share each month. However there is no market share growth which contrary to the above is the same with WP</p>
<p>they are both declining</p>

<p>Nice interview Dieter!</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait till after the launch event. It&#8217;s going to be great to watch and see how many who proclaimed RIM dead roll back their hate.</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>I have my favorites on Twitter stuffed with tweets along those lines. My portfolio is thankful for these people who helped lower the share price for me to load up cheap and now reaping the benefits!</p>
<p>&#8220;had&#8221;</p>
<p>best wishes. but it&#8217;s all about content now. improve it then you&#8217;ll be just fine.</p>
<p>Could somebody please drag RIMs bloated and bleeding corpse behind the barn, put a bullet in its head and put it (and all of us!) out of its misery.</p>
<p>Blackberry is dead, dead, dead. And all the CEOs on publicity tours in the world won&#8217;t do anything to change it.</p>
<p>Sorry Thorsten. It&#8217;s not your fault, RIM is just two years too late with delivering a modern smartphone experience, and lets face it. From what we&#8217;ve seen (Between previews and developer handsets that&#8217;s we&#8217;ve pretty much seen 90% of it) BB10 isn&#8217;t up to snuff. It&#8217;s ugly, the UI is weird and stale, and trying to make standard features exciting by giving them a fancy name (Peek, LOL! Or Flow) is soooo 2002. Then again, so is the rest of RIM&#8230;</p>
<p>You do realize that those are previews not showing the full OS right but dev previews. The internal OS versions are much higher than the ones given to the public so I suggest you do more research.</p>
<p>Though his views seem very premature, if a business already has a fleet of BlackBerrys they may upgrade. However, I see no reason why any individual would choose BB over an Android or the iPhone. And with BYOD becoming more and more common this is going to become more and more a problem for RIM.</p>
<p>BYOD won&#8217;t be as much of a problem if they&#8217;re the ones behind the scenes controlling all those non-BB devices with Mobile Fusion. People tend to forget, RIM embraced BYOD in many ways. They can either be the devices people are bringing or be the software those others device I rely on to work. Good strategy that gets overlooked.</p>
<p>I seem to recall from RIM&#8217;s famous advert in 2010 that they were &#8216;so 2008&#8217;.</p>
<p> RIM is headed for the worst. Playbook barely sold. Business are using iPhones instead of blackberries so this will more than likely go down like HP&#8217;s WebOS.</p>
<p>The <em>only </em>reason RIM existed was their ability to push email from Microsoft&#8217;s Exchange: Business bought a box off them, plugged into their Exchange server, and email started appearing on their Blackberry handsets. And it was that simple too. Very reliable. Business loved it.</p>
<p>Exchange now does all that&#8230; And it pushes to anything. It&#8217;s easier to WP but Android and iOS is pretty easy too.</p>
<p>What has Heins said that means we still <em>need </em>Blackberry? <br />
<strike>Why buy their box?</strike> Why buy their handsets?</p>
<p>Plus look into his red eyes &#8211; He looks shot through</p>
<p>I see Heins, I see the demo of the BB10 and all I can do is yawn.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought RIM is done for a year now and this interview has changed my mind a little.  <br />
Without going into comments and a tech savy discussion I just want to think simple here.<br />
I guess at some point, it is about customer perception.  And I thought after this interview RIM has a way out of this mess.<br />
RIM has a base(I think they&#8217;ve lost that &#8220;fan&#8221; base in US, though they still have enterprise I guess.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still not believing Elop though.:)</p>
<p>So who is going to buy RIM?  Will it be Microsoft or Nintendo?</p>
<p>Licensing will be available if they feel like giving BB10 a try&#8230;</p>
<p>microsoft will buy nokia.</p>
<p>I have never used a BB device.</p>
<p>That being said, I like Thorstein as a CEO,  and I like what I see in BB10 so far. I really hope this platform does take off.</p>
<p>The man hardly inspires confidence. I felt like he himself didn&#8217;t even believe what he was saying. I&#8217;m surprised they&#8217;ve got any shareholders left.</p>
<p>Those poor souls, their stock gained 17% on this very day.</p>
<p>Hmm, that&#8217;s true. maybe he&#8217;s trying to just appeal to them. Plus, his quotes will look good in text form, but not necessarily when I can see his talking.</p>
<p>Why do they need to build their own ecosystem? I understand they need to compete with different companies, but the majority of people who invest in digital media have it in one, maybe two, services. I&#8217;m currently considering a Kindle Fire because I have my services locked up in Amazon. BBX could be the best software ever created, but, I&#8217;m not going to dump a thousand dollars on the Blackberry Music Store.</p>
<p>There is no need for any walled garden, and Amazon is bringing its video to other platforms, so why not do an app for BB10? Plus in terms of content distribution, to what level have the big players deployed their content worldwide, and ultimately have they been able to showcase national content&#8230; because lots of people watch movies / listen to music from the US etc. but TV is sometimes quite different and they&#8217;re not all going to start reading books in English all of a sudden because the stores have them. The whole issue goes way beyond any specific product.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they are trying to build their own eco-system. I think they are trying to build a &#8220;solution&#8221; for their customers. They&#8217;ve identified their core customer, the enterprise user and are making products/services to solve the users problems. If anything I see them being LESS proprietary (i.e. html5 /adobe tool sets, Android compatibility).</p>
<p>The eco-system war is over. If you want to survive you have to be Apple compatible or completely open (unless its books where Amazon has won).</p>
<p>I hope BB10 will be a success !<br />
I live in Paris, France and i saw less and less blackberries in the metro while i was seeing quite a lot of BlackBerry curve juste a year before.</p>
<p>I used to have a bold 9000 then a Torch 9800 but i sold both and got a HTC ONE X instead. If RIM make things right maybe i will come back to their side.</p>
<p>If you release these apps i will get a BlackBerry BB10 on Day One :</p>

<p>Thorsten Heins wants your number.</p>
<p>One shot&#8230;. in the head?</p>
<p>man this guy looks like such a bro</p>
<p>This is where he f-d it all up&#8230;..&#8216;RIM will need to build a multimedia ecosystem to complement its business services. The company is holding those cards closer to its chest, with &quot;partnerships in place that we will unveil on January 30th&#8217;.</p>
<p>So&#8230;.everyone who&#8217;s now going to go out and buy new iOS, Windows and Android devices during and just after the holiday season (sales!) will now be off of RIM&#8217;s possible customer list for the next year, probably two.</p>
<p>Launch in January, and if by some fluke they get their devices out quickly they STILL won&#8217;t get a vast uptake because so many companies (particularly in this financial climate) will not be spending on the run up to the business year-end at the end of March.</p>
<p>So&#8230;.essentially he&#8217;s hoping that come April/May businesses will start considering taking the risk of going back to a flailing RIM.  Unlike Microsoft with Windows Phone, RIM only have so much to fall back on before they collapse.</p>
<p>im really digging what RIM has in store for blackberry 10, the UI looks really nice compared to the old design of blackberry OS. All we need now is just to see the new tablet interface that they have in store. i might consider switching from a windows phone if they keep this up but first we need to see some new hardware.</p>
<p>So&#8230; Essentially, what this CEO said is that if the BB10 launch goes well he has ideas for other things he would like to do.  LOL ok</p>
<p>Reminiscent of Unix vs Windows, this time as a mobile OS.<br />
So QNX vs Windows 8. Oh yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kinda buying his sales pitch, to be honest. I currently carry two iPhones, one personal (Verizon), one work-issued (AT&amp;T). Once in stock, I will be swapping my AT&amp;T iPhone for a Naxus 4. But no matter which way I cut it, I am running two phones. I would love to leave my personal phone at home during the work week, but I don&#8217;t want to use my work phone as a personal device, but the idea of having a divide within one device, for personal and business, is incredibly attractive to me.</p>
<p>*Nexus is what I meant, of course.</p>
<p>mehh&hellip;.</p>
<p>It is the best phone out there..tell meh to the iphone 5</p>
<p>iPhone 5 &ndash; meh</p>
<p>:D , it may be good. But &ldquo;<em>the best phone out there</em>&rdquo;? I doubt it. You didn&rsquo;t even hold one yet&hellip;</p>
<p>I did, and it&rsquo;s the best phone out there&hellip;  ;)</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a RIM employee or have close ties to them&hellip; Or lying/trolling. Your assertions don&rsquo;t really hold up well either way.</p>
<p>Calm down, he&rsquo;s just some guy on the internet&hellip;</p>
<p>Hey, I have too and I&rsquo;m willing to put my name on the line. It&rsquo;s an amazing contender to what is currently on the market. I didn&rsquo;t think RIM had it in them to even come CLOSE on this product but I think the added time for fit and finish has really shown. It&rsquo;s a great phone and a great OS and thats coming from someone who has bought every iPhone iteration since the iPhone 3G as my daily driver.</p>
<p>And about the most expensive with a terrible ecosystem.</p>
<p>Dear god I hope that is a case in the picture!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the dev alpha device.<br />RIM simply delivered Z10 to developers some months ago, calling it a &ldquo;dev alpha device&rdquo; for development-only, while hided the design with a lot of plastic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually the back of the Z10.</p>
<p>Yes. That is a teaser image posted by RIM a while back.</p>
<p>Edit: Fixed typo. I love editing!</p>
<p>TheVerge changed the pictured of the article. Previously it was showing a Dev Alpha.</p>
<p>Nope.<br />
As other have stated, that teaser image is a Z10. But here is photo evidence. Perhaps Ohope now it looks less overkill?<br /><img title="Z10 and Batt Door" src="http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MG_2246.jpg" alt="Z10 and Batt Door" /><br />
If its similar to my puny Curve 3G it will feel excellent.</p>
<p>Looks generic and unexciting.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the Nexus 7 back kinda like this too?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the stock battery cover. If you don&rsquo;t like it you can get a different one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you&rsquo;ll be paying &pound;47 per month for 3GB of data and unlimited talk and text for 24 months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think Vodafone gets it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pretty regular pricing for Vodafone.</p>
<p>thats a steal compared to american prices</p>
<p>The price would have made more sense if it was say a 18-month contract. 75 USD a month for 2 years, that&#8217;s a little bit too greedy.</p>
<p>I pay $85 a month for unlimited text and minutes and 1gb data, and the phone cost $200. This is a nice deal</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a nice deal? . . .  Well I guess I don&rsquo;t know what a nice deal is.</p>
<p>Please, enlighten us.</p>
<p>I pay 45&euro;/month for iPhone 5 with unlimited 7Mbit/s data, 600min and 250SMS. No upfront costs. 2 year contract. I could have also paid 600&euro; for the phone upfront and 20&euro;/month.</p>
<p>For a 50mbit/s it would be 20&euro;/month more and for 100mbit/s 30&euro;/month more.</p>
<p>I think that is an ok price. I live in Finland.</p>
<p>Well maybe free market in the tel.co market means that the companies are free to rape your wallets as much as they like?</p>
<p>I think he means Vodafone pricing, not what he currently pays.</p>
<p>If I want a contract I have to have it minimum 3 years and the lowest price per month is $50 which comes for 150 MB.</p>
<p>Its terrible in the UK.</p>
<p>Steal? I pay $89 for 500MB and 60 min talk, no text included (R$ 0,39 for each sms). That&rsquo;s a ripoff, but our reality. And the average price for top devices like iPhone ou Galaxy SII is $ 1.000</p>
<p>Yes, but in the same shop sitting next to this device will be a Galaxy Ace; free handset, free minutes, free text, free data for only &pound;12.50 per month. You&rsquo;d have the REALLY want the Blackberry to pay so much more.</p>
<p>But the data limit there is, what, 250 Mb? And Vodafone charge &pound;5 for each 250 Mb you go over the allowance by, or you sign up for extra to your contract every month &pound;15 for 2 gb if I recall).<br />
For whatever reason, Blackberry devices for free are on higher tariffs than equivalent competitors.</p>
<p>The high price is probably Vodafone unwilling to heavily subsidize an untried OS and smartphone. The phone itself shouldn&rsquo;t be more expensive than similar ranked phones.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a good deal compared to the US</p>
<p>And its a terrible deal compared to other operators in the UK. For example, Three will most likely offer the same phone, with 500 minutes, 10,000 text and unlimited data for &pound;36 a month with &pound;59 up front.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s quite good, for Vodafone (1gb allowance plans are around the &pound;36 mark).<br />
I&rsquo;m stuck with them for now, but even EE makes more sense financially (and the Vodafone network where I am has gone to hell).</p>
<p>EE does not make more sense, their service is horrible.</p>
<p>Sorry about that, I was referring to the data allowances, should have been clearer on that one.<br />
The full 4G isn&rsquo;t even in my area for crying out loud&hellip;</p>
<p>That top contract price is insane for an unproven OS, wonder if their 4G prices will be higher</p>
<p>Really looking forward to price plans being released for 4G in the UK, EE&rsquo;s is an obvious premium and more competition will hopefully start to lower 4G prices!</p>
<p>Unproven?</p>
<p>As in no-one knows what BB10 is like with it being a large departure for RIM.</p>
<p>i seriously want this, but not on voda, way overpriced, even with my discount at work (work at a phone shop) its still too high</p>
<p>RIM announced that there are no carrier exclusives. You can expect that the phones will be available on most carriers in your area.</p>
<p>RIMs final hooray&hellip;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>They have a far better shot than Ubuntu/Tizen at the moment.</p>
<p>Windows Phone is backed by massive coffers, but little else.</p>
<p>BB10 looks like it&rsquo;s actually innovative.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve seen, their OS is just a mash-up of Android, WP and even Meego. I have yet to see anything really of their own (= something innovative).</p>
<p>Pretty impressive that they&rsquo;re selling the devices on the day of the announcement.  Very Apple-like.</p>
<p>Another surprisingly smart move by RIM&hellip; I think we&rsquo;ve all underestimated the man that is Thorsten Heins.</p>
<p>LONG LIVE THOR!</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t Thorsten basically stuck to the original plan?</p>
<p>I agree. This is seriously a great move by RIM. But a part of me do wonder whether enough hype for Z10 and BB10 are present to justify this. I really wish we won&rsquo;t see a launch akin to Sega Saturn launch again.</p>
<p>Kinda but we have been waiting for it for 2 years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if any of us readers have been waiting. Pretty sure we&rsquo;ve all moved on. A lot of businesses haven&rsquo;t though and I honestly think a lot of people want something fresh.</p>
<p>I have been waiting, as soon as I have the money (poor student here) I will be getting one.</p>
<p>I have a iPhone 5 I bought brand new, I&#8217;ve been waiting and will update to a z10. I still got my iPad for apps, the only thing missing is a phone, in which ill have on my bb z10.</p>
<p>Seriously hope the same can be said for Verizon in the US&hellip;not going to hold my breath though&hellip;</p>
<p>That would be EPIC.</p>
<p>Looking forward to this being released in the UK. Although, in all honesty I can see the keyboard functionality being copied (or adapted) into existing keyboard Apps such as SwiftKey, etc.</p>
<p>I would hope it would come from SwiftKey as RIM are licensing the keyboard tech from them.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t due to the license RIM has with Swift key to use there under lining software, another developer could, as one did on iOS but it was not near the same experience, could call it a fail(jailbreak app)</p>
<p>I have no interest in the Z10 but the QWERTY device on the other hand I am excited about, hopefully it comes soon to the UK too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been told the same at O2. Announced 30th, launched 31st. I took that to mean we&rsquo;d have them in, but couldn&rsquo;t give a monkeys so haven&rsquo;t investigated further. I&rsquo;m gonna go out on a limb and guess our prices are very similar to Vodas.</p>
<p>Vodafone have ability to sell them from 5pm on the 30th. I know its not a &lsquo;deal breaker&rsquo;, but carrier support is what BB10 needs to succeed.</p>
<p>The turnaround on this is insane, even Apple only manage a couple of weeks from announce to shelf. If this can match the traction of WP8, they&rsquo;ve got a real chance.</p>
<p>I am having a lot of trouble believing that this is the true launch time. I really hope it is real, but I just don&rsquo;t see it happening.</p>
<p>If it is we should be seeing these phones show up at retailers tomorrow they need time to inventory and set up displays</p>
<p>Probably dearer than Voda, o2 are rip off merchants.</p>
<p>Thought that said Black Barry Zito.</p>
<p>Need to blink more often.</p>
<p>It keeps reminding me of that Hyundai i10 car.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having IT nightmares, regarding BES installations.</p>
<p>Hey, it&rsquo;s no big deal.  Just need to buy an additional server (or build another VM), configure it all and run it in parallel with the old BES since the old BBs won&rsquo;t work with BB10.  So now IT will need to support two BES environments until all the old BBs get rolled over to the new models.  Clearly money and time is no object.</p>
<p>That sounds like most system transitions I&rsquo;ve ever heard of&hellip;</p>
<p>Same here</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had fun trying (though I&rsquo;m a newb for sure)</p>
<p>Trying though :)</p>
<p>The BB10 devices have user-replaceable batteries and MicroSD slots which is awesome.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to hoping that Big Red does the same as Vodafone.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a great chance I will be back on Verizon this week if this is the case.</p>
<p>How so? Vodafone does not have a controlling stake on Verizon.</p>
<p>Thawkth didn&rsquo;t say that because Vodafone did something, Verizon will too. He simply said that if Verizon released the Z10 today (which we now know won&rsquo;t be the case), he&rsquo;ll switch back to Verizon.</p>
<p>But they are both big and red?</p>
<p>(Vodafone has over 400 million customers, and prime colour is red and white, where Verizon is red and black)</p>
<p>Sure, but Vodafone has never been a US brand (it owned AirTouch for less than three months before VZW was created). Also, Verizon Communications had about $42 billion more in revenue than Vodafone for 2012.</p>
<p>I wonder how good this phone will actually be, after that I wonder whether it will sell enough units to allow RIM to survive or even beat WP8.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the price that RIM are pushing then bb10 is DOA in the UK. For an unproven platform and first device of its type for RIM that price is astoundingly out of touch.</p>
<p>If its Voda being rip off merchants then RIM might have a chance in the UK because they still retain decent brand loyalty in some demographics</p>
<p>If your reading this and thinking &quot; huh what&#8217;s he saying? that&#8217;s a great price&quot; you obviously don&#8217;t understand the UK market.</p>
<p>I honestly think that RIM (especially as they have CMO Frank Boulben) has far more knowledge of every carrier business around the globe than <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>Vodafone has generally terrible plans. They have terrible 3G coverage (although their 4G coverage will probably smash that in a few months). But I know a lot of business users use them because of their relatively good roaming deals.</p>
<p>Unproven Platform? So you want the company to give away its flagship device?</p>
<p>I hope you never end up running a company.</p>
<p>Good to see, out my iPhone 5 up for sale last night $650 to add to buying my new z10.</p>
<p>I think a new term called &ldquo;seller&rsquo;s remorse&rdquo; should be invented. Granted, it&rsquo;s still probably way better and more innovative than any iDevice.</p>
<p>Too expensive. I&rsquo;m paying &pound;26 p/month for 300 minutes, 500 text and 750MB of data. And my phone, a HTC One X, was free!</p>
<p>Damn, I&rsquo;m paying &pound;19 p/month for 100 minutes, unlimited text and 5000MB of data. But my phone cost me &pound;222!</p>
<p>Presumably you need the texts? 200m/500t/Unlimited Data is &pound;13 on Three.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s much better than both of our plans!</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t tether or create a wireless hotspot with that plan</p>
<p>This ugly dumb (smart)phone looks so uninspiring. Plus the douchey &uuml;bersized front logo makes it a no-go!</p>
<p>Looks nice. Oh oh oh.</p>
<p>I think it would bode well for rim/blackberry if (some) of the hardware lineup was available at or close to launch day, pretty smart if it&rsquo;s true. <br />
 <br />
- another <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong> in this document is that you <strong>DO NOT NEED</strong> any type of &ldquo;blackberry only&rdquo; service contract to access their network/services(BBM,etc), this still seems to be a <strong>COMMON MISCONCEPTION</strong> that many smartphone users have of this upcoming product line</p>
<p>- the bb10 OS offers a number of <strong>COMPELLING and UNIQUE features</strong> ( list/details <a href="http://sospep.com/view/article?id=796#content" target="_blank">http://sospep.com/view/article?id=796#content</a> ) that NO OTHER SMARTPHONE currently has</p>
<p>- the leaked hardware specs and photos look pretty darned impressive as well,</p>
<p>- if &ldquo;the steak&rdquo; lines up with &ldquo;the sizzle&rdquo;, this could be a huge win for RIMM and its Blackberry brand!</p>
<p>Awesome!</p>
<p>really impressed with the direction RIM took, the flow and peek UX is very intuitive and held me captive since they announced, I can&#8217;t wait to ditch my S3 although I like it but can&#8217;t stand touchwiz, phone UI and email on it.</p>
<p>Have you tried using a different launcher?  Give Nova or Apex a try.  Stock look and feel, lots of customization.</p>
<p>Thats said, I really hope BB does well.  I&#8217;ve liked what I&#8217;ve seen so far.</p>
<p>yep I am currently running the Nova and Nova Prime, the point is still Samsung meddled with the stock apps like email, calendar, phone and contacts and nothing can change that, the experience on these apps is so bad especially when you are coming from a Nexus device. I even went to the point of rooting the device to run AOKP and othe ROM&#8217;s, the problem with the ROM&#8217;s it works when it works and you know sometimes it won&#8217;t work when you need the most, also the integrity and security of the hacks going into a custom ROM is questionable. That said I thought of buying a Nexus 4 but LTE is a deal breaker. Again IMO IOS on a tablet is pretty nice but on a phone it sucks big time no matter how many apps you have. What are the alternatives I am left with? here comes BB10 like godsend&#8230;</p>
<p>Security is not questionable unless you&#8217;re going to a really shady rom.</p>
<p>And unless you&#8217;re using a nightly, everything will work in the stable release of AOKP/AOSP</p>
<p>Point being if you have to hack your phone(which the vast majority will not do)to get it to work right their is something wrong.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference with &#8220;work right&#8221;  and &#8220;not your taste&#8221;.  Touchwizz works fine. It just might not gel with how you like to do things &#8230; then Android allows you to hack anything you need.</p>
<p>These complaints about things like the Calendar are easily fixed.. many good free apps available. That&#8217;s not really a hack is it?</p>
<p>use any Nexus device for a month and then use a S3, then come back to tell me the samething what you said now.</p>
<p>Have been using a Galaxy Nexus now for a year, have also used an S3 and considering a Note 2, different flavors of Android aren&#8217;t any less or more than others, just different.</p>
<p>I greatly disagree with you. As an iPhone user, I instantly notice the dumpster fire that is &#8220;skinned&#8221; Android compared to the real, legit, stock Android on my Galaxy Nexus or my friends Nexus 4.  It&#8217;s night and day in every way, frigged up, ugly icons everywhere, bloated and no updates.</p>
<p>Like Joshua Topolsky, I could never seriously consider non stock Android as my main device.</p>
<p>I was thinking the same but after being tired of a ridicolous battery life i switched from a Galaxy Nexus to a Motorola Razr i (available here in Europe). Stock Android it&#8217;s just around the corner, a very few different icons and a few Motorola extra&#8217;s that make my experience actually smoother than on the Nexus one. I&#8217;m only missing Google Now at this point and i hope to get soon my update to Jelly Bean. More than software, device it&#8217;s beautiful, perfect size, very thin and battery almost never dies. And.i want to support Motorola from now on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been running stock Android 4.2.1 on my Nexus 4 since getting it last month and I had nothing but complaints.  Coming from a BlackBerry Torch 9800 (stay with me here) I had so many productivity complaints that my girlfriend stopped listening to me.  I upgraded to Cyanogenmod 10.1 nightly last night, and so much has been improved.   I may actually be able to use my phone to help organize my life again!  I can&#8217;t speak for anyone else, and I&#8217;m not really an experienced Android user, but my time on  stock 4.2.1 was a good introduction to the OS, but it was so lacking in features, and woefully inconsistent that I actually considered getting a micro sim adapter and going back to my BlackBerry.    I&#8217;d go into it more, but I get tired of rehashing the same complaints and everyone I asked gave the same reply that seemed to be; &#8220;get x app, get y app and hope they work together.&#8221;.  I think the OS should be able to perform basic functions out of the box.  It&#8217;s great that I can whittle away hours in the app store finding things to add, but I shouldn&#8217;t have to just to make the dang phone work.   Cyanogenmod impressed me so much, it may be able to keep me away from BB10.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, can I ask what changes the Cyanogenmod Rom contained made you satisfied with productivity? And can you explain what you mean by woefully inconsistent?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not seeing the productivity connection. CM10 has many benefits, but I don&rsquo;t see what the Rom does that helps. Do you mean ease/speed of navigation? Also, what about stock Android is inconsistent?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gone from S3 &#8211; Gnex- N4 and guess what&#8230; I&#8217;m back on the S3. I still have the Gnex too because I think it&#8217;s a great phone .</p>
<p>FWIW I find the Samsung dialer superior to the stock just because it has T9 dialing.  The official stock calendar is available from the Play Store.</p>
<p>and swipe left/right to call message is incredibly handy, I really miss that when I use a Nexus.</p>
<p>Yes! Stock Android dialers suck dearly :-) Flat out lazy effort and non-productive.</p>
<p>CM also has T9 dialing, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>The swipe left/right to call/text is pure genius, though. No argument there.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; it. Not any different from installing a &ldquo;better&rdquo; version of Windows. A more apt description is different Linux distros, but I doubt most people are familiar with that ecosystem. It&rsquo;s not a hack. It&rsquo;s understanding how to install an OS to your computer hardware.</p>
<p>Secondly, a different Launcher won&rsquo;t require a reinstall of the OS and will get you (more or less) Stock capabilities with some additional customization. It&rsquo;ll swap out the Dock and some other parts of the phone&rsquo;s OS.</p>
<p>Also, I understand you might not agree, but after years of hearing iPhone users saying &ldquo;Well my phone can do all the things Android can do if I jailbreak it&rdquo;, now the argument is turning towards &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not a stock feature on every device then it doesn&rsquo;t count&rdquo;? They&rsquo;re mutually exclusive. Either everything needs to work out of box or hacking is totally valid. Personally, I&rsquo;m siding with the latter; people should learn to use their tools. Not understanding how to use a ROM is like complaining that the Freeway is too hard and scary, so you&rsquo;ll only drive your car on side streets. That being said, it should be as easy as possible to do stuff out of the box if it doesn&rsquo;t bloat the OS to provide it. And guess what? Android provides a ton of customization without needing to Root or install a ROM.</p>
<p>Kind of. I&#8217;m running the last milestone release of AOKP and I recently had to manually edit the gps.conf because the gps would take 10-15 minutes to get lock on to a signal. Turns out my local region wasn&#8217;t specific enough using the default settings.</p>
<p>I had different issues with latest builds, WiFi won&#8217;t stay connected and sometimes the camera  crashes.</p>
<p>But for the GS3 the nightlies are the only way to run anything beyond ICS. It&rsquo;s not that simple, not with Samsung&rsquo;s asinine decision to not provide documentation on the Exynos&hellip;</p>
<p>ZOMG Edit! How come there hasn&rsquo;t been a post on this? (Awesome idea to include the timer by the way).</p>
<p>- The Stock Google Calendar is available on Play!<br />
- Phone and contacts &#8230;  exDialer (with ICS theme?)<br />
- E-mail, there are many very capable apps<br />
And that is without even checking out custom roms, have you looked at CM9 or 10 ?</p>
<p>I myself are very happy with Sense 4 on my One X (in a custom rom but still pretty much stock looking), I think Samsung made a mess of it with Touchwizz, Sense 4+ is a much nicer alternative. I do like to use Google Calander over the Sense one though.</p>
<p>I love the idea of the hub, but I&#8217;m sure there will be an app for that on Android down the line! That is the beauty of Android .. stuff just gets made. If you turn out to be unhappy with the Z10 dialer or contacts  &#8230; good luck.</p>
<p>I have tried them and suck in comparison to the stock apps on Jellybean, I currently have K9 email but as I have said it doesn&#8217;t compare to the stock, not to mention contacts and ugly phone UI on S3 (third party apps are rather disappointing compared to stock).  I have been using AOKP nightly builds which is better and less buggy than CM10.1 IMO. What I am saying is Stock is way to go and I want my phone to work out of the box and also I feel third party apps should compliment the stock apps but not completely replace them and if that&#8217;s the case it is better to look else where. If I am buying another Android it will be a Nexus with a LTE.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with you, recent editions of Sense are far better than they used to be, and in my limited experience with the Galaxy S III, much better than TouchWiz.  I still refuse to use anything but stock or CM, though, just because I find that it meshes really well with how I actually use my device, and generally speaking, it feels more fluid to me than any skinned Android has ever felt.</p>
<p>I was also going to mention this, though.  Stock apps are available through the Play Store, and there are a multitude of replacement dialers and email clients.</p>
<p>That said, the hub makes me worry a little.  This would be something for me to check out, but I for some reason really like having my notifications segmented the way they are when I have multiple apps.  That way I don&rsquo;t confuse an email from one account with an email from another, or thing someone tweeted me when they actually Facebook messaged me.  It might sound stupid, but it&rsquo;s another thing that gives me peace of mind when I&rsquo;m checking notifications that my full attention isn&rsquo;t turned to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-mail, there are many very capable apps&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd-Party apps recommended to do basic native functionality, what a nightmare.</p>
<p>To each their own.  I haven&#8217;t known the horrors of touchwiz, but I remember Sense.  Currently on my trusty old Nexus S waiting for my contract to end.</p>
<p>you will begin to recognize it only if you have used a stock OS before..no it&#8217;s not just the touchwiz and the story doesn&#8217;t end there, all your stock are apps are modified as well like phone, contacts, email, messaging etc and the UX is horrible when compared to the stock</p>
<p>Yea, I recall the modifications on my old Hero, but back then the difference wasn&#8217;t as striking as it is now.</p>
<p>Either way, stock or bust.</p>
<p>They were just as striking. Android from back then was a complete mess (from the days of the Hero).</p>
<p>With Android you are not forced to use any of Android apps (email, dialer, sms, calender, contacts).</p>
<p>I heard a lot that people don&#8217;t like Touchwiz and when I got it, it was fine. But I really like Holo theme more what Android itself has. Some Samsung tweaks with a Android framework is not good like how settings does look and how they have changed Android own WWW browser look.</p>
<p>Good thing is that you can change dialer, sms, calender and even install a alternative native Android WWW browser like &#8220;ICS browser+&#8221; <br />
For dialer and sms you can take others but bad thing is, you can not remove Samsung owns from lists as they are tied to framework.</p>
<p>And LTE isn&#8217;t a deal breaker unless you really need pings lower than 50ms and download speed over 21MBits and upload over 7MBits. There is no need for any handset actually have those and for hotspot/tethering task, only very few actually needs anything what LTE offers.</p>
<p>Of course in USA networks are terrible and you can not even get LTE speed what europeans enjoy in 3G.</p>
<p>LTE is deal breaker here in the states</p>
<p>What 3G speeds are Europeans enjoying that compare to LTE in the states? I seriously doubt that.</p>
<p>Flash CyanogenMod. TouchWiz problem solved.</p>
<p>Nova is personal favourite of mine.</p>
<p>I am all for competition as well, but what in this new OS is really new or innovative? I don&#8217;t really see anything ground breaking at all. They just added a few edge gestures&#8230;</p>
<p>not in this video but you will need to look at other videos where they demoed how the flow interface works from app to app.</p>
<p>for example : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Qxxo3Fen_Qw" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Qxxo3Fen_Qw</a></p>
<blockquote>really impressed with the direction RIM took, the flow and peek UX is very intuitive and held me captive since they announced, </blockquote>
<p>I think I&#8217;m with you.  They seem to have taken some inspiration from WP, Web OS and Android and made something that seems kinda cool.  I don&#8217;t know if I would give up my 920 for it but I could definitely see it challenging for my second device.</p>
<p>I had the S3 before I went back to the iPhone. Your right in a way I hated touchwiz. I like the multi-window feature on the newer tocuhwiz I haven&#8217;t tried it but looks cool. I can&#8217;t wait for this phone as well. Going to buy one at launch.</p>
<p>Her blurry?  how did you go about getting a RIM job?</p>
<p>you need help buddy? how does speaking what I like make me supposedly a RIM employee?? If you have read it correctly..I currently own a S3</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t agree more. Might have to ditch my iPhone once it comes out.</p>
<p>But the ladies love Touch Wiz! It has all types of weather!</p>
<p>^ Ditch an S3 for a blackberry? Said no one, ever..</p>
<p>Valid point. Apart from that the guy with the S3 above, ofcourse.</p>
<p>Applications are still going to be a weak point, though.  Most likely.</p>
<p>They took almost everything from MeeGo. Even the camera splash screen looks identical to my N9. I&#8217;m not complaining though, MeeGo is dead so seeing a new OS carry over some of the best features is nice..</p>
<p>N9 doesn&#8217;t have a MeeGo. It has Harmattan what is next generation of Maemo. Last Maemo was 5.0 and Harmattan was new marketing name for Maemo 6.0. <br />
MeeGo was what Intel did alone as Nokia didn&#8217;t accept that work. MeeGo is Maemo 5.0 + Moblin Linux.</p>
<p>MeeGo and Harmattan were not 100% compatible with each other.</p>
<p>And do you know what MeeGo, Harmattan and Android has common?<br />
They both use same Linux operating system. The one big difference was that Android does have Dalvik virtual machine and not common glibc library as Harmattan and MeeGo does. Neither does Android support X11 disply protocol.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true. Harmattan was Maemo version 6 until the merge with Moblin to make MeeGo. Harmattan it&rsquo;s fully Maemo (which already switched from GTK+ to Qt) with the MeeGo brand.<br />
From those two brothers os we have now The Mer Project with Nemo Mobile UI, the Hildon Foundation and finally Jolla with its Sailfish OS.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has a different approach and it&rsquo;s not based on the Linux kernel but it lets Qt shines with Cascades.</p>
<p>At all it seems BlackBerry 10 it&rsquo;s the next step of the development of Nokia N9&rsquo;s Harmattan/MeeGo.<br />
Even the desktop client its going to be called BlackBerry Link, reminding say what of Nokia Link.</p>
<p><a href="http://swipe.nokia.com/design/" target="_blank">http://swipe.nokia.com/design/</a></p>
<p>They even took the dev team!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m serious.</p>
<p>Which one? Maemo&rsquo;s one or MeeGo&rsquo;s one.. It seems most of Nokia MeeGo&rsquo;s devs are working with Jolla right now..</p>
<p>The Astonishing Tribe did a lot of work on MeeGo.</p>
<p>Well, it seems RIM has been sleeping much less than what people think in the last two years.<br />
They have been collecting experience and technology and fusing all of it into the coming BB10.<br />
They&rsquo;ve purchased Documents To Go, Torch Mobile for the browser, JayCut for video editing, QNX for the software and this TAT guys for the design. They&rsquo;re making strong basic principles from webOS, synergy-BB Hub and cards, and MeeGo, swipe, fuse with each other and they&rsquo;re falling in love with developers putting all of it in a beautiful and high quality hardware.<br />
Not to forget all deals for tight integration of services from TomTom, Box, Evernote and 7Digital.<br />
I don&rsquo;t see reason for BlackBerry to be a great come back.</p>
<p>RIM is also one of biggest supporters of Qt right now. With this and the support to HTML5 webworks they can only make it through and get a lot of attention from many and many developers.<br />
I&rsquo;m surely going to stay on Android for a while but BlackBerry 10 has everything it needs to succeed.</p>
<p>I guess we can see why they are paying Nokia.</p>
<p>Still can&rsquo;t decide between the Z10 or the X10&hellip; gosh!</p>
<p>Idiot</p>
<p>I must admit, it actually looks kinda neat</p>
<p>Agreed, the gesture ui seems to be rather simple.</p>
<p>it looks quite nice, from the video I see they took inspiration from iOS and Android, the question remains, why would I choose this over the other established players?</p>
<p>Real-time OS. Apps will run live not just app switching. Gesture based UI, great communication with the all in one BlackBerry Hub. You can even tweet, send facebook messages from the BB Hub. If your about business BBM Video looks cool, screen sharing, live document editing and more. There are alot of other features that hasn&#8217;t been leaked yet. I,E There were early leaks about Cinnamon toast and French toast UI enhancements. I can’t wait for Jan 30th when its officially announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can even tweet, send facebook messages from the BB Hub.&#8221;</p>
<p>This reminds me of WP &#8220;Hub features&#8221;. This is neat yea, but not a selling point.</p>
<p>BB will be interesting in Enterprise, but that&#8217;s it. Customization and alternative apps which can replace stock ones = 0.</p>
<p>its launching with 75,000 apps you halfwit</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Customization and alternative apps which can replace stock ones = 75,000</p>
<p>I really doubt we&#8217;re going to see good apps in that 75,000. I would be shocked if there were more than 10 first party apps.</p>
<p>A large percentage of them are android ported apps that will run in emulation!</p>
<p>is it really emulation though? don&#8217;t they have their own dalvik implementation i.e. its only emulation like android itself is emulation ?</p>
<p>i have been using dev alpha for a while,it uses a omap 4460&hellip;all i can say is that when i ported some apps for my own personal use i felt that the performance was equal to tegra 2 on my bro&rsquo;s Samsung galaxy R.It handles android apps like a native one no hiccups in performance</p>
<blockquote>its launching with 75,000 apps you halfwit</blockquote>
<p>Source?</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s CMO said that they will launch with 75k apps in an interview the other day. I think TheVerge also reported this.</p>
<p>I would take that with a grain of salt. If I read the stats correctly they have 70K+ submitted. A 1000 could be fart apps for all we know. The key thing is are the important apps there? I would guess people use less than a dozen apps on a daily basis and if BB10 has the key ones, app availability won&#8217;t be a short term, launch window opportunity. Hell, the PlayBook launched without a native email app!</p>
<p>^ opportunity &#8211; I meant problem. Hah, I guess I&#8217;ve been reading too many self help books post-New Year :)</p>
<p>The essentials will all be there.  Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>He also said 90% of the top 600 iOS and Android apps will be there, straight from Frank Boulben&#8217;s mouth to FierceWireless in an interview. Is that important enough for you?</p>
<p>ohh  and android has all the beauty apps&hellip;.go fart man,android is flooded with unwanted apps but that are not shown in featured pages so it contributes only towards their no: of apps.Android-Some good apps make the platform popular + many s*** apps which contribute to the quantity of apps</p>
<p><a href="http://pressblue.com/blackberry-10-rebuilt-from-scratch-110000-apps-promised-by-release-date/570/edward-jones">110,000 Apps Promised By Release Date</a></p>
<p>75,000 apps = not much.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t your learnt anything from the WP haters?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget third party developers will also have access to the BlackBerry Hub&#8230; also BB Hub includes calendar not only can you see the upcoming events but u can also see who your meeting with, any interactions you had with them i.e emails, calls etc… also you can select an individual to view a comprehensive bio about the person, their employer, social updates like LinkedIn, FaceBook and Twitter. Plus the availability to peek and flow within applications is a great selling feature for one handed ease of use.</p>
<blockquote>This reminds me of WP "Hub features". This is neat yea, but not a selling point.</blockquote>
<p>Spoken like someone that hasn&#8217;t actually lived with it.</p>
<p>The WP &#8220;Hub&#8221; features are not new. Handy at some sort of situations but mixing IM, SMS and so on isn&#8217;t smart.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what the people hub does.</p>
<p>If it can run Android apps like the playbook then it has a chance of catching on. If not they better do something to motivate devs to develop on their system or they don&#8217;t have a chance.</p>
<p>they did both</p>
<p>Typography looks poor. I don&#8217;t like the design language, looks dated.</p>
<p>Interaction design looks interesting though, and the aggregated BB Hub is nice, but doesn&#8217;t look particularly pretty.</p>
<p>This. </p>
<p>Astute observation, but honestly, I dont think they were going for &#8220;pretty&#8221;, but rather for functionality. IMO, considering their recent downfall, it would be too risky for them to make something completely different from what the consumer has accepted (aka &#8216;dated&#8217; design language). This could very likely have been done on purpose in order to play it safe, and I believe it was the right decision.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s not very pretty, but its easy to read and incredibly efficient to navigate.</p>
<p>Pretty always wins at the end.</p>
<p>Not always. Android 4.x is really nice, but 1 and 2 looked like a dog had regurgitated iOS onto a plastic toy, and it surpassed iOS sales even then. And while WP&rsquo;s UI not unanimously loved, the proportion of people who like do like it (when they see it in motion at least) is way higher than the current WP market share.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more they need elegant typography like a fish needs water. i hope this is not final software. I really want RIM to succeed. this looks great. I hold NO allegiance to any hardware or platform. I  will forever be willing to jump ship from android. (Nexus 4 owner) I can care less how much money i have invested in a platform. I&rsquo;m not going to let that anchor me in to staying when i feel another product could serve me better. To say that i&rsquo;m peeved to see google apps get updated 1st on IOS would be an understatement. Speaking of the devil I hear so many IOS users say i&rsquo;m staying because i have purchased X amount of music, apps, ect ect. I feel differently. I have spent a considerable amount in IOS and android. But i am not going to over look what i am seeing right here from rim. If i can buy a device unlocked with pentaband HSPA+ its going down. but if not i wish them the best of luck. I will stick with nexus.</p>
<p>what? the typo is beautiful</p>
<p>i want it,  i have a blackberry on me as a second phone (pirmary is Nexus 4) and its always been an older cheaper BB, but i think i&#8217;d seriously like that Z10, also, i want to see someone leak BB10 for my PlayBook</p>
<p>This will be my next device. I&#8217;ve considered all-touch before, but I found the keyboard implementations to be either gimmicky and non-productive or woefully underwhelming. It is clear that RIM / BlackBerry intends for their all-touch devices to have the same amazing typing experience that their hard keyboard handsets have always had, and they are having quite a bit of success with it. It is hard to believe that this is a first generation device. I didn&#8217;t think that I would need to camp out in front of the store to get one on launch day, but with features like this and publicity like this, I may need to wake up early.</p>
<p>How long have you worked for BB?</p>
<p>Never. Worked for carriers but never an OEM.</p>
<p>Kinda crazy to me that you&#8217;re saying this is my next, based on a keyboard you&#8217;ve never used before, simply because RIM made devices with good tactile keyboards before. Apple long has the best typing experience on mobile, and then Microsoft really stepped up the typing experience when they launched WP. And Google really stepped up their keyboard with 4.0 two years ago&#8230;.</p>
<p>You think RIM is really going to have a more &#8217;&#8217;amazing&#8217;&#8217; typing experience than what all these guys offer?</p>
<p>I would counter that SwiftKey have the best typing experience on any device from my experience and general observation on most tech blogs and forums. RIM has licensed that technology and built additional features on it as well as mimicking their physical keyboard onto their touch devices such as the frets.</p>
<p>I find it funny that anyone who seems to have a positive comment about RIM/BlackBerry 10 is supposedly a RIM employee</p>
<p>If swiftkey is one of the best typing experiences (i personally hated it), then what makes RIM any different than any of the Android handsets than can run it? It was the best selling app of 2012 on android. The guy said he liked RIM because of the keyboard, and that the keyboard on this device would be amazing, so I said based on what exactly? Since of course, he has never actually used it. I&rsquo;m not attacking him, or attacking RIM so chill&hellip;just asking a question.</p>
<p>But your response is to counter that swiftkey is available? So again I say, what makes this any different? I&rsquo;m pretty sure my first question still stands.</p>
<p>their implementation of it maybe and the design and other features</p>
<p>Haha, so the conversation has basically turned into this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;m going get a BB device because the keyboard is amazing, better than any touch phone I&rsquo;ve considered</li>
	<li>Since you haven&rsquo;t used it, how exactly is it better?</li>
	<li>It&rsquo;s better because it uses swiftkey</li>
	<li>Swift key is also on android, so really, how is it better?</li>
	<li>It <em>might</em> be better&hellip;?</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless the guy was talking about something like the BB Storm which was just an awful device, I fail to see how this makes any sense to anyone.</p>
<p>Swiftkey is NOT on android, is not free, is not built in, is not &ldquo;included&rdquo;.<br />
Therefore is not a characteristic that Android posses.</p>
<p>Swiftkey is being licensed to RIM on their keyboard, but they go further. Swiftkey dont have text prediction on top of the letters, where you can just throw the word to the screen, it is extremely helpful because you dont have to look to the top to get a prediction, you can continue looking at the next letter you will type. You still can change the mode to TOP predictions and they will appear on top of the virtual keyboard.</p>
<p>Another characteristic is Multilanguage text prediction. I need that, perhaps is not good for you but swiftkey does not do this in the same sentence. For example, me that my native language is spanish but I need to write some stuff in english in the same sentece due to work on IT&hellip; I do stuff like: &ldquo;Creo que habr&aacute; un REFRESH en el SERVER despu&eacute;s del GO LIVE programado para despues del Migration and update project&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is a silly example but indeed I need sometimes to get predictions on different languages, at least two at one time.</p>
<p>The multilanguage prediction is one thing that I noticed in the gizmodo walkthrough video that is genuinely new. That&rsquo;s a good feature for anyone that might use it. I&rsquo;m not sure multilingual people will switch phones for something like this, especially when it could be added down the line in any other phone, but we can only wait and see.</p>
<p>As far as swift key not being a characteristic that android posses. Who cares if it doesn&rsquo;t come stock built in, as long as it&rsquo;s able for sale on the platform. It would be different it it were going for $20 or $10, but it&rsquo;s a reasonable $4. That fact that it&rsquo;s a reasonably priced app that people can buy as an option makes it a feature of android. It&rsquo;s no different than comparing other platforms like PC vs Mac and available programs or platform gaming. GT5, Killzone and Uncharted are features for the PS3, you may not necessarily buy them, but they are features for the console which are available for purchase once you buy into that particular platform. Go w/ a 360, you get Halo, Forza, GoW</p>
<p>You can make the argument it&rsquo;s not really a feature of android, but look at swiftkeys own website <br /><img title="" src="http://i.imgur.com/a0NQv.jpg" alt="" /><br />
The fact that they are making their availability for a price the first thing on their website, rather than it being built into BB10 for free should matter <br /><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_medium%3Dgetswiftkey%26utm_campaign%3Dskx" target="_blank">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_medium%3Dgetswiftkey%26utm_campaign%3Dskx</a></p>
<p>Swiftkey is available on Android though, and its as easily available as downloading an app. Why are RIM fans so obsessed with built in functionality? As if the OEM has to preinstall hundreds if applications for the &#8216;too-stupid&#8217; user.</p>
<p>Pretty sad isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t buy the argument that there&rsquo;s no point getting OS X because you can download/buy whatever features it has on OS Y anyway.  If an OEM released a product with a vanilla OS with the expectation that everyone would just configure and customize it with apps from their app store then they would get panned.  There&rsquo;s a big difference between tech oriented people that frequent these sites and have the desire/knowledge to do that, and the man on the street that just wants to buy a product that works well from the moment they turn it on.  That used to be, and arguably still is, a major plus point of iOS &ndash; for 90% of buyers it just works.  The positive of Android is that if you <em>want</em> to customize everything you <em>can</em>.  The argument here between the new BB10 keyboard and Android with SwiftKey is that BB10 has the great keyboard <em>from the start</em> with features you can&rsquo;t even get if you download SwiftKey on Android.  That&rsquo;s not to say those features might not be available soon but for the guy in the shop deciding between two phones, which is he going to chose then and there?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a scenario: A person is shopping for a phone in an ATT, Sprint, Verizon, or T-mobes store, and they pick up a few phones, then finally land on a BB10 device and use swift key and say, oh this is such a wonderful keyboard, this is the only one that has it? Only to find out from the sales rep that&rsquo;s been quietly shadowing them that Android does offer it, so he/she shows them what swiftkey is like on their personal android phone.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen after going into numerous cell phone shops, from multiple carriers, the overwhelming majority of the CSRs carry android devices. You think if someone says &lsquo;&rsquo;oh swiftkey on this is awesome&rsquo;&rsquo; they&rsquo;re not going to point out to customer know-nothing that they wouldn&rsquo;t be forced to get a BB10 if that&rsquo;s what they really wanted?</p>
<p>But the BB10 SwiftKey based keyboard isn&rsquo;t the same as the Android SwiftKey keyboard you can dowload: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-yn9CVOKKY">comparison</a></p>
<p>Other than BB10 swiping up, whereas swiftkey 3 puts the words above the keyboard (Exactly like WP&rsquo;s wordflow does) this video shows absolutely no difference. And BTW, other than choosing themes and drilling down into statistics the functionality in that video is no different than windows phone. I typed &ldquo;Hey&rdquo; then &ldquo;h&rdquo; and &ldquo;how&rdquo; came up and I was able to select "are"+"you"+"doing" with one tap each.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other than BB10 swiping up, whereas swiftkey 3 puts the words above the keyboard (Exactly like WP&rsquo;s wordflow does)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, that seems like quite a big difference in functionality and usability to me.  But hey, if you think all devices should look and function the same, and less choice for the consumer is better, you&rsquo;re entitled to that opinion.</p>
<p>You think swiping up from the letter is functionally superior/more usable than tapping above the keyboard? Really?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never said anything about wanting the consumer to have less choice. What I&rsquo;ve been saying, to people that more and more seem like blackberry zealots, is that people aren&rsquo;t going to break long standing trends and flock to BB10 for a feature that is marginally different than what it&rsquo;s competitors offer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You think swiping up from the letter is functionally superior/more usable than tapping above the keyboard?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My thumb would be going to that key anyway if I were typing the full word so rather than pressing the key I&rsquo;d just flick it and get the whole word.  Seems easier that having to look to see whether the word I want has been suggested and tapping above the keyboard if it has, or pressing another key if it hasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>At the end of the day all devices are functionaly similar, but it&rsquo;s the collection of multiple marginal differences (or fewer major ones) that make people chose one device over another.  The BB10 keyboard is a minor differentiator over Android with SwiftKey and a bigger differentiator over iOS.  If the <em>only</em> difference between two devices were the keyboard, then I agree that probably wouldn&rsquo;t be enough to sway a potential buyer, but BB10 seems to have a lot more than that, its just one feature that&rsquo;s been well demonstrated so far.  People just need to be open minded &ndash; Android was pretty similar to iOS when it first came out and look how it has taken over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple long has the best typing experience on mobile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If you looked at the rest of the sentence, I&rsquo;m sure you would have noticed that it was a typo and should have been <em>had</em> instead of <em>has</em>. If you&rsquo;re doubting that the iPhone had the undisputed best experience on a mobile phone until WP showed up, I think you need to open up your eyes a bit.</p>
<p>&hellip;uhh&hellip;I have used iOS,android ICS,JB,Playbook OS&hellip;iOS sucks on keyboard bad keyboard+small screen,android very bad keyboard but the new one is better but it&rsquo;s Only better.When i got Dev Alpha and the keyboard just changed my attention to BB.I mean the keyboard with swipe up predictions and all&hellip;When BB10 releases the keyboard WILL BE THE BEST among touch devices,it&rsquo;s so good that qwerty phone fans would buy all touch.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>This &#8220;<em>Oh, you like a product made or powered by a company other than Apple or Google? You must be a paid shill</em>&#8221; crap needs to stop.</p>
<p>How long has RIM been paying you to throw people off their trail?</p>
<p>Some dude in the states is already camping out&#8230; He doesn&#8217;t even the the actual release date.</p>
<p><a href="http://blackberryempire.com/video-blackberry-user-camps-out-for-blackberry-10/blackberry-10-camp-out/" target="_blank">http://blackberryempire.com/video-blackberry-user-camps-out-for-blackberry-10/blackberry-10-camp-out/</a></p>
<p>Well, if it&#8217;s not Apple or Google, buying from other OEMs it&#8217;s a lost bet. Even though I love Android, I must admit this duopoly is not ideal. But it exists for a reason: Apple came up with something <strong>mind blowing</strong> when they launched the iphone. Google was the first to catch up with a comparable alternative, and everyone else lost. The only way the smartphone landscape can change is by introducing, again, something mind-blowing. Up until now neither RIM or Microsoft have come up with something among those lines. Sure Windows Phone is OK (as are iOS and Android), BB10 looks like it will be OK, but it&#8217;s too late. Even if they were objectively &#8220;better&#8221; than iOS or Android, they are too late, and the only thing that can save them is a breakthrough device-ecosystem. This is not a breakthrough it&#8217;s just another good runner who got too late to the start line and the race started 6 years ago.</p>
<p>you&rsquo;re confusing, you say  someone has to introduce something mind-blowing and yet u say RIM is too late, so we shouldn&rsquo;t get nothing new anymore and be stuck with these two and let them upgrade us w/ new features when they are ready correct?? Your saying positive things and writing it off before the sentence is done lol, your look at a developer build of the OS. The QNX RTOS will give them more of an &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; than any other OS out right now see the QNX Bentley Car 2 platform. They have partnerships for music, movies, tv shows, etc, multiple cloud services are deeply integrated into the os, and apps are here and coming.</p>
<p>Sorry I though it was clear enough:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to disrupt the duopoly you need something mind-blowing</li>
	<li>BB10 doesn&rsquo;t look mind-blowing. It looks ok.</li>
	<li>Even if it was better than iOS or Android it won&rsquo;t succeed: The market has already made its choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>They have? then BB should&#8217;ve died last year and this shouldn&#8217;t be launching on the 30th&#8230; but if you check around on twitter and in these articles people are ready/willing to switch from iOS and android to BB10</p>
<p>Personally I think that yes, BB should have died last year, or at least try to recover by making android devices.<br />
I sincerely hope for the people working at RIM that they find a large customer base in developed countries. But a more realistic side of me thinks that this won&#8217;t happen for the reasons already exposed (I don&#8217;t think comments in articles and tweets are a good way to measure how many will buy a BB device).</p>
<p>No it doesn&#8217;t, but it shows your point of everyone riding with iOS and Android till the wheels fall off is wrong, that&#8217;s whats realistic</p>
<p>If he worked for RIM he would be getting one for free anyways, so this will be his next device by default.</p>
<blockquote>I didn’t think that I would need to camp out in front of the store to get one on launch day, but with features like this and publicity like this, I may need to wake up early.</blockquote>
<p>Not sure if serious or&#8230;</p>
<p>It just might happen. There is pent-up demand, like when Apple finally dropped an LTE device.</p>
<p>I think you mean &#8220;when Apple finally released ever iPhone/iPad device, ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pretty sure their stock is dropping because demand for that phone turned out to be much lower than expected. Or so I read everywhere.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the supply chain adjustments were something else. Regardless, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worthwhile to compare RIM&#8217;s and Apple&#8217;s performance at this stage of the game, they are in different leagues now. RIM needs to worry about keeping and maintaining its strengths and market share.</p>
<p>As someone who struggled through a painful Blackberry Storm ownership, let me say that the company has been doing touchscreens for years, and has consistently done a worse job than the competition. I see no reason to think this experience will be much different.</p>
<p>The storm was awful.. I wanted that phone so badly and then hated it even more.</p>
<p>Nice try&#8230; QNX is a all new OS. I guess you haven&#8217;t used the PlayBook. BlackBerry 10 doesn&#8217;t share a single code with the old BlackBerry OS. Completly new from the groud up based on QXN kernel which is in millions of cars, robots and even the space shuttle.</p>
<p>But that doesnt mean the touchscreen will be any good or that the phone wont lag and need battery removals like every other black berry when it freezes</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the benefits of QNX like the car and shuttle thing before, is that really the sales pitch that will be used for these devices. In what way does that benefit buyers of BB10? I&rsquo;m honestly curious.</p>
<p>I would guess just that it can be a reliable and stable OS.  As said, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean anything for the phone OS, but just look at all the jokes about WP relating to BSOD and &ldquo;typical Windows reliability&rdquo;.  Whether relevant or not, the public build a perception about this kind of thing that might guide their buying decisions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a sales pitch. QNX has been out in the world for 20? years and runs on all sorts of devices. It is VERY stable, secure and refined. It has to be to run on medical devices, cars, shuttles, etc. It is a pretty awesome operating system.</p>
<p>One thing people are forgetting is that RIM hasn&rsquo;t had to work on the OS much at all. RIM decided the hardware specs and would have had to write the drivers for QNX but in general QNX would work without any problems. Instead RIM has been spending time making sure their apps ON TOP OF QNX are polished.</p>
<p>The benefit of QNX for BB10? It is small, fast and stable.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what you think I was &lsquo;trying&rsquo; but I expressed how much my Storm sucked. It did.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited about BB10 and would gladly give up this android in a second.</p>
<p>Completely sad but invalid point. This phone has nothing in common with any Storm or Torch ever released. The OS here is entirely new and built from the ground up.</p>
<p>Wow, so a person who had a bad experience with RIM expresses their distrust of the company&#8217;s abilities with touchscreens and you respond that it&#8217;s invalid and sad. This is the type of attitude that got RIM to the bottom of the pit its in now.</p>
<p>Considering the company has built a new device based on a completed new OS that shares nothing in code with that old device, he has a point, Apples to Oranges as you might say.</p>
<p>The company has also changed personnel from engineers to marketing to CEO, CMO, COO, etc.</p>
<p>Yeah, wow, when you see this kind of vitriol coming out of nowhere, it makes you question where such defensiveness could come from. Who cares if they rewrote their OS, did anyone say they didn&#8217;t? It&#8217;s the same company, the same brand, and that brand was sullied by a series of terrible products.</p>
<p>Why would I think they&#8217;d do any better this time, considering this is the company that thought the Storm was a brilliant device that would save them? The company that thought making users push the screen in for every character was somehow a better typing experience? Because they&#8217;re using code that&#8217;s in the space shuttle? Talk about sad and invalid points.</p>
<p>I would argue &#8220;The same company&#8221; and &#8220;same brand&#8221; bit.  RIM of yore was helmed by the last two Co-CEO&#8217;s, Lazaradis and Basillie who, in their time, were excellent, they quickly became.  Crazy, I guess.  They made silly decisions, and held the company back.   They also didn&#8217;t re-write their OS, they bought a company and had them design a new OS.  QNX is used for the onboard system in lots of cars, nuclear power plants, twitter, facebook, and pretty much anywhere people want an OS that won&#8217;t fail.  It&#8217;s really nothing like Old RIM, which was a disaster.  I don&#8217;t think people are willing to give New RIM a chance.</p>
<p>Do you think Apple pre- Steve Jobs is the same after SJ lead Apple. Management is matters, and also all other factors significant to the industry.</p>
<p>Dude. By the time RIM launched the Storm, even the second one, there was absoluetly <strong>nothing</strong> to save.</p>
<p>The Storms were terrible products because of the mature software, which wasn&rsquo;t built for use on a touchscreen + too weak hardware to run it smoothly. That&rsquo;s all I have to say. In that video above you already see clearly that this phone has none of the weaknesses any Storm had.</p>
<p>Using the terrible Storm to write off the touchscreens of every other BB that came after it&#8230; real ignorance.</p>
<p>&#8230;especially considering the Storm&#8217;s screen wasn&#8217;t even capacitive.</p>
<p>It was capacitive, they added the Surepress for the clickthrough. One of the early versions of Opera Mini contained its own keyboard that didn&#8217;t require the press down &#8211; the experience was not that impressive in terms of typing accuracy.<br />
The Storm put me off Blackberry for life, or so I thought. If I weren&#8217;t after other features which I don&#8217;t think are in the Z10, this would be of interest. Hope they include a Suretype keyboard.</p>
<p>Noted.</p>
<p>But it still doesn&rsquo;t make logical sense to justify dissatisfaction with an entire brand because a single known bad product. Its like me saying the Lumia 800s screen is terrible because the N97 screen was terrible. The only people who unfortunately get away with such are the people who spend $600 on a poor Windows notebook then replace it with a $1000 MacBook and come to forums talking about how s**t Windows is</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you, I didn&rsquo;t think the Storm was bad &ndash; on its initial state, I genuinely loved it. When I first tried one, I thought it had the initial firmware that was a bit sluggish. When I got mine, a week or two later, it was much smoother. A couple of updates later, the phone was not actually being improved by the updates, and the impression that I was getting was that they had no idea what they were doing (media support had been consistent, the first update made WMA playback awkward &ndash; some would play, some wouldn&rsquo;t, the following update fixed that, but messed up MP4s in a similar fashion). I never could buy into 5.0, simply because it felt more like they were just renaming the OS to get away from the laughfest it seemed to have caused.<br />
I agree with you on the lack of logic in terms of dismissing an entire brand based on one bad product, despite the fact I am guilty of doing exactly that &ndash; I have, on occasion, wondered what would have happened if I had gone with my other options, the Xperia X1 or the Bold.</p>
<p>Haha.. that&rsquo;s hilarious. I didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;write&rsquo; anything off.. I said the Storm sucked. It did. I&rsquo;m personally excited by the idea of BB10.. but my storm sucked.</p>
<p>Touchscreen phone? sounds revolutionary! /s</p>
<p>*good touchscreen device</p>
<p>Fixed that for you.</p>
<p>look at the article title, now look at my comment. notice the similarity.</p>
<p>If you went with the old spice gag, you would have gotten mad internet points.</p>
<p>Exactly! Love the title. Touchscreen phone, what a novel concept.</p>
<p>And why yes, Chris Ziegler, if I get a telephone of said &#8220;touchscreen&#8221; variety, why not one these Blackberry thingamajigs.</p>
<p>@Chris  They are <strong>austrian </strong>and <strong>not german</strong>. :)</p>
<p>Whoops, should&#8217;ve looked at the TLD. :) Thanks!</p>
<p>You&#8217;re welcome</p>
<p>totally irrelevant question, do you have German roots? just curious ..</p>
<p>Yes. I was born in Germany. Although my parents are from the Ex Soviet Union(Ukraine and Moldavia). My family name has polish roots.</p>
<p>Think he asked Chris, presumably because of the surname.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you mean Herr Zeigler?</p>
<p>Jawohl!</p>
<p>Haha&#8230;.I think you&#8217;re right :-$  Bitte entschuldigen sie mich :o)</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but between the guy&#8217;s voice and the size of his hands, this video may have came straight from Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen we have a winner. :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you mean &#8220;wiener&#8221; (as in Wien = Vienna)</p>
<p>actually the talking speed is a clear givaway &#8211; Austrian German is still single core.</p>
<p>The guy says he got it from a trusted source in northern europe and that the stickers do cover the serial number. He did that before with Note2. Someone at a skandinavian Operator has a Schnitzel Flatrate now</p>
<p>Get into tha&#8217; choppah&#8217;!</p>
<p>yes, it looks quite nice, from the video I see  they took inspiration from iOS and Android, the question remanins, why would I choose this over the other players?</p>
<p>Players you likely have already sunk considerable money and time and familiarity into in terms of ecosystem etc.</p>
<p>I also spend much more considerable resources on my car and nothing is tying me to it. When I’m in the market for a new one, I will see what is best for me at the time and buy that one regardless of what I had before.</p>
<p>Like always there will be those that are loyal until the end and feel they are invested in an ecosystem, but I keep seeing this argument that people will not switch because there is this manufactured loyalty which has never really worked in the past and I don&#8217;t see why it will magically transpire in the future.</p>
<p>I can tell you right now, my transition from Android to iOS was painful.</p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p>If this pain is real for the average user and is a big issue,  it is a problem to be solved.  by someone that wants to make money.  $4.99 app that imports everything and it&#8217;s painless.  Do you code?  C.R.E.A.M dolla, dolla bill y&#8217;all&#8230;..</p>
<p>I wish!<br />
No, as a gmail user since day one, and then a Droid 2 user for 3.5 years or so, I was really into google&#8217;s ecosystem. Mail, calendar, docs, drive etc.<br />
Then, when I moved (because I got a real job that gave us a phone we had to use) to an iPhone5, life was hard. Besides the simple issue of having to rebuy apps and find replacements for apps that did not exist on iOS (less of an issue than for those that go the other way, iOS to Android), iOS lacks an Accounts section like Android. Well, it does,  but it consists of Facebook and Twitter. This means that for every google app I bought, I had to manually sign in. For every app or service that uses my google sign in, I had to sign in manually. It really sucked. <br />
Add to that having to give up on the app&#8217;synergies&#8217; that I had grown used to, it was painful.</p>
<p>And to be clear, it&#8217;s not unique to Android to iOS, I&#8217;m sure the same can be said for those who transition from iOS to Android, albeit for different reasons.</p>
<p>you will need to use the BB10 device to realize how different it is compared to Android or an IOS, so far what I have seen and experienced on dev alpha device the app synergies, the PIM apps, smoothness and transitions from one app to another app and finally the gestures simply rock and believe me it is like taking the Android or IOS UX whole next level. It is so much better that it will blow your socks off once you starting using it.</p>
<p>iOS and Android? Nah, it looks straight from MeeGo Harmattan. IMO.</p>
<p>THIS</p>
<p>yes, probably, but again,  like WP8, they need to make the ecosystem work, somehow I don&#8217;t see them surviving with just a/or business oriented approach.</p>
<p>They wont, they are building an ecosystem via partnerships with other providers such as 7 Digital for media, who have a bigger collection than iTunes or Google Play, Box and Dropbox for cloud storage, etc.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re outsourcing these services instead of building their own?</p>
<p>That&#8217;ll be a no. For the forseeable future, I&#8217;ll only be buying Nexus phones.</p>
<p>*foreseeable</p>
<p>Maybe, you need a better touch keyboard. ;)</p>
<p>Who says he&#8217;s on a phone?</p>
<p>Same here. But the Ubuntu phone and Jolla phone both do intrigue me.</p>
<p>I like pull down to sleep. I&#8217;d rather that than some sort of notification center since I don&#8217;t use them anyway. It&#8217;s actually like pulling a shade down over the screen.</p>
<p>Its a pretty sleek&#8230; TAT has done a good job with the little little UI touches,. When you pull down the screen it actually goes into Bedside mode which is customizable. You can set it to only receive calls from individual person, or different apps like only receive BBM or work emails.</p>
<p>Agreed that it does seem more intuitive, but I thought the current &#8220;complex&#8221; unlock themes were always an artifact of trying to prevent pocket activation. If that&#8217;s the case, not sure how they got around that issue.</p>
<p>It seems very SMALL, unless the user has large hands. I&#8217;m not sure I want a phone that small.</p>
<p>4.3&quot;<br />
He does have huge hands. LOL</p>
<p><img src="http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/50e59c986bb3f7373100000e-1024-768-600-/img-20130103-00139.jpg" /></p>
<p>Well &#8211; now I&#8217;m disappointed. I was excited to have another option for not-gigantic-top-of-the-line phones.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a 4, not a 5, in the picture, so it&#8217;s not as big as you might think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve felt the Dev Alpha B in hand, and I can definitely say that the device is also very, very thin.</p>
<p>What are you talking about? 4.3&quot; is pretty much perfect!</p>
<p>Wow they look similar&#8230; I&#8217;d still take a Z10 over an iPhone.</p>
<p>Holy shit. Is that guy like 3 meters tall or what? From the video, the phone looked just a bit bigger than a HP Veer.</p>
<p>Yep, they copied it quite a bit. Good luck with the Apple legal department RIM.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a challenge: Please describe in words which elements of this phone copy the iPhone design without mentioning elements which also describe the LG Prada phone which was announced  in 2006 before the original iPhone, go!</p>
<p> <a href="http://phoneblip.com/upload/2006/12/lg_ke850.jpg" target="_blank">http://phoneblip.com/upload/2006/12/lg_ke850.jpg</a></p>
<p>The design of this phone already leaked in January 2012 and was inspired by another BlackBerry 10 design concept which leaked in November 2011. You know when the first iPhone 5 images and housings leaked? Right: in July 2012. That&rsquo;s half a year after this design here was chosen.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lojul1hoB91qgzuxc.jpg" /><br />
Good lord, man. It&#8217;s freaking Shaq. I mean WOW.</p>
<p>I thought the same thing from the image haha. Still, it looks quite promising.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 4.3&quot;, a few years ago that would be considered a massive phone. Personally I&#8217;m glad they made the choice to keep the screen a reasonable size.</p>
<p>4.2&quot;.</p>
<p>Yes this is my next phone.  GIANT hands on that dude.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only room for 3. You&#8217;d better ship fast, RIM!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not an arbitrary number or anything&#8230;</p>
<p>it is arbitrary, but it is also a pretty good unspoken rule&#8230;</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>You cannot take a rather immature market and make such statements, ESPECIALLY in tech where things move so fast.</p>
<p>ALL NEW INDUSTRIES START OUT WITH A FEW MAJOR PLAYERS</p>
<p>There is no rule, law, etc that says there can be three players. Hell, right now we have iOS/Symbian/Android/Blackberry/Windows that can ALL be considered major forces in the market.</p>
<p>Notice I said the  market, not the media or tech blogs etc. The current market has four major players fighting. I think it&#8217;s not that the market that can&#8217;t support more than three players, it&#8217;s our short freaking attention span&#8230;</p>
<p>To make another point, the market is even more fragmented when you look at it by manufacturer and not by OS.  Apple/Blackberry/Google/LG/Motorola/Nokia/HTC/Lenovo/Sony/Samsung/ZTE/Huawei/etc/etc</p>
<p>And price agressively&#8230;</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about this presentation is that there is no German translation for &#8220;Task manager&#8221;.. The phone itself is SOOOOO similar to Windows Phone that it makes it unimpressive for me. If I were a Blackberry person or fan I might lose my shit over the evolution of this device.</p>
<p>But because things like Jelly Bean and IOS exist its not that intersting.</p>
<p>Because things like Jelly Bean and iOS exsist is what makes it very interesting&#8230; Something different and new</p>
<p>Its not different that&#8217;s the problem.</p>
<p>Everytime I read dumb shit like this I ask myself why the heck do people only look at the visual surface to judge an OS? So Ubuntu is great (because it <strong>looks</strong> great) while being horrible to use and when people see the icon grid in BB10 they think &ldquo;= iOS/Android&rdquo;, when they see the Active Frames they think &ldquo;=Widgets/Live Tiles&rdquo; and when they see the HUB they think &ldquo;=Notification Center like iOS/Android&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s horribly dumb. I&rsquo;ll tell you the difference.</p>
<p>At iOS, Android and Windows Phone, the <strong>homescreen is the center</strong> of the whole system and the user experience. It&rsquo;s all about the homescreen. In Android you can place shortcuts and widgets there, in iOS it&rsquo;s just an icon grid, in Windows Phone you can place Live Tiles there, which can show dynamic information. The homescreen with shortcuts, widgets, Live Tiles and app launchers is a personalized place from where you take your action and to which you&rsquo;re brought back if you press a homebutton (which all three have in common). The notification center is just a global shortcut staff function to redirect you to the respective other app from whereever you are. The taskswitcher is also a staff function and I bet many people don&rsquo;t even use it and just go over the homebutton, because it&rsquo;s easier for them.</p>
<p>So what RIM did with BB10 is turning the tables here. They degraded the homescreen (which used to be the center and which is in BB10s case the app drawer) to a staff function and on the othe side turned the taskswitcher from a staff function into a multitasking screen, which is now the new center of your actions. You can even say the multitasking screen with its Active Frames is the new homescreen. The system is supposed to run up to 8 apps at any time, that&rsquo;s why they packed 2 GB of RAM in there. If you open a 9th app, the 8th gets closed automatically, all 8 apps are sorted by recency. The clue behind this is that the user doesn&rsquo;t have to care about which app is open and which is not. He just starts the app he needs and doesn&rsquo;t ever have to close it. This is thought-through very well. First thing is that a limited number of 8 apps saves resources and therefore battery. Second thing is that a limited number of 8 apps will never get confusing (think of having 16 open apps. By time you won&rsquo;t be able to remember all that are open anymore, 4 vertical scrollable pages with 4 Active Frames are too much to search quickly through and in the end you will end up launching each app new from the app drawer that doesn&rsquo;t sit on the first page of the multitasking screen). Third and final thing is that it&rsquo;s very likely that most users spend most of their time with a very limited number of apps on a daily basis. Let&rsquo;s say the browser, a certain messaging service, dropbox, Twitter and Facebook or whatever. In conclusion it means that all apps that you&rsquo;re frequently using are always up and running. And the more frequent you use them, the easier they are to access within the multitasking screen. That&rsquo;s why the app drawer (which is the center iOS) becomes a staff function: you will access it very seldom, because you only need it if you want to use an app that isn&rsquo;t already running.</p>
<p>Now on Active Frames: these are open and running apps and the biggest difference to Android widgets and WP Live Tiles is, that you don&rsquo;t pin them to a certain place, where they stick. As Live Tiles they&rsquo;re supposed to show dynamic live content from inside the app. But being on a multitaksing screen here and not on a customizable homescreen like in WP or Android means, that only those &lsquo;Live Tiles&rsquo; are shown you&rsquo;re actually really using and not ones of which you <strong>thought</strong> you&rsquo;re going to use them in the future. So in BB10 the multitasking screen, which is the center, automatically adapts to your user behavior, you don&rsquo;t have to anticipate your priorities. It&rsquo;s automatically a mirror of your user behavior and you don&rsquo;t have to care about any customization of it, it automatically happens as you start using the device. One might assume that therefore BB10 must be the most intuitive OS of all time.</p>
<p>And the HUB. It&rsquo;s not a notification center which redirects you to other apps, but a global messaging center from which you can compose and respond communications directly, without leaving the actual running app at all. Same goes for the peek feature. Peeking into the inbox while actually using any app through a simple gesture from the bottom of the device is indeed as freaking natural as checking the time on your wrist watch. It&rsquo;s just natural and convenient like hell.</p>
<p>And I bet that anyone who gets finally introduced to it and its 4 basic gestures and spends some hands-on time will be blown away. I think you see that an OS which contains an icon grid to launch apps isn&rsquo;t automatically &lsquo;the same&rsquo; as anything else also using an icon grid somewhere within the OS.</p>
<p>What do you think is new??</p>
<p>I might have missed somthing I guess, that video WAS of Android and iOS, not something different and new?</p>
<p>Ohh relax. Just a question on your opinion not a trolling inquisition. The OS is just a combination of IOS, WebOS and Android. There is no compelling reason to leave either OS. It s race for the bottom.</p>
<p>LIke I said if I were a Blackberry person I would be stoked but its not compelling. Ubuntu Phone is more original in style since you are mentioning that.</p>
<p>Haha, if you go back up in this little comment thread of ours, you will see that i was calm&#8230; your snide comment, &#8220;Its not different that’s the problem&#8221; promptly saying there is no difference at all between this and Android/iOS was the only un-calm comment haha.</p>
<p>Theres more to phone than just the UI. Even after all this time S60 is still one the most powerful OS&#8217;s around.</p>
<p>Oh the topic of Ubuntu, How is that any more original than BB10 and let&rsquo;s throw in Sailfish by Jolla.</p>
<p>Both have very similar ways of gesturing but if anything RIM&rsquo;s UI is at stage where it&rsquo;s almost out now for retail. You don&rsquo;t consider the whole flow and peek at all intuitive and how the interaction between apps and the hub is just a swipe a way where in the case of iOS, its more a clunky jump in/out approach. One could say these latest OS have in common is that they&rsquo;re all built with HTML 5 in mind where it shares their traits with WebOS.</p>
<p>even the grid of icons for RIM&rsquo;s OS takes a step back from the clutter that is Android and the main screen that occupies the simple iOS structure.</p>
<p>Right&#8230; I guess we all saw a different video.</p>
<p>Very heavy on the gesture side of the house, only  phone I have seen to impletment gestures well&#8230; other than the Ubuntu phone. I didn&#8217;t thing Android and iOS used a lot of gestures, I could be wrong though&#8230;</p>
<p>You are.</p>
<p>Really, so other than swiping left to right to move homescreens and down for the notifaction drawer&#8230; what other gestures are impletmented well in Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Dont get me wrong, i have been a devote Android user from day 1&#8230; But this is for sure different.</p>
<p>There is no good translation &#8211; Even in Windows, the Task-Manager gets called this way in the german version. &#8220;Prozessmanager&#8221; seems to be the closed one, although manager isn&#8217;t very german either.,</p>
<p>Prozessverwalter ;)</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t see any significant similarity between this and iOS, Android and especially WP. It think you didn&#8217;t anything in the video.</p>
<p>Nothing like WP.</p>
<p>Absolutely nothing like Windows Phone.</p>
<p>seems a bit confusing.  I mean noting unlearnable of course&#8230;but there are a LOT of gestures and hidden pull downs.</p>
<p>There are 4 basic gestures. I love the fact just like on they PlayBook u can swipe from the any side to half the screen to wake it up. Gestures will take 5 mins to learn but once u get used to it u won&#8217;t go back. I use my PlayBook and then my iPhone 5 I find my self swiping up to go back to the home screen lol.</p>
<p>ha i find i do that after using Windows RT for a bit.   Yeah everything can be learned&#8230;but always must be mindful for people who refuse to learn things (aka the average consumer)</p>
<p>A lot better than Windows RT, though.</p>
<p>um ok.</p>
<p>Indeed, and probably better than BeOS /s</p>
<p>Because Microsoft sucks, right?</p>
<p>Looks pretty solid, but not a revolution at all. Very gesture-heavy, which could mean that it is hard to learn for the average joe. Most people I know do not know the multifinger gestures on their ipad, not even the taskswitcher on the bottom. They usually switch apps via homescreen :D</p>
<p>I think single finger gesture like these are a bit more natural&#8230;</p>
<p>The touchgestures look awesome!</p>
<p>Did someone hit it with a shrink ray?</p>
<p>Looks nice, I like it that active app can be resized in such a way that we can see what&#8217;s behind. It&#8217;s just icons-in-grid view is so boring. Also I hope BB 10 provides better API&#8217;s for developers to make high quality apps on top. We&#8217;ll see&#8230;.</p>
<p>Boring but highly functional and intuitive, that&#8217;s all what it needs.</p>
<p>BB10 seems to make up for its mediocre design elements (font choice, use of gradients, etc.) with an extremely intuitive user interface. I&#8217;m okay with that I think. Generally BlackBerry devices have allowed you to change things like the system font and icons in the past, correct?</p>
<p>Yes even older BlackBerry you were able to change font and stuff. BB had themes long before Android as well. I don&#8217;t think BB10 will allow theme it doesn&#8217;t make sense.. It&#8217;ll interfere with the UI experience.</p>
<p>Changing fonts, colors, and icons should interfere with the interface though.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be able to change fonts and clours. There was even leaked pictures of a Black and White theme for the apps. Black theme will consume less battery.</p>
<p>With the old BlackBerry OS you were able to customize it with Themse. For example there were themse to make the phone look and act like iOS launcher, Windows Phone launcher etc.</p>
<blockquote>Black theme will consume less battery.</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s an OLED display?</p>
<p>LCD</p>
<p>So, unless you are doing local dimming or something, black isn&rsquo;t going to use less battery. The backlight is always on regardless of whether or not the pixel is on or not.</p>
<p>God, those fonts. It&#8217;s the one thing I can&#8217;t stand about this.</p>
<p>God, those fonts. It&#8217;s the one thing I can&#8217;t stand about this.</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>My friend with a Dev Alpha B says you will be able to change fonts and load themes but all they&#8217;ll do is change colours, icons, fonts and wallpapers. BB Hub icons won&#8217;t change and the device gestures are baked in so every app is forced to play ball with the user-experience. I think this is the way to go. First Palm did this, then Meego, then Tizen, then MS, and now BB.</p>
<p>Looks pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Pretty impressed. Good job RIM!!</p>
<p>Now use this on your BB 10 commercials and go knock some heads.</p>

<p>Sweet sweet tune from the old block.  LL before his soul was flushed down the loo and lost his gangsta boogie.</p>
<p>Yup this will be My Next Phone. I was going to for the QWERTY X10 but I&#8217;m going to for the Z10 larger screen. My iPhone 5 is good but iOS is boring and stale. Can&#8217;t wait to switch this.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to get this&#8230;..</p>
<p>As iPhone 5 owner I say this looks pretty great!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a BB die hard since &#8217;08 when I got my Bold 9000 until summer 2012 when I jumped ship and bought a Galaxy S3.</p>
<p>However I am still BB supporter and am excited to see the conversation has turned positive for RIM/BlackBerry.</p>
<p>So no, this is not my next but I hope it&#8217;s yours!</p>
<p>Android &gt; BB 10 &gt; WP8 &gt; iOS7</p>
<p>Looks like you already got a sneak peek at iOS 7. lol</p>
<p>Well if iOS7 is anything like each previous version of iOS has been&#8230; we kind of do have a sneak peak.</p>
<p>iPhone should lose the home button.. this coming from an iPhone 5 user. Double click to do this, triple click to do another thing, single click to something else and hold to do something else. Its not intuitive at all. Yeh its simple to use but so annoying at the same time. Gesture based OS is the future… and BlackBerry 10 looks good.</p>
<p>agreed</p>
<p>Physical buttons are much easier for the average user to understand and the home button hasn&#8217;t prevented Apple from implementing gestures in iOS. The iPad supports a number of them, they just haven&#8217;t implemented them on the iPhone yet because the gestures they used on the iPad son&#8217;t work well on a phone.</p>
<p>Ideally you should have both. Pure gesture based operating systems have a steep learning curve and many users simply don&#8217;t stick around long enough to learn them. Hopefully BB10 is simple enough for the average user.</p>
<p>The ipad supports 3 and the only semi intuitive one is swiping between apps.</p>
<p>The ipad supports 3 and the only semi intuitive one is swiping between apps.</p>
<p>You need 4 basic gestures for the whole OS and you get introduced to them during the first start-up, replay available or course. I don&#8217;t call that a learning-curve at all. It&#8217;ll be a no-brainer immediately.</p>
<p>Apple was fine putting a bunch o&#8217;gestures on their laptops and didn&#8217;t figure it was too complicated for the average&#8230;..</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a difference. In the case of the mac, gestures are an optional enhancement. If you know how to use them great. If not, you can still navigate the OS. New macs that ship put icons for things like dashboard and mission control in the dock, despite having gestures available for them. Windows 8 should have kept the start button for the same reason.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t count Jony Ive out.</p>
<p>When was the last time Ive came out with a new design? He&#8217;s been having a very long holiday, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>
<p>I was talking about the software alone. Apple HAS to improve iOS and Ive leading the &#8220;Human Interaction&#8221; unit is the only hope for that.</p>
<p>What qualifies as new?</p>
<p>Ugly as hell. It&#8217;ll be all about the usability, how it plays media, how fast it is (notice the guy is going v e r y s l o w l y with every gesture), how the BROWSER is, whether copy and paste &#8211; ie a whole webpage &#8211; works properly, how many and how good the app, the list is endless. To the iPhone knockers, it&#8217;s the small details that go largely unnoticed that make the whole experience seamless and smooth. BB dev team do not have the experience or the resources. This will be full of holes on launch I&#8217;m willing to bet. Don&#8217;t kid yourselves, this company is toast.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just stupidly assuming things, without having checked on other leaked videos and stories about this phone. I give you an example: the browser on this phone already TOASTS the iPhone 5 and GS3 in beta-status, wether it&#8217;s compatibility or speed. Do some research.</p>
<p>He is right at cues the guy was doing a demo and the system crashed on him. He was in the camera app and crashed too. He was very quick to say not final software obviously but still you have to wonder is the software ready? Seems like they need every second til the 30th.</p>
<p>Speaking of small details&#8230; Just look how the night mode is being turned on and the notifications turned off in the movie above. It&#8217;s easy, fast and natural. The analogue clock is darker and &#8220;asleep&#8221; which is also one little detail.</p>
<p>On iOS on the other hand, I am getting tired of the Settings menu. I am tired of all the clicks and steps which I have to make to set an alarm or calendar appointment. Graphics-wise, the little details back in the days, now are heavy skeuomorphic useless gramophones while playing a podcast&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, direct comparsion with BB10, cause you&#8217;ve mentioned copy/paste&#8230;</p>
<p>How do we change apps on iPhone. Let&#8217; me make you remember the hell: You&#8217;re in one app, you select text, menu pops-up, you copy. Then you double click the home button, search for the previous opened app, open it, paste the text there. Then AGAIN you double click and search for the previous app to go back.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too early for him to make all encompassing changes across all iOS stuff. Maybe in iOS8.</p>
<p>Have you taken a look at iOS 7? Please tell me more about it.</p>
<p>Yeah, just look at iOS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6&#8230;.nothings changed.</p>
<p>/owned</p>
<p>Exactly, the differnce in each version of iOS are so small, we cann really make an damn good educated guess as to what iOS 7 will look like.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/13/2612736/ios-history-iphone-ipad" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/13/2612736/ios-history-iphone-ipad</a></p>
<p>Go ahead and read through that, then tell me you can&#8217;t possibly imagine whas iOS 7 will look like&#8230;</p>
<p>Because if you are educated and informed, you will know that for the first time in iOS history, the thing is not under the same guy&#8217;s supervision.</p>
<p>You honestly think that hes going to drascially change what iOS users are used to. Thats a key thing Apple adheres to, &#8220;it just works&#8221;. Drastically changing the OS does not just work and will piss off the masses of everyday, average phone users.</p>
<p>Sure it will be different, but overall&#8230; it will be more of the same.</p>
<p>Well, there was no significant changes (interface-wise) from BB OS v4 all the way to v7. And they&#8217;re making quite a leap with v10 now. So, who knows? Miracle (might) happen too in Apple ;)</p>
<p>I can do this too! WP8&gt;IOS7&gt;Android 4.1&gt;BB10</p>
<p>An OS at the top that doesn&#8217;t even have a notification center. How ridiculous.</p>
<p>BlackBerry HUB &gt; Android Noti-Center &gt; iOS Noti-Center &gt; WP nothing</p>
<p>Coming soon! How about RIM releasing the PlayBook without a e-mail client? OR how BB10 won&#8217;t have half as many intergrated products and services as the lowest-specced Windows Phone does..for free? How ridiculous, this 2012.</p>
<p>What integrated products and services are these since you got an early preview of the Jan 30th announcement</p>
<p>PlayBook was released in April 2011 and was running an entirely new platform whose kernel RIM bought in April 2010. One year of work on an entirely new OS buil on a kernel the existing engineers had no experience with. One year of work on a platform (PlayBook) vs 3 years of work (BB10). I absolutely don&#8217;t care about what happended in 2011, it&#8217;s Q1/2013.</p>
<p>BB10 has all products and services integrated (and DEEPLY integrated) the average consumer wants. By far not everyone cares about native MS OneNote or XBOX Live for example.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.bestofmicro.com/A/Y/368458/original/Windows-phone-installation-disc.jpg" /></p>
<p>Zing! Windows Phone&#8217;s black screen of death.</p>
<p>&#8230;if you try and flash software from the side</p>
<p>Happened to like one person? I could continue the childishness by posting all the ugly Android homescreens out there but I&#8217;ll end it here.</p>
<p>I thought that was proven to be fake.</p>
<p>It was. People out here are ridiculously mis-informed</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/windows-phone-8-delivers-uefi-boot-manager-error-message/">REAL</a></p>
<p>WM6&gt;Bada&gt;WP8&gt;iOS&gt;BB7&gt;Android&gt;WebOS&gt;Symbian^3&gt;BB10&gt;Meego&gt;Maemo</p>
<p>Yes you can do that, but you won&rsquo;t be convincing anyone with WP8&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Nice</p>
<p>the OS looks very neat and tight, I am really liking what I am seeing..also I like the hardware too &#8211; classic black design, a definite buy for me..</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been this excited about a phone since my orginal Nexus One. I have the iPhone 5 now but its days are numbered. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get my Z10 next month!</p>
<p>RIM PLEASE TAKE MY MONEY!!!</p>
<p>Woo hoo! 14th customer!</p>
<p>Death-frightened WP fanboys all over the place.</p>
<p>Good day to you too, fine gentleman.</p>
<p>Who said you had to be an adopter of a small platform to make slightly-hostile statements?</p>
<p>Looks like a lame Gingerbread skin.</p>
<p>And you look like a lame Chris Angel knock-0ff&#8230;</p>
<p>y u jelly?</p>
<p>Bahahaha!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>pwned lol</p>
<p>LOL</p>
<p>jeezus &#8211; the tears just wet my screen&#8230;.   dsjkashkjOTFL</p>
<p>No it doesn&#8217;t. Are you blind?</p>
<p>Looks pretty good.</p>
<p>Might not be able to buy the Z10 right away, but I&#8217;ll try BlackBerry 10 out on the PlayBook for a while anyway.</p>
<p>Needs a <em>third</em> sliding menu, just to fuck with usability a little more.</p>
<p>Design of the handset is plain, but okay some people will like it(former bb users)<br />
But the OS&#8230;no, BB is not a serious player. I don&#8217;t see anything that can be classified as unique in this devices. BBM-imessage, whatsapp, etc.</p>
<p>They surely need to improve their support for apps developers by providing better API&#8217;s. Let&#8217;s see how they done it in BB10 this time.</p>
<p>Seriously people, RIM has been pushing strong support for devs since the beginning of 2012!</p>
<p>A lot of people are saying RIM should do what they have been doing for a year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d want to know if this one sells more than the model with the keyboard. Everyone else has abandoned physical keyboards and with things like Swype, you can be as efficient on a software keyboard. Also, I wonder how all the gesturing will work on a traditional model (with a much smaller screen) i.e. will it be comfortable?</p>
<p>The phone looks good though, designed not quite there compared to the other guys but looks intuitive. Plus, it&#8217;ll have all the Android apps ported over.</p>
<p>ATM a physical KB over a virtual keyboard is better any day however you want to implement the virtual one &#8211; swype, auto correct&#8230; or whatever.  There is a reason you still type on and want a good keyboard when you sit at you desk to use your laptop or desktop.</p>
<p>The same can be said when you want to type out real content on your smartphone.  I&#8217;m not saying you can&#8217;t do the aforementioned on a touchscreen, just that you can do it better with a physical keyboard.  If you think otherwise, ditch all the physical keyboards in your life and only type using touchscreens and please report back on your productivity  after you do as I am curious on the results.</p>
<p>I want the keyboard version. (X10)</p>
<p>I got to say it looks pretty good for a none Android/iOS phone!!</p>
<p>Am I the only one who feels that that damned notification LED needs an epilepsy warning?</p>
<p>RIM, meet 2007. 2007, meet RIM.</p>
<p>Haha nice try troll.</p>
<p>Hello Windows Phone, I&#8217;m the Z10, sent from 2018 to show you how things should be like.</p>
<p>They guy who made the video stated in his article that the camera does a better job in low light than the iPhone 5 and Lumia 920.</p>
<p>Sure. Since RIM has so much experience with hardware of mobile cameras. I used to love my Blackberry curve&#8217;s images.</p>
<p>You doesn&#8217;t need to have experience with cameras at all to buil them into your phone.  They&#8217;re produced by someone else. The guy uploaded a test video recorded at night on YT, and it&#8217;s pretty impressing. Shitty Curve cameras give no guarantee on a shitty Z10 cam.</p>
<p>RIM never put a lot of effort into their cameras until now, even with the Bold 9900 it&rsquo;s been pretty decent too.</p>
<p>Man having been used to Windows Phone&#8217;s less-is-more design, this whole UI looks like an ugly mess to me just like any Android phone out there.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying! From what I see of BB10&#8217;s UI it still looks archaic it&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re some fancy gestures.</p>
<p>In terms of Windows Phone, less is mess I guess.</p>
<p>Just take those stupid Live Tiles. Pure eyecandy with absolutely no benefit for everyday use. Should I really have to search through all these different sized Tiles to gather information I get in BB10 for example at one glance in one place?</p>
<p>ORLY? You think live tiles have no benefit? You must be more visionary than MSFT&#8217;s start studded Windows Phone design team that has won a great deal of awards for a forward thinking UI. Why would the Verge staff crown WP as having the best homescreen in that case? (See the Windows Phone 8 OS review).</p>
<p>So if the WP8 homescreen in this innovative, forward-thinking and beneficial, how the hell can it happen that most people of The Verge staff still don&#8217;t rely on WP8 as their daily driver? Take the gallery Tile. It shows random photos from inside the app. Whats the benefit here? FB Tile. Shows a random new status update or message from one of my &gt; 100 friends. Whats the benefit here? When I want to read status update, I visit my entire FB feed and won&#8217;t search for a fkn little Tile to show me ONE RANDOM status at a time. CNN Tile. Shows the newest article headline. This would be only beneficial to read in case of really big events like 9/11. In every othe case I won&#8217;t head for a tiny Tile to gather news information. I open the app when I want to read the news. It&#8217;s just a waste of resources from my point of view and nothing you really benefit from in daily use cases.</p>
<p>Let my tell you how the human brain works. It&#8217;s constantly working on only taking those impressions to conscious that we should really care about. Irrelevant things have to be rejected. And exactly THAT happens to gallery-, Facebook- and CNN- Live Tiles when you fly over your homescreen in daily average use. From day three on you won&#8217;t recognize any Live Tile any more. And all Live Tiles that are messaging-related become completely useless as long as you have an OS with a central notification- and/or messaging spot like you have it in BB10, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Let me tell you how the human brain works&#8230;lol How much more condescending can you be? Once again you keep highlighting the apps that are eye candy and disregard the thousands of others that you get to know when you actually use the OS. And once again you&#8217;re trying to dictate the expereince of every user and are falling woefully short at it. Sure WP8 might fall short on the notification center, that and apps are the biggest legit detraction points and apps is the only one with the biggest cry.</p>
<p>Because no one makes a smartphone purchasing decision because of the homescreen.Sit down</p>
<p>So if the verge don&#8217;t use BB10 as there personal phone&#8217;s will you deem it a failure?</p>
<p>What?<br />
Have you even used Windows Phone outside of a store? They obviously don&#8217;t use it as daily drivers because of other shortcomings that they can&#8217;t  deal with as tech reviewers (Although 1 or two of them actually have Lumias as phones they double wield&#8212;See the What&#8217;s in My Bag series).<br />
The gallery or Pictures tile to be exact, is a shortcut that also happens to add interactivity to the homescreen. What do you want it to do? Show the news?<br />
The FB tile actally rotates through more thanone friend but obviously shows one at a time.  I have no idea what the heck is wrong with that when you can easily tap the tile or go to the people&#8217;s hub quiclky to see more updates. And if you actually cared about a group of people you obviously have created a group that allows you to see just their updates and not the rest of Facebook noise.<br />
The CNN tile updates with new info and what stupid tiny tile are you referring to? You&#8217;re talking about WP7? cause in WP8 you can resize to larger tiles which display more info.  Stop it with the tiny tiles! and get with the program (WP8). You won&#8217;t understand WP8 until you use it just like I did with BB7 to understand he sorry state it is in. And as a matter-of-fact WP8&#8217;s homescreen is less of a resource hog than Android&#8217;s widgets.<br />
In targetting the not-so-useful app tiles you overlooked the thousands of other useful ones that you get to discover when you actual USE WP8! Like the basketball and NFL Livescores and Alerts app that updates in real time right on the homescreen. Multiple games at a time. Or The QR code for websites and contacts that another person can easily scan with Bing QR function or the twitter apps that display latest mentions and messages and new followers, or the RSS app that lets you pin individual articles to your homescreen.</p>
<p>TommesJay&rsquo;s;</p>
<p>Most can&rsquo;t rely on Windows phone as their daily driver as Windows Phone doesn&rsquo;t have enough of the native apps that they want to use daily&hellip;<br />
This problem is compounded 10x with BB10&hellip;.</p>
<p>Except that BB10 can run Android apps too.</p>
<p>How on earth are they &#8217;&#8217;eye&#8217;&#8217; candy, with no benefit to every day use? Are you being serious, or just trying to troll and start shit w/ people? So I guess that would make something like iOS w/ static tiles even less beneficial?</p>
<p>&#8220;Eyecandy&#8221; for me is something that looks cool and pretty but lacks any real functional benefit.</p>
<p>Except live tiles do have a benefit: having snippets of information without requiring any app to be open.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used both BB10 (on my friend&rsquo;s Dev Alpha) and WP and there is a huge difference between Active Frames and Live Tiles. They&rsquo;re different paradigms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except live tiles do have a benefit: having snippets of information without requiring any app to be open&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, is that a benefit? Random snippets of information I don&rsquo;t care about 95% of the time which crowd my homescreen, distracting me from things I <strong>really</strong> care about?</p>
<p>Question is, why would you pin that to your Start Screen if you don&rsquo;t care about it? What&rsquo;s the point? I only pin what I need what I want and what should be there <i>for me</i>. It&rsquo;s not distracting in the same way notifications pop up in the status bar on Android. They flash and stuff but they&rsquo;re not there. They also don&rsquo;t distract you as the only time you see them are when you&rsquo;re on your Start Screen, when you&rsquo;re launching apps.</p>
<p>Pinning can also apply to anything within an app, such as a radio station, a document, some letter, a conversation, a group of contacts, etc. It&rsquo;s not limited to apps and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so powerful.</p>
<p>If only they were interactive &#8211; oh wait, we already have something like that called W&#8230;</p>
<p>So why not just tap on the tile? Do they have to be interactive? There&rsquo;s really not enough room within a Live Tile for interaction to give any real benefit to the OS.</p>
<p>On Android where the widgets stretch down and all around, that&rsquo;s pretty beneficial, in usefulness. Does take a bit of a hit to the speed on mid-range phones though.</p>
<p>So if icons that display relevant information about an app w/out opening it don&rsquo;t serve any real function, then what would you say about icons that don&rsquo;t do anything but launch the app? At first I was taking you seriously, but then after you posted this reply I remembered you were saying some utter nonsense about how blackberry was going to take over enterprise again by choice of end users (not force from IT departments) &ndash; your reasoning&hellip;&ldquo;it just will&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I understand what it&rsquo;s like to have faith for a platform that&rsquo;s the underdog. But when you say stuff that makes you sound kinda fringy (like live tiles have no functional benefit), you start to lose all credibility I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>
<p>By your reasoning, if live tiles lack any real functional benefit, then again I ask you again (hopefully I can get an answer), does that mean that iOS icons actual make the end user experience <strong>WORSE</strong>, since they actually have even less information?</p>
<p>No, they don&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference if I have live updates on my icons I won&rsquo;t ever look at or no live updates on my icons.</p>
<p>You know what I&rsquo;d do as a WP user? I would stretch exactly <strong>one</strong> Live Tile to the limit: Mail. And it would be right at the top. This might actually be a live update I can benefit from. All the rest I would resize to minimum, to pack as many of them in one spot as possible. And there you go: despite those Live Tile for Mail I have the same homescreen I have on iOS. Icons with little numbers for unread items attached to them. And still no notification center. Or I even go the BB10-way and have all notifications and unread items always at one swipe at one glance, without them filling my homescreen in form of Icons or Live Tiles.</p>
<p>How about, instead of saying what you &ldquo;would do&rdquo;, how about you try the platform or shut up.</p>
<p>If you have never used a WP as a daily driver then you can&rsquo;t comment on its functionality.</p>
<p>This is literally probably one of the most most retarded comments I&rsquo;ve read in a long time.</p>
<p>You say that the only thing in the world that <strong>you</strong> would care to get glanceable information from is mail, and everything else you personally wouldn&rsquo;t care about&hellip;therefore live tiles are functionally useless.</p>
<p>I knew you were a blackberry fanboy before, but you&rsquo;ve taken it to a whole &lsquo;nother level. You&rsquo;ve characterized your lack of need for something, not just as something that nobody else has a use for, but literally something that is beyond broken, you actually called it functionally useless. Move along man&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just plain wrong. Live tiles allow you to look at information without going into the app. It&rsquo;s very useful and it also causes no deterioration in battery life unlike widgets. They also make the homescreen alive.</p>
<p>BB10 offers Active Frames, which in reality are like minimized windows on a desktop computer This is only effective when the app is <i>open</i> and then there&rsquo;s a limit of 8 apps open. With Windows Phone, you can have updates from many apps at once. However, BB10 surpasses WP tenfold in multitasking.</p>
<p>UI wise though, BB10 is ugly compared to Windows Phone. There&rsquo;s a weird mixture of elements that seem to be inspired a bit by iOS. But how it remains to be seen on final hardware may change that decision. I for one thought the WP8 screen was butt ugly until I saw decent hardware for it. Then it was nice. BB&rsquo;s Z10 (in white) is actually quite the looker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it also causes no deterioration in battery life unlike widgets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell me how properly programmed widgets consume any more battery than live tiles? If anything static widgets (i.e. no animations unlike live tiles) should require more CPU to operate.</p>
<p>Widgets do not deteriorate battery life in any significant way.</p>
<p>Thing is, I don&rsquo;t see any benefit in randomly rotating single photos, FB status updates, news headlines and even sports scores SOMEWHERE on my full packed homescreen. I&rsquo;d also never use widgets in Android. You set them up because you  <strong>think</strong> you <strong>will</strong> always want to have weather information at <strong>this spot</strong>, but at the end of the day you won&rsquo;t consciously look at it anyway because most of the time you don&rsquo;t care about the weather. That&rsquo;s the good aspect of BB10 and its Active Frames: There are only those apps on the homescreen (which is the taskswitcher) you&rsquo;re actually using. So if it&rsquo;s saturday or sunday and my favorite team has a game and I open up ScoreMobile for example and the Active Frame shows dynamic live updated content on the game within my homescreen. As soon as the game is over I close it down and it won&rsquo;t waste any space and won&rsquo;t distract me from other things anymore. The apps and contents you use most often, are automatically in the right place on the homescreen. That&rsquo;s the deal for me. You say you can gather information wothout opening an app. Nice. So let&rsquo;s assume I want to check the status of a certain friend of mine. What now? I go to that homescreen, look for the FB tile and wait till the status of that friend appears? OMG.</p>
<p>You have serious problems&hellip;</p>
<p>I like how you throw out these hypothetical scenarios, that make no sense, and show that you have not really used the platform that you are criticizing.</p>
<p>See as someone who has used Widget&rsquo;s in WM and Tiles in WP I can tell you the benefit of such things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take your game day scenario: <br />
So it&rsquo;s Saturday and you want to know what the scores are. So you have to open the app/browser look at the score. SO every weekend you have to take time to launch an app to look at the score, rather than having a tile towards the bottom of your home screen and just be able to scroll down. And since when do sports only occur during the weekend?</p>
<p>Oh and the weather, well as someone who lives in an area where the weather can shift by 10-20 during the course of a week, especially during this time of year, It is so nice to wake up and look at my phone and know what the weather is like at home and at work/school. Not have to open an app to check.</p>
<p>For sports: I&rsquo;m only interested in certain events. Let&rsquo;s take a Premier League football team, that also participates in Champions League. This team is only going to play two games a week at maximum, with a maximum of 105 minutes each. So shall I really set up a Live Tile that takes space on my homescreen that shows 210 minutes of info I care about during a week that has 10,080 minutes in total?</p>
<p>And now let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re into many kinds of sports, football, NHL, NBA, F1 and more und you want to be up to date. How likely is it that the Tile shows you the certain info you&rsquo;re searching for the moment you look at it? I can just open a certain app for the time I need it and let it run in the background as long as I need it. That one start-up and shut down is no real effort to me. Not to mention that ScoreMobile for example has a fav-function. You mark a team as favorite and get a notification when a game starts and at every event of interest.</p>
<p>Weather: I care about the weather during summer when I want to check if the weather is going to meet the requirements of an upcoming event, like a BBQ.</p>
<p>It seems that 97% of the smartphone buying public disagree with you, but you&#8217;re entitled to your opinion.</p>
<p>The gesture style is kinda fresh but seems more like smoke and mirrors to me.  I don&#8217;t see any of this as actually being more efficient than an Android implementation.  For instance, why should have I have to swipe down and left just to see if I have messages whereas with Android all I have to do is look at the status bar.  The one thing I will give them is the combined message inbox (but that&#8217;s nothing new).  For those sold out to BlackBerry it will be a well needed change but for most people on other platforms, smoke and mirrors aside its really nothing new.</p>
<p>Pretty neat but DOA. Seriously, does anyone think BB has any chances any more..</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been saying for months that RIM is dead and hanging by a thread.</p>
<p>This Z10 is turning out to be one hell of a fucking thread that they might be able to pull themselves up. I still say &#8220;might&#8221; because I have not seen it myself in person and it&#8217;s not Jan 30th just yet.</p>
<p>More than one thread then</p>
<p>It looks so friggin&#8217; tiny.  That just won&#8217;t do these days.</p>
<p>No, they guy&#8217;s hand is huge.</p>
<p>i kinda like it</p>
<p>Strangely enough, so do I.</p>
<p>It looks like a horribly skinned version of Android with some WebOS sprinkles on top.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that you&#8217;re not the only who says things like this, RIM should just go for a PRETTY, eyecandy and new GUI, without any functional sense, like Ubuntu for phone. Stupid people like you would definetely buy it then.</p>
<p>Your condescension is absolutely uneccessary. Ignoring the content of your reply entirely, the immature way you pose your opinion makes anything you might&rsquo;ve said not worth hearing. More importantly, you act as if people aren&rsquo;t entitled to think differently than you and still be valid in doing so. Leave the internet pl0x.</p>
<p>We are halfway through January and my anticipation for the 30th grows with each day.  Can&#8217;t wait for BB 10 to make a splash.  I will be getting the QWERTY model, but I want the Z10 to do quite well.  I already like BB10 more than iOS and Android (and yes I have used them both).  As long as there are certain concepts that are brought over from the old BB OS, I will be totally happy.  Bring BB 10 on!</p>
<p>I really like some of the ideas (the swiping gestures mostly), but seriously how can anyone say the UI looks nice? The Icons look terrible, somewhat lo-res and seem to follow no color-scheme whatsoever. Ok, the target group mainly consists of business people but I guess at least some of them wouldn&#8217;t mind a nicer looking UI&#8230; Reminds me of my dark SGS1-TouchWiz-laden days..<strong>shudder</strong></p>
<p>Those icons have 355 PPI.</p>
<p>Wow 355 dpi looking like 155. That&#8217;s an achievement</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you can judge it before you spent hands-on time. You didn&#8217;t see it in person.</p>
<p>Kid me not. It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s next touchscreen phone. Is that 3&quot; screen?</p>
<p>4.2&quot; screen. That guy has monstrous hands.</p>
<p>This is actually very good. Only thing that is left is not messing up the Keynote, launch it in as many countries as possible and get Developers working on this quickly. Frankly with the apps shown and few photo editing apps &#8211; i&#8217;d definitely get this.</p>
<p>The January 30 launch is actually happening as a simultaneous event in New York City, Dubai, Johannesburg, Toronto, Paris, and London. &#8211; American blogs failed to mention this.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s like getting into a maze !!</p>
<p>iOS and Android mixed together? Can&#8217;t fault it but no not my next OS or phone. RIM won&#8217;t survive the long run even with this new OS if they don&#8217;t market, top notch hardware and app support. Time will tell though.</p>
<p>While it seems like BB is too late to the market, I actually think their timing isn&#8217;t terrible.  I think they have a chance at success with some of the long time iPhone users who feel that it iOS is getting stale.  One thing BB always had going for it is that people felt real affinity for their phone &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t called a Crackberry for no reason.  Its still a long shot given how embedded iOS and Android are, but if the rollout is smooth I give them a decent chance at becoming a solid #3.</p>
<p>I agree. Most of my friends are on iPhone 4S and majority of them were BlackBerry users before they go the iPhone. Their contracts are up for renewal we are all waiting for BlackBerry 10 and give it a try.</p>
<p>This phone design is simple, quite tasteful. I could very well see it in dark violet or dark cherry red &#8211; with a matte finish in both cases.</p>
<p>The OS and phone surely deserves a full fledged review when they come out but I find it personally quite exciting. You recognize some of the Playbook&#8217;s UI paradigms clearly. On the PB you can switch between running apps from a thumbnail side by side sort of view &#8211; here it&#8217;s assembled as tiles &#8211; or you can dislodge the active fullscreen app and switch to another one fullsceen by peeking to the left and right. The gestures layout is quite easy and functional &#8211; that peeking, pushing an app to the background, etc. In the video I also saw a settings shortcuts pulldown menu that looks a lot like Jelly Bean&#8217;s. All objects in the UI seem to have lots of info and functions associated, and there&#8217;s lot of visual feedback. It also looks snappy. At first glance it seems they really did their homework and this looks like an original and unique hardware/software combo. Soon we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>I like the white one, but other colors like that could definitely work.</p>
<p><img src="http://berrythai.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/White-Blackberry-z10-vs-iphone-5-01.jpg" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s that one on the left? Is that just pretty render?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s the Dev Alpha.</p>
<p>Mayyybe not.</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty render,  but it&rsquo;s exactly alike what the leaked press shots show the device as.</p>
<p>Nice looking device.</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;I actually like the hardware&hellip;not convinced with the OS at all though.</p>
<p>I was always partial to BB hardware&hellip;</p>
<p>As someone who will probably need to manage BB10 at work, i&#8217;m already annoyed that I need to run it concurrently with our existing BES.</p>
<p>As per the device itself, the software looks intriguing and has some features that I like, for example the side bar shortcuts and the swiping predicted words into a message I&#8217;m typing.  The grid of static icons is seriously boring to me though.  I wish we could move on from that like Windows Phone 8 is doing.</p>
<p>Do you mean like WPs single column of static icons is better?</p>
<p>Looks good.  I wish &#8216;em well.<br />
It wont be my Next, because, well, I&#8217;ve just recently bought my Next.<br />
But no reason to hate on them because it&#8217;s not my personal choice.</p>
<p>I wish them well.  I think it looks like a cool phone that&#8217;ll be fun to own.<br />
Getting in on a new OS means for an interesting time for whoever chooses it.  You get to see the thing being born.  Go for it, if you are interested.  The worst that can happen is that it doesn&#8217;t work out an you buy another phone in a years time.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t Apple ever copy the flashing led for notifications? Was always blooming brilliant</p>
<p>too many notifications; too much flashing.</p>
<p>My sis-in-law uses an app or hack on her iphone for her led flash to notify her of incoming messages.  Quite an archaic and inefficient solution I must say and definitely more &#8220;flashy&#8221; on epilectic level.</p>
<p>1. What you&rsquo;re sister in-law is using is not a hack&hellip;.. it&rsquo;s a feature in the &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; menu for those who are deaf so they can SEE when they have notifications.</p>
<p>2. Having an LED notification light is fantastic for many situations, like being in a meeting. Usually the vibrate is off and you can just look at the light (and color of the light) to know what kind of messages you have waiting. Turning on your phone&rsquo;s screen is a instant notifier to anyone that you&rsquo;re not paying attention to them.</p>
<p>It maybe a feature for &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; reason, but it&rsquo;s an after thought and a &ldquo;hack&rdquo; for those that aren&rsquo;t deaf.  It works sure, but it&rsquo;s not the ideal solution.  The best implementation is the BB invented solution of a dedicated LED for notification that can be customized infinitely to your needs.  Flash rate, colour, light combinations, colour for particular contact or app&hellip;..  etc.</p>
<p>Not if you can set it to vm or text messages only. It would be very useful.</p>
<p>Given Jobs&#8217; control freak tendencies and obsession with Zen minimalist crap, the people who considered it probably thought better than to bring it up. Jobs&#8217; stranglehold on the &#8220;experience&#8221; is one of the major reasons why the UI elements look like they came from a 90s Palm PDA.</p>
<p>While this overall looks really nice, I can&#8217;t stand the look of the UI. It seems very boring.</p>
<p>Huh. That looks pretty decent, contrary to my general skepticism on this matter. It would be nice if they could turn things around and become a real player again.</p>
<p>Either the guy has huge hands of the phone seems pretty small.  I don&#8217;t see anything compelling from the video.  It just looked like another Android or iPhone with rows of icons.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get how someone could of watched this Video and came away with &#8220;Awesome!&#8221;  I could see where someone watched this and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see this as being my Next.</p>
<p>The icon grid on multiple pages is just a small piece here. It&#8217;s a standard that doesn&#8217;t have to be enhanced, people are used to it. What really counts, is the rest. And there is many. Just do some research on it. The icon grid is the most irrelevant piece of this OS.</p>
<p>Irrelevant?  It&rsquo;s what people see first when they use the OS.  Perception will be that BlackBerry looks like just another Android handset.  Although you assume in your comments that I haven&rsquo;t read up on the other features of the OS that apparanty &ldquo;Count&rdquo;.  I have read up on some of the other features of the new OS and some features are encouraging, but not groundbreaking, and definately not something typical users will consider when looking for a phone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perception will be that BlackBerry looks like just another Android handset</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the perception is that Andoid looks like iOS?</p>
<p>He has freaking huge hands. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he killed someone to get this device.</p>
<p>we need a sense of scale because that phone looks pretty small.</p>
<p>otherwise that guys has a giant&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>129 &#215; 65 &#215; 8 mm he claims, with a 4.2&quot; screen.</p>
<p>Yeah it looks REALLY small and it&#8217;s supposed to be 4.2 inches. Dude must have Hulk hands.</p>
<p>Its a surprisingly interesting UI experience. Might be looking at purchasing a z10 on the 30th if RIM can nail the features, keynote and rollout.</p>
<p>It will look even more attractive if google can&#8217;t get the nexus 4 back on the playstore.</p>
<p>A well doing Blackberry/RIM is a healthy competition for WP/MS. <br />
Like Android and iOS are.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not one among others to be disappointed with Blackberry releasing a great OS and device. Bring it on.</p>
<p>Man. Those real-time Youtube captions are pretty hilarious if you enable the translation.</p>
<p>Very promising. Im an Android user onVerizon and nothing on the horizon impresses me at all. Since I wont be able to get a nexus 4, I might have to jump ship. I like how this looks.</p>
<p>Ugly fonts, ugly icons, ugly OS.</p>
<p>i would take something functional over something pretty any day. I dont have time for BS distracting bling and colors. This is a smartphone not a kaleidoscope.</p>
<p>Why not pretty <em>and</em> functional?</p>
<p>Apparently italics don&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Free entertainment: watch video with the translated closed captioning beta.</p>
<p>I hear that german voice and I&#8217;m just expecting some crazy anal at any moment&#8230;</p>
<p>Pr0n expectations aside, I think it looks really good.  As a core OS.  The proof will, as always, be in uptake and dev support.  A lot of WebOS style features it seems.</p>
<p>The closer this gets to launch, the better it looks. I remember mocking the Florida BBJam convention where the OS was demoed because it was obvious that it was a pre-rendered video running on the demo phone and not the actual OS. I was sure they&#8217;d miss the January target (again).</p>
<p>Hopefully they&#8217;ll avoid the mistakes Palm made when they launched the Pre almost exactly 4 years ago.</p>
<p>One big mistake they will not make is launching a new phone that will make or break them and have no money in the bank.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy for people to forget that Palm was in debt, while RIMM has over 3 billion cash surplus.</p>
<p>I think they will sell well. Looks like an awesome phone + OS combination, placing an emphasis on features that really matter: Being a phone (that dials numbers), integrating different types of messages in the Hub, having business and private &#8220;modes&#8221;, quick access to important functions. To me, it looks like a phone built primarily for actual productivity. I cant wait for one of my friends to become an early BB10 adopter. If they really work well in the wild, I&#8217;ll actually consider getting one as my first ever BB handset. They have something interesting going here.</p>
<p>Panzerschreck!</p>
<p>Looks like a mashup of WebOS and Android to me.</p>
<p>Ok, yawn, yawn, seen all that before on other phone OS&#8217;s. It&#8217;s like they got a list of features from all the different OS&#8217;s and pulled a few from each. I can&#8217;t see this grabbing much market share from the top 3.</p>
<p>Die hard blackberry fans only.</p>
<p>Are you dumb? Blackberry is #3 os market share wise</p>
<p>Actually, Windows Phone is #3</p>
<p>ACTUALLY:</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://cdn.iphonehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Q3-2012-US-Smartphone-OS-market-share.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/2012/11/Android-Marketshare-At-75-Percent.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>Q3 2012</blockquote>
<p>Do you have access to Q4 numbers before they&rsquo;re compiled?  I think Q4 will suffice.  I doubt in 3 months WP overtook BB which is the point.  They&rsquo;re still #3.</p>
<p>Next time, don&rsquo;t be so bloody lazy in trying to refute my evidence and present some to show I am wrong.  All you did was write &ldquo;Q3 2012&rdquo;  which means nothing.</p>
<p>Yes I agree (about blackberry being #3 &ndash; not the other bit ;) ) but it is not going to be for long. It is heading in the wrong direction. WP is at least growing in market share.</p>
<p>Blinking red light is infuriating.</p>
<p>NOT THIS.</p>
<p>THIS: Iconic.</p>
<p>Is that an Asha Full Touch? No, just kidding :P</p>
<p>Even the Blackberry makes iPhone looks like its from the stone-age. ROFL</p>
<p>I honestly think BB10 Is my next. I&#8217;m just concerned with the app eco system.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that is an issue as they already have, at minimum, 15,000 apps already.  If you can get past that interface, then you&#8217;re in luck..</p>
<p>This phone looks good enough to earn BlackBerry the number 3 slot, and it&#8217;s a nice kick in the nuts to Windows Phone for sure.</p>
<p>Not hard to do :-)</p>
<p>Wow&#8230; That UX is a <strong>HOT MESS</strong>!  I understand <em>Android, iOS, Windows Phone</em>, even the UI on my work Blackberry Bold.. but this is just an amalgamation of too many OTHER&#8217;S UXs.</p>
<p>I like the hardware in that pic where it&rsquo;s white but I gotta agree with you&hellip;the OS is kind of a mess&hellip;<br />
I guess we&rsquo;ll see when the reviews come up&hellip;I expect some positive reviews from the blogs as RIM doesn&rsquo;t get the hate that Microsoft does but I think for the average consumer it&rsquo;s a bit much</p>
<p>This OS is absolutely easy and intuitive, only 4 basic gestures to &lsquo;learn&rsquo; and you&rsquo;re getting introduced to them during the first start-up.</p>
<p>Microsoffffft&#8230;beware?</p>
<p>I like it! I still hope it fails though.</p>
<p>Wow. Only understood about 10 words that guy said. Other than that, some aspects of the OS looks interesting e.g opening up the bb hub from the open apps page and the pull down/ up screen functions. Actually the pull down/ up screen functions was the coolest thing. <strong>I&rsquo;m not aware</strong> of any other phone OS has that</p>
<p>Other than that I see the apple and android influence which isn&rsquo;t anything new. Although I guess they can&rsquo;t go wrong taking that route.</p>
<p>I do wonder how easy it will be for some of their users to get familiar with BB10 though.</p>
<p>Hurray!!  A fresh and useful take on phone UI.  Android might have competition (in terms of power and usability&#8230; market share is another thing entirely, but at least they have a good base to build from).</p>
<p>Rectangle with rounded corners? Without the blackberry logo on the back, wouldn&rsquo;t this look too much like the backside of iphone5?</p>
<p>If they continue to make phones with physical keyboards, I&rsquo;ll be there.  Slab phones selling like crazy doesn&rsquo;t mean keyboard phones do not sell&mdash;they will all sell, just put them out there.</p>
<p>RIM! Pull me back in :-)</p>
<p>I need EAS mail, contacts, calendar, tasks and a functional dialer. No candy, whipped cream or jimmies. Moneyphone :-)</p>
<p>lame!</p>
<p>this looks SWEET!  as a Bold 9930 user this looks amazing and alot more fluid then the current BB7 and even Android and that old stale looking iOS.</p>
<p>Without Gmail apps is dead for me..No Youtube,Maps or Gmail.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Gmail built in, Google Talk built in, Youtube I&rsquo;m not so sure about (although BB10&rsquo;s browser is the best of any platform, desktop included, so running YouTube in the browser probably isn&rsquo;t so bad), and I think there&rsquo;s Maps. There&rsquo;s got to be maps.</p>
<p>Integrated TomTom with POIs, turn-by-turn and voice control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kamera&rdquo; :-)</p>
<p>P.S. Impressive! I&rsquo;d definitely consider bb10</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sold on it yet. They&rsquo;re seriously a long way behind at this point.</p>
<p>Behind what?</p>
<p>I still just feel like it&rsquo;s too little too late for RIM.  I&rsquo;d hate to see such a (formerly) venerable company collapse just yet, so I hope someone buys this thing, but I just don&rsquo;t see its success coming too easily.</p>
<p>looks like the menu and home screen are not separated</p>
<p>The taskswitcher will be the homescreen. You&rsquo;re supposed to run 8 apps at any time + the HUB to the left. This way you&rsquo;ll see the app drawer (menu) very seldom, because I think most people don&rsquo;t need more apps than 8 most of the time. The time you need a ninth app, number 8, which you&rsquo;ve not used for the longest time, will be kicked out.</p>
<p>that lock screen clock is SEXY.</p>
<p>Just when I thought there was no more room for new fanboys&hellip;</p>
<p>Honestly we need some more BB10 fanboys to promote some good discussion instead of one sided ridicule. This is the Verge, we&rsquo;re supposed to be celebrating new tech and new developments.</p>
<p>Looks fantastic.</p>
<p>Honestly, aside from the lock screen and gesture features, most people may find some difficulty in differentiating this interface from Android&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>EDIT: Doesn&rsquo;t look bad, though.</p>
<p>this isnt the final OS, differentiating stuff will be jan 30th.</p>
<p>there is an edit on the verge now?</p>
<p>On a somewhat unrelated note, does anyone else find it crazy how much of this video you can understand just knowing English? I know the languages are very close to each other, but dayum.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just going to predict that blackberry will stay in third place killing off windows phone for good.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for sure. And when Nokia&rsquo;s tribe heads will fire Elop and finally ditch WP for something better Microsoft will be definetely out of the game.</p>
<p>That device looks awfully nice. Now blackberry has to do something wonderful with the screen, the old bolds used to have fantastic screen n texture I really wanna see that magic in the new phones</p>
<p>The Dev Alpha and Dev Alpha B are really impressive in person. The Dev Alpha B is silky smooth, the screen is amazing as well. It pays to be friends with a dev :D.</p>
<p>I have an iphone 5 and it is truly a zenith in historical hardware design. But call me crazy the QNX intuitiveness in the Playbook seems to me a lot more natural then how I have to navigate iOS and this is after accounting for learner&rsquo;s curve bias. I am definitely getting a Blackberry. I prefer the physical keyboard but the Z10 comes first and it will be very very hard to resist based on feedback already.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if this one &gt; Nexus 4&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great phone and my next&hellip; the only problem I have with it, is if you put a &ldquo;protective cover&rdquo; on it, it interferes a lot with the swipe-from-the-edge gestures&hellip;</p>
<p>edit&hellip; just for the fun of it<br />
again&hellip;</p>
<p>I think BB10 is shaping up pretty nicely though the aesthetics still have that aged look to it similar to ios.</p>
<p>On a different note what the hell is up with the random WP hate in this comment thread?</p>
<p>Well from what I&#8217;ve seen in the video (and I do speak and understand German fluently), I think BB10 seems far too crammed. All those gestures in different directions aren&#8217;t self-explanatory, just my opinion. <br />
Of course, the guy presenting the device didn&#8217;t show how notifications are handled (he merely said something about how easy it is to see further info after something has come in).</p>
<p>If iOS managed to implement some handy gestures that feel more natural than the ones in BB10, I wouldn&#8217;t have any incentive to leave the platform. Although I admit that I use a JB for Zephyr and NCSettings on my iPhone 4 running iOS 6. With those tweaks, however, I&#8217;m more than satisfied with my phone, despite its age.</p>
<p>there are 4 gestures, up slightly to check notifications, up-right to open hub from anywhere in OS, slide up to minimize app, slide down to show menu &#8230;my mother doesnt even own a smartphone and i showed her how to work her playbook&#8230; ppl barely know about the gestures on their iPad</p>
<p>Dann solltest du die Artikel lesen die der Typ auf seiner Seite hat. Die sagen eigentlich alles. W&uuml;rde ich selbst BB10 nicht schon in-und auswendig kennen (von zahlreichen Videos und Artikeln), und w&uuml;rde dann obiges Video als Erstkontakt sehen, ich w&uuml;rde dasselbe denken. Ich denke wirklich du schaust dir die Gesten einmal an, probierst sie aus und schon fluppts.</p>
<p>Hey, what happed to all those <em>DIE RIM, BB fail, RIP, why are you bothering go home, I give them 6 months, they&#8217;re bankrupt, they&#8217;ll never beat Apple, just give up and use Android already</em> comments that filled up all these thread a year ago?  Let&#8217;s get some of that good old internet vitriol back!</p>
<p>Seriously though, I like what I see, and it&#8217;s refreshing to see some honest and positive feedback for once.  I wouldn&#8217;t make any grand statements about dropping iOS until actually playing with a device myself, but it looks promising and personally, the more diverse the space, and the more choices presented to the consumer the better.  iOS/Android/WP don&#8217;t need to &#8216;die&#8217; for BB10 to succeed.  I&#8217;m sure iOS and Android could survive quite well with 30% market share each, and I&#8217;m sure MSFT and RIM would be quite happy with 15% each!</p>
<p>This looks really good.  Given the failure of Windows Phone 7 I think RIM is well positioned to make a decent comeback.</p>
<p>I know people like my dad who are currently on android but hate it and want a keyboard would love to see a Blackberry 10 device with a fully modernized OS&#8230;..</p>
<p>People as in plural? Wow.</p>
<p>The problem is, generally speaking, that iOS and Android aren&#8217;t terrible. Yes, Windows Phone 7 <em>is</em> a failure(despite what the fanboys will likely say about how it&#8217;s just getting started, or something similar) but, like Microsoft, RIM have taken far, <strong>far</strong> too long to make something that&#8217;s not terrible.</p>
<p>It really depends on how you define failure for Windows Phone. The underlying OS itself is great, it&#8217;s the lack of app support that makes WP a hard sell. RIM can make the greatest OS on the planet, but they&#8217;ll have the same mountain to climb that Microsoft does to get a competitive app marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;The underlying OS itself is great&#8221;</p>
<p>I would go so far to say that the <strong>idea</strong> is great, but the OS still needs major work. It&#8217;s beautiful, it&#8217;s quick, but there are still some underlying issues as mentioned in multiple reviews that should probably be addressed before calling it &#8220;great&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mentioned in multple reviews is key&#8230;<br />
I use it everyday and disagree with what these &#8220;reviewers&#8221; have to say.  Most reviewers say the OS shines&#8230;.the apps are lacking and that&#8217;s it</p>
<p>To be fair there are multiple reviews that say the OS is great.   Its all based on opinion.  I think WP7 is far better than gingerbread Android (I have owned both).   Haven&#8217;t messed with ICS too much so i won&#8217;t comment on that.</p>
<p>Yes, it is personal opinion and I fully agree having used both Gingerbread and WP7 for a while, that latter is better. <br />
*Better is comprehensive term inclusive of UI from both visual &amp; performance (lag free) point of view, battery performance.</p>
<p>Correct, but you both are comparing it to Gingerbread, last year&#8217;s product. Otherwise, I would compare ICS to WP7 instead of 7.5. I would encourage you to try ICS on a modern smartphone to really get the gist of where Android currently is. These &#8220;lag&#8221; arguments are largely outdated.</p>
<p>ICS is still on like 4% of devices.    What a shoddy rollout&#8230;but it looks like devices are starting to see updates FINALLY.   I&#8217;m eyeing the HTC Evo LTE.  I&#8217;m actually excited to see some improvements as I LIKE android&#8230;but it just had issues for me (alot mentioned by ManuD).</p>
<p>How many devices it&#8217;s on doesn&#8217;t fucking matter if it&#8217;s still compatible with all the previous shit, which it essentially is. I hate this. People argue with OS is better, then when somebody brings up ICS, they say &#8220;hurr durr only on some phones.&#8221; Well fine.. Don&#8217;t buy those. Buy an ICS phone.</p>
<p>New apps can&#8217;t target the much more advanced ICS APIs without locking out 97 percent of android users.</p>
<p>Which has nothing to do with the present ecosystem.</p>
<p>Rubbish. I&#8217;ve just bought a HTC One X and it lags when scrolling, transitioning between home screens, bringing up the menu etc.</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t do it <em>all</em> of the time but it makes me wonder &#8211; how can you reach version 4 of a mobile operating system and still fail in your implementation of core aspects of the user experience, eg scrolling?</p>
<p>I have a Galaxy Nexus, an older device that you, and it does not lag at all.  That said, I would dispute the notion that scrolling is the core function of a mobile computing device.  Multitasking and notification is far more important&#8230; especially considering scrolling stuttering is an annoyance at best.  Android does notifications and multitasking like a champ and it allows me o customize my experience by easily switching browsers, camera software, email clients etc.</p>
<p>Scrolling is a VERY important aspect, from a pure usability stand point. If it scrolls like ass then people are going to get frustrated with it in no time. There&#8217;s no real excuse for it other than lazy implementation on either Google&#8217;s or the handset makers part.</p>
<p>Features don&#8217;t outweigh basic usability to most people. The ability for the device to actually perform supposedly simple tasks like scrolling properly are far more crucial to get right. It&#8217;d be like trying to run CS6 on a PC from 2000 or something. Sure it may run it, but the experience will be crap. It&#8217;s not what it does, it&#8217;s HOW it does it.</p>
<p>First, my Galaxy Nexus does NOT &#8220;scroll like an ass&#8221;.  In fact, there are no issues whatsoever.  I thought I made that clear.  Second, and more to the point, I don&#8217;t believe there is any actual evidence whatsoever to suggest scrolling is doing harm to the Android &#8220;experience&#8221;.  If so, marketshare/mindshare would not be growing at the fastest rate in the industry.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like Android, fine, don&#8217;t buy a device with Android.  I&#8217;m not trying to convert you.  But please, don&#8217;t give me tired talking points that don&#8217;t amount to anything.  I&#8217;m an adult.</p>
<p>Android succeeds because there is yet no real alternative to iOS.  And yes android still lags.  Jeez just browse to theverge&#8217;s desktop site and watch as your phone becomes frustratingly unresponsive.</p>
<p>I am scrolling the Verge with my Galaxy Nexus and there is no &#8220;lag&#8221; whatsoever.  Sorry.</p>
<p>Dude stop lying.  Try scrolling while the verge is loading.  The site is so insanely image heavy.  Your device&#8217;s response lag will increase massively.  Android is an obsolete OS that doesn&#8217;t prioritize the UI.</p>
<p>Well, unlike you, I actually own and operate a Galaxy Nexus device so I&#8217;m not about to argue with you about about how it performs.  Your opinions are uninformed.  That is polite talk for &#8220;you have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about&#8221;.</p>
<p>Denial is ugly trait in anyone but when Josh denies Android&#8217;s short comings with regards to user experience it becomes a bigger problem because people listen to him. In reality Android is one, perhaps even two versions away in terms of effort from being where it needs to be with regards to user experience.</p>
<p>Android will never scroll properly because it doesn&#8217;t prioritize the UI.  Fixing that one problem would require rebuilding the whole OS from scratch and breaking compatibility with all current apps.</p>
<p>Which is tantamount to describing it as &#8216;flawed by design&#8217;.</p>
<p>Most new Android phones still ship with 2.3 on them with no upgrade path, despite being more than capable of running ICS from a hardware standpoint. It&#8217;s very fair to compare WP7 to Gingerbread because that&#8217;s still what most people are using and what most phones are shipping with. This obviously shouldn&#8217;t be the case, but nobody seems to want to step up and really push ICS as much as it should be. Google should be using their influence to ensure all new devices ship with ICS.</p>
<p>The underlying OS is great! There is no core functionality that&#8217;s missing and preventing me from getting a great smartphone experience. And that core functionality works extremely well.</p>

<p>Plus the lack of ability to implement MDM via 3rd party applications means that corporate use will not take off.</p>
<p>There are issues with multitasking, lack of certain APIs, etc. Is it getting better? Yes. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t missing anything.</p>
<p>Core functionality: Can you call? Yes Text? Yup E-mail? Yup Run apps/games? Navigate? Yup. And it does that smoothly. I am regular user not a business user, for me it&#8217;s quite sufficient But anyhow every OS out there needs work so of course we&#8217;ll see even more improvements in WP8.</p>
<p>Okay, but the point is that in this day and age of BYOD to work, people need a device that can seamlessly convert from personal use to business use.</p>
<p>Also, all of the functions you describe can be done on certain featurephones as well. Just because it&#8217;s feature complete doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s up to par with the rest of the marketplace, especially with (growing) Android and <strong>especially</strong> iOS&#8217;s huge adoption in the corporate world.</p>
<p>Skype being unable to receive calls unless the app is running is a pretty major let down. It works on all their competitors platform with no issue, yet Microsoft can&#8217;t seem to get it working despite the fact they make the OS and the app itself. I know this will be fixed next update, but the fact it even exists at this stage in the game is worrying. These kind of things were fixed on other platforms several versions ago, some even predating WP7&#8217;s introduction.</p>
<p>The only decent multitasking experience I&#8217;ve had is on webOS.</p>
<p>Please or please detail the problems. And &#8220;needs major work&#8221; is a very vague statement. Tell me what other OS out there that doesn&#8217;t need major  work. If you are satisfied totally with an OS, that you claim it doesn&#8217;t need work, you shouldn&#8217;t be on a tech related site, commenting.</p>
<p>OTA updates?</p>
<p>You know what, to hell with bb10, I was going to check it out.</p>
<p>Yes and no. They&#8217;ll have a mountain to climb, but it isn&#8217;t the same mountain at all.</p>
<p>RIM has done an excellent job to make apps on their platform easy to make from the ground up AND made it easy to port your apps.</p>
<p>Obviously you would never just submit a ported app, but the fact that RIM has developed software that will do a lot of the heavy lifting for you is a big move for developers.</p>
<p>There will be no such mountain for rim as long as they maintain a home screen with a grid of icons.  WP7&#8217;s UI paradigm has turned away lots of people and is too limiting and claustrophobic.</p>
<p>The OS may be great as you said but then, so it was OS/2. The app support will eventually settle if Windows Phone or Blackberry has a future. I hope they have, but, right now, the forecast is not good.</p>
<p>Yes RIM took far too long but UNLIKE MS they had relatively greater success before the iPhone arrived on the scene no?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an Apple supporter myself so while it would take a lot for me to drop iOS I have no problems rooting for RIM to succeed. That wasn&#8217;t going to happen so long as the old CEOs were there and they refused to update the OS.</p>
<p>With todays news I&#8217;m hopeful that RIM will start to gain some momentum&#8230;.</p>
<p>Like I said Windows Phone has never been a factor in the market. Both before the iPhone and afterwards.  Blackberries on the other had was once the most popular phones on the market and there are still die hard loyalists from those golden days. So they have a better shot than MS at success IMO.</p>
<p>Windows Mobile had a huge marketshare before the iphone and android&#8230;microsoft just let it hang and did nothing with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like I said Windows Phone has never been a factor in the market. Both before the iPhone and afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second largest platform for years (to Symbian), and together with RIM practically invented the smartphone.  Your right, very much irrelevant.</p>
<p>35% Marketshare isn&#8217;t popular enough to be called popular?</p>
<p>you&#8217;re whole argument is thrown out when you said Windows Mobile was never popular.</p>
<p>your*</p>
<p>Touche.</p>
<p>Lol no android is as terrible as it gets.  The lag alone is enough to drive people away.</p>
<p>Blackberry 10 is mostly forgoing hardware keyboards as Dieter pointed out in his look at the developer device.  If you absolutely must have a hardware keybord on a phone (which is just being ignorant at this point) your only real options are the Droid devices on Verizon, which all run Android.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they are going to abandon their keyboards, that is one of the features that people love about Blackberry, so expect a keyboard version to be released.</p>
<p>Why is that being ignorant?</p>
<p>This does look promising, however, as a dev who works across all platforms (primarily iOS) &#8211; I want to say that Windows Phone 7 is not a failure. It&#8217;s like iOS before the app store &#8211; young and unfinished. Once the entire ecosystem is complete with the release of Windows 8 &#8211; I think they will start to grow.</p>
<p>Regardless of what anyone personally thinks of all the different platforms &#8211; we as devs and consumers need them all. Competition fosters new tech and ideas that might never occur with only 1 or 2 major players in the game.</p>
<p>The problem is, and always has been in my opinion, that in order to reach parity with iOS and Android, Microsoft needs to be releasing big updates at a much faster pace than Apple or Google are. Google did this(and is still doing this) in order to compete with iOS, but I don&#8217;t think Microsoft are.</p>
<p>I agree with you on that completely. They have been making moves, but none fast enough. I think this fall with help if they can stay afloat that long. M$ has a ton of money to keep the ship going till then.</p>
<p>They will make a powerful third player if they can leverage their LIVE platform and bring all the member services to all their other hardware (phones/tablets).</p>
<p>I want to like Android &#8211; I really do. Especially since my background is in mostly open source dev. However, the fragmentation (from a dev side) makes it painful for devs and clients who want Android apps at the moment.</p>
<p>The fragmentation issue is a shame, though I don&#8217;t expect Google to be responsible for updating handsets. Truth be told, I don&#8217;t even think the networks would like that, as it would potentially limit their ability to sell a new phone at some point.<br />
If some sort of theme engine is included in Jelly Bean, that allowed the likes of Samsung to supply the files for their skin and Android could compartmentalise that and keep it separate from the OS and Samsung didn&#8217;t need to in any way change the skin to have it work with future versions, that&#8217;d be a huge help.</p>
<p>You do bring some valid points, however I do see a market for Windows Phone in the future. Fragmentation was one of the biggest reasons why I didn&#8217;t buy an Android phone because the platform generally seems inconsistent in terms of user experience.</p>
<p>Second problem I have with Android is that alot of high-end phones are increasing screen szie and if you are in the market for anything around 4, you pretty much have to settle for a mid-range and lose out on the experience.</p>
<p>I settled for Windows Phone because buying an Iphone with  a contract was flat out expensive and I reasonable alternative was Windows Phone. It provides a similar consistent ecosystem as IOS, but lacks the content and I was fully aware of this when I purchased the phone.</p>
<p>If Nokia and MS get their acts together in order to minimize prices and attract people who arrent interested in getting contracts, I think they can win in this segment.</p>
<p>It is a shame, and it makes it hard to make &#8220;Android Apps&#8221; for the cost as apps for other platforms that would work across the same number of hardware devices. (A lot more testing and coding to ensure greater compatibility).</p>
<p>See I think this is where Google dropped the ball. Apple pushed out iOS updates without the consent of AT&amp;T or any other carriers. They took the responsibility into their own hands.</p>
<p>With Android, they went the &#8220;Windows OEM&#8221; route, letting these manufactures customize and load their software before spitting out there devices, and then are dependent on the cell networks to push out these updates which have no benefit to them directly.</p>
<p>As crazy as it sounds, I think they need to either A. integrate a separate way to handle the skinning as your suggested, or begin to roll out updates themselves and decide that the skins are optional items, that can be added at a later time via download from the carrier.</p>
<p>Sure, Apple do do that, but they know the exact hardware for each device and can make one update for the current phone and a slightly different one for two other phones that they choose to support.</p>
<p>Practically every Android handset has different hardware inside it, needing different drivers. It isn&#8217;t and should not be Google&#8217;s problem, but I understand that for consumers, they choose to blame them.</p>
<p>Microsoft is in a similar situation to Apple as they dictate which hardware is allowed inside Windows Phone 7 Phones, so they can be all high and mighty about updates, but it&#8217;s really because they&#8217;re running a dictatorship.</p>
<p>Compartmentalizing might help a lot. If I&#8217;m remembering correctly, didn&#8217;t Google bundle Gmail, Youtube, etc. directly into the OS at some point? This made updates to those core apps dependent upon OS updates (which often take far too long). That was the way to go for core apps and if the same approach could be taken to other parts of the OS, THAT would be a win win for consumers. Cutting out the carriers would help put an end to (or lessen the impact of) OS fragmentation.</p>
<p>Originally, this was the case. Most &#8216;core&#8217; application updates are now not related to the OS being updated at all. The Browser app is the most notable one, but that&#8217;s going to be moot as soon as Chrome leaves beta and replaces it.</p>
<p>I think the issue is that people say that these phones are Android phones, rather than phones running Android (and whatever underlying modifications the OEMs have made to it).</p>
<p>Phones running Android with TouchWiz are a completely different experience  than phones running Android with MotoBlur. But they both run the apps that consumers want them to run. And consumers will continue to buy them if they meet or exceed the consumers&#8217; expectations and/or needs/wants.</p>
<p>To be fair Google releases a major update once a year.  Same as Microsoft so far.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so much the frequency of their updates, but in how they are delivered.</p>
<p>Consumers get mad a Google for their lack of OS update, when the carriers/hardware providers are to blame. It&#8217;s bad press for Google, and is the biggest contributor to the current fragmentation issue.</p>
<p>Microsoft runs into these same issues with carriers, however, on even minor updates to phones.</p>
<p>Well i think its a bit better to have trouble on the minor updates but be relatively solid on the major updates (though to be fair only one down the pipe now.).</p>
<p>Its interesting though, Nokia is able to update their Lumia devices almost Apple like&#8230;.fast and without much carrier interference.</p>
<p>Well then you run into the issue with no OTA updates&#8230; that&#8217;s frustrating in itself.</p>
<p>Agreed.   Silly really.  It notifies you there is an update&#8230;but you need a computer to complete it.   How WebOS had this right before Apple and MS is beyond me&#8230;but at least Apple got it finally.</p>
<p>Two major updates a year, typically, which is more than Apple. Microsoft needs to beat both to have a chance. They&#8217;re not doing that.</p>
<blockquote>Given the failure of Windows Phone 7</blockquote>
<p>Why is wp7 a failure?</p>
<p>Probably because of the lack of marketshare penetration over the last year and 3/4, the lack of quality and widely used apps/games, the tiny bugs and inconsistencies that still exist after the aforementioned year and 3/4 time. Then there&#8217;s Nokia&#8217;s financials, which look pretty bad currently.</p>
<p>Basically, the platform is leaning solely on Microsoft&#8217;s ability to keep throwing money at a project until it can fly on its own.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t Google do the exact same thing?</p>
<p>Not quite. Google didn&#8217;t advertise Android. OEMs picked it up and ran with it. One might argue that it was Motorola&#8217;s &#8220;Droid Does&#8221; campaign that pushed the platform forward in the eyes of the consumer. But the growth was fast and inevitable, as Android allowed OEMs to create smartphones that rivaled the iPhone without having to write their own OS from the ground up.</p>
<p>Good point, but what i&#8217;m saying is, is there anything really wrong with MS&#8217;s method?   Its the method needed in a world dominated by Android and iOS.     MS didn&#8217;t have the HUGE benefit of being able to come out prior to iOS showing up on multiple carriers.   I mean, Verizon customers were lusting for something like the iPhone when the original Droid came out.</p>
<p>Yes its MS fault they are behind in the cycle&#8230;.I think the landscape would look very different if they launched WP7 same time as the Droid.  But the fact is&#8230;they didn&#8217;t&#8230;so they are going to have to throw money at the project to keep it afloat&#8230;and in my mind, there is nothing wrong with that from a profitable company.</p>
<p>Hell, i still wish HP did that with WebOS&#8230;still some of my favorite UI elements.</p>
<p>Very true. Sometimes I feel like they&#8217;re using that as an excuse to slowly push out updates that are very much wanted and needed. Not to mention having Nokia move to exclusivity with WP7 despite dismal numbers on their part. I just hope MS can keep both WP7 and Nokia afloat while they get it up to speed with the rest of the market.</p>
<p>Well Nokia is clearly going to be the highest selling WP maker.    It does seem like the 900 is going well in America&#8230;so hopefully there is some growth there.</p>
<p>What is really annoying is I&#8217;m on Sprint and I bought an HTC Arrive on craigslist just to play with and it quickly became my main device over my HTC Evo.   But a year later with no word on a future WP7 device&#8230;and I am always a choose your carrier first man and Sprint hsa been good to me (though their LTE situation really is frustrating)&#8230;.but my contract is up in June and I think i am going back to android just because there is no other WP7 device I could go to.</p>
<p>It sounds like Sprint and Verizon are waiting until WP8&#8230;but its really just frustrating as I am not the only CDMA customer waiting for more WP devices.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t inevitable. Without Verizon pushing the droid brand the platform would faded into irrelevance.  That&#8217;s why google was willing to be evil and flip flop on network neutrality in return for partnering with Verizon.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say WIndows 7 is a failure. Lets see in another year.</p>
<p>However, I want Blackberry to succeed. I&#8217;m not a fanboy and I believe competition is great for innovation. How amazing will the smart phone industry be in 5-10 years if there are 4-5 companies competing neck-to-neck?</p>
<p>Its true, as much as people rail on BlackBerry, they have a very loyal fan base. But those fans have their hands tied since BlackBerry phones are sub par now. If they can get with the game they will definitely get their market back!</p>
<p>Vocal, not necessarily loyal, just like the people who would like to see Windows Phone succeed, but probably don&#8217;t care enough to buy a device. And no, there&#8217;s no definitely about it.<br />
If Google stopped Android development today and didn&#8217;t release a new version for 2 years(which is the equivalent of how badly RIM dropped the ball) and <em>then</em> released Jelly Bean or some other cool update, they&#8217;d have no guarantee that anyone would give a crap and they&#8217;d deserve it, just like RIM does.</p>
<p>I think the loyal fan base has been ignored long enough that they have moved on to other phones/platforms (hence the sad state of world affairs at RIM).  This all looks interesting enough as a tech nerd, but then again so did webOS, MeeGo etc.  Their interesting into tying this into an automobile seems at odds with things like BES etc.  Lets hope this reinvention pays off and that RIM can innovate its way into a success.</p>
<p>Well put. RIM is the perfect example of a company who was on top and felt no need to innovate when competition arose.</p>
<p>I LOVED my BB, however, it got lost in a sea of high-end touch screen devices and were more user friendly and efficient.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to hoping they survive the &#8220;Storm&#8221; (see what i did there) and can make a comeback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a loyal BlackBerry fan and I don&#8217;t feel my hands are tied because I don&#8217;t think my 9930 is subpar.  I will use it until a QWERTY BB10 phone comes out.</p>
<p>I thought Verge did not want to use scribble live for liveblogging :-D</p>
<p>Only &#8220;real time OS&#8221; on the market?  I highly doubt that.</p>
<p>Ud be highly wrong. Its the reason the purchased QNX. Do ur homework.</p>
<p>It depends as to exactly what&#8217;s meant by that phrase. If it means true multi-tasking, they should say that. Saying it&#8217;s the only <em>real time</em> operating system on the market will just result in jibes. Every word that comes out of a presenter&#8217;s mouth at these events should be scrutinised in advance.</p>
<p>And so would you. There are a number of official real-time OS&#8217;s. The most common being Windows CE.</p>
<p>Speaking of homework. Learn to spell.</p>
<p>You need to do your English homework more than anything else.  Typing the full &#8220;you&#8221; makes your argument seem like it wasn&#8217;t typed by a 13 year old and all the more valid.</p>
<p>Uhh Windows CE&#8230;happens to be a real-time OS framework as well..They need to do home work as well.</p>
<p>Uh is anyone basing their future device strategy on windows ce.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no point. They&#8217;ve burned too many people with some of their more-recent devices.<br />
In truth an Android QWERTY keyboard slider phone, any of them, is a much better option than any Blackberry, if all you want are physical keys.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still loling at people saying this mix of WebOS, Symbian Belle, ICS and Metro UI is better than WP7 and Android&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry. If I wanted a phone that had all &#8230; oh wait I DON&quot;T WANT THAT! I want my phone to be unique not to have a ton (because it&#8217;s not a bit&#8230;) of everything.</p>
<p>If they could guarantee some way of upgrading existing Blackberry Models to BB 10(Say at least a 2 year old machine), then RIM could have instant market share which would entice developers. <br />
I&#8217;m not sure how people on the fence deciding on a new phone in October are going to choose RIM over iOS or Android. But people stuck in contracts would love to upgrade. Maybe if its a flash your ROM thing they could do it in store for people&#8230; There 10s of millions of BB phones sitting out there, it would be a wasted opportunity to not try and upgrade them.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, but I believe that RIM doesn&#8217;t even have a dual-core device available right now. Version 10 of the OS, <em>if</em> it is a major upgrade, will almost certainly be using a lot of horsepower and their devices going forward are likely to be almost all(if not all) dual-core or above, so it&#8217;d be tough(and make little sense for the effort) to upgrade legacy models.</p>
<p>Plus, really, RIM&#8217;s market share ain&#8217;t that great.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make all the hater/fanboys happy and pretend Windows Phone explodes and implodes and ceases to exist.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d give Blackberry 10 and even iOS a chance before going back to Android.</p>
<p>70% of that is realizing, after using Android on a couple of devices, that the OS I choose hardly makes a difference in my mobile life and I can easily acclimate to ANY operating system (as I have done already, having flip flopped between OSs and currently using a WP7 phone with an Andoid tablet).<br />
The other 30% being so sick of fAndroids and the hype.</p>
<p>Even if WP doesn&#8217;t utterly fail, Blackberry still on my list of considerating for the future.</p>
<p>Interesting. i&#8217;m thinking that only about 30-40% of the comments on here have anything to do with RIM&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>I was getting annoyed because of my blatant RIM fanboi-ism before I realised that the proof of whether the blackberry is dead will be Q4 reporting, and the reading of the comments in Q3 when its supposed to be released. Everything else is a (mostly well-constructed) argument over what&#8217;s currently vapourware&#8230; I can&#8217;t see it or touch the final product in my hands, so it might as well be.</p>
<p>Its enough to make me reach for my mango iOS ICS device.</p>
<p>Really?  Do I have to be the one to say that the bottom bar make the phone look like ICS?  I&#8217;m not even a huge fan of Android&#8217;s UI but c&#8217;mon..</p>
<p>I see elements of WP7 (quarter widgets), HTC&#8217;s sense (notification bar), iOS (folders), and MIUI.</p>
<p>Yes, Apple invented the <em>folder icon</em>, as well as the personal pronoun, asexual reproduction and the cotton gin.</p>
<p>so you gloss over everything else he says to be a trollish assH+le . . . . . Good job. And yes&#8230; no one else does that folder style but apple</p>
<p>You do know there is no censorship on here, right? Hell, one of the most popular images on The Verge has cursing right in it.</p>
<p><img src="http://designofjosh.com/Files/images/shitstormjoshua2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Not to mention that trying to evade the swear filter on any site never makes you look good. You&#8217;re always better off just saying what you want and getting censored if a censor&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>can&#8217;t stop laughing!!!</p>
<p>LOL THATS AWESOME</p>
<p>Actually no&#8230;.. Maemo does that folder style too hell you can get that folder effect in Symbian for that matter</p>
<p>I see elements of Maemo and Symbian in there too</p>
<p>You know what folks? if you look at every mobile OS or even desktop OS you&#8217;ll find similarities across the board</p>
<p>I believe it was Eli Whitney that invented the cotton gin. I remember learning that one February during elementary school.</p>
<p>A white man&#8217;s invention in relation to cotton processing during black history month, how appropriate.</p>
<p>it was a reply to someone else who mentioned the cotton gin; but you are right it is appropriate for this month especially (something along the lines of being doomed to repeat it if we dont know it)</p>
<p>Uhhh&#8230;. <img src="http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2009/03/apple-lisa-1.gif" /></p>
<p>Remove the bottom title of the widgets and yah, they look a lot like live tiles.</p>
<p><img src="http://i429.photobucket.com/albums/qq15/Shwanger78/BlackberryLiveTile02.jpg" /></p>
<p>the top of that 2nd pic definitely had a visit to the &#8217;shop&#8230; maybe even ms paint.</p>
<p>What specifically are you talking about? This does not remind me of ICS at all, in fact, it looks like bits of things, not specific things.</p>
<p>In various windows throughout ICS the bottom bar looks remarkably like that.</p>
<p>And I suppose Google was the first ever to use simple icons on a flat bar?</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t say that&#8230;at all&#8230;perhaps reading comprehension  isn&#8217;t your strong suit</p>
<p>You implied that this was somewhat a copy of ICS, which it&#8217;s not. Pretty generic but neat design.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t tell if you&#8217;re kidding or serious</p>
<p>Actually, both it and ICS look like webOS.</p>
<p>It actually looks more like Belle to me.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just too funny.</p>
<p>beast approves of any belle references.</p>
<p>nah, its just a doc. Seems like a basic UI element if you ask me.</p>
<p>Nope, that look has been done in many places before ICS and feels more like some simplified Sense-inspired skins I&#8217;ve seen. It&#8217;s more about the greys and less about the neon. Also, it looks much better than ICS, sad to say.</p>
<p>How many different ways can you place icons on a screen with a toolbar?</p>
<p>Looks like a mix of iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Probably trying the old strategy of taking the strengths and leaving out the weaknesses of two targets and combining them.</p>
<p>Seemed to work for the Playbook.</p>
<p>Yeah, that was certainly a hit.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>The Playbook failed at its original price point. The OS itself is actually fun to use, merging WebOS with everything else.</p>
<p>This is exactly what RIM has needed to do from the start. They&#8217;ve thus far attempted to avoid adopting design cues and usability innovations from the other platforms for whatever reason. It&#8217;s as if someone only recently told them it&#8217;s okay to learn from others.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Nokia Belle, enough said.</p>
<p>And belle looks like Android&#8230;back to square one.</p>
<p>Palm created WebOS in half the time its taking RIM, yet WebOS was original had a great design and was different, Rim has taken the approach of stealing from IOS,Android and Belle and taking much longer.</p>
<p>Yeah, reminds me lot of a Palm Pre</p>
<p>In that it will fail so bad, you&#8217;re right</p>
<p>RIM acquired a company named QNX whose platform they are using for their next line of smartphones. It&#8217;s in use on the Playbook and works pretty well save for a few things left out, only coming later this month in the form of a software update (including a native e-mail client).</p>
<p>The problem with RIM is that their reputation and business model is built upon requiring security certification and integration with their existing corporate software. They aren&#8217;t just introducing a new cell phone, it has to be tightly integrated with an entire ecosystem. It&#8217;s also not stealing to bring an OS into the next generation.</p>
<p>Except for the minor fact that Blackberry has been around longer than any of those, and these designs are a logical evolution of long-established look n&#8217; feel.  Oh, but I forgot &#8211; the world began the day you bought your smartphone.</p>
<p>rim&#8217;s older, but blackberry isn&#8217;t. They were doing Motorola&#8217;s bidding for ages with their skytell network.</p>
<p>The RIM as you know it, and the beginning of their blackberry phase started a good 3 or so years after Hawkin&#8217;s had already shipped his first pda with palm.</p>
<p>in all seriousness, your last comment applies to you 4x more than most people in this forum.</p>
<p>&gt; Palm created WebOS in half the time its taking RIM</p>
<p>Palm spent of 6 years trying to develop Palm OS 6 before finally running out of money and throwing the whole thing away.  With a last gasp hail mary, they slapped together open source Linux OS and open source WebKit in 6 months and called it WebOS, and it was a colossal failure.</p>
<p>In the 3+ years the WebOS was under development Palm could  never solve the many performance and stability problems in WebOS.</p>
<p>BlackBerry 10 is already way ahead of WebOS in that regard.</p>
<p>Nova/webOS was under development since at least September 2007 (probably before), so development was a minimum of 16 months before unveiling and 21 months before release. It certainly wasn&#8217;t &#8220;slapped together.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Palm spent of 6 years trying to develop Palm OS 6 before finally running out of money and throwing the whole thing away</em></p>
<p>Nope.  PalmSource was spun off from Palm in an effort to create a multi-vendor hardware ecosystem that would allow the former Palm (then PalmOne), Sony, Kyocera, Samsung and others to develop hardware that all ran on Palm OS.</p>
<p>Access bought Palm OS, and it stagnated under them.</p>
<p>webOS was an effort at a total reboot of Palm by a totally new set of investors and managers.  The goal was to recapture control of the entire ecosystem (and unify it under one manufacturer), disrupt the market, and create a new major platform overnight.</p>
<p>Palm did gain and own complete control over webOS for all of its commercial life (including under HP), but that turned out to be a liability.  When HP killed webOS devices, users were stuck (unlike in the days when Sony killed the Clie, but PalmOS users could still go to Palm, Kyocera or others to get a device).</p>
<p>Palm totally disrupted the market (people often forget this).  The tech media and general media proclaimed the Pre as the &#8220;phone to unseat the iPhone,&#8221; and things got downright fearful in Apple-ville.  I remember reading negative headline after negative headline on Apple blogs about &#8220;beleaguered Palm,&#8221; begging people not to consider the Pre.  Apple went on the offensive immediately, shutting the Pre out of the iTunes digital music monopoly through multiple updates of iTunes, as well as issuing threats of lawsuits.  That&#8217;s quite a splash for a company as small as Palm.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, total &#8220;clean breaks&#8221; from legacy are HUGE risks in the tech business.  What shipped from Palm was very different post-webOS than pre-webOS (pardon the pun), and a lot of Palm customers either stuck with their 755p, Centro, or Treo Pro handsets, or moved on to other OSes when they realized webOS wasn&#8217;t going to support their legacy apps at all.</p>
<p>Palm didn&#8217;t get wide distribution on all the major carriers, immediately &#8212; a mistake.  The advertising was&#8230; ummm&#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say I still have nightmares from time to time.  Developers didn&#8217;t come to the party, and Palm never got global distribution &#8212; entire markets like China and India never received a device.  Hardware quality also wasn&#8217;t great, especially in the earliest versions.  By trying to &#8220;do it all&#8221; themselves, Palm ultimately found that there were several components they couldn&#8217;t get right.</p>
<p>RIM would do well to heed those lessons, since it&#8217;s trying the Palm approach &#8212; new OS, clean break from the past, doing all the hardware themselves, no developer support, unclear carrier support&#8230; but BB 10 doesn&#8217;t have the same disruption potential as webOS showed in early 2009 after its unveiling.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve added Android emulation.</p>
<p>Looks sweet, I don&#8217;t care who did it first, but who does it best. And if they pull off taking the best of ios, android, windows, and webos and turning it into a cohesive smooth running os, then count me in.</p>
<p>Looks fine to me. You can&#8217;t expect anything groundbreaking from a WIMP design. It&#8217;s going to be all in the execution. It needs to be smooth, lag-free, bug-free, with essential features near perfect.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve got a long hill to climb as they are basically the last major to get out of the gate last with an post-iPhone operating system, and the webOS (3rd) failed, WP7 stalled at the starting gate, and Symbian essentially withdrawn from the field. It&#8217;s going to take execution, execution, execution to maintain the current RIM userbase, then to grow.</p>
<p>At least RIM is well aware of the importance of UI hardware acceleration (having implemented on their dated platform under OS7). I&#8217;d wager they need more than anything to have a solid hardware in addition to their seemingly solid software (QNX on the Playbook is actually quite impressive).  If it has a high resolution display and some solid internals, it&#8217;ll be a great competitor to the Android devices. Being compatible with Android SDKs are a huge plus.</p>
<p>No, no, no. Being Android compatible is negative. A huge negative. It&#8217;s terrible messaging to their loyal BB7 developers and terrible messaging to prospective BB10 developers. You do not support your competitor&#8217;s platform unless you have a viable strategy to profit from it, and as far as I can see, there are none.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there has been successful OS or platform that has ever been able to follow this strategy. It splits the resources of the BB10 development team, it makes Android apps on BB10 second class citizens, it reduces the resources and developers using the native BB10 platform.</p>
<p>Waste of time. Every single bit of development time should be used to get a good release out the door. Maybe Apple&#8217;s Bootcamp is a good counter to this thought, but I&#8217;m not sure that situation applies for RIM.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t run Android apps outright unless you&#8217;re using the developer tools and side-loading it unofficially. The change was in providing tools to easily convert existing Android applications into .bar files for use with QNX. They are not supporting the Android platform, they&#8217;re just making it easier to reuse existing code.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how it is any different from Blackberry supporting JavaME apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t think there has been successful OS or platform that has ever been able to follow this strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can.  Kindle.  They have taken Android and made their own platform and in less than 6 months, they may be making as much from it (if not more if you count application sales) than Google.</p>
<p>Why does anyone spend millions developing mobile OSes anymore?</p>
<p>Just make a beautiful phone and slap the open source ICS on it.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>The same reason why Samsung is developing Bada OS and persistently applies Touchwiz to their devices. You have to provide a product different from the rest. It&#8217;s difficult when you all have the same stuff, not to mention coming from an external company.</p>
<p>And yet no company focuses on selling stock Android.</p>
<p>&#8216;And yet&#8217;? What&#8217;s that supposed to mean, your statement is in complete agreement with his post. No-one wants to make stock Android phones because there&#8217;s little room to differentiate, other than making gimmicky hardware changes for its own sake (eg the Motorola &#8216;corners&#8217; or Nexus contoured display)</p>
<p>WOW omg such insight you must be a CEO or some revolutionary technology mastermind to have thought of that. You sir are one of the great thinkers of our time!</p>
<p>And then get sued (or be forced to license) by Microsoft/Apple/RIM/etc. for using an OS that violates their patents on said beautiful phone.</p>
<p>Because ICS SUCKS.  It drains battery super fast because it RUNS IN A VM, and it lags because its UI thread is at the same priority as apps.</p>
<p>How is that working out for Motorola?  LG?  Sony? HTC?</p>
<p>Yea.  That is right.  Not that well.  Working great for Samsung though.</p>
<p>whatever it&#8217;s a mix of it&#8217;s really bad.</p>
<p>Not impressed</p>
<p>RIM should just go with Android or WP7 (If Microsoft pays them)</p>
<p>That would be horrible. Check out a Playbook,. QNX is a solid platform.</p>
<p>i cant find one. do they even sell them anymore.</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve been reduced in price. I&#8217;m not sure about elsewhere, but over here they&#8217;ve been selling like crazy at its price starting at $199. Check out Best Buy and whatnot.</p>
<p>No it&#8217;s not</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s clear most of you are set on bashing whatever RIM comes out with, no matter what</p>
<p>The problem is that the world has pretty much agreed that they&#8217;re the 4th option in a 3-horse race. For RIM to get a positive response, they either need to hop on Android or WP7  (like Nokia did) or come out with something wholly different.</p>
<p>Otherwise, everyone&#8217;s going to (rightfully) call out how it&#8217;s just &#8220;me-too&#8221;-ing the other OS&#8217;s.</p>
<p>That makes absolutely no sense. Having RIM as a 4th option, throwing their whole company behind Blackberry 10 and attempting to compete with the other smartphone vendors out there is GOOD FOR CONSUMERS! Competition creates better products for everyone.</p>
<p>QnX is something different.  The OS may be the highest quality OS I have ever used.  The damn thing is amazingly rock solid and safe.  As a base, they could not have picked a better starting point.</p>
<p>I hope they execute on it well as I have lots of respect for QnX.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually noticing the main bashing coming from the android fanbots who hate anything but and have never used a playbook or actually paid for an app. You&#8217;re not the customers who would use a new berry anyway so your comments are ignored. Bottom line, qnx is an awesome os.  Anything that threatens your precioushackable android you dismiss. BB10 can easily pass wp7. Just needs good apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;BB10 can easily pass wp7&#8221; &#8211; must be true, WP8 will come out at the same time with BB10. If they cannot even beat WP7, how could they survive WP8 + ICS + iOS 6?</p>
<p>Anyone can survive ICS.  No one actually &#8220;likes&#8221; Android.  It&#8217;s buggy, laggy, and drains battery too fast.</p>
<p>Yep.  Go to Engadget and the RIM hate is unbelievable.  They need someone to look down on to support their bizarre worldviews.</p>
<p>Looks like they phoned it in.</p>
<p>The bottom left of that second image looks awfully photoshoped. The phone icon has a different background color and extends beyond the physical screen.</p>
<p>Not that this couldn&#8217;t be a mockup, but it&#8217;d be weird for a design proposal to be that shoddily put together.</p>
<p>The article on Crackberry states that the hardware in all of these photos are existing Blackberry OS7 devices but with the UI put over it.</p>
<p>lmao. in the second pic, the clock app on the bottom left doesn&#8217;t even have the same time as itself.</p>
<p>that&#8217;s an alarm time you dolt</p>
<p>none of the times match. its really bad, sorry.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>are you a potato?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not holding my breath RIM.  Ever since the Bold, you have disappointed me on so many occasions.  Sadly, reading comments by RIM fans on CrackBerry make me think they have Stockholm Syndrome or something.  Please prove me wrong!</p>
<p>Interesting how the weather widget on the first shot is of Stockholm&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Rc01q.gif" /></p>
<p>Looks decent enough, it&#8217;s just at least 2 years late.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m impressed.</p>
<p>This, ladies and gentlemen, is a classic example of a controlled leak.</p>
<p>Exactly! New CEO gives first interview to Crackberry. &#8220;Leaked&#8221; images of their new device show up on Crackberry. Now they have exclusive pics of the new OS? Okay, RIM.</p>
<p>Heck, they practically used a hand model.</p>
<p>If you actually cared to read the source article, then you would know these images were pulled from prototype marketing materials to be distributed to RIMs partners&#8230; so yeah, they would do their best to make it look good.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s a hand model, mama. A finger jockey. They think differently than the face and body boys&#8230; they&#8217;re a different breed.</p>
<p>It looks decent but the hardware has gotta be excellent too. As do the apps. And the &#8216;message&#8217;. Web OS was decent as well.</p>
<p>I would love for RIM to really become a viable third alternative to iOS and Android.. but that doesn&#8217;t mean I want an OS that&#8217;s a mashup of the two.</p>
<p>(not saying that&#8217;s what they are building.. it&#8217;s just what two screenshots make it look like)</p>
<p>I said it with the Playbook, and the same holds true for this.. they will fail &#8211; miserably and completely &#8211; if they attempt to compete head-on with Apple and the Android crew. Creating a lifestyle device for 18-34-year-olds outside of the workplace is a loosing proposition for them. That ship sailed in 2009. it&#8217;s done. they lost.</p>
<p>But they can build a niche for themselves if they create something that leverages their <strong>dwindling</strong> expertise in messaging and the enterprise. &#8230;Something unique, that streamlines text communications and delivers emails faster, better and more securely.. something that is an all-business get-work-done device first and an entertainment device second.</p>
<p>The fact that there are icons for cut the rope and music players and not for office documents and reminders shows they&#8217;ve got the wrong set of priorities.</p>
<p>What they need to do is cut off the smartphone side of the business and focus on what they&#8217;re great at, selling BIS and Secure email servers or services. They need to go enterprise and work with the major smartphone OS&#8217;s.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is no way RIM is going to be the viable third alternative at this point.  The impending battle of ecoystems is real and the top dogs will be Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a tough battle to go it alone.<br />
Palm failed, Nokia saw the writing on the wall and shifted&#8230;.</p>
<p>It just feels too late.  The OS wars have killed the weaker beasts, leaving the 3 remaining Behemoths.<br />
I don&#8217;t even think that it being a fantastic OS would save it now.</p>
<p>They have BBM running on it!</p>
<p>Also&#8230;this is more reminiscent of Meizu than anything else.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.interactcomputers.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-o-matic/cache/88dfe_Meizu_MX_Home_Screen_1_610x915.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It has muted tones. Other than that it may as well look like iOS.</p>
<p>What ROM is that?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be surprised if Apple didn&#8217;t have a patent on the look of folders with small icons on the springboard (or whatever RIM calls it).</p>
<p>It may look like iOS, Android, and Windows P7, but if BB plays their cards right this could be the next big&#8230; lawsuit.</p>
<p>I like it a lot. Also, I find it very strange that people don&#8217;t appreciate a fourth large player coming out with something on their own. &#8220;Go with the mainstream and get ICS&#8221; &#8211; is that really the solution? I got a feeling this is is gonna be an amazing product. The next generation after this is hopefully gonna incorporate some of these features haha:<br />
<img src="http://www.netbooknews.de/wp-content/uploads/BlackBerry-Concept-2012.jpg" /></p>
<p>That screen is stupid.</p>
<p>Not content with copying just webOS on the Playbook, RIM has also taken to copying WP7.</p>
<p>Oh, so did Apple copy RIM by using rows of icons for apps? Two can play at that game, bud</p>
<p>No, they copied Palm OS :)</p>
<p>Anyone else think photo-realistic icons (Phone, Recorder, Clock, Notes) are a <em>really </em>bad idea?</p>
<p>Developers that care can mimic the style of iOS and Android icons, so the app icon &#8220;fits in&#8221; with its respective OS. With photo-realistic icons, though, you seriously limit people&#8217;s options.</p>
<p>For instance, try to make a photo-realistic icon for &#8220;Cut the Rope&#8221; or anything else that doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;real&#8221; counterpart. It would be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Does anyone else think this looks really obviously fake, especially the phone icon on the second picture?<br />
I&#8217;ve seen mockups that are more convincing than this image&#8230;<br />
I have no comment on the OS itself. It&#8217;s just another touch screen OS.</p>
<p>Cut the rc, two phone buttons, 2 facebook apps.</p>
<p>nice job rim.</p>
<p>Who the hell cares? It&#8217;s a mock-up</p>
<p>I think it looks really slick. I&#8217;m definitely an Android junkie but I&#8217;m really pulling for RIM. This looks like a definite step in the right direction if they can finally get developer support.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d make another app for BB10 if they give out phones like they are giving out Playbooks now. I already got one for free and am about to get another from porting an android app.</p>
<p>Sold the first one before the crazy price drop. Might actually keep the new one to try BB10.</p>
<p>Great. So Windows Phone is the odd one out of all these OS? I think BB10 is born off an orgy of smartphone OS.</p>
<p>Soooo&#8230;. thanks Verge, looks like I might be selling my RIM stock tomorrow! Yay rumours! :-)</p>
<p>On another note, RIM get bought off or roll over and die so you can source code for your Brelease the BB10 OS. If that happens, my HD2 will be able to run it. Just for bragging rights and all. Hmm it reminds of a similar situation that happened but can&#8217;t guess what was it.</p>
<p>ignore the B before release. :p</p>
<p>Until I see it in action, can&#8217;t really say much. With Windows Phone 8 Apollo at the end of the year, and perhaps iOS6, RIM will have to bring something truly amazing (key word here) to the table. ICS proved to be the much needed update for Android, and now is just as aesthetically please as both iOS and WP; sadly, this BB10 just looks like a copy of all of them.</p>
<p>The very reason even WP7 is getting recognized as the &#8220;third&#8221; ecosystem, is because its different. iOS and Android resemble each other in many aspects; the last thing we need is another look-a-like.</p>
<p>I actually want RIM to succeed, they do make good phones, it&#8217;&#8217;s just their platform that&#8217;s behind. If they can get this thing on par with other OSes, I might actually consider it.</p>
<p>These look digitally modified to me. My point is that the second image has details within the status bar that don&#8217;t line up to the insignia on the phone&#8217;s body (assuming that the design team decided to center the date). It&#8217;s just not convincing enough for me.</p>
<p>As for the first one, I can&#8217;t find much to say about it either, other than the fact that both screens seem to show everything so clearly without much or any glare whatsoever. Which makes me remind myself that the new Blackberries won&#8217;t have a Super AMOLED screen. So what&#8217;s up with that.</p>
<p>Just some observations.</p>
<p>Who cares if it looks good or even if it functions well.  Theres no developer support, infact there are developers leaving blackberry os.  By the time rim comes out with this system and gets it into the hands of consumers and developers, a large part of their customers will have already upgraded to either windows phone, ios or android. Nobody is going to pay to get out of their contract for this system,  because it isn&#8217;t a sure thing that its even going to be worth it.  If i have another phone whats the draw for me to buy out of my contract to get a blackberry at a point when their &#8216;new&#8217; technology is already behind everybody else?</p>
<p>LOL BLACKBERRY</p>
<p>After purchasing a Blackberry Storm with a touchscreen that didn&#8217;t work in humid weather and then a Blackberry Tour whose trackball decided not to scroll at all, I&#8217;m excited to see RIM slowly fall into the abyss, Palm-style.  They&#8217;ve burned all goodwill with me</p>
<p>RIM doesn&#8217;t know how to make operating systems. They know how to make a subpar messaging app thats about it.</p>
<p>Suicide!!! If a company with resources of Microsoft has a hard time establishing a new mobile OS. Who the hell will care about RIM???</p>
<p>Live tiles :)</p>
<p>Oh so RIM is finally deciding to use a Android Skin instead of making their own OS, finally. Been getting sick of seeing they&#8217;re shit awful designs.</p>
<p>So RIM has finally resorted to copying the rest of the competitors? Not surprised, not surprised at all.</p>
<p>But even this unoriginal BB OS revamp will not convince me to buy a blackberry.</p>
<p>RIM getting sued by Apple in 1&#8230;2&#8230;<br />
but I have to say, it looks nice, even if (or because?) it looks a lot like Android. Nothing new though.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite clearly a hacked together image, not even a good one. However, if they did do something like this, it could be pretty cool. I do doubt that Blackberry 10 will look like this though.</p>
<p>I actually think this has a better chance than windows phone.</p>
<p>no chance whatsoever lol :)</p>
<p>am I the only one who thinks all these mobile OSes are starting to look similar to each other, except for Windows Phone?</p>
<p>but too bad, people hate on Windows Phone for being different.</p>
<p>I respect WP7 being different. I hate it for being ugly :P</p>
<p>Can anyone not see the whole photoshop tells in the photo? Top right corner of the phone and bottom left corner&#8230; <del>__</del>&quot;</p>
<p>I have been wrong many times before&#8230; but I feel like this is obvious.</p>
<p>It actually looks quite good! I like it! I can obviously see the mix from other operating systems, but it is a nice mix! I&#8217;d like to have a device like this.</p>
<p>Why in the world would a full touch screen device have the need for a trackpad? That doesn&#8217;t make any sense. It looks like crap.</p>
<p>Interesting. In some ways it looks like a scaled down Playbook. But there&#8217;s some influence from other OSs. Like those tile-widget things. It&#8217;s an interesting take.</p>
<p>Ah just remembered! The tile-widgets reminded me of the Xperia X1.</p>
<p>these are not live screens!!   they all have the time of 12:00pm in the top bar.  just screenshots on an old device</p>
<p>it looks very generic feature phone-ish</p>
<p>Seems like they are mostly making it to look like an Apple or Droid, smart move seeing as those are the leading products.<br />
They probably leaked these photos to generate more interest. Obviously.</p>

<p>I can actually see BB10 taking off faster than Windows Phone, they&#8217;re an established brand in the mobile space. But no doubt Microsoft will be pushing on all fronts, it will be interesting to see who fares better as #3</p>

<p>WindowsPhone 7 was originally going to have a second chassis, with a blackberry like design. But it was canceled. It will be interesting to see if RIM can bring a good app experience to both full screen, and qwerty portrait smartphones. No other company is attempting to do this. <br />

<p>This is honestly a killer form factor for a lot of people. It was somewhat available in the dell venue pro, but the support behind that thing was terrible&#8230;and let&#8217;s skip on how bulk that was.<br />
Even the android versions like the admiral and droid pro weren&#8217;t really treated like showcase devices. <br />
Here&#8217;s your chance RIM</p>
<p>I gotta be honest, the DVP has gotten every important update so far, and as the bulk goes, other phones feel weird to me now.  Like if I let go they&#8217;ll float away&#8230;</p>
<p>I had a DVP from it&#8217;s release, and thankfully just got rid of it for the Lumia 900. I didn&#8217;t think it was bulky until I got the 900. Support was horrible. It took like 3-4 months for them to release an update that allowed use of WiFi without taking the battery out every 10 min (it was a widely known bug). Also I was always the last in line to get updates compared to everyone else. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it was a good phone, but it kinda sucked.</p>
<p>How much better is the 900? Really, I&#8217;m gonna miss having a keyboard&#8230;</p>
<p>I have a 900 now, and my girlfriend has a DVP. When she first saw it, she said  &#8220;wow i really like that screen&#8221;, guess it was the first thing she noticed. But honestly comparing the two, even coming from someone that was a hardware keyboard addict (8125, tilt, fuze, tilt 2) i can say the lumia is really an all around better phone.<br />
The one thing that really peeved me about the DVP, is the lack of support for it. There&#8217;s hardly been any firmware updates for it. They initial updates they did last year were only because the phones had so many problems. But on top of that, there&#8217;s nothing in the marketplace from Dell in terms of apps either. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s an off contract phone, from an OEM that only cares about enterprise customers and not regular consumers. Plus customer service was terrible when trying to get a replacement earlier this year.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t exactly pinpoint it, but the 900 is <strong>such</strong> a better experience all around, like I feel like the OS is somehow more improved (even though I know it&#8217;s the same). I got the DVP for it&#8217;s keyboard and was really worried about going to a 100% touch keyboard. There are certainly times when I wish (and sometimes even try&#8230;.) I could slide out a keyboard with longer emails and stuff, but it isn&#8217;t as much of a burden as I thought. I&#8217;m getting used to it and I think it&#8217;s a worth while tradeoff to keep things thin. Highly recommend the Lumia 900</p>
<p>&#8230; and for good reason. It looks awful. (That is just my opinion, maybe others find it looks nice?)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a nice (logical) move to accomodate and please the current user base :) Seems like a plan for a smooth transition.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the &#8220;swiping-up&#8221; method, I think there&#8217;s a lot of ways to achieve the same desired results on a Blackberry device with a physical keyboard along with a touch screen.</p>
<p>Devices with a keyboard but comes without a touchscreen, something like the following is definitely doable (assuming the same word prediction logic is bundled):</p>
<p>As the user is typing, for example, if suggested word starts with the letter &#8220;t&#8221; (as triggered by the user), another immediate sequential input of the same letter, in this case, &#8220;t&#8221;,  would confirms the use of the suggested word. I guess that could work quite well. Two key stroke as opposed to one tap and a swipe gesture on a device with a touch screen.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m excited to see where RIM is heading with what they&#8217;re doing. If they managed to become competitive again (hopefully very soon), we as consumers will benefit from this, naturally :D</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>But what if you&#8217;re typing &#8216;battery&#8217; and the phone is suggesting &#8216;batch&#8217;?<br />
Wouldn&#8217;t it autocorrect when you hit the &#8220;t&#8221; twice?</p>
<p>Auto-correct have always worked that way on most platforms. It&#8217;s the current limitation or rather a self-imposed lack of efficiency due to the current set of logic in use in word  prediction/auto-correct.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve stated in my comment earlier that it needs to be an immediate sequential input of the same character.</p>
<p>The situation you&#8217;ve mentioned occurs everyday on any mobile device with word prediction. We skip or ignore (those who don&#8217;t have the feature turned off) the suggested word by (depending on the platform) pressing backspace once, and continue writing (which breaks the immediate sequential input&quot; where now the user (following your example) will be on &#8220;ba&#8221; where the next word suggested will based on words that starts with &#8220;ba&#8221; and a sequential &quot;a &quot; in this case will confirm the use of the suggested word such as &#8220;back&#8221; or &#8220;batch&#8221;. It goes on and on.</p>
<p>Another take on skipping the suggested word would be a timeout (in ms) for the expected sequential keystroke where (for example) a half-a-second pause would break the sequential input. I guess this is a possible solution as generally, stroking the same key on a physical keyboard is far from a challenge to the mass although an input or system-wide lag would not make this approach works as intended. A lot of ways, yeah :D</p>
<p>To improve the experience, an implementation of a stack containing underlying logic (along with exceptions) such as predictions based on context of the sentence and et cetera would be neat :D Auto-correct and word-prediction still require a lot of work. It seems simple but underneath, it&#8217;ll surprise most people and it&#8217;s very interesting too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there&#8217;s a more intuitive mechanics, especially with the people in the field working full time on this and I (highly) doubt that it&#8217;s gonna be with me coming up with suggested solution while writing a comment here :)</p>
<p>its not auto correct to select the word it&#8217;s suggesting you swipe up to use it if you want to not use it you continue typing check out the videos on crackberry.com for a detailed explanation</p>
<p>This is a sub-discussion on physical keyboards, which don&#8217;t allow one to &#8216;swipe up&#8217;.</p>
<p>It sounds like an interesting concept, but I am unsure whether this is actually practical. I have been using Swype now for a while, which is a lot better for me than other keyboards. However, previously, while typing, I would concentrate more on completing the words, and we all know more or less where the letters are on the keyboard. So I cannot imagine squinting at the keyboard after every letter to see if I can swipe up to auto-complete&#8230; I think just typing and using Auto-Complete would be faster than this.</p>
<p>I and a lot of people still want a physical keyboard. BB Storm form factor but a modern OS and hardware. Best of both worlds.</p>
<p>This is what I want. Im tired of onscreen keyboards. Android ruined it for me&#8230;</p>
<p>The real question is this: will existing devices get the upgrade to the new OS?</p>
<p>No.  And frankly, this question was answered a good year ago.</p>
<p>I can think of one way a keyboard BB could roughly duplicate the soft-keyboard functionality, and if RIM is actually working on this it could be a game-changer: keyboard with capacitive key-tops that can register gestures.</p>
<p>Exactly what blackberry needs, to stay away from the apps that everybody is using&#8230;</p>
<p>Can we POSSIBLY maintain objectivity?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s wrong with RIM adding filtering features to their camera/image editing tool? Android has the same thing built in.</p>
<p>You want to talk about objectivity? How about the fact this is an operating system that wont be released for another year while the other 3 do their big updates this year. How about the fact that the only way to know it even exists is through 2 years of press releases and YouTube videos. THAT is why BB is getting so much flak.</p>
<p>Name one thing that BB is bringing to the table that no one else is. Name one thing that makes waiting until 2013 so worth jumping on the blackberry bandwagon.</p>
<p>Thorsten Heins isn&#8217;t even sure of his own product. &#8220;I think we will reinstall faith in RIM.&#8221;<br />
I think? How does that assure anyone?</p>
<p>Son! What in T.H.E hell are you talking about?</p>
<p>How does anything you said relate to my response to the gentleman above my initial comment?</p>
<p>In your entire, long winded and completely unnecessary post you argued with yourself. I never claimed RIM would be successful in their future endeavors, I never said Thorsten Heins was reassuring anyone. You created this whole thing in your head. Unless you believe in Inception and that I&#8217;m Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>

<p>What is this BlackBerry 10 that everybody keeps talking about for the last 2 years?</p>
<p>It is an OS a particular company called RIM has been working on for their mobile devices arm called Blackberry.     /s</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be a douche, dude. Your statement tries to discredit the value of the news that was reported in this post. We all know BB and RIM in general is struggling (to say the least) but at the very least don&#8217;t dis the news being put out here by acting like it&#8217;s worthless because &#8220;you don&#8217;t recognize this BB 10 that everybody keeps talking about&#8221;.</p>
<p>More info here: <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2991517/blackberry-10-a-closer-look-video" target="_blank">http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2991517/blackberry-10-a-closer-look-video</a></p>
<p>So first they try and make their own Siri (fail badly)  now they try and take on Instagram? Why couldn&#8217;t they just get the app for the os</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;re not actually this stupid and the comment is a joke. You know what beta means right?</p>
<p>Of course I know it was a joke!</p>
<p>Yes, because this will save them! All they need is photo filters and they&#8217;ll be safe for 10 years in terms of innovation</p>

<p>Yes, because this is the only thing that they have announced with BB10. It isn&#8217;t like they have also been showing off a new user interface or a ton of new features. Nothing like the new keyboard that by all accounts is awesome or a camera app where you can actually roll back sections of the picture.</p>
<p>Clearly this is the only thing that they are banking on.</p>
<p>A major part of the draw for Instagram is the social-networking side of it, just being able to filter photos isn&#8217;t anything new, and without the existing userbase they will find it pretty hard to challenge it.</p>
<p>Not a major part. The major part. Without the social side of Instagram, no one would particularly care.</p>
<p>Especially since both iOS and Android offer similar built-in functionality.</p>
<p>Personally I couldn&#8217;t care less about the social side of Instagram, they do offer arguably the best filters of any app I have tried.  I have searched far and wide for anything comparable on my WP7.  I just want cool filters and I can see all my friends filtered photos on facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;The RIMpire Strikes Back&#8221;?</p>
<p>Haha!</p>
<p>i didnt know blackberry still made phone haha</p>
<p>Last throes.</p>
<p>Ummm, really?</p>
<p>Every phone has built in filtering. Blackberry thinks they&#8217;re going to take on Instagram? Ha.</p>
<p>(HTC Incredible Owner)</p>
<p>No The Verge says they are trying to take on instagram.</p>
<p>Um.. Instagram isn&#8217;t about the filters, it&#8217;s about the network..</p>
<p>This b tbitbwint stop the haters</p>
<p>I just want filters!!! My built in WP7 filters are totally meh.</p>
<p>This comment gave me douche chills.</p>
<p>BlackBerry is tring so hard to be cool that it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>If you dont get instgram or hate it then you must be real old or real young or some foreigner,</p>
<p>When you can&#8217;t even align the clock correctly on the top bar even on alpha stage, you should stop pretending your going to revolutionize the phone&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>When you can&#8217;t even realize that this is on purpose, you should stop pretending to make any significant comment&#8230;</p>
<p>So what RIM. By the time you actually release BB10, no one will care enough to buy it. Give us something completely different from the other 3 phone OS&#8217;s. At this point in the game you either need to really wow the us as consumers, to get us to switch or give it up. Hell HP sorta figured this one out.</p>
<p>Arguably we have seen very little of the actual OS, just a few features so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;BlackBerry 10 to take on Instagram with built-in photo filtering&#8221;</p>
<p>First they need to take on themselves.</p>
<p>There are so many pictures that could benefit from some form editing and manipulation before being posted, so I find this quite enabling. It&#8217;s not only about having a feature, it&#8217;s also about how you integrate it but I&#8217;m happy to see more features than less.</p>
<p>I really wish at this point, 6 months before launch, that RIM would start releasing some videos to showcase the features in a more attractive and professional way.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unbelievable how out of touch with everything RIM is. People don&#8217;t use Instagram for the filters, every phone&#8217;s had those forever. People use Instagram for the giant billion dollar social network attached to the pictures.</p>
<p>The Verge, specifically Louis Goddard are the only ones claiming that RIM will &#8220;take on&#8221; instagram.  Without the misleading article headline this is basically RIM adding features to their new OS.  I for one don&#8217;t have instagram cause I&#8217;m on WP7 and most of their native filters blow, so an app with nice filters is nice, if good ones come on the phone great.  Most my friends who have instagram post their pics to facebook anyway&#8230;</p>
<p>lol good luck</p>
<p>I want Rimm  to succeed , but judging by their track record something tells me that bb10 is going to flop big time. <strong>hopefully I&#8217;m wrong</strong></p>
<p>Because there will be no port of Instagram to BB10</p>
<p>Awesome sum up of all that happened with BB today. Great work, hope those kind of live debates will follow in the future after major mobile events.</p>
<p>I missed this live debate but it was really interesting. Thanks!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a real shame that RIM is in charge of the QNX kernel. The Playbook OS is probably one of the finest OSes I&#8217;ve ever used on a tablet (if not the best OS) as it has supreme multitasking capabilities by stealing all of the best UI from WebOS but being much faster and much more stable.</p>
<p>But RIM is so god damn dog slow at properly utilizing what they purchased.</p>
<p>Palm had zero cash flow and heavy debt and hence they succumbed, RIM on the other hand has a positive cash flow, zero debt and $2.1 billion in the bank, they are competing for 3rd spot and they are capable looking at the acquitions they made in the last couple of years</p>
<blockquote>The Playbook OS is probably one of the finest OSes I’ve ever used on a tablet (if not the best OS)</blockquote>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sOVE6.gif" /></p>
<p>Supreme multitasking? It closes apps in the background all the time for no good reason; it&#8217;s worse than WP7. When switching between apps you never know if the app is to the right or to the left.<br />
Stable? The Android Player often won&#8217;t start at all. Text editing is pretty unpredictable as well.</p>
<p>you can&#8217;t be that dumb and still post a comment on the verge. enable the showcase mode in the multitasking settings on the playbook.</p>
<p>You think its good that they stole they UI from WebOS? I think its lazy and terrible</p>
<p>This will be RIM&#8217;s Pre 3&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, and this time, it will be an even bigger battle uphill (for RIM) than it was in the case of HP&#8217;s WebOS. WebOS came at a time when BB and Symbian were falling, and Android was weak, both in terms of features and ecosystem. Still, WebOS didn&#8217;t succeed so much.</p>
<p>Today, not only are iOS and Android secure at the top spots, but the battle for #3 is also becoming intense, with WP7 running for it. If BB10 comes by the end of the year, it will have an ecosystem even worse than WP7&#8217;s, and will have to compete with iOS 6, Android 5.0 and WP8, all at the same time.</p>
<p>Will it survive after all the bloodshed? Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Wait, why will it have an ecosystem that&#8217;s worst than WP7? Are you going to say because it&#8217;s newer and hasn&#8217;t been out as long? Well keep in mind that BB10 is essentially PlayBook Tablet OS, which has been out for more than a year. They just passed 70k apps and are nearing WP7 in app count. They can potentially pass WP7 here. They already have a greater marketshare in smartphones anyways.</p>
<p>RIM will release more developers kits at BlackBerry World next week as well and I expect more big name app announcements.</p>
<p>if you think the Blackberry App store has enough apps to compete with Windows Phone, you are so delusional that I wouldn&#8217;t even argue the point with you. The Playbook app store is the most barren app store out there. It is stupid to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Windows Phone has Netflix and Skype, I&#8217;ll give it that. However, RIM has most of the big name games. They even got Angry Birds Space while WP7 still doesn&#8217;t have it. For non-game apps, RIM will be releasing their Cascades UI framework where apps like Netflix and Skype can be released. BlackBerry App World is missing some key apps but it&#8217;s by no means &#8220;barren&#8221;.</p>
<p>ahhhh&#8230;. &#8220;coming soon&#8221;. The mating call of Palm.</p>
<p>Try 3 days for Cascades UI. We may even see some big name apps released. I&#8217;m curious on which apps on Windows Marketplace are available that makes BlackBerry App World so barren to you?</p>
<p>I wanna hear this too&#8230;.</p>
<p><img src="http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/op-will-surely-deliver-lets-just-wait.jpg" /></p>
<p>Nice try Thorsten :-)</p>
<p>The Windows Phone store is pretty barren as well.</p>
<p>you haven&#8217;t used Playbook or seen it&#8217;s App store lately, it will surprise you and is better than the Windows Phone. talk about games like NFL, Deadspace, Angry birds, cut the rope, plant vs zoombies, rdp clients, dropbox, media clients, magazine stores are all there on the playbook. Netflix is a mute point because playbook can handle media namely flash, html5 better than any other platform out there. Skype is kept out and is a matter of corporate politics.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be pissed if my Netflix was mute.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be more pissed off if my Netflix was <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/moot" target="new">of little or no practical value or meaning; purely academic</a>.</p>
<p>Palm had zero cash flow and heavy debt and hence they succumbed, RIM on the other hand has a positive cash flow, zero debt and $2.1 billion in the bank, there is a room for other players in the Mobile market (the future as we know is only the smartphones exist and the world has what 100 billion population? and in a way we are at the infancy of the post PC era )and IMO RIM still has a chance if they execute BB10 well.</p>
<p>This looks like an iphone 4&#8230;</p>
<p>you smoking crack? that dwarfs that hand, instead of the hand dwarfing the phone</p>
<p>Fine, it looks like a Galaxy SII. Happy?</p>
<p>soooo you&#8217;re saying it looks like any phone that looks like a slate&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>It looks like a Nokia N9! What? It&#8217;s black!</p>
<p>To me it looks like a Droid X</p>
<p>any phone thats rectangular without rounded edges looks like an iphone <del>____</del></p>
<p>and its a developer device</p>
<p>No. HTCs don&#8217;t, Motorolas don&#8217;t, Nokias don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This. Only Apple and Samsung make the generic candy bar black front phone designs. HTC, Nokia, and Motorola come up with their own fabulous shit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not very &#8220;generic&#8221; if only two companies do so, and one of them copied the other.</p>
<p>I agree, can&#8217;t believe Apple copied Samsung&#8217;s designs</p>
<p>&#8230;.. Not sure if&#8230; sarcastic&#8230; or&#8230;&#8230;humorous.. or&#8230; &#8230;.??&#8230;. &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>lol :P</p>
<p><img src="http://www.kitchencontraptions.com/pictures/41R37L2CQFL._AA300_.jpg" /></p>
<p>iPhone 4 cooking!</p>
<p>This phone looks good, if they can hurry up and put some development behind it and release more than a few handsets.  Also RIM phones are heavy, they need to lighten them up some, and slim them down</p>
<p>The bold 9900 is 130g and 10.5 mm thick. The iPhone 4s is 140g and 9.3mm thick. I don&#8217;t think the form factor is the real issue. I do agree that they need to work on their timeliness when releasing new products though, that&#8217;s definitely killing them right now.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a HUGE bezel. Especially for a phone that doesn&#8217;t appear to have any physical buttons on its face.</p>
<p>This is a developer device, not final hardware. The way this looks (assuming this is real) is not necessarily indicative of what will ultimately ship to customers.</p>
<p>As an example, take a look at this line up of developer hardware for the 6th console generation:<br />
<img src="http://images.wikia.com/vgsales/images/e/ef/Sixth_gen_dev_kits.png" /></p>
<p>Also, BB10 (or QNX, BlackBerry Tablet OS, whatever) is extremely gesture heavy.  I mean that in a good way.</p>
<p>I wanted one of these Green xbox badges SO BAD.</p>
<p>FYI, the Xbox dev box was actually an Apple PowerMac G5.</p>
<p>source: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/1686/5">http://www.anandtech.com/show/1686/5</a> <em>(scroll to the bottom)</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s hilarious</p>
<p>The Xb0x 360 dev box was a PowerMac G5. The original Xbox&#8217;s dev box was presumably a normal Pentium III PC, since that&#8217;s what the Xbox 1 is.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this, some people just can&#8217;t read at all.</p>
<p>You need bezels for the Playbook OS/BB10. Bezel gestures, son.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing the bezel will also be touch sensitive just like the PlayBook.</p>
<p>Oh hey, it&#8217;s the &#8216;Apple Killer&#8217; 2.0. Blackberry Storm, we hardly knew ye.</p>
<p>Looks gd&#8230;love how bb devices look</p>
<p>Why won&#8217;t they turn it on!!!!???</p>
<p>My concern about RIM releasing a device like this can be summed up as: why should anyone buy this?  If RIM stuck with the classic Blackberry portrait keyboard look, or even a slider like the Torch, I can see RIM carving a niche for itself among a certain type of user who likes that setup.</p>
<p>But if RIM just releases a buttonless black slab, why will anyone buy one of these things when the iPhone and scads of Android devices will offer superior functionality (and it will be superior; there&#8217;s no way that BB10 1.0 will be as sophisticated or stable as iOS or Android 4.0) along with an infinitely superior ecosystem?  My question is simple: what features can RIM offer that will entice a customer to pass up excellent devices running established operating systems like the iPhone, the One X, and the Galaxy S III?</p>
<p>I really hope that RIM has an answer to that question; otherwise, this really is just RIM&#8217;s Pre 3.  I think RIM makes fantastic hardware, so I want to see them succeed, but if all they have to offer is &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like an iPhone but way worse,&#8221; I&#8217;m not optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;My concern about RIM releasing a device like this&#8221;</p>
<p>This particular device will never be released, though they may release something similar so I see your point.</p>
<p>Right.  The <strong>look</strong> of the device isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;m talking about.  It&#8217;s the specifications of the hardware, and particularly its total similarity to the iPhone and a bevy of Android phones, that&#8217;s the problem.  The final consumer device will no doubt be quite sleek, but it&#8217;ll likely still be a touchscreen slab.</p>
<p>Yeah, why would anyone buy a development device that&#8217;s not even finalized hardware?</p>
<p>Um they are called developers&#8230; just putting it out there&#8230; maybe&#8230; just maybe&#8230; so that they can develop.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the average consumer.</p>
<p>That was sarcasm.  <em>I hope.</em></p>
<p>Also, for the record, the only way you could buy this is second-hand from a developer (illegally).  Anyone who gets one of these from RIM won&#8217;t need to pay a dime (outside of whatever indirect fees required to be a registered developer and to attend the BlackBerry Jam conference).</p>
<p>Your sarcasm meter ain&#8217;t defective.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love RIM be able to come back but I really can&#8217;t see them winning their market share back in the near to mid term. They need to create a game-changing device, they will never win with a me-too-device, especially with the way the brand is tarnishing in North America.</p>
<p>They need to do a ground-up re-invention, re-inventing the iPhone or Android won&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>If anything, they&#8217;re re-inventing webOS.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230; there’s no way that BB10 1.0 will be as sophisticated or stable as iOS or Android 4.0&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Have you ever used a BlackBerry PlayBook?  If so, was it running the latest version of the OS? If not, try not to make too many assumptions. Although I&#8217;m an owner/user of an absurd amount mobile devices, I still find the OS on the PlayBook to be superior to <em>any</em> other mobile OS I&#8217;ve tried. To be clear, I&#8217;m strictly speaking about operating systems here here, not the ecosystems available therein. App availability on QNX is nothing less than non-competitive at this point in time. To put this into perspective, here are <em>some</em> of the mobile devices I currently own:</p>
<p>• Motorola XOOM 4G, <br />
• Apple iPad (2nd and 3rd gen.), <br />
• HP TouchPad, <br />

<p>These are just the devices I&#8217;ve picked up in the last two years (not including much older devices like the Apple MessagePad 2000).  In other words, <em>I have a problem</em>. In <em>other</em> other words, I&#8217;ve put in enough time with different mobile operating systems to have some level authority on each in comparison to one another.</p>
<p>QNX, at its current stage, is plenty competive as a mobile operating system.  Where it falters is its ecosystem (or lack thereof), which is arguably the most important aspect of <em>any</em> operating system. Unfortunately, this aspect of the OS isn&#8217;t likely to change or improve until it has a much greater rate of adoption, which in turn is unlikely to improve until it has a greater ecosystem.  It&#8217;s a bit of an <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Ouroboros-simple.svg">Ouroboros</a> type situation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all I&#8217;m trying to say is to not knock it until you&#8217;ve taken the time to try it.</p>
<p>QNX is a fabulous operating system and is implemented impressively on the Playbook. I kept wishing my Galaxy Nexus and iPhone 4S were capable of running PB OS 2.0.</p>
<p>I just hope that the BB10 phones have a resolution of at least the Galaxy Nexus pixel density. Anything less and I can&#8217;t consider it.</p>
<p>i have blackberry playbook and it makes me want to kill myself.</p>
<p>Might want to sort your life out.</p>
<p>Oooh, a generic black slate. RIM&#8217;s flagship should ALWAYS have a hardware keyboard, that&#8217;s their only really differentiator now that iMessage exists(do people use it though?). I wish they had waited a year and done the torch right, that&#8217;s the kind of form factor I want see out of them.</p>
<p>I hear people at school talking about iMessage actually, so I think that they really should stick a keyboard on this. :/</p>
<p>Looks a year old with probably a wvga 800&#215;480 screen. This isn&#8217;t 2010 but this a just a early model so I&#8217;ll take it with a bit of caution. Still not revolutionary yet imo.</p>
<p>TI OMAP dual-core CPU clocked anywhere from 1.2GHz to 1.5GHz, 1GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage with an 8MP rear camera and a 2MP front facing camera with a 1024 &#215; 600 display.</p>
<p>Pretty nice.</p>
<p>RIM has never had the greatest cameras on their devices. I&#8217;m hoping they finally make it a priority. 1280 &#215; 720 is the new smartphone minimum for anything besides an iPhone, which has a pretty tiny screen.</p>
<p>for a 4&quot; screen 1024 × 600 is good enough and I am not a fan of 4.7&quot;screens and I own a nexus which I hate to hold</p>
<p>I disagree. They used to have some of the best. I think once the iPhone 4 came out, that didn&#8217;t hold true anymore. My current Bold 9930 is a big downgrade since they used an EDOF camera instead of an autofocus. But previous BlackBerrys were among the best IMO.  I hope they go back to their old ways. The iPhone 4S takes excellent photos for a smartphone.</p>
<p>Also, 1280 &#215; 720 is definitely not a standard for smartphones. There are a handful of devices with this resolution but it&#8217;s not typical. There is evidence of a 1280 &#215; 768 resolution in PlayBook OS 2.0. If the BlackBerry London launches with a 4.3&quot; screen and 1280 &#215; 768, it will have the highest pixel density of any smartphone ever. I believe the highest currently are the Sony Xperia S and HTC Rezound.</p>
<p>I know it will at least have a 1024 &#215; 600 like the PlayBook which would still give it an excellent screen. We&#8217;ll find out in a few days.</p>
<p>Will The Verge have any staff on-site at BlackBerry World/BlackBerry Jam?</p>
<p>Maybe RIM should stick with low end and mid smartphones for a while, leave high-end to Apple, Samsung and HTC, even when many phone specs are getting less relevant between platforms, like GHz in Processors and Megapixel in Camera used to,</p>
<p>Too little, too late.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Looks like an iPhone in a case</p>
<p>Apparently everything looks like a goddamn iPhone. You people really have been brainwashed.</p>
<p>Not the same, but similar. That&#8217;s all. And what do you mean &#8220;you people&#8221;? I don&#8217;t have an iPhone and do like Android.</p>
<p>Playbook Mini.</p>
<p>So RIM goes back in time and pretend they had invented the iPhone.<br />
Remember when the iPhone first launched and RIM Execs were flabbergasted, stating that Apple&#8217;s 1.5 hr demo of the iPhone was &#8216;impossible&#8217; to do, and must have been faked. <a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/27/rim-apple-iphone-unveiled-2007/" target="_blank">http://www.intomobile.com/2010/12/27/rim-apple-iphone-unveiled-2007/</a></p>
<p>More like you had to go back in time to dig some completely useless and unrelated stuff for the sake of making a cheap pass at this&#8230;</p>
<p>Or, you know, they plan to make BB10 as awesome as Playbook OS 2.0. The device isn&#8217;t even on; it&#8217;s a bit early to pass judgement.</p>
<p>just a miniaturized playbook. fear that it&#8217;s success might be miniaturized too. just imagine it, bb10 having less success than the playbook.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s like dividing by zero &#8212; figuratively <em>and</em> literally.</p>
<p>The Playbook is fantastic with the OS update. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s a miniature Playbook with a higher quality display.</p>
<p>man, you sure hate &#8217;em bad. you want them dead at the start line. :)</p>
<p>i also don&#8217;t think anyone outside the business-section who feel dedicated to BB Products would buy these over iOS, Andriod and WP Devices.<br />
It&#8217;s sad though :-(</p>
<p>Honestly, I wish they took some of the aesthetics from the Bold and applied them to this device. They have a decent design team, and its a shame they&#8217;re playing it so safe. If BlackBerry wants to get out of the hole they&#8217;ve dug themselves into, they need to do something drastic. Its time to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I agree. The 9900 Bold has one of the most aesthetically pleasing designs next to some phones like the iPhone and HTC One X imo. I wouldn&#8217;t judge this device in design when it&#8217;s only an alpha device. Even so, if this thing has similar qualities to the PlayBook (which it looks like it does), expect high quality glass and a magnesium alloy frame.</p>
<p>Screw it, I want one. Don&#8217;t care if everyone else is hating on RIM.</p>
<p>Seconded.</p>
<p>I hope this isn&#8217;t indicative of where RIM is going with the final hardware. It&#8217;s by no means ugly, but still pretty bland compared to the concepts that we&#8217;ve seen so far (admittedly I&#8217;m not certain whether these have been confirmed as coming out of RIM). The Blade especially looks really, really nice IMO &#8211; reminds me a lot of the Venue Pro, actually, both in the obvious slider parallel and some of the smaller details.</p>

<p>Oh Dear.  I honestly hate to say this, but this device looks like a cross between an iPhone and a Galaxy Phone.  I really hope RIM doesn&#8217;t get sued up the ass for this design?</p>
<p>It looks like a tiny Playbook. The matte back is more similar to what HTC produces.</p>
<p>Getting my BlackBerry Playbook was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I love the OS, and I need all the apps I need for studying so I don&#8217;t really mind. There are still some things to work out though, like the memory issues and the seemingly random crashes of my e-mail app. However, the fact that it can run youtube 1080p videos, alongside me doing some light gaming while reviewing my notes from lecture whilst running on a 1Ghz dual-core processor just shows how powerful the OS is. I&#8217;m still not sure if I&#8217;ll jump into the whole BlackBerry brand as I love my Optimus 7. But my introduction to the Playbook has given me some serious thoughts of jumping ship. I want RIM to succeed. Better competition = better choices for consumers!</p>
<p>This phone looks like an LG G2x</p>
<p>Too little too late?</p>
<p>Hopefully this is just a development device because it looks like every other black slab of a phone out there. BB has little to differentiate itself from Android slabs and iPhones out there. Yet another touch screen OS.</p>
<p>Its a nice looking device, but I think its going to be the final nail in the RIM coffin.</p>
<p>another iphone clone</p>
<p>Looks good hopefully the one that gets to the consumers has a keyboard&#8230;</p>

<p>lol</p>
<p>lol Blackberry&#8230;..</p>
<p>Sounds like a Google patent buying spree&#8230;. pennies on the dollar no less</p>
<p>So they are going to keep selling gimped phones while selling um&#8230;less gimped phones? I dunno. It&#8217;s almost like RIM is a parody of itself at this point. A joke company.</p>
<p>The biggest and most unknown tragedy about RIM&#8217;s complete nosedive is the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. It&#8217;s a research facility in Waterloo that was started by a massive initial donation in 2000 by Mike Lazaridis. RIM has been a significant contributor to them since. They do a lot of cutting-edge, interesting research there, and the people are great, and while I&#8217;m sure the centre will continue regardless, they&#8217;re going to lose a huge source of funding because RIM is too frakking stupid to see that they are moving too slow to targets that are already too old.</p>
<p>So when are going to lower the prices on the 9900/9930?</p>
<p>Good question!</p>
<p>Whoa! Slow down Thorsten, you don&#8217;t want to be too innovative again.</p>
<p>BB10 &#8211; too late. Nobody cares</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really like they really have a choice..</p>
<p>It&#8217;s either; <br />
A. Keep pushing their outdated devices while their engineers put in long hours <strike>creating the next great blackberry phone</strike> sending resumes out and planning relocation strategies to silicon valley.</p>
<p>- or -</p>
<p>B. Open up a lemonade stand in front of their HQ and try to raise money that way.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to this world than silicon valley you know. But I just don&#8217;t understand that latest novelty supremacy rationale, it&#8217;s spurious. Some people do enjoy what these products offer. The news was some devices did well outside the continental US. Your joke is tiny.</p>
<blockquote>Your joke is tiny.</blockquote>
<p>No, RIM&#8217;s market valuation is tiny.</p>
<p>My joke was massive! Probably among the larger ever witnessed on the Verge.</p>
<p>You probably just didn&#8217;t get it because you&#8217;re not from God&#8217;s America.</p>
<p>boom! yeah, that just happened.</p>
<p>Now I hear you!</p>
<p>Those 4 people will be thrilled I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good and pretty obvious strategy &#8211; at least it&#8217;s much better than Nokia saying &#8220;OK, Symbian is DEAD, long live WP7&#8230;but we won&#8217;t actually have a WP7 phone until 15 months from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, RIM should&#8217;ve done this when BB 6-7 were still at their high point, and in parallel they should&#8217;ve released something like QNX/BB10 for their touchscreen phones.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s perfect time to jump into the future. You don&#8217;t need hardware keyboards to woo consumers. Enough time with on screen keyboards and you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell the difference. RIM needs to take the Microsoft approach and just leave what&#8217;s in the past in the damn past (as far as phones go)</p>
<p>&#8220;RIM needs to take the Microsoft approach and just leave what’s in the past in the damn past (as far as phones go)&#8221;</p>
<p>Ouch, that&#8217;s a pretty harsh assesment of leaving Windows Phone 7 users behind!</p>
<p>BB10 needed to be here five years ago, I want it out NOW so it and Windows Phone can scrap over third</p>
<p>Nor a future.<br />
(oh no he didn&#8217;t)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s RIM been doing for the past 2 years? It seems they&#8217;re waiting for something. It was LTE chips with reasonable battery life but that&#8217;s already been released (s4). Maybe they&#8217;re waiting for some sort of agreement with Google for android apps?</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s RIM been doing for the past 2 years?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.</p>
<p>RIM needs to ditch BBOS and offer its users the option of installing Android 4.1 or Windows Phone 8. The company excels with hardware design and function, but it&#8217;s really bad with the software it installs on its hardware. Business people would freak out for a BB WP8 handset with all the BB perks.</p>
<p>This is honestly the worst idea I have ever heard.  I don&#8217;t know much about you, but I can guarentee you have never and will never be in a position to make major financial decisions for a company.  Seriously, RIM would be better off selling off it&#8217;s components than adopting Android.  WP8 would have about a 1:1000 chance of working positively for them, but that is obviously still a very bad idea.  They just spend years and billions of dollars on BB10 and it is only a few months from release.  Why in gods name would they want to adopt a different OS?  Especially since anyone that has used the PlayBook agrees that the OS is pretty damn fluid and has a TON of potential.</p>
<p>Wait, so of the last generation of BB phones only the full touch screen one is discontinued.  So, in the future, lets make more of those.</p>
<p>I just want to say now, before tons of people comment with WTF RIM SUCKS reactions&#8230; RIM has ALWAYS said this was the case. They will introduce the first BB10 device without a hardware keyboard. It&#8217;s not news. They have said this since day 1.</p>
<p>This is quite stupid, Excellent keyboard is one of RIM key selling point, and must have for phone that primarily used and famous for it texting abilities</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind having one if they had invested time into making the software more reliable.</p>
<p>If you actually want people to buy your phones, then you don&#8217;t put a keyboard on it. Simple as that. RIM knows they need to sell something before they can start catering to the half dozen people who like keyboards again.</p>
<p>Releasing a phone with a keyboard as their first next gen phone would have been hilarious, and also the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>This only applies to the first device (which may not even be the only device) launched. It makes perfect sense to promote BB10&#8217;s touchscreen chops and then introduce keyboard versions for the faithful.</p>
<p>It can no longer be considered a selling point when everyone but the most change resistant people (a.k.a. too scared, lazy, or dumb to learn something new) are no longer buying RIM products.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but just because someone prefers to pump out long business related emails and text messages on a secure phone with the best keyboard doesn&#8217;t make them &#8220;scared, lazy, or dumb&#8221; as you so ignorantly put it.</p>
<p>In fact, some of those people have owned and used full touch screen Android devices and iPhones and STILL chose to go back to their keyboards.</p>
<p>How is this news? This has been the plan for BB10 for a long time&#8230;</p>
<p>I would like to see RIM produce a phone like the Motorola Droid. Where the keyboard slides in and out from behind the screen.</p>
<p>They have that, it&#8217;s called Torch 9810.</p>
<p>No not like that. Like the Droid.</p>
<p>They said this is what they&#8217;ll do the day they announced BB10. How is this news??</p>
<p>The keyboard was the only reason I briefly considered a blackberry.</p>
<p>They will still have a physical keyboard. Just not as the first BB10 phone.</p>
<p>This is a stupid move. Nobody buys blackberry because of the OS. They buy it because of the keyboard, or BES integration (for businesses).</p>
<p>Neither of the features listed above will be with the first BB10 devices. Which begs the question, who is RIM trying to sell to?</p>
<p>People do buy BlackBerry phones because of the OS. Apps are not the only important thing in an OS. Also, BB10 is a completely new OS and we don&#8217;t know yet how good it will be.</p>
<p>And BES will still exist by the way.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why RIM should ditch BBOS in favor for the WP8 or Android 4.1. Better yet, give users the option to the OS of their choice  before/after purchase.</p>
<p>They have a new OS. QNX, and it&#8217;s going to be awesome.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned and used BlackBerrys, Androids, and most recently the iPhone, and the OS I find to be the most useful for the important features was the BBOS.  Apps aside, BBOS allows for the most integration and fluidness of the key components.</p>
<p>Oh no! What are all the 55+ business douches  going to do? I hope they at least have a killer belt clip accessory for them to compensate.</p>
<p>They announced this at the general session at BB10 Jam in Orlando May 1st&#8230;</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t look bad&#8230;it&#8217;s just too late. Sorry RIM, but this should have been what BlackBerry 7 was.</p>
<p>&#8220;too late&#8221;? nay. Of course it would be waaay better for RIM if they would have created BB10 2-3 years ago but still if the device and OS will be good they have their chances. For 100% they won&#8217;t be the number one but the exit rate will for sure will be lower (or even they will get many new customers)</p>
<p>The Astonishing Tribe is pulling a big load here. They&#8217;ve got the skills and vision to take on the competition for BB. Just look at their concepts, they&#8217;re insane. Also the latest presentations on the go app along the meeting mode displayed here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQMTqN1jTMg" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQMTqN1jTMg</a>, are unbelievably awesome and way beyond what others are doing.</p>
<p>I agree TAT has amazing skills&#8230; Some of the concept they do are great. Even the apps made by TAT like the Scarpbook app for the PlayBook is awesome. Those guys know design&#8230; BTW I think they are called RIM Sweden. The Astonishing Tribe sounds alot better. Can&#8217;t wait for BB10.</p>
<p>I love TAT, when RIM acquired them it was a very bittersweet moment for me as I want RIM to succeed and TAT could really help them there but as I had just switched from a BB to Android I was using some of their live wallpapers and they were endlessly entertaining. But with newer versions of Android they no longer work :( All this to say that I agree and think TAT has elite level programming and design skills to really lift BB up.</p>
<p>I know TAT ;) I even had the pleasure to speak with some guys from TAT (before RIM went with new CEO) and they told me that they have big problems with seniors in RIM to convince them for their designs (they even had to put &#8220;evangelist&#8221; teams for their designs ;) ) but as we see the change of the CEO helped them :)</p>
<p>Exactly. With features like this corporations and government departments already with BB will more favourably consider upgrading to BB10 rather than shifting to iOS (or Android).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still fearful the other shoe will drop and it&#8217;ll be announced you can only use these features while holding a Lazaridis statuette&#8230;</p>
<p>Seems they&#8217;re really trying to change&#8230;. err&#8230; wake up.</p>

<p>Oh, this is simply on page 3 of the source link forum thread. Sorry.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link. That app UI looks a LOT like iOS with Holo theme from ICS.</p>
<p>Wake Up&#8230;.and look at an app that looks exactly like an iOS app.<br />
Screen sharing might be cool, but it&#8217;s so boring to see them bag Apple and then copy them and Android and webOS and WP.</p>
<p>And Apple&#8217;s pull down menu is original huh&#8230;</p>
<p>Yes, and I mentioned that they also copied others. Your comment is irrelevant and you obviously didn&#8217;t read the full comment, but okay then.</p>
<p>But that app looks exactly like an iOS and sort of like an Android app running on a phone that will not have the same ecosystem as Apple or Android, or even WP or webOS.</p>
<p>There are not many realistic ways to show info in a clear and easy to use way on a fullscreen phone so its bound to look similar.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going to convince somebody to change from a perfectly fine, secure and great business and consumer OS like iOS and Android, to now go to a Blackberry that doesn&#8217;t have an ecosystem and does nothing really that new.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good question but your claim about the security of iOS and Android lacks balance i.e. &#8220;secure&#8221; &#8211; there are outstanding issues in iOS like ARP leaks ( <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2012/03/anatomy-of-an-iphone-leak.ars" target="_blank">http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2012/03/anatomy-of-an-iphone-leak.ars</a> ) or contacts policy management by apps, as well as issues with some Google store app content, as discussed in the Trend Micro report on mobile OS security ( <a href="http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/business/reports/rpt_enterprise_readiness_consumerization_mobile_platforms.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/business/reports/rpt_enterprise_readiness_consumerization_mobile_platforms.pdf</a> ). It&#8217;s old news ok, but you said &#8220;secure&#8221;. In the enterprise, there might be existing assets which can be leveraged using an MDM solution like Mobile Fusion, which can manage iOS and Android devices too. As for apps, well with a clever financial incentive plan as the one RIM put in place, key apps might appear quite fast &#8211; and it&#8217;s really about key apps more than sheer number. As for the OS, well, as we don&#8217;t know all that much about it so you can&#8217;t really say that it does nothing new really, and the camera app and word prediction made a positive impression, and now we see bits of new features. A segment of the smartphone users might also like devices with physical keyboards and their needs may be catered to by RIM. Also you shouldn&#8217;t underestimate WP phones and MS. It&#8217;s an uphill battle for sure for anyone else in the market, but in the end some people might like doing things differently for all sorts of reasons ;-)</p>
<p>There are not many realistic platform choices besides Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Realistic? Aww u definitely do not know the power of blackberry encryption security. It&#8217;s sad people like to have a nice looking toy than a working tool! I hope you don&#8217;t change your mind when BB 10 comes out cuz it will make ios looks ancient with features and it&#8217;s is capabilities :) till then I think you should just enjoy playing some temple or angry birds lmao</p>
<p>I rather want a well-thought improved copy of a feature someone else has than trying to ram through something that doesn&#8217;t work well, just because it is different (different and working well is of course the ideal).<br />
This way we all get better systems regardless what ecosystem you&#8217;ve chosen.</p>
<p>If Apple were to do something like this call it &#8220;Magic Cast&#8221; everyone will be like WOW!!</p>
<p>I think this will bring people back to BlackBerry! I just knew they could do it!!!!!</p>
<p>By copying iOS, Android and other big mobile OS&#8217;s, like, 4 years after they made it?</p>
<p>IKR. They should just keep wallowing in their own jarate.</p>
<p>Remember the famous quote by Steve jobs? Great artists steal. <br />
Shamelessly copying each other has worked out nicely for google and apple so I have no problems with rim doing the same. If it works, it deserves to be in every os.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d switch to blackberry if they could create a better experience 90% of the time then android AND catch up with all the most important apps and have access to web apps for the rest or just use the browser for what I&#8217;d normally have an app. However it&#8217;s unlikely that RIM will be able to do that in it&#8217;s first generation, although I was considering a playbook at it&#8217;s heavily discounted prices when they allowed it to run or easily port android apps. If RIM can  price this low enough to compete with cheap Android handsets E.g.  cost price and just try to get it out there it might sell in enough volumes to persuade developers to support the platform. That&#8217;s a big if though and would require RIM to be able to burn through even more cash&#8230;.</p>
<p>BTW my perspective is as a smartphone user that thought before the playbook and even the iphone that RIM was generations behind. Not that I like the iphone but it did change things.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get what you said in your last paragraph.  Before the iPhone, BlackBerry&#8217;s competitors were PalmOS, Windows Mobile and Symbian.  Which of those was &#8220;generations ahead&#8221; of BlackBerry?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Palm fanboy (and wrote a couple of my own apps), but for sure they weren&#8217;t on fundamental OS (maybe a bit on UI and ease of use).  Windows Mobile had multitasking, but IMO worse memory and storage management.  Probably roughly equivalent UI.</p>
<p>I was also a Psion user before it turned to Symbian and wrote a couple of things for my own use there too.  Symbian was also roughly equivalent to BlackBerry in UI and OS.</p>
<p>None of them were even close on enterprise infrastructure.</p>
<p>Any competitors I missed?</p>
<p>I love the idea of screen sharing on a mobile device&#8230; if it were implemented in Skype on the iPad. It seems kind of pointless as a proprietary app on a Blackberry that no one else is going to own.</p>
<p>As for RIM&#8230; the sooner they skip the hardware and become a platform provider the better. License BBM plus package up their cross-platform management software.</p>
<p>Compared to how well RIM could do as a software company the hardware market is a mugs game. There is just no money in it (unless you happen to be Apple).</p>
<p>Samsung are doing ok at the moment picking over the scraps of what is left over but even they are going to get the screws put to them over the next 5 years by Huawei and ZTE.</p>
<p>This is really good. I hope the final product is really compelling, I might even consider buying in.</p>
<p>I agree but honestly I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d buy the phone but tablet will definitely be a good contender. Between windows 8 tablet and the next playbook. <br />
I own an iPad and android tablet and they&#8217;re toys compared to what rim and Microsoft have planned</p>
<p>The issue with BB10 for me is that all of the things that have leaked or shown that I like do not seem to be all that hard to implement in other OS&#8217;s via apps.</p>
<p>So this leaves me with little incentive to actually go there full on BB10 when it launches, since if any of these new features turn out to be amazing, there will surely be a few copycats for you to use on iOS/Android. I mean, since they are only releasing it at the end of the year, there might be camera apps with that &#8220;timetravel&#8221; feature on the appstore and Google Play store by the time BB10 comes out.</p>
<p>yep some of them will be rather be difficult like true multi-tasking, security etc</p>
<p>J.T. &#8230; prepare to eat your words. BB10 will prove you wrong yet again.</p>
<p>is it just me or is bb10 starting to look like a weird mash up of web-OS, iPhone, Android and WP7.</p>
<p>Well cannot agree more. But hey u will be paying one price for 4 different phone. Cheers!</p>
<p>is it just me or didn&#8217;t iPhone just fix their antenna and add a BBM like messaging service few months back&#8230;Think Different Nothing&#8230; iPhone hasn&#8217;t changed since it was born, anything that made it good was designed from a third party developer &#8230;which then they steel the idea and (ex) SIRI is born&#8230; that only works fully in America. ANYWAYSSSS&#8230;.BBOS is 13 years old&#8230; 13!!!! and its still sends msgs and email faster and more secure anddd efficient the an 5 year old iOS. But I will admit&#8230;BB did mess up thinking its technology would last forever but they&#8217;re coming back. So &#8220;Wake the eff Up&#8221; Hipsters.</p>
<p>The Samsung Instinct reincarnated for BB10.</p>
<p>It would be nice if they give the option to integrate text messaging and BBM like Apple does with iMessage. I also specified it as an &#8220;option&#8221; so people who want it separate don&#8217;t start whining.</p>
<p>that is already an existing option in BBM</p>
<p>My thoughts exactly</p>
<p>How about Apple, RIM and Google integrate all/most of the main messaging services like Palm did with Text, Gtalk, AIM, etc.</p>
<p>This could be a security issue for corporate users.</p>
<p>Microsoft is the closest to doing this but is missing Gtalk/AIM.  It has Windows Live and Facebook.</p>
<p>If they release a plugin based XMPP Gtalk for Windows Phone 8 messages app, I&#8217;m sold. There, I said it.</p>
<p>there are signs of this happening in PlayBook OS2.1 Beta code</p>
<p>In theory great, but Apple&#8217;s iMessage is tied into iCloud and Apple IDs and RIM&#8217;s BBM is tied into their &#8216;PIN&#8217; system. Interoperability means add complication and Apple for one won&#8217;t go there.</p>
<p>iMessage is still a bit flakey, messages appear on different devices in different chronological sequences, and the whole concept of sending an iMessage to a specific mobile number, or email address, or Apple ID, which you need to setup al your devices  properly to use, still needs to work. I gather this is coming in iOS6/Mountain Lion and whatever backend service upgrades they&#8217;ll roll out to iCloud.</p>
<p>Ideally I&#8217;d like text messages sent to my iPhone, bounced to my numberless iPad via iCloud and me able to respond. Get it done Apple!</p>
<p>Where is the read icon? Doubt they would remove that..</p>
<p>The Read icon is to the left of the text, it&#8217;s the little circle. A little tough to make out at this resolution but it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Very nice, didnt notice. :)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s there, to left of the message in the green circle.</p>
<p>Is it just me or does it look like the Kin?</p>
<p>L-Series. Guessing that&#8217;s the codename for the series of devices with no physical keyboard.</p>
<p>BB 10 looks a lot like Android. Not sure if that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
<p>It does look similar.</p>
<p>As all the mobile OSs share features they all start to look the same in some way or another.</p>
<p>But this does look uncannily like Android. A lot more so than iOS 6 or Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>The action bar, the shade on the text boxes, the ActionOverflow button, all seem to have been &#8220;inspired&#8221; from Android.</p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;s the stuff I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>Also I think most blatantly similar to Android is that shade of green! I mean I really don&#8217;t care how similar BB10 is to  Android. But brands have their trademark colors (if not necessarily <em>protected</em> by trademark), e.g., T-Mo magenta, UPS brown, Tiffany blue, John Deere green &amp; yellow etc. etc. and copying them can put your brand in a weird light.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping that RIM lets you use their devices without the need to get a SIM card that&#8217;s specifically provisioned to be used inside a BlackBerry. I&#8217;d love to try out BlackBerry 10 once it&#8217;s out, but they don&#8217;t sell BlackBerry handsets in my country (Finland).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s my understanding that the SIM doesn&#8217;t need to be specifically provisioned but the service provided to that SIM OTA by the carrier, I could definitely be wrong though. It&#8217;s been a while.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t sell BlackBerry handsets in Finland? Seriously, you&#8217;re lucky.</p>
<p>Does anyone else see a huge resemblance to the failed Microsoft Kin interface?</p>
<p>I like the OS.</p>

<p>More and more confirmation that you aren&rsquo;t just buying a phone/tablet. You are buying a platform.</p>
<p>Not one good app lol.</p>
<p>Wow, I am impressed that you looked at all 70,000 apps that fast. Please, do tell your secrets.</p>
<p>Well, those on front are not impressive at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Google Play music player is currently available in select territories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beats this any day of the week for me, in my jurisdiction. Same goes for tv, payment etc. You see, there&rsquo;s more to this than only apps, and there&rsquo;s more to this than the U.S&hellip;</p>
<p>Google Play music service is dead for me too, but that&rsquo;s not Google&rsquo;s fault. More to the point, I switched Blackberry World region to Japan, and it&rsquo;s &hellip; completely empty of content. Zero. Zilch. Nada.</p>
<p>At least Google play store has apps, and quite a decent selection of books and movies.</p>
<p>Selecting Japan yields the apps, games and themes at this moment &ndash; please check again.</p>
<p>In any case, there&rsquo;s no need for trial and error with the Blackberry World insofar as music/tv/movies are concerned because their <a href="http://press.rim.com/newsroom/press/2013/new-blackberry-world-for-blackberry-10-to-include-extensive-catalogue-of-songs-latest-movies-and-tv-shows.html">press release</a> made it quite clear what will be available where initially:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The video download and rental section in BlackBerry World will initially be available in the US, UK and Canada. Varying by region and distributor, customers will have access to movies from the following studios and independents: 20th Century Fox, Entertainment One (eOne), Lionsgate, MGM, National Film Board of Canada, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (US), Starz Digital Media, STUDIOCANAL, The Walt Disney Studios, Universal Pictures (UK), Warner Bros. Customers will also have access to TV shows from the following broadcasters and studios: ABC Studios, BBC Worldwide, CBC/Radio-Canada, CBS, DHX Media, ITV, National Geographic, NBCUniversal (UK), Nelvana, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (US), Starz Digital Media, Twentieth Century Fox Television, Univision Communications Inc, and Warner Bros.</p>

<p>Black Berry 10 Apps are not shown, yet. If you login and pick your device, you can&rsquo;t see the apps if you click on the link.<br /><img title="BB World" src="http://i.imgur.com/TDCWt2D.png?1" alt="BB World" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t wait until I get home and browse the new apps on my Playbook!&#8221; <del>-</del> Nobody,  2013</p>
<p>Just kidding. ;)</p>
<p>I love my Playbook. The UI is the best in the business. Even the browser is decent.</p>
<p>You are trolling yourself?</p>
<p><del>hopefully</del> not the case of &ldquo;same shit, different name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lol! There are already reviews written about some apps!<br />
Is this store exclusive to BB10? If not, then it makes sense</p>
<p>It is not exclusive to BlackBerry 10. In fact, you can only see the BB10 apps if you have a BB10 device and are logged in.</p>
<p>Ohh okay thanks for clearing that up! But why are other commentors bashing BB10 if those apps aren&rsquo;t for that OS?</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Also, a lot of these apps are available for the Dev Alpha A and B devices which hundreds of developers have.</p>
<p>BlackBerry by choice and all of that and what not and stuff&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>1280 &#215; 768 screen with 356 PPI</blockquote>
<p>O_O please be SLCD2</p>
<p>The thing says OLED&#8230;</p>
<p>oops. i missed that.  <strong>hides in corner</strong></p>
<p>The full touchscreen device is lcd. The keyboard one is OLED but the screenshot implies they may switch to lcd later on.</p>
<p>Calculating the diagonal screen size based on the aspect ratio of the resolution yields the following:</p>
<p>L-Series: 4.2&quot; diagonal.<br />
N-Series: 2.9&quot; diagonal.</p>
<p>What &#8220;One Screen Orientation means&#8221; if it is 720&#215;720?</p>
<p>I expect the device with the keyboard can only be used in portrait and not rotated to landscape. Isn&#8217;t that how current BB devices with a keyboard work?</p>
<p>How would widescreen apps be displayed on a square screen? <br />
Seems like it would be a pain in the ass for developers.</p>
<p>letterbox?</p>
<p>wtf is a widescreen app?</p>
<p>Angry Birds would be one. Or most side scroller games. Or Netflix. You get the picture.</p>
<p>How do they display on the (4:3) iPad?</p>
<p><img src="http://media.zenfs.com/en/blogs/technews/mw-630-angry-birds-ipad-630w.jpg" /></p>
<p>It would definitely by a pain for games developers, I just can&#8217;t see a square screen working well for a lot of popular games.</p>
<p>However the slide shows how normal apps are meant to cope with the change in aspect ratio. The square version simply shows fewer items (mail, messages, songs, whatever) on screen and devs are advised to use smaller text and shorter toolbars to try to squeeze more items on screen.</p>
<p>720&#215;720 has 330 PPI, that means it has approx 3.1&quot; diagonal screen, which most means it is not a square 1:1, following are my calculations for 3.1&quot; at different aspect ratios</p>
<p>Resoultion	PPI	Diagonal	Ratio	Height in Inches	Width in Inches<br />
720&#215;720	330	3.1	16:10	1.6	2.6<br />
720&#215;720	330	3.1	16:09	1.5	2.7<br />
720&#215;720	330	3.1	4:03	1.9	2.5</p>
<p>2013?! Can they move any slower?</p>
<p>they are basically asking to be a takeover target for Samsung right now</p>
<p>What would Samsung do with them?</p>
<p>Why, when they are so successful with Android?</p>
<p>Samsung could do plenty with Blackberry. For one they could turn it profitable again without completely destroying the brand name. Google&#8217;s going to do the same thing with Motorola, just as HP did with Compaq and Palm, just as MS is going to do with Nokia.</p>
<blockquote>just as HP did with Compaq and Palm</blockquote>
<p>Yeah.  Those acquisitions have really worked out well for all parties involved.</p>
<p>I personally feel Samsung is terrible at software, similar to HP.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re still testing the waters with BB10 first with &#8216;L-series&#8217;<br />
<strong>insert Titanic joke</strong></p>
<p>lol.</p>
<p>&#8220;as early as September&#8221;.  Funny.</p>
<p>cool</p>
<p>Another fail brought to you by Research In Motion.</p>
<p>Looks dead ugly. Blackberry I thought you were better than that.</p>
<p>The ambiguous shapes on a sketchy slide sure are ugly, like most ambiguous sketchy &#8216;leaked&#8217; slides.<br />
They&#8217;re shapes, not actual models</p>
<p>I&#8217;m totally psyched to see what the N-series will eventually become.</p>
<p>.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
55mm wide? It&#8217;s a joke?! A bit over half width of an iPhone?! C&#8217;mon.<br />
Either fake or RIM is getting nuts.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>An iPhone is 58mm wide&#8230;</p>
<p>The Verge author is wrong. The width quoted in the picture is the size of the screen not the device. Weird, I know.</p>
<p>n series? how is the naming any different from nokia&#8217;s n series again? not even the naming is original at bb &#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a code name. not an official name</p>
<p>They got it covered now. An iPhone and Sammy/HTC form factor.</p>
<p>Will these devices ever see the light of day&#8230;? Doubtful.</p>
<p>This kind of phone might bounce them back last year but, I just don&#8217;t see how they can make it with iPhone/Windows (Phone) 8/Galaxy Note 2 in Q3-Q4 2012.</p>
<p><img src="http://dailypicksandflicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/obama-walking-away-like-a-boss.gif" /></p>
<p>They forgot the F series. (I&#8217;ll let you figure it out.)</p>
<p>I take it you mean early 2013, not 2012.</p>
<p>beat me to it :P</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackforest&#8221; looks like a 9+ inch tablet.</p>
<p>Do we want to place bets on how many of these devices we&#8217;ll actually see before something horrible happens to RIM?</p>
<p>Just the first 2. It should be enough to see if BB10 was successful or not.</p>
<p>The first one should be enough.<br />
QNX is a great OS but afaik the amount of work to turn it into a good phone OS is absolutely colossal.<br />
Third party devs will also need good tools, APIs and more generally a framework adapted to the creation of phone apps.<br />
If you look at what RIM is proposing in that regard for the development of BBos apps, you will read a lot of nightmare stories coming from developers trying to work on that platform.</p>
<p>If the first QNX phone does not have an UX comparable to Android &amp; iOS and tools that are not completely ridiculous, I think RIM will be toast.</p>
<p>The main issue is that Google have shown by their well timed Project Butter (a faster smoother Android) that they see the errors of their ways and will fix things in due course. So, any security issues in Android/Chrome will be dealt with, making the QNX path less attractive, despite it&#8217;s robust nature.</p>
<p>I agree when the playbook first came out, it was a bit of a struggle, but the platform was new and the development team did really interact to help with problems we had.</p>
<p>I went to bb10 jam in london (just to get the phone) and they really have got their act together, I mean anyone could develop for android or make a html 5 app and then just port it to bb10. You would be stupid not to. There are soooo many options for developing for bb10 that you kinda have little reason not to port and make extra money.</p>
<p>I still think RIM has a slim chance, they just really can&#8217;t blow it, like they keep doing.</p>
<p>I hope that RIM will survive, an healthy competition is essential for consumers.<br />
As for the porting of an existing app, it really depends :<br />
unless you just want to work on another platform by curiosity, you have to ponder if the time you will spend doing this port will be as cost effective as spending it on your main platform.<br />
 There is always a chance that RIM will ship an extremely good product that manages to create some hype; it just seems unlikely given their track record but unlikely does not mean impossible.</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>If they really release yet another Playbook that should finish them off.</p>
<p>Agreed.  If they are stupid enough to release a new playbook in the 4th quarter against the likes of iPad and iPad mini(possible but not confirmed), Nexus 7(and all the other less than $300 ICS/Jellybean tablets), and SurfaceRT(and all the other WindowsRT tablets) RIM will be in a world of hurt and disappointment.  Yeah, that would be the final nail.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like that old line about insanity &#8211; except in this instance the thing that they&#8217;re doing again and again is itself insane.</p>
<p>They are really deluded if they think that they will be able to launch a successful Playbook follow up</p>
<p>.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
RIM, seriously? 2013? <br />
Why none gives a f.ck!<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>Too late &#8230; chances are Q1&#8217;13 announcement with Q2&#8217;13 availability unless we see yet another delay. Where as in Q3&#8217;12 we will see JB rolling out en masse, WP8 and iOS6 released. By the time BB10 is announced/released everyone else wouldn&#8217;t have moved on to working/announcing the next version of their respective OS. If MS transition from WM to WP is anything to go by it will take RIM just as long to gain any traction with BB10 and I don&#8217;t think RIM can afford to wait for 1-2 years.</p>
<p>By the time BB OS 10 comes out well be on wp9 ioS 7 and android key lime pue</p>
<p>Oh, Android will probably be on Zabaglione</p>
<p>Speak English</p>
<p>Why? Italian is so much sexier :)</p>

<p>&#8220;Here be dragons!&#8221;</p>
<p>May as well be a road map for Atlantis.</p>
<p>Rim #1 &#8211; Better look like we&#8217;ve been doing something for the past 6 months before we get fired.<br />
Rim #2- Uh, um, uh, here  give them this.</p>
<p><img src="http://dondueck.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/halfinthebag.jpg" /></p>
<p> I cannot even look at this picture without hearing Plinkett&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>god nabbit</p>
<p>what was that black goo?</p>
<p>I would have kept my ****ing helmet on, just in case.</p>
<p>so was he just some sort of secret a** hole?</p>
<p>My dad is going to be so excited to hear this!</p>
<p>Holy Unicorn Batman!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d laugh if RIM became the next Apple after all this</p>
<p>That would imply they have some combination of leadership and technology that no one else has that can put them back on top.  They simply don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it would be funny no?</p>
<p>At least BB10 doesn&#8217;t have a lot of pointless skeuomorphic design elements, right? Right?</p>
<p>It will be retro by the time it comes out</p>
<p>bb10 is hawtt</p>
<p>I just went back to iOS and definitely feels antiquated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long road<br />
Getting from there to here<br />
It&#8217;s been a long time<br />
But my time is finally near</p>
<p>Soft rock Star Trek themes.</p>
<p>BB 10 looks nice but 2013 is toooooo late</p>
<p>Playbook is getting a lot of good games, but the pricing is ridiculous&#8230; If RIM can do something about the pricing, I might actually buy some of these games&#8230;</p>
<p>The games cost a dollar or two more, but don&#8217;t forget that the Playbook itself is only two hundred dollars. You can buy a lot of games for that difference in pricing&#8230;</p>
<p>lol, not for people like me who bought the playbook on the release date!!&#8230;</p>
<p>Just curious, does windows phone have these? The battle for number 3 is on!!</p>
<p>Windows Phone has a couple of those titles, but not all.</p>
<p>Nah, the battle for #3 is already over. Microsoft has almost endless amounts of money to dump into making sure Windows Phone is successful, RIM does not.</p>
<p>And the reason for the &#8220;lack&#8221; of games on the Windows Phone platform is the inability to write unmanaged code (C++ &amp; DirectX) which several middleware libraries like Unreal Engine and Unity 3D rely on to work. That will be fixed in Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>Tools, not toys.</p>
<p>Good one!</p>
<p>This is great for the PlayBook. So many games though. We need some more quality apps that are not games.</p>
<p>I just want a 10&quot; version&#8230; 7&quot; is too small.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d hate to see RIM go.</p>
<p>They should wake up.</p>
<p>what will RIM ever bring to the market?  I have an iMac, an iPad, an iPhone 4, a Galaxy Nexus, looking at all the tech products out there, I dont see anywhere that RIM could influence things for the better.  Why would I want a RIM device, what could it possibly do?</p>
<p>Android and iOS, its set in stone now, like Windows vs Mac.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t you want a RIM device? You can emulate Android apps on the Playbook, (in the near future) use BBM on the Playbook, use BBM on the BB phones, play exclusive games and use exclusive apps&#8230;and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>It seems  Blackberry evangelism falls under <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Poe's_Law">Poe&#8217;s law</a>.</p>
<p>You know that kid people used to make fun of in school?</p>
<p>Yeah&#8230;</p>
<p>Very good, all I need is a playbook and I&#8217;m set&#8230; I really want a BB10 phone with a playbook&#8230;.whew that would be a killer combination&#8230;</p>
<p>So Halfbrick will bringJetpack Joyride to BBOS first instead of Android?</p>
<p>Yeah make no sense to me either, with its less the one percent market share. No one is clamoring for BBOS of any kind outside some tweens.</p>
<p>Motorola just announced their Q1 result <del>-</del> 100000 tablets.  In total, that&#8217;s 1.1 million tablets for Motorola were shipped.</p>
<p>RIM shipped 1.3 million Playbooks and has sold 1.1 million of them.</p>
<p>And supposedly Motorola has 7% of the Android market share.</p>
<p>RIM&#8217;s paid them. If they haven&#8217;t ported it to Android then RIM is definitely paying for the apps.</p>
<p>Not necessarily, Square Enix just released Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light for the Playbook <del>-</del> which Android doesn&#8217;t even have.  And Sony announced back in Sept of last year that the Xperia Play would have Lara Croft in November last year <del>-</del> but still haven&#8217;t released it yet.</p>
<p>It just shows that porting big 3D games to QNX is much easier than porting it to Android.</p>
<p>Keep bringing the games to PlayBook, RIM!  I&#8217;d much rather pay for and play games on it compared to my iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Did they hint that anyone would want it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure Palm said the same thing.</p>
<p>If only Palm would&#8217;ve licensed it from the beginning. But they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll never kn</p>
<p>God damn it. Verge&#8217;s non editing posts plus disappearing iOS keyboard. Was gonna say: We&#8217;ll never know, but it likely wouldn&#8217;t have mattered. Palm basically had no money to push the os.</p>
<p>Who would want to license that, that didnt want to do the same for Webos?</p>
<p>He also said he wanted to turn blackberry again as an &#8220;aspirational object of high desire&#8221;</p>
<p>Crack pipe dreams&#8230; Nothing says aspirational like a $2000 BB in 2012.</p>
<p>It seems like this guy is only slightly less crazy than his preprocessors. I mean really, who would want to pay for this?</p>
<p>#define NO_ONE_IS_LESS_CRAZY_THEN_PREPROCESSOR (0)</p>
<p>Someone deep in his C coding.</p>
<p>*predecessors<br />
Ugh, I only just noticed.</p>
<p>Actually, I think you might have been right the first time,  seems like everything he says seems to have passed through Lazarides first.</p>
<p>Morons.  NOW they decide to license it? When no one wants it? How about 6 y ears ago, huh RIMM?</p>
<p>who would pay for that?</p>
<p>In Venezuela and Indonesia they are still leading growing and leading  other brands</p>
<p>Yeah, but the margins there are razor thin, made on their basic devices.</p>
<p>RIM has completely lost the high margin/high profit market in Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going dooooooooooown&#8230;&#8230;..<br />
Seriously I&#8217;ve been predicting RIM going under for the last 3 months &#8211; it&#8217;s gonna happen folks.</p>
<p>3 months? Im pretty sure everyone has known for years</p>
<p>True, I just meant predicting to mysel really. :)</p>
<p>I actually wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if somebody like Nokia, already strong in emerging market economies, builds the hardware for future Blackberry devices.</p>
<p>That is, if they survive the whole Windows Phone venture if it tanks&#8230;..</p>
<p>Nobody cares about BB 10. Lisense BBM however and we have a different story.</p>
<p>Remember that Blackberry&#8217;s market share  is still bigger than Windows Phone.</p>
<p>Blackberry 10 has 0% marketshare so Windows Phone technically has a larger marketshare than that.</p>
<p>WP7: going up. BB: going down. Who cares if you&#8217;re biggest if you&#8217;re falling quickly?</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s true, but only if you define RIM&#8217;s share as being the share for all it&#8217;s mobile OSes and Microsoft&#8217;s being its share only for WP7.</p>
<p>If you look at both from the perspective of corporate share then they&#8217;re both falling.<br />
If you consider it only at an OS level then no doubt BB-10 will have rising share after it launches (since the only way from 0 is up)</p>
<p>They&#8217;re actually in a similarly bad state in mobile, but MS can put up with that fact a lot longer.</p>
<p>I still think that BB is not dying anytime soon, and even their current crop is more than a good enough solid communication tool. So the Verge and all you infidels out there can keep on preaching BB&#8217;s doom.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, &#8220;good enough&#8221; products aren&#8217;t really good enough to compete these days.</p>
<p>The irony is that hardware isn&#8217;t really the problem with RIM.</p>
<p>Step 1: Release BBM for Android, iOS, &amp; Windows Phone<br />
Step 2: Sell Hardware biz<br />
Step 3: ???<br />
Step 4: Fade into Bolivian.</p>
<p>I LOL&#8217;ED especially at Bolivian, Oblivion* :D</p>
<p>This is insane. Hardware&#8217;s the only thing differentiating them from other companies, except maybe their terrible software. Besides BBM and email, BlackBerry hardware is the only thing users really like about their devices.</p>
<p>Agreed. Who would want to license an unproven fourth OS that will have a clearly inferior ecosystem for the foreseeable future? BlackBerry hardware is their advantage.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to see RIM software on others devices. I want to see others software (like WebOS) on RIM devices.</p>
<p>This is all I could think of when I saw the image.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BeFNa.jpg" /></p>
<p>Honestly, I think it&#8217;ll hurt them more than it&#8217;ll help.</p>
<p>Their software is terrible. QNX is nice and all performance wise, but their interface is just so ugly. They have a chance to entirely revamp their interface withBB10 and I hope they take the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>IMO, with BB10 they should boil down to only one device (that works on multiple carriers), and update it yearly, instead of flooding their own market, and not updating their devices.</p>
<p>Because everyone wants to beta test a dying companies new services</p>
<p>Company&#8217;s</p>
<p>Ha LOL</p>
<p>First, learn to spell if you want people to take you seriously. Just like Elliot said, it&#8217;s &#8220;company&#8217;s.&#8221; Second, they&#8217;re not dying. They in fact grew their user base in the last quarter to over 80 million (that&#8217;s people who are paying monthly BIS/BES fees) and they also grew their BBM user base to 60 million. Furthermore, they grew their cash reserves. So in conclusion, BBM is great and your comment is very foolish.</p>
<p>I hope they can stay in the game, the more competition among the device makers the better.</p>
<p>Agreed</p>
<p>Am i the only one who doesn&#8217;t think RIM is going to die anytime soon?</p>
<p>That depends.  Do you still use a Blackberry?</p>
<p>No i use a WindowsPhone but i will be moving back when the BB10 phones come out.</p>
<p>No you&#8217;re not. RIM isnt going anywhere. People still fail to realize that there is a HUGE group of users who think apps are dumb, and use their phone for talking and work only. I dont use a BB but I couldnt care less about 98% of all apps for Android/iOS and I dont play games on my phone. RIM will be fine.</p>
<blockquote>I couldnt care less about 98% of all apps for Android/iOS and I dont play games on my phone. RIM will be fine.</blockquote>
<p>yep..too many people thinks that the world revolve around Apple..they haven&#8217;t left the US because no one abroad could care less about it.lol</p>
<p>Sorry, what? Nobody outside of the US could care less about Apple? Are you serious? Apple is one of the very few companies who has rolled out their entire ecosystem worldwide &#8211; devices, movies and music included. Apple is as popular outside of the US as it is within it.</p>
<blockquote>Apple is one of the very few companies who has rolled out their entire ecosystem worldwide – devices, movies and music included.</blockquote>
<p>Not true. India is the world&#8217;s second largest mobile market and we still can&#8217;t buy any movies or music from iTunes.</p>
<p>This is a half truth, RIM itself has been pushing hard to get developers to develop for  both Playbook and BB.  RIM hammers home the point that developers for RIM make consistently more profit on the RIM platform than any other platform.  It&#8217;s a steady pay cheque if you are risk adverse, but if you want to strike it rich you roll the dice with iOS.</p>
<p>The world is changing to a &#8220;bring your own device to work&#8221; setup, the smart phones that have no support for them will quickly fall behind.  Hence the rise of both iOS and Android these past few years.  This trend will continue and it has already started to  bleed from personal mobile devices to laptops and computing devices.</p>
<p>Today, only a handful of corporations have mobile development teams that develop apps for their own uses. To  reach that level of commitment requires  confidence and support from the developer community; having strong roots at the consumer level is an absolute must.</p>
<p>RIM is not naive.  If they cannot stop the losses at the consumer level, they will be pushed out of the enterprise space and they know this.</p>
<p>TLDR; RIM IS going somewhere, whether up or down, it is definitely not going to be still these next 3 years.</p>
<p>No, you&#8217;re definitely not the only one.</p>
<p>You need competition sure, but I don&#8217;t know that more = better. Better for who? Especially if no one is buying into these other platforms. And developers sure aren&#8217;t gonna waste their time on them. So who is it for?</p>
<p>We see how much MS is struggling for just a piece of the pie. And that&#8217;s Microsoft. They&#8217;ve to gobs of cash &amp; are still having trouble. Is anyone really under the impression that RIM is gonna somehow do any better?</p>
<p>So I think unless you&#8217;re Apple or Google, and the 3rd party guys who make their devices, then you&#8217;ve got a hell of an uphill fight. MS may pull it off since they&#8217;ve got the money to stay in it. RIM? Not so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;And developers sure aren’t gonna waste their time on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prejudice, prejudice, prejudice.</p>
<p>BlackBerry App World generates more total revenue on apps than Google Play. 13% of App World devs already made over $ 100,000 each. True story.</p>

<p>But hey, let me guess:</p>
<p>1. Source is RIM itself and they&#8217;re simply lying<br />
2. The article is 9 months old and therefore things have changed massively</p>
<p>What do you say?</p>
<p>You sir are correct. It&#8217;s a well known fact that Android apps don&#8217;t generate money. Only a fool would argue that.</p>
<p>Well, they obviously aren&#8217;t giving up without a figh :)</p>
<p>*fight</p>
<p>This will be really cool&#8230;once RIM gives up on BB10 and BBM inevitably goes multi-platform.</p>
<p>#justkidding<br />
#kindof</p>
<p>#shutup</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the adoption rates in developing countries where RIM is still selling strong, but for pretty much all of N America and Europe, this is meaningless. It&#8217;d be nice if it were cross platform, with the richest experience being on a blackberry&#8230;but to try to make a facetime type platform, on a platform that isn&#8217;t doing too well&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t make much sense.</p>
<p>I think India is going the way of Android and as for SEA countries especially Indonesia, the growth has been shrinking and Android has took over as the platform which has the most market share (52%).</p>
<p>Indonesia and India are RIM&#8217;s biggest markets in the emerging market category and low-cost Samsung Androids are eating away at RIM&#8217;s market share there.</p>
<p>This could be such a killer feature, if they release a low cost phone to go with it. Something with the same price of the 9300, but up to date specs. Could be really popular with teenagers (though I could be overestimating worldwide demand, coming from Canada)</p>
<p>I dunno&#8230;. aren&#8217;t most teenagers just texting these days?</p>
<p>A lot of carriers are offering unlimited voice minutes simply because that&#8217;s not the most important task on a phone anymore (ironic, huh)</p>
<p>And most prepaid plans are offering unlimited everything too.</p>
<p>So&#8230; I&#8217;m not seeing how the promise of free voice calls over WIFI is an amazing thing&#8230; especially for teenagers.</p>
<p>Chances are&#8230; teenagers already have more voice minutes than they know what to do with. :)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these wonders are mythical to us Canadians. The only unlimited plans we get here are from our shitty carriers, that have only recently started operating on the AWS frequency (or is it spectrum?). If you want real reception everywhere, you need to pay out of the a** for a few hundred minutes from the Big Three carriers or one of their subsidiaries. There are exceptions, but they&#8217;re generally only for people signing new three year contracts, which I refuse to do.</p>
<p>Valid point about the texting, I&#8217;ll concede the point.</p>
<p>True&#8230; not everyone has unlimited minutes.</p>
<p>But I guess I&#8217;m not seeing voice minutes as being important like they once were.  Some carriers are now including minutes because they aren&#8217;t really valuable anymore. That says something.</p>
<p>I still have a minutes plan&#8230; 450 minutes a month on Verizon in the US&#8230; but on a normal month I <em>might</em> use 100.</p>
<p>Almost all of my calls are mobile-to-mobile&#8230; so those are free anyway.</p>
<p>My point was&#8230; I don&#8217;t think people are running out of minutes&#8230; even if they are only allowed a certain amount per month.</p>
<p>And I especially don&#8217;t think teenagers talk on the phone much anymore :)</p>
<p>So in response to this article&#8230; I don&#8217;t think teenagers will be excited about free voice calls.  They already have enough minutes that they aren&#8217;t using.</p>
<p>Whoa. That&#8217;s pretty slick.</p>
<p>Useful?<br />
Yes, on my company issued BB on business trips.</p>
<p>Would I actually pay money to buy a BB for personal use because of this?<br />
No, I have Skype, thank you.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t Skype cost money? Or maybe that is just to non-Skype people.</p>
<p>Skype to Skye is free.  Skype to a phone number costs, though less than phone to phone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my feeling too.  It&#8217;s another non-standard VOIP system.<br />
Sign some licencing deal with Microsoft, and modify it to be Skype compatible.  Then it&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p>Gotta open up play nice with the rest of the world, instead of going inwards.</p>
<p>BB10, this is for those that wont be on BB10.</p>
<p>Video Chat will also be enabled on BBM on BB10</p>
<p>Why would they need Skype when there are already 60 million active BBM users who are ALWAYS on? If Skype wants to develop an app that integrates with BBM, they can go ahead and do just like others have. RIM has its own user base to cater to, they don&#8217;t need to be catering to Skype.</p>
<p>Great. This could be very useful. Too bad there are a lot of cross platform apps that do this&#8230;</p>
<p>Make BBM cross platform ffs, I would gladly pay a monthly price to use it.</p>
<p>I hope they add this feature to the PlayBook as well!  I&#8217;m so excited RIM is finally innovating and Apple is going dull.</p>
<p>Technically the Playbook doesn&#8217;t have BBM unless you use Blackberry Bridge.</p>
<p>Haha, good one. RIM is finally innovating by bringing WIFI only voice calling to their phones. Hey, not even video calling, just voice calling.</p>
<p>What an innovation, we didn&#8217;t have similar services for other platforms before and Apple never did anything called FaceTime&#8230; ;-)</p>
<p>On BB10, my guess is this will include video. The playbook already includes video calling using BlackBerry ID (not via BBM though).</p>
<p>PlayBook will be getting BBM with BB10 which will include voice and video chat.</p>
<p>The carriers need to be turned into dumb pipes. The nexus 4 at a cheap off contract price is a great start, but we should be able to use any device we want, use our data how we want, with no one blocking VoIP, which wallet app we can and can&#8217;t download, and certainty no one telling us when and where we can face time. Once this happens, true innovation can rise.</p>
<p><img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img404/4194/rimfaith.png" /></p>
<p>Can anyone explain how BBM is so great and/or special? What I can gather from it is that it used to be a thing back in the day, but now with Android and iOS phones dominating, and a plethora of cross-platform free apps for which you just need the phone numbers and <em>not</em> a login or PIN of your contact (Viber, Tango, Line, Voxer, etc.), and other, lesser, cross-platform apps for which you do need to log in (Skype, Gtalk, etc.), and even worse, non-cross-platform apps for which you do not need a PIN (iMessage/Facetime), it seems that BBM is worse than all of the above.</p>
<p>And by the way, all those mentioned apps work on mobile internet too, not only WiFi.</p>
<p>Blablabla.</p>
<p>BBM is easy, looks nice, is ultra fast, has plenty more features, is highly system-integrated and it&#8217;s far more stable and reliable. Just in the case BBM would go cross-platform, nobody would be using WhatsApp anymore, even though it&#8217;s the best rip-off of BBM out there. Thats for sure.</p>
<p>None of those assertions are backed up with anything resembling evidence. Talk about &#8220;blablabla&#8221;.</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;m asking for a real reason. I understand how it was big before, but now?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s actually right. I&#8217;ve used whatsapp, Kik and the like but nothing compares to the speed and reliability of BBM. If that continues and Blackberry do have an advantage. Plus if BBM was to go multi platform, a lot of people would jump ship to BBM, including me, due to the great experience. Whatsapp does not compare to BBM. It&#8217;s not as reliable, not as fast and just doesn&#8217;t deliver like BBM does.</p>
<p>You still think that being a fraction fast justifies for the high price of the service when there are plenty free alternatives out there? I use whatsapp and a major advantage is the cross platform availability&#8230; Even the Windows phone has it and I feel it has a pretty good UI and is plenty fast for free messaging.</p>
<p>Even Apple&#8217;s own imessage is really great for me (all my friends have an iPhone) and even that is free. So I dunno why people keep persisting about a service that should be free and cross platform in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I dunno why people keep persisting about a service that should be free and cross platform in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s what&#8217;s under the hood that you can&#8217;t see. BBM runs over the RIM infrastructure. It SEEMs to be the same but it isn&#8217;t. It takes less data, less battery, is more secure against hacking and it&#8217;s faster and more reliable. And it costs RIM money as they have to maintain it and they got strong revenues from carriers. That&#8217;s it. BBM like it is today IS NOT ABLE to run cross platform, for technical reasons. That&#8217;s why the WiFi PlayBook still doesn&#8217;t have native BBM and that is why even on BB10 phones there will still be a BlackBerry dataplan required for using BBM (only). If you use iMessage or WhatsApp on a daily basis, sure does that work fine for you (I use WhatsApp myself as I have many cross platform friends). But if you&#8217;re used to using BBM, you don&#8217;t want to miss it. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it, but BBM, especially on QWERTY-BlackBerrys, is like having a talk face-to-face.</p>
<p>Again, no evidence just &#8220;feeling&#8221;. And BBM can and has gone down. If any of the services, including the multiplatform ones go down, which there is no reason to think is not just as likely, you can always go with another one, still with the likelihood that more friends will be using it than BBM.</p>
<p>Oh, and it isn&#8217;t free? I didn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p>Okay there seems to be no way to convince you. I understand where your coming from and I respect that but unless you give BBM a fair try you&#8217;ll never realized where we are coming from. It is a superior service that you really have to use to know exactly why that is.</p>
<p>Hey, I&#8217;m not the one making any assertions, but I expect the answers to the questions I posed be backed up with more than feelings, however strong they are. Links? Actual tests? Anything? Features are debatable, and to many who criticize this, if you notice, multi-platform is a big one that trumps most other ones.</p>
<p>No its about assertions but one really has to use BBM to see why it&#8217;s superior. Tests really can&#8217;t tell you everything. I can see where your coming from though and your right, I should be able to give you proof.</p>
<p>Unfortunately at this time all I can say is, use it to see why. I don&#8217;t have proof but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some around the internet.</p>
<p>Hmm, interesting. Actually I&#8217;d say Facetime and iMessage together does more than the above (since video calling is supported) and is also integrated into the OS, contacts, etc.</p>
<p>iMessage? Isn&#8217;t that this BBM rip-off from Apple? I can&#8217;t say how many times I heard iPhone-using friends of mine arguing &#8220;hey, didn&#8217;t you get my iMessage&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;hell, no!&#8221;. Observing the phones side by side then shows that the message(s) didn&#8217;t come through or was(were) delayed. And the best thing is that this happens automatically, texts are transformed into iMessages. So if you want to make sure somebody gets your message, you even don&#8217;t have that choice. Can you send and receive data with iMessage that is neither a photo nor a video? Can you install multiple groups with group pictures, multiple threaded chats per group and group-wise photosharing including comment-functions? Tap and hold on a picture in your gallery, does appear an option that says &#8220;share with iMessage group&#8221;?</p>
<p>With BB10 RIM will even go a step further. live-screen-, data- and file-sharing during BBM video chats. iMessage&#8230;.lol.</p>
<p>I hope RIM pays you well in the marketing dept.</p>
<p>Actually, do they pay you at all?</p>
<p>Sarcasm aside, you sure convinced me that the &#8220;share with BBM group&#8221; feature is the thing that will save RIM.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to say BBM and its features/differences will save RIM, I was just going to say that it still has its advantages and isn&#8217;t completely obsolete. But people can&#8217;t deal with it. Everything has to be black or white, everything RIM does is plain &#8216;useless&#8217; and &#8216;too late&#8217;. And if that isn&#8217;t the case, there still has to be mentioned that whatever they do &#8217;won&#8217;t save them&#8217;.</p>
<p>People priorize watching movies on the go and a bunch of useless fun-apps over communicating and persistently ignore the fact that BlackBerry is still superior in communicating and getting stuff done.</p>
<p>Just eat this.<br />

<p>Nope, you just meant to bark around a bit, even though noone in this thread actually called it garbage. I for one was merely pointing out that there are other, just as integrated solutions out there.</p>
<p>Tango and Google Talk do that as well and are multiplatform. Tango also integrates with your contacts, just like Whatsapp and Viber (there&#8217;s a reason I didn&#8217;t mention Whatsapp though, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s up there with the others, with just text). But yeah, Facetime generally works with higher quality and less lag, and Tango is a bit spammy.</p>
<p>RELIABILITY. BBM is super reliable, unlike Whatsapp. Plus, I can send a whole variety of files with BBM. In addition, BBM allows for BBM-integrated apps. On BlackBerry, you can download a game, play against one of your friends, and have integrated BBM chat to chat with the friend you&#8217;re playing with.</p>
<p>Free Wifi calling between BBM users &#8211; So like FaceTime without video? Am I missing something here? I don&#8217;t see how this is terribly useful or necessary considering that most smartphone plans include unlimited voice anyways.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simple. BB10 will have voice/video chat. Current BB devices don&#8217;t have a front facing camera so they won&#8217;t have video. This voice feature will allow current devices to have voice chat with new BB10 devices. Simple as that.</p>
<p>The other thing is that BBM is a very popular app. Over 60 million active users who are ALWAYS on, always connected. Adding voice will greatly improve the functionality because it now allows you to also voice chat with friends who are overseas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just an additional feature to an already great chat app.</p>
<p>I see what you are saying but I&#8217;m not sure why tech sites like The Verge and Wired are giving it huge spread articles as if this is a giant leap in RIM&#8217;s &#8220;comeback&#8221;. It&#8217;s a catchup feature to an app on a declining user base unless BB10 is a drastic step ahead of Android or iOS (and let&#8217;s be honest, it certainly doesn&#8217;t look that way).</p>
<p>This is truly amazing and innovative&#8230;.Rip Van Winkle</p>
<p>I bet the carrier&#8217;s will be jumping over themselves to support this phone with free wifi calls&#8230;</p>
<p>This is something every company should do. Screw the carriers. I&#8217;ve been expecting for Google to do this with Google Voice since 2010, though Wi-Fi and 3G VOIP. And don&#8217;t just integrate the button in a deep setting or submeny somewhere in the OS. Make it highly visible in the call screen menu, just like the Call button is right now.</p>
<p>Keeping their cards close to their vest?</p>

<p>RIM is expanding functionality of BBM and people are throwing dirt at them. What&#8217;s wrong here?</p>
<p>&#8216;Close to the vest&#8217;.??? Not everybody wears a vest&#8230; Some people wear only vests&#8230; But everybody has a chest!</p>
<p>Too little, too late.  Even people who a year or two ago were avid BBM users have moved on and the fact that you can only use this with other BBM users means that it&#8217;s essentially worthless.  Unless they&#8217;re going to release a BBM app for every OS this feature is beyond useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too little, too late&#8221; blablablablabla.</p>
<p>BBM was great when a lot of my friends had Blackberries. It used to be a common sight for most smartphones in the room to be Blackberries&#8230; as seen in the photo below.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; not so much. People have moved on.</p>
<p>Sure&#8230; if RIM released a BBM client for other platforms&#8230; it <em>might</em> have some adoption.  But I think it would be weird using &#8220;Blackberry Messenger&#8221; on an iPhone :)</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/VQ5Bl.jpg" /></p>
<p>Poor RIM&#8230; people used to love your phones.  Normal people&#8230; not just businessmen. Now it&#8217;s a different story.</p>
<p>Well, all my friends now use BB alongside an Android or iPhone. They can&#8217;t let go of the BB just because of BBM but once it totally broke down, they leave the platform without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>My friends and I dropped our BBs and BBM without even a second thought.</p>
<p>What makes BBM so sticky in your group that they are willing to carry <strong><em>2</em></strong> phones?</p>
<p>With those gradients, it wouldn&#8217;t be out of place on a HTC.</p>
<p>Right at the point that all the US carriers are forcing people into &#8220;share everything&#8221; plans with unlimited minutes.   So they are working on a feature that only people who are desperately holding ok to their old plan care to use (I&#8217;m thinking US here, don&#8217;t know about the rest of the world.)</p>
<p>I remember when i had a stupid blackberry some years ago in order to use beta software you had to remember these long key codes , or something crazy. I forget why even</p>
<p>Cool story bro.</p>
<p>BBM is a great messaging service which just got better. This feature makes for easy and integrated calls between BBM users wherever they are in the world while leveraging low cost or free wifi.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it puzzles me how you actually manage to edit documents on the go on a screen of a fingernail&#8217;s size, since the other half of the device is occupied by your colossal, non-adaptive physical keyboard.</p>
<p>I honestly question your productivity.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Call me on BBM and we can discuss it.</p>
<p>But so does Viber, and that#s cross-platform.</p>
<p>But is it as tightly integrated and is it a power/data conscious app? In any case choice is good but BB users can have exclusive stuff too&#8230;</p>
<p>The wi-fi only part kind of sucks. I use gtalk on my phone to call people in other countries almost every day.  It works over all kinds of connections.</p>
<p>an awesome addition on the phone for people who actually do work on their phones. And not pretend to do work  while playing Angry Birds on your iPhone .</p>
<p>blackberry = tool,  iPhone = toy , Android = tinkerers</p>
<p>Funny how much productive software there is for iPads, how much custom made inhouse software there is and how much super specialised software there is for fields such as radiology or geology.</p>
<p>Sure though, the iPad is a toy and we can all go out and see all those Playbooks being used in super productive environments everywhere around us. ;-)</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it weird that the WIFI notification icon is not ON, on any of the pictures? // Attention to details RIM&#8230;</p>
<p>BTW This requires to reset your phone like 3 times&#8230; so is a loooong wait.</p>
<p>A lot of noise about nothing&#8230;business users don&#8217;t really need this and since it&#8217;s limited to WiFi it&#8217;s almost useless to the average consumer unless you&#8217;re just really tight on minutes and can afford to stay in the range of your Wireless network. Um&#8230;google voice. That is all.</p>
<p>Everyone should consider these facts while reading this article:<br />
1) Most plans for smartphones include unlimited voice already<br />
2) Both ends have to be BBM users on Wifi (a declining population considering RIM&#8217;s decline)<br />
3) Third party apps like Skype and Vibring have already offered this for quite some time on the popular platforms.<br />
5) Apple provided this service paired with video since FaceTime launched with the iPhone 4 more than 2 years ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m failing to see why this is so exciting. Is it simply because RIM has done something other than sitting on the sideline? This service is already 4 or 5 years late&#8230;</p>
<p>Valid points in a small sense, but you must consider the following:</p>
<p>1) The point is not paying for voice period, not how much voice you can use. You missed it.</p>
<p>2) People are connected to Wifi more often than you think on their smartphones, between work and home, anyone who doesnt use Wifi for data whenever possible will learn their lesson quickly, as Im sure you know.</p>
<p>3) This is true, but neither of these are as efficient of a communications/messaging platform as a BASE that BBM is. Dont get me wrong, theyre nice to have, but EVERY BlackBerry has BBM for free.</p>
<p>4) You missed a number</p>
<p>5)Nobody uses Facetime. Everyone who has a BlackBerry uses BBM over anything else when communicating with other BlackBerry users for messaging. There is probably a reason for that.</p>
<p>Pretty sure RIM had been up to a lot. Sure, they definitely made mistakes in the past, but they&#8217;ve been doing everything that they&#8217;re supposed to lately, in my opinion. You should really look into what BlackBerry 10 can do. Watch some vidja&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Ammendment: 2) Subscribers grew from active 78 million to 80+ million active last quarter according to Google.</p>
<p>While you raise some good points, I&#8217;ll clear up what I was trying to point out:<br />
1) You missed this point that I raised entirely. I was not commenting on amounts of voice. What I was saying is that if you have a BlackBerry (or any smartphone for that matter) you are most likely paying for unlimited voice whether you like it or not, as these are really the only plans that most carriers provide for these phones. My comment was not about <em>amount</em> of voice, it was about the fact that you are already paying for unlimited voice no matter what.</p>
<p>2) You have a good point, but BBM still pales in comparison to far more ubiquitous platforms like Skype (available on all major platforms) with 600M users. I do not see where you got 80M BBM users though, RIM themselves only report 60: <a href="https://developer.blackberry.com/develop/bbm_connected/bbm.html" target="_blank">https://developer.blackberry.com/develop/bbm_connected/bbm.html</a></p>
<p>3) In your opinion, how is Skype not as &#8220;efficient as a base&#8221; with 600M users, but BBM -with a fraction of that &#8211; somehow is? That&#8217;s a pretty large base if you ask me. Not sure if I understand what you meant by that though, I may have interpreted your thinking wrong.</p>
<p>4) Yes, I did indeed miss a number.</p>
<p>5) I think that&#8217;s pretty brash to assume that <em>nobody</em> uses FaceTime. You are also assuming that everyone who uses BBM&#8217;s messaging feature will also use BBM calling just as much. That&#8217;s akin to saying everyone who uses iMessages on the iPhone also uses FaceTime equally. I&#8217;m sure you certainly don&#8217;t agree with that. I know I certainly wouldn&#8217;t make that assumption.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, RIM has done a lot &#8211; a lot of catch-up. I have seen what BB10 has to offer and to me, it does not seem like BB10 offers anything way ahead of the competition. This was my thinking and why I made the comment I did in the first place. Yes, BBM voice calling is nice feature for people who use BBM. I was kind of surprised to see this plastered as a top headline on all the tech sites. From what I see, it seems that tech journalists are willing to lower the bar for RIM in terms of what is considered innovative.</p>
<p>LOL!!</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s the right attitude at least, now innovate and show us some great, fresh ideas!</p>
<p>Seconded. I know the smartphone market is ever expanding but I think it&#8217;s going to be very different to establish themselves and gain sufficient market share so as to attract app developers. I&#8217;m not a huge app user myself but I don&#8217;t deny a vibrant and thriving third party app market is important to an awful lot of people, which is why Microsoft are throwing wad fills of cash at the problem for WP7.</p>
<p>This late to the party RIM need to be more than merely competetive with their platform, they need BB10 to be far in advance of anything that Apple, Google and Microsoft will be launching in the same quarter, to lure those users away from their current platform and app/media ecosystem in which they may be quite heavily invested.</p>
<p>Agreed. Problem is, RIM thinks they&#8217;re in the handset business. They&#8217;re not.They&#8217;re in the communications business.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it again and again: The value behind the BlackBerry phone system is BlackBerry Messenger. It, and the backend services, are what make the platform valuable. Without it, even a new BlackBerry 10 is just a so-so phone with a decent keyboard and a one-trick-pony camera app.</p>
<p>To survive, RIM needs  to hire a team of crack iOS, Android, and Windows developers and use them to create a set of RIM messaging apps based on their existing Enterprise platform. Then sell their customers on having a truly secure cross-platform system for their sensitive corporate communications.</p>
<p>They need to be on iOS. They need to be on Android. They need to be on Window&#8217;s Phone. And they needed to do it a year ago.</p>
<p>Like you said, they&#8217;re NOT going to do it by creating a me-too phone that does little over and above the existing players.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.iSights.org/2012/04/rim-would-prefer-to-license-blackberry-os-wrong.html" target="_blank">http://www.iSights.org/2012/04/rim-would-prefer-to-license-blackberry-os-wrong.html</a></p>
<p>People forget that Microsoft&#8217;s new platform is in a worse shape that any other, including classic Blackberry and Symbian.  Blackberries are outselling Windows Phones by 5 to 1. In order to reach critical mass that attracts developers, all RIM has to do is convincing their existing customers to switch to BB10, while Microsoft has to find a lot of new customers before they could finally gain traction. That&#8217;s much harder.</p>
<blockquote>Blackberries are outselling Windows Phones by 5 to 1</blockquote>
<p>Source please.</p>
<p>Well, I suggest they start with bringing out an alpha build of BB10 with which you can make actual calls&#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite ironic how the playbook had no e-mail and now the first build they show of they&#8217;re phone OS can&#8217;t even make calls&#8230; It&#8217;s like bringing out a prototype car without wheels&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why is called an Alpha&#8230; It probably can make calls thats why it has a SIM card slot. The Alpha device is for Devs to test their apps&#8230; not to use it as a personal phone.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry Thorsten Heins, in it to win it is good in all, but unlikely at the moment. Its the taking part that counts.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s like he has 3 chips left and he&#8217;s putting them all the tables and iOS and Android are sitting across the table just laughing so hard they are crying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty clear though that he means &#8220;winning back market share points&#8221;, not &#8220;winning the market share race, being ahead of its and Android&#8221;.</p>
<p>I actually believe they got a chance, if the OS is what it looks like. ^^</p>
<p>At least with enterprise. And that is a great start and strategy.</p>
<p>OS is just part of the equation.</p>
<p>They definitely need to harass developers by the time it&#8217;s out.</p>
<p>Did the OS make the Playbook succeed in the marketplace? No.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just looks, it&#8217;s functionality and responsiveness.  Compare to android, which never stops lagging and has terrible battery life.  Even a basic iOS clone constructed with UI thread priority, proper battery management protocols and APIs, and a faster language than java running in a freaking VM, could easily dethrone android from 2nd place.</p>
<p>And RIM is doing much more than a simple clone the way google did.  As long as they have a home screen with a grid of icons, not a cluttered screen filled with giant boxes, they will do extremely well.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton 2008 Primary: &#8220;We&#8217;re in it to win it!&#8221;</p>
<p>How did that go?</p>
<p>She got Secretary of State, or 3rd place.  Not too shabby.</p>
<p>Nice response&#8230;lol</p>
<p>All talk until we see finished OS, some devices that are actually available for purchase and developer support behind the new ecosystem.</p>
<p>With Blackberry 10, I&#8217;d say they have now at least a fighting chance against Palm.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s just&#8230; mean.</p>
<p>yeah great start with your latest viral campaign.</p>
<p>My mouth is agape reading the unwillingness to go quietly into that goodnight.  <br />
There will be no Rocky II though for you RIM.<br />

<p>Okay.</p>
<p>OS looks so-so. But it least it is more or less on par with what market expects now. The idea to involve Qt may actually be a good move. Qt developers are not that numerous, but they are rather dedicated to their framework and are currently really pissed off by Nokia betrayal. They may fall for RIM, sure.</p>
<p>But the question of BB10 success lays in very different direction. Starting factors are ok, no definite flop here, but not more then that. BB10 is not disruptive and has no large advantages over competition. So, it all will be about the execution:</p>
<p>1) Can RIM convert their existing user base to the new platform? This is hard, MS failed it with WM6&#8594;WP7, Nokia with Symbian&#8594;WP7, in former times Apple has failed it with OS9&#8594;OSX.</p>
<p>2) Can RIM market the BB10 well enough to convince a new customer to get it over iOS and Android? Traditional security mumbo-jumbo won&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s about mass market now. Will they find the right message to communicate?</p>
<p>3) Ecosystem. They need to build a great ecosystem from almost ground up in about 6-12 months.</p>
<p>In my opinion their chances are low. What they face is difficult and they didn&#8217;t execute good in the last years. PlayBook died because of the poor execution and lack of focus. But at least they have a minuscule chance to stick their foot in the closing door of the runaway train,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve shorted their stock. That tells what I think about the odds.</p>
<p>I went to the casino and I decided to play my chips on black at the roulette. That tells you what I think about the odds. Then I came here and I though my gambling habits would be oh-so interesting to all of you folks.</p>

<p>No, no, take this down&#8230;..thats&#8230;..that&#8217;s not fair.</p>
<p>It was such a softball question, too.</p>
<p>I think he knows what it takes to be number one and that they will be in time!</p>
<p>Interesting though is they came from No.1 to having a clear shot at being No.3. I wish RIM good luck though. They still have a strong international market.</p>
<p>they were never number one</p>
<p>Yes they were.</p>
<p>Surely Symbian had larger share than Blackberry, may be wrong though</p>
<p>Symbian <strike>is</strike>was by no means a smartphone platform.</p>
<p>Symbian was by no means a smartphone platform? Full multitasking, usable mobile (webkit) browser, GPS, turn-by-turn navigation, folders, USB OTG, NFC &#8211; ALL these came to Symbian ages before they reached ANY other OS. Symbian is probably only second to modern Android when it comes to features, and it leads iOS and WP8 BY FAR.</p>
<p>A lot of people who visit TheVerge are based in the US and have no idea what Symbian was.</p>
<p>Nokia was non-existent in the country until for a large period of 5-6 years</p>
<p>Basically, Symbian was the smartphone OS for everyone outside of the USA until the iphone came out.</p>
<p>Symbian was never marketed in the US, for reasons I don&#8217;t know.  That&#8217;s why your average US Verge viewer has a lack of understanding.</p>
<p>There were Symbian devices but they were heavily skinned and controlled by the carriers in the US.</p>
<p>There were Symbian dumbphones, yes. The smarter-but-maybe-not-smart-enough-to-be-called-smartphone version of Symbian had no traction here. Nokia and the Almighty Carriers didn&#8217;t get along. It was all BB, Palm and WinCE.</p>
<p>Regardless, the US is by no means indicative of the global smartphone market. Until the iPhone in 2007, Symbian was both the most powerful and most user-friendly smartphone OS on the planet. Post-iPhone, Symbian may have lost the user-friendliness title, but it remained far more flexible and functional than anything else until perhaps Android 2.1.</p>
<p>Features like full multitasking, third-party app support, customisable menu with folders were already available on the Nokia 7650 in 2002.</p>
<p>on paper it sounds great, but in reality Symbian was a pain to use. I&#8217;m from Europe, and i had at least 3 high end Nokia devices but when iPhone came out there was such a big difference in usability that it didn&#8217;t matter that theoretically you could do more with Symbian.</p>
<p>I feel like Android has as many if not more convoluted drill down menus than Symbian had&#8230; I thinks its rather funny that the things that people complained about Symbian are now the things they complain about Android&#8230; food for thought.</p>
<p>Bottom line, Nokia shouldve fought to have their flagship phones subsidized; that way the OS wouldve matured to S^3 faster. &#8216;Belle&#8217; is a pretty solid OS just a couple years behind. Hell, the Meego experience is Sublime. No &#8216;ecosystem&#8217; though. Suppose thats a huge deal to some&#8230; lol, many.</p>
<p>Before Iphone the carriers had all the leverage and did not want all this smart phoneishness as they didn&#8217;t want to end up as a dumb pipe.  It wasn&#8217;t until Apple rode into town that the carriers had to listen to anyone.  Palm did have some ok traction going but I don&#8217;t think they would have ever opened the flood gates of innovation like what apple did.  Not that other companies didn&#8217;t have the brain power,  it is just that apple had the mind share of the consumer and was able to use it as leverage against the carrier.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I only remember using a Symbian device (forget the model name) a few times back in &#8216;04-&#8217;05 and, being a Treo600 &amp; former Blackberry user, I was not impressed. So the perception that Symbian is a &#8220;dumbphone&#8221; OS stuck with me. If it evolved to do all that, that&#8217;s nice. However, the fact that Nokia failed to properly market Symbian in the US speaks to my lack of knowledge/enthusiasm about the platform, or its potential, at least. So, my apologies on that front.</p>
<p>Which raises another question: if Symbian is indeed on par or &#8220;better&#8221; than modern smartphone OSes such as Android and iOS, why did Nokia essentially ditched it and ran to Microsoft&#8217;s &#8220;Windows Phone&#8221; OS? Is it just to get Microsoft&#8217;s help in acquiring extra  3rd party developer support?</p>
<p>Symbian isn&#8217;t on par or better, but at the time (6-7 years ago) it was the most capable smartphone OS out there.</p>
<p>because elop works for microsoft and not for nokia.</p>
<p>symbian was very capable but people in europe and asian especially would have prefer it to windows phone.</p>
<p>even a year after nokia releasing it first windows phone, symbian still outsell it. with no symbian seen in a year.</p>
<p>Symbian has the features, but is a bit slow, lacks apps, is old fashioned and has a lacklustre and at times frustrating UI, has no ecosystem, and just required too much tidying up to be able to compete. Starting again with Meego was a better idea, but they&#8217;d have been on their own, so going with Microsoft and the Windows ecosystem was the better long term answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;because elop works for microsoft and not for nokia.&#8221;  <br />
Hope your tin hat is on tight.</p>
<p>Ignorance. </p>
<p>Key phrase was &#8220;on features&#8221;. Win7 on tablets is still unsurpassed on features but I doubt many people would argue it was better than iOS, Android or WinRT.</p>
<p>Ummmm&#8230; I had a great Nokia phone with Symbian but I would not call it a smart phone. A feature phone, sure. But please do not pretend it was oh-so-sophisticated, because it most certainly was not.</p>
<p>My N95 would beg to differ. In 2006.</p>
<p>My old N73 Music Edition will wake up from its sleep and kick your ass for that comment</p>
<p>Just because YOU don&#8217;t know how to use it doesn&#8217;t necessitate it not being a smart/sophisticated platform.</p>
<p>You say &#8220;full multitasking&#8221; like it wasn&#8217;t piss-trivial. My Amiga had full multitasking. <i>Managed </i>multitasking is what&#8217;s really difficult.</p>
<p>iOS still doesn&#8217;t offer full multitasking.</p>
<p>&#8220;still&#8221;, as if Apple is working on it but can&#8217;t quite get it ready for release :)  It was a design choice to implement it like it is implemented.</p>
<p>Exactly. It probably took a lot more work to remove &#8220;full&#8221; multitasking from bog-standard UNIX than it would have to leave it in.</p>
<p>I used to remember how my N73 would beat the shit out of first and second gen iPhone in terms of speed and multitasking (not to mention copy and paste, camera and camera flash).</p>
<p>Ofcourse not to forget how iPhone changed everything for good. For Nokia was (still is) getting really sloppy.</p>
<p>I am definitely going to try the Lumia 920 if it comes for less than $500 unlocked.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s possibly the most ridiculous thing I&#8217;ve read on a tech forum.  Symbian was <strong>the</strong> smartphone platform.</p>
<p>Based originally on Psion&#8217;s EPOC. It was strong&gt;always</strong> a smart phone OS. Heck &#8211; it was Smart &#8211; then it became phone.</p>
<p>I think Nokia has some words with you.</p>
<p>Haha if Symbian is not a smartphone platform then there is no such thing as a smartphone platform.</p>
<p>Symbian was definitely a fully fledged smartphone platform. It just didn&#8217;t have an appstore.</p>
<p>It did &#8211; Ovi, and then Nokia, store. Both failed, but even before them you could extend your Symbian&#8217;s functionality almost indefinitely if you can find the right repositories.</p>
<p>Are you living under a rock?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gsmdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/mobile-os-market-share.jpg" /></p>
<p>yeah, 47% for Symbian seems a lot,  but the Smartphone userbase was a lot smaller back than. Now almost all phones are smartphones, you can barely find a dumbphone for sale anymore.</p>
<p>Featurephones dominate the international and developing world market.</p>
<p>Um, in smartphones, sure they were.</p>
<p>They were number one in the US, but not worldwide.</p>
<p>Who, then, was number one worldwide? In smartphones, that is.</p>
<p>Nokia, with their Symbian platform. The Nokia N-series (especially N70, N95, etc) were hugely popular outside the US.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6600" target="new">6600</a> was a good phone. With 6 MB internal storage and v7 os, it would be a laughing stock today but it was a good phone for 2003-2004.</p>
<p>dont forget the N-Gage.. that was a sweet device !</p>
<p>Be quiet you. The N-Gage was worse than Sonys PS phone platform.</p>
<p>it was good smartphone, just not a good phone or gaming platform</p>
<p>I still remember how crazy people were for that phone. It was one of the first phones to have a camera built-in, which seemed revolutionary in those days.</p>
<p>I had the Nokia 3650 which was the first phone that could record video. And, I had the 7650 which was the first phone that could take VGA pictures.</p>
<p>Also, the 3650 on EDGE speed was such a baller phone and I remember reading live scores and stocks it while everyone would run towards their desktop or laptops. I would get my fix everywhere in manhattan and head would turn to look at that ugly phone. I used to have endless debates with AT&amp;T to implement proper EDGE services.</p>
<p>Damn those days :D</p>
<p>had the 3650, if i remember correctly it had an ir blasted on the top, and i would turn off the tvs in class during the morning announcements hahah</p>
<p>This is one of those great divides between the US and the rest of the world. According to sites like this, &#8216;everyone was using a RAZR&#8217; when the original iPhone came out. As I recall, everyone here was using an N95 or a lesser Symbian phone.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know if you are trolling or severely deficient &#8230; before there was iPhones and android there was multitasking, apps  et. all on Symbian</p>
<p>Before there were iPhones, there was Palm and RIM. Nokia/Symbian were nowhere to be seen. In the US, that is.</p>
<p>Most (actually all) &#8220;Symbian&#8221;  (i.e. Symbian based) phones sold here were dumb-phones/ flip phones. If there were some bombshell Symbian smartphone devices, Nokia sure didn&#8217;t make any effort to make it known and get it into one of the largest markets.</p>
<p>Windows mobile powered Palm though.</p>
<p>Only one model, the rest were all Palm OS. WM was trivial.</p>
<p>Nokia was ubiquitous outside the US back then. BlackBerrys were starting to gain some traction, but only hardcore businessmen bought them. No one had even heard about Palm.</p>
<p>Seems like the US market varied a lot from the world market before the iPhone launch.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95</a></p>
<p>i had this phone! paid a lot of money for it and found it amazing at the time.</p>
<p>Now it looks like a relic from another era, like 20 years ago, but it&#8217;s just a few years old&#8230; probably 6 or 7 years only.</p>
<p>Haha! released March 2007, so only 5 and 1/2 years old&#8230; incredible how dated it looks when compared to latest smartphones available right now.</p>
<p>It was pretty good, but it was definitely a geek phone: Nokia threw every possible gadget at it and didn&#8217;t worry too much about the build quality. Great camera though.</p>
<p>The point is that at one time they were synonymous with business and now they are in a struggle for survival because they know that there is only enough room for 3 players in the smartphone market.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t live outside the US, but i know several ppl who did. Nokia was too considered a business phone, at one time. Being the largest world eide, they had a huge advantage over RIM. This is why MS choose to partner with Nokia. Overseas ppl still remember the Nokia&#8217;s being a reliable, amazing device.</p>
<p>Why not, even with the rise of Android/iOS, Blackberry has grown its userbase. Sure, they&#8217;d much sooner have a bigger share too but this could carve out their niche a bit bigger.  They need to licence IMO, bring HTC &amp; Samsung on board to help bring desirable handsets to market which target all demographics. The only thing I can see going for WP is that new-ness feeling where people may have had an iPhone for a number of years and be fed up with the static grid of icons on a probable black rectangle &amp; fancy a change for something strikingly different.</p>
<p>*other than most recent quarter which saw decline in numbers</p>
<p>how is it interesting. whats windows phone 8s market share?</p>
<p>0%, same as BB10, none of them are released.</p>
<p>If they werr launching this year, maybe, but i don&#8217;t think they will win. I wanted a BB10 device. But I&#8217;m nit waiting until 2013 for a new phone. Nokia 920 here i come!</p>
<p>egad man, not four months?! I can&#8217;t blame you, that&#8217;s like.. .almost a third of a year! How could I survive with my current smart phone for that long?!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even more interesting is that he is the leader of a company on is only ambitious enough to go for being number 3.  No one put a time line on it, but still why not strive to be number 1.  When I was in college and only pushed to get by, sometimes I failed and sometimes I squeaked by.  Everytime I pushed to get an &#8220;A&#8221; I scored high and passed classes easily&#8230;Just Saying.</p>
<p>Because he would be ridiculed for saying it out loud.</p>
<p>The competition for 3rd place worldwide is going to end up being between BlackBerry and iPhone. iPhone is losing significant market share around the globe.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/kantar-august-2012-market-share.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2012/09/kantar-august-2012-market-share.jpg</a></p>
<p>In the US iPhone is strong, but it is a weak platform in most regions.</p>
<p>Funny.  Don&#8217;t See China, India, or any African countries there. I guess no one buys phones there.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Fun fact. Blackberry is the #1 smartphone OS in the whole continent of Africa.</p>
<p>Selling 40 million iPhones each quarter says otherwise</p>
<p>Outside the US, they did lose some significant market share in that period. But I think WP (and for that matter, RIM) are not overtaking them just yet.</p>
<p>and who is 2nd, if BB and iOS fight for 3rd? Bada maybe&#8230;?</p>
<p>Blackberry technically is already the #3 in the smartphone OS market. RIM isn&#8217;t starting with a no existent market share like Microsoft is doing.</p>
<p>BB10 will have a 0% market share at launch; and old phones can&#8217;t be upgraded to use BB10.</p>
<p>neither windows phone 8</p>
<p>&#8216;Cept WP8 will have WP7&#8217;s Marketplace and will have been out for at least 4 months before a BB10 phone is out.</p>
<p>But they still have market share unlike MS who has none. Whether it can&#8217;t be upgraded doesn&#8217;t matter they still have market share.</p>
<p>MS doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;no&#8221; market share&#8230; it&#8217;s just very low ;)<br />
They do have significant market share in some countries, like Brazil and Finland (the latter should be obvious why). But mostly, it&#8217;s insignificant at this point.</p>
<p>Ya I get that but when you look at it on a global scale do they even have 1%?</p>
<p>The problem for RIM is that MS is making money even when they&#8217;re not selling their own phones. Money they can then funnel into development of WP. They have licensing deals with half of all major Android OEMs.</p>
<p>It takes a truly great leader to aim for number three!</p>
<p>lol</p>
<p>You know you are in trouble when you have to boldly claim 3rd place is within reach.</p>
<p>3rd place in a market this size is a huge prize. 4th place &amp; below much less so</p>
<p>All they need to gain to be third is to be bigger than Microsoft&#8217;s 3% market share.</p>
<p>3% considering WP is only truly supported on two carriers plus having like 4 phones that&#8217;s pretty good.</p>
<p>Pro tip: the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t follow the weird US model where carriers are in charge. Everywhere else, WP has been widely available since launch.</p>
<p>windows phone have tons of models, just poor sales</p>
<p>Oh jeez. The USA is not the entire world.</p>
<p>THE PRIZE</p>
<p>So why exactly do you think 4th place doesn&#8217;t matter?  You could have 4 players split the market into nearly quarters.  That&#8217;s a really absurd statement.</p>
<p>It is a huge market. That said, it depends how much market share the first N players have, to see whether N+1 and below matters. Currently, iOS and Android have somewhere around 80-85% of the market cornered, so not much left for others right now.</p>
<p>In pretty much every market, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with being number 3.  Heck, HTC is 5th among smartphone manufacturers, Lenovo is 3rd in PCs, Hyundai is the 4th largest automaker, etc etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say RIM has a solid shot at becoming a strong market player in 3rd place&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that MSFT is sitting on $40b in cash stockpiles, and is more than willing to pour money until they hit critical marketshare.</p>
<p>Actually Lenovo is no.2 and in quarter or two they will be no.1.<br />
That said, phone market is different from PC and auto ones, because here it&#8217;s fight of ecosystems, so being 3rd isn&#8217;t all that good.</p>
<p><strong>RIM is entirely clueless&#8230;.   They still think that a single phone with an updated UI is all they need to win the game.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same crappy strategy they had in mind for their PlayBook tablet.</p>
<p>They haven&#8217;t figured out the future is moving towards comprehensive interconnected ecosystems.   It&#8217;s not just about a phone.  It&#8217;s about a desktop, laptop, tablet, living room, and how all your devices, apps, and services, and content all work seamlessly together.</p>
<p>If RIM did this 3 years ago, 2 years ago, maybe even a year ago and they may have had a chance.  That window has long past.</p>
<p>True^</p>
<p>My Bets on Microsoft.</p>
<p>My money&#8217;s on Zombie WebOS</p>
<p>I bet on webOS once (purchased a TouchPad) .. I lost that bet :(</p>
<p>i bet on the playbook once i lost that bet too luckily i was able to sell that thing</p>
<p>Recently put ICS (CM9) on the TouchPad. It&#8217;s actually pretty decent with that ROM.</p>
<p>Good thing HP recently said they will be a force in mobile space with Win8.</p>
<p>Too bad they don&#8217;t ave their own OS&#8230;&#8230;oh wait</p>
<p>My bet is it won&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Glad they have bar set super high</p>
<p>They might as well have realistic goals.</p>
<p>Like Chapter 7 or 11?</p>
<p>In Canada?</p>
<p>Damnit! I totally forgot that little detail.</p>
<p>Ouch! :D</p>
<p>ba dum tish</p>
<p>+1 for your pic, it is hilarious!</p>
<p>When apple first entered the phone market Steve Jobs said he wanted to get at least 10 percent of the market share. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with just being realistic.</p>
<p>I think we wanted 1% in 1 year..</p>
<p>Well he does have a point. How many Windows Phones do you see everyday? How many Blackberries?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s true, but it&#8217;s tough to turn momentum. Microsoft has already turned Windows Mobile momentum around and Windows Phone has a positive market share trajectory, but it took them almost 3 years. Blackberry is still trending downward, and has negative momentum. BB 10 might change that, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen over night, as Microsoft learned with Windows Phone 7. Will RIM even be in business long enough to manage that? By the time they do, how far ahead will Windows Phone 8 be?</p>
<p>The only way I see RIM having a shot at 3rd is if  Microsoft screws up their Windows Phone 8 rollout. Otherwise they&#8217;ll be a distant fourth at best.</p>
<p>Either way, its Microsoft&#8217;s to lose and RIM&#8217;s to win. Both have screwed over customers for long enough.</p>
<p>If Microsoft advertises their phones through the brands (Nokia, etc.) themselves, then the reception may be better. If RIM doesn&#8217;t have another &#8220;hook&#8221; for their OS (BBM is pretty much destroyed by WhatsApp), then they are really a sinking ship.</p>
<p>How has MS screwed over customers?</p>
<p>WP7.8, a nice middle finger to all the early adopters.</p>
<p>Following that logic, Samsung mobile division should be dead by now.</p>
<p>Except Android 2.3 has a better app selection than WP7.&#215;.</p>
<p>Early adopters are ready for an upgrade. 7x has lasted two years.</p>
<p>The Lumia 800 generated real interest and it isn&#8217;t a year old.  I assume if they could upgrade the Lumia to WP8 they would have.</p>
<p>Lumia 900 users look on with rage <strong>less than half a year</strong></p>
<p><strong>Super techie</strong> Lumia 900 users will look on wit rage. The other 95% will have a solid as shit phone that does everything they need it to. And of those super techies, about half will understand nothing was promised and that it was a necessary path.</p>
<p>Since when is providing updates and supporting a platform a &#8220;middle finger&#8221;?</p>
<p>So is it better to not provide updates?</p>
<p>Yeah thats what they are used too&#8230; This 7.8 thing is so confusing ;)</p>
<p>For me personally, I see two ABSOLUTELY AMAZING phones in hardware for WP. HTC 8X and Nokia 920. For RIM, I see a brick, and a brick with a keyboard. The problem is RIM is already too late. People already have bought iOS, Android, and WP games and apps. I know for a fact that when I switched to Android, I was super reluctant and had to decide for months because I had so much iOS content. It&#8217;s also the reason that I will always have at least 1 iOS device at home. WP, although I like it, I&#8217;m not switching to it for at least 2-3 years. It&#8217;s missing high-quality games and apps, and I have no Windows media. RIM, forget it. They have 0 good apps, their software is still meh. And really nothing that beats iOS and Android. WP has the super amazingish innovation with tiles and straight lines everywhere. Android has the advanced and customizable OS, and iOS has easy to use software, straightforward the best quality apps, and best designed first party apps imo.</p>
<p>Rating for games by platform: iOS, WP, Android.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working in a Finnish tech park &#8594; zero blackberries nearly only wp7 (Nokia of course). I also study in a Finnish university &#8594; zero blackberries, zero wp7, some android but  majorly iphones. I guess outside of US RIM has a very stiff uphill battle, as in Europe (at least northern and middle I think) there&#8217;s still brand loyalty for Nokia left, and Asia roots for Samsung or the various Japanese handset makers in the Japanese market.</p>
<p>I work in Stockholm and definitely see more Blackberries than WPs. I guess outside Finland Nokia still has an uphill battle?</p>
<p>Stockholm Syndrome:  when people continue to buy BlackBerries</p>
<p>Heh &#8211; Stockholm syndrome should really be related to continued attempts to find a reasonable rental apartment long after rational hope would have ceased.</p>
<p>True Story&#8230;</p>
<p>Definitely, Finland is Nokia&#8217;s home game. The Finns root for domestic products in general. But  in Germany equally, Nokia still has a pretty high standing (surprisingly, after their customer support nightmares, and of course bad Symbian phones). Generally I&#8217;d say they&#8217;ll have it easier in Europe compared to the States or Asia.</p>
<p>The question to ask is how many WP8 and BB10 devices will people see next year? RIM is one manufaturer while Microsoft has over 5 OEM&#8217;s who can churn out more devices per year if necessary.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>More models does not equal more sales. Just ask Apple.</p>
<p>Also this is RIM. They&#8217;re capable of making multiple models of phones at a time.</p>
<p>Correct. But Microsoft doesn&#8217;t pay for the production of phones, while RIM does. More OEM&#8217;s building more phones does not hurt Microsoft&#8217;s bottom line if the phones don&#8217;t sell, RIM doesn&#8217;t seem to share the same luxury.</p>
<p>Seems like you&#8217;re just picking things as &#8220;problems&#8221; just to make something out of nothing. So you&#8217;re pretty much saying Microsoft doesn&#8217;t give a shit if the OEMs don&#8217;t sell their phones, since the risk is low for them?</p>
<p>Great strategy and mind set&#8230;..</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re forgetting how long RIM has been in this business. They turned their head for 5 years and let the competition slip right by them. They didn&#8217;t forget how to produce phones, especially after selling millions of them.</p>
<p>I still see tons of Blackberries, but i am based near DC so it&#8217;s probably all government workers etc&#8230;</p>
<p>I saw quite a few Nokia Lumias in Moscow this summer. Sure, way less than iPhones or Android devices, but infinitely more than in America (that is, I haven&#8217;t seen any in the US). You have to remember that the US is not representative of the world.</p>
<p>I am aware of that. I live in Hong Kong, total WP phone count to date: 3. A Lumia 800 and 2 Titan 1&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I see a lot more WP&#8217;s actually.</p>
<p>more blackberries</p>
<p>but being third won&#8217;t be hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not just another open platform on the market, we are BlackBerry.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means something to someone?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Why are we talking about a fruit? (lol jk)</p>
<p>Everyone knows what BlackBerry is. Though today that is usually in the context of &#8220;oh, you still have a blackberry?!!!&#8221;, but people still know what it is.</p>
<p>In the UK Blackberry is this thing that teenagers have for some bizarre reason known only to themselves (I think BBM).</p>
<p>Yeah, it annoyed me as hell that all the cool kids bought Blackberries just for BBM, and kept exchanging their pins or whatever. I went to a public school.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also really cheap on PAYG.</p>
<p>It means something to Enterprise. Blackberry has a strong reputation as being THE secure phone for business, because of BES. GOOD is chipping away at that, but many companies and corporate buyers still have a good opinion of RiM. Of course, MS is going to strongly go after these customers, who aren&#8217;t being directly serviced by Apple or Android really (only via third party vendors like GOOD)</p>
<p>Hmm they wanna challenge windows phone 8 huh?</p>
<p>Put it better they wanna challenge Microsoft (and ~nokia). They are not even aiming Apple or Google and thats their first mistake. As history tells every company who tries to fuc* with Microsoft either ends up being sold or bankruptcy and they are pretty close now to any of those. Rip RIM DOA.</p>
<p>Yeah sold and bankrupt, like said Google &#8230;</p>
<p>Uh Apple? Linux?</p>
<p>The linux company?</p>
<p>Well the distro developers, the foundation.</p>
<p>Mozilla Foundation?</p>
<p>What a stupid and invalid statement.</p>
<p>Actually, the way it stands now, WP is challenging RIM who have a considerable lead last I check in market share</p>
<p>True, but MS has positive momentum. WP8 phones can take advantage of WP7 apps as well as have W8 apps easily ported over. Plus MS makes money off of lots of android phones that they can pour into WP. RIM doesn&#8217;t have that advantage.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t kind of sad that he says RIM has A SHOT at number 3?</p>
<p>Yes, imagine the corporate rally at HQ with everyone chanting &#8220;We&#8217;re number three! We&#8217;re number three! Hopefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kinda sad.</p>
<p>JFI, he meant a pun, namely &#8220;rimshot&#8221;. Ba-dum-ch.</p>
<p><strong>flies away</strong></p>
<p>I think they can achieve 3rd place.  They have a large install base now of die hard bbm users and arguably the best platform for enterprise in terms of security and control where they also have a massive install base. Byod is definitely on the rise but not every company will allow it, many will adopt bb10 with whatever new bes they co,e out with.</p>
<p>Blackberries make terrific jam.</p>
<p>Apple makes traffic jam (with their maps)</p>
<blockquote>RIM CEO Thorsten Heins: &#8216;we have a clear shot at being number three&#8217;</blockquote> <p>Translation. Windows Phone 8 ain&#8217;t shit to us.</p>
<p>Translation:  The only competitor we can ever hope to challenge is the one with the least market share.</p>
<p>If Microsoft gets beat by BlackBerry 10 of all things then it&#8217;s time for them to just stop trying.</p>
<p>Microsoft is already beaten by much less things than BB10. Like Bada.</p>
<p>Actually, refer to table 2 and have a nice laugh: <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/08/14/mobile-phone-q2-2012-market-share-sales/" target="_blank">http://www.bgr.com/2012/08/14/mobile-phone-q2-2012-market-share-sales/</a></p>
<p>That actually doesn&#8217;t mean that much.  Bada is a ultra low cost hardware OS that can sell in high volume (thus easier to boost marketshare)</p>
<p>Laugh at what exactly? Year over year, Windows Phone had bigger gains than iOS, gaining 0.9 percentage points compared to 0.6 percentage points. Table two shows RIM losing 5.8 percentage points. Aside from Android, Windows Phone had the biggest gains out of any platform.</p>
<p>Even if growth remains constant across all platforms, Windows Phone will be in 3rd place by next year.</p>
<p>I think once windows 8, the new xbox software update, and windows phone 8 are released WP market share will soar! Especially with all the integration.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s usually not &#8220;smart&#8221; to compare gains in percentage points when dealing with someone with huge marketshare compared to someone with low marketshare. The marketshare can always grow/fall faster. Doubling a user base of 10 to 20, is a lot quicker than doubling 100 to 200.</p>
<p>Not sure if trolling or severely deficient. He wasn&#8217;t quoting percentage change. He was quoting changes in percentage points with reference to total number of devices sold. If it were the former, WP would have grown more than 100%, not 0.9%.</p>
<p>That was the month before the iPhone 5 launch.  Those numbers are meaningless.</p>
<p>at this rate they gotta pass blackberry in 10 years lol</p>
<p>Definitely. WP8 is Microsoft&#8217;s final shot at the smartphone market.</p>
<p>Windows future is on smaller form factors. MS will continue to push tablets and phones in the long run.</p>
<p>of course they gotta keep trying, that it&#8217;s gotta work its a different matter</p>
<p>BlackBerry is currently #3 so&#8230;</p>
<p>no it isn&#8217;t</p>
<p>In terms of market share, it is.</p>
<p>Again, in many markets&#8230;no<br />
<a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/kantar-windows-phone-has-overtaken-rim-market-share-in-usa-key-8-countries/" target="_blank">http://wmpoweruser.com/kantar-windows-phone-has-overtaken-rim-market-share-in-usa-key-8-countries/</a><br />
<blockquote>Kantar has released their market share numbers for the 12 weeks leading up to the 7th August, and it demonstrates that the good July Windows Phone had has pushed it ahead of RIM, making it officially the 3rd biggest OS in USA and also in the Key 8 countries, which include USA, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia and Brazil.<br />
In USA RIM now only has 1.5% market share, while Windows Phones capturing 3.3% of the market.<br />
In the Key 8 countries in total Windows Phone held 4.8% market share, up from 3.5% a year ago, and ahead of Symbian at 3.2% and RIM at 3.8%.</blockquote></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how do you think things are going to fair when the 920 and 8x are released (two <em><strong>somewhat </strong></em>desirable devices) and then an additional 2-5 months pass before the first BB10 handset launches? (A big variance in months being that RIM hasn&#8217;t given real guidance on the launch other than  Q1 2013).  People aren&#8217;t really picking up BlackBerrys in many key markets out of choice anymore, and even companies and agencies that have historical forced users to use BlackBerrys are turning away from RIM (bring your own device policies). But if you think that BB7 and the Torch, Curve and Bold are going to continue to hold things down the fort for another <strong><em>6 months</em></strong>, I guess that&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>I think those kantar numbers are just market share for sales from the quarter, not install base.  So yeah, windows is beating them in terms of sales in the last quarter, but not yet in install base.</p>
<p>However, unless bb10 and the hardware is amazing, it seems inevitable.</p>
<p>In terms of install base, what good is having a BB7 device if BB10 is a 100% clean break. Some of the most ardent supporters of BlackBerrys, people who i used to say &#8216;&#8217;get with the times&#8217;&#8217; 1, 2 and 3 years ago, moved on to other phones, and they don&#8217;t miss BBM or the hardware enough to go back. <br />
As far as the few and far between Crackberry users, what are their feelings going to be like when they see the all new BB10&#8230;and it launches without a hardware keyboard option. A feature that even Josh said lots of ardent users say they can&#8217;t do without.</p>
<p>I think msft knows first hand that legacy users who had to deal with old piss poor products (windows mobile from 2003-2009) are the most reticent ones to give a second chance. And let&#8217;s be honest, there were a lot of users in those years that bought those devices not because they wanted them, but because it was forced upon them. Current trends are far more important than a legacy install base.</p>
<p>there will be a keyboard option and full screen option available pretty much at the same time when it launches</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this very gesture heavy OS operates with a keyboard. I would love to see a demo.</p>
<p>i didnt say it was good or bad. just commenting that the link you cited is referring to marketshare as percentage of a quarter&#8217;s sales. not total install base.</p>
<p>And, yes, as Justin.Kayse mentions, a physical keyboard BB10 device has been confirmed.</p>
<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s launching shortly after the launch of the first BB10 device. Which was my point, maybe i should have stated it more clearly. People are waiting for that next gen bb10 handset w/ a keyboard, the minute some holdouts who don&#8217;t follow tech news see a glass slab, they might just say fugg it and go w/ something else.  But who knows. No matter how you shake it, RIM is in trouble</p>
<p>worldwide is where it matters and they are 3rd.</p>
<p>A lot of their sales that keep them in 3rd are from developing countries like India where operators don&#8217;t have the spectrum or infrastructure to offer cost effective data  plans. It&#8217;s one reason why Lazaridis would always talk about how awesome their web compression was and how much cash they could save for both carriers (in terms of bandwidth) and customers (their bills).</p>
<p>Problem is, a lot of the low end devices they sell in other countries don&#8217;t have the margins they need to keep them afloat, they need high margin items which are always the devices with the high retail selling price.  Perfect example being that Nokia for the most part, kicked their cash cow symbian to the curb, even though it sold relatively well in emerging markets to focus on premium devices with windows phone, then wanted to go down market from there (the 610 and the rumored 510 or 520)</p>
<p>Plus there&#8217;s always the fact that products in many of those &#8216;&#8217;key markets&#8217;&#8217; usually end up being the products that people in developing markets aspire to have. Chinese people, for example, don&#8217;t aspire to have Blackberrys in the future, they want iphones.</p>
<p>They have to beat themselves before they can be number 3, again.</p>
<p>And with what they&#8217;re showing, it gives a lot of current BB users reason to stay with BB versus jumping ship.</p>
<p>Well good luck with that. Microsoft is a ridiculously profitable company that can (and will) spend billions upon billions in research and development, attracting developers and marketing the platform until it gets to where they want it.</p>
<p>RIM doesn&#8217;t have that luxury.</p>
<p>that didnt help, windows mobile. zune, kin, windows phone 7, first xbox.</p>
<p>Arguably their biggest success: Windows 7. And WP8 is basically W8&#8217;s mobile RT form.</p>
<p>Actually, the original Xbox outsold both the Dreamcast and the Gamecube and the 360 went on to be one of the best selling of this generation. Not to mention it&#8217;s been overall the best selling console period in the last year and a half.</p>
<p>And Windows Mobile was actually tremendously successful &#8211; something you don&#8217;t seem to realize. It was right up there with RIM and Palm OS as one of the earliest smartphone OSes available.</p>
<p>Oh, and despite having marketshare basically the equivalent of WebOS &#8211; Windows Phone has over 100,000 apps available in the marketplace. Over 30x what WebOS ever had available even in its &#8220;peak.&#8221; So yeah, it did help. It helped a fucking ton.</p>
<p>Your ignorance is absolutely astounding.</p>
<p>Every industry needs its Commodore-Amiga. You go, RIM!</p>
<p>The Amiga was a terrific piece of hardware years ahead of its time. This analogy limbs to say the least.</p>
<p>It was at the start, until Commodore sat on their hands and did no R &amp; D until it was was junk.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if the analogy works or not, but it might.</p>
<p>Had to do a double take on my google reader feed to make sure this wasn&#8217;t and Onion headline.</p>
<p>LOL.</p>
<p>In a 4-horse race, he&#8217;s aiming to be no. 3. Wow! I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;ll give a lot of confidence to the shareholders and prospective customers.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they already number three? I&#8217;m pretty sure that RIM sells a lot more blackberries to this day than windows phones.</p>
<p>Realistic goal but what a hilarious thing to say.  WE&#8217;RE NUMBER THREE!!! WE&#8217;RE NUMBER THREE!!!</p>
<p>No you dont have a shot at being 3rd.</p>
<p>But like anything in this world &#8211; you have a shot to try to make it.</p>
<p>You do not have a captivating eco system (xbox , tablets, mobile, gaming , productivity, communication)<br />
Your not bridging anything but being a &#8220;look we haz apps too&#8221;</p>
<p>Be realistic. A shot at number 3 NO! but a sub option YES! for those blackberry fans that refuse to believe or even try the fantastic platform currently out there. (WP8, ANDROID, IOS)</p>
<p>If a company doesn&#8217;t have a real shot at being the best at what they&#8217;re doing, they should focus on what they <em>can</em> be the best at.  Clearly RIM doesn&#8217;t feel they can be the best here.</p>
<p>And even if he&#8217;s referring to market share, it will inevitably be construed that he&#8217;s talking about the actual product.  As such, this is a horrendous statement for a CEO to make.</p>
<p>Also, BlackBerry already is the 3rd in smartphone OSes.</p>
<p>Come November, I&#8217;m finally getting my WP8 device. Now that Verizon is in the game, Microsoft&#8217;s has 3rd place on lock down and its only up from there. Look what they did for Android.</p>
<p>I wish RIM actually had a chance. Not that I&#8217;d buy their products, but competition is always good for us consumers.</p>
<p>I wonder the people at RIM actually think they not out of the game&#8230;</p>
<p>Why not #1?</p>
<p>Read the article.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m MS fanboy, I really love to see RIM success in this market as more competition results in better products!</p>
<p>RIM is smoking crack.</p>
<p><em><strong>WE ARE. MARSHALL.</strong></em></p>
<p>and if not Marshall, maybe that community college next door.</p>
<p>Go RIM! Go show Microsoft and Nokia how it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t Challenge Nokia, when u r copying their home grown OS (Meego). They already showed us how it&#8217;s done with N9.</p>
<p>but then they realized that Ecosystem matters, so they adopted WP and abandoned Meego. but it&#8217;s strange what RIM&#8217;s doing (Copying an abandoned OS) :P</p>
<p>Reading this text,  it makes me think of the old sports adage, &#8220;play to win, rather than not to lose&#8221;. RIM is playing not to lose, therefore they eventually will &#8230; lose.</p>
<p>With Windows 8, Xbox 360 going strong, Office 2013, Skype etc I can see WP benefiting and taking the #2 spot. All depends on Marketing execution.</p>
<p>By the time RIM gets BB10 out in the market its most likely around MWC.</p>
<p>Samsung will have the GS4<br />
Nokia might have a better Lumia phone and mid-low range Lumias ready to go. <br />
HTC Nexus + more WP8 phones</p>
<p>Competition is way to strong. I dont see a reason to buy a BB10 phone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good that RIM is being more realistic about it&#8217;s situation. I think pre-Heins, there seemed to be a head in the sand mentality. That being said, if MS does well in pushing the Win8/WinPhone8 package, third may be a hard position to achieve. I really dislike Win8 in terms of creation, but in terms of consumption, I think it does well.</p>
<p>I thought RIM was already a heaping pile of #2?</p>
<p>rule #17 of CEOspeak. if someone has to tell you it&#8217;s Not a unified inbox. it&#8217;s a unified box.</p>
<p>I think wp8 will take the 3rd spot because it will have many different hardware options.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aim low to avoid disappointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looks like they took that seriously. &#8230;.</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they already number three in market share? Last I saw they were at 9%, which was a far back 3rd place.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t see it. My bet is WP8 will take #3. And who knows, the mass market doesn&#8217;t really care about OSes, and so far, as true ecosystem goes, Microsoft has tighter ecosystem then Apple or Google.</p>
<p>Office, Xbox, Windows,  Skype, etc. If they pull it off, it&#8217;s over for RIM. My brother works for AT&amp;T and you won&#8217;t believe how many people he tells me they&#8217;ve converted from BB to WP7 when they tell them WP comes with Office pre-loaded. BB does not mean anything anymore in the US it seems.</p>
<p>WP8 looks like an MS play a la Amazon. It is a half ass&#8217;ed mix of consumer and enterprise hooks wrapped in a walled garden (prison).</p>
<p>Oh&#8230;this just in&#8230;no apps.</p>
<p>It is looking really risky for MS and it&#8217;s base on all client device fronts&#8230;desktop, laptop, tablets, smartphones, pmp (forget pmp)&#8230;</p>
<p>Lol what a troll. Walled gardens are prisons are they? Kay, whatever. Are you suggesting that BB10 <em>isn&#8217;t</em> a walled garden? And no apps? Over 100,000 is &#8220;no apps&#8221;?</p>
<p>Face it, every criticism you just laid on WP8 applies just as much, if not more, to BB10.</p>
<p>Love the spirit of RIM, but sometimes you just need to accept #3 deserves to be someone better, someone efficient, someone called Windows Phone</p>
<p> I picture RIM employees running around campus with those large foam hands you see at football games chanting, &#8220;We&#8217;re number three! We&#8217;re number three!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eye of the Tiger thorsten, Eye of the Tiger.</p>
<p>lol goodluck rim&#8230; we all know microsoft will keep throwing cash till wp8 is strong, kinda like they did with xbox</p>
<p>Is Steve Ballmer the same guy who plays Hank in &#8220;Breaking Bad&#8221;?</p>
<p>Cousins.</p>
<p>Shoot for the stars, you might at least end up on the moon. Shoot for the moon&#8230;</p>
<p>If I were to be generous to RIM I&#8217;d say that Blackberry as a phone brand is far bigger than windows phone. It&#8217;s far easier to sell a product with a trusted brand than with a tainted one and windows as a consumer product is a tainted brand.</p>
<p>Secondly, Blackberry has BBM. Hardcore BBM users reluctantly go to other platforms because Blackberry doesn&#8217;t have the latest apps. So the mission is really to plug that gap and stem the flow of users moving to apple or android. It&#8217;s not as if existing BlackBerry users are locked in to the platform with apps. If they can upgrade to another platform than its conceivable that they could move to bb10. The difference will be that they will keep their BBM pin and settings and hopefully have a user experience equal to the other modern phone platforms.</p>
<p>Thirdly, BB10 platform looks more like the existing iOS or Android UI&#8217;s than Windows Phone does. Windows Phone is WAY out there in terms of UI. As nice as think windows phone UI is there is such a thing as being too different. I think BB10 can benefit from being closer in look and feel to iOS,  because it will give existing blackberry owners a reason to stay with the platform. They could feel like they are getting iOS and Android level product win moving platform and keeping their existing BBM pin and settings.</p>
<p>On the software side RIM have made it incredibly easy to develop for this system than any other platform maker. The HTML/JS framework is all hardware accelerated. And the c++ side looks good plus the UI framework stuff. So if this platform does gain traction it&#8217;s going to be easy for devs to move software to that platform.  Plus RIM generally have an OS framework that allows devs easy access to customising the machines operation (I.e. adding system menus or integrating things like messaging software in to the main messaging platform) something that iOS and WP7/8 just won&#8217;t allow. These are all pretty good things going forward.</p>
<p>The two things RIM really need to do is provide a cheap £200 bb10 version of the curve and a £400 version of the bb10 bold. I think they need to start showing some next gen games and apps now to get the press a bit more positive. If they can get the price point right Microsoft will have a massive battle on their hands to keep wp8 relevant in carriers eyes.</p>
<p>The thing that many people forget is that the key to selling phones is having good relationships with carriers. RIM have that and yet have the brand. I&#8217;m not saying it will definitely work and they will have to be focused in execution but they are but no means all over.</p>
<p>&#8217; a clear shot at number 3&#8217; ??? What a big mouth! Better show what you have let&#8217;s the consumer judge.</p>
<p>Personally.. I&#8217;d go for Blackberry to succeed.</p>
<p>Personally.. I&#8217;d go for Blackberry to succeed.I absolutely hate metro UI.  Its disgusting.</p>
<p>From the videos I&#8217;ve seen, BB10 LOOKS too similar to iOS for my tastes. A grid of app icons&#8230; no thanks. And they&#8217;re all surrounded by some ugly blue box, it looks as outdated as iOS! I&#8217;m not saying the functionality is the same, obviously their flow and multitasking stuff is NOT like iOS, it&#8217;s probably much better. But the look for the UI does absolutely nothing for me.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re Number 3!<br />
We&#8217;re Number 3!<br />
We&#8217;re Number 3!<br />
&#8230;<br />
Yeah, it just doesn&#8217;t have the same ring to it.</p>
<p>No. 3? Still a loser in the grand scheme but keep dreaming; those seats are taken.<img src="http://thecensus.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/50-cent-and-earnie.gif?w=590" /></p>
<p>I wonder who&#8217;s dreaming, they are already number 3 omenshyne</p>
<p>No, just no. Number 5 if your lucky. Heres how it will rank in terms of devices at least for the next 2 years.<br />
1. android <br />
2. iOS <br />
3. wp7/8 <br />
4. still probably something else<br />
5. RIM</p>
<p>You have a better chance of going bankrupt then becoming the #3 mobile OS.</p>
<p>Windows phone on the other hand actually has a chance of moving up in the boards. Android user from what i can tell, actually do like windows phone which may one day cut into their sales. I also think windows phone will get a huge boost from windows 8.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, i am completely biased against RIM.</p>
<p>In US :<br />
1.Android and iOS (Tablets and Phones  , iPod Touches combined , difference is very less)<br />
2.WP<br />
3.Rest</p>
<p>Worldwide:<br />
1.Android<br />
2.iOS (may come to 3)<br />
3.WP (maybe it will jump to 2 cuz of tablets , phones combined) (I surely doubt it till 2015 or so)<br />
4.Rest</p>
<p>&#8220;You climb a mountain step by step.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or you face plant all the way down.  I know WP isn&#8217;t blowing the lid off but it&#8217;s not hemorrhaging users.  It&#8217;s just growing slower than the others.</p>
<p>Amazing that folks are still willing to bet on BB. It&#8217;s over, folks move on. They&#8217;re aiming for number 3 when even if they were successful it&#8217;s table scraps that won&#8217;t deliver real growth. They have no way of luring buyers from either Android or iOS. And if Amazon came out with a phone tomorrow they would surely put up a better fight against Windows than BB ever could. Basically we&#8217;re looking at company in perennial decline until the market truly puts it out of its misery and forces bankruptcy, or another company buys them and guts it.</p>
<p>he must be drunk.</p>
<p>they have nothing to compete with upcoming windows phones.</p>
<p>they have a generic touchscreen based os that has no traction and no users and nothing new to bring to the table.</p>
<p>Way to keep the expectations lowered.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t wait to get my BB10 in January&#8230;just when my contract expires.</p>
<p>if it actually comes out by then&#8230;</p>
<p>Nothing like aiming to be number&#8230;three.</p>
<p>Blackberry has become the Myspace of the mobile phone companies&#8230; It&#8217;s just not cool to be seen using it.</p>
<p>Our friend Heins badly needs as drink.</p>
<p>At least he aims high.<br />
I always tell my kids to go for #3 :P</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;We have a clear shot at being the number three platform on the market. We&#8217;re not just another open platform on the market, we are BlackBerry.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>This made me laugh, I think he meant to say &quot; We&#8217;re not just another open platform on the market, we are already dead in the water .</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>I had a blackberry bold 9000 for a year and i loved the phone. Email worked great, BBm was a great experience but i believe that RIM has some serious work to do. The lack of apps is there major problem and the quality of current apps is ridiculous . As for as them being No. 3, i dont see it.</p>
<p>What a second!  First, this story. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpAOwJvTOio">Now, this</a>.  It&#8217;s all so clear!  RIM ObamaPhone!</p>
<p>I almost mistook this as MeeGo Harmattan running on a Blackberry device. BB10 looks very similar to it, but it does looks nice to use though.</p>
<p>What about &#8216;Flow&#8217; and &#8216;Peek&#8217;?</p>
<p>It looks the the iPhone (UI)</p>
<p>this is kinda of interesting. i hope it works out for them. Also, i have the urge to photoshop pink slips in his hands.</p>
<p><img src="http://thumbs.myopera.com/sz/colx/BOSOX/albums/36990/M1.png" /></p>
<p>BB10 os arriving in major automobile  companies would make a lot of sense and create a familiarization with people purchasing those vehicles and may drive them to buy rim tablets and phones assuming app and functionality is the same or similar across each device.</p>
<p>Syncing your pictures, videos, email, calendar, navigation across all your devices would be really cool and something that is new to the industry.   If the cars are connecting through Rims, NOC, you could mostly count on the compression and reliability  of the communication between everything.</p>
<p>Imagine when you car, through bb10, setups dealer service checkups, orders replacements parts in to the dealer before your appointment and verifies that you are free to take your car in for service?</p>
<p>Seem too outlandish? There are products out there already being used by high end car manufacturers.  If Rim can become the standard, their future would look pretty bright, regardless of what happens with the handset division.</p>
<p>This sounds like some of the things Palm was saying in their final days. Is there honestly anybody out there saying to themselves, &#8220;Man, if we could just get our hands on a BB OS license, our problems would be solved&#8221;&#8230;? Really?</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve read QNX is in 95% of cars&#8230; RIM is probably thinking of licensing BB10 to auto makers not another phone manufacture. If the Porsche 911 QNX car is any indication of how RIM will implement BB10 into cars&#8230;they have a great chance to succeed.</p>
<p>Microsoft is in every Ford. Google looks like it wants to be in every other car. If I&#8217;m Lexus, and both RIM and Google approach me about using their software to power my hardware, I think I&#8217;m going with Google.</p>
<p>QNX is a real time OS that RIM bought some years ago. Most systems that rely on realtime operations (Like the central CPU of a CAR) already have QNX installed and running (more than 95% of the market on cars). The thing is that its not related to the entertainment system that ussually is from other company.  BB idea is to provide a way that the all the car operations (including entertainment) is commanded from the same system that happens to be BB10 (QNX derived). Google or Microsoft cannot do this because their kernels are not designed to control real time systems (engine, abs, etc).</p>
<p>This is smart. I hope they do it. So far no single manufacturer that has made their own OS has succeeded (besides Apple). RIM may dream of the old days, but whether they like it or not, the only way to succeed in today&#8217;s market is to cooperate with as many manufactures as possible to create a strong enough ecosystem that can be an alternative to the iPhone.</p>
<p>I believe they really have a shot at Samsung, HTC and LG now to convince them to try BB10 as second OS for the enterprise market. WP7 has been a failure for them, and I image they are pretty annoyed at how close Microsoft is to Nokia how and how Nokia is getting all the fame for WP7, even though if it weren&#8217;t for them, we wouldn&#8217;t be talking about WP7 anymore right now. But live and learn.</p>
<p>First of all LG made mediocre phones for WP and blamed the OS for poor sales. Meanwhile you don&#8217;t see Samsung or HTC complaining. Why? Because those  companies didn&#8217;t phone it in (no pun intended).</p>
<p>On the Android side how does LG not get crushed by Samsung, HTC, Moto/Google, and lose the little bit of profit they are making ? Maybe if they do a 180%  in design and R&amp;D, but once again that&#8217;s not an OS problem.</p>
<p>Also how is the Microsoft / Nokia relationship different from the Google / Motorola Mobility relationship? Is  Motorala&#8217;s favorite child status going to scare off Android OEMs?</p>
<p>Great. Now that keyboard can be retarded on two platforms.</p>
<p><em><strong>RIM Invents World&#8217;s Slowest Keyboard</strong></em></p>

<p>They need to demonstrate how the tech works. If the person typing was gong fast nobody would understand what was going on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure its much faster when you are used to it and using it yourself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually interested in this tech, but its too bad I won&#8217;t get a blackberry or jailbreak a phone.</p>
<p>PWNED</p>
<p>Is it as good as Swiftkey&#8217;s prediction?</p>
<p>Doubt it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s made by Swiftkey. Right?</p>
<p>I would assume so since Swiftkey actually provides the tech behind the BB10 keyboard.</p>
<p>Is this supposed to be retro-chic like Instagram?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Doc Brown will allow me to use his DeLorean to travel 6 years back in time to look at something that was never good to begin with.</p>
<p>All that stuff you just wrote down, none of it made sense.</p>
<p>The &#8220;all that stuff&#8221; that I wrote down was less than 140 characters. It&#8217;s good to know that the Twitter generation has reduced their mental capacity to just memes.</p>
<p>Understand that?</p>
<p>Your original comment added nothing to the conversation, and your rebuttal to the reply made even less sense  :{)</p>
<p>I think the Twitter Generation just wants to know what you&#8217;re talking about.  And feel free to make it a Twitlonger.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t understand the difference between the past and what exists today?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry I wrote in too many characters. I should&#8217;ve given a gif of some random meme for you too understand.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Here it is:</p>
<p><img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l3bxfoOYfX1qz8opmo1_400.gif" /></p>
<p>GIF&#8217;s ftw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>No, you don&#8217;t seem to understand.  People definitely understand the difference between the past and the future.</p>
<p>And people definitely understand that Instagram is faux-vintage, retroism, all that nonsense.</p>
<p>People know who Doc Brown is and what he did with a DeLorean according to the story of &#8220;Back to the Future&#8221;.</p>
<p>What no-one can understand is what the hell you&#8217;re on about.  You have to realise that communication isn&#8217;t about being understood.  It&#8217;s about <em>making yourself</em> understood.</p>
<p>Now: what about a new type of virtual keyboard is retro-chic?  How does it relate to Instagram- a photo application?  This kind of virtual keyboard tech didn&#8217;t exist six years ago, so why would you go back in time to see it?  What wasn&#8217;t good to begin with?  Virtual keyboards?</p>
<p>Those are the questions you have left people with.</p>
<p>So brave.</p>
<p>I expect there will be more users on iOS than on Blackberry 10.</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a lousy joke, but BlackBerry users (i know) tend to love the BB for the excellent keyboard. Getting them on board with a touchscreen keyboard will be hard enough. Then expecting them to use this new predictive system doesn&#8217;t seem likely. If there&#8217;s an easy option to turn it off, i expect many who stick with BB through to OS 10 to do so.</p>
<p>I think BB need to release one last premium device to the business crowd based on the 9000 series with a stipped down OS (no maps, browser, social networking BS) and no touchscreen. Lots of memory. Charge a premium and all the BB users that need it for their business will buy them up in bulk, knowing it the last of a breed of device.</p>
<p>Never become a strategist please. Why would RIM provide a device without any of the functions it already has lying around for a final huzzah? What&#8217;s the point of lots of memory if the OS is stripped down? What would make the device different from all of their recent offerings?</p>
<p>Because for a long time BB devices have been a POS, due to them cramming all this new crap into hardware that cannot handle it.</p>
<p>Ask a BB user from the mid &#8217;00&#8217;s which worked better? The new devices should be great. They&#8217;re not. People who use them for business &#8211; real business just want to be able to email quickly and proficiently. They don&#8217;t need the rest of the add ons that only serve to tax the limited hardware specs.</p>
<p>The crowd that like the Maps, social networking, BBM, browser software (read &#8211; mostly teens / young adults) will be coming over to OS 10 as that OS looks like it&#8217;s made for that stuff and I&#8217;m sure will be great at it.</p>
<p>Some people just need to get through hundreds of emails a day and be able to get back to any email in the last year (or more) quickly. BB&#8217;s are lousy for this job. It used to be their MO.</p>
