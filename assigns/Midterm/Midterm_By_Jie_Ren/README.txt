Since I am auditing in this class, I didn't collaborate with anyone for the mid-term assignment. I understand that given the limited time frame for team presentation, I may not get the chance to present. Nevertheless, I just want to submit some interesting findings (I used python and R to retrieve data from Twitter and YouTube for these findings, and mainly used d3.js to present the results).
