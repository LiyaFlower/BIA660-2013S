u: neutral
n: negative
p: positive

Among all these methods, I choose to use logistic regression because of the highest accuracy. Besides, the amount of tweets that are negative and predict as positive is the same as the amount of tweets that are positive but distinguished as negative. So in this case, even some of the tweets are miscalssified, the number in total won't be affect much.
