Assignment:

Put together a creative webpage that has CSS and Javascript / jQuery
elements.  The purpose of the page should be to advertise this class or the
subject of this class (Big Data, Web Analytics, etc.) in some way.  Think
of this as the landing page for the class website.  The page does not have
to be fancy, but it does have to have HTML, CSS, and Javascript / jQuery
elements.  The more time you put into it, the better it will be.

Note: Work in teams of 2-4 people.
